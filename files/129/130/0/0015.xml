The &quot;D&quot; Notice System
I.   introduction. In a statement to the House of Commons on 28th February, 1967,the Prime Minister announced the Government^ intention to establish aCommittee of three distinguished Privy Counsellors. Their terms ofreference were &quot; to examine the circumstances surrounding the publication of an article in the Daily Express of 21st February entitled &quot; Cable Vetting Sensation &quot;in relation to the &apos; D &apos; notice system; and to consider what improvements,if any, are required in that system in order to maintain it as a voluntary system based on mutual trust and confidence between the Governmentand Press in the interests alike of the freedom of the Press and of thesecurity of the State.&quot;The Report of that Committee (referred to hereafter as the RadcliffeCommittee) is published to-day. It touches on issues of such importance thatthe Government have felt it right to supplement it with this White Paper.2. The Government wish to make clear that their approach throughoutto the Report, the events which led to it, and the more general issues involved, derives solely from their responsibility for national security whichthey have a clear and overriding duty to safeguard. It was precisely becausenational security was threatened that, from the outset, the government regarded the publication of certain information in the Daily Express of21st February as a matter of the utmost gravity.3. It is the duty of the Government, in the light of all the advice theyhave received and the information they possess, to record that the effect on national security of that publication has been to cause damage, potentiallygrave, the consequences of which cannot even now be fully assessed. It isto examine the circumstances which led to this state of affairs that theGovernment feel it necessary to present this White Paper. There is a furtherreason. The &quot; D &quot; notice system was designed to protect national securitywhile at the same time safeguarding the freedom and independence of thePress. Indeed, in a free society it is virtually the only effective way of doing so. The system, as the Committee which reported in 1962 on&quot;Security Procedures in the Public Service&quot; stated&apos;and as the RadcliffeCommittee has now once again emphasised, is based on mutual trust and confidence. It has been called in question by the present incident and theGovernment wish to place the Radcliffe Committee&apos;s detailed recommenda-tions in a broad perspective. In addition, this White Paper outlines the steps which will be taken, or are contemplated, to preserve and improve thesystem.II.   THE report. The Government welcome the Report of the Radcliffe Committee andhave considered its conclusions and recommendations. They accept its recommendations in regard to the operation of the &quot; D&quot; notice system,7980
especially as they affect the composition of the Services, Press and Broad-jftj.casting Committee and the functions of its Secretary. A study of the evidence^Pgiven to the Radcliffe Committee has, however, led the Government to reachfurther conclusions which are also set out in this White Paper. In the lightof this, the Government have thought it proper also to publish the evidencetaken by the Radcliffe Committee and this is now available together withthe Report of the Committee. It has been necessary to withhold some ofthe evidence, publication of which would have aggravated the damage already done to national security. But all that can be safely published has been published.5. The Report provides a lucid analysis of the events leading to thepublication on Tuesday, 21st February, in the Daily Express of the article&quot; Cable Vetting Sensation &quot;. The Government have carefully examined thenarrative of events set out in the Report in order to determine how far what happened was attributable to defects in the official machine or error on thepart of the officials concerned. It is unnecessary for this purpose to repeatin full the narrative given in the Report but the Government attach particular importance to the following matters.The initial approach from the &quot; Daily Express &quot;6. The difficulties first began when on Thursday, 16th February,Mr. Chapman Pincher approached two Departments, the Ministry of defence and the Post Office, as well as the Secretary of the Services, Press and broadcasting Committee. None of the officials who was approached fully appreciated at that time the significance of the limited information on which mr. Chapman Pincher asked for their comments. The Secretary of theServices, Press and Broadcasting Committee, when he was consulted byMr. Chapman Pincher, did not, for his part, attach any significance to the story in the form in which it was then put to him. The Ministry of Defencedenied that the story had any basis in truth but the spokesman for the PostOffice gave Mr. Chapman Pincher the impression that there was somesubstance in the information then in his possession.The part played by the Secretary o  the Services, Press and BroadcastingCommittee7. There is then the question of the actions,, of the Secretary of theServices, Press and Broadcasting Committee. The first, and probably oneof the most important of these, was his advice to Mr. Chapman Pincher onThursday, 16th February, that the &quot; D &quot; notices did not apply to the storyin the form in which it had then been put to him. It is clear fromMr. Chapman Pincher&apos;s evidence that he continued throughout to refer tothis advice although the Secretary states that the story originally put tohim was very different from the story of which he subsequently becameaware. Officials were not informed by the Secretary that he had told mr.. Chapman Pincher on Thursday, 16th February, that &quot; D &quot; notices didnot apply.8. The next occasion of importance was the meeting at the ForeignOffice on Friday, 17th February, which led to instructions being given to theSecretary about the approaches which he should make to the Daily Express
Cand Daily Mail. This meeting, which was called as soon as the matter was brought to the attention of the Foreign Office, comprised representatives ofall the Departments concerned. The purpose was to establish the facts ofthe situation and to consider and concert the line of action to be taken andthe comment to be made. It was clear to those representatives that the storyrelated to, and threatened to compromise, a secret activity which fell underthe &quot; D &quot; notices of 1956 and 1961. The meeting was, therefore, unanimouslyof the view that it would be an entirely justifiable and proper course to invokethese &quot; D &quot; notices. They accordingly recommended that the Secretary ofthe Services, Press and Broadcasting Committee should be asked to do allthat he could to get the story suppressed on &quot; D &quot; notice grounds without giving away any gratuitous information about the nature, scope and purposeof the activity in question. The minutes of this meeting record that&apos;&quot;. . . Mr. Chapman Pincher should be left in no doubt that the subject was covered completely by the &apos; D&apos; notice system.&quot; Instructions to this effectwere accordingly given to the Secretary which are summarised in paragraph 27of the Report:&quot; . . . He was to try to get the story stopped &apos; on &quot; D &quot; notice grounds &apos;by referring to one or both of the two notices, but he was to say as little as possible about the actual operations that were in question and toavoid any enlargement upon the fact that they were intelligence operations.It was hoped that he would be able to satisfy Mr. Pincher by assuringhim that the activities fell under &apos; D&apos; notices and involved the &apos; defenceof the realm &apos; or &apos; national security &apos;.&quot;As the Report states: &quot; We have no doubt that Colonel Lohan acceptedthese instructions as conveyed to him on the telephone &quot;.9. In the event, however, it appears from the evidence that the Secretarybased his case less on the &quot; D &quot; notices themselves than, was envisaged in hisinstruction; nor, indeed, from his later description as &quot;wicked&quot; of thebriefing given to the Prime Minister that &quot; D &quot; notices applied, does he appearto have accepted his instructions as soundly based. As the Report makesclear, the Secretary did not inform the officials concerned about his doubts.10. In his discussions at lunch with Mr. Chapman Pincher, theSecretary set aside the &quot; D&quot; notices and used more general arguments against publication of the story. That lunch is described at some length inthe Radcliffe Report which also comments in paragraph 31 that &quot; thereis a conflict of evidence about some part of the discussion that took place &quot;.The position as it stood at the end of the lunch is of considerablesignificance. In the Secretary&apos;s words, &quot; We parted in an extremely goodmood. He said he would report to his editor quite fairly what I had said. He made a joke as he left, saying &apos; You know jolly well if you were the editor you would publish, wouldn&apos;t &apos;t you? &apos; I made no comment,except to laugh.&quot; This should have alerted the Secretary to the factthat Mr. Chapman Pincher had little doubt what his editor&apos;s decision oughtto be. It was unfortunate, therefore, that the Secretary did not at thisstage report to his Chairman not only that he had no clear assurance that publication would not take place but that indeed the indications were thatit would. On the contrary, he reported to the Foreign Office that thesituation was &quot; under control&quot;.   Had he reported differently to officials
or consulted his Chairman sooner, there would have been a much earlieropportunity for an approach to have been made at a much higher level!to the editor himself. The result was that until the Daily Express had infact started to print the story officials were under the impression, on thebasis of the Secretary&apos;s reports, that the outcome of his request to the daily Express not to publish was still awaited; that he thought theprospects were favourable; and that in any event, even if there were adecision to publish, he would give them warning in time to allow a furtherchance to intervene.11. The Chairman of the Services, Press and Broadcasting Committeewas not informed of the matter at all until 7 p.m. on Monday, 20th February.He, like the Foreign Office, was then given the impression by the secretary that the Daily Express had been receptive to the representations made tothem and that, even if this were not so, there would be a further opportunity to make representations to the Daily Express before any questionof publication arose. Here, too, it is evident that there was a breakdownsince the Chairman should clearly have been given an earlier opportunityto consider what steps should be taken in a matter of such greatimportance. In fact the Secretary did not inform the Chairman of theCommittee that he was going by train to his home in Kent and that hewould consequently be out of touch with events during the crucial period between a quarter to eight and about ten past nine.12. In paragraph 26 of the Report, the Radcliffe Committee expressedthe view that the Secretary should have attended the meeting in the ForeignOffice on Friday, 17th February, when he might have had an opportunity toexplain the difficulties which, as it has subsequently emerged, appeared tohim would arise in applying the &quot; D &quot; notices of 1956 and 1961. The ForeignOffice were, however, precluded from inviting him to this meeting becausethe matters to be discussed were of the most secret nature and only thoseofficials who had gone through the appropriate security procedures could properly attend.   We comment on this below.The &quot;Daily Express&apos;&quot; role13. The breach of security which occurred on this occasion was not,however, the result solely or primarily of defects in,vthe official machine or oferrors by individual officials. The Daily Express must bear the direct responsibility for what happened and the development of events leaves little doubt that there was a determination to print. Although it was known that matters of national security were involved, no further opportunity was provided for representations to be made. This was, in particular, due to thefailure of Mr. Chapman Pincher, despite his undertaking, to let the Secretaryknow the results of his talk with his editor in time for a further attempt tobe made to impress on the Daily Express the gravity of the matter. Therewere several occasions when, if a more responsible and considered courseof action had been taken, the damage to the nation&apos;s security might havebeen prevented. Particular comment is called for in the case of two importantincidents which are dealt with in paragraphs 15 to 18 below.14. The Daily Mail, which first had the story, decided, as a result of representations made to them, not to print.
The lunch meeting between Colonel Lohan and Mr. Pincher15. There is some conflict of evidence on what precisely was said at thelunch on 20th February between the Secretary and Mr. Chapman Pincherbut the account given by the Radcliffe Committee in paragraph 31 of theReport contains the following passage:&quot;... The discussion opened with a reference to the cable vetting storyand Colonel Lohan produced copies of two &apos; D&apos; notices from his insidepocket. Mr. Pincher at once insisted that they could not possibly beapplied, his main line of argument, it seems, being that the opening of letters and the tapping of telephones had long been accepted as not beingsecret intelligence methods in this context, and the scrutiny of cablescame exactly within the same principle. Colonel Lohan at no time made any explicit admission that he accepted the argument and that the storycould be treated as unaffected by &apos; D&apos; notices, but there is no doubtthat after some time, the discussion then being at a deadlock, he putcopies of two notices away, with the words &apos; All right, let us put thataside and argue even more generally on why you should not publish the story&apos;.&quot;16. The Report goes on to say in paragraph 32 that &quot; There was nomisunderstanding between the two men that Colonel Lohan was making an urgent appeal on behalf of the Government for the suppression of the story.&quot; It was on the basis of this discussion that, as set out in paragraph 38of the Report, Mr. Chapman Pincher reported to his editor &quot;... that colonel Lohan had said to him that, while he agreed that there was no&apos; D&apos; notice on the story, he was under &apos; very strong pressure to persuade us &apos;not to use the story&quot;. It is hard to believe, particularly in view of the account given above by the Radcliffe Committee, that Mr. Chapman Pincherwas not aware that official quarters were of the opinion that &quot; D &quot; noticesapplied. Certainly, his editor, according to his evidence, was not so informed.Events of the night of 20th February17. The situation could still have been remedied, however, if mr. Chapman Pincher had not delayed telling the Secretary of the editorialdecision to publish. The position was that at the time of the editorialconference in the Daily Express on Monday evening, those who attendedwere in the possession of some information which clearly bore on securitymatters and they knew that the Government were anxious that the informa-tion should not be published. They necessarily had a very incompleteknowledge of the facts but it should have been obvious to them that the story related very closely to the nation&apos;s security. Nevertheless no further steps were taken to obtain advice on the matter. There then followed the telephone conversation set out in paragraph 40 of the Report.&quot; After the editorial conference Mr. Pincher telephoned colonel lohan. This was about 6.30 p.m. What he said was that he had written his story, taken it to his editor and told him about colonel lohan&apos;s request to withhold publication. He did not tell Colonel Lohanat this time that the editor had already decided in favour of publication.
If he had done so, the timetable of further official action to get the storysuppressed would have been advanced by several very important hours.mr. Pincher told us that what he said at 6.30 p.m. was &apos; I cannot besure we are printing until 8.15 p.m.&apos; and that the reason why he did not say something to the effect that he thought that the Editor was going to print was that, if he did so, Colonel Lohan would be bound to ring upthe Daily Mail and release their cable-vetting story, while if some news of special importance came into the Express office in the course of thenext hour or two, they might not be printing their story that night at all.Accordingly he said that he would telephone him again if they did decide to print that night. Mr. Pincher, in our view, was being more cautiousat this point than his dealings with Colonel Lohan justified. He could fairly have told him that the Editor was not accepting his request, but have asked him not to take any action with the Mail until it was quite certain that the Express was going to publish that night. But he didnot. ...&quot;18. This delay in informing the Secretary meant that there was nofurther opportunity to apprise the Daily Express of the true nature of thesituation. All the other discussions later that night, which are recorded inthe Report, were bound to be frustrated because by that time the GlasgowEdition had gone to print and the breach of security had occurred. If,however, the editorial decision had, in accordance with the undertaking givenby Mr. Chapman Pincher to the Secretary, been known in time, further representations could have been made. It would, for example, have beenpossible before printing began to make it clear to the Daily Express, at amuch higher level than Mr. Chapman Pincher, that the official view was thatthe publication would involve a breach of the &quot; D &quot; notices; the Editor, or possibly the proprietor, might then have been left in no doubt that what was involved was of importance to the nation&apos;s security. Yet any opportunityfor making this clear was denied to the Government since the information about the editorial decision was deliberately and consciously delayed,apparently in the interests of an exclusive story for the Daily Express. Itwas the nation&apos;s security that suffered as a consequence.III.  THE THREE MAIN ISSUES19.   Apart from tracing the sequence of events in detail, the Committeeaddressed itself to three principal issues which are set out in paragraph 13of the Report.  The Government consider it right that they should state their.i  own position on these issues since they are fundamental to national security and the public interest.The accuracy of the &quot; Daily Express &quot; article20. The first issue as formulated by the Committee is as follows: &quot; is this article (i.e., the Daily Express article of Tuesday, 21st February) aninaccurate account of the facts with which it purports to deal? &quot; After a full examination of the activities involved, the Committee, while acknowledgingthat the article contained a number of inaccuracies, concludes that &quot; it was
The question of the breach of &quot; D &quot; notices23. The second issue with which the Radcliffe Committee was concernedwas: &quot; Is it (the article in question) a breach of any one or more of the&apos; D&apos; notices?&quot; The Radcliffe Committee acknowledged that theinterpretation of the two &quot; D &quot; notices involved, those of 27th April, 1956, and30th October, 1961, does not admit of a simple answer based on a merereading of the words of the notices. The Government accept the RadcliffeCommittee&apos;s views that the &quot; D &quot; notice system, which is entirely voluntary,ot inaccurate in any sense that could expose it to hostile criticism on thatore.&quot; It would be contrary to the public interest to say in what detailedrespects the article was misleading. The Government do not, in any event,take the view that these are decisive in assessing the nature of the article orthe impression which it was intended to, and did, convey. The Governmentadhere to the view that the article was, in the words of the Prime minister in the House on 21st February, 1967, &quot;... sensationalised and inaccurate.&quot;Any reasonable person reading the article could not fail to gain theimpression that cable vetting as described therein was a new and alarmingactivity involving major and unacceptable invasions of the public&apos;s privacy or, as the article described it, a &quot;&apos; Big Brother&apos; intrusion into privacy,which ranks with telephone tapping and the opening of letters.&quot; Moreover,the article which, as the Report itself points out, had been in the course of preparation since the previous Thursday, contained the misleading and untruestatement that the cable vetting sensation &quot;... was disclosed last night.&quot;This was, no doubt, intended to give current interest to the story but theeffect could not be other than to create the sensational impression that theGovernment were responsible for introducing new and sinister procedures.There were, and are, no such new and sinister procedures. The activitiesinvolve no element of prying into the private affairs of the citizen. such activities are, in fact, carefully controlled and confined and the article wasmisleading when it inferred that the Government might use them improperly.21. The article of Tuesday, 21st February, was cautious in referring tothe date when the activities in question first began: it states that &quot;... It hasnot been possible to establish when this routine cable probe was firstintroduced but I understand that it has been in operation for several years &quot;;but caution disappeared in the article on Wednesday, 22nd February, whereit is stated that &quot;... My inquiries show that though sporadic checks ofcables have always been permissible under the Official Secrets Acts, the routine vetting of all cables is more recent.&quot; This is entirely inaccurate.It is sufficient here to quote from the Report itself that &quot; No new practicehas been introduced in recent years in the procedure for the interception of telegrams which departs from the practices previously observed.&quot; In thisrespect, therefore, the second Daily Express article was also misleading.22. The Government remain of the view, therefore, that the article wasinaccurate in matters of fact and misleading in its treatment of the story;it was also intended to convey, and succeeded in conveying, the impression that the Government were responsible for introducing new invasions ofprivacy or for distorting existing procedures to this end. These imputationsare in no way borne out by the facts.
cannot rely on definitive interpretations of the sometimes ambiguous phrase^,in which &quot; D &quot; notices must occasionally and unavoidably be expressed; anmthat, in construing them, regard should be paid to the views of those concerned with the actual working of the system. This is clearly right.But the Radcliffe Committee goes on to point out that the Press have in thecourse of time placed a limited interpretation on the &quot; D &quot; notices in questionwhich inhibits their application to the activities involved. As regards the&quot; D&quot; notice of 27th April, 1956, the Radcliffe Committee points out inparagraph 53 of the Report that:&quot; Prima facie we should have said that interception of cables in theway that we have described was clearly a form of &apos; secret intelligenceor counter-intelligence methods and activities in the United Kingdom &apos; the very phrase used in the notice of April, 1956. It is difficult to see,from a mere reading of the words, how they can fair to be apt for thepresent purpose. ...&quot;The difficulty is, however, the interpretation which, as the RadcliffeCommittee states, had come to be placed on this &quot; D &quot; notice by the Press.The passage (paragraph 56) in the Report is as follows &quot; The impression that we have formed is that the notice has by now come to be interpreted in this limited sense. It is not an unfair one,taking the wording as it stands. But we are bound to say that, if thatis all that it is intended to mean, its purport could have been, and could now be, expressed in much simpler and shorter words. Indeed, we were left by our witnesses in very considerable uncertainty whether,according to this interpretation, there is any such thing today as a secretintelligence method.&quot;This passage reflects the Radcliffe Committee&apos;s views that this interpretation of the &quot; D &quot; notice rendered it virtually meaningless and it is their conclusionthat &quot; some wider restriction &quot; would be justified. While it is accepted thatthe limited interpretation reflected the view taken by many newspapers, thePress are only one side of &quot;... those concerned with the actual working ofthe system.&quot; The Government, for their part, cannot accept thisconstruction which, as the Radcliffe Committee acknowledges, would render it meaningless.24. The Government further take the view that the &quot; D &quot; notice of30th October, 1961, referring as it does, to the various methods usedin the interception of foreign communications for secret intelligence purposes &quot;applies to the article in question.25. The difficulty is that to establish the applicability of these &quot; D &quot;notices beyond doubt, it is necessary to have a full knowledge of the activitiesinvolved. It has, however, always been accepted that the &quot; D &quot; notice system is based on voluntary co-operation. As the Committee which in 1962reported on &quot; Security Procedures in the Public Service&quot; put it:&quot; The &apos; D&apos; notice system therefore operates by arrangement betweenthe newspapers on the one side and the Government Departmentsconcerned with the protection of defence information on the other. its success depends upon goodwill and, in effect, upon very little else.&quot;
has also always been accepted that newspapers cannot be expected toterpret &quot; D&quot; notices without assistance. This must be so since, by thenature of the matter, it is not always possible to disclose the full background tothe incident or activities covered by a &quot; D &quot; notice. The present incident is an example of this. The view of all those concerned on the Government side with the actual working of the system and in full knowledge of the activities in question, is that the &quot; D &quot; notices do apply, and always have applied, tothe activities now at issue. Thus, when speaking as he did to the House ofCommons on 21st February, the Prime Minister was expressing the clear and unanimous conviction of all those who carry responsibility in thesematters that the Daily Express article in question was a breach of &quot; D&quot;notices. The Government appreciate the reasons, deriving to a considerable extent from the interpretation placed by the Press on the relevant &quot; D&quot;notices, which led the Radcliffe Committee to find in the contrary sense.But having further reviewed the matter in the light of the Report and having taken all the advice available to them, the Government remain of the view thatthe article was one which fell within the ambit of the &quot;D&quot; notices; andthey regard this view as consistent with the Committee&apos;s own finding that&quot; some wider restriction &quot; would be justified.Observance of the &quot; D &quot; notice procedure26. The third issue to which the Radcliffe Committee gave its attention was: &quot; Is it (the article in question) contrary to anything that can be called the procedure or conventions of the &apos; D&apos; notice system?&quot; The government accept that the editorial decision to publish the article was taken with nodeliberate intention of evading or defying &quot; D&quot; notice procedure orconventions since the editor, according to his evidence, was not made aware,in time to be of value, of the official view that publication would involvea breach of &quot; D &quot; notices. It is regrettable that this was so. The fact thathe was never so informed suggests not so much a defect in the system as a failure on both sides to operate it properly. Moreover, even when it is established in any particular case that &quot; D &quot; notices do not apply, it is stilla matter for editorial decision whether there should be publication. Nodoubt, an editor would in such circumstances take into account whether itis, in his view, right and in the public interest to publish and since, inmatters bearing on national security, he will seldom be in full possession ofthe facts, he would be wise to take official advice but it would be no breach of a &quot; D &quot; notice procedure or conventions if he were to decide in thesecircumstances to publish. This does not, of course, mean that it would necessarily be in the public interest to do so. The reaction of the editor ofthe Daily Mail, as described in paragraph 36 of the Report, is significantin this connection.IV.   IMPROVEMENTS TO THE &quot; D &quot; NOTICE system the &quot; D &quot; notices in the present case27. It appears from the Report that there are incompatible views onthe interpretations of the &quot; D&quot; notices in question. It is of the utmost importance that any ambiguity in these &quot; D&quot; notices, whether it arises
from the drafting of the &quot; D &quot; notices themselves or from any interpretatknw which may have been placed on them in the course of time, should bra!removed.   In paragraph 57 of the Report, the Committee remarks that:\ .&quot; It is possible that its (i.e., the &apos; D&apos; notice of April 1956) currentoperation gives less protection to intelligence methods and activities thanthe agencies responsible can fairly require. It is not altogether satisfactory to rely on silence only when the story touches &apos; particular cases and persons&apos;, because it is often impossible for those behind the scenes toknow in time whether the story they print does trench upon this restrictionor not. That requires a knowledge of the whole secret operation; andalthough, if he is alive to the possibility, an editor may be able toobtain assistance from prior consultation with the Secretary, it is too much to expect that in such cases the security services should be readyto pass out information as to what is really going on.&quot;28. The Government believe that if the &quot; D &quot; notice system is to have any meaning at all, it must afford protection to these activities which have long been a vital and integral part of the nation&apos;s security. Further, theGovernment attach the utmost importance to the Committee&apos;s view thatthere cannot, in the nature of things, be full disclosure of the facts of every case to the Press. The nation&apos;s secrets cannot be made public in this way and the very success over the years of the &quot; D &quot; notice system is a tribute tothe behaviour of a responsible Press in a free society.29. Any Government is, however, faced with a basic dilemma. On theone hand, it is impossible to draft all &quot; D &quot; notices in precise and specificterms without revealing far too many of the secrets which the system was designed to protect; &quot; D &quot; notices in precise terms could not, in any case,hope to give comprehensive coverage; and they might well requirestatutory reinforcement in the long run. This is not a situation whichanyone would welcome and the Government would deplore the necessityfor any movement towards stricter control. Indeed, for their part, theywould much prefer that the voluntary controls which have existed for so many years should be even less restrictive. But, on the other hand, &quot; D &quot;notices of a general nature can only give protection if there is completetrust on both sides. Under the present system, the Press must be preparedto accept official interpretations of the applicability of certain &quot; D &quot; noticesto particular cases, subject, of course, to the ultimate responsibility of aneditor to take the final decision. The Government, and their predecessors,have throughout recognised that a system based on voluntary self denialmakes great demands on the Press. They are, however, convinced that sucha system is viable: based on the essential element of mutual trust, it hasoperated efficiently over a long period of years. The present incident arosemainly out of a series of avoidable misunderstandings and the failure of the daily Express to inform the Secretary of its final decision to publish until it was too late for any effective further steps to be taken. In accordancewith the recommendation of the Committee, therefore, the Services, Press and broadcasting Committee will now be asked urgently to consider thedesirability of rewriting the &quot; D &quot; notice of 27th April, 1956, to clarify its application, bearing in mind the Committee&apos;s view that some widerrestriction would be justified.
iXhe &quot; D &quot; notice system in generalW 30. The Government welcome the conclusion of the Radcliffe Committeethat there is not much in the way of alteration that can usefully be recommended for the &quot; D&quot; notice system in general. The successful operation of this system over a period of many years is a remarkable fact.The system achieves two objects, both of which are vital to the health ofour society. On the one hand, it protects the rights and privileges of a freePress which, with the potent weapon at its command, must guard thepublic interest; and on the other, it pays proper regard to national security.It would be inimical to its effective operation to institutionalise it or tosuggest cumbersome arbitration procedures to deal with an entirelyexceptional case, such as the present incident, where, for a variety ofidentifiable reasons, the system failed to operate. Essentially the system isbased on the willingness of the Press to circumscribe its own freedom to publish and it could not survive without the voluntary co-operation of thePress which understandably might be withheld if the machinery became tooelaborate. The Report rightly stresses the dangers and practical difficultiesof introducing any &quot; stop&quot; procedure or any form of arbitration. TheGovernment, while accepting that these very real difficulties exist, intend todiscuss with the Press any changes of procedure involving a &quot; court ofappeal&quot; or any other arbitration machinery which might be acceptable to themselves and to the Press. They attach the greatest importance to maintaining and strengthening the &quot; D &quot; notice system and to retaining thefree and voluntary co-operation of the Press in its effective working. Fortheir part, they will do all in their power, consistently with their overridingresponsibility for national security, to contribute to this purpose.31. In the meantime, the Government have been considering what stepsthey could take to strengthen the system, consistently with the need not tooverburden it with unnecessary procedures. The Radcliffe Committee rightlypoints out that the Secretary of the Services, Press and broadcasting committee is the central figure in the working of the system and they makethree suggestions bearing upon his position.  Broadly these are:(a) that there should be a closer definition of his functions;(b) that he ought to have a deputy in his post; and(c) that efforts should be made to see that the Secretary is properlyinformed as to the facts that lie behind any &quot; D &quot; notice request.32. The need to define the functions of the Secretary is accepted by theGovernment as crucial since the series of misunderstandings in the present case arose partly because, as the Radcliffe Committee points out, there was never at any time any clear understanding between those speaking for theGovernment on one side and those speaking for the Daily Express on theother as to whether the issue between them was the observance of &quot; D &quot;notices or a question of non-publication on grounds of the general publicinterest. The Secretary&apos;s function is to act on behalf of his Committee andhis brief from officials on this occasion was to represent to the daily express that the publication of the proposed article would be a breach of&quot; D &quot; notices. The fact that he based his main case on wider argumentsmeant that he ceased to speak with the authority of his Committee. If inany particular case it is necessary to make an appeal on grounds of national
interest and such an appeal would only be made in exceptional cases okextreme gravity it is right that Ministers should decide who should act awspokesman on their behalf and the grounds on which any representationsshould be made. The Secretary is in no position to act as spokesman forthe Government since he thereby seriously prejudices his proper position inrelation to &quot; D &quot; notices without adding weight to any representations whichmay be made. The Government, therefore, accept the Radcliffe Committee&apos;recommendation that the Secretary should henceforward act only inaccordance with the instructions of his Committee, managing andinterpreting its decisions. He will now be instructed, in accordance withthe recommendations of the Radcliffe Committee, immediately to report allcases coming to him which lie at or beyond the borderline of the &quot; D &quot;notice system to his Chairman (or his deputy) who can then considerwhether Ministers should be informed or what other action should betaken.33. The Government accept that the Secretary should have a deputy and suitable supporting staff. A review of the post will be carried out to determine precisely what staff is required.34. The Government also accept, and attach great importance to, therecommendation of the Radcliffe Committee that effort should be made tosee that the Secretary is properly informed as to the facts that lie behindany &quot; D &quot; notice. The Secretary&apos;s position and his effectiveness rely on theconfidence and trust with which he is regarded by the Press. In view of thenecessarily general nature of a number of the &quot; D &quot; notices, the Press willnot always be able to judge for themselves whether a particular story fallsunder a &quot; D &quot; notice. It is, therefore, an essential part of the system thatthe Secretary should, as recommended by the Radcliffe Committee, have fulland unfettered access to secret information and that the Press, knowing this,should trust his judgment on the applicability of any particular &quot; D &quot; notices.It is the practice that officials who have regular and constant access to information of a highly secret nature are required to go through certainsecurity procedures.35. The post of Secretary of the Services, Press and broadcasting committee has not in the past been regarded as one whose occupant wouldbe required to undergo these procedures. Before this incident occurred,however, the Government were reviewing whether, in view of the very specialcircumstances of this post, this was right. The Government are now satisfiedthat the primary consideration is that there should be no impediment of any kind which may prevent the Secretary from having access to full information on any matters relating to &quot; D &quot; notices and the Secretary will henceforwardbe required to go through these procedures so that he can properly beinformed of secret material of the most sensitive nature.36. The Government have also considered, and accept, the other recommendations of the Radcliffe Committee on possible improvements tothe &quot; D &quot; notice system.   These are -(a) that the Chairman of the Services, Press and Broadcasting Committeeshould, as appropriate, ask his colleague on the Committee, theSecond Permanent Under-Secretary of State, to act as his deputy towhom the Secretary can report.
(b) that representation on the Services, Press and Broadcasting Committeeshould be altered so as to include other Departments which have not hitherto been represented on that Committee and that, to enable this to be done without altering the balance of representation on theCommittee, two of the three Second Permanent Under-Secretaries ofState should cease to be members. The Government also accept that,subject to the agreement of the Services, Press and broadcasting committee itself, representatives from the Home Office and ForeignOffice should be added to the membership of the Committee.The &quot; Spectator &quot;37. The Government agree with the views in the Report on the matterof the publication by the Spectator in its issue on 3rd March of two&quot;D&quot; notices.3Si379R0   Dd. 134490   K40  0/67
Reportof the Committee of Privy Counsellorsappointed to inquire into&apos; D&apos; notice matters
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF PRIVY COUNSELLORS 3To The Right Honourable Harold Wilson, O.B.E., M.P.We, the undersigned Privy Counsellors, were appointed &quot; to examinethe circumstances surrounding the publication of an article in the daily express of 21st February entitled, &apos; Cable Vetting Sensation&apos; in relation tothe &apos; D&apos; notice system ; and to consider what improvements, if any, arerequired in that system in order to maintain it as a voluntary system basedon mutual trust and confidence between the Government and Press in theinterests alike of the freedom of the Press and of the security of the State&quot;.We submit the following Report.2. The announcement of our appointment was made in your statement to the House of Commons on 28th February, 1967, and we held our firstmeeting in private on 9th March. We have since held 10 further meetings forthe hearing of oral evidence and for the purposes of our own discussions.3. The first part of our enquiry, that relating to the circumstances surround-ing the publication of the Daily Express article of 21st February, appearedto involve certain conflicts of evidence as to what had passed between representatives of that newspaper on the one hand and representatives ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government on the other. Accordingly we acceded to therequest of the Daily Express that they should be represented by Counsel(Sir Peter Rawlinson, Q.C., and Mr. Brian Neill) when their witnesses were giving evidence and when other witnesses, whose evidence related to thisconflict, were before us. The Editor and other representatives of the daily mail, who also gave evidence before us, were represented by Counsel, Mr.D. Hirst, Q.C. Apart from this we sat throughout in private during thecourse of our enquiry.4. The list of witnesses who gave evidence is set out in Appendix I to thisReport.Part IThe &apos; D&apos; Notice System5. An account of the history of &apos; D&apos; notices and of the system then pre-vailing with regard to their operation was set out in Chapter 9 of the white paper &quot; Security Procedures in the Public Service &quot; which was presented toParliament in April, 1962 (Cmnd. 1681). Subject to one or two minor alterations, the system there described is recognised as having continuedunchanged to the present day and we do not think it necessary to repeat the body of that account; for convenience, however, a brief summary of thesystem, including the minor changes which have been made since 1962, isgiven below.6. A &apos; D&apos; notice is a formal letter of warning or request, signed by theSecretary of a Committee known as the Services, Press and broadcasting committee, and addressed to newspaper editors, to news editors in sound broadcasting and television, to editors of some periodicals concerned with defence information and to selected publishers concerned with biographies
and historical and technical subjects. They are normally headed &quot; private and Confidential&quot; (or &quot; Secret&quot;) and are accepted by the recipients as con-fidential communications. Their purpose is to request a ban on the publica-tion of certain subjects, indicated in the notices, which bear upon defenceor national security. Sometimes they take the form of a simple requestedsuppression ; sometimes they identify certain subjects as areas of danger forthe purposes of security and suggest limits within which they can safely betreated.7. The &apos; D &apos; notice system is a voluntary one. There is no compulsion behind it, and non-observance of the request contained in a notice carries no penalties.The force of its appeal arises from the fact that it is put forward by somebranch of Her Majesty&apos;s Government which has reason to suppose that itsrequest is justified by the needs of security and that a notice cannot beissued unless its form and contents have been approved by the Committee,of whose members Press representatives are more than twice as numerousas the representatives drawn from Government Departments. Breaches ofthe terms of &apos; D &apos; notices do occur from time to time, but it seems to be agreedthat nearly every breach that has occurred has been attributable to inadver-tence, and a deliberate refusal to comply with a &apos; D&apos; notice is extremely rare.If it were otherwise, the system, which has worked effectively under what are substantially its present conditions since the end of the last War, would have long since broken down: for unless &apos;D&apos; notices are to be generally observedas a matter of obligation between each newspaper and the others as well asbetween all newspapers and the Government, it is obvious that single news-papers cannot be expected to continue to observe them when they are ignoredby other newspapers who may be in competition with them.8. The process that brings a &apos; D&apos; notice into existence is as follows. Theproposal will originate with one of the Government Departments concerned.A draft of what is required is then discussed with the Secretary of theCommittee. Not all proposals for &apos; D &apos; notices survive this discussion: some are withdrawn if the Secretary considers that they could not reasonably besubmitted to the Press. If one is to go forward, he advises on such detailedpoints as to its presentation as he thinks are likely to be of interest of his committee. A draft is then circulated among its members for their commentsand, if approved, it is issued by the Secretary in the name of the Committee asa whole. In cases of special urgency the Secretary is authorised to adopt anemergency procedure: he may send out a notice on his own responsibility,provided that he secures the prior approval of not less than three of the Pressmembers of the Committee, who must meet together for the purpose.9. The Secretary&apos;s office is therefore the central point of the system. He isthe servant of the Committee as a whole, and his duties are whole-time. Thegreater part of his daily work consists in offering advice and assistance to different members of the Press as to the interpretation and application of the&apos; D&apos; notices (of which there are to-day as many as 16 outstanding). Some-times a &apos;D&apos; notice can only be expressed as a general guide to editors onthe treatment of &quot; sensitive &quot; subjects, and we have no doubt that from timeto time questions of real difficulty arise as to the application of a particularnotice to some unpredictable combination of circumstances. It is on such questions in particular that the Secretary is invited to advise.  It must not be
thought that he is invested with any authority to give &quot; rulings &quot; or judicialinterpretations. The system is not institutionalised and it operates throughoutas one of free co-operation. But the evidence that we received satisfied us that, although individual editors vary from each other to some extent in theirattitude on this matter, the Secretary&apos;s interpretations of the meaning and effectof the notices are regarded with very great respect and would not be departedfrom by a particular newspaper until at any rate the matter had been fully discussed with him and a considered decision taken in the editorial chair.10. It may be that on special occasions the Secretary finds himself urgingwith respect to a particular piece of news that has suddenly broken that,whether or not it is covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice or even if it is not so covered,it is undesirable, unwise or unsafe that it should be published. It may be avery sensible thing to offer such advice in a particular context. But actionof this kind falls outside the &apos; D&apos; notice system. The considerations that givea peculiar weight to the impact of a &apos; D&apos; notice, such as we have alluded toabove, do not apply to such an appeal or request as this! It lies wholly within an editor&apos;s discretion whether he rejects it or accedes to it; and it could notbe otherwise under the regime of a free Press. We shall have to consider in what follows to what extent the Secretary&apos;s action in respect of the incidentthat we are enquiring into fell within or without the &apos; D&apos; notice system.11. For convenience of reference we set out in Appendix II the presentmembership of the Services, Press and Broadcasting Committee.Part II12. On Tuesday, 21st February, the Daily Express published the articleentitled &quot;Cable Vetting Sensation&quot; which is referred to in our Terms ofReference. It ran as follows:.-&quot; Cable Vetting SensationSecurity check on private messagesout of britain with telephone-tapping in the news-a new controversy whichwill be a parliamentary flash-point is revealed today . . .by Chapman PincherThousands of private cables and telegrams sent out of Britain fromthe Post Office or from commercial cable companies are regularly beingmade available to the security authorities for scrutiny.This &apos; Big Brother&apos; intrusion into privacy, which ranks with telephone-tapping and the opening of letters, was disclosed last night.&apos; It is certain to lead to a flood of questions in Parliament where a Billto prevent unauthorised telephone-tapping was given its first readingyesterday.The check can be applied to all cables and telegrams sent or received;   from abroad whether by individuals, companies or embassies.   Theembassies are allowed to send messages out in code but companies mayuse only accepted commercial codes.3
Passed onThere is no hold-up or censorship of the cables. But on the morningafter they have been sent or received they are collected and sifted by a post Office department concerned with security.Then any cables believed to be of special interest are passed to theSecurity Services.They are studied there, copied if necessary, and returned tothe Post Office and cable offices after being held for 48 hours.Most of the original cables and telegrams go out through the PostOffice, which owns the former Cable and Wireless Company. Cablespassed through private companies mainly branches of foreign concernsoperating in Britain are collected in vans or cars each morning and taken to the Post Office security department.The probe is conducted under a special warrant, signed by a Secretaryof State under Section 4 of the Official Secrets Acts and regularlyrenewed to keep it valid.In advance?Its purpose is to provide Intelligence for the security, military, and criminal investigation departments. A regular check on cables mayreveal the activities of persons or organisations suspected of operating against the national interest.But while the cables are being vetted, there is nothing toprevent information being passed to the Exchequer, the Board ofTrade, or any other interested department.This could provide the Government with advance information of confidential trade negotiations and other private deals.It has not been possible to establish when this routine cable probewas first introduced, but I understand that it has been in operation for several years.FOOTNOTE: An &apos; anti-tapping&apos; Bill introduced into the Commonsyesterday was sponsored by Mr. Peter Bessell, Liberal M.P. for Bodmin.&quot;13. It appears to us that we have three principal issues to resolve underthe first head of our Terms of Reference. We set them out:(1) Is this article an inaccurate account of the &apos;facts with which itpurports to deal?(2) Is it a breach of any one or more of the &apos; D &apos; notices?(3) Is it contrary to anything that can be called the procedure orconventions of the &apos; D &apos; notice system?We derive these issues, as we have formulated them, from the criticisms of the Daily Express article which were made in the House of commons by the Prime Minister during the week beginning 20th February, inconsequence of which we were constituted a Committee for the purpose ofreporting on the matter.
Is the Daily Express article of 2lst February an inaccurate account of thefacts with which it purports to deal?14. In order to arrive at an answer to the first of these questions, it wasnecessary for us to make some enquiry as to the practice of scrutinisingcables under Government authority to which the article alludes. In ourview, our Terms of Reference neither require nor invite us to weigh the reasons of State upon which the practice is founded or to examine in any detail the purposes to which and the limits within which it is confined. Basically,such scrutiny forms a secret operation and, being so, we do not proposeto say more about it than the minimum that is necessary to found our findingon the first issue that we have set out above.15. The practice involved is variously described as scrutiny, as vettingor as interception. In our language all these terms mean the same thing.It does not involve any stopping of cable transmissions or any interferencewith the normal speed of their onward transmission. It does involve a regular collection of copies of messages transmitted by the Post Office andother cable offices with a view to the total collected being sorted andcertain defined categories of them being set aside for inspection by the intelligence agents of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.16. The practice is authorised in law by section 4 of the Official secrets act, 1920, which empowers a Secretary of State by warrant to require oftransmitting companies the production as he directs of the originals orcopies of all telegrams tendered for transmission to or arriving by thetelegraphs of each company concerned. According to the information givento us, this power has been regularly exercised against transmitting companiessince the coming into operation of the Act. No new practice has been introduced in recent years which departs from the practices previouslyobserved. We have ascertained that the instructions that determine whichtelegrams are to be put aside by the sorters for inspection are directed tothe interests of security and of certain wider intelligence purposes which concern this country&apos;s international relations. In fact, only a small percentageof the total telegrams handled is put aside in this way.17. We do not think that we should say more than this in our Report; butwe have set out for your information in a special Annex, which is not intended for publication, a summary account of the range and objectives ofthe current practice of interception.18. It is not necessary to say whether the Daily Express article wasaccurate in all points of detail. It was not inaccurate in any sense that couldexpose it to hostile criticism on that score.The second and third issues19. We now pass to a consideration of the second and third issues that wehave set out. That requires that we should put on record the &apos; D&apos; noticeswhich are in question it is not suggested that there are more than twoof them and assemble a short narrative of the events that are material to the impugned publication.5
20. The two &apos;D&apos; notices run as follows, omitting those parts of themthat do not bear on the present issue. .(a) &apos;D&apos; Notice-27A.56   .&quot; Dear Sir,In view of the publicity given by recent events to the operations of our Security Organisation, the Services, Press and broadcasting committee feel that you would welcome clarification and co-ordinationof the requests made to you in D Notice dated 28.11.45 and inmy Private and Confidential Letters dated 28.12.50 and 31.7.53.In requesting secrecy on the items listed below, I would emphasise that they refer to two branches of the British Intelligence Services M.I.5.....and M.I.6..... The reasons for the requests made,in so far as I am permitted to give them to you, will be found inthe appendix to this letter.Will you please in the national interest make no reference to thefollowing:(i) Secret intelligence or counter intelligence methods and activities in or outside the United Kingdom.In conclusion may I ask you to bear in mind that the task of the intelligence Services in a democratic country is far from easy andearnestly request you, when in doubt, to act on the principle thatas little publicity as possible should be given to their activities?Yours faithfully,George P. Thomson (Signed),Secretary of the Committee.&apos;D&apos; notice 28.11.45 and Private and Confidential Letters 28.12.50 and31.7.53, which are embodied in this &apos; D &apos; notice, should now be regardedas cancelled, and destroyed.Appendix to &apos;D&apos; notice 27.4.56Note to (z) Certain methods employed in Intelligence work areto some extent a matter of common knowledge and itis thus understandable that editors would not normallyregard them as secret methods. Published reference,however, to what may seem to Be obvious methods of counter espionage work, when related to particular cases or persons, create an awareness and vigilancein the minds of agents which may well enable themto circumvent the precautions taken to deal with them.Such references do serious harm in assisting a foreignIntelligence organisation to build up a picture on thebasis of which it conducts its operations, both offensive and defensive.&quot;(b) &apos; D&apos; notice-30.10.61&quot; Note: (This &apos; D &apos; notice modifies and supersedes the request madeto you in &apos; D &apos; notice 15.10.58).   .
The Services, Press and Broadcasting Committee request that inthe interest of national security you will make, no reference to thefollowing:  (2) The various methods used in the interception of foreign com-munications for secret intelligence purposes. In this connection the Committee request that you will not refer to the fact thaton occasions it is necessary in the interest of defence for theServices to intercept such communications.Yours faithfully,George Thomson (Signed)Secretary of the Committee &quot;The narrative21. The story began, as far as the Daily Express was concerned, at 3 p.m.on Thursday, 16th February, when, by appointment, a Mr. Robert Lawsoncame to the office of Mr. Pincher, its defence correspondent. According toMr. Pincher, Mr. Lawson said that he had worked in two cable offices,Commercial Cables and Western Union, as a telegraphist and had discoveredthat all cables and overseas telegrams sent from, and received by, these offices were collected daily by a Ministry of Public Building and Works vanand taken to the Ministry of Defence in the old Admiralty building. he also believed that all overseas cables and telegrams handled by all othercable offices and by the Post Office were treated in the same way. Accordingto his information, the cables and telegrams were held in the Admiraltybuilding for 48 hours and were then returned to the Post Office and the cable companies. His enquiries showed that this had been routine practice for at least two years and possibly longer. Mr. Pincher said that it was his understanding that it would be normal practice in any country for thesecurity authorities to intercept cables coming to, or issuing from, a person under suspicion as a spy; he was not, however, aware that all cables werebeing made available for vetting as a continuing process. Mr. Lawson saidthat he had previously given information on this, matter to the Daily Mailand had also informed a University of London Union magazine called Sennet.22. Mr. Pincher decided to make further enquiries into the story andtelephoned to the Public Relations Branch of the Ministry of Defence toask whether there was anything in it. The Daily Mail had already asked the Branch about the story and, after consultation within the Department,had been told that there was nothing in it. Mr. Pincher was also told this.He then got in touch with the Public Relations Branch of the Post Officeand was told by its Director (in confidence and not for publication) that therewas some substance in the story but that some, not all, cables were thesubject of collection. The Director told us that he regarded this as something that was perfectly well known.
23. Mr. Pincher then telephoned Colonel Lohan, the Secretary of theServices, Press and Broadcasting Committee. He told Colonel Lohan aboutthe story which Mr. Lawson had given him. There is some disagreementwhether the story as he related it to Colonel Lohan referred to Post office telegrams alone or to all cables. However this may be, Colonel Lohan saw no significance in the story as it was put to him and replied to Mr. Pincherthat there was no &apos; D&apos; notice that applied to such a story. Colonel Lohanwas not aware that Mr. Pincher had already been in touch with the public relations Branches of the Ministry of Defence and the Post Office, and it isColonel Lohan&apos;s recollection although Mr. Pincher was not able to confirmthis that he advised Mr. Pincher to put his story to the Ministry of defence and then to discuss it further with him.24. In the course of the next day Colonel Lohan was made aware thatthe Foreign Office and the security authorities viewed with very great concern the idea of such a story appearing in the public Press. News of this possi-bility had reached them by various, channels, and he was asked to take immediate steps to secure the agreement of the newspapers who were inpossession of the story that it should be withheld from publication. Telephoneconversations between him and Mr. Pincher of the Daily Express and the managing Editor of the Daily Mail ensured that no publication would takeplace in either newspaper until at any rate after the week-end.25. On the afternoon of the same day a meeting was arranged at theForeign Office under the chairmanship of a Foreign Office official at whichthere were present representatives of the Government Departments concerned and the security authorities. The purpose of this meeting was to discussthe handling of the news story that was threatening to break and to decide on the steps to be taken to deal with it. It was the general view that the story touched upon secret intelligence operations and that, as such, it came within the restrictions requested by the two &apos; D&apos; notices of 27th April, 1956and 30th October, 1961. It was decided, therefore, that Colonel Lohanshould be approached and asked to do all that he could to ensure the suppression of the story by invoking the cover of the &apos; D&apos; notices.26. Colonel Lohan was not invited to be present at this meeting. This initself argues some defect in procedure. If he was going to be relied upon as the instrument to set in motion the &apos; D&apos; notice system for the banningof this story, he ought to have been present at this critical discussion andhave heard what passed between those concerned on the Government side.Had he been there, they might have learnt from him, as they never did, the doubts which, as we have learnt from his evidence, he entertained from thefirst as to the likelihood of persuading the newspapers concerned that thetwo &apos; D&apos; notices in question ought to be interpreted as applying to the case.27. What happened in fact was that the Foreign Office representative,anxious to make sure that Colonel Lohan was properly briefed as to theofficial attitude, spoke to him on the telephone on two occasions, on Saturday,18th February and on the morning of Monday, the 20th. The upshot ofwhat Colonel Lohan was asked to do in his approaches to the press can besummarised as follows. He was to try to get the story stopped &quot;on &apos; D&apos;notice grounds &quot; by referring to one or both of the two notices, but hewas to say as little as possible about the actual operations that were in
question and to avoid any enlargement upon the fact that they were intelli-gence operations. It was hoped that he would be able to satisfy Mr. Pincherby assuring him that the activities fell under &apos; D&apos; notices and involved the&quot; defence of the realm &quot; or &quot; national security &quot;.28. We have no doubt that Colonel Lohan accepted these instructions as con-veyed to him on the telephone. He did not make it plain to the Foreign office that, from his experience of the working of the &apos;D&apos; notice system with regard tothese particular notices, he had grave doubts whether he would be able to bringthe story under them. He thought that he had sufficient influence with Mr.Pincher to be able to persuade him on general grounds of national interest that the story was one which ought not to be published, whether or not the(&apos; D&apos; notices were so worded as by their own force to make a case forsuppression. There was thus, by the morning of 20th February, a crossingof purposes between the official side and the Secretary of the Services, press and Broadcasting Committee, the former supposing that the necessary actiondepended upon a simple appeal to &apos; D &apos; notices, masked by a prudent reticenceas to what it was all about, the latter having in mind that, if he was goingto succeed at all in the task of suppression, it would be by deployment ofhis powers of persuasion, not by fortifying himself behind the wording ofany &apos; D &apos; notices.29. The misunderstanding was unfortunate, because it led to some dividedcounsels later. On the other hand it is impossible to say with any confidence that, even if it had been cleared up at the time, the final result of the intendedapproach to Mr. Pincher would have been any different. Mr. Pincher, as appears from what we say later, was very clearly determined in his ownmind that the &apos; D&apos; notices, in their accepted interpretation, did not cover hisstory. Moreover it must be said for Colonel Lohan, who failed in his mission, that the highly restricted line of argument urged upon him by theForeign Office left him with very little effective material for a successfulapproach. For if he was to rely on either the &apos; D&apos; notice of April, 1956 or that of October, 1961, he had at least to show that what the story dealtwith was a method of secret intelligence ; and he could hardly do that withany force if he was to make as little as possible of the intelligence aspect of the matter. Further, general phrases such as &quot; the defence of the realm &quot;or &quot; the security of the nation&quot; are not in themselves calculated to have much impact upon the mind of an experienced defence correspondent, whohas probably become accustomed to look for rather more concrete arguments on the difficult questions of what he ought and what he ought not to writefor publication.30. Colonel Lohan and Mr. Pincher finally arranged to meet to discussthe whole matter at lunch at a London restaurant on Monday, 20th February.The suggestion that the meeting should take place over lunch was made byMr. Pincher, since Colonel Lohan was engaged during the morning and Mr.Pincher himself had an appointment in the afternoon. We do not think thatthe selection of a lunch meeting in a public restaurant was a wise choicefor an occasion of this nature, which was urgent, important and dealt with matters of some secrecy. On the other hand, the men were friendswho had had working contacts for years, and no doubt the appointment seemedto them a natural enough arrangement.
31. There is a conflict of evidence about some parts of the discussion thattook place during the lunch, which extended over a period of nearly two hours. Having heard the evidence both of Colonel Lohan and Mr. Pincher,we think that the substance of the matter can be set down as follows. Thediscussion opened with a reference to the cable vetting story, and colonel lohan produced copies of the two &apos; D&apos; notices from his inside pocket. Mr.Pincher at once insisted that they could not possibly be applied, his mainline of argument, it seems, being that the opening of letters and the tapping oftelephones had long been accepted as not being secret intelligence methods inthis context, and the scrutiny of cables came exactly within the same principle.Colonel Lohan at no time made any explicit admission that he accepted the argument and that the story could be treated as unaffected by &apos; D&apos; notices,but there is no doubt that after some time, the discussion being at a deadlock,he put the copies of the two notices away, with the words &quot; All right, let usput that aside and argue even more generally on why you should not publish the story.&quot;32. The discussion then passed away from the question whether the &apos; D&apos;notices applied, Colonel Lohan directing his arguments to Mr. Pincher to thedesirability of suppressing the story on grounds of its damage to the national interest. He spoke, as Mr. Pincher understood, absolutely in confidence and gave some practical examples of the aid that cable vetting could give todetection of subversive activities by the security service. It was, he said, afruitful source of security intelligence a point to which public attention hasalready been drawn by the 1957 Birkett Report dealing with letters, telegrams and telephones. He did not rely on any suggestion that a particular securityoperation was then in hand. The Press, as we understand it, are habituallyresponsive to an appeal on those grounds. While Mr. Pincher conceded thatthe interception of cables might provide useful information, he vehementlyexpressed his view that the routine availability of private cables to the securityauthorities was an unacceptable invasion of privacy. There was no mis-understanding between the two men that Colonel Lohan was making an urgent appeal on behalf of the Government for the suppression of the story.33. At the end of the lunch Mr. Chapman Pincher promised to report&quot; quitefairly &quot; Colonel Lohan&apos;s request to his editor, but at the same time he made it clear that it was his view that suppression would be wrong and that if hewas the editor he would print. He promised to let Colonel Lohan know theresult of his talk with his editor.34. Colonel Lohan left the restaurant to pay his call at the offices of the daily Mail who, it will be remembered, had been holding over their version of the cable vetting story, at his request, since the previous Friday, when hehad spoken to Mr. Matthewman, the Managing Editor. An interview tookplace between him and Mr. Matthewman and the paper&apos;s defence corre-correspondent, Mr. Angus Macpherson. The account of what passed at this meetingis of some assistance in throwing light on the vexed question whether Mr.Pincher was entitled to assume, as he certainly did assume, after the luncheondiscussion with Colonel Lohan, that the latter himself was not treating theuse of his story as one falling within a &apos; D&apos; notice ban. Neither Mr.Matthewman nor Mr. Macpherson received the impression at (the interview
that Colonel Lohan had come to them to ask them to observe the terms ofany particular &apos; D&apos; notice. According to Mr. Matthewman, Colonel Lohanopened the interview by saying, &quot; There are as a matter of fact a coupleof &apos; D&apos; notices which could be said to affect this particular story. However,this conversation is not on the basis of &apos; D &apos; notices.&quot; The &apos; D&apos; notices were notin fact looked at in the course of the interview. Mr. Macpherson&apos;s recollectionwas to the same effect: &quot; I am not relying on &apos; D &apos; notices.&quot;35. We feel bound to conclude from this that Colonel Lohan did notmanage to convey to those he spoke to on the afternoon of Monday, 20thFebruary, either Mr. Pincher or Mr. Matthewman or Mr. Macpherson, thathe himself regarded the cable vetting story as a &apos; D&apos; notice matter.36. His general line of approach to the Daily Mail, however, provedeffective. He did, inadvertently, give the impression, in answer to a query,that publication would be likely to prejudice a particular security operationthen current. This weighed with Mr. Matthewman and the Editor, Mr.Brittenden, who was brought into consultation after Colonel Lohan had left,but the general basis of the decision they arrived at, not to use the story,seems to have been that an approach of this kind from the Secretary of theServices, Press and Broadcasting Committee asking for non-publication on thegrounds of national security ought to be treated as equivalent to a &apos; D&apos; notice and observed accordingly. Not all members of the Press, we gathered fromother evidence, would accept such a principle as sound doctrine. And thereare obvious difficulties involved in treating it as a general principle of anybinding force.37. Colonel Lohan left the Daily Mail offices with a firm confidence thatthey were not going to use the story, if other papers did not. He gave them the assurance, &quot; Look, one thing is due to you. I do not think the Expresswill publish, but if they do publish I shall be honour bound to let you know.&quot; Somewhere about this time, he passed a telephone message to theForeign Office that he thought that the situation was &quot; under control&quot; andthat, if the Express did decide to publish, the Government would havewarning and a further chance of intervention.Editorial conference at the Daily Express38. After the luncheon Mr. Pincher returned to the offices of the daily Express and at about 5.45 p.m. visited the Editor, Mr. Derek Marks,and told him about the story. This was the first occasion, Mr. Marks told us, on which he had heard anything about it. Mr. Marks himself had previous experience as a defence correspondent, and he had in any event the editorialresponsibility of deciding whether to print or not. The question of the&apos; D&apos; notices soon arose between him and Mr. Pincher, and the latter gavehim a categorical assurance that they did not apply. He spoke of his recentdiscussion with Colonel Lohan and explained that Colonel Lohan had brought to it all the relevant &apos; D&apos; notices and had said that none of themapplied. The situation, as he explained it, was similar to that of storiesabout telephone tapping, as to which the &apos; D&apos; notice practice was that, whileindividual instances of tapping ought not to be referred to (as being&quot; operational&quot;), it was perfectly permissible to write about the practice asa whole.   Mr. Pincher added that Colonel Lohan had said to him that,
while he agreed that there was no &apos; D&apos; notice on the story, he was under&quot; very strong pressure to persuade us &quot; not to use the story. Mr. Marks tooknotice of that request and asked Mr. Pincher to put his siory in writing and bring it back so that it could be fully considered. This was done.39. A meeting was then called, which was attended by the Legal Manager,Mr. Andrew Edwards, the Managing Director, Mr. Eric Raybould, and the night Editor, Mr. Peter Johnson. At this meeting Mr. Pincher repeatedhis assurance that Colonel Lohan had agreed that the story was not covered by&apos; D&apos; notices. Mr. Edwards drew attention to the power in section 4 of theOfficial Secrets Act, 1920 to intercept cables ; Mr. Marks thereupon asked mr. Pincher to incorporate a reference to that section in his story. when that had been done the story was re-examined and the Editor decided notto withhold publication. He told us that, in reaching this decision, he hadin mind the fact that the legal power of interception was public knowledge,that Mr. Pincher had assured him that Colonel Lohan had advised that nobreach of a &apos; D&apos; notice was involved and that, although the story had beenunder discussion with the authorities since Thursday of the previous week andwas known to be in the hands of the Daily Mail as well, no action had beentaken to issue a notice by way of &quot; overriding caveat &quot;.40. After the editorial conference Mr. Pincher telephoned Colonel Lohan.This was about 6.30 p.m. What he said was that he had written his story,taken it to his Editor and told him about Colonel Lohan&apos;s request to with-hold publication. He did not tell Colonel Lohan at this time that the editor had already decided in favour of publication. If he had done so,the time-table of further official action to get the story suppressed would havebeen advanced by several very important hours. Mr. Pincher told us that what he said at 6.30 p.m. was &quot; I cannot be sure we are printing until8.15 &quot; and that the reason why he did not say something to the effect thathe thought that the Editor was going to print was that, if he did so, colonel lohan would be bound to ring up the Daily Mail and release their cable vetting story, while if some news of special importance came into the express office in the course of the next hour or two they might not beprinting their story that night after all. Accordingly he said that he wouldtelephone him again if they did decide to print that night. Mr. Pincher,in our view, was being more cautious at this point than his dealings with colonel Lohan justified. He could fairly have told him that the Editorwas not accepting his request, but have asked him not to take any action with the Mail until it was quite certain that the Express was goingto publish that night. But he did not. Colonel Lohan was thus left withthe impression that the issue of publication was still open, and at about p.m. he reported to this effect to Sir James Dunnett, the Chairman of theServices, Press and Broadcasting Committee. The words that he used inmaking his report reflect his assessment of the position: &quot; I am skating on very thin ice ; nevertheless I think I am holding it.&quot;41. After reporting his conversation to Sir James, Colonel Lohan made arrangements for his assistant to remain in the office in case any telephone callcame through, and he then caught the 7.49 p.m. train from Victoria toCharing and reached home soon after 9.10 p.m. At about 9.30 p.m. Mr.Pincher, having learnt from his Night Editor that his story was going
in that night as a lead, telephoned to Colonel Lohan to say that the storywas in fact being published. Both agree that he used some such words as&quot; You have lost&quot;.42. Colonel Lohan immediately telephoned the Daily Express office and ask to speak to the Editor, Mr. Derek Marks. Since he was not availablehe spoke to the Night Editor, Mr. Peter Johnson, who said that he hadno authority to stop the story and that Glasgow had gone to press.Colonel Lohan asked for a message to be left for Mr. Marks to get intouch with him as soon as possible, and he arranged for a message to be passed at once to the Foreign Office informing them of the development and that the cable vetting story was already appearing in the Glasgowedition of the Daily Express.43. Hitherto the only person who had made approaches to put theGovernment^ point of view was Colonel Lohan, and the only personwith whom he had had contact on the side of the Daily Express was mr. Pincher. During the course of the next two hours there were separateinterventions from the Government side, made by the Foreign secretary and Mr. W. L. Greig, his press adviser, respectively. The Foreign Secretaryspoke to Sir Max Aitken and Mr. Greig to Mr. Marks. We shall haveto follow out these exchanges in a little detail in order to give a sufficientaccount of the circumstances attending the publication of the article.Intervention of Foreign Secretary and Mr. Greig44. The Foreign Secretary had been informed by his Department onFriday, 17th February, that a story on cable vetting was in the hands ofthe Daily Express and some other papers, and on the afternoon of Monday,20th February he had learnt that Colonel Lohan had reported, after hislunch with Mr. Pincher, that he regarded the situation as under control,that he thought that the Express were not going to publish and that ifthey decided to do so &quot; we should have another opportunity&quot;. TheForeign Secretary decided on the basis of that information that he wouldnot try to make a personal intervention at that stage.45. At about 10 oblock on that evening the Foreign Secretary wasdining at the house of a friend and there received a telephone message from an official at the Foreign Office to the effect that the Daily Expressnow intended to publish the story and that it was running in the Glasgowedition of that paper. This was the purport of the message that colonel lohan had sent through to the Foreign Office. The Foreign Secretarythereupon decided to get in touch with Sir Max Aitken and to ask himto prevent the publication of the story. The Foreign Secretary rang upthe offices of the Daily Express and eventually was put through to Sir MaxAitken. Sir Max was at that time at a dinner being held at the GarrickClub and, unknown to the Foreign Secretary, the call was put through to the Garrick Club and was received by Sir Max, who had been calledfrom the dinner, in the porter&apos;s box in the hall of the club.46. The situation was one well calculated to produce misunderstandingson both sides. The Foreign Secretary was speaking on an open line andfor reasons of security was unable to make any detailed reference at all to the secret activities which he understood to form the basis of the
story. He was Under the impression that Sir Max knew about the storywhich was going to appear in his paper and about its contents. In fact,Sir Max did not at that time know anything about it at all and had noidea to what the Foreign Secretary was referring. There was a furthermisunderstanding. The Foreign Secretary gained the impression fromsomething that Sir Max said to the effect that Mr. Derek Marks was&quot; with him&quot; that Mr. Marks was actually by his side during the con-versation. In fact, Mr. Marks was at the dinner table in the GarrickClub which Sir Max had left in order to go to the telephone box, andSir Max meant to convey by his words no more than that Mr. Markswas readily at hand to carry out any action that might be required.47. The conversation was a very short one. In the circumstances itcould hardly have been anything else. The Foreign Secretary opened by saying &quot; Your papers are running a story which is under a &apos; D&apos; notice &quot;,and asking that it should be stopped. It was, he said, a dangerous storyfor public security. Sir Max, who did not know what he was talkingabout, answered that if there was a story covered by &apos; D &apos; notices he wouldcertainly have it taken out, or would &quot; kill it&quot;. He said that the Editorwas with him and he would speak to him immediately. There are twominor points upon which we cannot reconcile the respective versions ofthe conversation given to us by the Foreign Secretary and Sir Max. Theformer does not think that he referred to the Glasgow edition of the express as the source of the story. Sir Max thinks that he did. As we know that the story reached the Foreign Secretary from the Foreign office as a report about the Glasgow edition and as Sir Max&apos;s instructions tothe Express officials related to this we think that the Foreign Secretaryprobably did refer to Glasgow. Secondly, something was said by theForeign Secretary about the Express being given fuller information if theywould hold up the story. Sir Max understood that to mean that, if theywaited for 24 hours, they would get a better story for publication. TheForeign Secretary is clear that he meant only that the representatives ofthe paper could have fuller confidential information, by way of background,to explain the reasons that made it dangerous to publish the story. Weare sure that he intended to convey no more than this.48. The Foreign Secretary felt confident at the close of this brief conver-sation that Sir Max had undertaken to suppress the story. He made a note,&quot; I have talked to Max; he has agreed to kill the story &quot;. He passed thesame information back to the Foreign Office. Sir Max did not understand the matter in this way. He left the telephone, went back to the dinner andspoke to Mr. Marks. He told him that the Foreign Secretary had told him that a story which the Express were running in Glasgow came under a&apos; D&apos; notice and that he had told the Foreign Secretary that if that werethe case they would take it out. Mr. Marks left the dinner in order tomake further enquiries. It seems odd to us that, having regard to thediscussions in his office about the cable vetting story only an hour or two before, his mind did not at once turn to that story. But he explained tous that this was not so. He had been told by Mr. Pincher that it had been officially cleared under &apos; D &apos; notices, and the reference to the Glasgow editionmade him think that it must be some local story, perhaps dealing withPolaris, which was said to be infringing &apos;D&apos; notices.   So he got in touch
story. He was under the impression that Sir Max knew about the storywhich was going to appear in his paper and about its contents. In fact,Sir Max did not at that time know anything about it at all and had noidea to what the Foreign Secretary was referring. There was a furthermisunderstanding.

So he got in touch
with the Editor in Glasgow to see whether there was any story runningin their edition which might be in breach of a &apos;D&apos; notice. Having been assured that this was not so, he came to the conclusion that the foreign secretary must have been complaining of the cable vetting story itself.Mr. Marks reported this to Sir Max Aitken and assured him that, accordingto his understanding, this story had been cleared by Colonel Lohan. SirMax asked him to get in touch with the Foreign Secretary and to explain tohim what the real circumstances were. Accordingly Mr. Marks returned tohis office at about 10.45 p.m. and spoke to Mr. Peter Johnson, the NightEditor, who gave him an account of the telephone call that he had recently received from Colonel Lohan. Mr. Marks then rang up the Foreign office in order to speak to the Secretary of State. Meanwhile Mr. Greig, theForeign Secretary&apos;s special assistant on press matters, pursuing an independent enquiry, got in touch with Mr. Marks.49. We can now deal shortly with what passed between Mr. Greig andMr. Marks. We must make clear that we do not attach any importanceto this exchange. Mr. Greig was acting throughout as an intermediary forthe Foreign Secretary in sustaining the attitude that the latter had already taken up in his conversation with Sir Max Aitken. He had no personalknowledge of the story or the background situation that was responsiblefor the request for its suppression: he was not familiar with the &apos; D&apos;notices or their interpretation. He was, however, one of those on theGovernment side who approached the Express about the story.(a) Mr. Marks explained to Mr. Greig that they could find nothing inTuesday&apos;s Daily Express that contravened &apos; D &apos; notices. There was their cable vetting story, but they had been assured on good authority that this was not covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice. (We assume that Mr.Marks&apos; reference to &quot; good authority &quot; related to what Mr. Pincherhad told him of his conversation with Colonel Lohan.) He wantedthis explanation conveyed to the Foreign Secretary.(b) Mr. Greig telephoned the Foreign Secretary, who told him to impress on Mr. Marks that the story was covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice and that sir Max had promised to take it out. Mr. Greig passed this onto Mr. Marks.(c) Mr. Marks in reply rejected both these points. He denied that&apos; D&apos; notices applied: he denied any promise by Sir Max to kill the story. Mr. Greig passed this back to the Foreign Secretary. Hewas instructed to return to Mr. Marks again, repeating his previouspoints and complaining very vigorously that Sir Max was breakinghis word. On this occasion Mr. Greig quoted to Mr. Marks theidentifying dates of the two &apos; D&apos; notices in question, with whichhe had been supplied by the Foreign Secretary&apos;s private office. this occurred some time about midnight.(d) Mr. Marks&apos; final communication to Mr. Greig can be related in its place in the part of our narrative that follows.50. Between the hours of 9.30 p.m. on the 20th and 1 a.m. on the 21st,a great many telephone conversations took place between the various parties concerned.   They make a confusing narrative, since they tended to overlap
each other in time, and the speakers were not always aware of what was going on at the same time elsewhere. We therefore condense the accountinto the few short essential incidents.id) Colonel Lohan, on hearing that the Daily Express were running the cable vetting story in their Glasgow edition, telephoned to the daily mail saying that he could no longer ask them to hold the story. he felt bound to do this in view of the promise he had made to themearlier on the Monday afternoon (see paragraph 37).(b) Shortly afterwards Colonel Lohan heard, through the report madeby the Foreign Secretary to the Foreign Office (see paragraph 48),that Sir Max Aitken had promised to kill the story.(c) Colonel Lohan then returned to the Mail, asking them to hold their story after all, as he had just learnt that the Express were going to kill theirs. The Editor replied to him that this couldnot be so, since he had the first London edition of the Express in front of him and they were running the story. Colonel Lohan thenagreed, without further reservation, that the Mail were at liberty to print their story (subject to one alteration that he suggested), asthe whole story was now &quot; out&quot;.id) Mr. Marks then came through to Colonel Lohan on the telephonein accordance with the request that Colonel Lohan had previouslyleft at the Express office (see paragraph 42). Colonel Lohanreproached him with running a story in his London edition despite the promise made to the Foreign Secretary and despite the &apos; D&apos;notices. Mr. Marks repudiated both claims, saying that Mr. Pincherassured him that Colonel Lohan himself had stated the story not tobe under &apos; D&apos; notices.(e) Mr. Marks, disturbed by the messages from the Secretary of Statepassed to him by Mr. Greig and the protest of Colonel Lohan, tried to reach Sir Max and Mr. Pincher on the telephone. He could not get in touch with either. In his uncertainty he decided that his right course was to kill the story, even though it had appeared inthe first London edition. This decision was reached at about11.45 p.m.if) Mr. Marks then telephoned to Mr. Greig. He told him that he felt obliged in the circumstances to accept the view put forward on theauthority of the Foreign Secretary that his story contravened &apos; D&apos;notices and that he had given instructions to have it taken out of latereditions.ig) He then spoke to Colonel Lohan on the telephone (at about00.30 a.m.), told him that he was stopping the story, and added,&quot; I assume that everyone else is being stopped &quot;. Colonel Lohanreplied that this was impossible: to his knowledge The times and the Daily Mail were coming out with the story. He did notthink that taking the story out at such a late stage could do anygood.ih) In the light of this information Mr. Marks countermanded his instructions and decided to continue publishing the story. He so informed Mr. Greig.
Was there a breach of the &apos; D&apos; notices?51. This is the second issue that we have formulated above. We must say at once that this is not a question that allows of a simple answer basedon a mere reading of the words of the notices. The &apos; D&apos; notice system, aswe have said, is not institutionalised and probably it would not have survivedas an effective working system if attempts had ever been made to treat itas if it were. It does not allow for rulings or judicial interpretation as tothe authoritative meanings of the sometimes ambiguous phrases that &apos; D&apos;notices employ. It is necessary, therefore, to approach this question witha regard for the views of those concerned with the actual working of thesystem as to what the disputed notices permitted and what they forbade.52. Mr. Pincher, as we know, scouted the idea that they applied to hisstory. Colonel Lohan, as we learnt from him in his evidence to us, had verylittle confidence in their applicability. Indeed he regarded it as quiteinadmissible to say that the Daily Express article constituted any clearbreach of &apos; D&apos; notices: and it is plain that his conduct was on occasionconditioned by that view. Mr. L. J. Dicker, a Press representative on theServices, Press and Broadcasting Committee with long experience of its.working, told us in evidence that he thought the article too general in treatment to be a breach of &apos; D&apos; notices. Apart from this, Mr. MauriceGreen, the Editor of the Daily Telegraph, Mr. Lee Howard, the Editor of the daily Mirror, and Mr. Edward Pickering, the Editor of the Daily Expressfrom 1956 to 1961, all appeared before us to express their individual viewsthat the impugned article was not within the &apos; D&apos; notices, with which theywere familiar. On the other hand Mr. Brittenden and Mr. MacPherson, ofthe Daily Mail, told us that they would have taken a contrary view.53. Prima facie we should have said that interception of cables in the way that we have described was clearly a form of &quot; secret intelligence or counter-intelligence methods and activities in the United Kingdom &quot; the very phraseused in the notice of April, 1956. It is difficult to see, from a mere reading of the words, how they can fail to be apt for the present purpose. But it was brought home to us in our enquiry that the effective application of this noticewas not a straightforward matter. There had been previous debates as towhat it meant and how far it was intended to go. To quote Colonel Lohan:&quot; I have terrible difficulties with this wretched &apos; D&apos; notice that deals withmethods and activities, because people say it can mean anything and every-thing.&quot; In his view, once it has been conceded, as it had been by a specialnotice sent out after the publication of the Birkett Report, that telephone tapping was not a &quot; secret method &quot; protected by the &apos; D&apos; notice of April,1956, the argument that cable vetting remained protected was &quot; equallyuntenable &quot;.54. Mr. Pincher amplified this point to us in his evidence as to pastdiscussions of what &quot; secret methods &quot; were under this &apos; D&apos; notice. &quot; Thuson the face of it one might think, as this is done in secrecy, vetting cables,it counts as a secret method, but I have had many discussions with AdmiralThomson and Colonel Lohan, and it has always been agreed that telephone tapping or the opening of letters even though it is done in secrecy does not count as a secret method. Admiral Thomson told me on many occasions when have discussed the question of whether we can talk about telephone tapping
in the newspapers that secret methods in the &apos; D&apos; notice refer really tomethods which are still secret, such as in those days electronic devices whichjwere not talked about and which are now, and Colonel Lohan pointed out to me in one of our conversations that as far as the examination of cablesis concerned it cannot be regarded as a secret method because it is described in full in the Official Secrets Act, 1920, where they point out the power exists for doing this.&quot;55. We have gathered, therefore, that by now any simple construction ofthis notice-whatever its original intention-has become overlaid by interpreta-tions of the meaning of the phrase &quot; secret methods and activities &quot; whichhave much restricted its apparent range. Secondly, it is impossible to treat the notice, when read as a whole, as if even on its face it imposed an absoluteban on any references to M.I.5 and M.I.6 intelligence activities. the concluding paragraph of the letter with its words &quot; as little publicity aspossible&quot;, and Note (i) to the Appendix, which recognises that editors arenot expected to treat as secret such intelligence methods as are &quot; to someextent common knowledge &quot;, show that not so much all publicity as some special kinds of publicity are what is discouraged. Indeed the later part ofthat Note goes a long way to suggest to readers that on this particularpoint the silence that it asked for is no more than silence on stories aboutmethods and activities directed at particular persons and in particular cases.56. The impression that we have formed is that the notice has by now come to be interpreted in this limited sense. It is not an unfair one, takingthe wording as it stands. But we are bound to say that, if that is all thatit is intended to mean, its purport could have been, and could now be,expressed in much simpler and shorter words. Indeed, we were left by our witnesses in very considerable uncertainty whether, according to this inter-pretation, there is any such thing to-day as a secret intelligence method.The practices of opening mail, of inspecting telegrams, of tapping telephones,are common knowledge in the sense that it is widely known that they can beresorted to. But then it is no secret either that there are complicated andingenious listening and visual devices to which at any rate some intelligenceagencies resort. We cannot believe that it was really intended by the Services,Press and Broadcasting Committee that it is only the employment by our intelligence services of really unknown and hitherto undiscovered devices thatis to be protected from description.57. It seems to us probable that some of the difficulty that has arisen, whichhas presented an unsolved problem to the Secretary, Colonel Lohan, can betraced to overfine distinctions between methods and activities which are secretin the sense that they are carried out without advertisement and under pre-cautions designed to conceal them and methods and activities which aresecret in the sense that there is no public knowledge of their very existence.We invite the attention of the Committee to this question and to the desirabilityof rewriting the &apos; D&apos; notice of April, 1956, as a whole. It is possible that its current operation gives less protection to intelligence methods and activitiesthan the agencies responsible can fairly require. It is not altogether satis-factory to rely on silence only when the story touches &quot; particular cases and persons &quot;, because it is often impossible for those not behind the scenes toknow in time whether the story they print does trench upon this restriction
or not. That requires a knowledge of the whole secret operation; andalthough, if he is alive to the possibility, an editor may be able to obtainassistance from prior consultation with the Secretary, it is too much to expect that in such cases the security services should be ready to pass out informationas to what is really going on.58. We hope that this difficult question will receive the attention that its importance, we think, deserves. It is not useful for us to say any more than this. &apos; D&apos; notices are produced only if the Committee give them their sanc-tion; and they are effective only if editors in general are willing to observethem. The &apos; D&apos; notice system by itself can achieve no more than that.59. There remains the &apos; D &apos; notice of October, 1961. Its wording is perhapsunavoidably cryptic. It speaks of the &quot;interception of foreign communica-tions for secret intelligence purposes&quot;. Probably the whole subject tellsagainst clear or explicit wording, but we should ourselves have supposed, asreaders of the notice, that the words in question applied more naturally toother possible methods of interception than to the scrutiny of incoming andoutgoing cables, which it would be odd to describe as &quot; foreign communica-tions &quot;. This notice too invites the interpretation that it is only occasionaloperations, and those particularly directed to defence purposes, that are intended. We think that it is reasonable to read it in this way and that itcould not well be interpreted by an editor as covering the general routinescrutiny of incoming and outgoing cables that the Daily Express story referredto. We are, of course, aware that this particular point leaves open thedifference between the process of collection and the process of sorting: butthe practical working out of this difference lies beyond the range of thisReport.60. We conclude, therefore, that it would not be right to say that thearticle amounted to a breach of the &apos; D&apos; notices.Was there a breach of the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure and conventions?61. We camiot deal with this issue separately from the one we have dis-cussed above at any length, because our finding on it is implied in what we have already said about the nature and working of the &apos; D &apos; notice system and in the narrative of the facts that we have given.62. What is the briefest summary of all that happened? The relevant&apos; D&apos; notices were certainly brought to Mr. Pincher&apos;s attention by the Secre-tary on Monday, 20th February, but after the luncheon meeting and discussion Mr. Pincher cannot be blamed for leaving with the impression that the &apos; D&apos; notices themselves made little contribution, if any, to the ques-tion whether to publish or not to publish. Mr. Pincher was not the Editor ;his report to his editor that his story was &quot; cleared &quot; for &apos; D&apos; notices mayhave been an exaggeration of what he ought to have thought; but his editor,knowing Mr. Pinchefs close relations with Colonel Lohan and that he had just come from an interview with him, did nothing unreasonable in takinghis statement at its face value. We find no evidence to indicate that thedecision to publish was taken with a deliberate intention of evading ordefying the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure.
63. After this decision had been taken (and implemented in the Glasgowedition) Sir Max Aitken&apos;s attention was dramatically directed to the &apos; D \notice question by the telephone call from the Foreign Secretary; and atlater times during the night, Mr. Greig, speaking for the Foreign Secretary,repeated the same claim. But in the end no one but the editor involvedcan decide whether he is going to treat a particular news item or article asbeing covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice. There is no convention under the system that requires him to treat interventions on the point, from however eminenta source, as bringing something under a &apos; D&apos; notice which he judges to beoutside it. He may yield to the intervention, for any of several reasons,but there is no convention that requires that he should or puts him at faultif he does not. In this particular case Mr. Marks thought that, whatever the wider public issues might be, he had sound reasons for saying that thosewho were familiar with and operated the &apos; D&apos; notice system had concededthat his article was not affected by any notice.64. There is not, we must point out, any procedure under this system which requires an editor to observe a &quot; stop &quot; on publication in those cases(and they would, it seems, be exceptional cases) where the Secretary, onbehalf of the Committee, maintains that a &apos; D&apos; notice request is involved and the editor is unable to agree that it is. There could be such situations,though the incident that we have been describing, on the facts, hardly comes within it: and there could in theory be some sort of appeal procedure pending a decision on which publication would be postponed. We shall refer tothis point as a possible improvement of the procedure, in the closing portionof our Report: but, as things stand, it must be taken, we think, that neitherthe Secretary nor anyone else has any authority to give a binding interpre-tation to an editor or to require him to hold up material until an appealreference has been made to some agreed authority.Part IIIPossible Improvements to&apos; D &apos; Notice System65. We have come to the conclusion that there is not much in the wayof alteration that can usefully be recommended for the &apos; D &apos; notice system-It is not that anyone familiar with its working thinks of it as perfect or as so-constructed as to offer a guarantee that mistakes or breaches will never occur.It is, after all, a voluntary arrangement, embracing a very large number of independent publications, directed to securing the suppression of certain categories of news which arise, often under great pressure of handling, inunpredictable forms and combinations. But what was emphasised to us bya number of witnesses was that, despite its imperfections, it has workedeffectively for a considerable number of years, and, so far as we could learn,its working has not been a cause of any substantial dissatisfaction tothose who are party to it. This is a striking fact when it is recalled thatwe are speaking of a free Press which is alive to the importance of assertingits independence of Government control. It indicates a sense of responsibility and an editorial care that are very much to the credit of all concerned, andwe do not think that they should go unrecorded in any Report that deals,with the system.
66. It is this very fact, however, of the system&apos;s proved effectiveness thatflakes us reluctant to recommend any alterations in it that would impose upon it a more formal or elaborate structure, because, while they might makeit look more ship-shape and water-tight on paper, we think that there is a real danger that the whole thing might break down under the added strain. And,if it did, we know of no alternative that could be put in its place. It is notdifficult, for instance, to see that there would be a larger margin of pro-tection for the security interests at stake, if some scheme were introduced for holding back items of news about which a &apos; D&apos; notice dispute had arisenfor some agreed period of time, to allow a &quot; breathing space &quot; for furtherconsideration, or if provision were made for some regular system of appeal toan independent arbitrator for the resolution of such disputes. Ideas of thiskind were suggested to us by more than one of our witnesses.67. On the whole we do not recommend such proposals for adoption. Theyseem to us to contradict the underlying assumption on which the scheme hasrested, that in the last resort editorial control and responsibility remain with each individual newspaper. We believe that the scheme has worked largely because of the recognition of this principle. If, at some critical point of a dispute, the decision to publish or not to publish were to be taken out of thehands of the editor and handed over to some outside person or body, witharbitral, not editorial functions, the nature of the system would have beenfundamentally changed. This is, in our view, not to its or the public&apos;sadvantage. But, even putting that objection on grounds of policy aside, weforesee very real practical difficulties in implementing such a scheme, even ifit were to be favoured by both sides of the Services, Press and broadcasting committee. The pressure of time in what may be a matter of competitivepublication tells against the feasibility of fixing an agreed period of timefor the &quot; breathing space &quot;: and we have not been able to arrive at any ideawhich seemed convincing to ourselves as to where the independent arbitratorwas to be found who would be ready to carry out at very short notice the delicate work of adjudication. Certainly, as was made plain to us, such a function cannot be discharged by the Committee itself or any one or more of its members.68. We shall have one or two points of detail to make later, but our general view is that the &apos; D&apos; notice system, while very valuable, is- not goingto be improved by further elaboration. If a useful leason is to be extracted from the incident that we have been investigating, the first question to askis, &quot; What went wrong?&quot; Most of our witnesses agreed in describing the incident to us as being something altogether exceptional. Perhaps it was;but one must be chary of accepting such explanations, for if exceptions arefollowed by exceptions, in the end there is not much left of the original rule.In what way, then, was this an exceptional case? No doubt it was contributed to by the misunderstanding about the manner of presenting the Governmenfsrequest which arose between the Foreign Office and Colonel Lohan, who wasto be spokesman. But this defect in itself was no more than the product ofinadequate preparatory exchanges on the official side, and such slips can be avoided by better co-ordinated arrangements which ensure that the Secretaryof the Committee and the Departments concerned are really at one as to theline that they wish to take.  It is nearer the mark, we think, to say that the
case was exceptional because there was never at any time any clear under-standing between those speaking for the Government on one side and thos^speaking for the Daily Express on the other as to whether the issue betweenthem was the observance of &apos; D&apos; notices or a question of non-publication on grounds of the general public interest. Confusion of this sort has, probably,been very unusual in the working of the &apos; D&apos; notice system, and we think thatthere is indeed a great deal to be said for making an effort to secure that it canbe avoided for the future. Grievances are bound to arise if it is not.69. In our view what is needed is a closer delimitation of the functions ofthe Secretary. He will always be the central figure in the working of thesystem, and it is well that he should be so: but at the same time he mustnot be given a heavier load of responsibility to carry than it is fair to require.His true province is the territory of the&apos; D &apos; notice scheme and the maintenanceof its smooth and efficient working. That is no small task. But, if therearises one of those occasional wider questions that lie outside the interpretation of &apos;D&apos; notices, we doubt very much whether it is the right thing that theSecretary should assume the role of the Government^ spokesman. If he actsin this way, he steps out of his position as Secretary of the Committee,managing and interpreting its requests with its authority behind him, and itis not so easy to see for whom and with what authority he does speak. Thisleads us to think that the real lesson of the present case is that the secretary was left to act too much on his own, with the result that there was nevera time until it was too late for effective intervention to be possible foranyone but himself to make those approaches to the newspaper which,whether they would have been successful or not in the event, would havemade it directly plain to the editor how much concern the government attached to the handling of the matter.70. We think that it would be more satisfactory practice for theSecretary to bring in higher authority at an early date, if he found himselfconfronted with a situation such as this incident. He may find himself in unresolved dispute with a newspaper as to the application of a &apos; D&apos;notice or, possibly, protesting against a proposed publication on grounds of security interest to which current &apos;D&apos; notices have no apparent applica-tion. If so, he should, we think, make it his business to report at once for instructions to the Chairman of the Committee, who will be, under present arrangements, the Permanent Under Secretary at the Ministry ofDefence. The Chairman will have to decide what is the best course ofaction to adopt. There is no single line to follow for all occasions. if further or clearer advice is needed from the Government Departments con-cerned or the security organisations, the Chairman&apos;s position of authority will enable him to assemble this at short notice. He will be able to discuss with the Secretary the possibility of asking for the issue of an emergency&apos; D&apos; notice under the procedure we have mentioned earlier and thealternative of himself making a direct approach to the editor concerned.Much will depend in each case on the urgency and importance of theissue. It is not necessarily advantageous, if the application of &apos; D&apos; noticeshas not become the central issue in the dispute, that the approach to the newspaper should come through either the Chairman or the Secretaryof the Committee: it may be a matter in which the interested Department
ipan best say what it wants to say for itself. The great thing, in our view,ps that the &apos; D&apos; notice system and the Secretary working on its behalfshould not be asked to carry a heavier load of responsibility than it was designed to bear. If, as is probable, the Chairman thinks that his manyofficial preoccupations will prevent him from being readily available to theSecretary on occasions of emergency, it will no doubt be equally satis-factory for him to ask his colleague on the Committee, the second permanent under Secretary, Ministry of Defence, to act as his deputy for these purposes.71. We add two minor recommendations on the position of the Secretary,also designed to lighten the very difficult and delicate task that the systemimposes on him.(1) We think that he ought to have a deputy in his post. It is notreasonable to expect one man to provide the continuous availabilitythat Press working conditions require, the more so as the kind ofwork that he does is likely to involve frequent absences from his office. Besides, a man cannot make proper arrangements for hisholidays, if he has no deputy familiar with his work.(2) Effort must be made to see that the Secretary is properly informed as to the facts that lie behind any &apos; D&apos; notice request. We quiteappreciate that these facts will be of varying degrees of secrecy,and, speaking generally, it cannot be expected that more than abare outline can be passed on to members of the Press, howevertrustworthy the recipients. A good deal will always have to betaken on trust trust that a request is really called for by theneeds of security and that the system is not being abused in theinterest of convenience. A Secretary must have the confidence ofthe Press if he is to carry out his duties, and for this purpose he must, we think, be able to impart the conviction that he, at anyrate, is &quot; in the picture &quot; and that what he proposes is somethingas to the need of which he is personally satisfied. Unless he isequipped to convey that impression, his appeal is bound to losemuch of its force.Constitution of the Committee72. We have set out the membership and make-up of the Committeein Appendix II. It was suggested to us that the time has come for some changes in the representation of the official side. At present the Ministryof Defence, though no doubt the Department more concerned with &apos; D&quot;notices than any other, has four representatives, the Permanent UnderSecretary himself and three second Permanent Under Secretaries, the threelatter deriving from the three separate Service Departments who have nowbeen united in the Ministry of Defence. We agree that it would be an advantage if two of these second Permanent Under Secretaries of State wereto drop out and room were found in their place for representationof other Departments which, though concerned from time to time withthe issue and working of a &apos; D&apos; notice, have not hitherto been represented on the Committee. The Home Office seems an obvious choice for one place,and we recommend that it should be filled by the Permanent Under Secretary
of State, Home Office. On the whole we think that there is a good case for.inviting the Foreign Office to fill the other vacancy, since &apos; D&apos; notices d^joften have some bearing on aspects of the country&apos;s foreign affairs and foreign relations. If, say, a Deputy Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, wereto join the Committee, we think that it would be useful both to its members and to the Foreign Office.Publication of &apos; D&apos; notices73. We devote a section to this subject only because it was put in con-troversy by articles in the issues of the Spectator dated 3rd and 10th March,1967 respectively. The first article published verbatim the relevant parts ofthe two &apos; D&apos; notices to which the Prime Minister had alluded in the Houseof Commons, inserting them as part of a political commentary by Mr. AlanWatkins entitled &quot; Mr. Wilson and the press &quot;. The second article was entitled&quot;&apos; D&apos; Notices and the Spectator&quot;, and its purport was to explain to itsreaders that, while the publication of &apos; D &apos; notices was &quot; unprecedented &quot;, the editor considered that, having regard to the Prime Ministers criticism of the daily Express in the House of Commons on 21st February, the precise word-ing of specific &apos; D&apos; notices had become a major public issue, andit was in the public interest that the wording should be made known. The article made two other points to which we must payattention: that the Spectator did not possess a single &apos; D&apos; notice andthat neither its present editor nor any member of the staff had everreceived any communication from the Services, Press and Broadcasting Com-mittee, and that certain of the &apos; D&apos; notices were so expressed that no breach of security was involved in making them public. In fairness to the argumentwe reproduce in full the wording of this second article-see Appendix 111(A).74. Hitherto it has never been the practice, as the article recognises, to publish &apos; D&apos; notices. It is unprecedented. The notices are clearly headed&quot; Private and Confidential&quot; or &quot; Secret &quot; and are distributed to their recipientson that understanding. It was made plain to us, on behalf of the Committee,that its members were much concerned at the Spectators action, a departure of which they disapproved, and they invited us to give our attention to thematter and express an opinion upon it. Since the publication of &apos; D&apos;notices can give away information of significance to security and the pos-sibility of their being made public might well affect the willingness ofGovernment Departments to resort to them, thus prejudicing the operationof the whole system, we though that we had better look into the incident and accordingly invited the Editor of the Spectator, Mr. Nigel Lawson, and Mr.Alan Watkins, to give us their version of the matter.75. The first question was one of fact-had the Spectator been outside the circulation range of the &apos; D&apos; notices, and, if so, why? According to the records of the Secretary&apos;s office, &apos; D&apos; notices had been regularly sent to it and several other weeklies, and shortly before he left, the late editor, Mr. IainMcLeod, had confirmed his office&apos;s correct address for this purpose. We haveno doubt that the notices had been properly sent. What had happened, as mr. Lawson explained to us in his evidence, was that it had been the practiceof previous editors, after opening and studying the contents of a notice,immediately to destroy it. No record therefore remained for an incomingeditor.   Such a practice, admirable from the point of view of security
itself, ought not to be employed under this system, since many &apos; D&apos; noticesRemain operative for years as a standing warning, while members of theeditorial staff may change at any time. But there is no need to dwell on thisparticular point, since we accept Mr. Lawson&apos;s statement to us that he had only found out what had been done with the Spectators &apos;D&apos; notices byenquiry after his two articles of 3rd and 10th March had been published and that in future, if he received &apos; D&apos; notices, he would not think it properto follow such a practice.76. He wished to be understood as having published the &apos; D&apos; notices underthe misapprehension that the Spectator was not &quot; part of the system &quot;. the text that he used was obtained by Mr. Watkins, who was allowed to makecopies of the two notices in question in the office of the Secretary. although he did not include in his copies the respective headings &quot;Private and Confi-dential&quot; and &quot; Secret&quot;, Mr. Watkins had no doubt himself that they were infact confidential communications. We are not concerned to say whether wethink that a document obtained in this way ought to have been treated as available for publication without further enquiry. We are content to proceed on the basis of Mr. Lawson&apos;s assurance that he misunderstood the positionof his paper and that he did not realise that he was making use of documentsthat would in the first instance have reached his office under the cover ofconfidentiality.77. In our view the only importance of this incident lies in its bearing on the future, for if the arguments advanced in the second Spectatorarticle are valid, an editor is entitled to exercise his own judgment whetheror not to make public any particular &apos; D&apos; notice circulated to him, if he considers that its nature is such, by reason of the generality of its terms or forsome other reason, that the mere publication of it involves no risk to security.We think that this argument is based on a false premise, in that it seeks to establish a recognisable distinction between one &apos; D&apos; notice and another in their relation to security. The mere fact of the issue of a &apos; D&apos; notice,the bare circumstance that it is necessary to issue a warning, amounts initself to a security &quot; pointer &quot; for a hostile intelligence service: and, besidesthat, it is virtually impossible to concoct an effective &apos; D&apos; notice that is sufficiently clear to tell a reader what is requested of Turn without at thesame time imparting some modicum of information of security value. Thisis an acknowledged dilemma in all &apos; D&apos; notice questions. It will not be solved by drawing distinctions of the kind suggested, and we think that theonly safe rule for everyone to proceed on, if there is to be a &apos; D&apos; notice system at all, is that all notices should be treated as confidential documents,guarded with care under editorial control and withheld from publication.78. It seemed to us that the question with the Spectator, now thatmisapprehension had been removed, came down to the simple questionwhether in future the editor was prepared to receive notices from theCommittee on these terms, which represent the hitherto accepted under-standing. No one can be forced to receive &apos; D&apos; notices&apos; if he does notsubscribe to the implications of the system ; and it is true that a weeklyof the Spectators character is only marginally concerned with most of the subjects with which they deal.79. We asked Mr. Lawson to let us know his position on this, and after consideration he furnished us with a letter dated 17th April, the contents
of which we think it best to set out in full in Appendix III(B). As will beseen, Mr. Lawson suggests that there are certain considerations of public)interest that make it undesirable that editors should be required to treat&apos; D&apos; notices received by them as confidential in all circumstances and thatan editor should be entitled to publish one at his discretion, after givingadvance warning of his intention to the Services, Press and broadcasting committee and attending to any arguments against publication that theymight put to him.80. It is, we suppose, really a matter for the Committee to decide whetherthey would be prepared to circulate &apos; D&apos; notices subject to these suggestedqualifications as to their confidential nature. We are not ourselves preparedto recommend to them the adoption of this idea. It is not that there is noweight in what is said about the public interest. But, if one takes the view,as we certainly do, that there is always a security objection to the publicationof a &apos; D &apos; notice and that the drawing of distinctions between their respectivebearings on security is not a fruitful exercise, we think that this is one ofthose issues upon which the security consideration ought to prevail. after all, the system has been operating for more than 20 years with the assent of a great many editors of a wide variety of journals, and it does not appearthat in that time any editor has felt that his public duty required him toviolate the confidentiality or to protest against it. We would not, therefore,advise the introduction of special qualifications into a scheme, which gainsby the observance of simple general rules, in order to provide for exceptionalsituations which are likely to develop, if at all, only very rarely.Conclusions and recommendations81. For convenience we summarise our conclusions and recommendations as follows:  (1) No new practice has been introduced in recent years in the procedure for the interception of telegrams which departs from the practicespreviously observed.  (Paragraph 16.)(2) The Daily Express article of Tuesday, 21st February was notinaccurate in any sense that could expose it to hostile criticism onthat score.  (Paragraph 18.)(3) The question whether there was a breach of the &apos; D&apos; notice of 27thApril, 1961 is not one that admits of a simple answer based on a mere reading of the words of the notice itself.  (Paragraph 51.)(4) At first reading the interception of cables appears clearly to be a form of &quot; secret intelligence or counter intelligence methods and activities in the United Kingdom &quot; as referred to in the &apos; D&apos; noticeof 27th April, 1956. Nevertheless, a narrower interpretation of this&apos;D&apos; notice has prevailed in practice and, in view of this, it wouldnot be right to say that the Daily Express article of Tuesday, 21stFebruary amounted to a breach of this &apos; D&apos; notice. (Paragraphs53-60.)(5) We invite the attention of the Services, Press and broadcasting committee to the desirability of rewriting the &apos; D&apos; notice of 27thApril, 1956 to clarify its application and we suggest that some widerrestriction would be justified (paragraphs 56 and 57).
(6) The wording of the &apos; D&apos; notice of 30th October, 1961 is cryptic butwe do not think that there was any breach of it. (Paragraphs 59and 60.)(7) We find no evidence to indicate that the editorial decision to publish the article was taken with a deliberate intention of evading or defying&apos; D &apos; notice procedure or conventions. (Paragraph 62.)(8) There is not much in the way of alteration that could usefully be recommended for the &apos; D &apos; notice system. (Paragraph 65.)(9) We think it unsatisfactory that the Secretary of the Services, press and Broadcasting Committee should be the Government spokesmanon questions that lie outside &apos; D&apos; notices and turn on the generalnational interest.  (Paragraph 69.)(10) The Secretary should make it his practice to report at once for instructions to the Chairman of the Services, Press and broadcasting committee if he finds himself in unresolved dispute with a newspaperas to the application of a &apos; D&apos; notice or, possibly, protesting againsta proposed publication on grounds of security interest to whichcurrent &apos; D&apos; notices have no apparent application.   (Paragraph 70.)(11) The Chairman of the Services, Press and Broadcasting Commit-tee may on occasion wish to ask his colleague on the Committee,the second Permanent Under Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence,to act as his deputy for these purposes.   (Paragraph 70.)(12) The Secretary ought to have a deputy in his post. (Paragraph 71.)(13) Effort must be made to see that the Secretary is properly informed as to the facts that lie behind any &apos; D&apos; notice request. (Para-graph 71.)(14) Two of the three second Permanent Under Secretaries of State,Ministry of Defence, should cease to be members of the Services,Press and Broadcasting Committee, and room should be found for representation of other Departments. The Permanent Under Secre-tary of State, Home Office and a Deputy Under Secretary of State,Foreign Office would be suitable persons to fill these places. (Para-graph 72.)(15) We accept that the Editor of the Spectator published the &apos; D&apos;notices under the misapprehension that his paper was not a partici-pant in the &apos; D&apos; notice system. Nevertheless we think that the onlysafe rule if there is to be a &apos; D &apos; notice system at all, is that all noticesbe treated as confidential documents, guarded with care undereditorial control and withheld from publication. (Paragraphs 76and 77.)(16) We cannot recommend the suggestion made by the Editor of theSpectator that there are certain considerations of public interest that make it undesirable that editors should be required to treat&apos; D&apos; notices received by them as confidential in all circumstances and that an editor should be entitled to publish one at his dis-cretion, after giving advance warning of his intention to the Services,Press and Broadcasting Committee and attending to any arguments against publication that they might put to him. (Paragraph 80.)
82. In conclusion, we wish to record our appreciation of the services ofour Secretary, Mr. D. J. Trevelyan. He was of great assistance to us in!the assembly of the material that we had to consider and his wide knowledgeof the processes of Government and his grasp of the issues that presentedthemselves in the course of our inquiry did much to help up in carryingit to completion.Radcliffe.Emanuel Shinwell.Selwyn Lloyd.D.

Lohan, M.B.E., T.D.APPENDIX IIIA&quot;Spectator&apos;: 10th March, 1967&apos; D &apos; notices and the &apos; Spectator&apos;A certain amount of interest appears to have been aroused by the publication,in last week&apos;s Spectator, of the two &apos; D&apos; notices first referred to by the PrimeMinister in the House of Commons on 21st February. That is not unnatural.Some of the comments made, however, clearly betray a misunderstanding bothof our reasons ior deciding on this step and, in particular, of the circumstances in which the decision td publish was taken. It would be wrong to allow thesemisunderstandings to continue.
Many newspaper offices possess files of &apos; D&apos; notices, supplied to them by theServices, Press and Broadcasting Committee. It is a convention that they donot take advantage of this by publishing any of these notices. The Spectatordoes not and did not possess a single &apos; D&apos; notice. Neither the presentEditor of the Spectator, nor any member of his staff, has ever received any communication of any kind from the Services, Press and Broadcasting Committee.Nor had any one of them ever seen a &apos; D&apos; notice until Alan Watkins was permitted, on 28th February, to copy out the text of the two notices to whichthe Prime Minister had referred. Regrettably, although perhaps not surprisingly,recollections of the conversation that took place on that occasion appear to differ,Alan Watkins is prepared at any time to give his own account of the conversationto the Radcliffe Committee set up to inquire into the matter of the Daily Expressand the &apos; D &apos; notice system, should that committee invite him to do so ; and forthe present it is proper to leave the matter there.Of far greater importance, however, is the question of the decision to publishitself. Broadly speaking, &apos; D &apos; notices come in two kinds. First, there are thosenotices which request the press not to refer to a specific, named, secret. Plainly,publication of a &apos; D&apos; notice of this type would be both a contravention of thenotice itself and a breach of security. As well as this, however, there is a group of notices which ask the press not to publish information of a particular classwhich is merely described in general terms in the notices themselves. Publicationof a &apos; D&apos; notice of the second kind is not a contravention of that notice, revealsno secret and constitutes no breach of security. The two &apos; D &apos; notices referredto by the Prime Minister and published in last week&apos;s Spectator were of this second kind.Nevertheless, we should not have taken the unprecedented decision to publishthem had we not believed that it was clearly in the public interest to do so. Atquestion time in the House of Commons on 21st February the Prime minister had no need to accuse the Daily Express of &quot; a clear breach of two &apos; D &apos; notices &quot;.Until he did so, the only questions in the minds of Members of parliament and the public alike were whether the Daily Express allegations about cable-vetting, and its hints that cables were being passed on to the Treasury and board of Trade, were true or false ; and, if true, under what authority these activities were being carried out. Once he had gratuitously decided to make an issue of the two &apos; D&apos; notices, however, a totally new situation arose. For thefirst time the precise wording of a specific &apos; D&apos; notice as against the natureof the system itself had become a major public issue. The only way in whicheither the public or the House of Commons could reach an informed judgment on this issue was by studying the two &apos; D&apos; notices concerned. This we enabledthem to do.BThe Spectator,99 Gower Street,London, W.C. 1.17th April, 1967.Dear Lord Radcliffe,When I appeared before your Committee on 11th April you asked me toconsider the possibility of a solemn undertaking not to publish any &apos; D&apos; noticebeing made an explicit condition of a newspapers inclusion in the system, and you further asked me to indicate whether, on these terms, the Spectator wouldelect to be within or outside the &apos; D &apos; notice system. This question clearly getsright to the heart of the matter, and I am most grateful to you for your courtesyin allowing me time to give a thoroughly considered reply.My answer is as follows. If the choice before a newspaper editor were as you suggest, the Spectator would, with misgivings, choose to be included in the&apos; D&apos; notice system, rather than remain outside it; broadly on the grounds that31
it is in the public interest that newspapers should be part of the &apos; D&apos; notice system.I would, however, strongly deprecate a situation in which newspapers were forced to choose between inclusion in the system, on condition that they gave a binding commitment not to publish any &apos; D&apos; notice, in whole or in part, inall circumstances ; and total exclusion from the system. I would suggest that thequestion of publication might more appropriately be dealt with in some other way. For example, a newspaper might give an undertaking that it would on no account publish the text of a &apos; D &apos; notice, in whole or in part, without firstannouncing its intention, and explaining its reasons, to the Services, Press and broadcasting Committee.The Committee would then consider whether or not publication was in thepublic interest and give its verdict. If it were to decide that there were good reasons for the proposed publication, and no security objections to this course,then all newspapers would be free to publish with the Committee&apos;s acquiescence.If, however, it were to decide against publication, then this would normally be respected by the editor of the newspaper involved. He would however,in the last resort, still retain the right to publish if he still felt strongly that itwas in the public interest to do so, taking his chance with the Official Secrets Actsin the normal way. This procedure would, however, have enabled the Committee(a) to receive advance warning of his intention, and (b) to present to the editorconcerned the arguments against publication.It seems to me that a system along the lines I have suggested would be more in keeping with a voluntary system in general and the existing &apos; D &apos; notice system in particular than would the requirement that any newspaper that is part ofthe system must sign a binding declaration not to publish under any circumstances.It would, for example, clearly make nonsense of a &apos; voluntary&apos; system if member-ship of it were dependent on newspaper editors agreeing to accept requests ascommands ; and the question of publication, although different, is analogous to this. In other words, I am suggesting that the requirement not to publish &apos; D &apos;notices, in whole or in part, should in effect have a status similar to that of a&apos; D&apos; nodce request, rather than that of a binding and unchallengeablecommitment.I think it is only right to add that, in my opinion, the question of thedesirability of publishing a &apos; D&apos; notice, in whole or in part, is likely, in practice,to arise ofdy very rarely indeed. The statements made in the House of commons by the Prime Minister about the Daily Express, which led the Spectator to publish the two &apos; D&apos; notices referred to, were most exceptional; and I would not expect this sort of situation to occur at all frequently in the future.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)

A (i)(GOVERNMENT SUBMISSION TO THE RADCLIFFE COMMITTEE)The Application of the &apos; D &apos; notice Procedure to the CaseThe operation of the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure was described in the Report on security Procedures in the Public Serviced Essentially this procedure has remained unaltered, as the Radcliffe Committee recommended, although theServices Press and Broadcasting Committee has recently commissioned a reviewof the &apos; D &apos; notices in force, to determine what amendments and clarifications tothem may be necessary ; and this is now nearing completion.2. Of the sixteen &apos; D &apos; notices currently in force, the two relevant to the presentsituation are those issued on 27th April, 1956, and 30th October, 1961. The first of these covers, inter alia, &quot; secret intelligence or counter-intelligence methods and activities in or outside the United Kingdom &quot;f ; and the second covers(a) the nature of cyphering work carried out in Government Communica-tions Establishments; and(b) the various methods used in the interception of foreign communicationsfor secret intelligence purposes.3. &apos;D &apos; notices are designed to indicate the subject matter which it would be against the interests of national security for the Press to disclose. They are issued with the approval of the Committee as a whole, including its Press members,and are therefore in the nature of self-denying ordinances. Perhaps the mostimportant function of the Secretary of the Services Press and Broadcasting Com-mittee in working this system is to provide a service of advice to newspapersabout whether any particular story or piece of copy falls under a &apos; D &apos; notice. Thisis often a question of relating the content of the story to the actual secret activity in question. Here the Secretary of the Committee is of course in a far better position to judge the matter than the newspaper which is not and cannot be as fully informed of the exact nature of the secret activity, or of the damage to national security that might be caused. This is precisely the area in which theapplication of the &apos; D &apos; notice system becomes a matter of trust and confidencebetween the newspaper and the Secretary of the Committee, as the Report of theprevious Radcliffe Committee emphasised J.4. In the present case the content of the Press story was essentially that copiesof all overseas telegrams from the private cable companies and/or the G.P.O.were scrutinised by security authorities. This is substantially true, though theseveral variants of the story were inaccurate in detail particularly. ...The actual secret activity in question was. . . .The Press stories revealed enough of this activity to, give a strong indication of its true nature. . . .5. In the official view therefore there is no doubt that the story falls under the relevant part of both the two &apos; D &apos; notices. . . .6.....7. The Daily Express appeared to have argued that as the Official Secrets Actcontains powers to require cable companies by Warrant to make copies of tele-grams available, there could be no objection to publishing a story about this practice. But the Official Secrets Act merely conveys powers ; it does not describehow they are used or reveal that any categories of telegrams are in fact madeavailable for scrutiny.8. In arguing with Colonel Lohan, Mr. Chapman Pincher contended that the&apos; D &apos; notice of 1956 did not apply to the story because its application in this case had been nullified by the &apos; D &apos; notice of 31st October, 1957 (q.v.). This latter &apos; D &apos;notice was issued as a result of the publication of the Birkett Reportg and wasto the effect that the Press could no longer be asked to maintain secrecy on the* Cmd. 1681 of April 1962, Chapter 9. ^t &apos;D&apos; notice of 27th April 1956 paragraph 3 (i).t Paragraphs 125 and 131.g Cmnd. 283 of October 1957 Report of the Committee of Privy Councillors appointedto inquire into the Interception of Communications.
use of &quot; telephone tapping &quot; as one of the methods employed by the security service. Mr. Pincher maintained that the practice of intercepting telegrams wasexactly parallel with telephone interception and that disclosure of it was thereforealso exempted from the terms of the 1956 &apos;D&apos; notice. This argument appears tohave no real basis. The 1957 &apos; D &apos; notice referred only to &quot; telephone tapping &quot;,which is not the same practice as that of collecting and scrutinising copies of telegrams. The reason for the 1957 &apos; D &apos; notice was that the official use of &quot; tele-phone tapping &quot; for certain purposes had already been disclosed in the BirkettReport. . . .9. All clandestine operations for intelligence or security purposes must obviously by their very nature be conducted away from the light of publicity and cannot properly achieve their purpose or even be carried out at all if they become a matter of public discussion. If the methods used are discussedpublicly even to an extent that is not in itself damaging to security, this is liableto lead to further enquiry and disclosures that will be damaging. In the present case, for example. . . . Moreover, sensationalised accounts of such arrangements are liable to create a situation in which it could become necessary either tomake public actual details of the operation and of the issues at stake in order toassuage public anxiety, or to suspend the operation altogether. The first of these alternatives would certainly rob the operation of some of its remaining value. Thesecond would place this country at a very serious disadvantage, . . .10. . . . Public disclosure of this practice is liable to diminish its value and effectiveness and for this reason it was protected by &apos; D &apos; notice.A (ii)(GOVERNMENT SUBMISSION TO THE RADCLIFFE COMMITTEE)The Circumstances surrounding the Publication of an Article in the daily express of 2\st February entitled &quot; Cable Vetting Sensation &quot; in relation to the&apos; D &apos; notice SystemPart INarrative of Events1. This narrative covers official dealings with the Press and with the Secretaryof the Services Press and Broadcasting Committee, Colonel L. G. Lohan, overthe episode in question. Colonel Lohan will be producing separately to theEnquiry his own account of these events and of what passed between him and therepresentatives of the newspapers concerned. Although he is in a sense agovernment official and is paid as such, he is essentially the servant of the Com-mittee, which is not a governmental body and contains a majority of unofficial members. It has therefore not been thought proper for^him to participate indrawing up this account of events from the official side, although the explanationshe gave the Chairman of his Committee, Sir James Dunnett, at the request of thePrime Minister, have been included and taken into consideration, and thisnarrative of course covers the conversations he had with Government officials at the time. There is thus no reason to suppose that he would dissent from itin any important particular.2. The background against which these events took place is that the &apos; D &apos;notice system is voluntary and rests upon goodwill and mutual understanding.The function of the Secretary is to help administer the system and to provideadvice to the Press about what matters fall within a range of subjects covered bya particular &apos; D &apos; notice or notices. If he requests a newspaper not to publish a story it follows that he considers or has received official advice that the subject matter falls under a &apos; D &apos; notice. Thereafter, as the system is not mandatory,his only weapon in trying to ensure that the newspaper does not use the storyis persuasion. His consultations with officials on this occasion, as on other similar ones, therefore centred mainly on the problem of how far he could safely go and what line of argument he could use in this process of persuasion,without giving away secret information that should be withheld.35
3. The leakage to the Press about the practice of scrutinising copies of over-seas telegrams first came to official notice on Wednesday, 15th February 1967,.... On the same day the Chief Press Officer of the Ministry of Defence,Mr. N. Taylor, was approached by Mr. Angus Macpherson of the Daily Mail,who said he had heard that telex transmissions were collected once a day by theMinistry of Defence (M.O.D.), and screened by security officials. Mr. Taylorpromised to investigated4. On the afternoon of the following day, Thursday, 16th February, it appearsthat Mr. Chapman Pincher of the Daily Express consulted Colonel Lohan abouta story to the effect that the Ministry of Defence collected from the G.P.O.copies of overseas telegrams ; Colonel Lohan states that he told Mr. Pincherthere was no &apos; D&apos; notice mentioning this and that he advised Mr. Pincher to consult the Ministry of Defence and then to refer back to him. Shortly after3 p.m., Mr. Pincher telephoned Wing Commander Harris of the Ministry ofDefence Press Office and asked him about the story. Wing Commander Harrisundertoook to make enquiries.5. Shortly after this second enquiry from the Press, Mr. Taylor, the ChiefPress Officer at the Ministry of Defence, consulted Mr. . . . agreed that the bestline for the Ministry of Defence Press Office to take was that the story was&quot; nonsense &quot;. This line was decided because the Ministry of Defence are not infact engaged in the collection or the scrutinising of file copies of overseas telegramsor telex communications.6. At 6 p.m. on the evening of 16th February, Mr. Taylor (Ministry of DefenceChief Press Officer) accordingly told Mr. Macpherson of the Daily Mail that the story was &quot; nonsense&quot;. Wing Commander Harris gave a similar reply, on anunattributable basis, to Mr. Pincher of the Daily Express. On the same evening,Mr. Pincher also approached the G.P.O. Press Office with a similar story, allegingthat copies of all cables being sent out of the country were being sent to theMinistry of Defence in the old Admiralty building. After consulting the G.P.O.,the Press Office told Mr. Pincher that his story was untrue. They did so forthe same reason as the Ministry of Defence: that the story was factuallyincorrect f.7. On the following morning, Friday, 17th February, ... On learningof the situation Foreign Office called an urgent meeting that afternoon, withrepresentatives of ... to consider the line of action and comment to betaken. Meanwhile Mr. . . . had discussed the story with Colonel Lohan.After consulting . . . Mr. . . . asked Colonel Lohan to act as decisivelyas possible to get the article suppressed. Colonel Lohan then reported to . . .that the Daily Mail had agreed to drop the story on the understanding that theywould not be &quot; scooped &quot;; and that Mr. Pincher had agreed to hold the storyuntil Monday, 20th February, when he wished to discuss it with Colonel Lohan.8. At the meeting in Foreign Office held by Mr. Ewart-Biggs it was agreedthat(a) the Security Service should brief Colonel Lohan to continue his efforts toget the Daily Express to suppress the story on &apos; D &apos; notice grounds, without giving Mr. Pincher any gratuitous information about the actual inter-ception of telegrams or the extent and purpose of this. The relevant&apos; D &apos; notices were those of 27th April, 1956, covering secret intelligence and counter-intelligence methods and activities, and of 30th October, 1961,covering the interception of foreign communications for secret intelligencepurposes.(b) in response to any press enquiries, spokesmen of all Whitehall depart-ments concerned should take the line that they never comment onstories of this kind..   (c) .   .   .   .  .* See Appendix I.t See Appendix II.
Mr. Ewart-Biggs told the Permanent Under Secretary of the Foreign Office andthe Secretary of the Cabinet of this proposed line of action and they agreed with it. The position was then reported to the Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary,and later to the Prime Minister.9. As had been agreed at the meeting, Mr. ... of the Security Service spoke to Colonel Lohan that evening.* Colonel Lohan confirmed that the daily mail had undertaken not to carry the story and that Mr. Pincher would holdit over until he had seen Colonel Lohan on the following Monday.10. Mr. Ewart-Biggs (Foreign Office) was in contact with Colonel Lohanon Saturday, 18th February and again on Monday, 20th February in order to learn how the matter stood and to discuss the line being taken with the daily express. Mr. . . . also spoke to Colonel Lohan on the morning of Monday,20th February and there was consultation between the Foreign Office and . . .about the line that Colonel Lohan might take with Mr. Pincher. The objectof this was to ensure that advice given to Colonel Lohan was properly concerted.11. The basic position was obvious and quite clear:(a) that in the official view the story related to an activity covered by the&apos; D &apos; notices of 1956 and 1961.(b) that Colonel Lohan should continue to do all he could to get Mr.Chapman Pincher to drop the story, on &apos; D&apos; notice grounds.(c) that at the same time he should as far as possible avoid revealing the true nature, extent and purpose of the activity. . . .12. The problem about which Colonel Lohan needed official advice was howfar he could go and what arguments he could use in seeking to convince Mr.Pincher. Colonel Lohan foresaw two difficulties. Firstly, the &apos; D &apos; notice of1961 referred to the interception of communications for secret intelligencepurposes and it would therefore be difficult to convince Mr. Pincher that itapplied without revealing what was actually involved. On this point Mr.Ewart-Biggs agreed that Colonel Lohan would not lean too heavily upon these words in the &apos; D &apos; notice and that it would be better to take the line thatthe story involved an area of activity generally falling under &apos; D&apos; notices and togive the impression, without going into details, that what was in question was amatter of the defence of the Realm.13. Secondly, Mr. Pincher was taking the line that the story involved a large scale invasion of privacy and that he had therefore a public duty to publishit. It was agreed that if he thought it would help in countering this argumentColonel Lohan could (a) tell Mr. Pincher that the activity in question was properly authorisedunder the Official Secrets Act, 1920, and(b) indicate, without going into details, that what was involved was not awholesale censorship but was in fact extremely selective and that inorder to identify particular communications on which there was anational security interest some kind of sorting process was necessary.Mr. Ewart-Biggs accordingly gave Colonel Lohan this advice.14. Colonel Lohan then lunched with Mr. Pincher. The position, as sub-sequently reported by Colonel Lohan to Mr. Ewart-Biggsf and Mr. . . .was that Colonel Lohan thought he had convinced Mr. Pincher not to use the story ; Mr. Pincher had said he would refer to his Editor.15. At about 3.30 p.m., Colonel Lohan told Mr. . . . that the story wasbeing referred by both papers to their senior Editors because each was afraid of being &quot; scooped&quot; by the other. Colonel Lohan repeated this informationlater to Mr.....* See Appendix V.t See Appendix VI.37

Colonel Lohan repeated this informationlater to Mr.....* See Appendix V.t See Appendix VI.37
16. At about 6 p.m., Colonel Lohan reported to Mr. . . . and then toMr. Ewart-Biggs (a) that the Editor of the Daily Mail had definitely agreed not to publish the story ;(b) that Mr. Pincher had seen his Editor who had asked him to write up his story so that the Editor could see what it looked like and consult the daily Express&apos;s lawyers. Mr. Pincher had told Colonel Lohan that he did not think the Daily Express would publish the story, at all eventsthat evening, and had undertaken to tell Colonel Lohan in advance if thepaper did decide to publish.17. At this stage Colonel Lohan told Mr. . . . that the Daily Expressapparently thought that because the legal powers covering the practice were set out in Section 4 (1) of the Official Secrets Act (1920) they were entitled to publish. Mr. . . . replied that questions of law should not be confused with&apos; D &apos; notice questions and that in this case H.M.G. were pinning their coloursto the &apos; D &apos; notice mast; he then suggested to Colonel Lohan that as there was now some risk of the story being published, he should perhaps consult theChairman of the &apos; D&apos; Notice Committee, Sir James Dunnett. Colonel Lohanreported the position to Sir James Dunnett shortly afterwards.18. At about 7 p.m., Mr. Greenhill* (Foreign Office) told the foreign secretary what had happened during the day between Colonel Lohan and Mr.Pincher. The Foreign Secretary suggested that he should then telephone SirMax Aitken and ask for the story to be suppressed. Mr. Greenhill advised that it would be better to handle the matter through normal channels for thetime being. He explained that Colonel Lohan thought the Daily Express were unlikely to publish that night and that in any case there would be a further opportunity to comment (since Mr. Pincher had promised to give Colonel Lohanadvance warning of any decision to publish).19. Shortly before 10 p.m., Colonel Lohan told Mr. . . . and Mr. . . .by telephone that Mr. Pincher had just rung to say that the Daily Expresswere running the story in their Glasgow edition. Colonel Lohan added thathe had at once tried to reach the Editor of the Daily Express, Mr. DerekMarks, but had been told that he was out. He had spoken to the NightEditor, who told him the story could not now be stopped. Mr. . . . imme-diately passed this information to Mr. Ewart-Biggs, who telephoned to Mr.Greenhill. Mr. Greenhill therefore telephoned the Foreign Secretary and suggested that he might now speak to Sir Max Aitken. At about 10.20 p.m.,the Foreign Secretary telephone Sir Max Aitken t who said that he hadMr. Marks by his side. The Foreign Secretary explained that the &apos; D &apos; noticemachinery operated in this case and urged him not to print the story. SirMax said &quot; Very well, I will kill the story&quot;. Mr. Greenhill informed Mr.Ewart-Biggs of this at about 10.30.20. Meanwhile, however, Colonel Lohan had on his own initiative told the daily Mail that the Daily Express were publishing the story. This was because,when the Daily Mail had undertaken not to use the story, Colonel Lohan had promised to warn them if the Daily Express did so. He had therefore felt obliged to tell them. However, on hearing from Mr. Ewart-Biggs that the daily Express had agreed to kill the story, Colonel Lohan again got the daily mail to agree in their turn not to publish it. Not long afterwards the Daily Mailtelephoned Colonel Lohan in understandable consternation to tell him thatthey now had in front of them a copy of the London edition of the daily express, carrying the story as a front page spread.21. After the Foreign Secretary had spoken to Sir Max Aitken, Mr. Greig,Jthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s Special Assistant, followed up the matter with Mr. Marks,the Editor of the Daily Express. Mr. Marks alleged that there had been a misunderstanding about the cable vetting story and a suggestion that it was* See Appendix VII.t See Appendix VIII.* See Appendix IX.
covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice the Daily Express had found to be incorrect. Mr. Marksadded (somewhat disingenuously) that they had combed through the paper tomake sure that there was no other story to which a &apos; D&apos; notice could apply.Mr. Greig gave Mr. Marks particulars of the &apos; D &apos; notice in question. Mr. Marksrefused to agree that any promise had been made to the Secretary of State.He also claimed that the situation would never have arisen if the Daily Expresshad been given proper information about the &apos;D&apos; notice earlier in the day.Just before 1 a.m., Mr. Marks telephoned Mr. Greig to say that he now accepted that the cable vetting story was covered by &apos; D&apos; notices and would therefore take it out of the paper. Five minutes later he telephoned again to say that the story was now appearing in other papers, and as the Daily Expresscould not be put in the position of being the only paper without it, he hadrescinded the order to take it out of the paper.22. The story appeared in the first London and other subsequent editionsof the Daily Express of 21st February (qv). It was also carried by the daily mail in their later editions, after they had seen it in the Daily Express. The times and other newspapers also took the story from the Daily Express.23. The Prime Minister, in answering a question by Sir James Langford-Holtin the House of Commons that afternoon about the &apos; D &apos; notices, took theopportunity to make a statement to the effect that the &apos; D &apos; notice system hadbeen called into question by the action of one newspaper in initiating asensationalised and inaccurate story purporting to describe a situation in whichthe powers and practice had not changed for well over 40 years. In reply to questions, the Prime Minister stated that this was a clear breach of two &apos; D &apos;notices, despite the fact that the newspaper concerned was repeatedly warned that it would be contravening the notices.*24. The Daily Express of the next day, 22nd February (qv), contained anarticle by Mr. Pincher and a leading article purporting to refute the PrimeMinisters statement.  In his article, Mr. Pincher alleged (a) that Colonel Lohan had agreed with him on the afternoon of 20thFebruary that neither of the two &apos; D &apos; notices of 27th April, 1956, and30th October, 1961, could reasonably be applied to the matter inquestion ; and(b) that after the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House on 21st FebruaryColonel Lohan had confirmed this.25. Accordingly, the Prime Minister requested Sir James Dunnett, who isChairman of the Services, Press and Broadcasting Committee, to obtain an explanation from Colonel Lohan. Colonel Lohan provided a statement ofhis telephone conversation on the afternoon of 21st February with Mr. Pincher.On the basis of the account he received from Sir James Dunnett of colonel lohan&apos;s explanations, the Prime Minister made a further statement in theHouse of Commons on the following day, 23rd February, in which he repeated that the story published was a breach of the long standing &apos; D&apos; notice convention and that this had been made clear to those concerned, part IIInferences to be Drawn from the NarrativeFrom the evidence and sequence of events set out in Part I it seems clearthat:(i) The official view that the secret activity to which the story related was covered by the &apos;D &apos; notices of 27th April, 1956 and 30th October, 1961,was conveyed to Colonel Lohan, as the basis of his request to the daily express and the Daily Mail under the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure not to publish the story. His problem lay in persuading Mr. Chapman Pincherof the Daily Express that the story should not be published on* Hansard 21st February, 1967 Col. 1432.t Hansard 23rd February, Col. 1975.
&apos; D &apos; notice grounds, while at the same time avoiding giving away to ajournalist known to be persistent in his pursuit of intelligence and securitymatters any secret information about what was actually involved.(ii) when deciding to publish the story the Daily Express were aware firstthat they had been requested under the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure not to doso, and secondly that the &apos; D &apos; notices in question were those of 27thApril, 1956 and 30th October, 1961. Colonel Lohan produced these two&apos; D&apos; notices to Mr. Chapman Pincher and said he was basing hisarguments upon them. Mr. Pincher had himself consulted Colonel Lohanabout the story in the first instance, which showed that there was somequestion in his mind whether it might not fall under a &apos; D&apos; notice.When he was subsequently asked not to publish the story by colonel lohan, the &apos; D &apos; notice authority, he would have known that the only possible basis for this request was that, in Colonel Lohan&apos;s informedview, the subject matter of the story fell under a &apos; D &apos; notice. Early on tuesday morning, the Editor of the Daily Express admitted to Mr. Greigthat the &apos; D &apos; notices applied to the story (Appendix IX).(iii) The Daily Express did not carry out the assurance given to the foreign secretary by Sir Max Aitken, Chairman and Joint Managing Directorof Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd., that the story would be &quot; killed &quot;.(iv) The Daily Express did not fulfil the understanding between Mr. chapman pincher and Colonel Lohan to give advance warning of any decisionto publish the story. Colonel Lohan was thus misled into thinking that there would be a further opportunity to approach the Editor ofthe Daily Express before a decision to publish was carried out. By thetime Mr. Chapman Pincher told Colonel Lohan that the story was to beused in the Glasgow edition of the Daily Express, all the necessary arrangements must in fact already have been made for running the story in the first London edition.(v) The Daily Mail properly complied with Colonel Lohan&apos;s request not touse the story: they later published it only because the Daily Expresshad already done so. The explanation given by the Editor of the daily Express to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Special Adviser, that he hadrescinded an order to take the story out of the paper because it hadalready appeared in other papers, ignored the fact that the other papershad only used the story after and because they had already seen itin the Daily Express.appendices A memorandum from the Ministry of Defence on their part in the affair.II A note from the G.P.O. on their dealings with the press.III A record made by Mr. Ewart-Biggs (Foreign Office) on the 23rd Februaryof his dealings with other Government departments and with colonel lohan.IV ... .V A memorandum from the Security Service on their dealings with colonel lohan.VI A Diary of Events, on the afternoon and evening of 20th February,recorded by Mr. Ewart-Biggs that night.VII A minute by Mr. Greenhill recording his part in the affair.VIII A record by the Foreign Secretary of his conversation with Sir Max Aitken.IX A minute by Mr. Greig on his dealings with the Daily Express on the night of the 20th February.
Memorandum on Ministry of Defence part in recent Press stories about&apos; D&apos; notices1. Mr. Neville Taylor, the Chief Press Officer of the Ministry of Defence,received a telephone call from Mr. Angus Macpherson (Defence CorrespondentDaily Mail) on Wednesday, 15th February. Mr. Macpherson said that his paper had received a &quot; tip &quot; to the effect that copies of Telex transmissions to overseas countries handed in at Post Offices were being delivered once a day to theMinistry of Defence where they were kept for 48 hours and screened bysecurity officials. He asked Mr. Taylor to follow up this enquiry. Mr Taylorexplained that he was extremely busy on preparations for the publication ofthe Defence White Paper on the following day and would therefore not be ableto take any action until after the White Paper had been published. Mr.Macpherson accepted this delay. Mr. Taylor made no comment on the storybeyond promising to make enquiries: he did however warn Mr. Macphersonthat &quot; if there was anything in the story I may find we can make no commentat all to help you &quot;.2. Shortly after 3 p.m. on Thursday, 16th February, Mr. Chapman Pincherof the Daily Express telephoned Wing Commander Harris in the Defence PressOffice with a similar story to that given to Mr. Taylor by the Daily Mail. wing commander Harris told Mr. Pincher that a similar story had been receivedfrom another paper and undertook to make enquiries and ring him back.3. Shortly after this second Press enquiry, Mr. Taylor telephoned Mr. . . .and told him about the enquiry from the Daily Mail and the Daily Express.Mr. . . . said that he had no reason to suppose that the Ministry ofDefence could have anything to do with censoring foreign cables. Mr. Taylorwas given the impression that the Press story in its present form did not makesense. Mr. . . . undertook to make enquiries and telephone Mr. Tayloras quickly as possible because any delay would be likely to arouse Press suspicion.4. Following the telephone call from Mr. Taylor Mr. . . . got in touchwith Mr. . . . Security Service and passed the story on to them. Mr. . . .was subsequently told by Mr. . . . , Security Service, that the matter hadbeen referred to Mr . . . who would shortly be getting in touch withhim. The advice subsequently given to Mr. ... by Mr. . . . was that the story was undoubtedly untrue and that our Press Office should be instructed tosay so to the newspapers.5. Mr. . . . accordingly telephoned Mr. Taylor and told him that thePress Office could definitely inform both the Mail and the Express that theirstories were &quot; nonsense&quot; but he asked that the Press Office should report anyfurther information gleaned from the two papers about the details of theirstories or of the way in which they had obtained them. Mr. Taylor undertook to report any such further information to Mr. . . . but pointed out thatit would be important not to do anything to arouse the suspicions of the twoPress reporters.6. At 6 p.m. on Thursday, 16th February, Mr. Taylor telephoned Mr.Macpherson and told him that his story was nonsense and that the daily express had made similar enquiries and were being given a similar reply.Mr. Macpherson said that he would get his office to &quot;drop the story&quot; providingwe were certain that the Express would also drop it. Mr. Taylor replied thathe could of course not guarantee that the Express would not print the story but unless he telephoned him back again he could assume that the Daily Expresswere also prepared to drop it.7. At about the same time on the evening of Thursday, 16th February,Wing Commander Harris gave a similar unattributable reply to Mr. Pincher.He added that we were astonished to hear the story and thought it ludicrous.
Mr. Pincher appeared to be satisfied when told that the Daily Mail had receivedthe same answer but he added that he was certain there was some substance in the story because he had had some confirmation of it from another source.8. On Friday, 17th February, Mr. . . . was telephoned by Mr. . . . who saidthat they were dealing with the matter and were in touch with the Foreign Office.Mr. . . . said that he would let . . . know if any further information were obtained from our Press Office.9. Later in the morning on Friday, 17th February, Mr. . . . saw wing commander Harris who reported his conversation with Mr. Pincher on theprevious evening. Wing Commander Harris said that in his view Mr. Pincherwas unlikely to let the matter drop as he thought he was on to a story whichwas substantially true and would not be fobbed off by official denials. Mr.. . . told Wing Commander Harris that for the time being the Press office should maintain that it was untrue that the Ministry of Defence had anything to do with monitoring foreign cables. In fact, there was no further enquiryfrom the Press about this story so that this answer was not used.10. On Sunday, 19th February, Mr. Taylor received another telephone callat home from Mr. Macpherson. Mr. Macpherson said that he thought thePress Office was being &quot; badly let down &quot; over the enquiry he had made onThursday. He asked whether Mr. Taylor knew that the matter was now in thehands of the Services Press and Broadcasting Committee and that both the express and Mail had been &quot; warned off publication &quot; by the Secretary of theCommittee and also whether he had known this when he had told him (Mr.Macpherson) on Thursday that his story was &quot; nonsense &quot;. Mr. Taylor assuredMr. Macpherson that he had been completely unaware of this development andwas as surprised as Mr. Macpherson to hear that the question of &apos; D &apos; noticeswas involved. Mr. Taylor promised to report to the Chief of Public relations in the Ministry of Defence this complaint that the Ministry of Defence hadintentionally misled the Daily Mail on Thursday. Mr. Macpherson acceptedthe assurance that Mr. Taylor had no ground for querying the guidance he had given him.2Sth February, 1967.APPENDIX memorandum by the General Post office. On the afternoon of Thursday, 16th February Chapman Pincher telephonedthe Director of the Public Relations Department of the Post Office saying thathe understood that all cables going out of the country were copied and the copiessent to the Ministry of Defence in the old Admiralty building.After consulting the Post Office Department responsible for overseas com-munications the D.P.R. rang Chapman Pincher at about 5 p.m. and told him the story was untrue, to which Chapman Pincher replied that he had goodevidence that it was true. D.P.R. repeated his statement and left the matter at that.2. At about 10.30 p.m. on 20th February The Times newspaper enquiredby telephone of the Duty Officer what the Post Office had to say about the article which they said would appear in the Daily Express the following morningalleging cable vetting. The reply was that the Post Office had no comment tomake.At about 12 midnight The Times pressed for comment and the reply wasto the effect that it was an offence to open or delay a postal packet except undera warrant signed by a Secretary of State and that it was assumed that similarprovisions applied in the case of telegrams or cables. When pressed further the Duty Officer said he could not possibly say what numbers of cables might,be involved.1st March, 1967.
On 17th February I heard from . . . that the Daily Express andthe Daily Mail had got hold of a story that the G.P.O. and the four privatecable companies furnished the Ministry of Defence with copies of overseastelegrams. After further consultation with . . . and with the security service I held an urgent meeting that afternoon with representatives of . . .to consider what line of action or comment should be taken. At this meetingit was decided that the Security Service, either directly or through . . .should brief Colonel Lohan to continue his efforts with the Daily Express tostifle the story by indicating that the subject came under the terms of the &apos; D &apos;notices, without giving Mr. Chapman Pincher any gratuitous information aboutthe actual interception of telegrams or the extent and purpose of this. It is clear from the minutes of this meeting that my intention was that Chapman Pinchershould be told that a story along the lines he envisaged would contravene the* D&apos; notice, and the conclusions of the meeting showed that this was agreed.2. I was myself in touch with Colonel Lohan by telephone on 18th February(Saturday) and 20th February in order to learn how the matter stood and todiscuss the line he was taking with the Daily Express. Before speaking to himon 20th February, I talked to ... in order to make sure that the advice givento Colonel Lohan was concerted.   I also consulted Mr. Greenhill.3. As a result of this, the general line of advice I gave to Colonel Lohan was(i) that he should do all he could to get Chapman Pincher to drop the story, which covered an area of activity falling under the &apos; D&apos; noticesof 1956 and 1961.(ii) .   .   .I was anxious that anything said to Mr. Chapman Pincher should not . . .4. There was obviously a difficulty for Colonel Lohan in that. ... To go into details with Mr. Chapman Pincher about why the story infringed this &apos; D&apos;notice thereby carried the danger of admitting the actual nature of the operation to him. ...5. I understood that Chapman Pincher was taking the line that the storyinvolved a large scale invasion of privacy and that it was therefore his duty inthe public interest to publish it. In order to counter this argument colonel lohan wished(i) to tell Chapman Pincher that the activity in question was properlyauthorised under the Official Secrets Act of 1920, and(ii) to indicate that what was involved was not a wholesale censorship, but was in fact extremely selective, and that in order to identify particularcommunications in which there was a national security interest some kind of sorting process was obviously necessary.I confirmed that if Colonel Lohan thought it would help to get Chapman Pincherto drop the story, he could use this line of argument at his discretion, providedthat he did not give away details of what was actually involved.6. As a premise to all this I understood the position to be that Colonel Lohanwas requesting the Press not to publish the story on &apos; D&apos; notice grounds, andthat the two &apos;D&apos; notices in question were those of 27th April, 1956, which covers secret intelligence or counter intelligence methods and activities, and of30th October, 1961, which covers the interception of communications. this seems to be borne out by Colonel Lohan&apos;s statement that he produced thesetwo &apos; D &apos; notices to Chapman Pincher on 20th February and indicated that hewas basing his arguments on them.   It also seems implicit in the very fact that^J) (To) Mr. D. A. GreenhillThe Daily Express and the &apos; D &apos; notices
Colonel Lohan, as the &apos; D&apos; notice authority, asked the Press not to publish the story. It is in fact Colonal Lohan&apos;s raison d&apos;etre to advise the Press on theapplication of &apos; D &apos; notices.7. I have in my own mind no doubt that the Daily Express realised throughoutthat in the view of H.M.G. the publication of their story would involve an infringement of the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure. All the evidence seems to showthat they had decided, well before either(i) Chapman Pincher told Colonel Lohan that the story would be runin the Glasgow edition ; or(ii) Sir Max Aitken told the Secretary of State that the story would bekilled,to set in train all the necessary arrangements to publish the story as a front pagespread in their London edition.(Signed)  C. T. E. Ewart-Biggs.23rd February, 1967.APPENDIX IV[not published]APPENDIX VSecurity Service action in briefing Colonel Lohan for his dealings with Chapman Pincher over &quot; Cable Vetting &quot;Following the meeting of officials on Friday, 17th February, at which it wasdecided that Colonel Lohan should be asked by the Security Service to try to stop the story on &apos; D&apos; notice grounds, Mr. . . . spoke to Colonel Lohanby telephone that evening at his house. Lohan then confirmed that Pincherhad agreed not to publish his story, pending a meeting with Lohan on the follow-ing Monday. The action already taken by Lohan with Pincher had apparentlyoriginated in a previous request telephoned to Lohan by . . . agreed to resumediscussions with Lohan on Monday morning over a scrambler telephone, andthen reported the above conversation to Ewart-Biggs of the Foreign Office.2. On Monday morning . . . spoke to Lohan again. He told him thatthe Foreign Office attached the greatest importance to killing the story and referred to the &apos; D &apos; notice of 27th April, 1956, and the &apos; D &apos; notice of 30thOctober, 1961. Lohan said that Ewart-Biggs had already been in touch withhim on the Saturday and had asked him to use the &apos; D &apos; notice of 30th October,1961 ; he had, however, also asked Lohan to keep off . * . and Lohan fore-saw difficulties in trying to conduct his conversation with Pincher if he wastied in this way. . . . concluded that if Lohan was to have a clear brieffor his meeting with Pincher, it needed to come from a single source. he therefore told Lohan that he would arrange for Ewart-Biggs to brief him direct and later spoke to Ewart-Biggs and arranged for him to do this. Subsequently,Lohan telephoned to ... and said that Ewart-Biggs had approved the explanation Lohan wished to be allowed to use with Pincher in dealing withthe activity which formed the basis of Pincher&apos;s story.3. . . . gave Lohan no further guidance on his dealings with Pincher.Their subsequent conversations consisted of reports from Lohan, from whichit initially appeared that the Express would not publish or, at the very least,would give Lohan an opportunity for further representations before they did so.4. Throughout the operation, . . . had no doubt that Lohan was basinghimself on the &apos; D &apos; notices and he was not aware that Pincher had claimed toLohan during their meeting on Monday that they did not apply.24th February, 1967.
Leakage of Information about the interception of Overseas TelegramsDiary of events on 20th FebruaryIn the afternoon of 20th February, I telephoned Colonel Lohan to ask whether he had any further news about this matter. He told me that he had seen Chapman Pincher over lunch and had convinced him not to use the story ;Pincher had said that he would refer to his editor. The Managing Editor ofthe Daily Mail had also said that he would see his Editor in Chief and adviseagainst publication.2. At about 6.15 p.m. Colonel Lohan reported to me that:(i) the Editor of the Daily Mail had definitely agreed not to publish the story ;(ii) Chapman Pincher had seen his Editor who had asked him to write the story so that the Editor could see what it looked like and consult thepaper&apos;s lawyers. Chapman Pincher did not think that the daily express would publish the story that evening, and undertook in any event to inform Colonel Lohan in advance. Colonel Lohan was thusconfident that he would have enough warning from Chapman Pincherto allow him to take action with the Editor if there was a prospect ofthe story being published ;(iii) Chapman Pincher had said that the informant, a student, had visitedhim again and had claimed to have given the story also to the ManchesterEvening News, an American Press Agency, and the Press Association.Colonel Lohan thought he could deal with the Press Association, but con-sidered that any approach to the Manchester Evening News might becounter-productive.3. At about 10 p.m. Mr. . . . (Security Service) telephoned to say thathe had heard from Colonel Lohan that the Daily Express were running the story in their Glasgow edition.4. I immediately telephoned to Mr. Greenhill and we agreed that he wouldtell the Secretary of State and suggest to him that he might get in touch with sir Max Aitken or the Editor of the Daily Express.5. I then spoke on the telephone with Colonel Lohan who confirmed thatChapman Pincher had told him that the Express were running the story. Hehad written the story on instructions from his Editor and had played it down.Colonel Lohan had talked to the Night Editor of the Daily Express havingbeen unable to obtain the Editor, Mr. Marks. The Night Editor had said thatthe story could not be stopped; it was anyway too late for this as the Glasgowedition would be going to press. Colonel Lohan told me he had promised the daily Mail when they undertook not to publish the story that he would let them know if the Daily Express published it. He had therefore felt obligedon his own initiative to tell the Daily Mail. When I questioned this he ex-plained that the Daily Mail would pick up the story anyway from the daily express.6. I telephoned the News Department Duty Officer to make certain he was aware of the agreed line in response to questions.7. At about 10.30 p.m. Mr. Greenhill telephoned to say that the Secretary ofState had spoken to the Daily Express who had agreed to kill the story.8. I at once telephoned to Colonel Lohan to tell him to let the Daily Mailknow that the Daily Express would not be publishing the story and that itwas imperative that the Daily Mail should refrain from using it themselves.9. Colonel Lohan telephoned a few minutes later to say that the Dail Mailhad agreed not to publish the story. He had told them only that the daily express would not now be carrying it.
10. I informed Mr. Greenhill. He told me that the Daily Express&apos;s condition for not publishing had been that they should be told the full story; we should therefore have to prepare a version for Colonel Lohan to give them.11. I informed ... of this development. ... I also informed the NewsDepartment Duty Officer (Mr. Maitland was not available), that the daily express had now undertaken not to publish the story.12. At about 11.25 p.m. Colonel Lohan telephoned to say that he had justlearnt from the Daily Mail that they had seen the London issue of the daily express which carried the story as a front page spread. I at once informedMr. Greenhill. I then telephoned Colonel Lohan and asked him to find out from the Daily Express what the position was.13. Mr. Greenhill telephoned shortly afterwards to say that he had heard from Mr. Greig. Mr. Marks, the Editor of the Daily Express, had said that hehad telephoned to Glasgow to find out what the story was and that the Expresswere running it because there was no &apos; D &apos; notice covering it. I confirmed toMr. Greenhill that the subject matter of the story fell clearly under the &apos; D&apos;notice issued in 1961 about the interception of communications ; and that colonel lohan, as the &apos; D&apos; notice authority, had asked the Daily Express not to use the story on &apos; D &apos; notice grounds.14. I informed .... Meanwhile spokesmen would be taking the agreedline that we never comment on stories of this kind. I also informed Mr.Maitland of News Department and Mr. . . . (Security Service).(Signed) C. T. E. Ewart-Biggs.list February, 1967.APPENDIX VII&apos; D&apos; noticesI returned from leave on 20th February and Mr. Ewart-Biggs informed me earlythat morning what action he had taken on the previous Friday and showed me the minute in which he had recorded the decisions of his meeting. I agreed withthe action that he had taken and asked him to keep me informed during the day.Late in the afternoon, he told me that Colonel Lohan had informed him about his lunch with Chapman Pincher. Lohan had said that he thought he had per-persuaded Chapman Pincher not to publish the story and that if, contrary to hisexpectation, the paper decided to publish we would be given a further opportunityto comment.2. About 7 p.m. that evening I saw the Secretary of State and told him what had happened during the day between Lohan and Pincher. The Secretary ofState suggested that he should then ring Max Aitken and ask for that story tobe excluded from the paper. I said that I thought it was better for the matter to be handled through the normal channels. The Secretary of State askedwhether I thought the story would be published that night. I replied that Lohanhad said he thought it unlikely and that in any case we should be given a further opportunity to comment.3. At about 10 p.m., Mr. Ewart-Biggs &apos;phoned me at my home to say thatthe Daily Express had decided to run the story and it would shortly be appearing in the Scottish edition. I rang up the Secretary of State at Mr. Grierson&apos;house and suggested that it might be useful if he now spoke to Sir Max Aitken.I repeated that I thought the story contravened the &apos; D &apos; notice and should be stopped. After about 20 minutes, the Secretary of State rang back to say thathe had spoken to Sir Max Aitken who had had the Editor of the paper with him.They had agreed to kill the story but would wish to know next day what thefacts of the case were. I then informed Mr. Ewart-Biggs and he told me thathe would tell Colonel Lohan.4. An hour or so later, Mr. Ewart-Biggs rang me to say that in fact the Expresswere running the story. I said that I thought that nothing more could be done inthe circumstances.
APPENDIX VIIIMinute by Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsDenis Greenhill rang me when I was dining with Ronald Grierson: the time Iguess was around 10 p.m. He told me that the Express were going to print a storyabout the interception of telegrams and he said this would be very bad for thenational interest. He also told me that the Daily Express had been told that thiswas the subject of a &apos; D &apos; notice. Being as I was then at a private house I couldnot use the Office machine. I therefore rang Sir Max Aitken at the Express. Thetime by then would be I guess about 10.20 p.m. I explained the situation to SirMax who said &quot; Derek Marks is by my side&quot;, told him why the &apos; D&apos; noticemachinery operated in this case and urged him not to print the story, whereuponhe said to me &quot; Very well I will kdl the story &quot;. At that point my conversationwith him ended. I was later telephoned and told that the story was not killed, was runnin, but there did not seem to be any point in going back to him again. Andfor the rest of the story I think you should pick up what Bill Greig has alreadyrecorded.22nd February, 1967.APPENDIX IX(To) Private secretary the Secretary of State should be aware of the final exchanges last night withthe Daily Express. Just before 1 a.m. Derek Marks, the editor, telephoned tosay that he now accepted that the cable-vetting story was covered by &apos; D &apos; notices,he would therefore take it out of the paper. Five minutes later he telephonedagain to say that the story was now appearing in other papers and, as the Expresscould not be put in the position of being the only paper without the story, he hadrescinded the order to take it out of the paper.2. He asked me to inform the Secretary of State that he could not accept thatthere had been any promise made by Sir Max Aitken earlier in the day.3. For the record I add the earlier exchanges between me and Derek Marks.My first understanding was that the story in question was a political one and I asked Marks what they were saying about the Foreign Secretary. He expressedgreat surprise, said there was nothing of any consequence about the foreign secretary and that he was puzzled by my enquiry. I asked if he knew that therehad been a conversation earlier in the day between the Secretary of State andSir Max Aitken, and he replied that there had been a misunderstanding about the cable-vetting story and a suggestion that it was covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice. Theyhad found this was incorrect and had combed the paper and the Scottish editionas well to make sure that there was no other story to which a &apos; D &apos; notice mightapply. After consulting the Secretary of State and Mr. Greenhill I gave Marksthe date of the two &apos; D&apos; notices but I impressed on him that the request forthe story to be killed was being made on the basis of the promise made bySir Max; He refused to agree that there had been a promise.5. About 1 o&apos;clock, Mr. Greig rang me to say that the Editor of the Expressmaintained that he had been told that no &apos; D &apos; notice applied. After speaking toMr. Ewart-Biggs, I then rang Colonel Lohan at his home who said that he had made it clear to Chapman Pincher that two &apos; D &apos; notices applied but that accordingto his instructions, he had not leant heavily on the 1961 &apos; D &apos; notice. I then &apos;phonedMr. Greig and told him what Lohan had said and suggested that he might wish totell the Secretary of State.D. A. Greenhill.21th February, 1967.
4. On the Secretary of State&apos;s instructions I &apos;phoned him a third time with ademand that he contact Sir Max and that the promise be kept. He said he couldnot agree that anything more was required of him. He added that had they beengiven proper information about the &apos; D&apos; notice earlier in the day the situation would never have arisen, the fault he said was entirely on the official side.5. His final two calls were as stated at the beginning of this minute.(signed) W. L. Greig.2lst February, 1967.A (iii)(GOVERNMENT SUBMISSION TO THE RADCLIFFE COMMITTEE)The &apos; D &apos; notice system and Possible Improvements to it in theLight of Recent EventsAt the time of the episode over the Daily Express article on &quot; cable vetting &quot;the &apos; D &apos; notice system remained in all essentials as described by the previousRadcliffe Committee in 1962.* There were sixteen &apos; D&apos; notices in force, the last of them issued in June, 1964. A review of them was in progress, with the objectof bringing them up to date, and improving their texts in the light of theexperience gained in applying them. The position reached was that the Depart-ments concerned and the Secretary of the Services Press and broadcasting committee had agreed on cancelling three of the Notices (not those involvedin the present case) and on revised versions of all but one of the remainder.The next step would be for the revised texts to be submitted to the ServicesPress and Broadcasting Committee for approval, and subsequent issue by theSecretary. The questions raised by the Daily Express episode are however wider than the matter of textual amendment of the &apos; D&apos; notices themselves, and donot arise from any obviously remediable deficiency in the wording of the two&apos; D &apos; notices in question. The texts of both these &apos; D &apos; notices have in fact been changed in the proposed revision to make them clearer and more specific, butthe proposed changes would not have affected the application of the two Noticesto the &quot; cable-vetting &quot; story. It is thus safe to assume that the same situation would have arisen if the new versions of the &apos; D&apos; notices had been in force at the time. That situation involved the working of the &apos; D &apos; notice systemitself, it was a case of breakdown in the co-operation and mutual understanding between the Press and the Government upon which the whole system depends.2. In the official view the Daily Express infringed and thus inflicted damageupon the &apos; D&apos; notice system by publishing the &quot; cable vetting &quot; story after theyhad been asked on &apos; D &apos; notice grounds not to do so. The subsequent action ofThe Spectator in publishing the texts of the two &apos; D&apos; notices was in a sensea graver blow to the system since it disregarded the essential principle that the&apos; D &apos; notices are intended as Private and Confidential communications.Infringement of the &apos; D &apos; notices3. There have of course been breaches of &apos; D&apos; notices before and there nodoubt will be again ; the system is not infallible because it is not enforceable.Technical or minor infringements, not involving any real harm to security andcommitted without consulting the Secretary, are fairly frequent. Recent exampleshave been the mention by name of a former Head of M.I. 6, and the appearanceon television of one of their former employees (the B.B.C. acknowledged andapologised for this transgression). Major infringements knowingly committed,and causing or arising from disagreement between newspapers and the official side, are very much more rare. The previous Radcliffe Committee tookcognizance of the difficulty over the Blake case in this connexion. Since then,the only major incident, apart from the present case, arose over the arrival in England in 1963 of the Russian defector, Dolnytsin, whose whereabouts the* Security Procedures in the Public Service. Cmnd. 1681 of April 1962, Chapter 9.
security authorities wished to keep secret. The Secretary of the Services press and Broadcasting Committee sent out a Private and Confidential message asking that the details should not be published but this was disregarded by the Daily Telegraph apparently on the grounds that they had obtained the information from a foreign source, and also that the disclosure of Dolnytsin&apos;s name in a&apos; D&apos; notice circulated on the Press Association^ tape removed any justification for withholding it.4. On the positive side the &apos; D&apos; notice system undoubtedly serves its purposewell on many more occasions than it is infringed. Defence, intelligence, and security information which needs to be concealed in the national interest, hasbeen effectively kept out of the Press both through editors themselves following the guidance of the &apos; D &apos; notices and through advice given by the secretary in cases of doubt. Only very rarely has a request not to publish from theSecretary been disregarded, as in the present case; the occasions on which hisintervention has been successful have been numerous. The greatest strain ofcourse falls upon the system when there is a sensational story, when more thanone newspaper has it, or when there can be said to be an aspect of duty to thepublic in publishing it. The &quot; cable vetting &quot; story combined all these features.5. With each infringement of the system, and given the present popular cultin intelligence and security matters, the area of secrecy protected by the &apos; D&apos;notice procedure is progressively eroded ; but a great deal remains that stillrequires protection. The system can still serve to keep the erosion to theedges and thus help in ensuring that the really sensitive material at the centreremains concealed. Most of the Press seems willing to give their co-operation to the system, which could not of course survive without it. Press criticismin the recent episode has been directed more! to the question whether the system should have been invoked in this case rather than against the system itself.Nor does any alternative to the present system seem feasible. The only other possibilities would be on one hand to give the &apos; D&apos; notices, or some equivalent of them, the force of law ; or on the other to dismantle the system altogetherand to rely on the sanction of the Official Secrets Acts and on tight security to keep classified information out of the Press. The first of these courses wouldbe a long step towards censorship and would be unacceptable in this countryin peace time and unwelcome to the official side. The second would be impracticable. It is true that one function of a &apos; D&apos; notice is to provideeditors with some guidance about the areas in which they might risk liability under the Official Secrets Act. But by no means all the material whose publica-tion could harm the national interest would or could form a basis for prosecution.Nor is the provenance of such information always, or even often, official. TheOfficial Secrets Acts would thus not in themselves provide the necessary guidanceor deterrence to editors, and the most elaborate security precautions would not prevent the Press occasionally acquiring secret information^ from non-official sources (though it may be assumed that officials will now be doubly reticent intheir dealings with members of the Press who purport to &quot; specialise&quot; inintelligence and security matters). If the present infringement can be cleared up and put aside and a basis of confidence and mutual co-operation re-established between the official and Press sides, there is no reason why the system should not continue broadly as it is. Certain changes designed to improve the workingof it can be considered, but the essential basis of it is not amenable to change.It is by its nature imperfect, but it remains a great deal better than nothing.The Publication of the &apos; D &apos; notices6. The conduct of The Spectator in publishing the &apos; D &apos; notices has seriousimplications for the system. The Spectator have since sought to justify their action on the grounds first that the &apos; D &apos; notices had not been issued to them,and secondly that the two notices in question were general in content and didnot themselves contain information it would be damaging to national security to reveal*.   These arguments seem open to doubt.   It is understood that the* The Spectator of 10th March, 1967.
evidence of the Secretary of the Services Press and Broadcasting Committee andof his Assistant is that(i) The Spectator were in fact on the list of those receiving &apos; D &apos; notices ;(ii) in this context the previous editor had confirmed the address of the newspaper and notified the Secretary of the change of editorship;(iii) when The Spectators representative visited the Secretary and wished tosee the &apos; D &apos; notices, he asserted that The Spectator had lost their copiesand was specifically warned both by Colonel Lohan and his Assistantthat the &apos; D &apos; notices should not be published.7. The two &apos; D &apos; notices certainly contain matter which there was need toprotect on security grounds. That of 1956 referred for example to the natureof M.I.6&apos;s work, and that of 1961 to the interception of communications forsecret intelligence purposes. The Spectator themselves bowdlerised the text ofthe 1956 &apos; D&apos; notice by omitting a reference to . . . presumably because they thought that otherwise they might be sailing too close to the Official Secrets Act.The point here is that editors are not and should not be in a position to judge whether or not a &apos; D &apos; notice or any part of it is fit for publication. &apos; D &apos; noticesare communicated to them in confidence. Of the two &apos; D &apos; notices in question,one was marked &quot; Secret&quot; and the other &quot; Private and Confidential&quot;, a fact the Spectator did not mention in reproducing the texts. This is intrinsicto the &apos; D &apos; notice system. If notices are to be intended for publication theywould have to be entirely recast in such general terms that they would be offer less use and the system would probably become unworkable. If it is tocontinue satisfactorily, therefore, there will need to be some confirmationfrom the Press side that the &apos; D &apos; notices will be treated as confidential documents and that individual &apos; D &apos; notices will not be published, in whole or in part.The Role of the Secretary8. In the recent episode, Mr. Chapman Pincher of the Daily Express arguedwith the Secretary of the Services Press and Broadcasting Committee that the&apos; D &apos; notice did not apply to his story. He also contended that the story dealtwith an encroachment upon the privacy of the citizen and that it was therefore the duty of his newspaper to publish it. These two arguments touch upon an issue which is fundamental to the &apos; D &apos; notice system. On one hand, thePress are not always in a position to judge for themselves whether a particularstory falls under the &apos; D &apos; notice. To decide this it is often necessary to know,as it was in the present case, the real nature of the activity to which the storyrelates and this cannot always be explained to the Press without giving awayinformation that should not be revealed. On the other hand, the Press haveto be satisfied that they are not being asked to suppress a story merely because it would be embarrassing or inconvenient to the Government to have it published.The problem may thus be to persuade a newspaper that their story refers to asecret activity which it would be harmful to the national interest to disclose,without at the same time admitting to them exactly what the nature and theextent of the secret activity is. It is here that the question of confidence arises.The newspaper must be satisfied that the Secretary of the Committee has informedhimself on the official side about the issues at stake and is in his turn satisfiedthat it is a matter of national security.9. The role of the Secretary is thus of great importance. The committee itself meets only rarely and then mainly to consider the actual content of the&apos; D &apos; notices. It falls to the Secretary to work the system and an essential partof this is to provide a service of advice to editors about whether any particularpiece of copy is covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice or not. It follows that if he is to speak authoritatively to the Press the Secretary himself must be properlyinformed. He should not only be able to receive full briefing from the Depart-ment concerned when a case arises, but he should also have some backgroundknowledge of secret matters so that when consulted by the Press he will already have an idea of what may be involved.
10. It has been suggested that the Secretary&apos;s status might be enhanced if he were made a full member of the Committee. The disadvantage in this is thathis important role in the &apos; D&apos; notice system is sui generis, and to make him amember of the Committee itself might tend to limit or obscure his functionas a bridge between the official and non-official sides of the Committee and asthe purveyor of official advice to the Press. Though he is the servant of theCommittee, he also has official connections, and it might in fact be damaging to the working of the system, which is essentially pragmatic, if he were to begiven a defined status as a member of the Committee.Channel of Advice to the Secretary11. In the present case the official advice given to Colonel Lohan was con-certed by inter-Departmental consultation, but representatives of the various departments concerned, . . . were in touch with him throughout the episode,and this may have been confusing to him and less effective than if he hadreceived guidance from only one source. To avoid any possible confusion orinconsistency in briefing the Secretary from the official side in future, it might thus be best if guidance were given to him through a single channel in each case.This would normally be the Department primarily concerned in the particular case, and this Department would be responsible for consulting any others con-cerned and concerting an agreed fine of advice. ... At the same time thequestion whether or not a &apos; D &apos; notice is to be invoked on larger issues sometimeshas policy implications about which other Departments need to be consulted.They should therefore be brought into the matter whenever any case that mighthave political implications arises, and in particularly delicate cases it may be useful for the Home Office or Foreign Office to act as the channel of guidance.Inter-Departmental consultation may be necessary but it should not however bedifficult to decide at the outset on each occasion which will be the department that will deal with the Secretary. At the same time, the advice given to himshould wherever possible be in writing, though because of the time factor this is less likely to be feasible in cases involving newspaper stories than in those oflonger term publications.A System of Appeal12. Where as in this case a newspaper is reluctant to accept the advice of theSecretary and contends that the &apos; D &apos; notice does not apply, there should ifpossible be some system which would allow time and opportunity for furtherconsideration and persuasion. Colonel Lohan has himself suggested that thereshould be some form of &quot; stop &quot; procedure which would allow a &quot; Referee Sub-Commitee &quot; of official and Press representatives to judge the matter. The Com-mittee of Enquiry will no doubt wish to pursue these suggestions. A &quot; stop &quot;procedure would certainly be helpful in allowing more time in Which to try to convince the newspaper, perhaps at a higher level, not to publish. But giventhe acute competition between newspapers for both exclusiveness and immediacy,it seems doubtful whether in many cases a &quot; stop &quot; would be workable or accept-able in practice. The idea of a Referee Committee is open to two difficulties first, Press representatives are disinclined to sit in judgment upon one another(as the resignation of the Editor of the Daily Mirror from the Services Press and broadcasting Committee showed); secondly, as has already been seen, the questionwhether a &apos; D&apos; notice applies or not to a particular story often involves issuesthat cannot be disclosed to the Press side and are thus not susceptible to a negotiation of this kind. What seems to be required is that in the event of disagreement between the Secretary and the newspapers there should be a possi-bility of immediate reference to higher authority, before it is too late. It could perhaps be agreed with the Press side that in these circumstances the view ofthe Chairman of the Committee, who is a senior official, should be taken before a decision to publish is made, and that he might consult with a representative ofthe unofficial side of the Committee whom he could take to some extent at leastinto his confidence about the true issues at stake. This representative wouldhave to be someone in whose opinion editors would have confidence but shouldnot be directly connected with a newspaper himself.  The difficulty in all this
would however be to set these consultations in motion with sufficient speed toprevent the story appearing. In many cases the best that might be hoped wouldbe that the Secretary should immediately refer any disagreement to the Chairmanof the Committee who would then do his best to clear the matter up, either inconsultation with a representative of the unofficial side of the Committee, or by direct approach to the Editor of the newspaper concerned, or both.The Composition of the Committee13. The official representatives on the Services Press and Broadcasting Com-mittee are at present the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Defence whois the Chairman, the Permanent Under-Secretaries of the three Services Depart-ments, and the Permanent Secretary of the Aviation Division of the Ministry of technology. This reflects the original concept whereby the &apos; D&apos; notices were described as covering naval, military and air matters*. It has come to beaccepted however that the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure covers also security and intelli-gence matters which do not directly involve the Service Departments. &quot; cable vetting &quot; was indeed a case in point. It is suggested therefore that, under theChairmanship of the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Defence, theofficial side should include representatives more directly concerned with these activities, such as a Deputy Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office. The HomeSecretary&apos;s interest could be represented by the Permanent Under-Secretary at theHome Office. The numbers on the official side could be kept to their present levelif these two new representatives were to replace two of the Permanent Under-Secretaries of the Service Departments.14. There is at present no single representative on the unofficial side of theCommittee who could serve as a point of contact for the Chairman in case ofemergency (see paragraph 12 above), or on matters of procedure. During theyears when Admiral Thomson was Secretary of the Committee, Mr. NormanRobson, one of the two Newspaper Society representatives, frequently acted inan emergency as the representative of the Press side of the Committee, though he had no formal standing as such. He has however since retired from theCommittee. It is suggested therefore that an unofficial member of the Com-mittee might fill this role, perhaps in the capacity of Vice-Chairman. For thereasons already indicated, he should not himself be directly connected with a newspaper, broadcasting service, or publishing house, but he should be someonein whose judgment editors would have confidence.Summary of Recommendations15. (i) It should be clearly understood and confirmed on the Press side thatthe &apos; D &apos; notices are not for publication.  (Paragraph 2 above.)(ii) Official guidance should be given to the Secretary through the singlechannel of the Department primarily concerned, and wherever possible thisguidance should be in writing.   (Paragraph 11.) &quot;*(iii) There should be provision that where there is disagreement between theSecretary and a newspaper over the publication of an item, the matter shouldbe referred to the Chairman of the Committee so that he may have an oppor-tunity of discussing it with a representative of the unofficial side of the Com-mittee or with the Editor of the newspaper concerned, or both, before the itemis published.   (Paragraph 12.)(iv) A Deputy Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office and the permanent under-Secretary of the Home Office should be official members of the Com-mittee in place of two of the Service Permanent Under-Secretaries. (Paragraph13.)(v) A non-official member of the Committee should be chosen as Vice-Chairman, who could serve as a point of consultation for the Chairman in emer-gencies or on points of procedure.

B (i)Aide Memoire (by Colonel Lohan)Subject: The Daily Express front page article headed &quot; Cable Vetting Sensation &quot;published on Tuesday, 21st February, 1967 background and action taken.introduction. For the last three months or so the Newspaper world had become over-excited and over-sensitive about the topics of telephone tapping and interferencewith mail. Rightly or wrongly Fleet Street felt persecuted and suspicious. the atmosphere was ripe for an explosive protest about these issues.Long standing weaknesses of &apos;D&apos; notice system. Experience (from 1964 onwards) soon showed that two matters requiredurgent action ; one, the system of records and filing needed overhauling (of2,000 entries 50 per cent, were inaccurate and there were no files, as such,for correspondence); the other, the need to re-write all &apos; D &apos; notices so as toavoid legalistic argument over words.3. Putting the records on a sound footing required months of research anda general request for all users of notices to register.  The work continues.4. In August, 1964, permission was given to begin revising the notices; butit was not until April, 1965, that an Interdepartmental Working Party was setup to review &apos; D&apos; notice material. The revision is now complete except forone disputed passage in the notice. ...5. By way of illustration, copies are attached* of examples of old noticestogether with their newly drafted equivalents (not yet approved by the Com-mittee); the specific examples chosen are the &apos; D&apos; notices of 27th April, 1956,and 30th October, 196.1, both of which relate to the case under consideration.Breaches of &apos; D &apos; notices6. Since May, 1962, there have been only two major &apos; D&apos; notice upsets (thatdated 11th July, 1963, concerning Anotoli Donytsin, the Russian defector, andthe present case). Since August, 1963, there have been 20 technical breaches of&apos; D&apos; notices, and in five of these cases each newspaper concerned was completelyexonerated. The average, therefore, is five cases a year nearly all of a minorcharacter.7. It would be impossible to place a quantitative value on the times when thePress etc. have co-operated to prevent breaches of the notices.Events immediately prior to publication8. On the afternoon of Thursday, 16th February, Chapman Pincher of the daily Express telephoned me in my office. He asked me if there was a &apos; D &apos;notice that covered the interception of G.P.O. telegrams by the Ministry ofDefence. I replied that there was not. I asked him to check his story withthe M.O.D. and come back to me.9. On the next day (Friday) after discussions with ... I realised that there wasa good deal more to Pincher&apos;s story than was first apparent.10. I also learned that Pincher&apos;s informant had given the same story to the daily Mail and to Sennet, the magazine of the London School of Economics.I decided the magazine did not need my immediate attention since its publicationdate was some days off. The Daily Mail, in the person of their ManagingEditor, Mr. Matthewman, readily agreed to suspend action on the story untilI had a chance to plead in person.11. Repeated efforts to reach Pincher failed and I did not succeed in gettingin touch with him until late on Sunday night.  He readily agreed to defer action* not published.
until we met next day (I deduce he could not have had an overriding interestin the story or he would have been ready to do a &quot; Sunday for Monday &quot;, whichis characteristic of him).12. Pincher and I met for lunch on Monday, 20th February. As soon as I satdown I produced from my pocket the &apos; D&apos; notices of 27th April, 1956, and 30thOctober, 1961. I pointed out a section in each of them saying that they wouldbe the basis of our talk.13. At some early stage in the discussion Pincher said, apropos the two &apos;D&apos;notices, &quot; You can put them away ; I know them off by heart&quot;. I admitted Iknew them too and added &quot; All right, let us put them aside and argue about basicissues &quot;.14. It is not pedantry or hairsplitting that compels me to emphasise theexpression I used. Pincher is entitled to say the actual &apos; D &apos; notices had in hisopinion no relevance; but it is clear in my mind that the whole conversation wasconducted within the broad meaning and spirit of the notices. I put the noticesaside since, had I not done so, further temperate and intelligible conversationwould have been impossible. In any circumstances I never intended that thetwo notices should be anything but a point of reference, since I was to argue thatit was not in the public interest to publish the information about cable and telegramvetting, per se.The arguments deployed15. I was prepared to concede that the story might have overtones of political embarrassment but I stressed that this aspect diminished to insignificance whencompared with the needs of security. I explained that the power to scrutinisecables and telegams was derived from the O.S.A. by virtue of a warrant andhad been exercised continuously over many years. I said the process was afruitful source of information required for the defence of the Realm; like mostoperations of an intelligence nature, publicity could do incalculable harm to a specific and contemporary line of enquiry. I pointed out the stupidity of claiming that the process was one of mere prying or censoring, since it would be impossibleto read and note the text of every cable or telegram and messages were notdelayed. I suggested that what was being looked for was patterns in addressing,signatures and, in some cases, the text e.g. a search might disclose a plain languagecode used by an enemy agent. I drew attention to the clear practical need forcollection from many points and subsequent centralised scrutiny.16. It was argued against me by Pincher that the interception of cables andtelegrams was absolutely parallel with telephone tapping and opening mail and could not be a &quot; secret intelligence method &quot;. He said the &apos; D &apos; notice of 27thApril, 1956, had been modified at his insistence to exclude telephone tapping.(This is so; a &apos;D&apos; notice dated 31st October, 1957, stated that there was no need to maintain secrecy about telephone tapping except that identities were notto be disclosed in particular security cases.) *17. I contested Pincher&apos;s argument on the grounds that a different mediumwas being examined and that the intelligence procedure or method in this instancebore no relation to telephone tapping, which was specific rather than general.18. Pincher was particularly angry about what he claimed was interferencewith individual privacy and the fact that I would not deny that newspaper&quot; Service &quot; messages were not excluded. He persisted in his contention that the interception was not of long standing.19. At the end of our discussion I was reasonably sure I had convincedPincher. We parted with good feeling and Pincher said he would representmy case in all fairness to his Editor.Action subsequent to meeting with Pincher20. After lunch I saw Mr. Matthewman in his office together with AngusMacpherson, Defence correspondent of the Daily Mail.   I used very similar
arguments to those I had used with Pincher. They agreed they would not publish,( j but wanted some more assurance about the intention of the Daily Express. I^Lw said I had every reason to believe the Daily Express would not publish; but inthe event of the Daily Express telling me they were going to publish, I would let the Daily Mail know as soon as I could.21. At about 5.30 p.m. Pincher telephoned to say there had been a preliminary meeting with his Editor and the Daily Express lawyers and he, Pincher, hadbeen instructed to write the story so that everyone would have a clear ideawhat it was all about. He said the lawyers&apos; attitude was that there seemedno bar to publication since the informant was not subject to the O.S.A. in this instance and in their opinion the &apos; D &apos; notices had no relevance. He also asked me if he could send to collect copies of the two &apos; D &apos; notices [that had beenunder discussion] because the Daily Express could not readily find their copies.I agreed to this and hold a receipt for the two copies. He also added that he wished he had known of Section 4 of the O.S.A. (1920) before because it wasa story in itself. He asked me to excuse his breaking off the conversationbecause he wanted to get on with his writing.22. Just before 6.30 p.m. I again telephoned Pincher to enquire if a decisionhad been made. He said it had not. He added that he had seen the informantagain who had said he had given the same story to the Manchester Evening news and some Foreign Agencies. Pincher gave me the impression he was nowworried. I asked him if he would like me to see Derek Marks, the Editor, buthe said no, it was not necessary.23. At about 6.40 p.m. I again telephoned Pincher to ask if there was anyresult from the Editorial conference; he said there was not. I reminded him that my office telephone number changed after 6.30 p.m.23a. By now I thought it unlikely that the Daily Express would publish that night, because I expected that as usual Pincher would clear the text of his storywith me before going to print and it was now getting late.24. I left my office just after 7 p.m. to go to the Ministry of Defence toreport to my Chairman, Sir James Dunnett (I had warned his office in the afternoon that I might want to see him). I told Sir James that there had been no difficulty in holding the Daily Mail and I had reason to believe the daily express would not publish, but the situation was dicey and an editorial decision was still awaited.25. I made arrangements for Mrs. Marshall, the Assistant Secretary, to hold the office and in the event of Pincher telephoning to ask the Editor directly fora further postponement. I asked my wife to get in touch with Mrs. Marshallshould Pincher telephone my home before my return.26. Pincher did not telephone me until 9.40 p.m. (since the Daily Express is&quot; off stone &quot; just before 9.30 p.m. as a rule, I was till that moment even moreconvinced that publication had been postponed); he said in a very tired voice&quot;You have lost. The Editor and the lawyers decided against you. I did mybest&quot;.27. I immediately telephoned the Daily Express and asked for Derek Marks,the Editor. I got the Night Editor (I think Peter Johnson); he said Derek Markswas en route between places and could not be contacted. I asked the NightEditor if he had authority to stop the story. He said he had not because it was now rolling for the Glasgow editions. I asked him to get Derek Marks to telephone me as soon as possible.28. I straight away telephoned ... of the Security Service and arranged for him to tell Ewart-Biggs of the Foreign Office while I informed ... ofthe turn of events.29. I then telephoned the Daily Mail as promised. A little later, on advice from Ewart-Biggs, I asked them to withhold publication on the grounds thatthe Daily Express had promised the Foreign Office they would stop the story.
30. Some time about 10.30 p.m. Arthur Brittenden, Editor of the Daily Mail,telephoned to say the Daily Express first editions had given splash treatment tothe story. I agreed in the circumstances that he could follow (a little later the Daily Mail read all the text of their story over to me and made somealterations at my request).31. I telephoned all concerned once again.32. Some time after midnight I spoke to Derek Marks. During this con-versation I learned it had been represented that I had considered the &apos; D &apos; noticesto have no relevance. For the first time I became angry and asked Marks why he thought I had brought notices along when I met Chapman Pincher.33. Later, at about 2 a.m. on Tuesday morning, Marks again telephoned me and said the Foreign Office had represented that &apos; D &apos; notices were being contra-intervened and expected him to stop the story. I replied that he should ask the ForeignOffice to telephone me immediately, because to stop the story after two editions,and after other newspapers had picked it up would bring about a ridiculoussituation. The harm to security had already been done.Action after the Prime Ministers statement34. On Tuesday, at about 4.30 p.m., after the Prime Minister made his state-ment in the House about &apos; D &apos; notices, Chapman Pincher telephoned me in greatexcitement. He began by saying &quot; Let us get this straight, since we do not want to go on calling one another names. Am I not right when I say you agreed with me that the &apos; D&apos; notices did not apply to our story? &quot; I replied &quot; As Ihave already told your Editor early this morning, at the beginning of our con-versation at lunch time on Monday I produced the two relevant &apos; D&apos; noticesand pointed out a section in each on which I would base my arguments. Youabsolutely rejected the notice dealing with methods of our Intelligence services on the grounds that interference with cables and telegrams was on an absoluteparallel with telephone tapping. You then rejected the next point about inter-ception of foreign communications in that it was utterly irrelevant.&quot;35. Pincher said &quot; When I first telephoned you about this story on Thursday,you told me that the &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply. Do you agree? I said &quot; Yes &quot;.&quot; Your story was that G.P.O. telegrams were collected by the Ministry of defence and I agreed the notices did not mention this and you should ring the M.O.D.and come back to me.&quot;36. Chapman Pincher again asked me to agree that the &apos; D &apos; notices were not relevant to his story of Monday. I told him not to quibble. I said &quot; You know what happened. I took the notices out of my pocket and after you had rejectedthem I said &apos; All right, let us put them aside and argue about the basic issues.&apos;You must agree that I then went on to argue at great length why it was not inthe public interest to publish your story.&quot;37. Pincher agreed with my version of events and then told me that the daily express would refute the Prime Ministers allegation that-they had broken the&apos; D&apos; notices. I felt it useless to argue any more, since Pincher was absolutelyfirm in his own mind that the notices had no relevance whatsoever and the factthat I had suggested, during conversation, that they should be put aside in order not to hold up discussions was taken to mean that I, myself, had admitted thatthey had no relevance.38. I did, however, once again tell him that all my arguments, and he wellknew it, were conducted in the spirit of the &apos; D&apos; notices and could have no other basis.Action after Daily Express rebuts Prime Minister39. After the Wednesday meeting at the M.O.D. in Sir James Dunnett&apos;s office,I went to see Derek Marks. I asked him if things would have been differenthad I seen him in the first place.   He assured me I was right to have gone to
Pincher, since in any case he would have asked me to treat with him. I then told him nothing would divert me from holding to the line that, although I put thenotices aside in order to get on with business, I was convinced beyond shadow of doubt that I acted throughout in the spirit of the accepted &apos; D &apos; notice procedure ;in this spirit I made my plea to Pincher that it was not in the public interest to publish the story about the scrutiny of cables and telegrams. What other righthad I to intervene?Consultation and briefing40. Throughout there was close discussion and exchanges with . . . and theForeign Office. At all times all recognised there was a danger that if . . . was told, a newspaper might use the whole truth to improve its story . . . Equally,not too much emphasis could be placed on the &apos; D&apos; notice of 30th October, 1961,for this might lead a newspaper to a dangerous half-truth, or point the story ina dangerous direction. I said I felt I could hold the situation without too muchreliance on the use of specific clauses in the notices, although it was accepted thatthey had relevance. I had considered two other courses of action but rejectedthem as impracticable; one was to issue a general warning through P.A., but this might have angered the newspapers who already had the story thus inciting themto print; the other was to issue a special &apos; D&apos; notice with the concurrence of press members, but this action, even if it had succeeded, would still have angeredthe particular newspapers and brought the Committee, as such, into the conflict,in my view unnecessarily.Lessons to be learned41. It seems clear that a definite voluntary &quot; Stop &quot; procedure must be intro-duced. This might apply for a period of 24 or 48 hours according to circum-stances. Perhaps if the recommendation of the Radcliffe Report (Cmnd. 1681,Chapter 9, paragraph 142) was implemented and the Secretary made a full memberof the Committee, he could himself convene a Referee Sub-Committee, preferablychaired by a Press member. The Secretary would represent the Official side and could quickly introduce other Officials as appropriate from the Departments con-cerned, without having to bring in Official members of the Committee who are atPermanent Secretary level, who may not be available at short notice and whowould have to be briefed with consequent loss of time. Speed would be essential in convening the Sub-Committee.42. The Referee Sub-Committee should preferably be small (a quorum of three)and the Chairman taken by rota or from the Press organisation most concerned(N.P.A., Newspaper Society, Periodical Proprietors Association etc.), whicheverwas most equitable. The Referee Sub-Committee would decide on the degree of&quot; Stop &quot; and during the breathing space obtained examine the merits of each particular case.43. It is not realised what pressures there can be on the Secretary and hisAssistant, who make up the entire office. On that Monday (20th February therewere two other matters requiring urgent action well outside normal routine. Theadministrative capability of the Secretary&apos;s office ought rightly to be improved by full time clerical assistance.44. For what it is worth, my experience with the Committee&apos;s Press side andthe attitude of the Press in general to it has shown clearly that the description of the system given in Chapter 9 of the Report &quot; Security Procedure in the PublicService&quot; (Cmnd. 1681) is still completely valid and, indeed, has become the operative terms of reference for the Committee&apos;s work.L. G. Lohan,Secretary of the Committee.1st March, 1967.Room 146,Shell Mex House,Strand, London, W.C.2.
B (ii)(To) Chairman : Services, Press and Broadcasting CommitteeOn Tuesday, 21st February at approximately 4.30 p.m. Chapman Pincher of the daily Express telephoned me and read the P.A. release on the Prime ministers statement in the House of Commons about his paper&apos;s story of that morning oninterference with cables and telegrams.2. He began by saying &quot; Let us get this straight, since we do not want to go oncalling one another names. Am I not right when I say you agreed with me thatthe &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply to our story? &quot; I replied &quot; As I have already toldyour Editor early this morning, at the beginning of our conversation at lunch time on Monday I produced the two relevant &apos; D&apos; notices and pointed out a section in each on which I would base my arguments. You absolutely rejected the &apos; D &apos;notice dealing with method (*) of our intelligence Services on the grounds that theinterference with cables and telegrams were on an absolute parallel with telephone tapping (where the &apos; D &apos; notices do not apply with the exception of mentioning thename of a specific person who is under surveillance). You then utterly rejected the next point about interception of foreign communications in that it was utterlyirrelevant.&quot;3. Pincher said &quot; When I first telephoned you about this story on Thursday, youtold me that the &apos;D&apos; notices did not apply. Do you agree?&quot;. I said &quot;Yes.Your story was that G.P.O. telegrams were collected by the Ministry of defence and I agreed the &apos; D &apos; notices did not mention this and you should ring the M.O.D.and come back to me &quot;.4. Chapman Pincher again asked me to agree that the &apos; D&apos; notices were not relevant to his story of Monday. I asked him not to quibble. I said &quot; You know what happened. I took the &apos; D&apos; notices out of my pocket and after you had rejected them I said &apos; All right, let us put them aside and argue about the basicissues.&apos; You must agree that I then went on to argue at great length why it wasnot in the public interest to publish your story &quot;.5. Pincher agreed with my version of events and then told me that the daily express would refute the P.M.&apos;s allegation that they had broken the &apos; D &apos; notices.I felt it useless to argue any more, since Pincher was absolutely firm in his ownmind that the &apos; D&apos; notices had no relevance whatsoever and the fact that I had suggested, during conversation, that they should be put aside in order not to holdup discussion was taken to mean that I, myself, had admitted that the &apos; D &apos; noticeshad no relevance.6. I did, however, once again tell him that all my arguments, and he well knewit, were conducted in the spirit of the &apos; D &apos; notices and could have had no other basis. &apos;*Secretary.22nd February, 1967.Shell Mex House,W.C.2.(To) Chairman : Services, Press and Broadcasting CommitteeIn addition to giving you a specific explanation about whether or not&apos; D &apos; noticescould be applied in the case of the Daily Express article &quot; Cable Vetting Sensa-tion &quot; of Tuesday, February 21st, you asked me to comment, point by point, onChapman Pincher&apos;s article in the Daily Express of Wednesday, February 22nd.Point 1(Action when story first received by the Daily Express.) Chapman Pincher waspassed a story received from an informant on or about Thursday, 16th February.He was not in possession of the full facts. It is true that he telephoned me to ask* sic.
if there was a &apos; D&apos; notice which covered the interception of G.P.O. telegrams bythe Ministry of Defence. I said there was not. But I did ask him to consult theMinistry of Defence and come back to me before he continued with the story.On Friday, after discussions with ... I realised that there was a good deal more to Chapman Pincher&apos;s story than was first apparent. I tried to get in touchwith Pincher, but was unsuccessful.On the same day, I learned that Chapman Pincher&apos;s informant had also been to the Daily Mail and to Sennet, the magazine of the London School of Economics(I decided it did not need my immediate attention).I had no difficulty whatsoever in persuading the Daily Mail to hold this storyuntil I could talk to them in person.Point 2(Pincher&apos;s next talk with me.) I did manage to get in touch with chapman pincher latish on Sunday night and I asked him to withhold any action on his storyuntil I could talk to Mm in person, since matters of national security were at stake.Without much difficulty, I got him to agree to this.Point 3(The &apos; D &apos; notices are introduced.) While talking to Chapman Pincher on sunday, we had agreed that probably the best way to do business was over lunchon Monday. He accurately reports that I produced two notices &quot; that could con-conceivably be relevant-those dated 27th April, 1956 and 30th October, 1961 &quot;. Ihave fully reported on this in a separate minute to you. What Chapman Pinchersays is a distortion of what happened; I did put the &apos; D &apos; notices aside, since to argue about them in particular would only impede progress. I must emphasiseonce again that although I decided to put aside the &apos; D &apos; notices in order toaMow our talks to go on, Chapman Pincher could have been under no misapprehension-hension whatsoever that the conversation that ensued was entirely in the spiritof the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure (and of a confidential nature).Point 4(I argue that the article should not be published.) Of course I used all my powers of persuasion ; this was what the meeting was about. At the endof the luncheon Chapman Pincher admitted that he thought I had convincedhim that it was against public interest to publish the article. He promised that he would faithfully represent my point of view to his Editor.Point 5(Decision to publish left to Editor.) What he says her,e is quite accurate,except that he told me that it was he and the lawyer who thought that neitherthe &apos; D &apos; notices nor the Official Secrets Act were involved. He said that hisEditor had asked him to write the story so that it could be looked at at anEditorial conference which would include the Daily Express lawyers. I wasunder no illusion that I was to be consulted further should they decide to publish.At 6.40 p.m. on Monday, I telephoned Chapman Pincher to ask if therehad been any result from the Editorial conference; he said there had notbeen. I reminded him that my telephone number changed after 6.30 p.m. and confirmed that he knew it.At about 7 o&apos;clock, I had heard nothing further from the Daily Express.I decided that I ought to let you, my Chairman, have a progress report (Ihad already warned your office earlier in the day that I might need to do this).  In essence, what I reported to you was that:(i) there was no difficulty in holding the Daily Mail ;(ii) I had reason to believe that the Daily Express would not publish, butthe situation was dicey and was awaiting an editorial decision.
Point 6(The Editorial Meeting.) I have no comment on this, since it relates entirely to the inner workings of the Daily Express.Point 7(I am told the Daily Express have decided to publish.) I had made every possible administrative arrangement to cover my absence from my office in theevent of Chapman Pincher telephoning to say that a decision had gone againstme. I arranged that the Editor (Derek Marks) should be telephoned and askedto hold up publishing until I had the opportunity of talking to him personally.In fact, Chapman Pincher telephoned me at my home at approximately 9.40 p.m.I question very much Chapman Pincher&apos;s contention that he had telephoned me&quot; as soon as possible &quot;. As soon as Chapman Pincher had told me that theywere going to publish, I immediately telephoned Derek Marks. I could not get hold of Marks, but I spoke to the Night Editor, who told me he could do nothing in the matter since the presses were already rolling and the Glasgowedition would carry the story. It is nonsensical for Pincher to say he tele-phoned me in order that I might warn other newspapers, because he quiteobviously telephoned me as late as possible so that I could not warn othernewspapers before they went to press with their first editions.Point 8(Other attempts to stop publishing.) I think this is true. The foreign secretary had been on to the Proprietor at about 10 p.m.; later the ForeignOffice were in touch with Derek Marks and told him that in their opinion hewas contravening the &apos; D&apos; notices and that he should withdraw the storyimmediately. When Marks telephoned me about this (about 2 a.m. Tuesday),I said he must get on to whoever it was he had spoken to in the Foreign Officeand ask them to ring me (since to have the story pulled out at that stage wouldhave made the whole situation untenable and given greater emphasis to the storythan it merited).You ought to know that I kept . . . appraised of every step I had taken. Iacted to the best of my ability on all advice given (this was plentiful and somewhatcontradictory).I think it would be improper in this particular minute to speak of matters relating to the briefings I received from . . . since I realise the tremendous stressand difficulties my advisers were under. The kindest thing I can say is that thebriefings were not consistent and could not in any circumstances support the contention that I was asked specifically to tackle the Daily Express and Daily Mailon the basis of the two &apos; D&apos; notices of 27th April, 1956 and 30th October, 1961.In the case of the first one, the argument had already been rendered untenable bythe past history of telephone tapping and, in the second, any emphasis would havedisclosed to Chapman Pincher the true nature of the operation.For what it is worth, I think Pincher and his Editor genuinely believed,in spite of what I had said to the contrary, that this interception of telegrams and cables was the responsibility of the present Administration. The motivebehind publication was political and the fear of being scooped by anotherpaper (the informant had said he had given the story to foreign as well as british news agencies).(Sd.)  L. G.

Second statement in the House of Commons concerning &apos; D &apos; notices.(ii)Statement of Evidence of Mr. Charles Angus MacphersonI am the Defence Correspondent for the Daily Mail.I began inquiries on the cable vetting story on Wednesday, 15th February, as aresult of information received on the previous night. Miss Celia Haddencollaborated with me. By Friday I had no story on paper as my inquiries werenot completed. I would in any event not have submitted my story for publica-tion without first checking with Colonel Lohan, with whom I am regularlyin touch.On the Friday afternoon I was told by Mr. Matthewman&apos;s office that colonel lohan had telephoned saying that he knew of our inquiries and requested usto do nothing further until he had seen us.At about 5.30 p.m. I telephoned Colonel Lohan at Charing and asked himwhat this was all about. He said that he knew Miss Hadden was makinginquiries, and warned me that this was a very sensitive area of security, thathe had already talked to Mr. Matthewman&apos;s office and that he was going to seeus on Monday. He said also that whatever source we had was getting into deepwaters and while he appreciated I could not give him any names he would be grateful if the source could be warned. He said that another paper also knewabout this and that they had had the same advice. I made an appointment tomeet him at 3 p.m. on the following Monday.63
On the following Monday I went to Mr. Matthewman&apos;s office just after 3.00p.m. where Colonel Lohan was already with Mr. Matthewman. I have readMr. Matthewman&apos;s full account of this conversation and I agree with it, exceptthat I do not specifically remember any reference to &apos; D &apos; notices ; any such reference would come as no surprise to me, since I regarded this story as withinthe &apos; D &apos; notice procedure.As a result of all what Colonel Lohan told us I felt that we should not publish.At about 11.30 p.m. that night at home I received a message from Mr. Beverley,and a story which he had written was read over to me and I confirmed it. I was told that Colonel Lohan had asked for certain information to be omitted.(iii)Statement of Evidence of Mr. Eric Victor MatthewmanI am the Managing Editor of the Daily Mail.Prior to the 17th February I knew nothing about the cable vetting story, buton the 17th February in the afternoon I was told by the Assistant ManagingEditor, a Mr. J. H. Spence, that Colonel Lohan had &apos;phoned and wished urgentlyto discuss inquiries that the Daily Mail were making about checks on com-mercial cables, and that Colonel Lohan was ready to come up to London to discuss this matter if necessary. I immediately &apos;phoned Colonel Lohan at a Charingnumber. He said he knew that we were making inquiries concerning cable vet-ting, and that publication of a story about this matter would be prejudicial tothe work of the security services. He said that he knew inquiries were beingmade by Miss Celia Hadden, and that he was very anxious that the inquiriesshould stop forthwith. He said that he had put a stop on the story with anothernewsoaper.  I said that I would make inquiries and rang off.I then spoke to Celia Hadden, and asked her what the story was all about,she told me the details, adding that there was nothing on paper at this stage.She told me that Mr. Macpherson was also making inquiries. I then checkedwith the newsroom who confirmed that there was nothing on paper and thatthere was no question of publication that weekend.I telephoned Colonel Lohan again and reported this, and he said as nothing wasbeing done about the story over the weekend, there was no point in himcoming up to London that day. He said that he would arrange to meet me onthe following Monday.I reported to the Editor, and again confirmed with the news room that the story would not be published that weekend.On Monday, 20th February, Colonel Lohan came to my office about 3 p.m.,Mr. Macpherson having made an appointment with him. Mr. Macphersonarrived after a few minutes. Colonel Lohan agreed that the substance of our information was correct. He said that this was a regular form of communicationfor spies and that security checks had been going on for many years andyielded worthwhile results. He said it would prejudice their work if publicitywas given to the steps taken by the security forces. He agreed that the samplingwas to a degree random but that it could be made more selective by concentration in specific areas. He said there were two &apos; D&apos; notices which could be said tocover the particular circumstances (which he had in his pockets and half tookout and then put back again) but that he was not relying upon them on this occasion but the matter was best discussed on the basis of his personal approach.Mr. Macpherson then asked Colonel Lohan whether security operations were involved at the present time and whether the checks were general routine ;Colonel Lohan replied that there was always a particular operation of one kindor another going on. Macpherson then repeated his question in greater detailasking whether there was a specific operation now in progress directed towards a particular person of which we could hear the result in the near future.Colonel Lohan replied that there was a particular operation, on which he could put no time for a possible result, but if Macpherson meant would it become apparent in his (Macpherson) lifetime, the answer would be yes.   He could
go no further. Colonel Lohan said that authority for the cable vetting was obtained as required under a warrant issued in accordance with the official secrets Act. I told Colonel Lohan that as far as I was concerned I was preparedto accept the undesirability of publication, but that this was clearly a decision forthe Editor. He concluded by saying that he would tell us if any other newspaperwas publishing the story. I went straight to the Editor and told him the gist ofwhat Colonel Lohan had said. He then asked me if Colonel Lohan had said thatthere was any specific vetting operation in progress. I said yes, and told himwhat Colonel Lohan had said in answer to Mr. Macpherson&apos;s question. the editor and I then discussed whether the question in principle was to what weight to be given to a personal approach of this kind by Colonel Lohan, and decidedthat it was equivalent to a &apos; D&apos; notice. Consequently the Editor decided not to publish and gave instructions to this effect which I passed to the news desk.I also reported the Editor&apos;s decision to Colonel Lohan.Later that night I received a &apos;phone call from Mr. Beverley, telling me that colonel Lohan had &apos;phoned to say that the story of the cable vetting was appear-ing in the Scottish Edition of the Daily Express, and he asked me to confirm where we stood on this. I told him about my conversation with Colonel Lohan that afternoon and the subsequent decision of the Editor not to publish. I decidedto inform the Editor immediately, obtained his number in Regents Park and reported my conversation with Beverley.On the following day I wrote the bracketed note in the Parliamentary Reportof Mr. Wilson&apos;s speech to explain the Daily MaWs decision.(iv)Statement of Evidence of Mr. Arthur BrittendenI am the Editor of the Daily Mail.I knew before Friday, the 17th February, that Mr. Angus Macpherson, the daily MaiVs Defence Correspondent, was investigating information receivedconcerning cable vetting whh Miss Celia Hadden.On Friday, 17th February, I was told by Mr. Matthewman, the ManagingEditor of the Daily Mail, that he had received a telephone call from colonel lohan, in which Colonel Lohan told Mr. Matthewman that he knew of daily mail enquiries into cable vetting, and that publication of a story about it wouldbe prejudicial to the work of the security services. Mr. Matthewman said hehad checked with the news desk and found that the investigation was not completed, and he had therefore told Colonel Lohan that the story would notbe published over the weekend. He added that he was seeing Colonel Lohanon the following Monday.On the afternoon of 20th February, Monday, Mr. Matthewman came to myoffice and reported to me the substance of his interview with Colonel Lohan,which had also been attended by Mr. Macpherson. Mr. Matthewman told methat Colonel Lohan had said that cable vetting did in fact go on, had indeed been going on for many years, but it yielded worthwhile results in detecting spies,and that it would seriously prejudice security work if publicity was givento this matter.I felt that the very existence of cable vetting of this kind was a disturbingstate of affairs, and was not immediately convinced that it would be wrong to publish the story. I therefore asked Mr. Matthewman if Colonel Lohan had referred to any specific kind of cable-vetting operation. Mr. Matthewman repliedthat Mr. Macpherson had asked Colonel Lohan that very question. colonel lohan had answered that there was indeed such an operation then current, buthe could not say when its result would be known.This further information convinced me that it would be wrong to publish the story and Mr. Matthewman and I discussed what weight should be givento an approach of the kind made by Colonel Lohan; we both came to theconclusion it was equivalent to a &apos; D &apos; notice. I therefore gave instructions that the story should not be published.
Later the same evening I was dining with friends in Regents Park when about10 p.m. I received a telephone call from Mr. Matthewman. He told me that colonel Lohan had telephoned the news desk to say that the cable vetting storywas being published in the Scottish Edition of the Daily Express. I imme-diately rung the news desk to say that I was returning to the office. Before i could leave the flat I received a call from Mr. Beverley, the night News Editorof the Daily Mail, saying that Colonel Lohan telephoned again to say thatthe Express was pulling out all stops to remove the story from other editions,and it was a mistake that it ever got in.Upon my return to the office I was handed by the Night Editor the firstLondon Edition of the Daily Express which contained the story on the frontpage. I was handed a copy upon entering my own office and almost immediatelyanother call from Colonel Lohan came through. He seemed surprised to get on to me rather than Beverley and to the best of my recollection the con-versation proceeded as follows:-Colonel Lohan, &quot; I am sorry you have had this anguish but it is alright now.&quot;Myself, &quot; I don&apos;t know what you mean &quot;Colonel Lohan, &quot;The Express have taken it out.&quot;Myself, &quot; They haven&apos;t, I have got the first London Edition in front of me.&quot;Colonel Lohan, &quot;Are you serious.&quot;Myself, &quot; Yes.&quot;I then read Colonel Lohan the headline and the first line or two of the story,whereupon he interrupted me and said, &quot; My God, this is awful. I must ringoff.  I have people I have to tell.&quot;  He then rang off.Meanwhile the story was being prepared by Beverley. A short time later he reported to me that Colonel Lohan had telephoned again to say that he did not feel he could any longer ask the Daily Mail to refrain from publication, butthat he promised to read the story over to Colonel Lohan for his approval.Later Beverley reported that he had read the story over to Colonel Lohan on the telephone, and that Colonel Lohan had asked him to cut out one phrase. . . which was inaccurate. Beverley said that he had in fact cut this phrasefrom the proof. The story appeared in the third and subsequent editions of the daily Mail, Beverley&apos;s original copy, which shows on page 4 the phrase . . .which was cut out from the proof and which does not appear in the article.On the following day I arranged for Mr. Matthewman to insert in the Par-liamentary Report of Mr. Wilson&apos;s statement in the House of Commons an explanatory paragraph concerning the Daily MaWs attitude.(v)Statement by Mr. Derek MarksI am the Editor of the Daily Express.At about 5.45 p.m. on Monday, the 20th February, Mr. Chapman Pinchercalled in my office to inform me that he had a story about the vetting of allcables going out of this country.Pincher explained that he had been tipped off the previous Thursday by aMr. Lawson, who had worked at one time for the Commercial Union CableCompany, that each day a Ministry of Works van called at the Company&apos;soffices to collect all cables that had been sent the previous day. They were returned later. The same practice was followed for the other commercialcompany as well as for the G.P.O.Mr. Pincher further explained that Mr. Lawson had first gone to the Daily Mail,who had put a girl reporter and a photographer on to the story; that somehowin seeking to obtain photographs on G.P.O. property they had offended againstthe Official Secrets Act and that Colonel Lohan had been able to persuade the managing Editor of the Daily Mail to drop the whole inquiry.
Mr. Lawson had then gone to the Manchester Evening News who had told him it was too big a story for them to handle, and referred him to chapman pincher of the Daily Express.Pincher said that he telephoned Colonel Lohan at once to ask whether inthe Colonels view such a story was covered by &apos; D &apos; notices and received thecategoric assurance that it was not.Pincher explained that he had had numerous conversations with colonel lohan on the topic, winding up with one over lunch that day.He said that Colonel Lohan had brought all &apos; D&apos; notices that might applyalong with him. He had pointed to them and said that none applied. Thesituation was similar to that on telephone tapping, where it had been established that though individual instances of tapping could not be referred to it waspermissible to refer to the practice as a whole.Pincher assured me that Lohan had agreed that the &apos; D&apos; notices did notapply but that he, Colonel Lohan, was under very strong pressure to persuadeus not to use the story. I assumed that the exertion of this pressure followedfrom the political row there had been about telephone tapping, particularlyover the tapping of the telephones of Labour M.P.s at the request of the Partyleadership when they were in opposition.I asked Pincher to let me see the written story in order that it could beconsidered then. Pincher stated that he had undertaken to represent to meColonel Lohan&apos;s views that it should not be published. Pincher had told Lohanthat though he did not think much of the chance of this view being accepted,since neither a &apos; D&apos; notice nor the Official Secrets Act applied, he would do so,but that the decision as to whether to publish or not had to rest with the Editor.Pincher returned to my office with a copy of his story and advised me thathe had spoken to the Legal Manager, Mr. Andrew Edwards, who was stillexamining one copy.I called Mr. Eric Raybould, the Managing Editor, who is my deputy andMr. Peter Johnson, the Night Editor, who would be in charge of the paperduring that evening.At this meeting Chapman Pincher assured us that Colonel Lohan had agreedthat the story was not covered by &apos; D &apos; notices, though it was obvious that theGovernment did not want us to print it.The Legal Manager joined us with the text of the Official Secrets Act of 1920.He pointed out that Section Four of this Act gave the Government power to inspect cables.Since the power was enshrined in an Act of Parliament, he submitted there could be no possible breach by referring to it. I asked Chapman Pincherto re-write the story incorporating the appropriate reference to the official secrets Act.When the story had been re-written the Managing Editor, the Night Editor,Chapman Pincher and myself again went through it. Again Chapman Pinchersaid that Colonel Lohan was quite categoric that it was not covered by a &apos; D&apos;notice.I decided to publish the story on the basis that:1. The powers under which action to inspect cables had been taken waspublic knowledge.2. The categorical assurance that no breach of a &apos; D &apos; notice was involved.3. That though our own inquiries had been proceeding since Thursday tothe certain knowledge of the &apos; D&apos; notice Secretary, and that thoughinquiries had been made by the Daily Mail before that, no attempt hadbeen made to claim that the matter was under &apos; D &apos; notice by the customaryconfidential warning to Editors.It is, of course, the practice of the &apos; D &apos; notice Secretary to send out a con-fidential warning to Editors when more than one newspaper is known to be67
making inquiries about a story, the publication of which would be held toviolate a &apos; D &apos; notice.At about 7.10 p.m. I left the office to go home and change and then go onto the Trevor Evans dinner at the Garrick Club.I left the story with Mr. Johnson, the Night Editor, whom I told I wouldbe back at about 10 p.m.Sometime around 10.15 p.m. Sir Max Aitken, who was attending the samedinner, advised me that he had been telephoned by the Foreign Secretary.He did not understand what Mr. Brown was talking about. Apparently Mr.Brown was saying something about a story we were running in Scotland whichwas under &apos; D &apos; notice. Sir Max himself did not know what the story wasabout, but he had told the Foreign Secretary that if it was under &apos; D &apos; noticehe would speak to me and that of course it would be stopped. He addedthat Mr. Brown had said we would have a much better story if we waiteduntil tomorrow.I immediately left the dinner and rang the Glasgow office from the GarrickCiub to see if they were in fact running any local story which we were notrunning in London to which this complaint could possibly apply. The GlasgowEditor said they were not. It did not occur to me that Mr. Brown had beenreferring to the Chapman Pincher story, and indeed my first question to the glasgow Editor had been: &quot; Have you got a Polaris story to-night? &quot; Hesaid they had not. I then rang the London office and spoke to Mr. Johnson.He reported as follows:That at 9.38 p.m. Colonel Lohan telephoned and asked for me by name,but Johnson said at that moment I could not be contacted, as I was betweenpoints he was in charge of the office. Lohan had asked if it was too late to stop the vetting story getting in. Johnson had said it was, as Glasgow hadalready gone to press, Manchester were about to go to press and london would be going to press in 20 minutes.Colonel Lohan added that his aim was to ask us to hold it for 24 hourswhile he made inquiries. When he realised this was impossible he had accepted the fact, adding that it was &quot; very sad &quot;.At no time in his conversation with Mr. Johnson had Colonel Lohansuggested that the cable vetting story was under &apos; D &apos; notice or even mentioned&apos; D&apos; notices.Having spoken to Mr. Johnson, I returned to dinner and informed Sir MaxAitken that Mr. Brown was complaining that a story was under &apos; D &apos; noticewhich was one we had cleared with Colonel Lohan. Sir Max Aitken advised that since he had taken the call from Mr. Brown I should get in touch withthe Foreign Secretary and inform him as to what the position was.Accordingly, I returned to the office at about 10.45 .,p.m. and spoke toJohnson, who gave me his aide memoire of his telephone conversation withLohan at 9.38 p.m. I then telephoned the Resident Clerk at the Foreign Officeand asked to be put in touch with Mr. Brown. He gave me the number ofMr. Brown&apos;s private secretary who he thought would be able to trace theForeign Secretary.Some time later I had a call from Mr. Bill Greig, Mr. Brown&apos;s personalassistant, whom I have known for many years. I explained to him what theposition was and on my saying that the cable story was not covered by&apos; D &apos; notices and that we had had it cleared, he said that obviously the foreign secretary must be under a misapprehension and not to worry.I then telephoned Sir Max and told him the action I had taken to get a replyto the Foreign Secretary.Shortly after this Colonel Lohan himself came on the &apos;phone and said thatwas surprised to learn that we were running in our first edition a story on cable vetting which he understood we had promised that we would not run, since it was under &apos; D &apos; notice.
I pointed out to Colonel Lohan at once that:431. I had been assured by Chapman Pincher that he himself had stated thatit was not under &apos; D &apos; notice and2. that though I had not been present when the conversation took place, Iwas quite certain that the only undertaking given by Sir Max to theForeign Office was that if the story was under &apos;D&apos; notice it would be stopped.Lohan maintained that he had warned Pincher that the story was coveredby &apos; D&apos; notices. I pointed out to him that he had known both Pincher and myself for a number of years and must be aware that neither of us would printa story knowing it to be under &apos; D &apos; notice. To this he agreed. He then addedthat since it was already in the first edition there was not much that could bedone. I asked him if he could tell me under which specific &apos; D &apos; notices the story came. To this he replied he could not as he had not the notices with him.He said that nothing could now be done and the conversation ended.This was followed by a further call from Mr, Greig, who said that theSecretary of State was in a great rage and that he was &quot; threatening all sortsof things &quot;. He had even gone as far as to say that he would ring up CecilKing as Chairman of the N.P.A. and complain that Sir Max had broken hisword. I again reported to Greig that there could be no question of Sir Maxhaving broken his word since all he had said was that the story would be stopped if it was under &apos; D &apos; notice.Mr. Greig said that he was sure it was under &apos; D&apos; notice and I again askedwhich &apos; D &apos; notice applied. My recollection is that it was in the course of this conversation that Mr. Greig agreed that Pincher knew as much about &apos; D&apos;notices as anybody &quot; probably more than Lohan &quot;.My recollection is also that shortly afterwards Mr. Greig rang again to saythat it was specifically under the &apos; D&apos; notice dated 27th April, 1956, reinforced by a subsidiary notice in 1961. (This may have been all part of one conversa-tion, though I do not think so.)I tried to telephone both Six Max Aitken and Mr. Pincher, but failed.I was now faced with a categoric statement on the authority of the foreign secretary that the story fell under &apos; D &apos; notice.Despite my opinion that no &apos; D &apos; notice applied and that Mr. Pincher had told me the truth, I felt obliged, in the light of Sir Max&apos;s undertaking to Mr. Brown,and because of what Greig had just said to me on the authority of the foreign secretary, to take the story out of the paper, and I gave the necessary instructions.Although Colonel Lohan had already said that from his point of view nothing could be done since we had published the story, none the less I tried to telephonehim to tell him of my decision to take the story out and to confirm that the&apos; D &apos; notice ban was still being applied. I failed to get him, so I next spoke to Mr. Greig and told him of my decision and the reasons for it.I then got on to Colonel Lohan and told him that I had decided to take the story out and assumed that nobody else would be able to use the story.Colonel Lohan said that he clearly could not stop anybody else publishingand that he knew for a fact that both the Daily Mail and The Times were going to print the story.At the end of his conversation Colonel Lohan added that on reflection hethought he should have got in touch with me last Friday but he had not done so because he thought this would have meant going over Pincher&apos;s head.This made it finally clear to me beyond any argument that a &apos; D&apos; notice wasnot involved and that we had been subjected to Government pressure to preventpublication of something that was inconvenient. I felt, therefore, that Sir Max&apos;spledge did not apply and ordered publication to continue.69
I then telephoned Mr. Greig, acquainted him with what Colonel Lohan had said, pointed out that this was an entirely new situation and that I obviouslycould not take the story out of the paper. In this last conversation I againemphasised to Mr. Greig that whatever else was said about the story, there could be no question of Sir Max having broken his word. Greig said that hewould make that clear to the Foreign Secretary in the morning.Accordingly I countermanded my last order, and we continued to print.Within half an hour of my conversation with Colonel Lohan the next edition ofthe Daily Mail arrived in the office with the cable vetting story leading thepaper.In the afternoon of Tuesday, 21st February, I was shown a report from theHouse of Commons that in an answer to a question on &apos; D&apos; notices thePrime Minister had referred to the Daily Express without mentioning us by name and had said that there had been:&quot; A clear breach of two &apos; D &apos; notices, despite the fact that the newspaperconcerned was repeatedly warned that it would be contravening thenotice . . .&quot;Until this moment all conversations about &apos; D&apos; notices had quite properlybeen regarded as being just as confidential as the notices themselves. Apartfrom any other consideration, it is impossible to debate publicly a difference of construction over a notice without disclosing the contents of the noticeitself.Shortly after I had seen the report, Chapman Pincher telephoned me to saythat he had spoken to Colonel Lohan and obtained his permission to disclosewhat had passed between them.This account was published on Wednesday, 22nd February.At about 6 o&apos;clock on Wednesday evening Colonel Lohan telephoned and said he would like to talk on the telephone or see me in my office. I suggestedthat he should come to my office, where he arrived at roughly 6.20 p.m.He said that he had come to make two points. Firstly he maintainedcategorically that he had told Chapman Pincher on the Thursday that the &apos; D&apos;notice did not apply.He declared that in later conversations with Pincher he had said in his view the matter could be claimed to be under &apos; U&apos; notice but that it was aperfectly tenable view as expressed by The Times that day, Wednesday, 22ndFebruary that it was not. Therefore he had argued with Pincher on theMonday on the basis of &quot; putting the &apos; D&apos; notices on one side &quot;.I asked Colonel Lohan if he had any objections whatever to Pincher&apos;s storyas published that morning.Looking at a copy of the paper on my file, Colonel Lohan said that he didnot accept the view expressed in paragraph number three that neither of the&apos; D &apos; notices cited by the Prime Minister &quot; could reasonably be applied to thematter in question&quot;. He said that obviously they had some application, butthat he had put them on one side in argument with Pincher since a contraryview could just as well be maintained. He added that in paragraph numberfour he would have preferred that Pincher could have reported that he &quot; usedall his powers of persuasion &apos; in the spirit of the &quot; D &quot; notices &apos; &quot;.Apart from that he had no complaint to make about the report. He addedthat though he himself had prepared the original answer for the Prime Ministerto Sir John Langford Holfs question he had not been consulted about the reference made to the Daily Express which had been tacked on the end. he did not agree with it.Colonel Lohan said further that it was wrong that anyone else should haveintervened on a &apos; D&apos; notice question as he was the only channel between the&apos; D&apos; notice Committee and the Press. After saying this and making some othercomments he then left my office.
Statement by Mr. Chapman PincherBy appointment at about 3 p.m. on the afternoon of Thursday, February 16th,a Mr. Robert Lawson came to my office in the Daily Express to see me. he told me that he had worked in two cable offices, Commercial Cables and western union, as a telegraphist, and had a story to tell of great public interest.Mr. Lawson then told me that all the cables and overseas telegrams sent from and received by those offices were collected daily by a Ministry of Worksvan and sent to the Admiralty building.He said they were held there for 48 hours, and were then returned to the cable companies. He said that his inquiries showed that this had beenroutine practice for at least two years and possibly longer.He said that he believed that all overseas cables and telegrams handled byall other cable offices and by the Post Office were treated in the same way.I told Mr. Lawson that if a person were under suspicion as a spy, it would&apos;be normal practice in any country for the security authorities to intercept hiscables but I was not aware that all cables were being made available for vettingas a continuing process. He assured me that this was the case. I told him that I would make further inquiries.Before he left, he told me he had previously given the information to the daily Mail but he had decided to come to me instead because, against his advice, the Daily Mail had sent a photographer to photograph Governmentvehicles being loaded up with bags containing cables from Commercial Cableswith whom he had previously been employed. He also told me that the LondonUniversity magazine called Sennet would be publishing the story if nobodyelse did. He was interested in the magazine because for some months he hadbeen a student at the University.I asked Mr. Lawson if he had ever signed a statement which would make itan offence for him to tell me this information about the cables under theOfficial Secrets Acts.He assured me that the only statement he had signed concerning his employ-ment with the cable companies was one which committed him never to revealthe contents of the cables.I then asked him what motivated his determination to get the informationpublished. He said that after reading recent reports about the way lettersbelonging to a certain organisation were being opened and vetted, he felt thepublic should know about the far wider intrusion into the privacy of cables. Hesaid he was particularly concerned that commerial informcation sent out in private by firms such as LCI. could become available to the Government.At no time did Mr. Lawson ask for money and I made it clear to him thatthe Editor of the Daily Express would not be willing to pay for such information.He was with me for about three quarters of an hour, and when Mr. Lawsonhad left I immediately rang the Defence Ministry and asked the Senior Informa-tion Officer, Wing Commander W. A. Harris, whether the story was true. AsI expected, he said he would have to make inquiries.Later he rang me back and said that the people he had been to see justraised their eyebrows in amazement and said nothing. Finally he agreed thatthe Ministry could neither confirm nor deny the story but would not even say this on the record.It is common practice for Ministry spokesmen to refer to &apos; D &apos; notices when these are relevant. No reference to any &apos; D&apos; notice was made by Wing Com-mander Harris.I then rang another official source who also made inquiries and told me,for guidance but not for attribution, that the information was substantially correct.Without this confirmation I would not have written the story.
At about 4.45 p.m. I telephoned Colonel L. G. Lohan, Secretary of the &apos; D&apos;Notice Committee and told him the information which Mr. Lawson had givenme. I asked him that if it proved to be true, was there any &apos; D &apos; notice to preventits publication. Colonel Lohan told me categorically that there was no &apos; D &apos;notice to interfere with such a story. I therefore knew that the Editor could publish the story if he so wished.Apart from the further confirmation of the routine practice which emergedduring my subsequent discussions with Colonel Lohan, I obtained no furtherinformation. All the main facts in my report published in the Daily Expresson 21st February were known to me when I spoke to Colonel Lohan onFebruary 16th and I mentioned them to him.At no subsequent time did Col. Lohan say to me that he had been wrongor had misinformed me during my first talk with him. Nor did he ever warnme that the Daily Express would be infringing any &apos; D&apos; notice by printing the story. Had he done so I would have been bound to tell the Editor that I hadbeen wrongly advised and that &apos; D&apos; notices did apply, after all. In all my previous experience, when I have had to tell an Editor that the Secretary hasruled that &apos; D&apos; notices definitely apply, the story has been suppressed.I did not write the cable story on 16th February because I was heavily involved with the Defence White Paper, which had been published on that day, and also decided to make further inquiries on Friday. In fact they produced no furtherinformation.In the early afternoon of Friday, 17th February, Colonel Lohan rang me to saythat he would have to ask me not to print the cable story after all. When I asked why, he said that it would cause a diplomatic furore because every embassy would immediately think that its cables were being read. I thought this was a feeblereason and said so, pointing out that I understood that embassies were allowedto send messages in code.Colonel Lohan nevertheless insisted that concern about the embassies&apos; reactionwas so great that if necessary Mr. George Brown, the Foreign Secretary, wouldintervene.He did not mention &apos; D &apos; notices but when he said &quot; This is a security business &quot;I agreed to write nothing until I had seen him on Monday, 20th February. Iarranged to call at his office where he said a security official would be present toexplain the reasons personally.On the Saturday evening I happened to be dining with Mr. Eban, the IsraeliForeign Minister, who was visiting Britain. I asked him whether he would be concerned if cables from his London embassy were read by the British securityauthorities. He laughed and said that he would expect them to be read. That,he explained, was why all embassies sent cables of any consequence in code.This satisfied me that the &quot; diplomatic furore &quot; alleged by Colonel Lohan wasa rather wild Government excuse to achieve suppression. Moreover, colonel lohan never mentioned it again.Colonel Lohan rang me again briefly at my home on Sunday evening to seek the telephone number of Mr. Lawson. He did not then know Lawson&apos;s namebut he told me that the Defence Ministry had informed him that somebody washawking the cable story around and had already been to the Daily Mail. I told him Lawson had no number but was going to ring me and that I would giveLawson Colonel Lohan&apos;s home number so that he could ring him if he wished.It was clear to me that Colonel Lohan had been alerted to the Governmentsstrong interest in having the story suppressed following my telephone call tothe Defence Ministry. This was confirmed by Colonel Lohan&apos;s subsequentstatements that he was &quot; under tremendous pressure &quot;.Later that evening Lawson rang me at my home to find out what was happeningabout the story. I told him I was going to see Colonel Lohan about it and that colonel Lohan wanted to speak to him. I gave him Colonel Lohan&apos;s telephonenumber.
On the morning of Monday, 20th February, I rang Colonel Lohan to fix thetime of my appointment at his office. He said he was terribly busy and askedto defer the meeting until the afternoon. As I had an appointment then, I suggested that we should lunch together, which would give us two hours to goover the whole business.  He agreed.Shortly after 1 p.m. he arrived at my table in the Ecu de France.Colonel Lohan and I then got down to a discussion of the cable story.Colonel Lohan produced two &apos; D &apos; notices from his pocket.   He said that thefirst, dated 27th April, 1956, could not possibly be applied.As to the second, dated 30th October, 1961, he said that this one had a marginalapplication but he indicated that he was not going to try this one on with me.He used a colloquial expression and put them both back in his pocket.I was thoroughly familiar with the &apos; D &apos; notice dated 27th April, 1956, havingdiscussed it previously in other contexts with both Colonel Lohan and his pre-predecessor. I know that its purpose was to prevent the release of information concerning secret Intelligence methods. An appendix made it clear that cable vetting could not be regarded as secret. The power is expressly provided inSection 4 of the Official Secrets Act of 1920. Editors are sometimes asked toavoid mentioning non-secret methods when specially requested in cases whereparticular persons are under surveillance. But Colonel Lohan did not mention that any particular case or person was involved. At no stage did he disagreewith my information that the cable-check was a daily routine business. He statedthat the check was made under warrant under Section 4 of the Official secrets act. I remember remarking that it seemed as though the warrant was beingrenewed on a regular basis, perhaps every month. He said he did not know butthat was probably so.I was also familiar with the second &apos; D &apos; notice dated 30th October, 1961. Fromthe way he set this one aside I knew that he meant that he was well aware thatI was familiar enough with &apos; D &apos; notices to realise that it was not valid in this case. I also gathered from him that he had made this clear to the securityauthorities.I knew that the &apos;D &apos; notice dated 31st October, 1961, requested editors not torefer to the fact that foreign communications have to be intercepted on occasions.I understood that this &apos; D &apos; notice referred mainly to. the ... In so far asit could refer to the vetting of cables, I understood that its purpose was to avoidalerting particular individuals under suspicion, as in the case of the &apos; D&apos; noticedated 27th April, 1956. The story I had put up to Colonel Lohan referred to the routine vetting of cables a system in which all cables are made available forscrutiny if required. I was therefore not surprised when Colonel Lohan set this second &apos; D&apos; notice aside without further comment. There was no argumentwhatsoever about the application of the &apos; D &apos; notices.I remember that I briefly reminded Colonel Lohan that a similar &apos; D &apos; noticesituation had arisen in the past with respect to telephone-tapping.It had long been agreed that while newspapers should avoid referring toinstances where a particular person&apos;s or organisation^ telephone was being tappedfor security reasons, there was no bar to writing about telephone-tapping ingeneral or claiming that its use was excessive.Colonel Lohan said that he had made these points known to the people who were putting the pressure on him. He then asked me to make a personal request onhis behalf to the Editor not to publish. It was clear to me that he thought that since &apos; D&apos; notices did not apply the only way of securing suppression of the story was to get me to ask the Editor not to print it.This was a sensible line because on occasion it had worked in the past.Through my co-operation with Colonel Lohan and his predecessor, the daily express has previously withheld information it could have legitimately printed.In this context he explained briefly and confidentially-that cables were vettedby the security authorities in the hope of establishing a &quot; pattern &quot; of messages
which might lead to information of security interest. He said that since aforeign agent or person inimical to the State would not use the same cable officebut would keep moving about, it was essential for all the cables to be available.I told him that I had no doubt that examination of all cables would provide some very useful information but that to me it seemed an excessive infringementof privacy in a free society. I further said that I was sure that everybody inthe restaurant would think the same if they knew about it and he agreed. I pointed out that the same arguments could be advanced in favour of opening allletters if this were practicable.Colonel Lohan did not intimate that any particular spy-hunt was on at themoment or that the security objections were in any way temporary. I understoodthat he wanted a complete, permanent ban on the story.At no further time were &apos; D &apos; notices mentioned. When we left the restauranttogether I told him that I would write the story according to the facts as I haddiscovered them and give it to the Editor. I also promised I would report hisurgent request that it should not be printed. I told him that if I were the EditorI should certainly print it. As I had already explained to Colonel Lohan, it didnot seem to me to be a story which should legitimately be suppressed. On thecontrary, I thought that it was in the public interest that the facts should be known.I promised to let Colonel Lohan know the result of my talk with the Editor.I returned to the office and wrote the story, which subsequently appeared thefollowing day, and took it into the Editor personally at about 5.45 p.m. Thiswas the first time that the Editor had heard anything about it.I told the Editor that Colonel Lohan had agreed that the story could not be suppressed under any &apos; D &apos; notice. I told the Editor that nevertheless strongGovernment pressure was being exerted on Colonel Lohan to secure suppression ofthe information and that he personally was requesting him not to print it.The Editor read the story and called in Mr. Raybould, Mr. Peter Johnson andMr. Andrew Edwards, the Legal Manager. The Editor asked me again about the&apos; D &apos; notice situation. I said that Colonel Lohan agreed that no &apos; D &apos; notice applied.I said no doubt there would be a row about it from the Whitehall end, butthat in my opinion we ought to print the story. I believe Mr. Raybould asked if the Official Secrets Acts could possibly apply. I said no, because Lawsonnever signed the Official Secrets Act form. Mr. Edwards showed the EditorSection 4 of the Official Secrets Act, 1920. The Editor read this and said thatthe Section 4 powers should be referred to in the story. I then went to my office andinserted this paragraph. I took it back to the Editor and he decided to print.It was not, however, certain that it would be used that night. It was now about.30 p.m.At about that time I telephoned Colonel Lohan to tell him^that I had written the story and had told the Editor of his request. I promised that if the paper decidedto print the story that night I would inform him as soon as possible, but that Iwould not know the final decision much before 8.15 p.m.Colonel Lohan said that in that case it would not be possible to reach him until he arrived home at Charing, Kent, at 9.30 p.m. and I promised to telephone him at that time.I left the office at about 7 p.m., having arranged to telephone the NightEditor, Mr. Johnson, to discover the final decision. I got to my home atEwhurst at about 8.30 p.m. and telephoned Mr. Johnson at 9 p.m. He told methat it had been decided to lead the paper with the story that night. I thereforetelephoned Colonel Lohan as arranged at 9.30 p.m. and told him of this.I was telephoned by the night news desk on two other wholly different storiesat about 10.45 p.m., but through some fault of one of the extensions, mytelephone was out of order when the Editor tried to contact me at 11.30 p.m.In any case, I could not have been of further assistance.On Tuesday, 21st February, at about 4.30 p.m. I telephoned Colonel Lohan.He confirmed his original statement to me that &apos; D&apos; notices were not involved.
To assist in understanding the atmosphere in which all my discussions with colonel Lohan were conducted, I should explain that he and I are oldand intimate friends. Our relationship over defence matters dates back manyyears when Colonel Lohan was in the Defence Ministry information department and we speak on the telephone almost every day. Incidentally, I had an equally close relationship with the previous Secretary, Admiral Sir GeorgeThomson.As I understand the position no request, as opposed to a ruling, from theSecretary of the &apos; D &apos; notice Committee can have the force of a &apos; D&apos; notice.A &apos; D &apos; notice, put up by a Government department, is not issued until its con-tents have been thrashed out by Press members of the Committee, who representthe interest of all newspapers, and who may reject it.I further understand that no Press members of the Committee were everconsulted by Colonel Lohan at any time in this matter.The existence of the request procedure must imply that in certain circum-stances the request may not be granted, and Colonel Lohan appreciated this.In my 21 years&apos; experience, the Daily Express has always felt itself bound to honour a &apos; D &apos; notice because, like any other newspaper, it gives the Press mem-bers of the Committee power to agree to them on its behalf.But every newspaper must feel itself free to reject a verbal request made bythe Secretary of the Committee that is not based oil a &apos; D &apos; notice. otherwise there is nothing to stop the Government using the existence of the &apos; D &apos; noticeCommittee as a means of imposing censorship at any time it likes.I estimate that I have written more than 1,500 reports involving &apos; D &apos; noticematerial without any previous complaint of any breach.As the Tribunal on the Vassall case was told, I have letters written on behalfof the Directors of the Security Services-M.I.5 and M.I.6 expressing theirgratitude for my efforts in securing the suppression of damaging information.Among instances which can now be mentioned because they are out of dateare:  1. My discovery that the main walls of the huge atomic explosive reactorsbeing built at wind scale were so defective that they might have to bepulled down. At official request, this was withheld by the Daily Expressuntil the walls had been repaired and the plant was working.2. The details of a situation involving the training of British secret agents in which trainees on an exercise in London &apos; kidnapped&apos; a member ofthe public instead of the man playing the part of an enemy agent.This was withheld after the Government pleaded that publication would damage Anglo-American relations by making the British security serviceslook stupid.3. My discovery, during the time of the Governments purge of Communistscientists, that a senior member of the guided weapons organisation hadbeen a Communist but was being allowed to keep his job.He also said that the Prime Ministers statement to Parliament that afternoonthat a certain newspaper (meaning the Daily Express) had infringed two &apos; D&apos;notices after being warned, was not based on any brief given by him.In the afternoon of Wednesday, 22nd February, after the Daily Express&apos;srefutation that morning of Mr. Wilson&apos;s charges, I spoke to Colonel Lohanon the telephone. He told me that he had been under the greatest pressuresconcerning a statement he had dictated earlier that day describing our dis-cussions. He never suggested that I had been wrong in any way over the&apos; D &apos; notices.
At Government request, this news was held back until the man hadbeen quietly transferred to a non-secret post.It is part of my duty to advise the Editor when I suspect that an attempt is being made to use the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure as an unfair way of muzzling thePress.What I considered to be an attempt to do this was made by the Governmentin 1961 before Colonel Lohan became Secretary. His predecessor issued ablanket &apos; D &apos; notice which, in my opinion, could have made it impossible forany newspaper to print anything about weapons beyond Whitehall hand-outs.With the then-Editor&apos;s approval, I challenged the wording of this &apos; D &apos; notice.As a result it was raised in Parliament by Mr. George Brown, then DeputyLeader of the Opposition.   In consequence the &apos; D&apos; notice was greatly modified.(vii)Statement of Sir Max AitkenI am the Chairman of the Board of Beaverbrook Newspapers Limited.At about 10.10 p.m. on Monday, 20th February, while I was at a dinner at theGarrick Club in honour of Sir Trevor Evans, a waiter came up to me and told me that a Mr. George Brown was on the telephone and would like to speak tome. A speech was in progress and it was a minute or two before I got to the telephone in the front hall porter&apos;s box.The telephone was on the hook so I rang the Daily Express who told me thatMr. Brown was still holding on for me. After a few pleasantries he said thathe wanted to discuss a story that we were running in our Glasgow edition thatwas under &apos; D&apos; notice. He said that he wished I would do something abouttaking it out. I said that I did not know what it was about, but that if the storywas under &apos; D&apos; notice I would certainly have it taken out. I said that DerekMarks was there with me and I would speak to him. Mr. Brown also said that:if we held the story for 24 hours we would get a better story. I did not know what he meant but I did not press him.On leaving the porter&apos;s box, I saw Harold Keeble who was walking down the stairs. I asked him if he was returning to the office, he said he was. I told him that the Foreign Secretary had been on to me saying there was a story in glasgow which was affected by a &apos; D &apos; notice ; would he please look into it immediately and if it was the case take it out and ring me back.I then went upstairs and spoke to Derek Marks. I told him I had had a califrom the Foreign Secretary to the effect that we were running a story in Glasgowwhich was under &apos; D &apos; notice. I asked him to find out and if this was the case:to have the story taken out. Derek Marks then left to telephone the office.On his return he told me that there was no such story. He could only conclude that Mr. Brown was referring to our national lead, but that this had been clearedby Colonel Lohan.I then said to Derek Marks, as a matter of courtesy he should get at once intouch with the Foreign Secretary and tell him what the circumstances were.I knew nothing about this story until Derek Marks told me of it on his return-to the dinner. There was no reason why I should. I did not know what Mr-Brown was talking about. As he said it was in our Glasgow edition I thought:it might be a Polaris story.Later on that night the Editor told me that he had been unable to get in touchwith the Foreign Secretary whom he understood was out at dinner, but he had spoken to Mr. Greig and told him that the matter had been cleared by colonel lohan.
Statement of Stanley George MundayI am in charge of the editorial messenger boys in the Daily Express office.A few days after Wednesday, the 22nd, when I had sent Floyd to Shell-MexHouse for Mr. Pincher&apos;s secretary, Colonel Lohan came through to me on the telephone. He said &quot; Are you the man that sends the boys out on their jobs? &quot;&apos;I said &quot; Yes &quot;. He said &quot; Did you send somebody to me like Floyd? &quot; I said&quot; Yes &quot;. He then asked if I also sent someone like Smallman. I said &quot; Just a mount, I&apos;ll look at the list.&quot; I looked at the list and said &quot; Yes. I sent Smallmanon Tuesday and Floyd on Wednesday.&quot; He said &quot;Could I have their fullnames? &quot; I said &quot; David Smallman and Peter Floyd.&quot;I knew later from the office that Colonel Lohan had been asking somethingabout receipts. It was something to do with his having lost them or wanting the dates when the messengers came to him.(ix)Statement of Mr. Maurice GreenI am the Editor of the Daily Telegraph.I have read the cable-vetting story by Mr. Chapman Pincher. I do not considerthat it is in breach of any &apos; D &apos; notice.In general these notices are designed to give guide lines. They are too ambiguousto be regarded as strict regulations.27th April, 1956. I look at Note 1. This makes it clear what was intended.I would regard the vetting of cables as a matter of common knowledge. It isafter all referred to in the Official Secrets Act. Then again, senders of cablesare not allowed to use code which might defeat Ministry of Defence scrutiny.31st October, 1957. As far, ,as this is concerned I have always had greatdifficulty in thinking that telephone tapping in general was ever covered by a&apos; D&apos; notice.30th October, 1961. I do not consider that this makes the regulations anytighter. You cannot, in my view, tighten existing regulations without some clear and definite words. These general words are not enough. They are helpfulguides and I do not think this applies to the general vetting of cables. One hasto consider the meaning of the words &quot; on occasions &quot;.There are no grounds upon which Mr. Pincher&apos;s story could be considered a breach of any of these &apos; D &apos; notices.If Colonel Lohan makes a personal request not to publish I would regard this as a matter for my discretion. I would naturally give careful consideration to therequest, but if I decided to publish I would not be in breach of a &apos; D&apos; notice.These things are always a matter of compromise. I never regard such a requestas binding in any way. It does not have the force of a &apos; D &apos; notice.Disregarding such a request is not contrary to &apos; D&apos; notice procedure in anyway. In such circumstances Lohan is putting forward only one point of view,and it is for me to decide what to do. If he based his request on the ground that publication would endanger the success of a specific current operation, then toput it mildly this would be a very important element in my judgment.I do not consider it is in the least odd that a proprietor should not know abouta lead story to his paper prior to publication. Indeed it is hard to imagine a case where a proprietor would regularly or often know of such things.
Statement by Edward PickeringI am a director of I.P.C., editorial director of Daily Mirror Newspapers Ltd.and a member of the Press Council.I was Managing Editor of the Daily Express from 1951 to 1956, and Editorfrom 1956 to 1962.I have always taken a special interest in and had much experience of defence matters. In 1965 I advised the Minister of Defence, at his invitation, on information and public relations inside the Ministry. I had much experienceover security problems and &apos; D &apos; notices.I made a speech at the annual conference of the British Academy of ForensicScience on the 13th June, 1964, in which among other matters I spoke aboutthe present &apos; D &apos; notice procedure.I knew Rear Admiral Thomson very well, and of course I know his successor,Colonel Lohan, with whom I worked at the Ministry, very well.When I was Editor Mr. Pincher was the Defence Correspondent, and weworked closely together. Accordingly, whenever any real problem relating toa &apos; D &apos; notice arose, Admiral Thomson would come to my office and he and Iand Pincher would discuss the matter.There were two occasions between 1956 and 1962 when I was Editor whenit was thought that the Daily Express had stepped marginally over the &apos; D &apos; noticeboundary. Both these problems were resolved by amicable discussion betweenmyself, Mr. Pincher and Admiral Thomson, followed by a letter from me byway of explanation, which was accepted by Admiral Thomson.Our relationship was always excellent and was one of complete trust. this of course necessarily included Mr. Pincher.Mr. Pincher was always very highly regarded by Admiral Thomson, whosingled him out as the outstanding Defence Correspondent, not only from thepoint of view of ability, but also because of his reliability, his integrity and the relationship he had established with Admiral Thomson and the Ministries. Itwas a relationship of complete mutual trust.Immediately prior to the Suez operation I often met Walter Monckton, whowas then Defence Minister, with Admiral Thomson. We had a number of discussions on the attitude of the Press to such matters as troop movements,overflying, and so on. In spite of the highly secret nature of the informationthere was never any question of any disclosures by Mr. Pincher, who was alsooften involved.  He was completely trusted.During the whole time I was Editor Mr. Pincher never once let me downover any matter of security (or indeed any other matter) and it must beremembered that during those years the situation was very much more difficultsince there were very many more &apos; D &apos; notices covering many more secrets.Since the present case arose I have looked again at the two &apos; D&apos; notices dated27th April, 1956 and 30th October 1961. I have also read the Daily Expressariticle of 21st February, 1967. As an Editor, experienced in defence matters,I can say that it would never have occurred to me that the &apos; D &apos; notices inquestion could possibly apply to Mr. Pincher&apos;s story on cable-vetting.As I understand the procedure, if the Secretary of the &apos; D &apos; notice Committeesays that a &apos; D&apos; notice applies to any particular story it would not be used,even if the Editor concerned thought that the Secretary&apos;s ruling was entirelywrong.From my experience with both Mr. Marks and Mr. Pincher I am certainthat both were well aware of this well-established convention. An Editor orDefence Correspondent might subsequently question the ruling by referring itto the Secretary and if need be to the Committee. This is the correct procedure,but they would certainly never publish the story once they had received acategorical ruling that the proposed story was covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice.
In my view, and I believe this to be correct, publication by one newspaper ofa story that is subject to a &apos; D&apos; notice does not permit others to follow.As I understand the procedure, if it was considered necessary on security grounds to prevent the publication of a story which was not specifically coveredby a &apos; D&apos; notice, or in respect of which doubt was felt, whether a &apos; D &apos; noticeapplies or not, the Secretary could have delivered to the Editor a private and confidential letter containing a formal request not to publish.I would refer to the &apos; D&apos; notice dated 27th April, 1956 which itself refers to private and confidential letters dated 28th December, 1950 and 31st July 1953.Where a story had been under discussion between a Defence Correspondentand the Secretary for several days, and in the absence of any private and con-fidential letter, and where there had been plenty of opportunity to deliver one,in my opinion, as I understand the procedure, there would be no bar on anEditor publishing the story in the exercise of his own discretion.I have been told the sequence of events and the situation which faced Mr.Marks on 20th February, 1967. I am quite satisfied that if I had been facedwith a similar problem I would have acted exactly as he did under the presentrules of procedure.(xi)Statement of Mr. L. A. Lee HowardI am the Editor of the Daily Mirror. I was, until my resignation, a memberof the Services, Press and Broadcasting Committee for two or three years.I wrote the letter published in the Daily Mirror of 25th February. That letterexpresses my opinion, which I still hold.I read Mr. Chapman Pincher&apos;s story in the Daily Express of 21st February, andI am familiar with the relevant &apos; D &apos; notices.With regard to these notices, I say as follows:  27th April, 1956. Checking cables is not &amp; secret Intelligence method. I think this notice refers to the activities of M.I.5 and&apos; M.I.6. It does not refer togeneral activities such as routine cable vetting about which Mr. Pincher wrote.As regards Note 1 to the &apos; D&apos; notice, while it may very well be the case thatroutine checking of cables would not be known among the general public, anysecurity service of any other country would know of it. This Note makes itclear that particular operations will be covered by the &apos; D &apos; notice, whereasgeneral routine operations such as Mr. Pincher wrote, about will not be covered.31st October, 1957. Common sense indicates that Note 1 to the 1956 &apos;D&apos;notice must apply here.30th October, 1961. I understand this to apply to something entirely different from the subject of Mr. Pincher&apos;s story. It is designed to stop anyone referring to anything that might identify the activities of M.I.5 or M.I.6. There is nothing in the routine vetting of cables that would fall within this &apos; D &apos; notice. That is why the word &quot; occasions &quot; is used. I understand this to mean that if a suddeninterest in cables were shewn by the Security Services you should not writeabout it. It cannot apply to a routine blanket activity that has been going on for many years. It might well apply to something which happened suddenly forthe first time. Generally I would say that it would be elementary knowledgeamong agents that we look at cables, and anyone who could be assisted by this information would already know about it. We don&apos;t want to publish anything thatwould help foreign agents.   Chapman Pincher published nothing that would.I do not know whether Colonel Lohan made a personal request to Mr. DerekMarks not to publish the story. In my view, Derek Marks had a completediscretion whether or not he complied with any such request, and I do not regard the action he took as being in any sense a breach of a &apos;D &apos; notice or ofthe &apos; D &apos; notice procedure.
Obviously if Mr. Pincher&apos;s story had referred to a special occasion one wouldnot have published it. However, it did no such thing. I think this is a very good example of an editor being justified in rejecting Colonel Lohan&apos;s request.The argument that the practice is being wrongly applied and that the price paid for security could well be too high is a sound one.I cannot imagine that Colonel Lohan would have done anything about trying to issue a P. &amp; C. letter in this case. It would be too silly for words to try and issue a &apos; D &apos; notice to stop Mr. Pincher&apos;s story.If Colonel Lohan had told me that a &apos; D &apos; notice applied to this story before i was about to publish it I would not necessarily have had to agree with him.The proper procedure would be for me to re-examine the story and then arguewith him to see if he could convince me. I would certainly not publish without taking it up with Colonel Lohan.I do not know that an undertaking was given that if this story was covered bya &apos;D&apos; notice it would be killed. However, whatever the &apos;D&apos; notice position,there can be no point in taking it out once it has been published. Any foreignagent would be able to get hold of a copy of the Scottish Daily Express.I have been told that surprise has been expressed at the assertion that Sir MaxAitken knew nothing of the story until he was told about it by Mr. Marks atthe Garrick Club. I would have been astonished had I been told that he didknow about it.  This is not the sort of thing that a proprietor is concerned with.(xii)Submissions on behalf of Beaverbrook Newspapers limited the following issues arise: 1. Was there on 21st February, 1967 a clear breach of two &apos;D&apos; notices?(Hansard 21st February, 1967, Col. 1432.)2. Was there a breach of &apos; D&apos; notice orocedure or convention? (Hansard23rd February, 1967, Col. 1975 and 1978.)3. If there was any breach, was it deliberate?4. If there was a breach, was it made despite reneated warnings given before publication? (Hansard 21st February 1967, Col. 1432. Hansard 23rd February,1967, Col. 1975.)5. Were Sir Max Aitken, Derek Marks, and Chaoman Pincher (or any of them)guilty of bad faith?   (Hansard 23rd February, 196*7, Col. 1975.)I.  The Published Story : viz., Routine &quot; Cable-Vetting &quot;.Elements in story : &apos;-(a) security.(b) the interference with personal liberty or privacy arising from generalinterception and study of private documents by Government officials.(c) political interest, following recent controversy over telephone-tapping.II. &apos; D &apos; notices and the &apos; D &apos; notice Procedure or ConventionSee RADCLIFFE REPORT page 35, paragraph 124.(a) &apos; D &apos; notices are letters of advice or request to Editors,(i) warning if a story is protected under Official Secrets Acts,(ii) requesting ban on publication as contrary to the national interest (page 35, paragraph 124).(6) Notices are approved in draft by the Committee with its Press element,which is in a majority, and despatched with their agreement (page 36, para-graph 130, and page 37, paragraph 135).
(c) A clear case of national prejudice of &quot; a military &quot; nature must be made out (page 36, paragraph 131).(d) Emergency procedure consists of the Secretary issuing a &apos; D&apos; notice onhis own, IF he obtains concurrence of 3 (formerly 2) Press members(page 36, paragraph 130).(e) The &apos; D&apos; notice system &quot; encroaches upon the very delicate subject of press freedom and to operate successfully it must not be subjected to over-strain and this basic condition of its existence must always be kept inmind &quot; (page 39, paragraph 143).(/) Respect  for  &apos; D&apos;  notices  is contingent upon  their confinement to&quot; military&quot; matters, and any attempt to go outside it is liable to beregarded with suspicion and be resented if a notice is thought to be&quot; dictated by political considerations &quot; (page 40, paragraph 143(a)).Therefore, basic elements; 1. &quot; Military &quot; character of the subject.2. Emanate from Committee on which a Press majority.3. Must be absence of political or official considerations.III. 1st Issue: Was there a Breach of Two &apos;D&apos; notices?   (Viz., that of27th April, 1956, and of 30th October, 1961).(A) Construction of terms of &apos; D &apos; notices(i) &apos; D&apos; notices are letters of advice and request. They are notlegal documents and it is unreasonable to expect them to beconstrued as such. They come from a Committee on whichJournalists are in the majority to advise and help other Journalists.(ii) Purpose of &apos; D&apos; notices is to avoid revealing security secrets topotential enemies of United Kingdom (see Radcliffe, page 37, para-graph 133). It is not their purpose to conceal official activitiesfrom die public in the United Kingdom.(iii) So, test of whether an intelligence &quot; method &quot; is secret, or is &quot; tosome extent of common knowledge &quot; (see (i) of &apos; D &apos; 27th April,1956) is whether or not such method could reasonably be antici-pated to be known to persons with some security knowledge andespecially to foreign security services and agents.(B) Relevant Notices 27th April, 1956 (with Appendix) Letters 30th October,1957 and &apos;D&apos; notice 30th October, 1961.(i) Applying test, could foreign security reasonably be expected to knowcables would be vetted?Submission :To many, cable vetting is common knowledge.Use of code in telegrams is restricted by G.P.O.Birkett Report refers to cable-vetting, emphasises the disfavourwith which all interception is regarded, but states that itsselective character goes some way to allay concern.SEE page 13, paragraph 37.page 14, paragraph 41.page 15, paragraph 51.page 26, paragraph 119.page 27, paragraph 120 setting out numbers of telegrams and letters.page 29, paragraph 133 N.B.
(ii) Would an Editor examining these &apos; D &apos; notices CLEARLY appre-associate they applied to a cable-vetting story Submission: No.(a) See evidence Editor Daily Telegraph. Editor Daily Mirror. Editorial Director, Mirror. Quotations from The Times 22nd February, 1967.Observer 26th February, 1967, and New Statesman 24thFebruary, 1967.All state that in their opinion &apos; D &apos; notices do not apply.(b) Letter 31st October, 1957, lifted restriction on telephone tapping andrefers to BIRKETT Report. BUT Birkett deals with interception of all communications, including telegrams and letters. The latter is soobviously known to be used on occasions (see Birkett, page 27, para-graph 120) that it is not referred to specifically in any &apos; D &apos; notice.Submissions on 1st issue: 1. Even if under a &quot; lawyers interpretation&quot; cable-vetting is a methodwithin &apos; D&apos; 27th April, 1956, and Appendix. It was certainly not asecret method to those engaged in security, especially foreigners. (SeeRadcliffe, page 37, paragraph 33, and Birkett, page 27, paragraph 120.)2. Other experienced Editors did not interpret either &apos; D&apos; as applying, andthese are the people to whom &apos; Ds &apos; are addressed.3. According to Colonel Lohan, to brief the Prime Minister that cable-vetting story was &quot; a clear breach of two &apos; D &apos; notices &quot; was &quot; WICKED &quot;.Therefore no breach of &apos; D &apos; notices no breach of either obviously no clear breach.IV. 2nd &amp; 3rd Issues: Was there a Breach of &apos;D&apos;&apos;notice Procedure orConvention and if so was it Deliberate?(A) If a breach in this case, must assume that where no &apos; D &apos; strictly appliesbut where Secretary (after laying aside &apos; Ds&apos;) makes a request not to publish,such request is tantamount to a &apos; D &apos; and rejection constitutes a breach.But .(a) That is not part of the &apos; D &apos; system.(6) If a request has equal force to a &apos; D &apos;, the purpose of &apos; Ds&apos; disappears.(c) The Secretary, by himself, is only a part of the Defence side of theCommittee, the majority of whom are from the Press side, and noticeshave to have the agreement of the Press members.id) A specific Emergency Procedure, whereby the Secretary can act with theapproval of 3 (formerly 2) Press members, exists. This procedure wasNOT used in this case, although opportunity to invoke this procedureexisted until at least 8.15 p.m, Monday, 20th February, 1967.Submissions :1. In the face of a personal request by the Secretary, an Editor is entitledto balance against that request considerations concerning public interestand the possibility that the request could contain elements concerningofficial or political embarrassment.2. The Editor considered the nature of this story and its public interestelements and since &apos; Ds&apos; did not specifically apply, he decided in hisrightful discretion to print.
.  The 4th &amp; 5th Issues :(a) Were repeated warnings that the story was in breach of &apos; D &apos; noticesgiven before publication, and(b) Were Sir Max Aitken, Mr. Marks and /or Mr. Pincher guilty of bad faith?Mr. PincherThursday, 16th February, 1967(i) Common ground: Chapman Pincher telephoned to Colonel Lohan andenquired if &apos; D &apos; notices applied to a certain story. Colonel Lohan said they did not apply.Conflict: Lohan said Pincher story was about collection of telegramsfor vetting from G.P.O.Pincher said he spoke of collection of cables for vetting from cableoffices.Corroboration of Pincher:(i) W/Cdr. Harris said that &quot;A little after 3 o&apos;clock &quot; Pincher had asked him about the collection from cable offices that afternoon. This wouldbe before Pincher spoke to Lohan (cf. Lohan&apos;s evidence). Harris saidthat if a spokesman knew a story was under a &apos; D&apos; he would say so.Harris said nothing to Pincher about&apos; Ds &apos;.(ii) 0&apos;Brien says Pincher spoke of cable offices and cables.Consequence: On Thursday, 16th February, 1967, Pincher had beeninformed &apos; Ds &apos; do NOT apply.(iii) Friday, 17th February, 1967Conflict: Pincher says Lohan telephoned, spoke of pressure, em-bassies and diplomatic furore, and requests Pincher not to write untilMonday, 20th February, 1967. Lohan does not recollect any such conversation and denies spokeabout embassies.ButCorroboration for Pincher(i) Lohan admits he spoke to Daily Mail on Friday relating postponement.Therefore, likely to have spoken to Pincher also.    Moreover, Mailincluded ... in their story until Colonel Lohan asked them to excise,them to excise.(ii) Pincher speaks to Mr. Eban on Saturday, 18th February, 1967, generally to ascertain diplomatic reaction to Lohan&apos;s story given Pincher onFriday, 17th February, 1967.(iii) Foreign Secretary was alerted on Friday, 17th February, 1967.Consequence of Friday conversationsPincher not impressed by Lohan&apos;s Friday explanations after Lohan&apos;sThursday clearance for &apos; Ds&apos;, and suspects official motive behindchange of attitude.(iv) Lunch, Monday, 20th February, 1967Common ground:(a) Lohan produced &apos; Ds &apos;:  &apos; Ds &apos; &quot; laid aside &quot;, and Lohan tries to persuade Pincher advise Editor not to publish.(b) Pincher vehement on public interest issue and infringement of individual and commercial privacy.(c) There was no mention that any specific operations were in hand.(d) Pincher promises to pass on to Editor Lohan&apos;s request.(e) On parting, Lohan had not &quot; won his battle &quot; in persuading Pinchershould not be published.
(v) Post Lunch 20th February, 1967Common ground:(a) Lohan goes to Daily Mail &quot; lays aside &apos; Ds&apos;&quot;. Mail understandsfrom Lohan specific operation was going on. (N.B. with Pincher thisnever mentioned.)Evidence:  Matthewman MacphersonSubmissions :1. Lohan took &apos; Ds &apos; to Daily Mail, but he laid them aside and did not applythem. Attitude of Daily Mail was that a request from Lohan wastantamount to application of &apos; D &apos;, although &apos; D&apos;s&apos; specifically laid aside.(This interpretation rejected by other Editor witnesses).2. If Lohan did not apply &apos; Ds&apos; to Daily Mail (admitted), how can it besaid that Lohan did apply &apos; Ds &apos; with Pincher and Express.(b) Pincher writes and first discusses story with Editor 5.45 p.m.(c) At about 6.30 p.m. Pincher telephones Lohan.(d) Lohan leaves at latest 7.30, catches 7.49 and arrives Charing, Kent,9.11 p.m.Conflict: Lohan claims about 3 to 4 conversations and that Pinchersent that evening for &apos; Ds &apos; from him. Pincher says only one conversation, when Lohan said not beavailable at 8.15 as en route and home by 9.30.Relevance: Lohan indicates Daily Express considering &apos; Ds&apos; onevening of Monday, 20th February, 1967 (i.e. goes to &quot; warning&quot;issue).But(i) Common ground that receipts produced show apparent date alterations.(ii) Pincher denies sent for &apos; Ds &apos; on 20th February, 1967.Pincher did send for &apos;Ds&apos; on 21st February, 1967 after House ofCommons Statement.(iii) Express messenger book shows messenger went to Lohan on 21stFebruary, 1967 and 22nd February, 1967 no messenger on 20thFebruary, 1967.(iv) After House of Commons Statement, Colonel Lohan spoke to Munday(i/c Express messengers) to enquire names of messengers and(y) Colonel Lohan&apos;s secretary enquired of Daily Express when messengerbeen sent.Submissions :Incorrect &apos; Ds &apos; sent for by Express from Lohan on Monday evening, 20thFebruary, 1967.No contact Express with Colonel Lohan AFTER Pincher spoke at about.30 p.m. until 9.38 p.m. when Lohan spoke to Johnson.Arrangement been made at 6.30 Pincher telephone to Colonel Lohan athome 9.30 just after Lohan&apos;s arrival at Charing Station at 9.21.Lohan of his own volition went out of contact during vital period 6.30-9.30 p.m.2. Mr. Derek Marks(i) Editor first heard anything about story 5.45 Monday, 20th February, 1967.(ii) Editor was assured by Pincher &apos; Ds &apos; did not apply.
(iii) Editor checked that Official Secrets did not apply.(iv) Pincher passed on Lohan&apos;s personal request not to publish.(v) Editor assessed not only Lohan&apos;s request but also political interest instory of a general interception of communications on such a wide scale.(vi) Between 6.30 and 7.10 p.m. having received no letter or further wordfrom Colonel Lohan Editor decides in exercise of discretion that, sinceassured &apos; Ds &apos; not apply, he would publish.Therefore, save from the Request from Lohan conveyed by Pincher, he received no warning not to print.Before Publication, he received no Warning that the Story was in breach of any &apos; d &apos; notice.(vii) Press times20th February, 1967Scheduled ActualGlasgow   .........             9.15 9.45Manchester         .......     9.45 10.30London    ...      ......           10.05 10.26(viii) 10.15 Editor at Garrick Club dinner for Sir Trevor Evans receives a message from Sir Max.N.B.

Between 5.45 and 7.15 Editor decides, in the exercise of his discretion,to print, having received assurance from Pincher &apos; D&apos; notices did notapply.2. Editor personally received NO WARNING that the story was under&apos; D &apos; notices until WELL AFTER publication.3. Editor exercised his discretion as he did because he did not consider a request from Lohan via Pincher had the equivalent force of a &apos; D &apos; notice.Submission :No evidence he printed story despite warning it was under &apos; D &apos; notice.Editor&apos;s interpretation of &apos; D &apos; notice procedure was correct.3. Sir Max Aitken(i) 10.10 Sir Max receives telephone call from Foreign Secretary at theGarrick Club.N.B.  (Foreign Secretary did not know Sir Max at the Garrick dinner.)Sir Max (being called to the telephone at the Garrick) assumed thathe did.

(Foreign Secretary agrees: see Transcript 14thMarch, p. 13, 1st paragraph.)Corroboration :(a) Editor&apos;s evidence.(b) Editor&apos;s assertion when he first speaks to Greig that the cable-vettingstory had been cleared earlier, i.e. Editor asserting story not under&apos; D &apos; and therefore no requirement to stop under Sir Max&apos;s undertaking.(c) Sir Max&apos;s version consistent with what subsequently happened, withprobable conduct of a Proprietor, and with the fact that a check wouldbe made before the story stopped.Summary of Position of Sir MaxNo breach of faith.Did as promised, namely, that the story would be taken out IF -t- ifwas under &apos; D&apos; notice.conclusion . This is an examination to discover if there was any bad faith over publica-tion of this story, and this issue should be considered judicially.2. The onus must rest upon those who assert.3. No evidence of bad faith by anyone.   At worst misunderstanding, and, if that, not brought about by Sir Max, the Editor, or Mr. Pincher.4. Daily Express is entitled to the following findings:(a) That there was no breach of any &apos; D &apos; notice ;(b) That there was certainly no clear breach of two &apos; D &apos; notices ;(c) That there was no breach of the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure or convention ;(d) That there were no warnings whatever before publication ;(e) That where a story contains public interest elements beyond solelysecurity, and where it is believed no &apos; D &apos; notices apply, an Editor mayexercise his discretion and cannot be criticised for exercising it in a way which officialdom dislikes.

Minutes of a Meeting of the Committee held in theCabinet Office on Monday, 13th March, 1967, at 2.30 p.m.Present:Lord Radcliffe (Chairman)Mr. E. ShinwellMr. Selwyn LloydMr. D. J. Trevelyan (Secretary)The following gave evidence: At 2.30 p.m. Colonel L. G. Lohan(Secretary, Press and Broadcasting Committee)The following attended: Sir Peter Rawlinson, Q.C. &quot;I Representing Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd.Mr. Brian Neill L   the senior executives of the Daily ExpressMr. A. Martin and Mr. Chapman PincherMr. A. EdwardsMr. Chapman PincherMr. T. BlackburnMr. F. W. BrothertonLord Radcliffe described the procedure to be adopted by the Committee.Sir Peter Rawlinson: There are two other witnesses who have not beeninformed. One is Mr. Raybould, the deputy editor, who is one of the seniorexecutives, and therefore I would like to call him as a witness. Then there isMr. Edward Pickering who is really a witness as to character, as it were, ofMr. Chapman Pincher, and also there is really his view of the &apos; D &apos; procedure which I would like to pray in aid with regard to what happened in the officeof the Express that afternoon.Chairman: If you want to you may, but they did not take part in theexchanges.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Raybould was present when various conversations werebeing spoken, so he could add to that, and therefore if there is conflict perhaps i might use my discretion in calling him. He is one of the senior executiveswho feels he might be involved in the suggestions that are ma4e.Chairman: If you want to call them you can. What we want here to dounder this procedure will be primarily to call Colonel Lohan, the Secretary ofthe Press and Broadcasting Committee, whom you know, and then according toour information two other persons who had communications of a direct order,Mr. Greig from the Foreign Office, and the Foreign Secretary himself, Mr.George Brown, who I think will be available tomorrow afternoon, who hadan exchange, as I understand it, with Sir Max Aitken, and Sir Max Aitken willbe available for us to hear next week. There are two other persons, that ispeople in the press office of the Ministry of Defence, and in the press officeof the General Post Office, who had queries from Mr. Chapman Pincher at anearly part of the build-up of the incidents, and I do not know whether thereis in fact any difference of statement about what passed between them andhim. If there is you would want to hear perhaps what it is that they have tosay about what they said to him and what he said to them.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes.Chairman: Do you know of any difference?Sir Peter Rawlinson: I do not. All I know is that there were conversations,and I know what Pincher states.   I have seen a list that has been kindly
provided of those by name, and it seems to be at least certainly one of themMr. Pincher did speak to, and I should not have thought there is much conflicton that.Chairman: You are certainly entitled to hear what they have to say of whatpassed between them and Mr. Pincher if you want to.Sir Peter Rawlinson: From my instructions the only person with whom thereare about 12 conversations was Colonel Lohan, and there may be little conflictor there might be quite a lot.Chairman: We shall be hearing Colonel Lohan from now onwards. On that basis we shall start.Evidence of Colonel L. G. LohanChairman: Colonel Lohan, we are going to go through what you can contributeon this question of what passed between you and various representatives of the daily Express and the Daily Mail on the days leading up to Mr. Pincher&apos;s articleon 21st February. You have provided for the committee an aide memoire. Ifyou want to look at it . . . A. May I refer to it?Q. Have it in front of you so that we can get along quicker that way. I amonly going to ask you to tell us at this stage of those parts of your experiencewhich consisted of exchanges between you and the Express and the Mail. Nowjust to get it on the record, you are the present Secretary of the Press and broadcasting Committee? A. I am.Q. You have been since. . . . A. Part-time since April, 1963, full-time since january 1st, 1964.Q. And you took on when Admiral Thomson. . . . A. When Admiral Thomsonhad a stroke. At a momenfs notice I had to take over. There was some littlecrisis on and so I took over while still D.D.P.R. in the Ministry of Defence.Q. Your previous experience in press and information matters was what? A. I was in fact director of a publishing company way back in 1935, and thatis a long time ago. Prior to that I had no experience with the press, otherthan as a reader, until about some time towards the end of 1957 when I wasbeing consulted by the Director of Public Relations at the Ministry of defence and finally came on to the staff early in 1958.Q. From 1958 you were in the Public Relations side at the Ministry ofDefence? A. I was.Q. Are you now a serving officer? A. No, my Lord, I retired on 31stDecember, 1963. The next day I took over my present job.Q. Now may I take you to the events relating to our present inquiry. I think they begin on the afternoon of Thursday, 16th February, when you had a telephone message from Mr. Chapman Pincher of the Daily Express? A. Thatis correct, a well-remembered afternoon since it was the afternoon I think thatthe White Paper on Defence was produced. He rang me in the afternoon,and said I cannot remember his exact words, but something like &quot; Is there a&apos; D &apos; notice on G.P.O. telegrams being collected and sent to the Ministry ofDefence?&quot;. My answer was, &quot;No, there is no &apos;D&apos; notice on that, but get onto the Ministry of Defence and come back to me.&quot;  He said he would.Q. Did you look up your file on Defence Notices before you gave that reply,or were you speaking from memory? A. I did not look it up. There was no need to.  There was no need for me to look it up.Q. Then I think having given that reply nothing further passed on Thursday,16th?-A. Nothing at all.Q. Then shall I take you to Friday, the 17th. Did you learn anything onthat day about publications or intended publications of a story about cable vetting? A. Yes, my Lord, it was mostiy on that day, it was concerned not so much with the Express, I think it is proper to establish, I knew the Expresswere involved. I was &apos;phoned by a member of the staff of . . . who saidthat enquiries were being made by the Daily Mai!, I think a Miss Haddon I
may be wrong and it may be Haddow, but I think Miss Haddon and they thought also that the Express might have the same story. I said words to this effect &quot; Oh my God, yes.&quot;   I suddenly spotted what I think . . .Q. I think, because you will have realised we are dealing with potentiallysecret matters, it is better if you do not refer to Government agencies by name or identify them. What we are concerned with is what passed betweenyou and what I will call the outside bodies. A. I spoke to three Government,agencies that day, all on the same matter. The moment that I knew thatthere was a story which involved &apos; D&apos; notices the first thing 1 tried to do, or what I succeeded in doing was getting hold of the Daily Mail. I spoke tosomeone on the telephone, and eventually I got hold of I have to refresh mymemory-Mr. Matthewman of the Daily Mail, who held the right kind of responsible position, and I think he was the managing editor. I tried to getthe editor. He was not available. I very briefly outlined what I knew, thatMiss Haddon had been making enquiries about the collection of cablegramsand telegrams. I told him that this was certainly covered by the &apos; D &apos; notice,and would he hold it up, and I would be very glad to come up to Londonstraight away. I had been at home, by the way, on that particular Fridayand was going to do a local job. I said &quot; I shall come up straight away &quot; andhis reply was extremely courteous, he said, &quot; Colonel, if you say so, we donot publish&quot; and there was very little discussion. Later on that day theDefence Correspondent, Angus Macpherson, of the Mail rang me up and asked me questions of a very general nature, and I said to him almost the same asto Mr. Matthewman, I said &quot; I am seeing your people anyhow, and we willIpave it at that.&quot;Q. Questions about what? A. About the story, he presumably had been toldby Mr. Matthewman that I had telephoned. I suppose he thought it was a defence story. Anyhow I was telephoned by Mr. Angus Macpherson, but the conversation was of little consequence and I confirmed what I had already said.Having got the promise from the Daily Mail that all was well until such time as I could see them, and there was no hurry, I then tried to raise Mr. chapman pincher. I think it is important here to say that I had to think for a momentwho to try to get in touch with, the editor on Friday, or get in touch withChapman Pincher, and I came down on balance that I should try to telephonePincher because he had already spoken to me about the story.Q. I take it you knew Mr. Chapman Pincher himself well? A. I go so far asto say I consider him one of my very great personal friends, apart from the work.I could not raise him, I telephoned him at his home and his office, and I have norecord of having spoken. I have several records of having telephoned his homeand office but he was not available. In fact I did not speak to Mr. chapman pincher until the Sunday evening. I imagine that I had been trying all Sundayto get hold of him. I think he was good enough, he telephoned me, and I wasvery glad to speak to bim. We admitted, or we agreed we could not discuss agreat deal over the telephone, but he said, &quot; Look, let us leave it for the moment,I am not going to go anywhere tonight, let us meet for lunch tomorrow and discuss it&quot;, which I agreed.Q. That is Sunday, the 19th?-A. That is Sunday, the 19th.Q. And a lunch appointment on Monday 20th? A. A lunch appointment forone o&apos;clock. In the meantime I had also agreed to see the Daily Mail immediatelyafter lunch, and I have no record of it, but I have a recollection of having spokenagain to Mr. Matthewman, I know we had discussed the fact, and I am not verysure, but I think I had spoken to somebody on the Daily Mail in Mr.Matthewman&apos;s office to confirm that they knew the Daily Express had got thesame story. I can tell you there were so many telephone calls that it wasimpossible to keep a check on all of them. That is as far as I can go for thepreliminaries.  May I now go to the conversation?Q. You met for lunch at a restaurant? A. At the L&apos;Ecu de France in JermynStreet on Monday 20th.Q. What we want to hear on this subject is what passed, and if possible in what sequence, between you on one side and Mr. Pincher on the other?-A. The
usual greetings. I sat down on his right and immediately produced from myinside pocket here (demonstrating) I did not want to carry a bag into arestaurant a copy of two &apos; D &apos; notices. One was a &apos; D &apos; notice dated 30th October,1961 which deals with the interception of communications, and the other of the27th Aprl, 1956, whch dealt among other things with methods used by the intelli-gence services. Almost immediately there might have been a word or two but Ihave no recollection of it but almost immediately Chapman Pincher waved themaside and said, &quot; I know them all by heart.&quot; I thought that was rather amazingand I said, &quot; So do I, but that is not the point.&quot; I said, &quot; All right, just a second.&quot;I then went off on another tack. I used the technical expression &quot; spin off &quot;, whichI had better explain. It is a technical expression. If, for example, by making anose cone for a weapon you manage to find a way of lining kettles so that theydo not burn, that is called a &quot; spin off &quot;. I said to Chapman Pincher, who is aman who uses a lot of these sorts of expressions, I said, &quot; Well, let me say straightaway that there is a &quot; spin off &quot; of political embarrassment about this issue, and i cannot dodge it. A story of this sort published would be politically embarrassing.&quot;I said, &quot; You know very well my attitude about this, and it is well known. Noone is under any illusion. I would not defend a single action under a &apos; D &apos; noticemerely to avoid political embarrassment. I will have nothing to do with it.&quot; Hesaid, &quot; I realise that.&quot; I said, &quot; May I say I do not have to refer to that again,the political embarrassment.&quot;Q. You would not have anything to do with any political embarrassment. A. And having made that point, seeing his agreement, political embarrassmentwas not an issue, I then went back again to the &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. Just let me ask you a question. When you said you did not go back to it,what does that mean, you put them back in your pocket? -A. No, I openedthem up as it were, and looked at them again and put my finger on it, there are about 10 words involved, a line on one and a couple of lines on another, and again Pincher waved it aside and said, &quot; No, no, they do not apply &quot; and hethen argued that the &apos; D&apos; notice of 27th April, 1956-and perhaps . . .Q. Yes, we can all look at them. Just tell me, did you point to any particularpart of these? They are quite long. A. I am not going to read them to you.I then pointed to this particular part, and it was the only part I was concernedwith.Q. On the 1956 one did you point to. . . . A. Yes, the bit that says:  &quot;Will you please in the national interest make no reference to thefollowing: (i) Secret intelligence or counter intelligence methods and activities in or outside the United Kingdom.&quot;He argued vehemently that the collection of telegrams and cables was an absoluteparallel, and he was quite strong about this view, very strong indeed, it was an absolute parallel to telephone tapping or opening of mail; in other words it didnot come under &apos; D&apos; notices. I have to admit, my lord, on the question ofmaking this particular section, as it were, parallel, that it did not operate becausethe action of collecting telegrams was parallel to telephone tapping, he had apoint there, because on 31st October, 1957, my predecessor put out a &apos;D&apos; notice not a private confidential letter a &apos; D &apos; notice saying:  &quot; You can no longer be asked to maintain secrecy on the use of &apos; telephone tapping&apos; as one of the methods employed by the security service. But youare earnestly requested in the national interests not to name or identify bydescription any person in whose case it is suggested that this method hasbeen, may be, is being or will be used, unless you are satisfied that his activities do not justify action on security grounds.&quot;I am not sure what the last fifteen words mean myself, but it is quite cleartelephone tapping was out as being required to have any kind of secrecy. On thesubject of opening letters there never has been any &apos; D&apos; notice considerationabout that at all. I argued that this was not parallel. May I say, my lord, thatat this particular time he was getting very, not angry, but vehement about thepoints he was making. I said, probably with some distress, &quot; Oh, for heaven&apos;ssake, let us put the damned things aside &quot; these were the words &quot; and let usargue about what really is at stake.&quot;
Q. At that point had you reached the wording of the 1961 Defence Notice,the other one? A. Not yet. I came back to that later. I said, &quot; Let us put this f &apos;\aside &quot;, and he then said, &quot; You have said that these telegrams and cables are Wcollected under a warrant. Surely this finishes the argument, and it is now exactlyparallel to telephone tapping and mail, and it is done under warrant.&quot; I said,&quot; No, I still cannot accept it. This is of much more general application. when you have a telephone tapped or mail opened, it is quite specific, the warrant isspecific. This is not a specific warrant and the Act is in itself very very broadlyworded. On this particular portion of the Act, and in fact to achieve the objectof this particular operation, the net must be cast wide, very wide.&quot; We thenwent on, and I did describe) to him why the net had to be cast wide, why it hadto have a central point to scrutinise the material, and this he seemed to accept.Q. You mean from a practical point of view? A. For sheer practical operationpurposes you could not have tiny little men hidden under counters at Post Offices,and you could not expect any kind of co-ordination if you had someone looking at something up in Glasgow and these were the ones I used with him andlooking at it at Glasgow, Birmingham or Bristol, or any other point, and itwould be quite impracticable. They had to be collected and scrutinised. Itwould be quite impossible to expect any particular post office or cable stationto discriminate on your behalf, and this again was quite impossible. All this he accepted as being an intelligent description of what happened. He maintainedthis view so hard about this being equivalent to telephone tapping that I almostgave up in despair and said, &quot; All right, let us go back to the other one &quot; and wereferred to this one of 1961. Well, I shall have to reserve certain remarks i made about this myself, but on the face of it it was a difficult one to push. one was skating on extremely thin ice.Q. We do not so much want your sentiments about it as what passed betweenyou? A. I have to tell you my sentiments because a lot of this is atmosphereand conversation, and not as it were a recorded thing, but done between friends.I have to tell you I felt I was of course skating on thin ice because I have someinfluence on Chapman Pincher. This says quite clearly:  &quot; The various methods used in the interception of foreign communicationsfor secret intelligence purposes.&quot;This put Pincher right off on a very positive tack. &quot; How in the name of heavencan you pretend this is the interception of foreign communications? &quot; I said, &quot;it includes foreign communications and communications made by foreigners. Itmust be.&quot; He said, &quot; You have just told me that the net is cast wide, and this can apply to every and all cables and telegrams.&quot; I said, &quot; Yes &quot; and he said,&quot; I do not believe this applies at all&quot; so again I said, &quot; All right, let us putthat aside and let us argue now even more generally on why you should not publish this story.&quot; I think we went into the conversation, which I will repeatif you like, where he then told me fully how he had got the story from this youngman Lawson and told me a great deal of what Lawson had repeated to him.I listened to this, and it must have taken up three quarters of an hour, the conversation, but I asked him to tell me all he could, and I kept on interjectingby saying, &quot; I do not know, I am not sure, I am not a lawyer&quot; because hekept on putting a number of questions &quot; Was the young man subject to theOfficial Secrets Act? &quot; and I said &quot; I do not know&quot;. &quot; What are the rules governing people who work in cable offices? &quot; and I said &quot; I do not know &quot; andall this went on and I do not know the line. However, I then managed to getthe conversation back again to this being an intelligence operation. Again Iam at a little bit of a disadvantage here, because I could not admit to himforthright that this was what he called an MI 5 or MI 6 operation, and I saidwe would have to leave it at that.Q. We do not want you to enlarge upon the various security considerationsthat were in your mind. What did you say to Mr. Pincher? A. I went onto point out to him what a fruitful operation this was in intelligence terms as best I could. I said to him, &quot;Look, if you had, for example, a pattern ofaddresses, or a pattern of signatures, meaning that if you were looking for a pattern of things going in one direction being sent by a person, or if you sawa pattern of code within plain language, a plain language code, do you see
how useful this would be to get agents or people who were acting against our(interests, could you see how useful it is that we should be able to keep tracksof this? &quot;. I saw that this made a point with him, and this was making a point,and I pressed it quite hard. I went on over and over again. There is littlemore to say, except I thought by the time we had finished that he was convincedin his own mind, although he kept on, for example, saying, &quot; Yes, but this has never happened before &quot; and I said, &quot; My dear Harry, it has been going onsince 1920, and it came to quite a crescendo just before the war, and it has been going on ever since, and it is a continuing operation.&quot; He then came back tosome crack about &quot; When was the warrant signed? &quot;, and I said, &quot; I do not know,&quot; but I thought I had convinced him that this was in the public interest,not to publish.Q. Just at that point, if I understand what you say, you had said to him, you had stressed its potential importance as an intelligence operation? A. Yes,undoubtedly. I must admit whether this is a piece of stupidity on my part Ivery much doubt; when I am able to say other things you will see I was forced into a corner. I think I was right in every way not to keep to theletter of the law. I could show you that, in another episode which involvedHarry Chapman Pincher, where I defended him against an attack from theMinistry of Defence. He does not know I did, but I did.Q. I do not want you, while we have the Express here who do not necessarilyagree with what passed between you, to go into your own background. Try to confine yourself to what you heard from them in your own various exchanges and what you said to them. Never mind that, that is another question we may go into later. A. I think I am right in emphasising once again that I was rightto put these aside that was the expression I used. The word &quot; relevance &quot; hascropped up ; may I say something about this? It is something he expressedduring the conversation.Q. If Mr. Chapman Pincher said it, yes. A. Not once during the conversationdid he use the expression &quot; relevant&quot; or &quot; not relevant&quot; ; the question of theirrelevance never came up. The word I am sure never cropped up at all. Neitherdid I at any time say they were irrelevant, but I did say &quot; put them aside &quot; inorder that we could get on.Q. Then you finished your luncheon party? A. We parted in an extremelygood mood. He said he would represent to his editor quite fairly what I had said. He made a joke as we left, saying, &quot; You know jolly well if you were the editor you would publish, wouldn&apos;t &apos;t you? &quot; I made no comment, except to laugh.We took a taxi together and I went on to the Daily Mail.Q. That is all that you recall on what passed between you at the luncheonappointment? A. It is very difficult to put two hours conversation into fiveminutes, but that is the essence of it.Q. You have had time to think ; you have thought; and that is all you canrecall of the sequence of it. A. Yes.Q. The next thing is that after lunch you then had an exchange with the daily Maill-A. Yes.Q. What happened there? A. The Daily Mail Angus Macpherson camedown to meet me in the hall. He took me upstairs, where I went into a roomwhere there was Mr. Matthewman, a woman was sitting behind me on my left andanother person whose name I have completely forgotten was sitting with hisback to the window. I sat down and produced the two &apos; D&apos; notices. A lot of the arguments were identical to the arguments that I had used with Pincher.I would only be repeating myself if I said them. There was one differencethough. At one time Mr. Matthewman said, &quot;Would these have any effect on current operations? &quot; meaning current intelligence activities, so I said. &quot;Yes, ofcourse they would.&quot; Immediately there was a tremendous feeling, one couldalmost cut the atmosphere with a knife all of a sudden, in the excitement ofthinking this really applied to a current spy case.   I saw the mistake ; whether
it was a mistake on my part or over-enthusiasm on their part; and I retreateda bit from there, saying, &quot; Yes, but do not forget one can never never say whatis actual, what is not.&quot; The same thing arose with Pincher. I think I wentmore away from the subject with them than I did with him. Again, to give them an impression it was something to do with a current spy operation wouldhave been totally wrong and would have brought the wrong results. They were very charming ; they asked a lot of questions, but all very much the same.Q. How did you leave it with the Daily Maill A. I thanked them, and I left itsaying &quot; Look, one thing is due to you and I hasten to say these are importantwords again I do not think the Express will publish, but if they do publish Ishall be honour bound to let you know &quot; for which they thanKed me.Q. And you left the Daily Maill A. I left the Daily Mail.Q. Then we come to about 5.30, a telephone call from Mr. Pincher to you? A. Ithink he did telephone me, yes, to say this, that the editor had asked him to write the story so that everybody could see what it was all about.Q. Go quite slowly about this. A. He asked me to write the story so thateverybody could see what it was all about. He did mention at that time thatlawyers had had a preliminary talk or a look at the material and they did not see that either the &apos; D &apos; notices applied or that the Official Secrets Act applied.I went on asking him a few more questions when would I hear what the editor&apos;decision was, and so on, and he said, a little sharply, &quot; My dear boy, get off the telephone ; I must get on with my writing ; you are only holding things up.&quot; So Ipromptly got on the telephone.Q. Look at paragraph 21 of your aide memoire and see if there is anything more which you recall. A. There is one thing I had completely forgotten. He didsay to me, &quot; Look, I cannot find the two &apos; D &apos; notices, can you send copies round? &quot;I said, &quot; I cannot possibly ; can you send round for them? &quot; He said, &quot; Yes, I will &quot;,and within a very few minutes a young man arrived from the Daily Express and took copies of the two &apos; D &apos; notices and signed for them. I have not the receiptwith me, but I have a receipt for them.  That is all on that particular question.Q. He broke off, saying . . . A. Obviously his voice was agitated andhe was under pressure. At 6.30 I began to get a bit anxious that I had notheard, and I said had a decision been taken, and he said, &quot; No, no decision hasbeen taken &quot;, and I said, &quot; Would it help if I come to see Derek Marks? &quot;; hesaid, &quot; No, no, I have represented your case quite fairly&quot;. Either then or afew minutes later, but I think it was then at any rate it was within five to tenminutes the next thing happened, where he said he&apos; had seen the informantonce again, and the informant had told him that he was unhappy about theway in which people were treating him and his story, and that he intended togive it to the foreign press. He said &quot; He is going to give it to the ManchesterEvening News and to the foreign agencies.&quot; I do not think he said any more,just that, &quot; But anyhow he is going around.&quot; My action on that was immediately to ring the Press Association who handle most of the stories that go out to theBritish press. I asked them if they would be good enough to let me know if aninformant came round with a story about the collection of telegrams and cablesby the Ministry of Defence. They said they would. I said, &quot; I would alsobe glad if you could hold up his story and keep him there and talk to me &quot;,because I was desperately anxious to try and get hold of this young man. Thatpiece of information came my way either just before 6.30 or at about twentyminutes to seven, but I again telephoned Pincher to say, &quot; Do you know mytelephone changes after 6.30; I am now Temple Bar 1022.&quot; He said, &quot; Yes, I did.&quot;   I said again, naturally, &quot; Anything to report? &quot; and he said no.Q. Then I think we can pass on to your paragraph 26 which seems to be thenext telephone exchange between you and Mr. Pincher at about 9.40. A. I madeevery arrangement if a decision came through to the office for someone to telephone through to Derek Marks and ask him once again if he would holduntil I could speak to him, but may I mention that I did go to see my chairman.Q. We do not for the present purpose want to know about your movementson the other side as it were. A. When I got home at about ten minutes pastnine I made enquiries; no telephone calls.   I thought by now it was not worth
ringing Pincher because it was getting very late for the story to come out. I. thought, &quot; Thank heavens that is all over&quot;, but at approximately 9.40 he&quot;telephoned me, he sounded very tired and very very depressed, and these werehis words, &quot;You have lost, the editors and the lawyers decided against you; I did my best.&quot;Q. Did you make any response to that? A. I may have sworn ; I do notthink I made any plea.Q. No significant response? A. No significant response at all. I think Iswore, &quot; Oh my God &quot;, something like that, but there was no point. I wanted to put the telephone down and get on as quickly as I could. My next action is towards the Daily Express.Q. Yes, go on. A. I then telephoned the Daily Express and asked to speak to Derek Marks, the editor. I was told he was not available, so I asked for the night editor. I regret that I did not make a note of his name at the time, buthe was the night editor.Q. Mr. Peter Johnson. A. I did put it into another note for someone else ;I thought it was Johnson. I said, &quot; Have you got the authority to stop this story? &quot; He said, &quot; No, I have not, because it is already rolling off on the glasgow editions.&quot; I made one more plea. I said, &quot;Are you sure it is notpossible? &quot;, and he said no. I put the telephone down quickly, and the rest ofmy conversation for the next two or three hours was with officials.Q. He said he could not stop it, it was already rolling? A. Already rolling,the Glasgow edition.Q. Did you ask whether you could speak to the editor? A. Indeed, I leftmessages to the editor. &quot; Get in touch with me immediately &quot;, and so on. I was told the editor could not be got in touch with at all since he was at that time between points.Q. Then you had an outstanding obligation to the Daily Mail I understand?-A. I did not act on that straight away ; I couldn&apos;t&apos;t; I had other obligations to officials, which I took. But I did ring the Daily Mail at I think about 10.30 orthereabouts. It was certainly as soon as I possibly could no, it must havebeen long before 10.30. It must have been about 10 past 10, or something like that. Then another official telephoned me. I told the particular official I was going to telephone the Daily Mail anyhow, and he telephoned me and said the express after all were not going to print, could I stop the Daily Mail. I goton to the Daily Mail again ; it was within seconds, there was no difficulty as theyhad not started writing the story. I did not hear from the Daily Mail until10.30 ; Arthur Brittenden, the new editor, rang me and said in a very distressedvoice that the Daily Express first editions had given splash treatment to the story.Q. This was the London edition? A. Yes, the London edition. Each papergets hold of other papers&apos; editions very early. He asked me what he would do,and I said, &quot; Well, you had better telephone your story back to me when you have written it,&quot; which he did, and I asked for one or two very small corrections,which was done ; and the rest of my time was taken up with telephoning officialsagain, and I did not speak to the Daily Express again until much much later.Q. Let us get it quite clear; why were you releasing, if that is the right word,the Daily Mail story? A. The damage had been done, and I do know from apast very very bitter experience is this permissible, because everybody I thinkknows about this particular story? In 1963 when I had put out a special &apos; D &apos;notice message through P.A. to stop a story about a defector called Anatoli Dol-nytsin this was 11th June, 1963 I found myself in very grave trouble with my committee because I had tried to stop a paper from publishing something whichanother paper had already published, and I had given up that exercise ; in anycase if there were any security damage done it had been done.Q. From your experience if the Daily Express was publishing this story you could not hold the Daily Mail?- A. It would be very absurd because a lot ofother papers would not trouble to ring me up. The Daily Mail had been co-operative. I do know from experience I get no support from my committee onthis one at all, none whatsoever.95
Q. Then you say at about 10.30 the Daily Mail came on to you ; you said,&quot; The Express are running the story in London &quot;, and you said, &quot; In that caselet me know your story.&quot; What next? A. The next time I spoke to the daily express was to speak to Mr. Derek Marks. He came up of his own volition.He had obviously got my message and had come up. Again, I really did begin to get a little angry by this time, because I said, &quot; Why did you publish this story, it is in direct contravention of &apos; D &apos; notices.&quot; He said, &quot; There were no&apos; D &apos; notices involved, you yourself said they were not applicable.&quot; I said, &quot;MyGod, I had the &apos;D&apos; notices by my side; how could you say that? &quot; However,he was quite firm that the &apos; D&apos; notices were not applicable. I said, &quot; All the conversation rested on the &apos; D&apos; notices. What other right have I got to talkto Pincher or anybody else unless I talk on the basis of &apos; D&apos; notices? &quot; It is either a question of the spirit or the letter ; the letter did not apply in this caseso the spirit mattered.Q. Just make it plain if you can; the telephone conversation after midnight;did he say they were satisfied that the &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply, or satisfiedthat you had agreed that they did not? A. The exact words he used were, &quot; Youtold Harry they did not apply.&quot; These are the exact words he used. This is what made me more angry. I said, &quot; I set them aside ; I am not going to argueabout them, but why do you think I brought them along with me? &quot; This iswhere we get two minds thinking along quite different courses. I could notmyself carry on any conversation with anybody without the relevant &apos; D &apos; notices.Obviously as far as the Express were concerned they had no relevance what-soever. This was quite clear when I spoke to Derek Marks. Again, I spoke to him much later. He rang me up and he said he had been told quite definitelyby the Foreign Office that &apos; D &apos; notices had been contravened and that he hadbeen asked to stop the story after two editions which had gone out. I said&quot; Who told you? &quot; He could not get the name, or he would not give it to him ;anyhow I did not get the name. I said, &quot;Whoever telephoned you from theForeign Office, get on to them and tell them to telephone me &quot;, because this would bring about a ridiculous situation, stopping a story after two editions when other papers anyhow would have picked it up. &quot; I know the Daily Mail have pickedit up because they did so with my knowledge, but I am certain other paperswill have picked it up.&quot; The thought of this thing growing out of all magnitude-tude, because to stop a story bang like that would draw the attention of theworld to it in any case.  I did not think that was a very good thing to do.Q. So you said to him, &quot; Get the Foreign Office to ring me &quot;? A. No one tele-phoned me. I tried to get through and I could not. I think, my lord, that is allI had to do with the Express on that particular day and night.Q. Now I think we can pass to what happened after the Prime Minister had made a reference to this in the House, because there was an exchange then be-tween you and Mr. Pincher, and I think Mr. Marks later. What happened then? A. About 4.35 or thereabouts, after the Prime Minister&apos;had made his remarks,Pincher asked me if I knew what they were, and I said, &quot; No, read them to me.&quot;He read them to me, and I waited for five seconds while what he said sank in.Then he said, &quot; We do not want to go on calling one another names ; did youor did you not say that these &apos;D&apos; notices and this is the first time he used the word were relevant? Did you or did you not say these &apos; D &apos; notices hadno relevance? &quot; I said, &quot;Harry, you know jolly well what I said ; I said &apos; Let usput them aside so that we can get on with the argument&apos;.&quot; There was some moreexchange about what that meant. . . .Q. Try to remember everything that you can in the way of what passed. A. May I start again by saying he used for the first time the words, that I had agreed they were not relevant. Then he said, &quot; But look, when I telephoned youon the Thursday did you not agree then that there were no &apos; D &apos; notices? &quot; I said, &quot;Yes, willingly, because the story you gave me then about G.P.O. cablesbeing collected by the Ministry of Defence, there were no &apos; D&apos; notices and you said you would come back to me.&quot; He agreed. I then reminded him I had brought &apos; D&apos; notices with me, that we had argued about them and I had said inorder to get on &quot; For heaven&apos;s sake remember the words I used, don&apos;t quibble ;I said &apos; Let us put them aside&apos;; that does not mean they are irrelevant.&quot;  Again,
I was not going to enter into an argument over semantics, the words &quot; put aside &quot;and &quot; relevance &quot;. I do not think there was very much more conversation. may i add something there that has crossed my mind? He did agree quite firmlythat I had argued, even eloquently, that it was not in the public interest to publishthose stories, relevant or irrelevant &apos; D &apos; notices; he made no bones about that,and I am sure he would not.Q. If that is all that passed on Tuesday afternoon, the 21st, then I think onWednesday the 22nd you went to see Mr. Marks? A. Yes, I did.Q. What happened then? A. I went to see him and said, &quot; Look, this is verypainful; I want you to understand particularly clearly the words that I usedwith Harry, and nothing on God&apos;s earth is going to shake me about that, and thewords I used were &apos; Let us put these aside so that we can get on with the basicargument.&apos;&quot; That was the tenor of what I wished to emphasise with DerekMarks. He was very kind, very charming, and he said yes. He did not arguewith me, there were no recriminations, nothing like that; it was a very charmingvery pleasant meeting. Again, I think I touched upon the question of political embarrassment, and I think I touched upon other things that Pincher had gonethrough which were not precisely relevant, that is to say, the way in whichFleet Street has been extremely worried lately about telephone tapping and opening up letters. One other thing I did mention which I think I ought to have mentioned and which has just come to my mind, is that one thing that seemedto annoy Pincher more than anything else during our conversation at the Ecu deFrance was that I could not deny that press service messages were included inthis collection for scrutiny. This made him extremely angry, and I repeated oneor two of these things to Marks to show him that I anyhow had gone along asfar as I could in terms of sympathy with what they thought was right, but I hadto stick to my guns about the way I had argued against Pincher that this is notin the public interest to publish, and I had to make that very very clear indeed.As I say, there were no recriminations.Chairman: Colonel Lohan, that is probably all that we shall want to hear from you about what passed between you and the Express and the Mail. It does not mean there will not be other times when we may want to hear about other partsof the proceedings.Mr. Shinwell: When you saw Chapman Pincher on the Thursday Thursdaywas mentioned in your deposition and you advised him to go to the Ministryof Defence, did he go to the Ministry of Defence? A. First of all, sir, I didnot see him ; I spoke to him on the telephone. Yes, he did telephone the Ministryof Defence.Q. Did he come back to you afterwards? A. Not on that day. I knowPincher very well; if he was going to write that evening he would have comeback to me without a doubt, but he did not. Besides it was the day of the white paper; I did not think he would. But I know Pincher, if he says he is comingback to me he comes back to me.Q. When he first told you the story, and it would appear at the time he proposedto write the story, apart from publication, it was obviously a matter for the editor,when he told you the story you did agree with him that the story he told hadno relevance to &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Was this again on the Thursday?Q. On Thursday. A. He did not tell me very much of a story ; the conversationdid not take more than a few seconds.Q. What did he tell you? A. I agreed there was no &apos; D &apos; notice applied to that.Q. You agreed it had no relevance? A. No relevance whatsoever.Q. But then the following day you became anxious about it? A. Yes.Q. Why? A. I have not been allowed to say about the conversation I had with various officials.Chairman: We will hear about it later, but I do not think it is part of the daily Express ...Mr. Shinwell: You said in the course of conversation with him I am not sure whether it was on Monday at lunch that you made mention of political97
embarrassment which you were anxious to avoid or you thought was irrelevant. A. No sir, the press are always very anxious one should never use &apos; D&apos; notice jjjBBjtto avoid political embarrassment, it must be a case of genuine security. I startedoff by saying to him I knew he could argue this way because the story would cause political embarrassment, and I started off by admitting it would causepolitical embarrassment, but compared with the main reasons for not publishing the story this was insignificant. He accepted this argument without any troubleat all.Q. What was his response? A. The response was, &quot; All right, get on andargue with me about the security aspects.&quot;Q. Did you ask him what his motives were in writing the story? A. No sir, no.Q. Did you suspect any motives? No sir, he was very angry indeed with what he described at the time as a damnable interference with the liberty of theindividual.  He was very angry indeed.Q. He used the language, &quot; invasion of privacy &quot;. Did he say that his privacyhad been invaded? A. He did mention in the course of the conversation, &quot;i know jolly well that the telephone . . .&quot;Q. Answer the question: Did he say at any time his privacy had been invaded?- A. Not in those words, but he did speak about an occasion when he though this telephone was being tapped.Q. Did he talk about anybody who had informed him that their privacy hadbeen invaded? A. No sir.0. There was no specific mention of anybody in particular complaining oftheir privacy being invaded?-A. No, certainly not, not at all.Q. You had lunch with him on Monday in a public restaurant? A. Yes sir.Q. And you produced the &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Yes sir.Q. You discussed these &apos; D &apos; notices in a public restaurant? A. Yes sir.Q. Is that customary? A. No, it was a very very private part of therestaurant, a little seat right down the end far from anybody; no one couldoverlook, quite impossible, and I very much doubt if anybody could overhear.Q. There is no doubt in your mind that this was a breach of the &apos; D &apos; notice? Yes, in spirit it was. On the letter, I am on very thin ice if I say it is a breach of the letter, but I think in the spirit it was a terrible breach of the &apos; D &apos; notice.Q. You are now confirmed in that opinion? A. I have never varied from thatat all; never, never, never.Q. You say that in the course of the lunch he became vehement; why? A. There were two occasions when he became angry. One was when I could notdeny that service messages from newspapers came within the general ambit ofthis collection and scrutiny ; that was one; the other was when he insisted thatthis was something which was happening now, of intensity now, and I said no,it is not, it has been going on. I think I told you a minute ago, I said it hadbeen going on since 1920, had come to a crescendo just before the war and hadbeen going on continuously ever since.Q. Did you make any reference to how he got the story? A. Yes, I asked him to explain to me how he got it.Q. Did he tell you who was his informant? A. He would not tell me thename of the informant at the time, but he told me everything he could abouthim, everything.Q. Indeed, I think you said in your evidence just now he said that theinformant, Mr. Lawson, had threatened to furnish the statement to the foreignpress? A. This is so yes.Q. Did Chapman Pincher say anything about that? A. He told me.   It washe who told me.Q. Was that one of the reasons why he decided to write the story, or did hesuggest that it was? A. Not specifically, but one does know, sir, that when a
paper gets worried that somebody else is going to pick the story up, good, bador indifferent, they get worried, very worried indeed, but he did not use this as an excuse.Q. Did he give you any indication that he had been in touch with this manLawson previously? A. Yes, he admitted he had seen him three or four times.Chairman: I think &quot; previously &quot; was the word.Mr. Shinwell: Previous to the Thursday when you met?-A. He did not sayhe had seen him specifically on the Thursday, I think he merely said he hadbeen given information. I do not know when he saw the chap.Q. He did not say anything about payment for the information, did he? -A. He did ; he said the chap did not want paying.Q. Specifically? A. He said it specifically ; he is not even doing it for money.Q. Did he say that in reply to any question you put to him, or of his ownvolition? A. He volunteered that.   I said, &quot;Tell me about this young man.&quot;Q. In other words, he said, &quot; I have a story from someone, he did not givea name but he said he did not want any money &quot;? A. He did not want any money.Q. But he threatened that unless this story was published by the Express, orPincher wrote the story, he would provide it to the foreign press ; is that what he said? A. That is so. Did I miss the point, sir?Q. He did not tell you the name of his informant, he told you that thisinformant had given him the story and threatened that if he did not write the story, which would be published presumably in the paper for which he wrote,he would give it to the foreign press, but he did not want any money for it? A. He did not say he wanted any money from the foreign press. chapman pincher told me this at about 6.30 &quot; I have established that the lad is now goingto the foreign press.&quot; This was at 6.30 on the Monday. Chapman Pincher didnot tell me that at the lunchtime.Q. On the Monday how long did this lunch last? A. About two hours.Chairman: I think the information that the man was giving it to the manchester Evening News and the foreign press camp on the telephone conver-sation at about 6.30? A. At 6.30 or thereabouts.Mr. Shinwell: It was not the conversation at luncheon or on the previousThursday. When he first came to you with the story he did not refer to hisinformant? A. No sir.Q. You only got to know it on the Monday? A. That is right.Q. At 6.30? A. No, he told me at lunchtime that he? had received the storyfrom an informant, but I had known about the informant from the Daily Mailway back on Friday. They told me of this informant and they said MissHaddon was acting on information given by the informant. I knew there was an informant about, not from Pincher originally but from the Daily Mail.Q. How often do you lunch with Pincher? A. Very frequently; about once a month.Q. What do you talk about? A. Invariably he wants to see me about somepiece of business, about something he wants advice on as to whether it infringesthe &apos; D &apos; notices. It is invariably a working lunch. I have never had lunchfor fun and games.Q. You have had previous conversations with him when he wanted adviceabout &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Yes, frequently.Q. Recently? A. Recently ; I had a conversation last time about &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. Never mind about last time, Colonel; I mean before Thursday; say a week or a month before. If you have a lunch perhaps once a month, at every oneof these lunches do you discuss &apos; D&apos; notices? A. He always bring up some-thing that he wants to write, and he says, &quot; Is there a &apos; D &apos; notice infringement? &quot;.99
He is always seeking advice on the right and proper way. He is one of thefirst people to ring up when any story of his touches a &apos; D&apos; notice.Q. On any previous occasion when you have had lunch or engaged in con-versation with him did he ask whether he could publish or write a story whichhad some reference to &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Frequently.Q. And you always advised him against it? -A. Not always. I havesometimes said, &quot; There is no trouble, why don&apos;t you publish? &quot;Q. But when you thought there might be a breach of a &apos; D &apos; notice youadvised him . . . A. I have said so very loudly, yes.Q. And he accepted your advice? A. I have never known him to go againstme, never.Q. Have you any idea why he has done it on this occasion? A. I shouldimagine, sir, that his editor thought the &apos; D &apos; notice did not apply and that itwas a matter of public interest.Q. You think that he would not have written the story but the editorinstructed him to do so? A. With respect, Chapman Pincher is a very goodcorrespondent, but he is not the editor of the Daily Express, and my own sneak-ing feeling is and I hope I am not suffering from any self-illusion here my ownsneaking feeling is if it had been left to Pincher he would not have published it.Q. How do you get that feeling, that suspicion? A. On the way he leftme, on the quite sad way in which he told me; the expression he used, &quot; you have lost &quot;. I was fairly confident that he was not going to publish.Q. Do you think he was sad about it? A. I am sure he was.Q. By the melancholy and lugubrious way he left? A. Yes.Q. He was regretful, is that your feeling? A. That is my feeling, very muchso, very strongly.Chairman: You have had many dealings with Mr. Pincher as a correspondentin the past? A. Yes, sir, for many years.Q. Have you found him scrupulous about the observance of &apos;D&apos; notices? A. Yes, I have one fault only, that he tends to make a legalistic argumentabout things. In fact it was he you asked me not to refer to this, but may I justsay this. It was one point where I upheld him. It made me determined to go ahead with rewriting &apos; D&apos; notices because I felt it was absurd to be in a position where you had to argue with someone like Pincher the legalistic meaning of something which was not a legalistic term anyhow.Mr. Shinwell: You said that you had a conversation with the editor, Mr.Marks? A. Yes sir.Q. Are you aware that Mr. Marks in a conversation with an official on tuesday morning agreed that this was a breach of the &apos; D &apos; notice? A. Areyou referring to a conversation he had very early on Tuesday morning with theForeign Office?Q. Yes. A. I was not aware of that.Q. You did not know about it? A. No. He told me- I think I said a momentago in a conversation that was fairly early in the morning on Tuesday, thatan official from the Foreign Office had told him that this was a direct contraven-tion of a &apos; D &apos; notice and that .it ought to come out this was after two editions,very early in the morning, 2.30.Q. What did Mr. Marks say about that? Did he say anything to you about it? A. His statement was rhetorical, it was open-ended &quot;What do I do about this? &quot;.Q. After the event?-A. Yes.Chairman: Well, we shall hear from Mr. Greig about who Mr. Marks didspeak to.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: I have only one question to ask, Colonel. In this memoran-dum you say in paragraph 12:
&quot; Pincher and I met for lunch on Monday, 20th February. As soon asI sat down I produced from my pocket the &apos; D &apos; notices of 27th April,1956 and 30th October, 1961. I pointed out a section in each of them sayingthat they would be the basis of our talk.&quot;I understand the section in the &apos; D&apos; notice of 27th April that you pointed outwas the one about secret intelligence or counter intelligence methods and activities in or outside the United Kingdom, which you have already told us about. Whichwas the section in the one o 30th October? A. The second one, the various methods used in interception of foreign communications for secret intelligencepurposes.Q. In this paragraph you say that you did that at once. Was there any talk about the sections then? A. Only what I have said, that he argued that comingback to the one of 1956 you could no longer say that this was a method, since it was so close to telephone tapping and opening of mail, and the fact thatit was exercised under a warrant. On the second one he said, &quot; Don&apos;t be silly,this is not a foreign communication &quot;.Q. I thought vou indicated that this took place at the very beginning of thetalk?-A. Oh, it&apos;did, yes.Q. At the beginning? A. Very early on, yes.Chairman: Now, Sir Peter, would you like to put any questions?Questioned by Sir Peter rawlinson. Colonel Loban, it was Thursday, 16th February, you told us, that youfirst heard from Mr. Chapman Pincher about cable vetting? That is right, is it not? A. In the afternoon.Q. He telephoned you?-A. Yes indeed.Q. And he telephoned you to get one answer, did he not, to argue a specificquestion? A. Yes.Q. And the specific question was did a &apos; D&apos; notice apply to a certain story,a current story? A. No, that must be qualified-&quot; Is there any &apos; D&apos; noticeabout G.P.O. I must emphasise this telegrams being collected by the Ministryof Defence &quot;-that&apos;s it.Q. You say he asked you about that. Did he use the word cables or telegrams? A. Telegrams.Q. Telegrams being collected by the Ministry of Defence? A. Yes.Q. Did he say where they were collected from? A. No.Q. Are you sure about that?-A. Positive.Q. Did you take any note of it at the time?-A. Not a,pencil note, no.Q. He wanted to know, you understood, if a story he had in mind, or informa-tion he had, was something which was barred by &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Yes.Q. And you gave a categorical answer, did you not? A. A categorical answer-no, there was not.Q. That meant you knew he had some information or some story about cablesbeing collected from do you say, from cables offices?- A. No, no. He used the expression &quot;Telegrams from the G.P.O. &quot; ; no cable office was ever mentionedin this.Chairman: By telegrams we do mean cables, do we not? Or are you thinking of inland telegrams?-A. I was thinking of inland telegrams.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes, it is everything, is it not? A. It is, as I realisedlater on, but as an afterthought, not at the time..     .Q. Mr. Pincher is going to say he. asked you in relation to this collection fromcable offices. Are you sure that was not so? A. G.P.O. I thought it was ratherstrange, just G.P.O. I think my suspicions would have been aroused immediatelyif he had said cable offices.101
Q. Were not your suspicions aroused anyway? Here was a story Mr.Pincher had some information about the collection and vetting of some formof cables. He told you this on Thursday? A. He asked me this very query.I said &quot; No, get on to the Ministry of Defence and come back to me &quot;. I knewhe would come back to me if the story was any bigger than that. What he told me was nothing.Q. I am going to suggest to you that what he said to you was that he had information from an informant that cables and telegrams were collected fromthe cable offices and taken down to the Admiralty and vetted. That is what he told you. Is that not right? A. No. The Admiralty I would think wouldbecome rather suspicious and wonder what on earth he was talking about.Q. He then went on to ask you if any &apos; D &apos; notices applied to a story of thatnature, did he not? A. Of the collection of telegrams from the G.P.O. by theMinistry of Defence ; the answer is &quot; No, there has been no &apos; D &apos; notice about that&quot;.Q. Did &apos; D &apos; notices apply to the collection from cable offices? A. It mightwell come under the methods of interception of foreign communications, andone could say that [it] could be a foreign communication if it was a foreigncustomer who was using the cable office.Q. Mr. Pincher&apos;s recollection is having asked you that specific enquiry andgot that categorical answer that no &apos; D &apos; notices applied, it was you who telephonedto him in the early afternoon of Friday 17th to ask him not to print the story. A. No, I did not speak to him again until Sunday night.Q. He said you came on the telephone to him on Friday 17th and asked himnot to print the story. A. I have a record of many attempts to get him at his office or at his home, but I have no recollection that I spoke to him on Friday.Q. And he says when he asked you why, your reply was &quot; Because this would cause a diplomatic furore, because every embassy would think its cables werebeing read &quot;. A. This would be one of the quick things I said to him, something like that, on Sunday.Q. This is his suggestion, that this was said on Friday, to which Mr. Pinchersaid, &quot; That is a very feeble reason. Embassies send their messages in code &quot;.Do you remember his saying that? A. On the Monday, yes. Not on theFriday, because I did not speak to him on the Friday, and not on the Sunday.I said &quot; We cannot discuss this over the telephone.   Lefs meet tomorrow&quot;.Q. This is Friday. I am going on with what Mr. Pincher says happened onthe Friday. And he says that when he said that it was a feeble reason, thatyou said the embassy reaction would be very great, and if necessary theForeign Secretary would have to intervene in the Foreign Office. Do youremember that? A. Certainly not, most certainly not. I would not even knowa Foreign Secretary would intervene on a thing like that at all. No, the answer isvery firmly no.Q. Would you not have said that at all? A. I would not have used that asa sort of gun.Q. The suggestion is you said that this was a security business and youasked him not to write the story until you saw him on Monday. A. This istrue.Q. This is Friday night. And he agreed he would not write the story until he had seen you on 20th February. A. The conversation took place, I maintain,on the Sunday night, and he said &quot; I will see you tomorrow &quot;Q. The suggestion is that for some reason you had changed your attitude tothis story between Thursday and Friday. A. I certainly changed my attitude tothe story on Friday morning.Q. I do not want to pry into information you received. But it is right thatyou received information on Friday which made you change your attitude? A.Yes.Q. So what you said on Thursday about &apos; d &apos; notices not applying, now youthought they did? A. Most certainly.
Q. There was a conversation on Sunday, of course? A. Oh yes.Q. When you telephoned Mr. Pincher at his home? Is that right? A. Yes.Q. Do you remember saying to him, &quot;At the Defence Ministry someone ishawking the story around and someone has been to the Daily Mail&quot;? A. Inthe evening I might have said, &quot;The same story is being hawked to the daily mail&quot;.Q. Was it then on the Sunday that you asked Mr. Pincher the name of hisinformant? A. Yes, I did, on the Sunday.Q. And asked for the informants telephone number? A. No, I asked himto get the informant to telephone me.Q. I suggest you asked for the telephone number and Mr. Pincher said &quot; Ido not know it, but the man is going to telephone me and I will tell the informantto telephone you &quot;. A. That is absolutely correct, yes.Q. Well, this was on Sunday evening? A. Yes.Q. What had happened between Friday and Sunday to make you more in-interested in this story? A. As I said, on Friday morning I received information-I knew what the story was about then. It made me completely change my mind.Compared with what I knew on Friday morning, what Pincher had told me onthe Thursday afternoon was nothing in comparison it was a mere bagatelle.Q. When did you first see somebody at the Daily Mail? A. On Friday Ispoke to them.Q. What time? A. Morning, I imagine.Q. In the morning you spoke to the Daily Mail? A. It was the morning, be-cause it was then that I asked ... I do not think I got Mr. Matthewman straightaway, I got him the second time round, and I was then able to confirm that itwas a Miss Hutton who was doing it Friday morning.Q. On Friday morning you knew two newspapers were interested in a storyabout vetting of cables ? A. Yes. And by that time the Daily Mail had also told me that the informant was hawking it around to a magazine called Sennet.Q. Now let us come to Monday. It was Chapman Pincher who telephoned youfrom his office and suggested you should meet, was it not? A. No how could he have done, when we decided to do that on Sunday night?Q. I suggest this happened on Monday, because you were not going to havelunch, you were going to arrange a meeting, but you in fact were busy. A. No,he suggested lunch on Sunday.Q. I suggest that was not so. Anyway, you did meet. Now let us go through this interview.   You had these &apos; D &apos; notices in your inside pocket? A. Yes.Q. Did you have the appendix which was attached to the 1956 one? A. Yes.Q. You had that with you? A. Yes.Q. Did you refer at all to that?-A. No.Q. Never at all to that?-A. No.Q. You took them from your pocket, and I suggest this is what you said.You looked at the 1956 one and said &quot; That could not possibly be applied &quot;, and you looked at the 1961 one and said &quot; This has some marginal application&quot;. i will just finish what he says you said. And you went on to say, Colonel Lohan,you were not going to try this one on with Mr. Pincher? A. No, this is not quitetrue. What I said about the 1961 one is right, it had marginal application. Onthis one I said after a very long argument about the parallel between telephone tapping and opening of mail, a very long argument.Q. You did say these were referred to at the beginning? A. They were in-deed ; we came back to them time and time and time again.Q. Were they not put back in your pocket? A. No, because I made a note onthe back of one of them. They were by the side of my plate the whole con-versation.
Q. Do you mean the whole of the lunch you had the &apos; D&apos; notice beside yourplate? A. Yes indeed, because I wrote something on the back.Q. I suggest you put it back in your pocket and said, &quot; Leave that aside. now we are going to talk about this &quot;, because you were asking not to print? A. Yes,most certainly.Q. But not on the basis of &apos; D&apos; notices, on general security grounds? A. Ihad a perfect right to ask that on the basis that I had an anchor in these two &apos; D &apos;notices.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Certainly. I am not suggesting you did not do the rightthing.Chairman: Colonel Lohan, you have not given an answer for the record. It issaid about the 1956 one the words were used by you in introducing it &quot; that could not possibly be applied &quot;. A. The answer is I quite definitely did not saythat. Early on, I agree, I said, &quot; I will put them aside &quot;, but I never used thewords &quot; That does not apply &quot;, and would not have taken them with me then.Sir Peter Rawlinson: What did you mean about putting them aside? A. Ifwe were going to spend the rest of the day arguing about ten words there and twelve words there we would never have got anywhere. I know Chapman Pincherwell, and to get into a legalistic argument with something which is not of any legal binding whatsoever would be very much a wasted effort.Q. Is it not right that this could only be prevented from being publishedif a &apos; D &apos; notice applied and the editor of course honoured the &apos; D &apos; notice? Thatis the only thing which could stop the story being published, is it not? A. Fromthe narrow point of view of the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure, yes.Q. You were aware it appeared in the telephone tapping report, and so on about what is expressed in the 1957 report, the general aversion, the generaldisfavour, of interception of communications? A. Very much aware.Q. And that the press and a lot of other people had the feeling that inter-ception should only be minimal? A. The press felt very intensively about this for a very long time.Q. And you knew the story being suggested was not selective like telephone tapping, but a general looking at all cables that was the story, rightly orwrongly, that was going to be printed. A. I had to explain why it was done,not specifically in application.Q. You knew unless a &apos; D &apos; notice specifically and actively applied there wasvery much press interest in publishing the story? Yes indeed.Q. I would suggest you used a colloquial expression between good friendswhen you put these &apos; D&apos; notices back in your pocket, that you said &quot; As faras these &apos; something&apos; . . .&quot; and put them back in your pocket? A. I canimagine the words I might have used, but I did not put them back in mypocket.Q. You can imagine you would use a colloquial expression? A. I frequentlydo.Q. Did Mr. Pincher say that this cable check was a daily routine business,with which you agreed? A. Yes.Q. It is right I just want to get this absolutely firm you never referred inyour conversation with Mr. Chapman Pincher to any current operation or currentcase that was going on?-A. No, not specifically with the Daily Mail I did.Q. No, with Chapman Pincher? A. No, because it would be highly dan-dangerous.Q. And it is right, talking about this general power . . . A. It would nothave been true.Q. Did you say to Chapman Pincher that people were putting pressure onyou, when you put aside your &apos; D &apos; notices, people for security reasons were putting pressure on you?-Obviously I cannot recall using any expressionslike that.   He must have seen that I was under pressure, since I was extremely
worried about the conversation of the previous night in case he should publishwithout seeing me.Q. Were you under pressure? A. One is always under pressure to getsomething done in a case like this. I would not have made the plea for him not to publish in the public interest if I had not been under some sort of pressure, but it was not the kind of pressure of moral blackmail, or anything like that.Chairman: I think we should not have needless mystery about this. What SirPeter wants to know is had you been in touch with security authorities beforethe meeting on the 20th; had they asked you to use your efforts to get nonpublication.   That is what you want to know, is it not, Sir Peter?Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes. A. Yes.Q. And the argument you deployed was not &apos; D&apos; notices but just generallyagainst the public interest to publish ? A. In general terms, yes.Q. And as you understand the procedure, that is a matter which if it is not strictly under &apos; D &apos; notice is for discretion of the editor? A. All &apos; D &apos; notices area matter for discretion of the editor.Q. Leaving aside &apos; D&apos; notices, there is a certain procedure where a &apos; D &apos; noticedoes not apply, but you think editors should know that it would be against thepublic interest to print? A. Indeed, yes.Q. Private and confidential letters, is that it? A. No, private and confidentialletters usually have a basis in a &apos; D&apos; notice, with one exception, . . . but in thesame spirit as one can issue a private and confidential letter one reckons thatthe conversation being in the public interest would come within the same spiritof the thing which I had to exercise.Q. What is the position? Looking at the framework of this lunch with &apos; D&apos;notices, you say beside you, I say in your pocket, you talking about being underpressure, you knowing that the editor ultimately would have to make his decision. A. Indeed.Q. Could you have gone back to your office after that lunch and had a private and confidential letter sent to the editor? A. I should think that would havebeen rather improper, having got the promise from Mr. Pincher and checkedlater with his editor and the editor agreed I had done the right thing. It istrue I could have written a private and confidential letter to the editor, but where would that have got me? It would have been rather improper. having taken the man into my confidence, made my plea to Pincher, having got hispromise he is a man of substance having got his word that he would repre-sent my case to the editor I think to have gone and written a letter to his editorin those circumstances would have been quite improper.Q. What you were asking Pincher to do was to go to the editor and say &quot; Lohanasks you not to print&quot;, was it not? A. In effect.Q. And did you not anticipate Mr. Pincher would say &quot; Lohan says &apos; D &apos;notices do not apply &quot;? A. No, I do not accept the word &quot; anticipate &quot;, no. I said so very loudly to Mr. Marks.Q. We will come to that. The argument was clearly that Pincher was saying&quot; If everybody in this restaurant knew all cables were vetted everyone would think it a great infringement of privacy in a free society &quot;? A. He used thatexpression.Q. And he said the same argument could have been used about letters? A.Yes.Q. I suggest that what happened was that on leaving Chapman Pincher toldyou he would write his story and give it to the editor ; do you agree with that? A. No.Q. And that he would report to the editor your urgent request not to print? A. The first time he mentioned about writing anything was the time he told me the editor asked him to write. The first time he ever mentioned about writingwas in a telephone conversation about 5.30 when he asked me to get off the
telephone so that he could get on with the job. He did not say &quot; Go back andwrite &quot;, he said &quot; Go back and put my case &quot;.Q. You expected him at least to tell the editor the story and tell him your views? A. I understand from Chapman Pincher the editor already knew the story. This is why he said he must go to the editor, because the editor knewabout the story.Q. I am putting to you now what he said. And when he left you he saidto you quite categorically that if he, Pincher, was the editor he would print, since it was not a story which he, Pincher, thought legitimately could be suppressed? A. No, he specifically said to me &quot; If you were editor you would print, would younot? &quot; and I laughed, I did not make a reply.Q. He does not agree with that. He says his view was that you could notlegitimately suppress this story, that in the public interest it ought to be printed? A. Sorry.Q. He did tell you he would inform you what the editor&apos;s view was? A. Yes.Q. And he left and went straight to the Mail?-Yes, I dropped him.Q. Did you expect to have a telephone call? A. From Pincher?Q. Yes.  Or from the editor? A. No.Q. Why not from the editor? A. Because Pincher is assistant editor of thepaper and in this particular case and I checked with his editor not very longafter it was right and proper to leave it in his hands and for him to tell mewhat the editor had said. I represented several times to Chapman Pincher&quot; Would you like me to see the editor &quot; answer No this happened at 5.30 or about ten to six.Q. At the moment you are just leaving after lunch. You had asked him togive a message to the editor. Did you not expect to hear from the editor? A. Not to give a message to the editor, to put my plea to the editor, use myargument.Q. You knew perfectly well the decision would be taken by the editor? A.Indeed.Q. Why did you not go and see him? A. Well, I have said so often that inthis particular case it would have been, I think, wrong, and Derek Marks agreed with me. If I had gone to him all he would have done was to send me downto Pincher ; Pincher is rather a special case.Q. The suggestion is that you knew in fact &apos; D&apos; notices strictly did not apply.You were trying to persuade the editor not to print, using your friend, who youthought would be influential, Mr. Pincher? A. Never no, no, no never.Q. And this was because pressure was being brought to bear on you by other sources? A. I was not using him in the capacity of a friend, but in his capacity as the writer of the story, and the sort of chap who. . . Ln fact I think if I had gone over his head that might have been an end of a lot of things. If I had gone over Chapman Pincher&apos;s head he would have resented it very much indeed.Q. Very well. At 6.30 I suggest to you that Chapman Pincher telephoned youfrom his office to you at your office? A. I beg your pardon. . . I have justnoticed Mr. Pincher is here.Q. At about 6.30 did Chapman Pincher telephone you at your office? A.At about 6.30?Q. Yes, that Monday evening, at about that time? A. Yes, he did.Q. Did he tell you that he had written the story and given the editor yoururgent request? A. Yes.Q. Well, the fact that he had written the story, did that alarm you? A. No,it seemed to me a very commonsense thing to do: After all, he was represent-ing two things the story on the one hand, and my plea that it should not bepublished on the other. What could be more natural than for the editor tosay &quot; Lefs see the story &quot;? There is a lot of difference in a story and the tellingof it.
Q. We have heard he had written the story and the editor had been told.Did he also then say if the editor decides to print Monday evening he would inform you as soon as possible? A. He said he would let me know, yes.Q. Did he also say he would not know the final decision, whether it was going to be used that evening until about 8.15? A. I cannot remember I justcannot remember that he may well have done I cannot remember.Q. I will just finish what he recollects that you said it was not possible toget in touch with you at 8.15, but you could be reached at your home at Charingat 9.30? A. No, I did not even know by that time how on earth did I know what train I was going to catch?Q. Did you catch the 7.49? A. Yes.Q. And get to Charing at 9.11 and get home at 9.30?-A. 9.10, 9.15, orthereabouts.Q. It gets in at 9.10.-A. It was a little bit early.Q. What time did you leave your office to catch the train? A. I was not atthe office I just caught it by taking a taxi by three seconds.Q. Mr. Pincher says when he rang you at 6.30 to tell you the story was written and he would not know the definite decision until 8.15 you said&quot; That is no good, I am en route; so let me know at 9.30 &quot;. A. I am sorry,I cannot accept that.   I did not even know I was going to catch that train.Q. Did you try and get the editor at 6.30? A. No.Q. Why? A. Because no decision had been made.Q. You knew the story had been written and it might be printed that night?- A. The writing of the story had nothing to do with printing it. The writing of the story, as explained by Chapman Pincher at 5.30, was done to clarify theissue.Q. Had you known this story was going round since last Thursday? Didyou think it was urgent? A. Yes.Q. And you never got in touch with the editor or sent a personal letter? A.No.Q. At 9.30 did Mr. Pincher telephone you from his home to your house atCharing? A. It was a little later than that.Q. I sugest it was 9.30. Did he tell you the decision had been to print? A.Yes, he said the words I used &quot; You have lost&quot;.Q. Yes &quot; You cannot win all the time, you have lost&quot;? A. No, he did not say &quot; You cannot win all the time &quot; &quot; You have lost&quot;.Q. And you said you swore? A. I think so, yes.Q. And then did you telephone Mr. Johnson of the Express? A. Yes.Q. At 9.38?-A. No, a bit later than that.Chairman: Do you have the &quot;words the editors and the lawyers decided against you &quot;?Sir Peter Rawlinson: No, my lord. A. They were in fact used.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I suggest it was 9.38 when you telephoned from yourhome to the Daily Express and spoke to Mr. Johnson. A. I should have thoughtit was a bit later still ...Q. I suggest it was then. Mr. Johnson made a memorandum of this justafter the conversation, he says. Johnson told you he was night editor and incharge of the newspaper? A. Yes.Q. And you said you understood Mr. Pincher of the Daily Express was proposing to use the cable story. Johnson said &quot; Yes, that is so &quot;. And you said &quot; That is very sad&quot; and asked if the story could be stopped. And hesaid there was every reason to think Glasgow had gone to press, Manchesterwould in a few minutes, and London in about 20 minutes? A. He did not use those words, but this was the sense of what he said.
Q. He made a note of it about 40 or 50 minutes afterwards. Did he say to you the editor was attending a dinner and at that moment he was possiblybetween points?-A. Yes.Q. Did you say that you would like to have contacted the editor in thehope that the story could be held for twenty-four hours while you made enquiries? A. Yes.Q. Why did you want it held for twenty-four hours? A. Twenty-four hours would have given me another go and time to go absolutely straight to the editorthis time and to go harder at it, if necessary to bring up any heavier guns thatI might find.Q. Is it not right, Colonel, that you are the only person who can make the representations on the matter of &apos; D&apos; notices? A. I am afraid so, sir.Q. There is no bigger gun than you, is there? A. Not on &apos; D&apos; notices. one could have gone to one&apos;s chairman, one could have done something elseprobably, one might have got hold of an official who could have put a bettercase.Q. So the editor would then be in the position of having to balance publicinterest, his public duty, and what was said today by your chairman, whoeverit was, against the security interest? A. We would have been back to what Ihad done the day before, but we would have had a bit longer time to do it.Q. Without a &apos; D&apos; notice? You never mentioned &apos; D&apos; notices to Mr.Johnson, did you? A. No, I did not have to.Q. You did not say to Mr. Johnson &quot; Yes, you are publishing a story to which&apos; D&apos; notices apply &quot;? A. No, I think that would have been rather improperto Mr. Johnson.  He told me he was in charge in Glasgow.Q. He told you he was in charge of the paper. You did not mention anythingabout &apos; D&apos; notices at that time.   Very well.   Do you agree that it was sometime about midnight when the editor received a call from you?-A. Roundabout then. I had so many telephone calls by then I had almost lost trackof time. I did not finish telephoning until about three o&apos;clock that morning,and it never stopped.Q. Did you say to the editor you were surprised to learn of the daily express running in the first edition the story of cable vetting, which youunderstood they had promised not to run, since it was under &apos; D &apos; notice? A.No, I did not say they had promised anything I mean, not promise not to run it.Q. I suggest that is what you did say, to which the editor, Mr. Marks,replied he had been assured by Chapman Pincher that you said this was not under &apos; D &apos; notice? A. Derek Marks did use that expression.Q. He was clearly saying he had been assured by Mr.,,Chapman Pincher thatyou said it was not under &apos; D &apos; notice. A. Yes.Q. And he also said that the only undertaking Sir Max had given was thatif the story was under &apos; D &apos; notice it would be stopped? A. I expressed consider-able anger when he suggested &apos; D &apos; notices were not relevant. Did he not say I said &quot; Why the blazes do you think I carried the &apos; D &apos; notices with me? &quot;Q. No. I am just putting to you what he said. You must tell us. A. It is a fact that I expressed considerable anger. When he suggested to me that the&apos; D&apos; notices were not relevant I said very angrily &quot; Why do you think I brought the &apos;D &apos; notices into the conversation?&quot;Q. I suggest what he did say was that you, Colonel Lohan, had knownChapman Pincher himself for a number of years and you must be aware that neither he nor Pincher would put a story in if it was under &apos; D &apos; notice. A.This he did say. He said &quot; We have never broken a &apos; D&apos; notice in our lives &quot;,and I agreed.Q. He said he had never broken one in the past and was not breaking onenow? A. He may have been saying it, but that was not my view. I was absolutely astounded, because no paper plays the &apos; D&apos; notice game better thanthe Daily Express.
Q. You will agree that afterwards Mr. Lee Howard when he resigned he gavehis view that it did not apply? A. He said no.Q. And The Times thought it did not apply? A. Correct.Q. And the Telegraph? A. Correct.Q. And the Observer and the New Statesman? A. They all agreed.Q. And that is what his point was? A. Yes.Q. Did he ask you what were the specific &apos; D&apos; notices and did you say you had not got them? A. I said I had not got them with me.Q. Did you not know they were 1956 and 1961, if you are so certain? A. Ican almost remember reciting them by heart to him, but that was not at issueat the time. I said there were &apos; D &apos; notices. I said &quot; What do you think I broughtthem along with me for?&quot;Q. I suggest to you that he asked you which ones they were, and you saidyou had not got them? A. I gave him the dates and said I had not got themwith me now, because I make a point of never keeping papers . . .Chairman: I am a little baffled: did neither of you know at that time which&apos; D &apos; notice you were discussing? A. I knew the dates of them, but I could notread them to him.Q. Did he know? A. I sent him down copies of the &apos; D &apos; notices, I presumedby then he knew what the contents were.Q. But had he not got a file circulated to him by you? A. They have hadthe &apos; D &apos; notices, as a matter of fact; the Express have two copies of each &apos; D &apos;notice, and they have four extra copies, because Mr. Pincher sent for some onMonday, and the editor sent for some again on Wednesday, and I sent them,again on Wednesday.Chairman: We shall want to know sometime, I suppose, where Mr. Markskeeps these things.Sir Peter Rawlinson: If you please. But he is saying you have said they donot apply, and if you say they do, he wanted to know which ones should apply ;he wanted chapter and verse from you, did he not? A. He did not seem toask me for the chapter and verse. I gave him the dates, but I certainly couldnot read them out, because I had not got them with me.Q. You had not got them with you, and you could not tell him the dates? A. I told him that, yes.Q. I suggest you did not. Now to go on with your part of the events, it was at 12.46 that the editor of the Express telephoned to you you accept it was12.46 when the editor telephoned to you, a call from the Daily Express to yourhome at Charing? A. It could well have been.Q. Did he tell you he had taken the decision to stop the story, and that he assumed that nobody else, no other paper, would be able to use the story? A. This did not enter into the conversation.Q. This is what Mr. Marks remembers. A. The only thing Mr. Marks saidwas: &quot; I have been rung up by somebody &quot; I do not think he mentioned thename, somebody from the Foreign Office &quot; and told that we do contravene the&apos; D &apos; notices, and I have been asked to take them out&quot;, and I said: &quot; Oh mygod, no, this won&apos;t do at all. Who telephoned you? &quot;, and again he did not seem to think he knew, and I said: &quot; You get on to them and tell them to tele-phone me straight away &quot;, because do you not agree with me that to take out a notice after two editions, when other papers were bound to have picked it up, would be to call attention to this out of all proportion to v/hat it was worth?Q. I must tell you what Mr. Marks remembers: you said that you, colonel lohan, could not stop anybody else publishing, and that you knew fora fact that both the Daily Mail and The Times were going to print? A. I donot remember. I remember mentioning The Times, but I have had so manycalls from papers all asking me, that I knew jolly well this had been picked up by most of the newspapers. Yes, Douglas Home, of The Times, hadtelephoned me in between.
Q. You knew that applied at least to the Daily Mail and The Times? A.Yes, indeed.Q. Did you say that on reflection you thought you ought to have gone onFriday to see the editor? A. I said: &quot; Did I make a mistake? Ought I tohave gone to see you? &quot; and he said: &quot; No &quot;, and I saw him in his officeand he said exactly the same thing.Q. I suggest what you said was: &quot; On reflection, ought I to have come andseen you? &quot;. A. No, I said: &quot;Did I make a mistake? &quot; and he said &quot;No&quot;,and I saw him in his office and again he said: &quot; No, all I would have donewould have been to hand you over to Chapman &quot;.Q. That was the last of that conversation that evening? A. Yes.Q. Next day, the Tuesday, is the Chapman Pincher conversation at 4.30 p.m.,when he telephones to you? A. Yes.Q. Did you confirm to Chapman Pincher that you had told him that the&apos; D&apos; notices were not involved? A. I agree that they were not involved inthe story he gave me on the Thursday, and then we went on to some further argument and I said: &quot; Look, let us get it straight&quot;, I said: &quot; Let us put themaside in order that we can get down to talking about basic issues &quot;, referring tothe &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. Did you in fact say that the statement made in the House of Commons,that there had been a clear breach of two &apos; D&apos; notices, was not based on anybrief by you? A. Correct.Q. Then the following day, on the Wednesday, on the 22nd February, inthe afternoon, I think Chapman Pincher telephoned you again in the afternoon,is that right? A. Yes, he probably did.Q. Did you tell him that you had been under the very greatest pressure? A. I suppose I did, yes.Q. Did you change anything you had said earlier?-A. Change it from what?Q. Change anything you may have said, any account you had given? A. No,because I went down to see Derek Marks on the Tuesday afternoon.Q. No, this is Wednesday, this is before your visit to Mr. Marks. A. Beforemy visit to Mr. Marks? No.Chairman: There was the conversation after the Prime Ministers statement in the House, on Tuesday, with Mr. Pincher?Sir Peter Rawlinson: That is so.Chairman: Is this all part of that?Sir Peter Rawlinson: No, that ends with Colonel Lohan agreeing that he told Pincher that the statement that certain newspapers had&quot; made a clear breach of two &apos; D &apos; notices was not based on any brief by him.Chairman: I followed that, but what followed then?Sir Peter Rawlinson: Another conversation on Wednesday afternoon.Chairman: With Mr. Pincher, not Mr. Marks?Sir Peter Rawlinson: First of all on the telephone, Mr. Pincher to colonel lohan, before your visit to Mr. Marks? A. Yes.Q. When, I suggested, you said you had been under the greatest pressure? A. I agree, I had been under pressure, yes but pressure to do what?Q. You can have pressure of work, but you can have pressure of peopletrying to influence you, can you not? A. Yes, but I am a difficult person to influence..Q. But had you been under pressure of influence? A. I had been asked tomake a statement as to what my reactions were, both to the thing in generaland to the article on the Wednesday morning in particular.Q. Had you seen that it had been said that there were clear breaches of two&apos; D &apos; notices? You had read that?-A. Yes.
Q. That was not your view, was it? A. No, I think whoever briefed onthat was utterly wrong. It was a wicked thing to do, because I must say thatas far as I was concerned the breach, if any, was more in the spirit than in theletter, that is why I put them aside.Chairman: I am sorry this was a telephone conversation on the Wednesday,Mr. Pincher was consulting you about statements that &apos; D&apos; notices had beenbreached ; what did you say to him? A. The conversation I had with Pincherabout the &apos; D &apos; notices was on Tuesday, surely.Sir Peter Rawlinson: That is right.Chairman: On Tuesday afternoon, after the Prime Minister&apos;s statement inthe morning, I have got all that, but I think there was another one on Wednesday-day? A. I have not had it established yet, my Lord, what it was about. Ido not know what it was about.Chairman: Then let us go into that.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: You did say, Colonel Lohan, whoever briefed on that wasutterly wrong: you mean whoever briefed the Prime Minister? A. Perhaps itis very improper of me to say so but I did not, put it that way.Sir Peter Rawlinson: But you did say that, whoever had briefed the PrimeMinister . . . A. Whoever briefed was very wrong to talk about the letter.Q. Two clear breaches of &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Yes.Chairman: Let us get this straight, which day is this?Sir Peter Rawlinson: This is Tuesday, my Lord, we went back.Chairman: This is Tuesday, but did you say that to Mr. Pincher? What isyour own view? A. When he said about the two &apos; D &apos; notices, I am slightlyconfused, we are going between Tuesdays and Wednesdays so fast we are now on the Tuesday conversation?Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes. A. The main point of the Tuesday conversationwas whether or not I had admitted that the &apos; D &apos; notices were relevant, and I donot think anything arose then very much about the Prime Minister&apos;s briefingor anything like that.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: I thought what Colonel Lohan said was that he hadbeen asked to make a statement as to his own reaction? A. Yes.Q. Then, whether he said it to anybody else, he was giving his own opinionthat whoever briefed on that, it was utterly wrong, it was a wicked thing todo?-A. Yes.Chairman: Yes, I thought I heard that. Was that you own view in answer to Sir Peter, or did it arise out of your conversations? A. I think it was in answer to Sir Peter.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes. A. This is the point, it was not part of the telephone conversation, it was Sir Peter putting a point to me, with which Iagreed.Chairman: And your comment was that you thought that to say there hadbeen clear breaches of two &apos; D&apos; notices was, to put it mildly, not at allcorrect? A. Not at all, to brief the Prime Minister to say that was not at allcorrect.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Now Wednesday: a telephone conversation withMr. Chapman Pincher, from Harrogate, I am instructed, a telephone call toyou? A. Yes.Q. This is before you see Mr. Marks. A. Yes.Q. He recollects your saying then again that you had been under greatestpressure, and that you had never suggested and would not suggest thatChapman Pincher had been wrong in any way over &apos; D&apos; notices? A. Thatis absolutely correct. I said his attitude throughout all the time I haveknown him has been always utterly correct about &apos; D&apos; notices.Chairman: Including the article on the 21st Or not? A. Saving that I think I said it wrong again, that is one where I think there was a breach of the
spirit of the &apos; D &apos; notices there, but up till that moment I quite agree thathe had been exemplary in his attitude to &apos; D &apos; notices and in his co-operation in every way.  I think the spirit was badly dented on that day.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I am going to suggest to you that you never put thatsaving clause in when you spoke to Mr. Pincher on the afternoon of the 22ndFebruary? A. I do not think I did, at the time.Q. Now we come to the meeting between yourself and the editor, it was arranged with you telephoning the editor? A. Yes.Q. And asking if you could see him, and he said: &quot; Come along tomy office &quot;, and you came to his office about 6.20 p.m. on Wednesday, 22ndFebruary? A. Yes.Q. When you arrived at his office, did you say you had come to make two points, do you recollect saying that? A. Yes.Q. And the first was that you had categorically told Pincher on Thursdaythat the &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply? A. No, I must put it the way that I did say it to him, and it was this: &quot; I have come to make it absolutely clear,I am not changing my mind for anybody about this at all&quot;, that when I showedHarry that is Harry Chapman Pincher the two &apos; D &apos; notices, and we went into some argument about it, I said: &quot; All right, let us put them aside and get down to basic issues &quot;. This I repeated to him, actually, word for word,otherwise we would never have got on at all. The reason why I say this isnot a matter of pedantry or pedantics or semantics or anything like that,it is exactly what was in my mind, that they had to be set aside otherwisePincher and I would have gone on arguing about words.Q. I must put this to you quite shortly: Mr. Marks is going to say youmade two points, first you said you told Pincher on Thursday that the &apos; D &apos;notices did not apply? A. This is true.Q. And you stood by that? A. This is true.Q. The second point Mr. Marks says you made was that you had latertold Pincher that in your view the matter could be claimed to be under &apos; D &apos;,but that it was a perfectly tenable view, as appeared in The Times that veryday, that it did not? A. I said it was a matter of opinion, yes indeed.Q. And because of that you had argued with Pincher on the Mondaylunch in the restaurant on the basis of putting the &apos; D &apos; notices on one side? A.This is so.Q. Very well. Then did the editor ask you if Pincher could or had written apiece on Wednesday, the 22nd? A. Oh yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Perhaps you had better have it before you. I donot know if you have copies, my lord?Chairman:   Yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Did he ask you if you had any objections to Pincher&apos;sstory, which appeared, you see, under the heading &quot; A charge refuted&quot; onWednesday, the 22nd? There was a copy on the file, and he asked you ifyou had any objections to that story? Did you say you did not accept, inparagraph 3 where Pincher wrote: &quot; Neither D could reasonably be applied. . .&quot;? A. Yes, I said I could not accept this.Q. That &quot; Neither could reasonably be applied to the matter in question &quot;? A. Yes, I said I objected te that.Q. Now, on paragraph 4, you said you&apos; would have preferred Pincherto have said he used all his powers of persuasion in the spirit of the &apos; D&apos;notice? A. Yes.Q. I think you also said you prepared the original answer to the parliamentary question, but had not been consulted on the question of the two clear breaches of &apos; D &apos; notices? A. I had nothing to do with it at all. May I explain, mylord, that the Prime Minister was answering a question which had been onthe Order Paper for three or four weeks, from a Conservative Member,
about how many &apos; D&apos; notices had been issued within certain periods.   I had prepared that answer, then the rest was tacked on to that.Chairman:   Yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: So much for the detailed story, Colonel Lohan. I justwant to know because I must I think get it from you if the view held bysenior executives in the Daily Express and others is correct with regard to the&apos; D &apos; notice, as you have been talking about the spirit of it: is it right that ifthe secretary says a &apos; D&apos; notice applies, then the editors, unless they are goingto break it completely, accept that, and argue about it afterwards, or evenargue in the course of an evening about it? A. By and large, yes.Q. But if it comes from you that a &apos; D &apos; notice applies, that is accepted? A. Two or three papers have deliberately broken it, quite deliberately, but thatis the usual.Q. But if a &apos; D &apos; notice does not apply, it cannot be said to fall within a &apos; D &apos;notice, then it sometimes happens that you can get hold of two members ofthe committee, the two press members, and as it were make an applicationof a &apos; D &apos; notice in an emergency? A. Yes.Q. So the procedure is: if no &apos; D &apos; notice actually fits this particular storyyou can get hold of the two press members of your committee and then you can slap on, as it were, the effect of a &apos; D &apos; notice? A. What is in effect a&apos; D &apos; notice, yes. Usually, without the full committee, they must have a basis in some existing &apos; D&apos; notice a basis, however remote. Only once have wehad an occasion my lord, to illustrate that there is a difference from what Ithink Sir Peter is getting at, which is the P &amp; C letters, I think you mentionedthem in your original report-we have in fact on . . . where there was no basis in any existing &apos; D&apos; notice whatsoever, made a special plea, and it has beenvery well honoured. But normally a P &amp; C letter must have a basis, must havea root in a &apos; D &apos; notice.Q. Yes, so this is what editors can expect. I want to see if you would agree with what Mr. Pickering, who was a director of I.P.C. and the editorialdirector of the Daily Mirror, is going to say: he is going to say that when a story has been under discussion between the defence correspondent and thesecretary for several days, where there has been no Private and Confidentialletter to the editor and where there had been plenty of opportunity to deliverone, in Mr. Pickering&apos;s view then the matter is a matter for the editor&apos;s discretion,and there is no bar on it? A. Yes. This presupposes something which has never happened, and that is that a Private and Confidential letter goes to aneditor. A Private and Confidential letter has never gone to an editor, exceptwhen there has been a breach of a &apos; D&apos; notice or something like that, but ifwe have a P &amp; C letter we put it out to several agencies, it must go to the lot.Q. Look at it in this case, then, Colonel Lohan: Daily Mail interested,Daily Express interested, you had some talk about the foreign press; whywas not a Private and Confidential letter sent, if this was within the spiritof the &apos; D &apos; notice but outside the letter of the &apos; D &apos; notice?-A. Well, backagain to this thing which happened on the 11th June, 1963, the Anatoli Dolnytsincase, where again I think the Express was involved; the Daily Telegraph hadwhat they thought was an absolutely exclusive story. I made an appeal to the editor, and he said: &quot; All right, I will certainly hold up publication &quot;. My com-mittee insisted that I sent out a P &amp; C message, through the Press Associationtapes, putting a blanket on any stories about this gentleman, Anatoli Dolnytsin.The result was that the editor of the Daily Telegraph rang me up and said:&quot; You have now given our story, which we had exclusively, to every single paper in Fleet Street. I am now going to publish &quot;. And it certainly passed throughmy mind that I should think of this procedure in this particular case, that hereI would be once again doing the same thing, which my committee have neverforgotten, and for which I have never really been forgiven, since it got them intotremendous trouble. As I say, I sent this thing out about the Anatoli Dolnytsincase under instructions, very firm instructions, and I would have landed myselfin exactly the same position vis-a-vis my committee, with no support at all.
They would never tolerate this again, putting out a blanket stop on a storythat had been held by other papers as exclusive.Q. But this was not an exclusive story, was it? You had seen the Mail, andthe Mail had consented, in the exercise of their editor&apos;s discretion, to do as youwished, and the Express you were uncertain about, certainly to begin with. Whywas it not possible then to put out a P &amp; C? A. There certainly would not betime to put out a Private and Confidential letter, I could only put it out throughP.A.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Is the question of a Private and Confidential letter aquestion for the editor of the Express alone, or to all?Sir Peter Rawlinson: First of all to the editor alone, that would be just a personal one from you? A. One from me.Q. A Private and Confidential letter from two members of the committeewould have gone to all editors? A. To all editors.Chairman: But do you not speak of Private and Confidential letters as part ofthe &apos; D &apos; notice system? You must be thinking of something which has a generalcirculation? A. It has a general circulation. I would certainly in no circum-stances write to an editor, I would have gone to see him, and if it had beenanother paper I would have gone to see the editor long before. If I had done it asa general thing and put out a P &amp; C message you could not have done a letter,because there was not time I would then have had the same thing wrappedround my neck as I had in the case of Anatoli Dolnytsin, that I had given an exclusive story to every newspaper which was worth while.Q. I do not for the moment see the difficulty there. A story must originatewith one or more newspapers, it cannot be common to every newspaper at once.If you think it is within the borderline of being covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice, butnot clearly so, is there anything wrong in getting your press representatives toagree that it should be covered by a special message to everybody? A. No.Q. The fact that you are killing it in the hands of one or more newspapers . . .-A. ... is probably giving somebody else his opportunity to do the story, butI am absolutely certain that the members of the committee and to show I am not just making it up, I could submit as evidence, if you wanted it, the minutes oftwo special meetings in which they declared that this would never never happenagain, they would never put out a general P &amp; C message to stop a story whichwas already in the hands of a pair of papers they would never do it again,would never authorise it.Mr. Shinwell: To what extent did you rely, in the course of your proceedings,on your friendship with Pincher, and your belief I would not put it higherthan that that he was not going to proceed with the story, and that he would accept what you had said to him through the editor and the story would notbe published? A. If I understand you correctly, sir one hundred per cent., butnot relying on him as a friend to do me a friendly gesture. As a matter of fact when he and I are discussing business we are not friends, we are secretary and correspondent, but I had utter faith that he would represent the case properly,and relied on him, from past performance, that he would certainly representeverything in the way I wished it to be represented.Sir Peter Rawlinson: But he had told you, just as you left, that if he was the editor, because of public interest and the general nature of this interception, hewould print? A. I thought it was the other way round, that he said to me.Q. Certainly, he said it to you. I suggest he said: &quot;If I, Chapman Pincher,was editor, I can tell you, I feel so strongly about this, I would print&quot;?-A. No,he left me with the feeling that on balance, if it was in his gift, he would not publish if it was in his gift, which it was not.Q. But you have told us he got very excited, very angry, very emphatic, inthe restaurant, and he was angry and excited, was he not, because he thought,rightly or wrongly, this was a very grave interception? A. Two bursts of anger,not angry all the time.
Q. No, of course not. But you are two friends having lunch together; whenit comes to this point he gets very emphatic, does he not? A. Yes, about thequestion of personal liberty and over the question of newspapers being snoopedupon.Q. You are not going to tell the committee, are you, that when he left youyou thought he was going to talk to the editor and not keep the same feeling ofresentment about interference with privacy? A. Mr. Pincher himself will say,I am sure, without any equivocation whatsoever, that he said he would faithfullyrepresent my point of view to the editor, and my point of view was that it wasnot in the public interest to publish that story, from which there could be nodeviation.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: He ended up by saying that if he was the editor . . . ? A.Yes.Q. You are now anticipating what Mr. Pincher is going to say? A. I am surehe will, he will not deviate from the point that he promised, and I trusted him,I had no reason to think that he would not do it, to represent my point of viewthat the story should not be published, in the public interest.Chairman: Yes, but I think perhaps all that matters is that you did not think,at the end of that meeting, that you had won your case and the Daily Expresswere bound not to publish? A. I did not think I had won outright, because itwas not a question of winning, my lord.  I felt fairly confident.Q. You felt fairly confident? A. Fairly confident, because I think when Iwent to the Daily Mail I said to them: &quot; I have seen Pincher of the Express, andI am fairly confident that he will not &quot;-of course, I am not allowed to say what i said to officials, but you will see later on that I again was quite confident thathe would not, about a quarter to seven.Sir Peter Rawlinson: At quarter to seven, you say, you were quite confident.Could you not have sent out a P.A. at that time, sent out a notice saying that anycable vetting story was under &apos; D &apos; notice? A. I would never have got permissionfrom the committee to do so.Q. Could you not have got hold of two people? A. I could have got hold oftwo people, but they would never have given permission. This is not guessworkon my part, I can submit evidence to prove that this is the committees attitude.They will never touch that again, they have said so.Q. Was an alternative that the department concerned, whoever it might be,could have issued an announcement saying &quot;There is no truth in the cable vetting &quot;? I suppose they could, if it was not true? A. They could have done,if any department wanted to do it.Q. What powers do you say you had as secretary, under the present procedure :that you had the power to say a &apos; D&apos; notice applied, or alternatively all you could rely on was advocacy to persuade the paper not to print, is that right? A.Yes.Q. And you chose the second, advocacy? A. More emphasis on that thanthe other, I quite agree, yes.Q. I just want to get clear that the procedure in the 1962 Radcliffe Report,when in paragraph 130 at page 36 it described the matter of &apos; D &apos; notices:&quot; In very urgent cases the secretary is authorised to issue a &apos; D &apos; notice onhis own responsibility, provided that he can secure the concurrence of twopress members &quot;that is still in force? A. Yes, except that it is now three members, not two, andanother thing which has been altered there is that the members must be together,must be physically together. The rule has been altered.Q. How quickly can you get together? Is that a difficult thing to do? A. it depends. I should have thought, if I had wanted to do that that particular night,I could have got them.Q. And certainly on the Friday, when you knew a little about the story and you had looked at the &apos; D&apos; notices, certainly on the Friday you could have done
that, could you not? A. I certainly could, but I thought I had got sufficientanchor in these two &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. Very well, and you will accept that many other people quite justifiably,quite reasonably, could take a different view about whether a &apos; D &apos; notice appliedor not? A. I regret to say that I do see their point of view.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Thank you.Chairman: Then on this part of the evidence, Colonel Lohan, that is all,thank you.(The witness withdrew)Minutes of a Meeting of the Committee held in theCabinet Office on Tuesday, 14th March, 1967, at 2.15 p.m.Present:Lord Radcliffe (Chairman)Mr. E.

L. GreigChairman: At the moment I just want to get from you what you have totell us about exchanges, all I think telephone exchanges, which took place onMonday, 20th February, between you and the Daily Express representatives. Youare attached at present to the Foreign Service, are you? A. I am attached to theForeign Secretary.Q. Roughly speaking, what are you Press adviser? A. Press adviser; I am now called Special Assistant.Q. On this day, and I believe only on this day, you learnt that there was somestory that was running or likely to be published in the Daily Express the next
day which related to the Foreign Secretary or to Foreign Office affairs or securitymatters ; just tell me in your own words what you heard. A. I received a tele-phone call at about 11 or 11.30 from the Minister^ private office to say someonein the Daily Express desired to speak to the Secretary of State.Q. This is the morning? A. No sir, at 11 to 11.30 in the evening.Q. That was your first contact? A. My first contact. Normally matters con-cerning the Foreign Secretary and newspapers are passed on to me. I telephonedto the Express and asked Mr. Marks why they wished to speak to him. Mr. Markssaid there had been some misunderstanding. They had understood at one time that there was something in the paper that was covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice, butthey had combed the paper, both the Scottish editions and the English editions,very carefully and had found nothing to which a &apos; D &apos; notice could apply. then he added, &quot; There is one story about cable vetting, at one time we were suspicious of that, but we have now been assured on good authority that this is not covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice.&quot; I was a little doubtful about this ....Q. He said, &quot; There is one story we had doubts about at one time aboutcable vetting &quot;? A. Yes. I then telephoned back to the Minister^ private officeand they said there had been some communications about &apos; D&apos; notices, and theyunderstood that the Foreign Secretary had spoken to Sir Max Aitken. I thentelephoned the Foreign Secretary, and he instructed me to impress on Mr.Marks that the story was covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice and also to insist that a promise given by Sir Max Aitken should be adhered to and the story not printed.Q. What really matters to us is what you passed on to Marks and what hesaid to you ; but you had these instructions from the Foreign Secretary? A. Yes.Mr. Marks said ....Q. You then rang up Mr. Marks? A. I rang Mr. Marks again. He saidthis story was not covered by any &apos; D &apos; notice, and that there had been no promise that he knew of by Sir Max Aitken.Q. Can you give us the time of this? A. This would be about I think quarterto twelve ; round about that time, I imagine.Q. Not covered by &apos; D&apos; notice; no promise. A. No promise. I repeatedthis back to the Foreign Secretary who asked me to go back to Mr. Marksand, while again drawing attention to the &apos; D&apos; notice, to emphasise that he felt in view of good relations in future Sir Max Aitken&apos;s promise must be kept,which I did.Q. So you rang up Mr. Marks again? A. Again, the second time.Q. This is about midnight? A. This would be about midnight, or a little later.Q. And you said to Mr. Marks . . . A. I repeated the Secretary of Stateagain asked me to emphasise there were &apos; D&apos; notices coyering this, and that sir Max Aitken&apos;s promise must be kept that is the promise to keep the storyout of the paper.Q. Did you say something about future relations? A. The Secretary of Statedid mention in view of good relations would I emphasise this. A point arose.The Secretary of State said Sir Max Aitken had told him, &quot; Mr. Marks is by my side ; I will see this is carried out.&quot; Mr. Marks told me this was not trueand that Sir Max had been in a box and he did not know of the call; he did not know what happened.Q. Mr. Marks said to you on this occasion on the telephone that he had notheard the conversation taking place between Sir Max Aitken and Mr. Brown? A. Yes, Sir Max had been in a box.Q. And that was all, was it? A. No, some time later, I think it must havebeen probably about quarter to one, Mr. Marks telephoned and said that they now accepted there was a &apos; D &apos; notice. He could have said &quot; accepted there was a&apos; D &apos; notice,&quot; or &quot; accepted our view &quot;, I am not quite sure which, and he wouldtake the story out of the paper. I pointed out that the damage had been done.*Q. He was accepting your view? A. Accepting our view.Q. That a &apos; D &apos; notice did I suppose cover the story? A. Yes.
Q. And was taking it out of the paper? A. Out of the paper. He was eitheraccepting the fact that there was a &apos; D &apos; notice covering it or accepting our view,I am not sure which. I pointed out it was rather late and probably 2 millioncopies would have been printed. We had a short conversation. About five toten minutes later Mr. Marks telephoned again and said, &quot;The same story is inthe Mail, it is in The Times; they took it from us ; we are going to go onprinting it; we cannot be the only paper not to have it.&quot; He then added I think,&quot; If the Foreign Secretary wants anything in the Express again he had better ringme up himself.&quot; And that was the end of the conversation.Q. That was the last exchange? A. That was the last exchange.Questioned by Sir Peter rawlinson. May I ask you a general matter first? Before you were attached to theForeign Office you were, were you not, in the lobby? A. Yes.Q. The doyen almost of the lobby correspondents? A. Not quite, but nearly.Q. In 1957 you remember there was a Privy Councillor Committee headed by Lord Birkett about telephone tapping; were you in the lobby at that time? A. I would be, yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Can I show you a copy of that because I want to ask youone or two matters. My lord, this is the Security Procedures in the Public Service,1957, and I am going to refer to one or two paragraphs.Chairman: We might as well call it the Birkett Report.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes, it is dated October, 1957. Would you turn to page29, paragraph 133, Mr. Greig? A. Yes, I have it.Q. I am going to refer you to certain passages. Paragraph 133 reads:  &quot; There is no doubt that the interception of communications, whether bythe opening or reading of letters or telegrams, or by listening to and record-ing telephone conversations, is regarded with general disfavour.&quot;Do you see that was recorded there? A. Yes.Q. A little further down, about twelve lines from the bottom, there is the sentence:  &quot;We think it important to emphasise this aversion to the interception of communications, for just as the wise administration of the criminal law must depend finally upon the support and approval of public opinion so theprinciples by which the law is enforced must win the same approval if theyare to be exercised effectively and without public unrest.&quot;Do you see that? A. Yes, I see that.Q. And then over the page, page 30:  &quot;... we have reminded ourselves at all times that the liberty of the subject was involved, and that there was considerable opposition to any use of methods of intercepting communications for any purpose, public or private.&quot;Do you see that? A. Yes.Q. Then on page 31, the last sentence of the first paragraph, about eight linesdown:  &quot; It is therefore most important to observe that from the evidence tendered to us, it is plain that the exercise of the power to intercept communicationsby the Secretary of State has never been regarded as a general power, but asa power, carefully restricted to special and well-defined circumstances and purposes, and hedged about with clearly formulated rules and subject tovery special safeguards.&quot;Then over the page, page 32, paragraph 141, the second main sentence, about half-way down:  &quot;It is important to note that it is no general power that is exercised,but one limited expressly to the cases where there is reasonable cause tobelieve that subversive activities are already being carried on.&quot;
Then if you would turn back to page 26, paragraph 119 at the bottom-have youIgot that? A. I have that, yes.Q. That reads:  &quot; In our view public concern may be in some degree allayed by knowledgeof the actual extent of the interception of letters and telephone messageswhich has been exercised on a much smaller scale than many people seemto have thought.&quot;I just brought this to your attention because I would like your comments from your experience really as a newspaper man. A. I am not sure that I can give any comment on this at all.  I am here to give evidence.Q. I am going to ask you some questions, Mr. Greig, if I may. You would agree&apos; would you not, that the general view and quite reasonable view of a newspaper man is that there is general public interest and perhaps disfavourin the interception of letters, telegrams and telephone calls, as a general matter? A. I must ask, my Lord, if I should be questioned on this. I am here fromthe Foreign Office and not here as a newspaper man.Chairman: Sir Peter, you can say anything you want to say to us on thegeneral issues, but really you have come here in order to deal with this disputedquestion of fact as to what passed.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Mr. Marks was talking to an old friend who had beena lobby correspondent in the House of Commons for very many years, whomust have appreciated clearly that here was a matter which would be ofgeneral public interest and public concern which it would be the duty of aneditor to take into account, as opposed to what was being said to him at this time that this was contrary to &apos; D &apos; notices, when he had previously been told&apos; D &apos; notices did not apply. Therefore, my Lord, the relevance of these questionsis that Mr. Greig himself must have appreciated, I would suggest to him, inthe course of their conversations, he must have known, that unless a &apos; D&apos; noticereally did fix on this story the editor obviously would want to publish this inthe public interest.Chairman: I am quite ready personally to assume he may well have thoughtthat, but really we want to get to the question of what passed which is saidto be in dispute between the people who argue this on what I call the two sides.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Very well, then I will ask you, Mr. Greig, what isyour position? What are you in fact? You are attached, are you, to theForeign Secretary? A. I am attached to the Foreign Secretary.Q. Are you an official of the Foreign Office? A. This is rather difficult to answer.   I am in fact not paid ; I am one of the few &quot; dollar a year &quot; men.Q. Your position is that of a special assistant, unpaid? A. Special assistant,unpaid, as a very old friend.Q. A very old friend of the Foreign Secretary? A. Thabis right.Q. But having no particular position with regard to security or with regardto Foreign Office detailed matters, would that be right? A. That is quitecorrect.Q. More in public relations? A. In any way the Foreign Secretary cares touse me.Q. It is right, is it not, Mr. Greig, that when Mr. Marks was speaking toyou he would be speaking to someone who was an old newspaper friend, isthat not right? A. That is quite true.Q. And someone who v/as not on the security side of the Foreign Office? A. That is right.Q. And it was you then I think the suggestion was it was certainly after10.45 not any other official from the Foreign Office who telephoned to Mr.Marks, having heard that he had been in touch with the Foreign Office?-A. That is right.Q. Is it not right that what the editor said to you was that he explained whatthe position was with regard to the story about cables and he said that this
story was not covered by &apos; D &apos; notices because it had been cleared ; is that what he said? A. I am not sure whether he said it had been cleared.   He said theyMfk.now felt certain it was not covered by a &apos;D&apos; notice.   I do not remember him^SPsaying it was cleared.Q. Anyway, he was making clear his position v/as that the story was not under ban by &apos; D &apos; notice? A. That was his view, yes.Q. And did you say obviously then that the Foreign Secretary was under amisapprehension? You had not spoken to the Foreign Secretary? A. Not atthe time.Q. But you said the Foreign Secretary must be under a misapprehension andtherefore Mr. Marks should not worry did you say something like that? A. I was not aware what the story was until the last moment. I could hardlyhave said that without consulting the Foreign Secretary. The fact I wentstraight to the Foreign Secretary reporting that there was something curiousabout this shows I would not be likely to make that remark.Q. You got a message, as I understand it, that the Express had been on to theForeign Office to find the Foreign Secretary? A. Yes.Q. You ring back the Express! A. Yes.Q. And the editor just tells you that queries had arisen about a cable story? A. No, I did not say that. He said that a story had appeared they wished tocover by &apos; D &apos; notice, and cable vetting was an afterthought.Q. He did say cable vetting?-A. At the end of the conversation.Q. You knew when he rang up they were talking about the cable vettingstory? A. That is right.Q. You knew Mr. Marks was saying, whether it was right or wrong, definitelysaying this was cleared for &apos; D &apos; notices? A. That is right, yes.Q. Then you said after that conversation you telephoned back to the privateoffice? A. Yes.Q. Having telephoned back to the private office you then spoke again to Mr.Marks, do you recollect? A. I think the order is wrong. I spoke to privateoffice, to Mr. Marks and then to the Foreign Secretary.Q. I beg your pardon, yes.   Having spoken to the Foreign Secretary, youthen telephoned to the editor and spoke to Mr. Marks? A. Yes.Q. Did you say to Mr. Marks that the Foreign Secretary was in a great rage,threatenning all sorts of things, or words to that effect? A. I said he was veryangry.Q. Did you say that the Foreign Secretary had said he would ring Mr. CecilKing, the Chairman of the N.P.A., and complain that Sir Max had broken hisword? A. That is correct, yes.Q. And did the editor say to you, &quot; There is no question of that since allthat Sir Max said was that the story would be stopped if it was under a&apos; D &apos; notice &quot;? Is that what the editor said? A. No, he said he did not know what took place between Sir Max and the Foreign Secretary.Chairman: Just get it quite clear ; the simple question is, did he say thatto you? A. No.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Then I must go on putting to you, Mr. Greig, as you must appreciate, what Mr. Marks says here. After he said to you, &quot; There isno question of that since all Sir Max said was that the story would be stoppedif it was under a &apos; D &apos; notice &quot;, you said you were sure it was under &apos; D &apos; notice. A. No, I gave him the dates of two &apos; D &apos; notices. I had been supplied withthe dates by the private office. I had not even seen them myself so I couldnot try to interpret them anyway.Q. I suggest the first thing that happened was that he asked you if you were sure it was under &apos; D &apos; notice and he asked you which &apos; D &apos;&apos; notices applied? A. And I gave him the dates of two &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. And you said it was specifically under those two &apos;D&apos; notices?-r-A: No.
Q. Mr. Marks recollects that in some conversation or another you certainlyquoted April, 1956 and October, 1961 &apos; D &apos; notices.-A. Yes.Q. We come to the later telephone conversation where he told you about his decision to stop the story. Is it right that what the editor said to you was that,despite his opinion that no &apos; D&apos; notice applied, and despite the fact that he believed that Chapman Pincher had told him the truth, but in the light of what you had said, and in the light of Sir Max&apos;s undertaking to remove any storyif it was under &apos; D &apos; notice, he, the editor, decided to take the story out, isthat right? A. I hardly recall the exact words, but the conversation startedoff by Marks saying that never in his experience before had the Express failed to observe a &apos; D &apos; notice, and this was certainly not going to happen now. We had some little conversation, I cannot quite remember how it went. Forgive me forsaying this was early morning, I had been asleep, and I was sitting up in bed.Q. There is a little difference in recollection. Was he saying to the effect, &quot; Istill believe &apos; D&apos; notices do not apply, but you say they do, and in the lightthen of that, and the fact that Sir Max has given this undertaking to the foreign secretary, I am going to stop the story.&quot;? A. I am sorry, I cannot rememberSir Max being mentioned in the third conversation.Q. Might he have been? A. He might have been, I just cannot remember.I was not taking any notes at the time.Q. Then between 12.46 and 1 o&apos;clock in the morning, I am now coming to another telephone conversation ; the editor telephoning you. Did he tell you that Colonel Lohan had just told him that Lohan could not stop anybody elsepublishing and that Lohan knew that the Mail and The Times were going to print something like that? A. Lohan was mentioned, I forget exactly in whatcontext.  Lohan was certainly mentioned.Q. And were the Mail and The Times mentioned? A. The Mail and the times were mentioned, yes.Q. Did the editor, Mr. Marks, say that therefore this created an entirely new situation and obviously the editor, Mr. Marks, could not take the story out ofthe Express? A. I accept that.Chairman: I am sorry, I have not got quite clear what that was. Is it being put that Mr. Marks in this telephone conversation said the Mail and The Timeswere printing a story and therefore he could not hold back?Sir Peter Rawlinson: This story.Chairman: Printing this story, the cable vetting story, and therefore he couldnot hold back, or that Colonel Lohan had just admitted to him that he couldnot prevent the Mail and The Times from printing?Sir Peter Rawlinson: The second, my lord. What is being put to Mr. Greigis that Mr. Marks said Colonel Lohan had just told him, Mr. Marks, thatLohan could not stop anybody else publishing, and that Lohan knew that theMail and The Times were going to print.Chairman: I see, yes.Mr. Shinwell: Could we get the actual time of that?Sir Peter Rawlinson: We know it must have been after 12.46, because thatwas when we had a timed call to Kent.  It must be between 12.46 and 1 o&apos;clock.Mr. Shinwell: That is 12.46 a.m.?Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes.Mr. Shinwell: Had the story not been published in one of the editionsbefore that?Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes, it had been published. Then came preparations to stop, and various steps were taken to stop. Then comes the telephone conversa-tion between the editor and Colonel Lohan when the Mail and The Times, he istold, were going to print. Then comes this telephone conversation with Mr.Greig, and then very shortly after the Mail and The Times arrived on the editor&apos;sdesk with of course the story in. I just want to finish this conversation, Mr. Greig.
Before he ended did the editor say to you that whatever else was said about thismatter there was no question of Sir Max having broken his word?   Do yovdremember him saying that? A. Yes, I believe he did say that. ^Q. And did you say that you would make that clear to the Foreign secretary in the morning? A. Yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: That is all. A. Could I make one point? When I saidthat I was not a civil servant, I am to the extent that I have accepted all theinhibitions of the civil servant and all the restrictions which apply to civil servants,and that has been made clear. The reasons why I do not accept a salary aremy own personal affair.Chairman: There is just one thing I want to ask you arising out of that lastquestion to you. You said in the morning you would make it clear to the foreign secretary that Sir Max had not broken his word? A. I think I said I wouldconvey this to the Foreign Secretary.Q. What were you going to convey? A. What Marks had said to me, obviouslyreporting back again, which I did in a minute first thing in the morning.Q. Because your line had been, as I understand it, earlier on that Sir Maxwas bound by a promise not to publish? A. I was not in any way going back onthat, I simply said I would inform the Foreign Secretary what Marks had saidto me, no more than that. I was in the position of being a communications postin this, nothing more.Mr. Shinwell: When did you first telephone Mr. Marks on the Monday? A. Ishould think about 11.30 on the Monday evening.Q. What did he say to you then? A. First of all he said there was some misunderstanding ; that they had believed at one time earlier that some storyin the paper was covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice. They had gone through with acomb, they had combed through the Scottish editions and the London editionsand had found nothing. Then, almost as an afterthought, they said therewas a cable vetting story but they had cleared that all right some remark like that. It was this which led me to telephone the private office and ask if anysuch matter had been raised during the day.Q. Were you aware at that time, at 11.30, that the story had been published in the Glasgow edition? A. I was aware, because Mr. Marks told me it was runnin in London and in Glasgow at that time.Q. But you proceeded to discuss with him whether the story should bepublished? A. No, the story was published.Q. What was the purpose of talking to him then? A. Because when Itelephoned I knew nothing of this. The message was passed on to me from theprivate office in the belief that this was some political matter. I knew nothingabout the story until I telephoned Mr. Marks.Q. Now you know, was it not rather strange that you were engaged in discussionwhether it should be published and yet the story had been published? A. Therewas no discussion whether it should be published: it was published. I had no discussion on that. Having got the story from Mr. Marks I went to the foreign secretary and asked for instructions.Q. Were you aware at 11.30 when you spoke to Mr. Marks that other newspapershad decided not to publish the story? A. I knew nothing about it then. I wasunder the impression they were running some story about the Foreign Secretary,his personal affairs.Q. Several questions were put to you by counsel on this document. Could Idirect your attention to page 22 paragraph 141, the last sentence:&quot;We are further satisfied from the evidence before us that the methodsof interception hitherto employed are necessary and even productive ofimportant results which could not have been obtained in any other way.&quot;You take note of that? A. I will take note of it. I can make no comment on it, no comment at all.Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Greig ; that is all.(The witness withdrew)
Evidence of Mr. George BrownChairman: Mr. Brown, I really want to get from you simply the evidence you can give about what passed between you and Sir Max Aitken on the telephoneon the evening of Monday, 20th February. I understand I do not think thereis any dispute about this that you were dining with a friend and information was conveyed to you from the Foreign Office that there was some story runningin the Daily Express for printing the next day which affected the interception of telegrams, is that right? A. That is right. I had heard about this twice already.I heard about it in the early part of the evening. I had in fact wondered thenwhether I should intervene or not and took departmental advice not to. I was told, as I have said to you in writing, somewhere around 10 o&apos;clock on the telephone that communication had broken down and that the Express wereintending to print the story. For reasons I need not go into in present companyit seemed to me to be a rather dangerous thing to do, and I then rang Sir MaxAitken whom I know and with whom I had been anyhow at a very friendly lunchshortly before. It was a very short conversation.Q. Where did you get him? At the Express office? A. At the Express office.It was a very short conversation. I began by saying, &quot; I want to talk to youabout a story if I may which I am told you are proposing to run tonight.&quot; Hesaid, &quot; Please &quot;, or something to that effect. He also said, and this I am absolutelyclear about, &quot; I have Derek Marks by my side.&quot; I am absolutely clear about thewords he used. I explained to him as nearly as one could on an open telephonethat this was a dangerous story it seemed to me for public security, and I saidto him and I have no doubt about this at all &quot; And it is covered anyway bya &apos; D &apos; notice, and the reason for this is because the area into which the storywill take you is specially dangerous for the security of our country.&quot; the conversation was not much longer than that, and Sir Max Aitken said, and Ihave absolutely no doubt at all about what he said, &quot; Very well, I will kill the story.&quot; I would like those words to be in quotes, because I have absolutely nodoubt in my mind at all, neither then nor now, about what he said &quot; Very well &quot;,said he, &quot; I will kill the story &quot;. At that point the conversation ended.Q. You are quite clear that those words, &quot; Very well, I will kill the story &quot;,stood by themselves without additions or qualifications? A. Without additionsor qualifications. The conversation ended. I said, &quot; Thank you very much &quot;,or &quot; I am sure this is right.&quot; I think, although here I am not as clear, but Ibelieve I said to him, &quot; If you want to talk to me I will tell you more about thisthan I can do over the telephone.&quot; I am pretty sure I also said that, but thatis where the conversation ended.Q. In other words, you offered him some background if he wanted to cometo you for it? A. Yes.Q. And after that, Mr. Brown, you had no further,part in exchanges betweenthe government and the press? A. No, I was subsequently rung up by a seniorofficial of my department who said it was still running. I was then rung up bythe witness in whose evidence you have interposed mine (Mr. Greig), who said he had been rung up by the editor who wanted to talk to me, but from then on it was dealt with by him and I never came into it at all.Q. I think that is all you can contribute on the question of exchanges betweenthe government and the Express. A. Yes.Questioned by Sir Peter rawlinson. What time was it, Foreign Secretary, that you heard about the story earlier in the evening, approximately? A. I first of all heard about it on the Fridayevening when I received a minute from my department which set out what was going on. This minute I believe is in the possession of the court. I did nothing more at that moment than note it. I heard at 7 o&apos;clock on the Monday eveningI think at any rate the evening of the day in question I heard that it seemedas though the Express might be going to publish.Q. I must ask you this generally. It is going to be said that it was said toMr. Pincher that one of the objections to the story was that the embassies might
make a furore because their telegrams would be intercepted. Was anything either on Friday or Monday talked about on that line? A. Nothing at all.  The only thing that was talked about in the minute which the court has, or in the\^yconversation I had with my department on the Monday evening, was the dangerit might do to quite important areas for which I have departmental responsibility.Q. Did you know anything of the detail of the story when you spoke toSir Max, details as to the cables, the telegrams and from where they were collected? A. Very shortly after I became the Minister I was told all about this procedure, as my predecessor had been told. I had personally authorised itto continue, so I knew the details anyway, but I was also told that evening,indeed I was told in the minute, that photographs had been taken of vans whichcould be identified as to whom they belonged. This is really what bothered meabout the whole thing.Q. You really knew when you spoke to Sir Max I appreciate you were on an open telephone you really knew quite a considerable amount about the back-ground of the story? A. Yes, and I assumed him to assume that I would not betalking to him unless I did.Q. Did you know when you spoke to him that he was in the Garrick Club ata dinner for Trevor Evans I know the line could be switched through from the express! A. That must have happened.  All I did was to telephone the Express.Chairman: You rang the Express! A. I rang the Express. Where he was when spoke to him was never conveyed to me. Maybe the Express should have saidto me, &quot; I am putting you through to the Garrick &quot;, but they did not say that.Sir Peter Rawlinson: With respect, I am certainly not making any criticism ;I just wanted to make sure you did not know he was at the Garrick Club. A. Sir Peter, what he said to me was, &quot; I am here and I have Mr. Marks by myside.&quot; I had called the Express ; it was up to him to say to me, &quot; I am somewhereelse &quot;, but he did not.Q. Might he have said, &quot; I am here, Derek Marks is with me &quot; ? A. No, no.I know exactly the words he said ; he said &quot; I have Derek Marks by my side &quot;.Q. Did you know that he was speaking from a telephone box? A. No, nor did he tell me.Q. You know the size of Mr. Marks? A. Nor did he tell me, and &quot;DerekMarks by my side &quot; conveyed to me that I had got him -in the office he uses atthe Express and that Derek Marks was there. What else could it convey?Q. Very well. A. It is no good saying &quot; Very well&quot; what else could itconvey?Q. Very well. Foreign Secretary, I am going to put to you, as I have to, whatSir Max&apos;s recollection of what happened is. He said when you spoke you said the Express were running a story in Glasgow which was under a &apos; D&apos; notice andwould Sir Max do something about it. That is what he recollects as the beginningpart of the conversation. A. It was a good deal longer before I knew, somehours later, they were running it in Glasgow. What I was told was that they were running the story, and what I said to him is &quot;Your papers are running a storywhich is under a &apos; D &apos; notice &quot;, and I did as much as I could on the open telephoneto explain to him why it was bad.Q. Do you think you did mention Glasgow at all when you spoke at 10.10? A. I do not think so.  I cannot really think that I could have mentioned Glasgow.Q. You did not say anything to the effect that it is now or very shortly willbe on the streets in Glasgow and it is contravening a &apos; D&apos; notice? A. I am sureI said it is contravening a &apos; D * notice ; that I have no doubt about at all. I have very grave doubts whether I said anything about Glasgow. Does it matter if I did? Is not the essential thing that they were contravening a &apos; D &apos; notice?Q. I just have to put to you, you see, what Sir Max is going to say. I am sureyou will understand that. Sir Max recollects when you said this about runninga story he says he thought you said running in Glasgow you asked him to do something about it. That you both agree about? A. Yes, I asked him to stop it.
Q. Did he reply that he did not know what the story was but if it werecontravening a &apos; D&apos; notice he would have the story taken out? A. I do notremember the first half. The words I do remember were &quot; If we are contraveninga &apos; D &apos; notice I will kill the story.&quot; The &quot; if&apos; was not the operative thing. He.said &quot; I will kill the story &quot;, and very firmly.Q. In case there is any doubt about it, I must suggest to you that his recollectionis that he said, &quot; If we are contravening a &apos; D &apos; notice I will take the story out.&quot; A. That may be his recollection. I have not the slightest doubt, because theonly person I spoke to immediately afterwards was my wife, and I said, &quot; Thankheaven he has agreed to kill the story.&quot; I had no doubt in my mind ; I have nodoubt now what he agreed to do.Q. He did make it clear to you, did he not, that he did not know what the story was to which you were referring? A. He did not say that at all. He didnot even discuss that. He listened to what I had to say and he said, &quot; Very well&quot;,so far as I can recall the exact words, but whoever remembers the exact words? so far as I can recall the exact words he said, &quot; Very well, I will kill the story &quot;,and I did not come away from the telephone with any suggestion of ifs or butsor &quot; I will find out&quot;. If I may say so, the call a good deal later from the editorof the Express to Mr. Greig, whom you are currently seeing, bears this out.Q. Sir Max also recollects that you also made the point that if the Expressheld the story for 24 hours the Express would get a much better story. A. No,no, no.Q. Is that not right? A. Totally untrue. If he is suggesting that, I am verysurprised, and I will be very surprised if he in fact says that. That was not what i said. It sounds to me like a distortion of what I told the court I had said, whichwas, &quot; If you want to know anything more about it come and see me and I willtell you anything more I possibly can about it.&quot;  That is a distortion of that.Q. Then he recollects saying that he explained that Derek Marks was with him and he thinks he said &quot; at the dinner &quot;, and that he, Sir Max, would speak toDerek Marks. A. Both totally untrue. He said, &quot; Derek Marks is by my side &quot;,and I repeat there was no reference to a dinner and I had every reason to think was speaking to him at the Express office.Q. Did you make any note of the conversation shortly afterwards at all? A. I made my own note for myself of course there and then. I dictated the note which is in the office, and of which you have a copy, the day afterwards.Q. Did you make a note there and then, just afterwards? A. I just scribbleddown on my thing &quot; I have talked to Max, he has agreed to kill the story.&quot; Justa very short note.Sir Peter Rawlinson: That is all, thank you, my lord.Mr. Shinwell: Are you not surprised, Foreign Secretary, when it is suggested to you that Sir Max Aitken did not know about the story in the Express, since it had been talked about since the previous Thursday? A. I am not onlysurprised, Mr. Shinwell, I just do not believe it, and this reinforces my view thathe did not say anything like that to me. He was not a bit surprised when Ispoke to him and, knowing the Express as I did, it could not possibly have been going on since before the previous Friday without Sir Max knowing what I wastalking about.Chairman: Many thanks.(The witness withdrew)Evidence of Mr. N. TaylorChairman: Mr. Taylor, as far as I understand the matter, did not have anydealings himself on this matter with the Express. He did get an enquiry from the daily Mail about the story and he gave an answer to the Mail. Very likely youwill not have anything in particular to ask him.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I am much obliged., Chairman: Mr. Taylor, you are the Chief Press Officer for the Ministry ofDefence?-Yes, sir.
Q. I want to bring you to Wednesday, 15th February. A. Yes.Q. And in your office you had a telephone enquiry from Mr. AngusMacpherson, who is the Defence Correspondent of the Daily Mail? A. I did,sir.Q. I imagine you knew him pretty well already? A. I knew him very well forseveral years, yes.Q. First of all, what was his enquiry to you about on that occasion? A. Withthe proviso that of course after this length of time one cannot be absolutelycertain of the exact words used but the gist of the conversation was that the daily Mail had had, I think he used the words &apos; a tip &apos;, but he may not have usedthose precise words, but anyway the Daily Mail had had a story that copies of overseas telegrams and telex messages were being collected by the Ministry ofDefence and delivered to the Ministry of Defence once a day for some form ofscrutiny, that after they had been seen by the Ministry of Defence for a period which was believed to be 48 hours the copies of these telegrams and telex messageswere then returned to their original source. And Angus Macpherson asked ifI knew about this and whether I could find out anything more about it.Q. At the moment of that enquiry did you know anything yourself about sucha procedure? A. Nothing whatsoever.Q. So he said, &quot; Can you tell me anything about this? &quot;, I suppose. A. Yes,and in fact because I knew nothing about it I was not able to say anything offthe cuff to him. But I did appreciate of course that if there was anything in the story it was probably a subject on which I would not be able to help to any great extent: if it were true, from one&apos;s experience we would know we would not beable to comment on it, or if it was not true even the exact form of the denial wouldprobably have to be rather carefully worded. But in any case this did not reallyarise on that particular occasion when he rang because I was so busy I should explain this was the day before the Defence White Paper was published andwe had some five separate press conferences to organise and to prepare for thefollowing day. So I had in fact to explain to Angus Macpherson that I couldnot give him an answer straight away.Q. In effect you said, &quot; I do not know anything about it. This sounds the sort of thing I might not be able to help you with. I will make an enquiry &quot;? A. Yes indeed.Q. What happened next as between yourself and Mr. Macpherson?-A. Infact nothing happened until the following day because of this Defence white paper publication. But at some time and I cannot remember, I made no record of the exact time at some time on the Thursday we had a subsequent enquiryfrom Mr. Pincher of the Daily Express. And as soon as I heard of this secondenquiry I got on to the head of the security service . . .Q. Well, we need not go into that. You went to whoever you thought wasthe right person to ask about it? A. Yes. On this-sort of subject we have aman who normally is the fund of knowledge on this sort of thing.Q. Yes. Then you made what enquiries you could, were told what you were told. And then all I want to know is what took place between yourself andMr. Macpherson. A. After the advice I had been given I rang back Mr.Macpherson about six o&apos;clock on the Thursday and said there was absolutelynothing in this story and the whole thing was nonsense. Indeed I went so far,because of the advice I had been given, to point out the rather ludicrous natureof the suggestion he made that here we were supposed to be receiving copies of telegrams sent overseas and telex messages, and it seemed rather inconceivable,that if we were involved in this we would be having sacks of these thingsdelivered. I said this because of the advice I had been given and because of one particular word which had been used in the briefing which we had been given,and that was the use of the word &quot; nonsense &quot; that the whole thing was non-sense, and that really was the substance of my conversation with Mr. Macpherson.Q. What was his reaction? A. As far as I knew at the time he had accepted this assurance from me that there was nothing in the story. Indeed he went sofar as to say this did not really surprise him because of the source from whichhe had got the story.
ft0Q. I see. Well, that was what passed between you and Macpherson of theaily Mail until Sunday the 19th is that right? A. Yes. I had no subsequentconversations with Mr. Macpherson at least on that subject until he &apos;phonedme at home on the Sunday. In fact he had been trying to get me at home theprevious day, but I had been out. I finally spoke to him some time on Sunday,and he was extremely upset because he felt, and told me that he felt, very letdown over the answer that I had given him, because he said that the secretaryof the Defence Notices Committee had been in touch with the Daily Mail, andobviously the committee would not have been involved in this approach to the daily Mail unless there was something in the story which they had originally gotand which I had originally told the Daily Mail was nonsense. Because I hadknown Mr. Macpherson for several years we had obviously more than a casualacquaintance of press officer and journalist; I trust him and he trusts me. Andtherefore when I had denied this story to him he accepted what I said as beingtrue. This is not necessarily always so between a journalist and a press officer.Therefore he felt I must have known about the background of the story and i must have intentionally misled him. I said I did not know the Defence NoticeCommittee was in any way involved in this story, I did not know it on theoccasion I had spoken to him, neither did I know of any involvement betweenthe Thursday when I had spoken to him and the Sunday when he called me.Because of his obvious embarrassment in his own office presumably he had reported my conversation to the news editor and because of his disappointmentthat I had let him down I promised I would raise this on the Monday morningwhen I returned to the office to try and find out what had gone wrong.Q. I see. You did not in fact have any further exchange with him? A. No,none at all.Q. We know in fact that Colonel Lohan was in the office of the Daily Mailon Monday? A. I am sorry when I said I had no further conversation, the conversation I had with him probably went on for 25 or 30 minutes. He didsay Colonel Lohan had been in touch with the Daily Mail, and I made a note on the Monday morning of a phrase I remembered from his conversation, sayingthat the Daily Mail had been warned off the story. This, I think, was the phrasehe used on Sunday.Questioned by Sir Peter rawlinson. Wing Commander Harris, is he one of your staff?-A. Yes, one of thepress officers under me.Q. You did not know anything about the story which you thought was non-sense. You thought the story was nonsense when you replied on Thursday? A. Yes.Q. Did you speak to Mr. Harris about Mr. Pincher&apos;s enquiry? A. whether spoke to him directly is difficult to remember precisely. If I may just digressfor a moment, on the Thursday we are talking about, this is the busiest day that we have for Defence Public Relations ; we have some 200 correspondentsinto the building on that day, and it is awfully difficult to remember preciselywho said what to whom. But I think I told Wing Commander Harris personally,although it may have gone through another member of the staff, the briefingI had had from our security people.Q. What was believed by the press office of the Ministry of Defence onThursday was that this story was nonsense? A. Oh yes, indeed. There was nodoubt about the substance of our reply. There may have been some doubt about the precise word, whether it was nonsense or ridiculous, but there wasno doubt on my part or my staffs part that we had a very clear briefing tosay this story was ridiculous.Mr. Shinweli: Does it sometimes happen, Mr. Taylor, that when you firstencounter a situation like this you or members of your staff say &quot;This isnonsense&quot; and then discover after further investigation that it is not nonsenseat all? I think I would be very naive to pretend this does not happensometimes, but the longer one spends in Government public relations I think127
the more reluctant one becomes to make this sort of remark wihout making some enquiries first, which is why I hope when the Daily Mail came to mkinitially I did not make any such statement initially, because I had no backgroundon this ; although it sounded on the face of it a most unlikely story one could not be sure occasionally it does happen that one says &quot; Oh, this reallydoes sound nonsense&quot;, but one would not normally say this unless one were very very sure of one&apos;s background, and I was not sure of my background otithis occasion. -Chairman: Many thanks.(The witness withdrew)Evidence of Wing Commander W. A. HarrisChairman: Wing Commander Harris, you I think are employed in the pressoffice of the Ministry of Defence, and Mr. Taylor we have just been hearingfrom is your chief? A. That is right, sir.Q. All I want to hear from you, at any rate at the moment, is what passed in the week with the 15th February between yourself and the Daily Express I think it is Mr. Chapman Pincher. A. Yes.Q. On &quot;this request from the Daily Express on the cable vetting story whichran on the Tuesday of the following week. Can you tell us as far as yourmemory goes about what enquiry you got and the answer?- A. Yes sir, sofar as my memory goes. A little after three o&apos;clock I cannot be exact, probablyabout a quarter past three I got an enquiry from Mr. Pincher.Q. We are on Thursday the 16th? A. Yes. I had an enquiry on the telephonefrom Mr. Pincher. He said that he had heard that cables were collected from some cable offices in London by a van, I think he said I am not positiveabout this an M.P.B.W. van, and taken to a Ministry of Defence buildingwhere they were kept for a period of I think he said 48 hours, and were after-wards returned to the cable offices. We had two conversations on this day,and I am not positive which piece of what I am saying was in which conversation.But in one or other of the conversations he made the point that the cables werenot delayed by this, that there were copies made of the cables, the cables were despatched, he thought, from the cable offices so that there was no delay whilethe cables were being looked at could I confirm&apos; that this was so. I told him that we had already had a similar enquiry from the Daily Mail this was theprevious day and he said again I am speaking from memory that he knewthis because the same man that had been to the Daily Mail the previous day had come to see him. After we had finished talking, knowing he had had this previous enquiry and Mr. Taylor had dealt with it and was asking advice on how to handle the Daily Mail enquiry, I told Mr. Taylor, and did nothing more, as I was due at two press conferences ten minutes later. And it was not until something after half past five that I was free to do anything about theenquiry. It was then that Mr. Taylor told me the line that was to be taken and I telephoned Mr. Pincher ....Q. I see. You did not make any enquiries of your own? A. None myselfat all.Q. You telephoned Mr. Pincher? A. I telephoned him and said that our people were either surprised or astounded to hear this sort of thing and that it wasludicrous. He asked me if he could quote me as saying that, and I said No,I would rather he did not quote me, but this was what I had been told I could say to him, and he seemed satisfied with that answer.Q. And that was all that passed?-A. Not quite all, sir, no. He said againI am speaking from memory, because I have no complete note of the thing he said he thought there must be something in the story even if it had nothing to do with the Ministry of Defence because he had, he thought, some confirm a-tion of it from another source, to which I said &quot;With the greatest of goodwillI cannot help you any further. You had better pursue your other source&quot;,and that was pretty well the end of the conversation.
Questioned by Sir Peter Rawlinson41 Q. It is quite clear, is it not, that Mr. Chapman Pincher spoke to you sometime after three o&apos;clock and he said he had heard cables were collected from some cable offices?   That is what he said, is it not? A. Yes.Q. Cables from cable offices. This was the story he was asking you about?-A. Yes.Q. And he said they were taken to a Ministry of Defence building wherethey were kept for 48 hours and then they were returned to the cable offices.This is what he was saying? A. Yes.Q. Then you made your enquiries and rang him back? A. Yes.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: When you spoke to Mr. Pincher in the evening of theThursday and you told him that the story was ludicrous etc., I think you saidto us that Mr. Pincher appeared to be satisfied what was the phrase you used? A. Yes, I think I said he was satisfied.Q. But then did he not go on to say something else-that he was certainthere was some substance in the story because he had had some confirmation of it from another source? A. Yes. What I mean, and what I think hemeant, is that he was satisfied that that was all I could do for him.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I am sorry. Could I put another question?Chairman: Yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: If a Ministry spokesman is asked about a subject coveredby a &apos; D &apos; notice, would he say &quot; That story is covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice &quot; ? A.It would be perfectly proper to say that if you knew it as a fact. If you ask my personal opinion I could not guarantee to be able to say that in reply to every question I get which might be covered by &apos; D &apos; notice, because I do not know them by heart.Q. If the spokesman knew they were covered by &apos; D &apos; notice he would say so,would he not? A. Yes, I think he would.Chairman: Thank you ; that is all.Chairman: Mr. 0&apos;Brien, all we want to get from you is what passed betweenyou and Mr. Chapman Pincher in February on the question of a story aboutcable vetting, collecting copies of cables from cable offices or from the G.P.O.You had some enquiry, I think, on the 15th February, did you not?--A. Yes, Ithink so.Q. You are Director of Public Relations at the GeneraljPost Office? A. Yes,that is right.Q. What enquiry did you have and what answer did you give? A. he asked me whether in fact copies of all cables were collected and taken awayto, I think if I remember rightly he said what was the old Admiralty building.And after I had checked with my colleagues I explained to him that this wasnot so, all cables did not go.Q. Did he say he was working on a story to this effect, or was it a questionout of the blue?- A. No, he said he had got a story to that effect.Q. Collected from the cable offices and taken to what he called the oldAdmiralty building? A. That is right, including our cable office.Q. And you made enquiries internally about what was going on? A. Thatis right.Q. What did you tell him? A. I told him it was not true that all cableswere so collected and taken to the Admiralty building.Q. Was that all that passed when you were giving him your reply, just onesentence like that? A. No, I do not think this could possibly be so, becauseon the question of whether it was true that all cables went I said No.(The witness withdrew)Evidence of Mr. T. A. 0&apos;Brien
Q. Did you say anything more? A. My recollection it is very difficult nowafter this period, but my recollection is that although he accepted that was truehe was not so sure this was the whole story.Questioned by Sir Peter rawlinson. Mr. 0&apos;Brien, you had two calls from Mr. Chapman Pincher that afternoon,Thursday, 16th February, did you not? A. Yes. There was one call which Ihad.  It came to me, and then I called him back.Q. Two conversations on the telephone? A. Two conversations ; the secondone was simply a response to the first call.Q. I suggest when he telephoned you the first time you said to him &quot; Thereis some substance in the story, but T will check and I will telephone you back &quot;. A. This is so, because this is something which is perfectly well known.Q. And having said there was some substance in the story but you would checkand make further enquiries you then rang off and made your enquiries and tele-phoned him back in his office at the Express! A. That is right.Q. And did you say to him on the second occasion that in fact it is not allthe cables that go but only some of them do? A. Certainly not all cables go.Q. I know. But did you say to him not all the cables go but some of themdo? A. This I think is something which everybody has known. . . .Chairman: No, Mr. 0&apos;Brien just try to recollect what you said. A. I think this would be true.Sir Peter Rawlinson: That is what you said, is it? A. Yes.Q. And his first query of course was about the collection of all cables fromcable offices, was it not? A. Yes.Q. And they were sent to the old Admiralty building? That in fact is what happens, is it not?Chairman: I think that will not really help you. A. That part I do not know.What I do know is that all our cables do go to our telephone managers offices for putting into account.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes.  Thank you.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Mr. 0&apos;Brien, you are agreed now that you said it wasnot all the cables that go but some of them, and then you said by way of ex-explanation that that is something that everybody would know. A. Yes.Q. How would they know it? A. I do not know. I do not really know the answer to that, except that this does happen.Q. The point is you are saying that it is general knowledge that this happens. A. I think it would not be general knowledge, would it? Quite a lot of people would know about it.Q. Perhaps we do not want to get too deep into it, but do you mean thereis a physical transport involved which does take place before the eyes of people? A. I want to make it quite clear that as far as we are concerned all we knowdefinitely that happens is that the copies of the cables go to our telephone man-ager&apos;s offices for being put into account.   This is the important thing.Chairman: Right.   Thank you.(The witness withdrew)Chairman: Now we have reached the point where we hear the Daily Mailwitnesses.  They are going to be represented by counsel?Mr. Hirst: Yes, my lord. My name is D. Hirst. My lord. I think it willbe most convenient for your lordship if I call them in this order: Mr. Matthewman,Mr. Macpherson, Mr. Brittenden. This is the chronology of the matter. But itis of course entirely for your lordship.Chairman: Yes, I do not mind. Now they have got you here you will want to put your questions to them?Mr. Hirst: I think it will save the committee&apos;s time if I do, my lord.
Chairman: But I have no statement.Mr. Hirst: I will hand that to your lordship now.Chairman: You will understand the sole reason we want to hear from the daily Mail is to hear their part in the production and the ultimate publicationof the cable vetting story, and in particular what exchanges took place betweenthem and any representative of the Government.Mr. Hirst: My lord, their evidence will be confined solely to that, and I quiteappreciate that.Mr. E. V. Matthewman called examined by Mr. D. HirstQ. Mr. Matthewman, is your name Eric Victor Matthewman? That is right.Q. Are you the Managing Editor of the Daily Mail! A. I am.Q. Prior to the 17th February did you know anything at all about the cable vetting story? A. No, nothing at all.Q. On the 17th February in the afternoon did you get a message from yourassistant managing editor, Mr. J. H. Spence? A. I did.Q. What was the substance of that message? A. He said that Colonel Lohanof the &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee had telephoned and wanted to talk to me. Hewas concerned about some enquiries he had heard we were making into the examination of commercial cables.   That was the substance of the message.Q. Did he add anything about Colonel Lohan&apos;s willingness to come anywhereif need be?-A. Yes, he said that he regarded it as a very important matter andthat if necessary he was quite prepared to come up from the country, from where he was telephoning, that afternoon.Q. Did you then telephone Colonel Lohan yourself at a Charing in Kentnumber? A. I did.Q. What did he say to you to start the conversation? A. He told me thathe had heard we were making enquiries into checking on all kinds of cables.He told me that he knew that a reporter whom he named, Celia Hadden, hadbeen involved in these enquiries, and he said it was important in his view that a story coming from these enquiries should not be published for security reasons ; hewas not prepared for obvious reasons to discuss the matter on the telephone, butthat obviously he would give me the detail of it if we were to meet face to face.I said that obviously I would need to make some enquiries myself, which I did.After talking with him I sent for the reporter he had named and asked whatbasically this story was all about.Q. Could you just finish the Colonel Lohan conversation first? I will ask youtwo other questions, and then we will come to your enquiries. Did he say anything about another newspaper? A. He said that another newspaper to his knowledge was making enquiries and that he had spoken to this newspaper, yes.Q. Two other questions that do not come on your proof that the committeehave. Did he say anything about &apos; D&apos; notices in that conversation? A. No,there was no mention of &apos; D&apos; notices there.Q. Secondly, did you give him the name of the Daily MaiVs informant in thatconversation? A. No, I did not. As a matter of fact I did not know it.Q. Did you then ring off and say you would make enquiries? A. I did.Mr. Hirst: And perhaps I can lead with this, because I think it is quite clear?Chairman: Yes.Mr. Hirst: Did you then speak to Celia Hadden and ask her what the storywas all about? A. Yes.Q. Did she tell you the details? A. Yes.Q. Did she tell you there was nothing on paper at that stage? A. Yes.131
Q. Did she tell you that the defence correspondent, Mr. Chapman Pincher,was also making enquiries? A. Yes.Q. And did you check with the news room that there was nothing on paper and there was no question of publication that weekend? A. Yes, I did all that.Q. Did you then telephone Colonel Lohan again and tell him that? A. Yes. I told him there was no question at any rate of the story being published thatweekend, and that therefore in my view anyway Monday would be early enough for us to talk.Q. Did you then report the substance of your conversation with Colonel Lohanto Mr. Brittenden, the editor? A. I did, immediately Colonel Lohan had left.Q. And also make sure the news room were not going to publish? A. Yes.Q. Now come to Monday, 20th February. Did Colonel Lohan come to youroffice about three o&apos;clock in the afternoon? A. Yes.Q. Had you made an appointment, or had somebody else? A. Colonel Lohanhad made the appointment with Mr. Macpherson, our defence correspondent.Q. Was Mr. Macpherson there when Colonel Lohan first arrived? A. No, hearrived perhaps two minutes after Colonel Lohan arrived in my office.Q. Who else was in your room during the Colonel Lohan conversation? A.The assistant managing editor, Mr. Spence, and so was my secretary.Q. Now will you tell the committee what Colonel Lohan told you and Mr.Macpherson about this matter? A. He said once again that he knew that we hadbeen making these enquiries; he agreed quite early in the conversation that our information that cables of all kinds were being checked was true. He said thatthis was a method of checking spies or potential spies which had been going on for some years, he said; and he said that this method of checking had yieldedsome worth while results, that it would be prejudicial to the continuance of these results if we were to publish a story now, and in general presented to me a request that we should hold our hand on this particular story. Macpherson asked whether in fact the checking which was going on was involved in a specific operation,possibly directed towards a particular person or people, and Colonel Lohan said&quot; Well, there are always specific operations going on &quot;. And Macpherson, I thinkfeeling this was not quite the answer he wanted, said &quot; But can you tell uswhether there is a particular operation going on now, the results of which we might be likely to hear soon?&quot; Colonel Lohan said that certainly there was aparticular operation going on, he would not want to be precise about the word&quot; soon &quot;, if what was meant was whether there was something going on of whichwe would hear a result in your lifetime talking to Macpherson well then, thiswould be so. And that question was left at that point.Q. Was anything said or done about &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Yes. Colonel Lohan ata stage in the conversation did say &quot;There are as a matter of fact a couple of&apos; D &apos; notices &quot; which he half drew out of his pocket-which could be said to affect this particular story &quot;. But he put the &apos; D &apos; notices back and said &quot; However,this conversation is not on the basis of &apos; D&apos; notices ; this is on the basis that Iam making an approach to you in this manner &quot;. And as far as I recollectthere was no further reference to &apos; D &apos; notices at all in that conversation.Q. Did he say anything to you about the authority under which this scrutinywas carried out? A. Yes, I think either I or Macpherson did ask whether thiswas a normal procedure, and he said it was authorised under warrant under theOfficial Secrets Act. He said that the warrant could be applied for and its lengthof operation was variable.Q. Were you as managing editor in a position to make a commitment one way or the other as to whether the story would be published? A. No, certainly not.Q. Did you, however, tell Colonel Lohan what your view was personally and what you would do? A. Yes. Towards the end of the conversation I said as faras I was concerned I felt personally that there was a case here for non-publication.&quot; But&quot;, I said, &quot; naturally you will appreciate a decision of that kind rests withthe editor, and naturally as soon as you have gone I shall be talking to the editorabout it, and I will leave him to make up his mind &quot;.
Q. Did he say anything about any other newspapers interest or attitude, andif so did he name any person or any paper? A. He did in fact mention he hadtalked with Mr. Chapman Pincher. I would not be able to quote the specific wordscoming from his mouth, but certainly he left me with a very clear impression I was in no doubt at all that I was to infer that as far as Mr. Chapman Pincherwas concerned the story was not going to be published, but he did not specificallysay that to me this was a very clear impression which was gained at the conversation.Q. Have you now told the committee everything material that you rememberabout this conversation? A. Yes, I believe that I have.Q. Having finished, as it were, with Colonel Lohan, did you go straight to the editor to see him? A. I did.Q. Did you report to him in general terms the gist of what Colonel Lohanhad told you? A. Yes, I certainly did.Q. Did the editor then ask you a question, and if so what was it? A. Yes. the editor asked me whether Colonel Lohan had referred to a specific operation going on at that time, and naturally I said Macpherson had asked that question, andI told him the answer which I have already given to the committee.Q. Did you and the editor then discuss the principle involved in this kind of approach by Colonel Lohan, and if so in what terms? A. We did discuss it.There was some conversation between us on the question of whether this approachhad the equivalent weight of a &apos; D &apos; notice, and in the course of that conversationI think we both agreed that in such a system as we have of a voluntary systemof trust and confidence we could neither of us I had better not speak for the editor but I said I could see no difference in principle between a request put inthis manner by the secretary of the &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee and a &apos; D &apos; noticeitself; it did not seem to me to alter the principle of the thing at all.Q. Did the editor then make a decision? A. Yes, the editor decided at that moment that we would not publish the story.Q. Did you then pass on the message to the news desk? A. I did, yes.Q. Did you also report I take it, by telephone the editor&apos;s decision to colonel Lohan? A. Yes, he had asked me to let him know what the editordecided, and I did that.Q. Will you come forward now to sometime about 10.30 or eleven o&apos;clock onthe Monday night, the 20th: did you receive a telephone call from Mr.Beverley, the night editor of the Daily Mail! A. Yes, I did.Q. What did he tell you?-A. He told me that Colonel Lohan had telephonedthe office and had said that he had learned that this particular story was appear-ing in the Scottish Daily Express. The night news editor at that time was not Ithink completely in the picture ; I told him quickly of the conversations I had had with Colonel Lohan and with the editor; I then cut the conversation rathershort and said: &quot; In the light of this, clearly the editor must be told straightaway of what is going on in the Scottish Daily Express &quot;. I got from the nightnews editor the editor&apos;s telephone number for that evening, and telephoned him and told him what the night news editor had told me.Mr. Hirst: Mr. Matthewman, we know that the story in fact appeared in thethird and subsequent editions of the Daily Mail for that night. I do not knowwhether the committee have got them, or, if they have not, whether they wouldlike them, but here they are.Chairman: Perhaps we had better have copies in among our documents.Mr. Hirst: You formally produce those, Mr. Matthewman? A. Yes. (Papershanded to the committee.)Q. Finally so far as your evidence is concerned, were you the author of a littlebracketed paragraph on page 5 of the Daily Mail the following day, reporting the Prime Ministers parliamentary statement concerning the publication of the daily Express? A. Yes, I was.133
Q. May I hand that in? (Paper for Wednesday, 22nd, passed to the commit-tee.) The original story is the front page article on the 21st, the parliamentaryreport is on page 5 on the 22nd, under the heading: &quot; Wilson and the caseof the vetted cables &quot;. I will just read, so that we see it in context, the first four paragraphs of the article:&quot; Mr. Harold Wilson yesterday criticised a newspaper for publishing a&apos; sensationalised and inaccurate story&apos; about checks by security officials on private cables sent abroad.The Prime Minister told the House that the confidence and trust whichwere the basis of warnings to newspapers (&apos; D &apos; notices) that publication ofa particular item would be against the public interest on security groundshad been called into question by the newspapers action.&quot;Now we come to your little bit, do we not? A. Yes, indeed.Q. Which reads:&quot; Information about the security checks being made was in the possessionof the Daily Mail last week. It was represented to the Daily Mail onbehalf of the security services that publication of this story at this particulartime would be undesirable. Therefore, the newspaper decided not to publish.Early editions of yesterday&apos;s Daily Express carried the story. The daily mail decided that because of this, no security grounds remained and pub-lished its own story in its later editions.&quot;Then you go on reporting Mr. Wilson&apos;s statement? A. Yes.Mr. Hirst: I do not think I need read that. That, my lord, is I think every-thing about which this witness can help the committee.Cross-Examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. Mr. Matthewman, on Friday that was the first conversation, was it not,and there was no mention by Colonel Lohan of &apos; D&apos; notice at all, was there?-A. No, not at all.Q. He told us that he thought he had had a conversation with you on Sunday I may be wrong about that did you have any conversation with him on sunday?-No.Q. He agreed to meet you on the Monday, to come to you on the Monday?-A. That is right.Q. And duly came on the Monday. After he had gone, when you had this discussion with Mr. Brittenden, the editor, you discussed together whether in these circumstances this was the same as a &apos; D &apos; notice or not? A. Yes.Q. Or editor&apos;s discretion, as it were, is that what it was,? A. No, what wewere concerned about was whether an approach of this kind had the sameweight, the same effect as a written &apos; D&apos; notice, and that is really what we werediscussing between ourselves.Q. And this was a matter of discussion, talking it out among yourselves, you and Mr. Brittenden? A. Certainly.Q. Because no &apos; D &apos; notice had been applied ; on the other hand you had had this actual request from the secretary, had you not? A. Quite, this was the pointof the conversation.Q. It had been said, I understand, on that meeting when you and Mr.Macpherson saw Colonel Lohan, there was definite talk, some kind of talk abouta specific operation going on? A. That is right.Q. It would be right to say this played naturally an important part in anyadvice that you gave, if you were asked to give any advice, to the editor,about whether to publish or not? A. Oh yes, it was a vital part.Q. And you reported indeed two matters to the editor, did you not: as you have told the committee, you reported that Mr. Macpherson immediatelyraised this point, and what Colonel Lohan said?- A. Yes.
Q. Can you tell me this, just to fit in, Mr. Matthewman: when you weretelephoned at 10.30, what is the stage on that night about your going to press,your first edition? What stage are you at then? A. We are very close to goingto press at that stage.Q. And the first edition went without the story, is that right? A. That is right, yes.Q. And the second? A. Also without.Q. When did it first appear? A. It first appeared in the third edition.Q. Which is about what time? A. Around one o&apos;clock in the morning.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Thank you.Chairman: Would you just tell me one or two things, Mr. Matthewman:I am not quite sure of your function as managing editor, does it involve you inany detailed knowledge of &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Not detailed knowledge, my lord.Q. Primarily the editor is concerned to know what they are? A. Certainlythe editor, I would say primarily the defence correspondent.Q. I am not so sure, but never mind. At any rate, I suppose the editor&apos;s.office keeps a file of the current &apos; D&apos; notices?-A. They are in fact kept lockedin the news room.Q. Then when Colonel Lohan came to see you on the afternoon of Monday,the 20th, he apparently had two &apos; D &apos; notices with him, and made reference tothem? A. That is right, my lord.Q. Did it get as close, between you and him, as Colonel Lohan actuallyreading any bit of them out to you or referring you to them? A. No, my lord,not at all, they were not even opened.Q. So it really was not present to your mind one way or the other as towhat particular wording was used in those &apos; D&apos; notices which he said had reference? A. No, my lord, in fact the reverse, because he said he was not making a point of those &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. The only other thing I wanted to ask you was this: you and the editor,when you came to talk the matter over as to what you should do after colonel lohan had left, you put the issue to yourselves: &quot; Ought we to treat this request from the Press and Broadcasting Committee&apos;s secretary as beingequivalent to the receipt of a &apos; D &apos; notice directly on the point? &quot;? A. That is right, my lord.Q. Have you ever had an approach of that kind, which appeared to be out-side the range of &apos; D &apos; notices themselves but was yet made on the samegrounds? A. I have not personally had one.Q. I do not know how far or in what directions your experience has gone, but you have not come across this kind of approach? A. I have heard of theseapproaches, I have not personally had one.Q. I should have thought the difference was that you could be sure that a&apos; D&apos; notice issued by the Press and Broadcasting Committee, if observed, went to all newspapers, including your competitors, but did a personal appeal to you,one paper, necessarily have the same result? A. Our view, my lord, was that itwould have the same result as far as we were concerned.Q. Because he did mention that the Express was also being approached? A.Yes, he did. Our concern on this point, if I have not perhaps made it entirelyclear, was because we had not been so to speak cited a &apos; D &apos; notice as a reasonfor us not publishing. What we had got was an approach by the secretary of the&apos; D &apos; notice Committee. Now I have heard although as I have said I havenot personally dealt with them I have heard of similar approaches, and, failinga &apos; D&apos; notice having been cited to us, the editor&apos;s concern and mine was whether in fact we should be viewing the approach which had been made in the samelight as we would have done had we been served with a &apos; D&apos; notice, and we came to the conclusion that in this voluntary system, which is, as has been repeated so often, a matter of trust and confidence, we came to the conclusionthat we should respect an approach of that kind, we should treat an approach of that kind in the same way as we would treat a &apos; D &apos; notice.
Q, As if it had the same force and authority as a &apos; D &apos; notice?--A. Yes.Q. But I suppose you would make an enquiry: &quot; If we observe this, what aboutother people?&quot;? A. No. For all cases of this kind this must in my view, withrespect, be a matter of an individual editor&apos;s decision. I do not think at thetime he is making that decision he can be influenced by what another newspapermay be about to do. Naturally, if subsequently another newspaper does in factremove what causes he may have had for not publishing, he would then clearlywant to think again.Q. That was what I gather happened in your case, was it not? A. It was indeed.Q. Because when the story did come out you felt you could not observe therequest? A. It seemed that the reasons for which we had withheld the story that was, that we had believed there to be good security reasons for notpublishing those security reasons could no longer exist when the tiling wasbeing turned out by the Express at great speed.Mr. Shinwell: I am not quite clear, Mr. Matthewman, why Colonel Lohanapproached you instead of going direct to the editor, who has the sole discretion as regards publication? Why did he approach you? A. I think the answer tothat is that as managing editor my principal functions are administrative, and inmany problems which will eventually reach the editor for his decision theearly steps in getting the necessary information are taken by me, and I thinkColonel Lohan knew that.Q. But can you recall any similar case where you were approached, whereit was not so much a matter of the &apos; D&apos; notice or the violation of the &apos; D &apos;notice, but rather a matter of the secretary of this Broadcasting Committee speak-ing to you in his capacity as secretary? A. I remember at least one otheroccasion when he telephoned me, yes ; I cannot recollect on what particularsubject. But I think it is probably fair to say that Colonel Lohan knows perfectly well what my particular functions are.Q. There was no actual discussion about the &apos; D &apos; notices, when he came tosee you, although he took them out of his pocket and put them back? A. No.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Just to get a word clear, because I am not certain what you said originally: in your proof you say he said there were two &apos; D &apos; notices whichcould be said to cover the particular circumstances, and he had them in hispocket and half took them out and put them back, then he said he was notrelying on them on this occasion? A. I would like to say that that is in fact the gist of what he said. I could not quote his exact words, because obviouslyat that time there was no particular reason why I should be taking notes, and I did not take them. But that is the sense of what he was saying. He actuallywent through the physical motions of taking them out and putting them back,and he said: &quot;This is not what we are discussing at the moment&quot;.Q. It was going to be discussed on the basis of a personal approach? A. Yes.Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Matthewman.(The witness withdrew)Mr. C. A. Macpherson called examined by Mr. HirstQ. Mr. Macpherson, your full name is Charles Angus Macpherson? A. Yes.Q. Are you the defence correspondent of the Daily Mail? A. Yes.Q. Would you just answer this yes or no: did you begin enquiries on the cable vetting story on Wednesday, 15th February, as a result of information received on the previous night? A. Yes.
Q. Did a Miss Celia Hadden collaborate with you? A. Yes.   6Q. Had you any story on paper on the Friday? -A. No.Q. Whether or not there had been any approach from Colonel Lohan, whatwould you have done of your own volition about your story before submittingit for publication?-A. As soon as I was certain that there was a story and had sufficient facts to write it, I would have consulted Colonel Lohan to see whether in fact there was a security objection to publishing it.Q. Why? A. Well, two reasons: in the first place this would be a storyobviously to do with the methods and activities of the security services, whichis automatically covered by a general &apos; D&apos; notice; and secondly, anything to do with the security services by precedent one does discuss with the secretary of the&apos; D &apos; Notice Committee.Q. Just answer this yes or no: did you on the Friday know that Mr. chapman pincher was also on the trail? A. Yes.Q. Did you get a message on the Friday afternoon this is the 17th February from Mr. Matthewman&apos;s office? A. Yes.Q. Tell us what it was, please.- A. It was that Colonel Lohan had been intouch with Mr. Matthewman&apos;s office saying that he knew that the Daily Mailwere enquiring into this story, and had asked us to hold up publication until theyhad the opportunity to discuss it with us.Q. Did you yourself then telephone Colonel Lohan at Charing, in Kent, that evening? A. Yes.Q. At what time, roughly? A. About 6.30.Q. What did he say to you? A. I asked him, to start with, I simply said: &quot; I gather you have been in touch with us already about this?&quot; and he said &quot;Yes &quot;,and I said: &quot; I was going to ring you, but anyway, what is the security situation on this story?&quot;, and he said: &quot;Well, it is a very serious security matter indeed,it goes far beyond &apos; D &apos; notices. I cannot say anything further over the phone,but I have already asked your managing editor and I would ask you to do nothing about publication until we have conversed&quot;. And he said he had arranged to come in and see Mr. Matthewman at three o&apos;clock on the Monday,and I said I would be there too in fact I think we made the appointment during that conversation.Q. Did you mention Lawson&apos;s name, or did anybody mention Lawson&apos;s name?-A. No.Q. Was anything said anonymously by Colonel Lohan about your source when I say &quot; anonymously &quot; I mean without mentioning names?-A. He said hethought that if we had a source, a particular source, he was getting into fairlydeep water and should be warned. He asked in fact-^-he did not ask me forthe name, he said: &quot; Of course you can&apos;t tell me the name, but if you can get a warning to him it would be in his own interests &quot;, and after discussionwith the editor we agreed that we would convey to the man who had talked tous that the head of the Services Press and Broadcasting Committee would appreciate a phone call from him, and we agreed to go that far. I believethat was done.Q. Did you finally make a time of appointment on the following Monday withhim A. Yes, three o&apos;clock.Q. Where did you arrange to meet him? A. I said I would see him down inthe lobby at Northcliffe House.Q. Will you come forward now to Monday, the 20th: did you in fact meet him in the hall? A. No, I was a few minutes late and he had already gone up to Mr. Matthewman&apos;s office.Q. So when you first saw him that was in Mr. Matthewman&apos;s office? A. Yes.Q. You have sat in during the last quarter of an hour when Mr. Matthewmanwas giving his account of that conversation? A. Yes.Q. Subject I think to one point which you must explain, do you confirm that account? A. Yes.
Q. There is one thing I think you do not remember, which you ought to speak about. A. I do not remember what Mr. Matthewman does, this reachingfor two &apos; D &apos; notices in his breast-pocket. I do remember him saying: &quot; I am not relying on the &apos; D &apos; notices &quot; in this context, and of course he had already said to me on the telephone on the Friday night: &quot; This is not a &apos; D &apos; noticematter, it goes far beyond it &quot;.Chairman: They are not quite the same things. Did he both say &quot; It is nota &apos; D &apos; notice matter &quot; and &quot; It is far beyond it&quot;? Or did he say &quot; This is some-thing that is far beyond &apos; D &apos; notices &quot;?-A. On the Friday night he said that,on the Monday he said: &quot; I am not relying on &apos; D &apos; notices &quot;.Q. But on the Friday night he said both &quot; This is a very serious securitymatter &quot; and &quot; It goes far beyond &apos; D &apos; notices &quot;? A. Yes.Mr. Hirst: What was your view do not worry about anybody else&apos;s whatwas your view at the end of Colonel Lohan&apos;s conversation on the Monday? A.My view was that we ought not to publish the story.Q. Why? A. Because I felt that this was an activity of the security servicesthat they were entitled to keep to themselves, and in this of course I was particularly influenced by the fact of the confirmation that there was a specificexercise going on at that time, which might come to an end within a measurableperiod, that there was in fact something they were after at that particularmoment which might be prejudiced by publication at this time.Q. We now come forward to much later that night. Did you, sometimeabout eleven o&apos;clock or 11.30, get a telephone message at home from the nighteditor, Mr. Beverley?-A. Yes.Q. Was a story which he had written read over to you, and did you confirmit?-A. Yes.Q. That is the story, is it not, which eventually appeared in the third editionand thereafter of the Daily Mail the next day? A. Yes.Q. Were you told that Colonel Lohan had asked for something? A. I was told that Colonel Lohan had passed this with the exception of one phrase, . . .and he had asked that this should come out, which had been done, and apartfrom that he had O-kayed the story, and it accorded with the information had too.Mr. Hirst: Thank you.Sir Peter Rawlinson: No questions.Chairman: Help me out on this, will you, Mr. Macpherson: you do have apretty good working knowledge of the wording of &apos; D &apos; notices, do you not?- A. Yes, sir.Q. One of April 1956 has been referred to. A. Yes.Q. I just want to see what you, with your experience of them, make of these words: &quot; Will you please in the national interest make no reference to thefollowing . . . &quot;, and the first heading is &quot; Secret intelligence or counter intelli-gence methods and activities in or outside the United Kingdom&quot;. Did theactivities which you were getting on to, in the story you were studying, appearto you to be secret intelligence methods or activities? A. Yes, sir, they did.Q. I have a little difficulty in seeing what else they could have been. A. IfI could add on that, sir, this would mean in my mind that it was thereforesomething that one would automatically discuss with the secretary, with colonel lohan, and this would be the baseline you would start from, that before youprint anything you must discuss this with him, and possibly argue the point withhim.Q. That is what you started to do on the Friday, as I understand? A. I waspre-empted by Colonel Lohan, of course, who called us, but I would have calledhim probably that evening in any case. He meanwhile called us.Q. The other thing I am only seeing what your attitude was is that colonel lohan stated to you and Mr. Matthewman on the Monday that there was a specific operation going on? A. Yes.Q. Which could be prejudiced of course by publication? A. Yes.
Q. If you thought the general business was well within this wording whichI have read out to you from the April 1956 letter, did it matter from the pointof view of Defence Notices whether there was a particular detective operation,or whatever it was, going on, or not? A. I think this fact clinched it. If ithad not been, if it had been agreed this was just a general sampling operation,then one would have had to consider whether there was any possibility of this being misused, whether in fact it was a thing which ought to be revealed, ingeneral terms, and I think the editor of a newspaper, after advice, always hasthis overriding right to say: &quot; Despite the advice from the security authorities,we consider this is something which the public should know is going on &quot;. Thefact that a specific operation of uncertain date, but one you would hope tosee the end of fairly soon, was going on, was certainly a crucial factor in my mind.Q. Yes, a clincher; but if I understand it and I want you to say if you agree with this or not although you think it would have been within the wording of a particular &apos; D &apos; notice, it would have been a question whether there were other public interests so important that the editor might decide to print just the same, is that it? A. Exactly, my lord, yes.Mr. Shinwell: You appear not to have been surprised that no reference wasmade to the &apos; D&apos; notice; why was that? A. Because I had assumed that thiswas within the general terms of the 1956 &apos; D&apos; notice, being an activity of thesecurity services in this country.Q. Was that simply because Colonel Lohan had come to you and spoken toyou about it? A. No, I think it was because I have known this &apos; D&apos; notice fora very long time, I knew the terms of this, and I assumed, as I would in anystory of this kind, that it was a matter which had to be referred to the &apos; D &apos;Notice Committee or its secretary.Q. Some reference has been made to the statement he made to you on Friday,and judging by the language he used he would seem to have taken a more seriousview on Friday than on Monday ; on Monday he did not refer so much to the&apos;D&apos; notice, but on Friday it was rather different, was it not?-A. I thinkpossibly when he met us on Monday he was relying on the fact that he had spoken to both of us on the Friday, and to me at any rate he had said: &quot; Thisis a matter going far beyond &apos; D &apos; notices, this is a serious security matter &quot;.Q. He had said he was not relying on the &apos;D,&apos; notice, on Monday? A. Oh,he did, yes.Q. And on Friday he did rely on the &apos; D &apos; notice? A. On Friday he said:&quot; This goes far beyond &apos; D &apos; notices &quot;.Q. Have you been approached at all by somebody named Lawson, givingyou information about this matter? A. I have not, no, sir.Q. Do you know about him? A. I know of him through hearsay, yes.Q. He has never approached you in any sense? A. I have never met him.Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Macpherson.(The witness withdrew)Mr. A. Brittenden called examined by Mr. HirstQ. Mr. Brittenden, is your full name Arthur Brittenden? A. It is.Q. Are you the editor of the Daily Mail&apos;? A. Yes.Q. Were you aware before Friday, 17th February, that Mr. Angus Macpherson,who has just given evidence, was investigating with Miss Celia Haddeninformation concerning cable vetting? A. No, it was not until the 17th thatI became aware of it.Q. On the same day were you told by Mr. Matthewman of a message he hadreceived by telephone from Colonel Lohan? A. Yes, I was.
Q. Just tell the committee in substance what Mr. Matthewman told you. A.He told me Colonel Lohan had telephoned him about enquiries he understood the Daily Mail were making into the vetting of cables, that Colonel Lohansaid that publication of this story would be wrong and against the national interest on grounds of security. Mr. Matthewman, not knowing the extent of the enquiries, then checked and found out that our enquiries were still far from complete, and it was clear that we would need to work on them for at leastanother day or so before we would then arrange for publication. On these grounds, and also because Colonel Lohan was at that time down in the country,we agreed that we would take no further action on the story until Colonel Lohancould talk to us on Monday.Q. I think you knew that an appointment had been made for the Monday? A.That is right, yes.Q. Will you come forward now to the Monday, 20th February, when I think,after his interview with Colonel Lohan. Mr. Matthewman came to your officeto report to you? A. That is right, yes.Q. What was the substance of what Mr. Matthewman told you at the outset of that conversation? A. What he said again was to repeat in general termswhat we had been told on Friday, that Colonel Lohan was saying that itwould be against the national interest to print this story. At this point I think said to Mr. Matthewman that I still thought that the fact that cables werebeing vetted in this way was a disturbing state of affairs, and I was not happyabout it. It was then in this conversation, at this point, that I said: &quot; Did Lohanin his arguments make any point about a specific operation going on at themoment? Would we, if we published, be interfering with anything they are doing at this particular time?&quot; Matthewman said that indeed that question was put to Colonel Lohan by Angus Macpherson, and that in reply Lohanhad said: &quot; Yes, there is an operation going on at this time &quot;. This, for me,was the decisive factor, because it seemed to me untenable that we wouldprint a story if we had been assured by Colonel Lohan that in doing this we would interfere with something which the security authorities were doingat that very time.Q. Did you have a discussion with Mr. Matthewman as to the principle ofthis kind of approach from Colonel Lohan? A. Yes, I did, and we agreed,in the terms which I think Mr. Matthewman himself has already describedthis afternoon, that for Colonel Lohan himse],f personally to make these representations, and in as forceful a fashion as he had done, must be tantamount to the authority of a &apos; D &apos; notice.Q. You therefore gave instructions not to publish? A.&apos;That enquiries wouldnot go on and that the story would not be published.Q. In view of questions which have been put to Mr. Macpherson, I thinkperhaps I should just ask you about this, because although it is not on yourproof I think you have thought about it: you have said the current operation was the decisive factor for you? A. Yes.Q. Had you at that stage considered the matter against any specific &apos; D&apos;notice? A. No, to enquire particularly into a &apos;D &apos; notice had not occurred.Q. What would your procedure have been, do you think, had the specificoperation factor not entered into it? A. If the specific operation had not been mentioned, I am quite sure that we would then have had further discussion on the &apos; D&apos; notices, and had we done that, and now seeing the notices, I am quite confident that I would still have taken the same decision, that we shouldnot publish.Q. Did you dine out in regent&apos;s  Park on that evening?-A. I did, yes.Q. Did you at some time, 10 o&apos;clock or 10.30 do not worry about the exact time get a telephone call from Mr. Matthewman? A. Yes, I did.Q. Telling you what? A. This was to say that he had a telephone call tohim from the Daily Mail office to say that they in turn had heard form colonel Lohan that the first edition of the Scottish Daily Express was printingthe story which we had agreed that day not to publish.
Q. Did you then ring the news desk to say you yourself would go back to your office? A. That is right, yes.Q. Before actually getting out of the flat, did you receive a further telephonecall? A. I did. This was literally within a matter of a moment or two,because I had simply gone out and started to put my coat on when the phonerang again. This was a call from Beverley, the night news editor of the daily mail, who said he had now had a further call from Colonel Lohan to saythere was no need for us to worry, that he, Colonel Lohan, had been in touchwith the Daily Express, that they had said it was a mistake that this storywas running in their Scottish edition, and Colonel Lohan said that the Expresswere now pulling out all stops -I remember this phrase being used pullingout all stops to ensure that it did not go on appearing. I then said toBeverley: &quot; Well, I will still come back to the office in any case &quot;, which I did.Q. Did you go back to the office, and as soon as you got back to theoffice were you handed this first edition of the London Daily Express? A.Yes, I was.Q. On which the story was appearing on the front page? A. Yes.Q. At about the same time did Colonel Lohan come on to you on the telephone? A. Yes, the telephone rang almost as I was handed this paper,and I was told it was Colonel Lohan, and I then went into my own roomto take this call.Q. I do not think it is important, but I think he expected to get onto Beverley and not to you? A. I think probably there was some smallconfusion on the switchboard.Q. Will you tell the committee what you remember about the course ofthe conversation? A. The conversation started almost as it were on anoddly social note, because Colonel Lohan referred to the fact that we hadnot met, that I had recently taken up the editorship and that he hoped itmay not be long before we had a chance to meet. He then went on to say:&quot; I am sorry you have had all this anguish tonight, but it is all right now &quot;. Iwas very surprised by this, obviously, because I had this copy of the daily express in front of me by this time, and I said&apos;to him: &quot;I do not know what you mean when you say everything&apos;s all right&quot;, and he said: &quot; Well,the Express have agreed to take it out, they are not printing it&quot;. And I said that I had got the first edition of the Daily Express in front of me,and of course the story was there. I think he said either: &quot; Are youserious?&quot; or &quot;Are you joking?&quot;, but he said something which indicated verygreat surprise, and I said: &quot; Of course I am not joking, 111 read it to you &quot;,and, I then read him the headlines and I started to read the first line ortwo of the story, and at this point he said: &quot; My god, this is awful, 111have to ring off, I&apos;ve got people that I must tell about this &quot; and that was it, he had gone.Q. Meanwhile was Beverley busy putting together the story? A. Yes,because at the point that I had seen the Daily Express, and realised thatat least at that stage they were still printing the story, I did say to Beverleythat protectively we should now start to get our story on to paper thiswas not to say to publish it, but at least to have the story typed on paper.Q. And I. imagine there were a great many telephone calls going on,but did Beverley tell you Colonel Lohan had telephoned again? -A. Yes,he did.Q. What did he say? A. I said that now Colonel Lohan had indicated that the Express were continuing to publish, therefore I felt there was nopurpose in our carrying on with the undertaking which we had givenearlier in the day, and I think it was at this point that Beverley probablytold me that Colonel Lohan had agreed that when our story was preparedhe would as it were discuss it with us to make sure that there was still no-objection from the security services.
Q. Then did Beverley report yet again his &quot; reading over &quot; conversation with colonel Lohan later? A. That is right, he said he had read the story to Colonel ^&quot;&quot;ALohan. and that Colonel Lohan had asked for one small passage to be taken out . . . and that this we had done.Q. - ...Q. On the following day did you arrange for Mr. Matthewman to inserthis bracket in the parliamentary report, in the account of the Prime Minister^statement, so that the Daily Mail&apos;s position could be made clear to the readers ? A. This was an explanation which I felt we had to give particularly to readersin the early edition areas, because obviously these readers had of course seennothing in the Daily Mail, and were now faced with this parliamentary statement.Cross-examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. Mr. Brittenden, you said when you discussed this with Mr. Matthewmanon the Monday you said to Mr. Matthewman that the fact that the cables werebeing vetted was in your view a disturbing state of affairs, and you were nothappy about it? A. Yes.Q. That was your reaction as an editor, and you had to take that into account and you also had to take into account the other matters that had been reported?-A. That is right.Q. When you told the committee that it really was the specific operation which had been mentioned which really led to your decision . . . A. Thiswas the decisive factor, yes.Q. Then you were asked a hypothetical question by Mr. Hirst about removingthat specific operation, still having regard to the &apos; D &apos; notices, what your decisions would be? A. Yes.Q. While I appreciate what you say, you would agree, would you not, that other newspapers, The Times and the Mirror, the Telegraph and the Observer,have all expressed a different view? A. Yes.Q. In other words it is a matter which different editors have different iews about? A. It is an editor&apos;s interpretation of the decision that he must make.Sir Peter Rawlinson: And he has got to balance what is obviously a matterof public disturbance against the other matter?Chairman: I am not quite clear, Sir Peter, what you are putting. It is one thing to say that, when the letter of April, 1956 is read, the story is not coveredby the wording of it; it is another thing to say that it may be covered by the wording but there are public reasons which make it desirable to ignore it. I am not quite sure what The Times and the Telegraph and the Observer have contributed on this?Sir Peter Rawlinson: Are you not? I beg your pardon, my Lord, I thought this would obviously have been put before you.Chairman: If you are going to address us on it, that is all right, but I am not quite sure which point you are putting to Mr. Brittenden.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I am really putting the point, my Lord, that thequestion first of all whether a &apos; D &apos; notice applied at all was a matter of judgmentwhich the editor had to take. You would agree with that, Mr. Brittenden?-A. Yes.Q. Secondly, even if the &apos; D&apos; notice did not apply, leaving out the specificoperation, although there were some representations about security, an editorhas got to balance which he puts first? A. Yes, and again as long as this isa voluntary operation, quite clearly one editor might decide one way and one might decide another.Q. You see, The Times said specifically that the Daily Express disclosure onthe face of it was not a disclosure where the public interest clearly counselledsecrecy, and the Daily Express reasonably disputed that it fell under the&apos; D &apos; notices, that was the view of The Times! A. Yes.
Q. And the Telegraph expressed the view that the relevant &apos; d &apos; notices werenot breached? A. Yes.Q. Really when it came to your decision, the practical decision you were faced with on Monday afternoon, you had got this categoric view which you had been told about of a specific operation? A. Indeed. I was put in theposition that if I did publish this story I would quite deliberately be interfering with an operation that was then going on, and this would seem to me absolutelywrong.Mr. Shinwell: As editor of a responsible newspaper if a matter of this kind is brought to your notice, and you have some doubts about the matter, whetherrelated to &apos; D &apos; notices, or perhaps some other question you may have had,why do you come to a decision? Is it because you are concerned as editorof a responsible newspaper for security? A. Of course ; most certainly.Q. That is where your discretion applies? Of course. I would think it wasvery wrong for any newspaper to flout a responsible person&apos;s request which wasmade in this way and on very specific grounds.Q. When in addition Colonel Lohan, who is the Secretary of the Press and broadcasting Committee, makes representations to one of your associates, and eventually to yourself, that confirms your opinion that it is wrong to publish? A. It does, yes. After all we all know that this system depends on trust. you have to have faith. Colonel Lohan is the man appointed, and Colonel Lohanis the man who came and stated his case. If you cannot apply trust at thattime, it seems to me the system falls apart, and there is no system.Q. Exactly. In this statement reference is made to Colonel Lohan approachingyou when you came back to the office. You had dinner and went back to theoffice. A. Yes.Q. At what time did he approach you? You left regent&apos;s  Park at ten o&apos;clock.What time was that? A. I think the time of ten o&apos;clock may be slightly wronghere, because the time at which I arrived at my office, and I came back straightaway, must have been around eleven o&apos;clock, because that was the time atwhich I arrived in the office, almost at the same time as the Daily Express, thatwould be about eleven o&apos;clock.  .   .   .Q. Colonel Lohan expressed regret that you had been suffering anguishbecause of what had occurred, and you could not understand what he meant,and then he said, &quot; The Express have taken it out&quot;, obviously meaning the story. A. Yes.Q. You produced the first London edition. A. Which I had in front of meon my desk.Q. Were you not surprised when Colonel Lohan said that to you? A. I was.This is why I was surprised by the beginning of this conversation. It seemedto me quite extraordinary that he was starting a conversation at this time on a social note when I had this in front of me, but it became clear after a momentor two that he was not aware that that was being printed, or this was theimpression that he gave me, that he was not aware that that was being printed,and indeed he went on to say, &quot; Sorry about the anguish, but it is all right now.&quot;Q. You have no doubt that he was serious, that he was not aware that the express had published? A. No, he gave me the impression of a man who wasvery very surprised indeed that it was in the Express, and this was after I had readonly a very small part of it. He used these words, &quot; My God, this is awful, Ihave got people I must tell&quot;, and he rang off, and I do not think there was even a formal good-bye.Q. Eventually later on he agreed that if other newspapers had published itthere was no point in non-publication by the Daily Mail? A. Indeed.Re-examined by Mr. HirstQ. Mr. Brittenden, in relation to Mr. ShinwelTs last question about colonel lohan&apos;s surprise, you of course knew that he knew it had come out in theScottish edition of the Daily Express? A. Yes.
Q. Was the surprise relating to it occurring in the Express or in the Londonedition? A. I am sorry, in the London editions.Mr. Hirst: I beg Mr. ShinwelTs pardon, but I wanted to get that clear.Mr. Shinwell: Colonel Lohan was aware that it had already been in the Scottishedition? A. He had first advised us of this. He telephoned.Q. Did you know that it had been in the Scottish edition? A. Not untilColonel Lohan telephoned the Daily Mail office, and the Daily Mail office thengot in touch with me where I was dining.Q. While you were out dining? A. That is right. This must have been some time shortly after ten o&apos;clock.Q. When you heard that it appeared in the Scottish edition, what was yourreaction then, did you want to publish? A. I said I would come back to theoffice, and clearly this was in my mind, that this had changed the original situa-tion where we had withheld the story for obvious security reasons, but if the story was now being published this would mean one was faced with a new situation where security was blown.(The witness withdrew)Chairman: Have you any more witnesses, Mr. Hirst?Mr. Hirst: I have Mr. Beverley here. I do not think the Committee will want to hear him. He will only speak, if the Committee wish him to do so, of pastconversations with Colonel Lohan and the way he was told about the ScottishDaily Express. I have him here because I thought the Committee might wish tocover it.Chairman: I do not think there is any real difference as to what went on in thispart of the field.  I do not think we need him.Mr. Hirst: That is what I expected your lordship would say, but I had himhere in case.Chairman: I think we should now be saying good-bye to your party, unlessyou wish to say something?Mr. Hirst: I do not wish to say anything to your lordship.Chairman: Thank you all for coming.(The Daily Mail representatives withdrew)Sir Peter Rawlinson: I will now call straight away Mr. Chapman Pincher. Ihave a statement which we can put before you. I also will have three bundlesof the press matters which I was going to refer to, and which I will havebundled up and put before you this evening to add to your already voluminouscollection.Chairman: We have quite a lot of press cuttings. *Sir Peter Rawlinson: The ones of course I am interested in are, for instance,the leader in The Times when they give their view of it on 22nd February.Chairman: See what you can make of them. You may have to call thegentlemen who expressed them.   At any rate we&apos; will see.Mr. Chapman Pincher called examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. Mr. Chapman Pincher, you are the defence correspondent of the daily express? A. Yes.Q. For how many years have you been in that position? A. Twenty.Q. Was it at about 3 p.m. by appointment on Thursday, February 16th, thatyou met a Mr. Lawson at your office in the Daily Express? A. That is correct.Q. Did he tell you where he had worked? A. Yes, in two cable offices. he mentioned Commercial Cables and Western Union, and he said he had leftthem several months 
Q. Did he have a story to tell you, and what was it? A. Yes. The story he told me was that he said he was very perturbed and was I aware that all the cables from these cable offices were collected every morning by Ministry ofWorks van and were taken to a department, the Ministry of Defence, which hethought was in the old Admiralty building, and held there for 48 hours, and thatmade them available for scrutiny.Q. Did he say what his enquiries had shown about this being routine practice? A. Yes. He said as far as he was aware, because he had been rather dismayedby it when working at these cable offices, that he had made enquiries and he found it had certainly gone on for two years.Q. Did he say anything about Post Office cables? A. He just said I asked him about the Post Office cables, because I reminded him Cable and Wirelesshad been nationalised and was part of the Post Office I said, &quot; Most of the cables would go through the Post Office service, what about that?&quot; and he said,&quot; As far as I am aware it also happens at the Post Office &quot; but he was not sure.Q. Did you say anything to him about if a person was under suspicion as aspy what the position should be? A. At first I did not think much of his infor-mation, because I thought it was known that if there was a case in practice andanybody was suspected, that this would be normal practice in any country,however democratic, and I said this to him.Q. Were you at the time yourself aware that this practice went on aboutcollection of telegrams? A. That was entirely news to me. If it were aroutine matter I was interested, because this was news, and if it were a specific operation it would not have concerned me because I would think it isnormal practice.Q. Had you been defence correspondent when the Telephone Tapping Inquiryhad been held in 1957? A. Yes, and several other mentions of it since.Q. And you have read the report of the Birkett Committee? A. Yes, I haveread everything that has been published, not recently, but I have read it all inthe course of my work.Q. What did you say to Mr. Lawson? A. I told him I was quite interestedin his story. He then volunteered the information that he had been to the daily Mail. I said, &quot; Why have you come to me? &quot; and he said, &quot; Well, theyhave made a bit of a mess of it.&quot; He said, &quot; They have gone round against myadvice photographing lorries loading these bags from Commercial Cables&quot;.I did not think it was a very good idea, and he said, &quot; Neither did I, and I amfed up with them, and that is why I have come to you, and they have donewhat I have asked them to do and that would make difficulties &quot;.Q. Did he talk about a London University magazine? A. Yes. He said he was a student at the university and could only be contacted through theuniversity, and he said the magazine called the Sennet was interested in the story,and he was acting as a freelance for them, and they might be doing somethingon it, particularly about photographing the vans.Q. A week after this did in fact the Sennet produce this? A. Yes.Chairman: We have seen copies.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Did you ask Mr. Lawson about his personal position? A. Yes, I did, because it struck me as possible if you worked in a cable officeyou might be under the Official Secrets Acts, even in an ordinary cable office,and he said he had never ever signed any statement other than a statement that hewould not reveal the specific contents of cables.Q. And did he tell you anything about his motives? A. I asked him what hispurpose was. I rather suspected that he was after money, but in fact he wasnot, and he has never asked for money. I gather that he seemed a chap witha bit of a chip on his shoulder, but the main thing that had touched him offwas that he had seen something on television. This fellow was masked, you couldnot see his face, and he was involved in a situation in which letters to and froma certain organisation were collected by the Post Office, and he was the collector.
Q. A commercial organisation? A. It was a private organisation, not a Gov-ernment organisation, a private organisation of some kind, and these letters -I donot know the details these letters were being collected for vetting by the PostOffice security authorities. This had come out, and it was news, and he came to me and said, &quot; My God, if this is news what about this much bigger intrusioninto privacy of all the cables being available for scrutiny?&quot;Q. Did he mention anything about commerce? A. Yes. He did volunteer theidea that he thought it was very bad that the cables sent out particularly by private firms to overseas businesses might be given publicity, and I think hespecifically mentioned the Board of Trade as a possibility. He had no evidencethat it did happen, but as they were available this could happen.Q. How long was he with you for? A. I suppose about half to three quarters of an hour.Q. Did you then ring Wing Commander Harris whom we saw this afternoon? A. Yes. As soon as he left the office I decided I would make a check tosee whether it was true, because we had to have verification of it. I rang wing commander Harris and asked him whether it was true that cables were takento the Ministry of Defence.Q. Did he give you the answer that we have heard about this afternoon? A.Yes, I agree entirely with his evidence.Q. Then did you ring Mr. 0&apos;Brien? A. Yes, I rang Mr. 0&apos;Brien, an old friend of mine, and I said, &quot; I had a chap in here with this story.&quot; I told him itwas about cables and vetting cables. I said, &quot; If it is true the G.P.O. must be involved because they are the biggest handlers of cables. I do not want towaste any time on it. If it is not true can you give me any guidance you cannot say it on the record but guidance to save me wasting my time? &quot; Herang back after taking advice and said, &quot; You would not be wasting your time.There is substance in the story &quot;. He then rang me back later on of his ownvolition, when I did not expect any call. He said, &quot; Look, I should tell you I havespoken to somebody else. They do not all go &quot; to whatever department it was,from the Post Office to another department, and he did not mention the nameof the department, &quot; only some go &quot;. I then tried to get him to develop it, totell me if they were first of all looked at in the Post Office security and then wenton somewhere else, but he was not drawn on that any further.Q. You had seen Mr. Lawson, you had spoken to Wing Commander Harris,spoken to Mr. 0&apos;Brien. Did you then next telephone Colonel Lohan? A. Yes,I considered that 0&apos;Brien&apos;s statement was considerable confirmation of the story,and I was prepared to go on with it, and then I telephoned Colonel Lohan.Q. Just tell us about Colonel Lohan. How long have you known him? A. Ihave known Colonel Lohan for about 15 years.Q. He described you as I think a personal friend? A. Yes, our wives are friends and we go to each others&apos; homes.Q. And he decribed you as getting on to him many times I think in the courseof perhaps a month? A. I should think on some matter concerning a matter that we either worked on or wanted to print. Many of them fall down and nevercome to anything.  Two or three times a week.Q. You telephoned him. What time approximately, and what did you say? A. I think about a quarter to five, and I said, &quot; Look, I have got hold of some information that cables are being collected from cable offices and sent round inbags to some security department or other, I think the Ministry of Defence, andare available for vetting. I have had some confirmation of it. If this is truewould it be covered by any existing &apos; D &apos; notice?&quot;.Q. What was the reply? A. He told me categorically that no &apos; D &apos; notice couldinterfere with the publication of such a story.Q. He said yesterday you were present when he gave evidence that the storyyou told him on the telephone, according to his recollection, was a story of the cables and telegrams from the Post Office? A. No, I think he said telegrams, butin fact the information that I had really discussed with Wing Commander Harris
was exactly the same information I discussed with Colonel Lohan, because the conversation was within a very short period of time, one after the other, andthe only information I had apart from Mr. 0&apos;Brien was that it was cables fromcable offices.Q. He gave you that answer. Was there anything more in the story that was actually published in the newspaper than what you had told Lohan on Thursdaywhen he said there were no &apos; D &apos; notices? A. No. I made further enquiries, butthe only additional information I got was confirmation, and the story, if you readit on the front page of the Daily Express, the one complained about, has infact really only one fact in it. That is that these cables are collected. Theother fact is that they were supposedly held for 48 hours and were availablefor scrutiny. That was given to Colonel Lohan on Thursday night on which he gave me his answer.Chairman: Before we leave this particular enquiry of yours, I think colonel lohan said that your wording started with the General Post Office you say thatis not right and ended with the Ministry of Defence in the sense that theywere the collecting and scrutinising agent. A. Yes.Q. Did you actually put it that way to him? A. I told him exactly what had happened. A man had come to my office and said that these cables were collected from cable offices and sent to what he believed was a branch of the Ministry ofDefence, and I even discussed it with him when he said it is the old Admiraltybuilding. I said &quot; I think it is not now because there has been reorganisation, itused to be a communications place.&quot; I rather think that he agreed, but Iwould not be certain.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Then what was the position on that evening of the 16th?You have told the Committee that you did not get any furher information.What did you think? Was there any ban or bar on you publishing that informa-tion that you had received? A. No. The drill which we always follow and everynewspaper as far as I know follows this and has been doing ever since the &apos; D &apos;notice system has been going is we are not the arbiters as to whether it appliesor not, but we ring up the Secretary it used to be Admiral Thomson and is nowColonel Lohan and he gives his decision, and if he gives a decision that is it. Ifhe has made the wrong decision that is his affair, but there is no further personone can go to or needs to go to. So that particular night if I had gone into the news editor or even the editor and said &quot; I had this story. I do not think weare going to get any more. We can run this and Colonel Lohan has cleared it by saying no &apos; D&apos; notices.&quot;  We could have run it that night.Q. Did you think at that time in view of your experience of &apos; D &apos; notices thatany &apos; D &apos; notice did apply? A. No, I did not. One &apos; D &apos; notice did refer to thismatter, but it was my view from our previous experience that they did not applyso I was not surprised when he said that they did not. :nChairman: It is not quite as straightforward as that, when the Secretary ofthe Press and Broadcasting Committee expresses the view that something is withina &apos; D &apos; notice. Argument then can take place on occasions. A. Yes, but if he says it is not then we feel free to publish.Q. I understand your approach, but he is not a complete arbiter in the sense thathe rules that this is within a &apos; D&apos; notice and you say &quot; Very well, we do not publish.&quot;- A. I quite agree. I am sorry if I gave the wrong impression. Whenhe gives a negative answer we always have felt free to publish, and the reasonfor this is the time factor. If we wanted to publish that night, there was quitepossibly some reason why we should, because this man had told me the Mail now had this story, we should have felt quite free to do so without making any furtherchecks vis-a-vis security. Perhaps I did not finish answering your questions about&apos; D&apos; notices, which I think is important as it has been raised. The 1956 &apos; D&apos;-notice refers to secret methods. On the fact of it one might think, as thisis done in secrecy, vetting cables, it counts as a secret method, but I have hadmany discussions with Admiral Thomson and Colonel Lohan, and it has alwaysbeen agreed that telephone tapping or the opening of letters even though it is donein secrecy does not count as a secret method. Admiral Thomson told me on many
occasions when I discussed the question ^ of whether we can talk abouttelephone tapping in the newspapers, he said that secret methods in the &apos; D &apos;notice refer really to methods which are still secret, such as in those dayselectronic devices which were not talked about and which are now, and colonel lohan pointed out to me in one of our conversations that as far as the examina-tion of cables is concerned it cannot be regarded as a secret method because itis described in full in the Official Secrets Act of 1920 where they point out thepower exists for doing this.Q. I think I will not interrupt with one or two questions I have on that, but i will ask you at the end. A. Surely.Sir Peter Rawlinson: You did not write it on 16th February. A. No.Q. And that was because you were involved in the Defence White Paper? A. Iwas covering the Defence White Paper on that day.Q. I think this is common ground. The telephone conversation on the Friday,the next day, 17th February. Colonel Lohan said there was not one. Was any-thing said between you and Colonel Lohan on the next day, Friday? A. colonel lohan is quite mistaken about this. What happened was that I was in the officeafter lunch on the Friday, which was the following day, and as far as I was concerned we were still free to print the story if we wished to do so. I ranghim at his office, purely to gossip about what he thought about the White Paper,just to get his views on it as a chap who knew about these things, and I was not going to write anything. His secretary reminded me she had told me on the telephone that he was not available because he was going to be working at home in the country on a job, and she said, &quot; You will be able to get him at 4.30.&quot; I said, &quot; It is only gossip, don&apos;t bother &quot;. He rang me. I said, &quot; I was trying toget you earlier &quot;, and he said, &quot; I am trying to get you now &quot;, and he then told me he would have to ask me in spite of what he said on Thursday not to printthat story.Q. What did you say when he said &quot; I have to ask you not to print the story &quot;.? A. I asked him why, and he then said and this is absolutely clear inmy mind-he said, &quot; It would cause a diplomatic furore.&quot; I said, &quot; Why is that? &quot;.He said, &quot;All the foreign embassies would immediately think that their cableswere being examined, and there would be a hell of a row, and we cannot have this.&quot; I said, &quot; This sounds feeble &quot;, and he said, &quot; It is not, and if necessary i will get the Foreign Secretary to explain it to you &quot;, and he mentioned Mr. GeorgeBrown by name.Q. What did he say then? A. He then said that this was the matter, thatthe diplomatic situation was a real one, that he was concerned about it, and thenfinally after we had been arguing about this diplomatic thing he said, &quot; Look,this is a security business, and I must ask you not to print.&quot;,, I said, &quot; I have no intention of writing anything today &quot;, and he said, &quot; I am prepared to come up and see you on Sunday, but it would be better to leave it until Monday &quot; and Iagreed because there seemed to be no urgency. He also told me he was quite sure, because I asked him, that the Mail would be leaving it until Monday.We arranged that I would come to his office, and he then said that he would havea security official there who if necessary would go over the matter with me.Q. On Saturday did you in fact dine with Mr. Eban, the Israeli ForeignMinister? A. Yes, and as a gambit of conversation then without giving thereasons I asked him if he would be concerned if he heard that cables from hisembassy to his office in Tel Aviv were being examined. He laughed and said,&quot; If we sent them and they were not in code, we would expect them to be examined. This is normal practice, we do it, and this is one reason they arein code and we are allowed to do so &quot;. So that made me realise right awaythat my suspicions about Colonel Lohan&apos;s reason for withholding the storywere justified that the diplomatic furore was something he had invented to getus over the week-end.Mr. Shinwell: I think you said something like this, that Colonel Lohan waspromising that he would meet you on Monday and that he was going to bring
someone from . . . A. I was going to meet him in his office, and he wouldhave -I do not know whether he used the words security official but he made it quite clear that there would be some official who would be there when I got tohis office on Monday to explain matters in greater detail to me, and I was toring him up on Monday morning and arrange a time to come to his office, whichis quite near Fleet Street.Q. You did not see any security official? A. No, a little later on I will explainwhat happened, but he never materialised.Chairman: I think perhaps that is a convenient point for us to adjourn.(The proceedings were adjourned until Wednesday, 15th March, 1967.)Minutes of a Meeting of the Committee held in theCabinet Office on Wednesday, 15th March, 1967, at 2.15 p.m.Present:Lord Radcliffe (Chairman)Mr. E. ShinwellMr. Selwyn LloydMr. D. J. Trevelyan (Secretary)The following gave evidence: At 2.15 p.m.     Mr. Chapman Pincher   Defence Correspondent \ n ., xrvr.r.^.3.30 p.m.     Mr. Derek Marks        Editor j-uany express the following attended: Sir Peter Rawlinson, Q.C. ^representing Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd.,Mr. Brian Neill J   the senior executives of the Daily Expressand Mr. Chapman PincherMr. A. MartinMr. A. EdwardsColonel L. G. LohanMr. W. L. GreigMr. Peter JohnsonEvidence of Mr. Chapman Pincher resumedExamination by Sir Peter Rawlinson continuedQ. We had reached page 6. We had spoken about the Friday conversation andI was just coming to the Sunday. You five at Ewhurst, do you not? A. Yes.Q. Did you spend the weekend there that weekend? A,- Yes I did.Q. On the Saturday evening you were dining with Mr. Eban?- A. Yes.Q. Did you hear that weekend at all from Colonel Lohan? A. He rang mebriefly at my home on Sunday in the evening. His purpose was to seek the telephone number of Mr. Lawson. He did not then know Mr. Lawson&apos;s name,but he knew there was this chap hawking this story around Fleet Street. I told him Lawson had no telephone number, which was true. You could only get himthrough the London University Union and only in the daytime. But I had a message that Lawson was wanting to ring me, so I had given permission for himto be given my telephone number, and I told Colonel Lohan if he rang I would let him know Colonel Lohan&apos;s home number at Charing so he could ring himif he wished.Q, Did you gather anything from the conversation? A. I gathered from the conversation, which went on a little while it was not a long one that he hadbeen alerted to the very strong Government interest, following my telephonecall to the Ministry or perhaps the Post Office, in the story and having it sup-pressed. In my statement later on this was confirmed by our further conversations in which Colonel Lohan said he had been under very considerable pressure.Q. Later that evening did Lawson ring you at your home? A. Yes. I wouldlike to comment here that Colonel Lohan&apos;s evidence said we fixed the lunch date
in that Sunday conversation. That is not correct. I had fixed previously on theFriday that I would come to his office. I could not fix a lunch date because Ihad not got my diary with me. Colonel Lohan said he would have at his office on Monday morning some official who if necessary would go into the matter and explain things more deeply.Chairman: Well, you fixed on the Monday then? A. Yes, but not at that point.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Not for lunch, but you would meet? A. Yes, I would go to his office.Q. And then did Lawson telephone you? A. Yes, and I gave him the ColoneLshome number. He just wanted to know what was happening about the story.I told him that Colonel Lohan wanted to speak to him urgently, and if he wishedto speak to Colonel Lohan this was the number to ring at Charing.Q. On Monday did you ring Colonel Lohan to fix the appointment? A. Irang him at about eleven o&apos;clock, and he asked me if I could defer the meetinguntil the afternoon as he was busy. I could not do this, as I had an appointmentat three o&apos;clock. So I suggested why did we not lunch together, which wouldgive us a couple of hours to go over the thing.Q. Did you meet at about one o&apos;clock at the Ecu de France? A. Yes. Iwas at the table, and he came in a few minutes afterwards. The first thing he did was to apologise for not bringing a security official. I said I did not expecta security official and had only booked a table for two, and that was the last Iheard of the security official. We then sat down and he said words to theeffect &quot; My God, 1 have been under terrific pressure this last forty-eight hours&quot;, and I said, &quot; You need a drink&quot;, and we ordered drinks and immediately began to discuss the question of the cable vetting story.Q. What did Colonel Lohan do or say? A. The first thing I remember himdoing was he produced these two &apos; D &apos; notices from his inside breast pocket.One was the &apos; D &apos; notice dated 27th April, 1956, and the other was the one dated30th October, 1961.Q. Did he say anything? A. Yes, there was a certain amount of conversationabout &apos; D &apos; notices. The general gist of the conversation as I remember it was thathis purpose in bringing the &apos; D &apos; notices was not to. try and tell me that his original ruling which he had given me on the Thursday that &apos; D &apos; notices didnot apply had been wrong. At no time in our conversation then or subsequentlydid he say his original ruling had been wrong, that he was mistaken and that&apos; D&apos; notices did apply after all. The gist of the conversation as I rememberit was rather Yes, these &apos; D&apos; notices did show that in fact his ruling on Thursdayhad been right, but although he thought that his ruling was still correct, pressurewas being put on him by the authorities to change his mind, but he was not goingto do that with me, an old and trusted friend. He thought they were extremelydifficult and was not going to use them. As regards the first &apos; D &apos; notice he said&quot; This could not possibly apply &quot; and as regards the second one he said &quot; Thishas a marginal application, but it is marginal and I am not going to pursue it&quot;.And he then put the &apos; D &apos; notices back into his pocket he said on the table,but I think in his pocket.Q. He referred to them by date did he? A. Yes. I recognised them; theyare the two I am most familiar with, I come up against them in my work, thereare not many &apos; D&apos; notices extant.Q. We will look at the 1956 letter and its appendix. A. Yes, I have a copyhere.Q. You say you are acquainted with this because it comes out a lot in yourwork? A. It has done over the years many many times.Q. Have you got the April, 1956, notice and the appendix? A. Yes.Q. Also the letter of 1957 and the 1961 before you?-A. Yes.Q. I am dealing with the 1956 one. Quite apart from what Colonel Lohansaid to you-and you have told us what he actually said what do you say
about that 1956 &apos; D &apos; notice which you said you knew about? A. What I am bound to say is not just my interpretation of this &apos; D&apos; notice. It is based onthe interpretations given to me by Colonel Lohan&apos;s predecessor, who was thesecretary at the time this notice came out, and since by Colonel Lohan. So it isnot just my interpretation of this, it is the interpretation based on these things.And the important paragraph, as i saw it, in this one is paragraph (i) there, whereit says:&quot;Will you please in the national interest make no reference to thefollowing:(i) Secret intelligence or counter intelligence methods and activities in or outside the United Kingdom.&quot;As I touched on yesterday, this does not refer to activities just because they are carried out in secret the methods themselves have got to be secret. A simpleobvious thing like tapping a telephone or opening a letter could not in this context be counted as a secret method. And in the past I have had storieswhere I have got hold of information about secret devices, long before thesebecame known, that could be used or were being used and we had beenasked to suppress them because this was a secret matter. This paragraph (i) has got to be read to appreciate my attitude to it in the context of the appendixover the page.Q. &quot; Note to (i)&quot;? -A. Yes, where it says this and this I think has beenput in at some time on advice, so that we do not have what we dislike most of all,a blanket &apos; D &apos; notice.  It says :&quot; Certain methods employed in Intelligence work are to some extent amatter of common knowledge and it is thus understandable that editorswould not normally regard them as secret methods.&quot;The first point I would make is that I regard the examination of cables on occasions as one of those methods which one would not normally regard as asecret method; it is an obvious method which would be mentioned in novels,like telephone tapping or the opening of letters.Q. Were you aware of the Official Secrets Act, section 4? A. Yes. And then it goes on:&quot; Published reference, however, to what may seem to be obvious methodsof counter espionage work, when related to particular cases or persons,create an awareness and vigilance in the minds of agents which may wellenable them to circumvent the precautions taken to deal with them.&quot;Well of course that I have always understood. And there have been experiencesin the past where we have been asked to keep things out because there was a specific operation in progress directed at particular persons or cases, and we have always done so. But this particular story I had previously raised with colonel lohan and which we were discussing at the lunch did not refer to particular casesor persons. It referred to the regular daily routine checking of cables. And Ispecifically asked Colonel Lohan during the lunch and I rather think he has confirmed this in his evidence whether there was a particular operation involved and the answer was whether I asked him or he volunteered I cannot remember but there was not a particular operation in progress at that time. Therefore Iassumed that the &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply in this particular instance, and I also assumed that the rapidity with which these were set aside meant that he was of the same opinion.Q. If it had been all the cables from a particular organisation that were beingvetted, a particular named organisation, would you have considered that to havebeen under the &apos; D&apos; notice or not? A. Indeed, because that would have been aparticular operation. I would have counted that as a particular operation. an operation need not be directed at one person, but at a subversive agency.Q. Very well. Then was there any conversation with him at this stage aboutyour story and it being said this vetting was a routine business? A. Yes. Theimpression I got from the conversation with Colonel Lohan throughout thelunch was that he was in no way denying the accuracy of the story, that it wasa routine thing that was going on, and after we had got rid of the &apos; D&apos; notices,
they had been put away, he went on to explain in support of his request that weshould not publish the sort of thing that was going on. This as I understood itwas absolutely in confidence, and it was in order to convince me that we werenot to print the thing. It was to give strength to his request that we should not use it in the paper. This was to the effect that provided you have access toall the cables skilled operators can seek out a pattern of activity and from thatpattern of activity, they may be put on to subversive activities. It was quiteobvious to me what he meant. And presumably he must have said the sameto the Daily Mail, because it appeared in the Daily Mail on the morning theyfollowed up the story. I considered it had been given in confidence, and we did not use it. And this confirmed my view, which had I think been held byMr. CBrien of the Post Office, that this was a routine regular business. AndI remember saying &quot; No doubt you do find some very interesting information,but I think it is going rather far in a free society &quot;. It was on that sort oftopic that I got vehement, not on the &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. Just to finish &apos; D &apos; notices, what is your recollection of the 1961 one?Chairman: There is one in between, the telephone tapping letter.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Did he have that with him? A. No.Chairman: You did not discuss it? A. We discussed telephone tapping, sir,but not in the context of that particular letter, only in the context of how telephone tapping was a similar operation in my view to looking at cables in fact I wouldhave thought that telephone tapping was a much more sensitive affair than looking at cables, because it involved secret methods.Q. It is enough for the moment to say the question of telephone tapping arosebetween you, as a parallel? A. Yes.Q. And that in fact had been dealt with to some extent by a &apos; D&apos; noticesubsequent to 1956? A. Yes, and I was aware of the existence of that; it wasnot with us.   But it does not matter, we did not discuss it, the actual letter.Sir Peter Rawlinson: And on the &apos; D &apos; notice of 1961 you say he had that withhim? A. Yes, he had the 1961 with him. As I understood it he dismissed thatas marginal. He said this could apply, but was marginal there was a colloquialexpression, which does not matter it meant we can get rid of it. Because thesame thing applies there in paragraph 2, which is only one of the matters inthis context it talks about the various methods used in the interception offoreign communications for secret intelligence purposes, and says that in thisconnection the Committee request that you will not refer to the fact that on occasions it is necessary in the interest of defence for the Services to interceptsuch communications. But this was not a matter of cables being interceptedon occasions, which would have meant specific operations directed against some-body, and I thought he meant that this was not applicable&apos; in this case.Q. You told us he may have used a colloquial expression and put the :&apos; D&apos;notices back in his pocket; that is your recollection? A. That is my recollection.Q. Then on page 9 of your statement, you briefly reminded Colonel Lohanthat a similar &apos; D &apos; notice situation had arisen in the past with respect to telephone tapping? A. That similar difficulties had arisen, a similar &apos; D &apos; notice situation had arisen with telephone tapping. The situation there is and I think I wasthe instigator of this that Admiral Thomson it goes back a long way^-thatat one stage the security authorities requested the Admiral to approach me, andno doubt other papers too, to say that on no account would we mention thesuggestion that security people or any Government agent tapped telephones,even in the most general sense. It arose about a series of articles I was doingon security. It was at the time of the Fuchs case. His point, which was quite a good one, was that whenever you mention telephone tapping there are alwayssome chaps you are trying to keep tabs on, and the moment you mention tele-phone tapping it alerts them and they stop making telephone calls. I did notthink this was a very strong argument myself, but there was a point in it.Eventually he agreed it was quite ridiculous not to mention in a general sense of espionage and counter-espionage that telephones were sometimes tapped,
because this was in foreign papers and in novels. And it was as a result of several efforts on my part to get it made clear that telephone tapping was allright to talk about that this other &apos;D&apos; notice was produced.Q. If you look at the letter of 31st October, 1957, that is a letter which says:&quot; Reference the Privy Councils report of ^telephone tapping&apos;, I am asked by the Services Press and Broadcasting Committee to invite your attentionto &apos; D &apos; notice of 27th April, 1956 which requests you not to mention theidentities, methods or activities of our secret agents and counter agents &quot;.And in the second paragraph it says:&quot;In view of the Privy Councils report, you can no longer be asked tomaintain secrecy on the use of &apos; telephone tapping&apos; as one of the methodsemployed by the security service &quot;.In the report, page 29, paragraph 133 it refers to the opening or reading of lettersor the interception of letters, whether by reading or opening, and it says this isregarded with general disfavour. In one paragraph it puts letters, telegrams and telephone calls all together in referring to matters of interception. A. IfI may say so there, in my recollection I cannot remember talking to the Admiralor Colonel Lohan about cables before, but I have spoken to both about theopening of letters, and I have always understood that telephone tapping was amuch more sensitive business so far as security people were concerned thanthe opening of letters, because everybody knows letters can easily be opened,but telephone tapping seems a gross intrusion because it is getting into yourhome, whereas opening letters outside and away is something not quite as badas telephone tapping. That is why I think this specific thing about telephone tapping was put out and letters were not mentioned.Q. The discussion then turned to telephone tapping? A. Yes.Q. What happened after you had discussed this page 9 of your statement?Did he make a request to you to do something?-A. Yes. First of all, I gathered from the conversation he had made it quite clear to the people putting pressure on him it was no good pushing these &apos; D &apos; notices as a means of suppressingthe story, because they were not really very watertight. He then said he would nevertheless have to ask me in his capacity as secretary of the &apos; D&apos; Notice Com-mittee to make a formal request that we should npt publish the story in spiteof that.Q. I think you have told us about the illustration given. A. Yes.Q. He said on two or three occasions you got very heated in expressing yourpoint of view about this intrusion. A. Yes. I think what he said was I gotheated in arguments about the &apos; D &apos; notices.   That is not correct.Q. He said on one or two different occasions. A. I &quot;think it would be fair tosay I was vehement about the question of what I considered was a generalintrusion into the privacy of people in respect of routine availability of cablesto the security authorities every day. And on one particular point, which Ithink he mentioned, I said &quot; This implies that all the Service messages whichthe Daily Express, for example, sends to its bureaux all over the world if neces-sary are made available for scrutiny, and this could be damaging to us on occasions if we were sending things to our New York office suggesting theylook into something that the security people might not want us to look into,but nevertheless we want to do it in the matter of public interest&quot;. I said thatthis could be damaging. I think he rather agreed with me, but said&quot; Nevertheless I am asking you with all the force that I can to ask the editornot to print the story.Q. Can you put your view to the committee, Mr. Chapman Pincher? Did youignore the safety of the State or the security of the State wholly when looking at it only from the newspapers interests, or not? A. No. Of course my attitude was entirely modified by the fact that the decision did not rest with me anyway,that I was not going to be the person who would have to say &quot;This will be printed &quot; or &quot; This will not be printed &quot;, and I was giving Colonel Lohan my own opinions about it, and they would not colour the story in any way because it
was not a feature story, we could only state the facts. It was up to the editor.And if he asked my advice I would say &quot; In this instance, since it was a routinething going on every day, there was a strong case for publication &quot;.Q. Was your attitude &quot; To the devil with the security of the State. This is something for the interests of the newspaper &quot;, or were you balancing the publicinterest of knowledge that this happens against security? A. I think colonel lohan will confirm that I was balancing it, because we had quite a considerable discussion. I said that I appreciated they would get some interesting information,but that it was at rather a high price. But in that context I might say and Ithink again Colonel Lohan will confirm this that there have been numerousinstances in the past where in my opinion we have spiked far better stories than this one in the public interest because the balance came down the other way.And there have been cases which I have not even bothered to tell the editorabout because of this.Chairman: Mr. Pincher, do you mean stories in the past that were withinexisting &apos;D &apos; notices, or stories on general grounds? A. Stories which had beenagreed in discussion with Colonel Lohan&apos;s predecessor, and I think with theColonel himself, could not be stopped under &apos; D &apos; notice.Q. Not within &apos; D &apos; notice?-A. Yes.Q. When you have advised your editor not to print the story, or have not even submitted the story to your editor? A. On many occasions the thinghas not got to the editor even. There was a specific point. I think I shouldmention this to you to explain why Colonel Lohan took this attitude with meabout not bothering with the &apos; D &apos; notices. And that as in the past it hasalways been possible to do this in other words, tell me about it and for me ifnecessary even to suppress the story without going any further. But in this case there was a great difficulty because the Mail was already involved and thisfellow was also talking of going to agencies. So I could not, as it were, do adeal with Colonel Lohan on the old pals act and say &quot; All right, we will forgetit&quot;. If this had been something I had found out myself and I had believed itwas wrong, nothing need have been heard about it. But the Mail had it, theyhad it before we did. And although Colonel Lohan told me before he went tothe Mail, he was certain the Mail was in the bag, I could not be sure of that.Q. So it was not unusual for you in the past to receive either from AdmiralThomson or Colonel Lohan an appeal on the lines &quot;With regard to this story,we do not think it is covered by &apos; D &apos; notice but in the public interest or national security, or whatever the phrase is, will you not use it? &quot; A. I can think ofmany instances, and I cannot think of any instance where it has been used, atthe time. There have been occasions where we have agreed on a compromisesituation where we held it out very often for months. I could, give the committeeexamples of this if they would like to have them.Mr. Shinwell: Could you give an example of a case where you refrained from taking action of reporting to the editor? A. The one that immediatelycomes to mind is this: I had some information just shortly before FrankIBossard, the spy in the Ministry of Aviation was arrested. I did not know thatit was Bossard but I knew there was a spy active in the Ministry of Aviation. Iwanted to use that information in something I was writing and I approachedColonel Lohan and he said, &quot; On no account&quot;. He did not give me the reasons why, he did not need to ; he said &quot; Not now, chum &quot;. I did not even tell the editor.Chairman: Would that not have been covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice, counter-espionage? A. I think probably the way I wanted to write it it would not have[been. One of the things about the &apos;D&apos; Notice Committee which is very important is that very often we get information and we go to the secretary of the com-mittee and he says &quot;You cannot say that&quot; that is when one has given him a story to vet &quot; But if you say it this way you will avoid the &apos; D &apos; notice impli-cation &quot;. And I think we could have done this in this case. But they wantednothing at that stage. It might of course I do not know when it was explained to me it was enough have put the spy on guard.
Sir Peter Rawlinson: You set these things out on pages 15 and 16? A. Yes.They were in Admiral Thomson&apos;s time.Chairman: And they would be cases where it was common ground that &apos; D &apos;notices did not extend to them but nevertheless you threw them away? A. Yes.I would like to mention one which has since been published in the memoirs ofArthur Christiansen of the Express page 16. This I considered to be a much better newspaper story than the one we are talking about. This was a situationin which trainee British secret agents kidnapped the wrong man. Instead of another trainee they kidnapped a clerk. And the whole details of that storyare so hilarious that it would have made a fantastic tale. It was admitted by admiral Thomson that under the &apos; D&apos; notice on training methods this thingcould hardly be said to be a secret training method, it was just like a militaryexercise. But nevertheless he asked me under the old pals act to ask the editor not to print the story. And with great difficulty this was achieved. Thatis another example where it was agreed by the secretary of the &apos; D &apos; noticeCommittee that&apos; D &apos; notice did not really cover it.Q. It was a &apos; D&apos; notice subject? A. There is hardly anything, sir, that couldnot be said to be a &apos; D &apos; notice subject, because of the blanket nature of these.Mr. Shinwell: What was the date of that? A. It was in the &apos;fifties. Asa wild guess I would say 1955.  But I could find out and let you know.Q. Apart from the incident you have mentioned, the Bossard case, are there any similar cases in the last two-and-a-half or three years? A. I cannot think of any at the moment, but I could go through my cuttings book and submitthese to the committee.Q. In the time of Admiral Thomson you had several cases you did not proceedwith? A. Yes. There have also been some with Colonel Lohan. I can give you a very good example, if I may I have just recalled it. This is a recentone, and is public knowledge. A few months ago the Director of the security services retired and a new Director was appointed. It has always been under-stood that the identity of the Director of the Security Services will not berevealed, and this is part of one of the &apos; D &apos; notices here, the same one, 1956,about identity of persons actively engaged in their duties. And when he retiredI did a short piece, with the agreement of Colonel Lohan, to say that he hadretired, but of course did not mention his name. A photographer thought itwould be a splendid idea to get a picture of the back of him on the day of hisretirement walking down the street into oblivion, this great man, but he wouldnot show his face, or anything like that. I thought this was reasonable. He wasnot actively engaged any longer, and it would not reveal his identity, or I didnot think so. I suggested this, and Colonel Lohan said he did not like it, thatit would be feasible for a fellow to be identified from behind. I told the editorthis, and the editor scotched the whole thing and the project was abandoned.This is very recent.   I think it was only last October &quot;that he retired.Mr. Shinwell: Thank you.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Now we have come to the end of the lunch page 11.What was your view? You had had the lunch. You had had the telephone callson the Sunday and the Friday, and the telephone conversation on the Thursday,and Colonel Lohan had told you he was under pressure? A. Yes.Q. What was in your mind as you left that lunch with regard to his requestand what you were going to do about it? A. It was very straightforward. I was absolutely convinced that the original ruling that &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply onthe Thursday had been fully justified by a brief examination of such &apos; D&apos; noticesas might have applied. He had made the strongest possible request to me toask the editor not to print it as a personal request from him on behalf of theGovernment. He knew I would put that request forward because we were veryold friends and I was duty bound to do so. Incidentally, if he had told me!&quot; Look, I was mistaken on Thursday, the &apos; D&apos; notice does apply, and I wantyou to tell the editor &quot; I should have done so. But I left satisfied that the &apos; D &apos;notice did not apply. It was a matter of requesting the editor not to print it,of getting him to agree to that. But I said if I were the editor I would not.And I think I said &quot; If you were the editor you would not either &quot;.
Q. You mean you would not agree?-A. I would not grant the request.I would consider it further but I would probably print it. However, there wasno reason at that point why Colonel Lohan should be downcast about the thing,because always in the past the editor acceded to his request and on occasionoverruled me, as with the picture of the Director of the Security Services. so he had every reason to be confident at that stage that I would put the requestforward properly. What Colonel Lohan could have done when he came to therestaurant would have been to say &quot; I am not going to discuss it with you. I amgoing to see the editor&quot;. But on the basis of our previous experience he was really on a better wicket with me, I think, and I would have done the same.It was better for him to get me on his side and for me to go to the editor and say this. Well, his argument did not convince me. Nevertheless I went tothe editor and eventually put forward the request.Q. You then left the restaurant and returned to the office. Did you writethe story when you got back in the course of the afternoon? A. Yes, I hadto do that. You cannot go in to the editor, who is a very busy man, just withan idea.Q. You took it in to him at what time? I should think it was about a quarterto six.Q. When was the first time that the editor knew anything at all about the story about cable vetting? A. At that moment.Q. At that time? A. At a quarter to six on the Monday. Until that timethe editor knew nothing about the story, nothing about Lawson, nothing aboutColonel Lohan being involved with me.Q. Did you see Sir Max Aitken and say anything whatsoever to him aboutthe cable vetting story? A. No. There were only two people in the officewho knew about it, myself and the news editor, to whom I mentioned it casuallyon the Friday. The reason is very simple. There is no point in going to the editor with a story which might not survive. And I had spoken to colonel lohan quite definitely on the Friday and he had told me this was a securitybusiness. I said to the news editor &quot; I am working on a story which may come to nothing because of security. There is no point in involving Mr. Marksat the moment&quot;, and he agreed. I said &quot; I will discuss it with you again onMonday &quot;. So we were the only two people who knew, apart from my secre-tary. I had not seen Sir Max for many weeks, and I do not think the newseditor had.Q. You took it in to him? A. Yes.Q. And did you pass on Colonel Lohan&apos;s request? A. Yes. I gave him the story. I said &quot; You need not worry about &apos; D &apos; notices, they are not involved,but Colonel Lohan has made the strongest request . . . &quot;-and I used these wordsIbecause the Colonel asked me to use them &quot; that I should use all my powers ofpersuasion in asking you not to print it&quot;. I also told him what Colonel Lohanhad told me, that he had been under great pressure from the Government on thisduring the last forty-eight hours, and it was a Government matter.Q. Did you say that to the editor? A. Oh yes, indeed.Q. I think we can take this next part quite quickly. Were these called in,Mr. Raybould, the deputy editor, Mr. Peter Johnson, the news editor, and Mr.Andrew Edwards, the legal manager? A. Yes.Q. And in their presence did he ask you again about &apos; D&apos; notices? A. Yes.Q. What did you say? A. First of all I told him that Colonel Lohan hadruled that &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply on the previous Thursday, and he had agreed over the lunch they did not really apply in this case and he was notpushing them at all.Q. Did you say anything about having a row after that? A. Yes, I said&quot; Of course there will be a row tomorrow &quot;. And by that I meant that when-ever Colonel Lohan, or the secretary, loses a battle the department do not likeit and he has to explain to them why he has lost the battle.  Usually he wins.
But they do not like it when they lose the battle. Colonel Lohan mentionedan incident, which he said I would not recollect but I did, . . .Q. I think there was some talk about the Official Secrets Act, section 4, andthe editor asked about that? A. Yes.Q. Did you tell him about Lawson not signing the Official Secrets form? A.II think I mentioned Lawson when I first went in with the story, but once wehad confirmed his information we wanted no more to do with Lawson.Q. But did you speak about the form? A. Yes.Q. Was section 4 of the Official Secrets Act looked at and referred to? A.Yes, Mr. Edwards had the document in his hand. Mr. Edwards and I went intogether.Q. Did the editor say that section 4 powers should be referred to in the story? A. Yes, he said we had better get a mention of section 4 and I wentback and inserted another paragraph in the story.Q. After this, about 6.30, did you have a conversation with Colonel Lohan? A. Yes, I telephoned him at his office to tell him I had written the storyand I had taken it in to the editor and I had told the editor of his request,including the bit about all powers of persuasion. And I told him if we did decide to print the story that night I would inform him. There is a reasonwhich I should explain to the committee as to why I just could not say to colonel Lohan the moment I thought the editor was going to print it &quot; Look,I think he is going to print&quot;, because I knew in spite of what he said about the daily Mail being in the bag, that he would be duty bound to ring the daily mail and say &quot; The Express is going to print&quot;. It could not be possible for meto be certain that night until 8.15 that we were going to print that night. the editor may have decided to print but not that night, if something big had come in. But if Colonel Lohan rang the Mail and said we were going to print,the Mail could have come out with the story. So I had to be certain before Irang Colonel Lohan, who I knew would ring the Mail and tell them that wewere printing that night. So I told him &quot; I cannot be sure we are printingtonight until 8.15 &quot;.Q. What did he say to that? A. He then said: &quot; That will be too late forme, because I shall be on the train, and you will not be able to get me until9.30 &quot;. I know in his evidence Colonel Lohan has said we did not discuss traintimes, but this is not correct, because I did not know, unless he had told me,where he would be that night, because Colonel Lohan very often stays the night in town. And I rang him at Charing, his home, at 9.30, and his first remark when rang v/as: &quot; I have just walked in &quot;. He asked me to ring him at 9.30 atCharing, and I did so.Q. Did you agree to do that? A. Yes.Q. Colonel Lohan says that between six and seven o&apos;clock on that eveningyou had several telephone conversations, and also you sent up for copies of the&apos; D &apos; notice from his office? A. That is quite incorrect, there were only twotelephone calls on that night: one was at 6.30, when I agreed to ring him at  .30, and the other was the 9.30 one.Q. The 6.30 one was to his office, and the 9.30 one to his home? A. AtCharing, yes. He is confusing two days here.Q. Have you checked whether any messenger went from the Daily Express toShell Mex House, to his office, to collect any &apos; D &apos; notices on Monday, 20thFebruary? A. No, nobody went.Q. You have checked? A. I have checked, yes.Q. And the answer is no? A. The answer is no.Q. Did somebody go up on the Tuesday, the day after this was published, on the21st? A. Yes, to collect two &apos;D&apos; notices, and the reason I wanted them was. . . .Sir Peter Rawlinson: Let us just get the facts first.
Chairman: I dare say it does not very much matter, but it is said that areceipt was given for those &apos; D &apos; notices. If it was, I suppose it exists, andhas a date.  Have you got the document, Colonel Lohan?Colonel Lohan: I have not got it on me, my lord, but it is dated Mondaythe 20th.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Mr. Pincher, do you produce in fact the list what isit called? A. Yes, this is the messengers&apos; list.Q. For the 20th, that day?-A. Yes.Q. Does it show any messenger going up to Shell Mex House, to colonel lohan, that day? A. No, it does not.Chairman: Colonel Lohan, where is the document?Colonel Lohan: In my office.Chairman: Can you send for it?Colonel Lohan: I can.Chairman: Because, you see, while we have got Mr. Pincher here the thingcan be cleared up one way or the other. You have got no records in youroffice, Mr. Pincher, of anybody leaving on such a mission on the Monday? A. No, but on the Tuesday definitely, and the time and the return.Sir Peter Rawlinson: What was the time? A. The time out was 4.40, andthe time back with the two &apos; D &apos; notices was 5.10, a youth called Smallman.Q. He is in the office now at the Daily Express, is he not? A. Yes. Thenon Wednesday, when I was addressing a conference in Harrogate and I hadtaken those two &apos; D &apos; notices with me in case I should be needed on the telephone,my secretary sent out for two more on the Wednesday, because I had gotthose for somebody else in the office who wanted them.Q. Sent out to Colonel Lohan? A. Yes.Q. Is there a record of a messenger going on Wednesday to Colonel Lohan? A. Yes, a boy called Floyd.Chairman: I do not know that it matters very much, but you say youknew the &apos; D &apos; notices by heart anyway? A. Well, it is nice, sir, when you arebeing questioned on anything like this on the telephone, to have it with you.I was at Harrogate on a conference.Sir Peter Rawlinson: The point is, you say there was only one telephone callthat night from you to Lohan? A. That is right.Q. In which you arranged to telephone him the definite news at 9.30 that evening? A. Correct.Chairman: You have a set of &apos;D&apos; notices? A. No, I do not, Sir, I personally have never had a set of &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. You did not let me finish my sentence: you have a set of &apos; D&apos; notices inthe office, which is kept in some secure place? A. Yes.Q. Either in the editor&apos;s room or, I think, the news room? A. The newsroom, that is right, in the safe.Q. You do not yourself keep possession of a copy? A. No.Q. But you say you know them very well? A. I have access to them, andone has sort of lived with them for so many years. But if I may say so, it isimportant, sir, to understand why I sent for these things on the Tuesday. Theywere of no value to me on the Monday, we had just had a discussion about them with Lohan at the table ; but on the following day I needed them to write the answer to the Prime Ministers statement, because the Prime Ministercame out and said in the House, &quot; You have breached two &apos; D&apos; notices&quot;.I then needed to have them right there, and they were not easily available inthe office, I could not find the fellow with the key to the safe, and ColonelLchan&apos;s office is only up the street, five minutes or so, so we sent out to gettwo copies.Sir Peter Rawlinson: That you said was 6.30 ; did you leave the office atseven? A. Yes, I left the office at seven to go home.
Q. Did you arrange with Mr. Johnson to discover the final decision and to telephone?-A. Yes, I discovered that Mr. Johnson would be on the nightdesk, and I arranged to ring him.Q. Did you know where the editor was going that evening? Did you knowabout this dinner? A. No, I was not invited to the dinner, I did not knowabout thatQ. Did you arrive at your home at about 8.30? A. Yes.Q. And you telephoned to Mr. Johnson at 9 p.m.? A. Yes.Q. Did you find out from him that it had been decided to lead the paper, and did you telephone Colonel Lohan? A. Yes, on the dot of 9.30.Q. What did he say? A. He said: &quot; I have just walked in the house &quot;, andI said words to this effect: &quot; You have lost &quot;, or &quot; Your luck&apos;s out&quot;, or perhapsboth. And he said &quot;Oh good lord &quot;, like that not &quot; Oh good lord &quot;, and hesaid: &quot;111 have to ring the Express&quot;, and I said: &quot;That is perfectly all right for you to do so &quot;, and he knew the number, there was no need to tell him the number, and we hung up.Q. I think later that night this is page 13 of your proof you were telephonedabout two wholly different stories from the Express, about 10.45? A. Yes Ialways am.Q. The editor is going to say he tried to contact you about 11.30, and couldnot. A. Yes, apparently this often happens the telephone was not functioning,at least not in my bedroom, at 11.30. By that time I had gone to bed, and theother calls came when I was downstairs, so it may have been something to do with one of the extensions, but they even got to the stage, the next morning, of having a motor-cyclist, who almost found me I live in a very remote area.But I could not have been of any assistance, except simply to reiterate what had happened between myself and Colonel Lohan.Q. Then did you think that by that publication there was a clear breach of&apos; D &apos; notice? A. On the contrary, and when I saw the Prime Ministers statement i was absolutely astonished.Q. You saw that on Tuesday, the 21st? A. Yes.Q. Did you, having seen that statement, telephone Colonel Lohan? A. Yes,immediately.Q. What did he say to you? A. I said: &quot; Have you seen what is coming outon the tapes?&quot; He said: &quot;No, read it to me&quot;, and I read it to him, and I said: &quot; But you said when I rang you on Thursday that the &apos; D&apos; notices do notapply &quot;, and he agreed that they did not apply.Q. When you say he agreed, what exactly do you recollect him saying? A. I said: &quot; Didn&apos;t you say that they did not apply?&quot; and he said &quot; Yes &quot;, and I said:&quot;Do you still say so?&quot;, and he said &quot;Yes&quot;.   This was on the Thursday ruling.Q. Did he say anything about the brief which had be,en given to the PrimeMinister being based on anything he had said? A. Yes, he said: &quot;That wastiot based on any brief provided by me &quot;, and he repeated that when I was in contact with him later on.Q. Did you write a piece which appeared in the Daily Express of Wednesday,22nd February?-A. Yes, I did.Q. Which was I think entitled &quot; Charge refuted &quot;? A. Yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Have you got that, my lord?Chairman: I have certainly read it, yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Very well, then I will not deal with it. Did you speak to Colonel Lohan on the telephone that day, the Wednesday? A. Yes afterthe refutation?Q. Yes. A. I rang him up to see what he thought about the piece.Q. What do you recollect he said? A. First of all I could not get him,because his secretary said he was down making some sort of deposition, thenwhen I did get him later on he told me he had been under tremendous pres-sures concerning this statement that he had dictated. I think he had been to theMinistry of Defence with some secretary, and had to dictate a statement.159
Q. Then just generally, were your relations with Colonel Lohan those, ashe said of friends? A. Absolutely, and, you know, great mutual trust.Q. What is your view, if the &apos; D&apos; notice is not being applied to a particularstory, but Colonel Lohan is making a request, do you agree or disagree withthe view that that is tantamount to a &apos; D &apos; notice? A. I disagree with it, becausewith a &apos; D &apos; notice the press members have had the opportunity to reject itor to have it amended, but a request which comes straight from the mouth of a Government official has not got any press sanction that way, and that is why I consider that the request is much weaker than the &apos; D&apos; notice.Q. What is your view as to the editor&apos;s discretion? Has the editor a discretionunder the procedure as you understand it, if the secretary is only relying on a personal request? A. If the request procedure, if I may use that phrase, is admitted as part of the machinery and it is it obviously must be possible forthe editor to refuse the request. If the request were to be granted every time it would be an order. That is surely what I understand by the request pro-cedure: he makes a request, sometimes the request is granted and sometimesit may not be.Q. What is your view, if the secretary says the &apos; D &apos; notice does apply, eventhough you disagree, even though you have argued and said: &quot; This is non-sense, this is ludicrous &quot;, but the secretary persists and says: &quot; No, my rulingis that the &apos; D&apos; notice does apply &quot;? What do you say the position is then? A. The position is that I must tell that to the editor, whatever I may feel,and this has arisen in the past, and that really is the end of it, because themoment I tell the editor: &quot; Look, the &apos; D&apos; notice applies &quot;, that is it, the storywill not be printed. It will then be taken up by the committee, perhaps the editor might write to the committee, but on that particular night, if I had goneback and said: &quot; Look, Lohan originally said the &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply,now he says they definitely do &quot;, I think he would not have printed the storythat night.   It has never happened before.Q. Did you deliberately take part, Mr. Pincher, in any breach of the spiritof the &apos; D &apos; notice? This is what Colonel Lohan has said, that it is a breach of thespirit of the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure. A. On the contrary, what I would ask the com-mittee to accept is that after I have co-operated for twenty years over this matter,very often at considerable loss of news to the paper, in my opinion, there wouldbe no possible purpose in doing it for just this one story.Q. On page 15 you say:&quot; But every newspaper must feel itself free to reject a verbal request madeby the Secretary of the Committee that is not based on a &apos; D &apos; notice. Other-wise there is nothing to stop the Government using the existence of the &apos; D &apos;notice Committee as a means of imposing censorship at any time it likes &quot;.We have had examples of that, but could we just make it clear that that is &quot; any government&quot; as opposed to &quot; the Government&quot;? A. Oh yes. This story I would like to point this out to the committee too has nothing whatever todo with this particular Government, and I made a point of putting into that firstoriginal story published on the Tuesday that this had been going on for several years, I could not establish how long but I said it had been done for several years. And most of the experiences, in fact all the ones I can think of, whereefforts have been made to use the &apos; D&apos; notice for what I consider to be cen-sorship purposes were made by the previous Government. Mr. Macmillan wenton record a little while ago saying what a damn nuisance I had been to him inthose days.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Very well. That is all I have to ask Mr. Pincher.Chairman: Mr. Pincher, I want to ask you one or two questions. I wantif I can to see, since we have not got a cross-examining counsel, to what extent on matters which are of importance you and Colonel Lohan, who gave his evidencethe other day and you heard it really differ. Your first communication wason the Thursday, I think? A. Yes.  I think we differ very greatly on that.
Q. I just want to get clear how much you differ. Your query was based onalleged practice of the Ministry of Defence? A. No, Sir, the query I put upto him was exactly the same query that I put up to Wing Commander Harris,and which I had already put up to Wing Commander Harris before I rangColonel Lohan. I put that up about three o&apos;clock, as Wing Commander Harrissaid, and this was that I told him the story about the cables being collected from cable companies for vetting and taken to branches of the Ministry ofDefence. Would such a story be covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice?Q. That does not seem to me to differ from what I was saying to you. Yourang Wing Commander Harris because he was the Ministry of Defence pressofficer? A. That is right, but I thought Colonel Lohan said I only referred toG.P.O. telegrams.Q. Now listen to me, Mr. Pincher. I will come to that, where I think you dodiffer, but your story as it stood at that time seemed to refer to activities whichwere said to be those of the Ministry of Defence, is that right? A. What was important, sir, was what was in my mind, and what I understood from my pre-vious knowledge of these sorts of exercises was that the cables were collectedon behalf of the security authorities, and it was done through the Ministry ofDefence.Q. I am sure it was in your mind, because the Ministry of Defence might wellbe an agent for any other authority, but actually what you were dealing withwas what was said to be done at that time by the Ministry of Defence? A. Yes.Q. But I quite understand, you say you referred to collections made from the offices of the cable companies? A. Yes.Q. Commercial Cable and Western Union? A. Yes.Q. And his idea was that you were referring to collection from the G.P.O.?-A. Yes.Q. And on that point you differ in your recollections? A. Yes.Q. On the Friday, when you say he spoke to you, he conveyed to you theimpression that this story related to a matter of great importance to the Govern-ment? A. Yes.Q. But you say he made no reference to the bearing of &apos; D &apos; notices upon it? A. None whatever, just the diplomatic furore argument.Q. When you came to what I suppose must have been the critical meeting,which was the lunch at the L&apos;Ecu de France on the Monday, I think it is common ground that he arrived with two Defence Notices? A. Three.Q. Which he produced from his pocket? A. Yes. -Q. And that, if not the first thing, was at an early stage of your discussion? A. Indeed.Q. If he was producing Defence Notices at that time, to some extent itmust have shown that he was taking a different attitude to the answer he had given you on the Thursday? A. No, sir. I am sorry, I did not make it plain:as the discussion progressed, what was quite clear was that what he was sayingto me was: &quot; Look, I was right, but the boys . . .&quot; the people, the officials,who had been at him over the 48 hours were trying to make him change his mind, and saying that this &apos; D&apos; notice applied and that &apos; D&apos; notice applied.&quot;In fact&quot;, he said, &quot; that cannot be made to apply, and this one is so bloodymarginal we can put it away &quot;.Q. I do want you to be very careful about this, because I find it very difficultto believe that he arrived with those documents at his meeting with you simply to agree with you that they had no relevant application. A. He was alsogoing on to the Daily Mail, where he seemed, according to the evidence, toadopt a similar attitude with them, that although he had them with him theywere of very marginal application. But what I assure you is that in the courseof our discussion that was how the &apos; D&apos; notices were approached and how they161
were left, and as far as the first one was concerned he said it could not possiblyapply, and the second one had this marginal application, but he was not goingjto pursue it.Q. I want you just to have before your mind what he said in his evidence ;if you would just look at page 4 of the transcript, this is his recollection of the events:&quot; I sat down on his right and immediately produced from my insidepocket ... a copy of two &apos; D &apos; notices. One was a &apos; D &apos; notice dated30th October, 1961 which deals with the interception of communications,and the other of 27th April, 1956 which dealt among other things withmethods used by the intelligence services. Almost immediately there might have been a word or two but I have no recollection of it but almost immediately Chapman Pincher waved them aside and said, &apos; I know the mall by heart&apos;. I thought that was rather amazing and I said, &apos; So do I, butthat is not the point&apos;. I said, &apos; All right, just a second&apos;. I then went offon another tack.&quot;and I think that is all for the moment, because he said &quot; I know there is political embarrassment about this&quot;, and then over the page I then went back again to the &apos; D &apos; notices, do you see that? A. Yes, I see it and heard him say it.Q. Then he said:&quot; I opened them up as it were, and looked at them again and put myfinger on it, there are about ten words involved, a line on one and a coupleof lines on another, and again Pincher waved it aside and said, &apos; No, no, theydo not apply&apos;, and he then argued that the &apos; D &apos; notice of 27th April,1956-&quot;He is then asked:&quot;Q. Did you point to any particular part of these? They are quitelong. A. I am not going to read them to you. I then pointed to thisparticular part, and it was the only part I was concerned with.:     Q. On the 1956 one did you point to &quot;and he then quotes head (i). Do you recollect none of that? A. No.Q. That directing your attention to those particular words? A. I do not,and furthermore I am quite sure that if I had attempted to wave &apos; D &apos; noticesaside, Colonel Lohan would not have accepted it. I have no authority to waveaside &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. He then goes on in his recollection:&quot;He argued vehemently that the collection of telegrams and cables was an absolute parallel, and he was quite strong about this view, very strongindeed, it was an absolute parallel to telephone tapping or opening of mail;in other words it did not come under &apos; D&apos; notices.&quot; A. Yes, that was part of the conversation after the &apos; D &apos; notices had been putback in his pocket.Q. And then he tells me that he thought you did have a point there, and hequotes the 1957 letter about telephone tapping. A. Yes.Q. Which I will have a look at with you, if I may, now:&quot; ... it is quite clear telephone tapping was out as being required to have any kind of secrecy.&quot;He said you were very vehement. A. I would like to point out this aboutthe angle of vehemence: it does not make any sense, Colonel Lohan was myguest at lunch in a rather crowded restaurant, and a point I remember was thatas we went in he stopped at a table and he spoke to somebody there, and when we got to our table, which was not very far away, he said to me: &quot;Do you know him? &quot;, and I said I did not, and he said: &quot; Oh, he is one of the intelligencewallahs &quot;, and we sat down, and he never mentioned him in the conversation,but I just want to show how very very near people were, and one could not getvery vehement or angry without creating a scene.
Q. It was Colonel Lohan&apos;s answer, I think, to Mr. Shinwell, that you reallyhad a very withdrawn table. A. Well, it can be seen, it is the end one on theright in the main room in the L&apos;Ecu de France, and one can talk quietly per-perfectly freely without being overheard, but one could not have vehement andangry scenes, which is rather the picture that he painted in his evidence. AsI say, furthermore, he was my guest at lunch.Q. I do not know that I am very much influenced by that, because you had come together to have an important talk, at your invitation? A. Yes.Q. Never mind. Then according to what he says at the bottom of page 6, Ithink you went on to have a discussion or controversy about the applicationof the 1961 Notice, and you said: &quot;How in the name of heaven can you pretendthis is the interception of foreign communications? &quot;, and he gave an answer. A. I do not remember that at all, not at all.Q. And he says, at the top of the next page that it was only after that thathe said: &quot; All right, let us put that aside and let us argue now even more generally on why you should not publish this story &quot;. A. As I recollect it and I have a very clear mental picture of that lunch the &apos; D &apos; notice discussionlasted only a few minutes, and then they were put away, or, as Colonel Lohansaid, set aside, and apart from occasional references to telephone tapping in thecourse of the conversation, comparisons between that and cables, when he wastrying to get me on his side to get me to support his request to the editor, theywere not referred to again. I have given you what I believe to be a completelyhonest account of what I heard with my ears and saw with my eyes at thatlunch, and I went straight back to the editor and told him the same story.Q. I want now to see if you agree with this, which I gathered from his evidence: you arrived for lunch, you were at the lunch . , . A. I was at the table.Q. . . . very clear in your own mind, I think, that these Defence Noticesieally had no bearing on this subject at all? A. I had been told that. Theyhad not been raised again, and when he brought them up I was rather surprised,because there was nothing in the conversations on the telephone since theThursday that &apos; D &apos; notices were involved at all. The first time &apos; D &apos; noticeswere mentioned was when I rang him on the phone, and he said &quot;&apos; D &apos; noticesdo not apply&quot;, and the next time they were mentioned was when he pulledthem out of his pocket at the table.Q. That is not really what I asked you. I quite appreciate what he had said toyou on the Thursday, but even if he had not said that, you had views aboutthe true application of the 1956 and 1961 Notices? A. Based on past experience,yes.Q. Which made you have a very clear view from the first that they couldnot be invoked in this case? A. Yes, that is correct. But I would not liketo think there was strong argument about it. There was argument, but not onthe &apos; D&apos; notices, the argument was on the later matter of the request.Q. It was clearly your view that the &apos;D &apos; notice really had no application? A. Yes.Q. Would it not be natural, if that was your view, to wave them aside and say:I am afraid I cannot talk about that&quot;? A. I am afraid that did not occur.There was no question of my saying I could not talk about that; it was colonel lohan, who did not wave them aside but set them aside, Colonel Lohan took the action in doing this.Q. You are very experienced in all this business, as I know very well. A.Indeed.Q. And you have had, all through your professional career with the daily express, to read the &apos; D &apos; notices as they come up? A. Yes.Q. I gather that, in your view that the 1956 one definitely did not apply, youreally have two considerations in your mind: one is that you do not regard163
the alleged general collecting of cables for inspection, scrutiny, as being a secretmethod within the meaning of the letter of 1956? A. No, that is right, I do not.Q. That puzzles me, and I will tell you why: as I understand it, it has never been the subject of any public statement that this practice goes on, I think thatis why it was a big news point to you when this thing cropped up? A. Theonly reason it was a big news point, sir, was the routine collection. I have always been aware that cables were looked at, always been aware, and I cancite instances where it happened frequentiy during the war, or Admiral Thomsonhas mentioned some in his book, very important cases, and it has always beenobvious to me that in cases where people are under suspicion their cableswould be examined it is one of the first things one would do their cables andtheir letters.Q. But why is it not a secret method of intelligence, umt is what I cannotunderstand? A. The reason I have had this view is that as I say, after discuss-ing this matter with Admiral Thomson, and I think later with Colonel Lohan butcertainly with Admiral Thomson, over a long period of years, his view was thatthat &apos; D&apos; notice applied to methods which were secret in the sense that theRussians must not find out that they exist. I had an example, if I may give it toyou, because this is important: I found out long before it became public knowledge that the Russians had a device which you could just put anywhere,stick it under a table, and it would transmit a conversation, it did not evenneed a battery. I wanted to write about this and I argued with AdmiralThomson, I said: &quot; Look, this is a Russian thing, why can&apos;t I write about it? &quot;,and he said: &quot;The truth of the matter is that our own people are using this sort of apparatus, and that is a secret, and although the Russians have got itwe do not want them to know that we are using it as well&quot;. I thought that was reasonable. That was a secret device, but he always gave me to understand thatit did not cover things which were obvious, such as the opening of letters, thetapping of telephones, anything which would not appear novel or anything whichcould be easily thought of. It was a secret which you did not want theenemy to discover, not an operation that you were doing.Q. But there are many methods of secret intelligence, are there not, andthe most old-fashioned one of all is the opening of letters? A. Yes.Q. A practice that is well known? A. Yes.Q. There is the inspection of cables, which is not novel; there is the newerthing of telephone tapping? A. Yes.Q. There are the advanced scientific devices under which you can listen at great distance to something which is happening in a room? A. Yes.Q. There are visual aids of the most remarkable order? A. Yes.Q. Their existence is all known, there is no secret about bugging as a device?-A. No.Q. Why is one different from the other, when they are carried out by whatappears to be an intelligence service? A. I would argue now, sir, that theexistence of electronic methods is no longer a secret method, for example thisdevice I was telling you about, I was allowed to write about it once the americans discovered they had one in one of their embassies, and that is nosecret method but at that time it was considered to be a secret method. Andalthough I was allowed to write about telephone tapping and opening of letters,I was allowed to write about it only in general terms, and I was not allowed to write about those electronic things. And I think today, at this moment, &quot; secretintelligence methods &quot; refers to things we do not know about, just as we didnot know about the electronic devices, and that is the understanding I have always had, in a long grounding over the years and later from Colonel Lohan,and I think that is the colonel&apos;s view.Q. You see, if you just look at the three &apos; D&apos; notices. which matter, I wouldhave thought their story I quite understand what you are saying, that you did
not so interpret it, but I want to get at the general situation their story is fairlyplain. There is the one of April, 1956:&quot; Will you please in the national interest make no reference to thefollowing:(i) Secret intelligence or counter intelligence methods and activities in or outside the United Kingdom.&quot;and then there is the note which you draw attention to, a note to (i):&quot; Certain methods employed in Intelligence work are to some extent amatter of common knowledge and it is thus understandable that editorswould not normally regard them as secret methods.&quot;But that would apply, I would have thought, to virtually all these things, whichintelligence agencies resort to in order to obtain intelligence by secret activity. A. I think, sir, that refers to a secret device, to secret devices the nature ofwhich I do not know at the moment, and I gave you this electronics gadget asan example of one that would have been stopped under this particular &apos; D&apos;notice, because it was a secret method some years ago but now would followas a matter of common knowledge: there are books about it, you can buy thesebugs in the shops, but that is an example of one which was secret and now is not.Q. That would treat &quot; method &quot; as if it was just &quot; device &quot;. A. Well, if therewere some other secret method that was not obvious I think, on the appendixthere where it talks about &quot;... to some extent a matter of common knowledge and it is thus understandable that editors would not normally regard them assecret methods &quot;, cable examination is certainly one of them. It is mentionedin detail in the Official Secrets Act.Q. I will come to the Act; that is another of your points, I know. But whenit came to telephone tapping being made the subject of the White Paper, follow-ing the Birkett committee, it was after that that the letter of April 1956, the&apos; D &apos; notice that we have been talking about, was modified to the extent, as Ishould have read it, of releasing telephone tapping because its activity had beenmade public by the White Paper. Is that not what it says? A. I think that ispeculiar to telephone tapping, but as I have told you, I thought the reason it didnot mention for example opening of letters was because that was so pedestrianthat there would be no point in doing so, and I would,have thought looking atcables was the same. It could hardly be described as a very sensitive method,whereas the telephone tapping was something involving devices, interference inpeople&apos;s homes, gadgets being fixed. I always found in my experience that thesecurity authorities were always far more sensitive about telephone tapping than about letter opening, they did not like it being suggested that letters were openedbut they were not prepared to make much of a fuss, but they were very fussyindeed about this and went on being fussy until this business arose with I thinksome barrister or lawyer&apos;s case, and the telephone tapping Privy Councillors&apos;report, and it did not surprise me at all that there was a special thing abouttelephone tapping, but letters are not mentioned, are they?Q. No, but would you not read the October 1957 one as meaning that thegeneral Defence Notice of April 1956 is still in force about secret methods of intelligence, but that:&quot; In view of the Privy Council&apos;s report, you can no longer be asked tomaintain secrecy on the use of &apos; telephone tapping&apos; as one of the methodsemployed by the security service . . .&quot;that would leave all the other methods under the control of the original DefenceNotice, would it not?-No, because the appendix to that &apos; D &apos; notice says thateditors are only asked not to mention what may be regarded as obvious methodswhen there is a specific case in progress, and this I consider, as with letteropening, is a very obvious method, and there was no specific case involved.Q. But it is only so far as they are common knowledge. I am a little surprisedif you say that the scrutiny of all outgoing cables was a matter of commonknowledge. A. Of course it was not a matter of common knowledge, otherwise165
I would not have written the story. But what was a matter of common know-ledge I would still argue even a matter of common sense was that cable^could be examined and, in the case of a person under suspicion, just as letterswould be opened, so would their cables even more so be examined, especiallycables going out of the country. And this I would argue is a completely obviousmethod and therefore could not be called a secret method, although it isconducted in secrecy, and that is why I interpreted it in that way. And I thinkthat appendix to note (i) to that 1956 &apos; D &apos; notice is all-important in that respect.Q. The other point which I think you have dwelt upon in connection with thelunch, and certainly in other ways, is section 4 of the Official Secrets Act 1920,which shows that there does exist a power to issue warrants under the authorityof the Secretary of State? A. Yes.Q. But you would not for this purpose in your mind equate the fact thatthere exists such a power with the knowledge that there was a particular currentexercise on, would you? A. I would have thought, having read that, that that power would only be exercised before I knew about the story in connectionwith a specific case.Q. I follow that, but the mere fact that that power existed, which you thoughtprobably was only exercised in a specific case, would not mean that it was common knowledge or public knowledge that it was exercised generally withregard to all cables? A. Oh no, I never thought it was common knowledge that it was exercised with regard to all cables. The method of using it on occasions I would have thought was common knowledge, or as I say commonsense to intelligent people. But it would be obvious, if you thought about ways of checking on people&apos;s communications, you would say: &quot; I would open theirletters, I would tap their telephones, I would read their cables, if they sentany out&quot;. But the thing which I was concerned about was that what it seemedto show was that this thing which was introduced for specific purposes had become over the last few years a routine measure.Q. I quite follow that. -A. And that is what aroused my journalistic interest.Q. I am not for a moment saying it was not interesting. A. I fear, sir, I havenot answered your question?Q. Not quite. Really what I was asking you is this: people interested in thissubject would not know from reading section 4 of the Act, which showed therewas a power which could be exercised, to what extent that exercise at any onemoment was going on? A. Oh, certainly not.Q. What your story told them was the second, and they would not havededuced this from the first? A. What my story said was that it was going onall the time.Q. Yes. A. Yes, and I was prepared to admit that, as I did to Colonel Lohanin the restaurant when he said, &quot; We get some very interesting and valuable inform-ation out of this&quot;, which I think the Foreign Secretary also said yesterday.I said: &quot; I do not doubt it, but I think if it means that all cables, even the one  send to my auntie in Texas, are available for scrutiny, this is knowledge whichis being bought at too high a price in a free society &quot;. That is what I said. Itis a matter of opinion.; Q. Yes. Now on your reference to the 1961 &apos;D&apos; notice, which you sayColonel Lohan said was marginal I am not quite sure what that means, butat any rate it did not indicate a very strong reliance on it? A. That is right.Q. You said &quot; How can you pretend this is the interception of foreign com-munications &quot;, did you not? A. No, most certainly not. I think Colonel Lohansaid I said that, but I certainly did not. The only point I raised about that particular &apos; D &apos; notice was the question about &quot; on occasions &quot;, because I felt it was the same as the statement in the appendix to &apos; D&apos; notice 1956, that it only refers to instances where these things are being intercepted, these com-munications are being intercepted for a specific case or purpose on occasions.Q. Yes, &quot; The various methods used in the interception of foreign communica-tions for secret intelligence purposes &quot;. A. Yes, &quot; In this connection . . .&quot;
OQ. That is what you are asked not to talk about. A. What it says is: &quot; Inthis connection the Committee request that you will not refer to the fact thaton occasions it is necessary . . .&quot;, and by that I understood, as I understood from the previous one, that if there was a specific thing in progress, an occasionwhen this was being used, of course we would not refer to it, because this wouldbe damaging. But what I am certain of in my own mind, if I may put it thisway, is this, sir, that if the press members of the &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee had thought, when that was drafted, that this would cover the situation which I have written about, it is my view that they would never have agreed to it.Q.....Q. Yes, if you say that, I would follow you. A. Indeed, and there again Ibelieve there are secret things we do not know about and should not knowabout, and which should not be published.Q. Well, those are all the points, as I see it, about the luncheon interview,where your account and Colonel Lohan&apos;s account materially diverge. I thinkit is fairly common ground that at the end you left rather on this basis, thatyou were going to say: &quot; I will represent your arguments to my editor &quot;, because,although I am sure you had the position with your editor under which yourview about what can or cannot be published is very influential, it is ultimatelyhis decision? A. It is probably more than that in this case, because Mr. Marksis a previous defence correspondent himself, as it happens. Therefore he hasmore judgment than, say, the editor of the Daily Mail would have, who has not had that experience.Q. &quot; I will represent your arguments to my editor on the question of publica-tion.   My own view is that this is a case when we should publish &quot;? A. Yes.Q. &quot; And I believe you would say the same &quot; whether you said it laughinglyor not, I do not know. A. Well, we were not looking at it as a laughing matter at that stage, it was quite a serious moment.Q. After that I do not think there is any difference of substance as to whatpassed between you and him? A. No, it is only on timing of phone calls andso on.Q. And this question of the receipt? A. Yes.Q. We have got the receipts now. Here are the two receipts, Mr. Pincher.(Receipts passed to witness). A. It looks to me as though that number hasbeen changed.Chairman: It bears a red date stamp at the bottom left.Colonel Lohan: The red date stamp, my lord, may I say, was only put onwhen they were filed, it does not relate to the day they were received.Q. The &quot; 20th &quot; has a slight suggestion of inking over, though I do not knowanything which suggests there is any reason for it.Colonel Lohan: Am I allowed to say anything about that particular thing?Chairman: For the moment, Colonel, I think, you are listening. If necessaryyou can come forward later. Have you any further comment, Mr. Pincher? -A. I would suggest to you on that matter, sir, that it is rather obvious that onthe day the Prime Minister made his statement about a breach of two &apos; D&apos;notices, that would be the time when I would need to study the &apos; D&apos; notices indetail, and that would be the time I needed them, I did not need them on the20th.Q. When did you write the story, in your office on the Monday? A. Yes,after I left Colonel Lohan I went back to the office to write the story.Q. So you would have the &apos; D&apos; notices available to you there? A. Yes, butI did not need them because we had dispensed with these. But I did need them on the following day.Mr. Shinwell: Mr. Pincher, from Thursday 16th until Monday had you atany time any doubt in your mind whether you should write the story? A. Oh no.From Thursday until Monday on the Thursday night none, because I had got
confirmation of it and cleared it with Colonel Lohan completely, and we could have printed it that night if we had not been full of other material. On the1Friday of course because of my regular friendship with Colonel Lohan, themoment he came on the phone and he said, &quot; This is a security business &quot; Ihad doubts, and I promised him that we would do nothing about it until Monday,which was quite a long time to wait, so I must have had doubts.Q. You must have had doubts during that period. A. He put the doubts inmy mind.Q. You had doubts? A. Because he put them there. I had no doubt until he said, &quot; I must talk to you about it, it is a security business.&quot;Q. Did you have any discussion with anybody in spite of your doubts whether you should write the story? A. I never mentioned it to anybody, nobody at all,except this man, the news editor, who drifted in purely by accident to my roomshortly after I had talked to Colonel Lohan on the Friday when he said, &quot; Thisis a security business &quot;, and I said, &quot; I have been given a story and it might come to nothing because there is now a security matter involved and we will leave it until Monday&quot;, he was the only person.Q. Not a word with anybody about it?-A. Not as far as I remember. Iremember when I was dining with Dr. Eban asking him this question abouthow he would feel if cables were intercepted, but I cannot remember speakingabout the story as such to anybody, certainly nobody in the organisation.Q. When you first heard from this man Lawson, did you regard it as animportant story? A. I did not regard him as much of a source. I must tellyou I did not like him very much. No, I thought right away when he same tothe office that he had got on to something which was probably not a story. Inother words it was a specific operation. When he insisted, however, that it was going on all the time, of course, I had to make enquiries. If when I got the negative answer from the Ministry of Defence I had also got the same negativeanswer from the Post Office, that might well have been the end of it, but themoment I got the positive answer from the Post Office, then I was in a pro-fessional position of having some information which I had to go on and develop.Q. You had no conversation with anybody, apart from the news editor, onFriday about the matter? A. I made enquiries about it, but inside theorganisation.Q. Yes. A. No, nothing about it at all, not at all.Q. Was this customary when you were about to write an article not to speak to someone? A. It is standard practice, and I will explain why. First of all,the editor cannot be involved in stories which are what I might call embryonicbecause so many of them do not come to anything. I have learned from bitterexperience that one is very unpopular if one gets a news editor, excited about a story in the morning, and they begin to build up their whole ideas, and suddenlyat six o&apos;clock you say, &quot;I am sorry, the story has collapsed &quot; or &quot; We are not going to be allowed to print it&quot; so I am left on my own, and what I do isI work the story up, and when it is at a stage when I am ready to write it orI know I will be, I go to the news editor, show it to the news editor, and say&quot; I have this, and we can have it tonight&quot;. That did not arise on this story,because Colonel Lohan had told me that there was a security business involved,and I thought it might well die on the Monday. I told the news editor there isno point in raising this with Mr. Marks on Friday. I would not have told him at all if he had not drifted into my room. Then on Monday when I heard form colonel Lohan, the story was in my opinion a runner, because not only had wegot over the question of the security angle, apart from personal requests, buthe had also confirmed a great deal of the accuracy of it in the course of our conversations.Q. You kept the story in your head for several days, you had no conversa-tion with anybody in the organisation that day, and suddenly on Monday after-noon you wrote it because you thought it was a runner. What do you meanby a runner? A. It was a runner because as a result of the lunch I felt that
there were no security objections to it beyond the situation that the editor had to resolve, and he had nothing to resolve until I wrote it.Q. There is some conflict of evidence about what happened at lunch onMonday. A.. Yes.Q. How long did this lunch last? A. I would have thought I know it beganat five past one I suppose it lasted until about a quarter to three.Q. That is a long time for lunch, it it not? A. I usually take that time.Q. You had quite a good lunch? A. Reasonable.Q. Quite a long conversation? A. A long conversation.Q. Did you drink much during the period? A. I had a glass of white wine to begin with, and the colonel had a small dry Martini, and we shared a bottle ofred wine between us, and that was the sum total of the lunch drinks.Q. You have a clear recollection of what happened? A. Indeed.Q. Are you surprised that Colonel Lohan has no clear recollection of what happened? A. I am surprised that his recollection differs from mine.Q. Colonel Lohan is a friend of yours, you say? A. Yes, that is right, verymuch.Q. You have known him for many years? A. Fifteen years.Q. You lunch with him regularly once a month, so you said, and you trusthim, you said? A. Yes.  We have trusted each other for many year?.Q. When he came to you never mind about the &apos; D&apos; notices and suggestedthis was a matter of security, and requested you on more than one occasion duringthe period not to write this story, and he did not want it published for various reasons, though you trusted him you decided to go ahead? A. Yes, that is right.Q. Was this the first time you were in conflict with Colonel Lohan?-A. Wehave often had arguments, but I think there has never been anything quite like this before, never ever in our long co-operation have we had this divergence ofview, but I must point out to you that always where Colonel Lohan comes tome with this sort of request that it is not his request, and he has been askedto put it by some Government department. We have had instances where rulingshave been put through the Chairman of the &apos;D&apos;-notices Committee for somepurpose which I consider not to be a real matter, a genuine matter of security,and where the public interest has in my view been infringed. So because eventhough we are great friends he comes to me and says, &quot; I do not think you should print this &quot;, that is not a complete ruling.  I want to know exactly why.Q. Can you recall an incident when you were in conflict with him about whether you should proceed with a story in the last two years or thereabouts? A. Theremust have been so many. There are many occasions when I have rung aboutwhether it was possible to print something about a weapon and he has said,&quot; No &quot;, and I have said &quot; This has been written in the American papers &quot; andhe has said, &quot; It is still covered by &apos; D&apos; notices &quot;, and we have agreed, and Ihave dropped it.Q. Were you satisfied that these particular instances were always covered by&apos; D &apos; notices on requests that you should not publish? A. There is usually, sir,in this relationship a good deal of give and take, and I have been prepared in thepast to help him by stifling something, knowing that in future he would helpme by making perhaps something a little easier than he could have made it,and one has to play this by ear as each one comes along.Q. Then out of your vast experience, which we all recognise, and knowledgeof these matters, would you say that this matter of transit of cables from one place to another and your suspicions about vetting was more important than a story about weapons? A. What really was the nub of the thing as far as Iwas concerned was the public interest here, and I think probably in the instancesI have been thinking about, specific weapons, the public interest has not been involved in the same manner, and it does not affect the public interest if some-thing is going on about weapons unless there is some scandal attached to it,
and it is really a matter for the Services, and if we print a story of that natureit is of limited interest. But I think this was of maximal interest, and that is why I said, &quot; If you asked anybody in this restaurant whether they thought itwas the right thing that these cables should be made available not one would agree with you &quot; and he said, &quot; I admit that, but nevertheless we get some very interesting information out of it.&quot;Q. Now about this man Lawson who came to you with information abouttransit of cables, do you know what was his motive at all? A. I had neverheard of him before. While I was away a few days previously he had rungmy secretary and made this appointment. I had been away and he made thisappointment, but I had never heard of him, and I did not know who he was from Adam. When he came in he looked rather scruffy to me, but he established the fact that he was a student, and that he had this information. I could seeby the way he talked one gets a flair for this I tried to get him on to tech-nicalities because he was a telegraphist, and I saw that he knew what he wastalking about, and that he had not made it up. But the moment I had his information and confirmed it he was no longer a part of the thing, and I have only ever seen him once again.Q. You gathered he was concerned about the public interest? A. This is what he said.   He did not ask for money, and I was rather surprised.Q. You were also concerned about the public interest?-A. Yes.Q. And you were concerned about an invasion of privacy?-A. That is right.Q. When Lawson spoke to you did he indicate that his privacy had beeninvaded? A. No, he did not mention that at all, but was concerned about this story that appeared on television about this man who had been sent to inter-cept letters from some organisation, and he did not say he belonged to this organisation. In fact I have forgotten what it was, but there was quite a bitin the newspapers at the time.Q. There has been some suggestion that industrial firms like LCI. might have their cables vetted, and this would be detrimental to their trading and to com-mercial interests. A. That was his suggestion.Q. Whose? A. Lawson&apos;s.Q. It was his? A. Yes.Q. He is not a business man, is he?-No, he is not a business man, but hada great deal to do with the transmission of commercial cables, and the companyhe worked for was Commercial Cables Limited, and they transmitted a great number. And the sort of stuff that he had to transmit on occasions could havebeen of enormous interest. He said, too, I think he said, the Board of Trade,for example, if some merger had been going on the Government should nothave known about it. He seemed more reasonable than I thought he was going to be when he came in, and he was quite an intelligent fellow.Q. And he persuaded you there was a case? A. No, he did not. What hepersuaded me was that it was worth while finding out whether his story was true, and if I had not had confirmation from Mr. 0&apos;Brien I can tell you and Imean this I almost certainly would not have gone on with it, because I had a lot of things that came in, and I was busy with the White Paper. It was late at night,and if I had got confirmation I would have dropped it. The Mail did,because they could not get confirmation.Q. When you confirmed the story, as you say, were you concerned withinvasion of privacy? A. Yes, the moment I realised that this was a general thingI felt it was wrong.Q. Was your privacy invaded at any time? A. My privacy has often beeninvaded.Q. By this particular thing. A. No, as far as I am aware. It has beeninvaded on the telephone.Q. I am not speaking about telephones. That does not arise. This is some-thing quite different. A. I am sorry.
Sir Peter Rawlinson: The question that was directed by the committee to myclient was whether his privacy had ever been at all invaded.-A. I thought youmeant in any way. I am sorry.Mr. Shinwell: I will put the question in a direct form. Out of this particularincident, did you feel your privacy was invaded? A. No, I must say I do notsend many cables.Q. That was not a motive? A. No, there was no personal motive. It was justanother story as far as I was concerned.Q. That was not the motivation. What was the motivation? A. The motiv-ation was that I am paid by the Daily Express to bring news in and write, and here was what looked to me a pretty hot piece of news, if true. It wasnew to me that there was a routine collection of cables going on, and that wasthe only motivation.Q. Although it was hot news, and you thought it ought to be written up, youthought it invaded the privacy of industrial firms on the basis of what Lawsonsaid to you, that privacy had been invaded, yet in spite of Colonel Lohan, whowas a friend of yours for a long period of time, and his frequent requests to younot to proceed on grounds of security, if not because it was related to &apos; D &apos;notices, you proceeded to write the story? A. I would have written it anywaybecause I have to show it to the editor.Q. What do you mean you would have written it anyway? A. There arethings that must happen in this sort of business. First of all the informationmust come in, and then it must be put down on paper in a form which could,if the editor so decided, be printed, and that is what I mean by writing a story.As I explained, it was not a case I could suppress of my own volition, becausethe Mail and other newspapers were involved, and therefore I had to write theinformation and show it to the editor before he could make his decision. Itwas a bit of machinery as far as that is concerned. When we get to the stage ofthe story, I have to write it and say, &quot;There it is, and Colonel Lohan has said, &apos; Please do not print it&apos;, but those are the facts, and on those facts hebases his decision &quot;, but I must go through the motions of writing it, otherwisehe has nothing to look at and argue with himself.Q. This incident relates to the transit of cables and your suspicions onvetting? A. Yes.Q. Would you consider that the transit of cables and vetting of cables is nota matter of security? A. I was in no doubt that it was a matter of security,because Colonel Lohan had said, &quot; We find out some very interesting thingsfrom this and very valuable information&quot; and I knew it was a matter of security. I felt the security authorities in this instance were going beyond whatwas reasonable in a free society.Q. You were convinced apart from what Colonel Lohan said that this incident was related to security? A. Oh yes. I had no doubt it was a securitybusiness.Q. You thought it was wise to publish it? A. I thought it was my own view was I must write it, and if asked my advice, which I was, I felt that it was wrong that this thing should go on and not be known.Q. I think you said in connection with some other incident that the Russiansmight be interested in what was happening. May I ask you this question? Isit desirable that the Russians should be aware that cables are in transit andare vetted? What is your view about that? A. My real view is that they are fully aware of it already. If you ask me that question, which is the first time it has been put to me, I would answer that they are well aware that cables arevetted, otherwise I do not think we should have ever had any sort of noticesuggesting even on occasions we should not mention it, and I think professionalspies are fully aware of what might happen to their communications unless they take very great care.Q. Would you go so far as to say that because of their knowledge of what is happening, espionage operations and exercises, even &apos; D &apos; notices are of very
little value? A. I think &apos; D&apos; notices myself are of the greatest value, and Iwould defend the system to the death. I am all in favour of the &apos; D &apos; notice system, utterly.Q. In spite of what the Russians may know, or any potential enemy may know,of what is happening in this way? A. On matters of technical fact, such asweapons, it is possible to keep secrets, but what I consider to be obvious methods,such as vetting of cables by any Government, whether Russian or here, I wouldhave thought every Government knows that its cables in and out of a foreign country would be looked at by the agents of that country.Q. You said what concerns you is that there was no valid &apos; D &apos; notice relatingto this affair? A. That I consider that there is no valid &apos; D&apos; notice.Q. That is your case? A. Yes, I consider there is no valid &apos; D &apos; notice, but themain case I have been making, I hope, was that it was agreed by Colonel Lohanthat no valid &apos; D &apos; notice applied.Q. Then can you explain to us his lordship did ask you a question, but i could not be satisfied about the answer on the Monday when you had thislunch and Colonel Lohan came along and produced two &apos; D&apos; notices, whatmade him do that? He knew he was going to meet you. He knew about the story and that you contemplated writing this story, and he had had discussionsinside, and all the rest of it. According to several statements he was underpressure. He came with &apos; D &apos; notices. Why should he have come with &apos; D&apos;notices if he had not in his mind the &apos; D &apos; notices were in some form related to your proposed story? A. I think it is a very reasonable question, but I think the answer is this, that Colonel Lohan had already told me categorically thatthey did not apply. He then had great pressure brought to bear on him duringthe previous 48 hours by the security authorities and other Government agenciesto change his mind, and Colonel Lohan felt, and I still think he feels, this wouldbe a dishonest thing to do, because he still believed they did not apply. Theburden of the talk at the table about &apos; D&apos; notices was really meant to show methat he was right about this. He had told me that they did not apply, and thatthe first one could not apply at all, and this was in support of his original state-ment, and as for this one he said this was so marginal that you can . . .Q. I did ask you in an interjection, which his lordship allowed me to put,about other occasions when incidents were suppressed, or you refrained ratherfrom writing a story about them, and I asked how many had occurred in the lasttwo and a half years, and you mentioned one, the Bossard case. A. I mentioned the Bossard case. I mentioned the case about the Director of Security Services,and I could think of more by looking through my cuttings book, because thatwould bring them back to my mind, but I have so many instances where I haveto talk to him on &apos; D &apos; notices as to whether it is all right, and I have alwaysmade a point of never writing any story in the Daily Express, even if I felt it did not infringe, without ringing up and saying, &quot; What is your view? &quot;. Ialways ring Colonel Lohan when writing anything affecting any security ordefence story, and that is why we have so many calls.Q. What you say in reply to my question is that quite frequently incidentsoccurred on which you refrained from writing the story?-A. Yes, I thinkColonel Lohan would agree with that.Q. How would you compare those incidents with this particular incident, the gravity of it? A. I am still of the opinion that we should have printed this story.Q. What about the other stories? A. I am of the opinion that the Colonelwas very often right, that it was a good thing not to print the fact that we have this machine or that machine, or whatever it may be, and there are other instanceswhen I think I was sold a pup by the Colonel and he thought he had got me thattime, but it was worth it, and we have often laughed about it, and the same withthe Admiral in the past. He has very often asked me to do something andthen joked about it, and then suggested we were rather mugs, but a lot of pressure was put on him.
Q. You mean by &quot; sold a pup&quot; that he got the better of you? A. Yes.They did not really have a good case. I can give you a good example and itdoes not refer to him. It was some years ago when they were putting up atomicreactors at wind scale and I found out that they had built them wrongly. these buildings are colossal and two of the charge face walls were so porous they wouldhave to be pulled down, or repaired. I thought this was a jolly good story.They were not working, and there was no question of anything about nuclearexplosives, but we were talked out of it by the Admiral, and afterwards whenthe whole thing had been repaired he said &quot; You can run it. If you hadrun it then nothing could have been done &quot;. But he had threatened under theOfficial Secrets Act.Q. You did not write it? -A. Not until they were working, which was about18 months later when they had done all the repairs, and it was a rather poorstory then to what it would have been.Q. That story in your view, in retrospect, would not have been of very muchadvantage to, say, the Russians? A. No, and the Admiral agreed, and it was rather, &quot; Well, we got you that time &quot; and I think the story of the MI 6 traineeswould not have done any harm.Q. It would not have mattered to the Russians? A. They were not concernedwith the Russians, but that makes us look stupid in front of the Americans.Q. The knowledge that a potential enemy possesses about the transit of cablesand the vetting of cables, might it not lead to an alteration in codes? A. I think the codes are altered very regularly in any case. I agree with you. If thereis a specific thing going on we would never dream of printing that story, andif the police simply say, &quot; We do not want you to write anything about this &quot;,even if we know there is a great story, because an arrest is imminent, we donot write it, and there is a great deal of giving in by the press on this. This isthe first instance I can remember of any major size where we have not agreedentirely.Q. You have had doubts in the past, and you refrained from taking action? A. Yes.Q. And on this particular occasion although you had some doubts, and you were frequently requested by your intimate friend. Colonel Lohan, not to go ahead, and up to that time you had not consulted your editor because youdid not think it necessary or customary, but you decided to go ahead? A. Yes, that is right, and I printed the story.Q. You did that solely and exclusively in the public interest? A. I didit, to be absolutely honest, in two interests. I regarded myself as professionallyin possession of some evidence, of some information which would make a goodnewspaper story, any newspaper, not just the Daily ^Express, but I happen towork for them, and it was my duty to write the story. In addition I felt it wasin the public interest if it was printed, but that was a decision made by the editor. The reason I wrote the story, to be honest, was it was my professionalduty to do it, and that is what I am paid to do.Q. You said in your deposition, page 8, that &quot; editors are sometimes asked toavoid mentioning non-secret methods when specially requested in cases whereparticular persons are under surveillance.&quot;   You said that. A. Yes.Q. So it sometimes happens, even apart from &apos; D&apos; notices, you refrain from taking action? A. Where anybody is under surveillance we would always do that,and it would be irresponsible for any paper to print a story about cable vettingor anything else if it referred, and we were told, to a case in progress. Itwould be monstrous, I would have thought criminal.Mr. Sehvyn Lloyd: Going back to the beginning of the story, Wing CommanderHarris told us yesterday that he had an enquiry on the telephone from you?-A. Yes.Q. You said you had heard cables were being collected from some cableoffices in London by a van? A. Yes.
Q. And Commander Harris says he thinks you said, he is not positive, by aMinistry . . . A. Works.Q. ... of Public Building and Works vans? A. Yes.O. And taken to a Ministry of Defence building where they were kept for aperiod, and I think he said, Commander Harris thinks you said for 48 hours and afterwards delivered to cable offices. A. That is right.Q. Did you say the same thing to Colonel Lohan? A. I said exactly thesame thing to him, and I would point out that I had rung Wing CommanderHarris and I did that at about three, and I did not ring Colonel Lohan until later in the afternoon. Colonel Lohan also said he asked me to ring theMinistry of Defence. His memory is wrong. I told him I had rung wing commander Harris at the Ministry of Defence already, because we had a joke,and he said, &quot; You would not get much out of him &quot; and I said No.Q. You rang Wing Commander Harris first? A. Yes.Q. You did say you pointed out the APPendix to the &apos; D&apos; notice of 1956 and you referred to the Note to (i) about &quot; Certain methods employed in Intelligencework are to some extent a matter of common knowledge . . .&quot; A. Yes.Q. And I understand your suggestion is it was common knowledge that cableswere intercepted? A. No, knowledge that cables could be intercepted.Q. You referred to Admiral Thomson&apos;s book. When was that published? A. That was published &quot; Blue Pencil Admiral&quot; it was published I should think about ten years ago, some little time before he died, in which he referredto a story in which some American correspondents had sent something out ofthe country, and it was during the war when they should not have done, and how the security authorities here got all the cables and went through them andtried to piece them together, and yet failed to produce the message, which wassimple, because all you had to do was to take the last word of each message,and it gave away the fact that the Cruiser Belfast had been damaged.Chairman: But Admiral Thomson&apos;s reminiscences about wartime affairs and practices would not have much bearing on peace-time. A. What it had a bearing on was that the use of looking at cables was a fairly common andobvious business.Q. In wartime. A. I would have thought in peacetime, because espionage,a certain amount of it, is going on in peace.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Are there any other examples of that sort of thing inyour mind about interception of communications? A. Specifically about cables?Q. Yes. A. I cannot think of any other instances comparable to that, but Istill do think that if we get hold of one or two James Bond novels we will findexamination of cables has been a common method of seeing whether spies are sending information out of the country.Q. Mr. 0&apos;Brien said it was something perfectly well known. A. He agreed with me. I think what he was trying to say he did not do it very clearly wasthat in his opinion this was an obvious thing, that cables would be looked at on occasions.Q. The paragraph went on to refer in this notice to secret intelligence orcounter intelligence methods.  Yes.Q. And the Appendix talks about methods, and then nobody has yet discussedany of the following words &quot;... and activities &quot;. A. Yes.Q. Would you regard it as a secret activity? A. No, I would regard it as an activity carried out in secret, I think so, because I have also gone into this withthe Admiral and he said that referred to our agents, what they are doing, wherethey are. We have had instances of this, which I should mention in view ofMr. ShinwelFs earlier statement. We have had instances where we have foundout a watch has been kept on a certain house, and there has been some reason why it would have made a story. I have got on to the Admiral, and I have said, &quot;There is a watch on a house, somebody has been seen with a telescopein another house opposite &quot;, and he has said, &quot; For God&apos;s sake don&apos;t mention that,
because this is some of the boys at work &quot;. This would be a secret activity.I would agree that to some extent the actual removal of the vans with thebags is a secret activity, and therefore that should not be looked into. I am sure the Daily Express was not involved in any photographing of any vans,because I thought that would be wrong, because that could lead to identificationof vans and places and people. What I was concerned about was to writeabout the general practice, not how, where they are taken, and what time, andso on, and that I think is the activity, the collection. We did not intrude into that at all.Q. Your contention is the routine collection is neither a secret method norsecret activity? A. That is right.Q. If you had started writing about what was done with the material after-wards. . . . A. All I could do was to say that they are available and theywould be available for security vetting, and I would agree with you if we went into what happened in detail, that would be a secret method, and it would alsobe covered I should imagine by the Official Secrets Act.Re-examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. On this last matter the 1957 one I think dealt with the interception of telegrams, did it not? A. Which was this?Q. The Birkett Report issued by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office in 1957. A. What page?Q. Let us look first of all at page 13, paragraph 37, which deals there withtheir view about the law:  &quot; As telegrams are postal packets for the purposes of the Post Office act of 1953 ... it is an offence for an officer of the Post Office to &apos; open,delay or detain&apos; a telegram in course of transmission by post unless itis his duty so to do, or the opening, &amp;c, is authorised by the warrant ofthe Secretary of State, or it is justified on one or other of the groundsmentioned in section 58(1) . . .&quot;They deal with letters, the law on letters and telegrams, and if you look overthe page at page 14 it refers there to what happened in 1937:  &quot;... that it was undesirable that records of telephone conversations should be made by Post Office servants and disclosed to the Police or tothe Security Service without the authority of the Secretary of State. Apartfrom thinking that the former practice was undesirable, the Home office was of opinion that the power on which they had acted to intercept letters and telegrams on the authority of a warrant issued by the Secretary ofState, was wide enough in its nature to include the interception of telepnonemessages also.&quot;It goes on referring there to &quot; the authority which had already been recognised in the statutes to which we have referred dealing with letters and telegrams.&quot;Then it sums it up on page 15, paragraph 51, the state of the law:  &quot; It is difficult to resist the view that if there is a lawful power to interceptcommunications in the form of letters and telegrams, then it is wide enoughto cover telephone communications as well.&quot;-A. Yes.Q. And again on page 29 it deals with the interception of communications:  &quot; There is no doubt that the interception of communications, whether bythe opening or reading of letters or telegrams, or by listening to and record-ing telephone conversations, is regarded with general disfavour.&quot;It is right, is it not, that at any rate in 1957 there was a Privy Council Reportthat did deal to a certain extent with intercepting telegrams? A. Yes.Q. And therefore the fact that telegrams were intercepted and I am notsaying how often or how regularly or how rarely the fact that telegrams were intercepted, do you think that was in your view to some extent a matter ofcommon knowledge?   To some extent a matter of common knowledge that
there were interceptions of telegrams while there were interceptions of telephonesor interceptions of letters? A. I have always thought this was the case, that,this was a matter of common knowledge, even apart from this report.Q. What was really the key part of your story I think it is clear is the routine . . -A. Yes, and this is made clear in the story as I wrote it.Q. You said Colonel Lohan can be on occasions put under pressure, pressure by the security people by others as well but by the security people? A.Colonel Lohan is employed by the Ministry of Defence. He is an impartialman, and as impartial as he can be, but he is available at all times to theMinistry of Defence, or to the Security Services, or to any other Governmentdepartment that is interested in security matters. Therefore obviously he canbe called to the presence, usually and very often, of high level people, and therehave been instances in which I have been involved in which great political pressure has been put on him in the past.Q. I want to get it clear, because there have been put to you certain questions that by publishing or writing this story you were doing something deliberatelyto harm the State. A. Certainly not.Q. You have been asked about drink at a meal. I have not asked any otherwitness. Have you any confusion over the state of that lunch that you had atthe L&apos;Ecu de France? A. Certainly I think four glasses of wine over two hours would not confuse anybody.Q. It has not been asked of any other witness, what have they been drinking. A. I have no objection.Q. Is the question of the difference between you anything to do with theentertainment that you had? A. Certainly not.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I did put in through Mr. Pincher his record, my lord,of when he sent for the &apos; D &apos; notices.Chairman: I have lost interest in this particular point, but it is in, is it? Wecan look at it, the record of messages.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I am interested to know what the committee are par-ticularly interested in. If there is a clash, if this is important, this part of courseof the case, as it were, for the persons who have been complained of, therewas plenty of opportunity after 6.30 for Colonel Lohan to have been in touchwith the Express, and he says he was in touch, and the Express says he was not intouch, and it might go to some issue as to whether or not, on the position ofthe editor, Colonel Lohan not having been in contact with him, and if it isirrelevant . . .Chairman: I do not think it really is going to help us one way or the other.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I am going to have on record that,there is a record thata man called Smallman went to Colonel Lohan&apos;s office on 21st February, andit is in the Daily Express records, at 4.40, and it has been produced, a receipt,with this man&apos;s signature on it, in which I suggest the date of it has been changed, and there has been a receipt produced of a record of a man called Floydwho is also said in our records to be going to Shell Mex House and therereceiving these &apos; D &apos; notices.Chairman: The second one is the 22nd, is it?Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes.Chairman: You say that appears to have an alteration on it?Sir Peter Rawlinson: That is right.   The first one is Smallman.   Clearly bothhave been altered, and the purpose of it I do not know.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: It could have been a mistake.  Sometimes people do makemistakes about them.Colonel Lohan: I will talk about this when I am allowed to.(The witness withdrew).176
Mr. D. Marks called examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. Are you Derek Marks, the editor of the Daily Express! A. Yes.Q. How long have you been that, and what senior posts have you held atthe Daily Express . . .  A. I have been editor since July, 1965, and immediately before that I was for about two years the deputy at the Evening Standard, before that for a year the Managing Editor of the Daily Express, and before that for about four years the deputy editor of the Evening Standard.Q. Have you ever served as defence correspondent of the Daily Express! A. Yes, from about 1952 to 1958. I was the chief political and diplomaticcorrespondent, and took in a large slice of defence, which I had also done before with the Yorkshire Post.Q. You covered defence work in your experience on the Yorkshire Post.Did you see Mr. Chapman Pincher on Monday, 20th February? A. Yes, he came to my office.Q. At what time was that? A. A quarter to six.Q. Did he tell you about the story that this committee is enquiring into? A. Yes.Q. Had you heard anything about that story before 5.45 on Monday, 20thFebruary? A. Not a word.Q. He has told us he came to your office to tell you a stoiy about cable vetting, and that he had been tipped off by Lawson I think this seems to beunchallenged who had worked for Commercial Union, and Lawson had firstgone to the Mail. A. Correct.Q. Who had put a girl reporter and photographer on the story? A. Yes.Q. And Colonel Lohan had been able to persuade the managing editor of the daily Mail to drop the whole enquiry? A. Yes.Q. He had gone to the Manchester Evening News. A. Yes.Q. Who had really told him, Lawson, to come to Mr. Pincher. A. Correct.Q. Did Mr. Pincher say anything about having telephoned Colonel Lohan? A. Yes, he said that immediately after he had seen Lawson he had telephonedColonel Lohan, and asked him if there was any question of such a story beingcovered by the &apos; D &apos; notice.Q. Did he said what the answer was? A. The answer was a categoric no.Q. That is what Mr. Chapman Pincher told you? A. That is what chapman pincher told me, yes.Q. Did he say he had spoken at all again to Colonel Lohan? A. Yes, hesaid he had a number of conversations and he had wound up with having lunchwith him that day, the Monday.Q. Did he say anything more about&apos; D &apos; notices? A. Yes, he said that colonel lohan had brought all the relevant &apos; D &apos; notices along with him and had pointedand said &quot; None of them apply &quot;, and there was some discussion which wenton. The situation was similar to that on telephone tapping in that where ithad been established that individual instances of tapping must not be referredto it was perfectly permissible to write about the practice as a whole.Q. Did he say anything about Colonel Lohan being under any pressure at all? A. Yes, what he said was that Colonel Lohan had said that while he agreedthere was no &apos; D&apos; notice on the story he was under very strong pressure to persuade us not to use the story.Q. Did you form any view then when he told you this about pressure? A. My immediate assumption was that it would be political pressure, becauseobviously the vetting story would have political implications, and there had beena fairly hefty row about telephone tapping, particularly the alleged tapping ofLabour MJPs when the party was in opposition.
Q. What did you say when he told you all this? A. I asked to see the writtenstory so that it could be considered, and Chapman Pincher again reiterated thathe had undertaken to Colonel Lohan that he would represent to me the ColoneFsviews that the story should not be published.Q. Did he say what he had said to Lohan about whether he thought you would agree to that? A. Yes, Mr. Pincher said he told the Colonel he did not think there was much chance of his view, that is the Colonels view, being accepted,since neither the &apos; D &apos; notice nor the Official Secrets Act applied, but none the-less he would put the view to me.Q. Then did you have a conference, or did you call in Mr. Raybould, Mr.Johnson and I think Mr. Andrew Edwards? A. Yes, I called them all into myoffice so that we could all read the finished story through.Q. Was anything more said about &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Yes, I specifically asked mr. Pincher whether &apos; D &apos; notices applied and I again received from him the specific assurance that Colonel Lohan had agreed there was no question of &apos; D &apos;notices applying, although it was obvious the government did not want us to print it.Q. Was there some talk about the Official Secrets Act, and did the legalmanager . . . A. The legal manager had the Official Secrets Act with him and, as you know, section 4 sets out the power of the government to inspect cables,and I suggested it would be a good thing to include a reference to the section in the story.Q. Was that put in the story, the section 4, and then did you come to a decision? A. Yes indeed; yes, I came to a decision.Q. What did you understand was your position in the face of Chapman Pincherhaving said Colonel Lohan had said categorically that &apos; D &apos; notices did not applybut had requested you not to publish? What did you think your right or position was under the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure? A. First of all, as far as the &apos; D &apos; noticeprocedure was concerned, they were not covered by &apos; D&apos; notice. On that I hadthe categoric assurance. Secondly, the powers to inspect cables, public property,as enshrined in the Official Secrets Act. The third and really most decisivepoint in this was that, despite the pressure Mr. Pincher reported the Colonelhad applied, the story had been first put to the secretary as early as Thursday.We knew it was in the possession also of the Daily Mail. Now, if it had been an exclusive story to us and there was real feeling that it should not be pub-lished, then in the ordinary course of events I would have expected privaterepresentations to be made to me. If, however, there are two newspapers on tothe story, or more in this case we knew it was not only ourselves and theMail in London but the Manchester Evening News in Manchester then it wouldbe quite proper, since there was no question of exclusivity involved, for theDefence Notice secretary to put out an overriding caveat to all papers warningthem off the story.Chairman: Do you mean, Mr. Marks, having obtained the agreement of therepresentatives of the press? A. I think they would be obliged to obtain theagreement of two press representatives.Q. To get around on the Friday? A. On the Friday or the Thursday, sir.Q. You said if you had got a &apos; D &apos; notice specifically covering this point,under that authority you would not have felt you were being ill-treated by thePress and Broadcasting Committee? A. I would not have felt ill-treated in the sense of any exclusivity of the story because the story had no exclusivity. I wouldhave felt very angry I think because I do not think this is a proper matter fora &apos; D &apos; notice.Q. I was assuming the press representatives on the committee had got to agreethat it was covered by special notice, and I would have thought it was your jobto observe it. A. I should have to observe it until such time as I got it lifted.Q. If it had been exclusive to you? A. Then I would have expected per-sonal representation to be made to me.
Q. Supposing it had not been and you had got a notice from the committee,would you have ignored it or would you have sent in a protest to the committeelater? A. I am sorry, I am not with you.Q. Supposing you had got a special &apos; D &apos; notice on Thursday or Friday, whichwould have meant there had been at any rate a sufficient number of pressrepresentatives to agree to it, and the story was exclusive to you, would you have felt that was an improper use of the &apos; D &apos; notices? A. I should have thoughthave felt that was an improper use of the &apos; D&apos; notices? A. I should have feltthat, yes. I would have thought he would have sent me a private letter. Hemay then have subsequently reinforced that up if he felt so strongly about it;he might have had to. I think it would have been a somewhat dangerous move,taking it from the point of view of future relations.Q. But if he had sent you a private letter about your private story, that wouldnot have come with the sanction of any press representatives? A. No.Q. Would it not have had less weight for that reason? A. It would have hadless weight, but obviously I would have to listen. I listened very carefully andweighed up what Mr. Pincher had to say about Colonel Lohan&apos;s views, but I wouldhave done nothing certainly had I received a private letter without seeing colonel lohan myself and arguing the matter with him.Q. What did Mr. Pincher convey to you as the reasons which led colonel lohan to put in this request to you? A. He said that Colonel Lohan wasunder great pressure to get us not to use the story, that the government didnot want us to use it for security reasons, but that the &apos; D &apos; notices did not applyThat I think is the lot.Q. &quot; Security reasons &quot; being the phrase used, was it? A. &quot; Security reasons &quot;being the phrase used.Q. That may cover a great deal? A. Indeed, Sir.Sir Peter Rawlinson: That being so, you made the decision? A. Yes.Q. Before you made that decision did you receive any warning from anybodyat all other than Mr. Chapman Pincher reporting Colonel Lohan? A. Let usget it straight. Chapman Pincher in no sense gave a warning. Pincher gave an assurance that there was no application of &apos; D&apos; notices and coupled with that a firm, strong request from Colonel Lohan that nonetheless we should not use the story.Q. Now until what time did you remain in your office that evening? A. Asfar as I can recall I left the office at about ten past seven ; I know I was lateanyway.Q. And you went over to change because there was a dinner for Trevor Evans atthe Garrick club? A. Yes.Q. Was Sir Max Aitken going to be at that dinner? A. He was.Q. Did you see Sir Max Aitken before you arrived at the dinner? A. before i arrived at the dinner, no. I was late arriving, he was a few seconds later than   was, and we said good evening and that was it.Q. Did you ever speak to him before a certain telephone call about theChapman Pincher story that evening? A. No.Q. Had you left any message where you were and what time you would beback at the office? A. Yes, I had left a message since my deputy and I were going to the dinner.Q. Mr. Raybould? A. Mr. Raybould was going to the dinner as well.Mr. Johnson, the night editor was in charge, and I told him I would make every endeavour to be back in the office by 10 o&apos;clock.Q. Did you at some time speak to Sir Max Aitken? A. Yes, as near as Ican place it it was about 10.15. The speeches went on rather longer than hadbeen anticipated and Sir Max, who was sitting further down from me on the left-hand side where I could not see him, suddenly appeared round by me and said he had been out to take a telephone call from the Foreign Secretary. He didnot understand what it was about, but the Foreign Secretary had said something to the effect that we were running a story in Glasgow which was under &apos; D &apos; notice,
would we take it out, and Sir Max replied, &quot; I told him you [that is me] werehere with me, that I would speak to you about it and certainly if it wasunder &apos; D &apos; notice we would take it out.&quot; The Foreign Secretary added some-thing to the effect that if we did not use it that night we would have a betterstory the following day.Q. Was there any question of Sir Max knowing anything about the cable vetting story?-A. Sir Max knew nothing about the story until I came back from making a telephone call about a quarter of an hour later.Q. What did you do when Sir Max said this to you? A. I went up as soonas I could and telephoned via our office switchboard direct on a tie-line through toour Glasgow office. I got through to the editor there and asked him if he was runnin, that is if his paper was printing. I said, &quot; Have you got any Polarisstory or anything like that that could possibly be under &apos; D &apos; notice? &quot; He saidno, he had not, his front page was virtually the same as mine in London. I should explain that we print different editions in Manchester and Glasgow and thereare local variations which we would not necessarily know about in London.Chairman: You transmit to Manchester and Glasgow the proposed layoutand material of the London edition, do you, and they make any local variations? A. They make it as they see fit. As far as Glasgow is concerned they havea very considerable amount of autonomy indeed.Sir Peter Rawlinson: We are going to have this from Mr. Johnson, but Ithink it will help in the story if we get it now. Do you agree that the glasgow scheduled time was 9.15 but they did not go until 9.45 on that particular night, is that right? A. Correct.Q. And that Manchester was scheduled at 9.45 but did not actually go onthat night until 10.31?-A. That is correct.Q. And London is scheduled at 5 minutes past 10 and actually went at 10.26? A. I believe that is correct.Q. By the time you spoke on the telephone therefore all the scheduledtimes had passed?-A. The scheduled times for the starting up of all editions,all three first editions in all three centres, had passed, yes.Q. Glasgow would have gone and in fact London went a few minuteslater?-A. Yes.Q. As soon as you had cleared Glasgow about the Polaris and the &apos; D &apos; noticestory who did you speak to then? A. I then rang London.Q. That means you got back to the office? A. I had to go through again.I got to the office again and asked to speak to Mr. Johnson, and he said thathe had received a telephone call at 9.38. He said, &quot; I have written a little notefor you about it, I will read it to you.&quot; He said Colonel Lohan had telephoned,asked for me by name, was told I was not in the office, that I was betweenpoints and could not be contacted, that he, Johnson, was in charge, could hehelp or do anything, and that Colonel Lohan asked if he were running a storyon cable vetting and was told we were. The Colonel then asked Johnson ifthere were any means of stopping it, and Johnson said it was too late, Glasgowhad gone, Manchester were going and London would be going in twenty minutes.He added that Colonel Lohan said his aim had been to ask us to hold the story up for 24 hours so that he could make some more enquiries, and accordingto what Johnson told me he said, when he realised this was impossible he accepted the fact and said it was very sad.Q. When you eventually got back to the office were you shown thatmemo later?-A. I was indeed, yes.Q. Having spoken to Mr. Johnson who gave you the gist of the conversation,did you go back to the dinner? A. I did. I should also put in there thatI did ask Johnson, since this question of &apos; D&apos; notices had come in, I alreadywas working on the assumption we were clear on the cable vetting story.I did specifically ask Mr. Johnson whether Colonel Lohan had made any reference to &apos; D &apos; notices, and Mr. Johnson assured me that he had not.I then went back into the dinner and after some minutes managed to get a.
word with Sir Max, and I told him that as far as I could make out the foreign secretary must have been referring to the story of cable vetting, which he thenheard for the first time, and that I could not understand this because we hadalready got it cleared as being free of &apos; D &apos; notice restrictions early in the evening, otherwise it would not be in the paper. Sir Max then said that under those circumstances I had best return to the office, and since he had taken a callhimself from the Foreign Secretary that I should put a call back to him asa matter of courtesy and explain to him what the situation was, and this Iendeavoured to do.Q. Did you go back to the office, arriving at about 10.45, and speak toMr. Johnson, who gave you the aide memoire, and then did you speak to the resident clerk at the Foreign Office and ask to speak to Mr. Brown? A. Yes.Q. Eventually did you receive a call from Mr. Greig whom you have knownfor many years? A. I did indeed, yes.Q. What did you say, in your recollection, to Mr. Greig? A. I explained tohim as briefly as I could that the Foreign Secretary had been on to Sir MaxAitken, that he had said we had a story under &apos; D&apos; notice in the paper and that sir Max had said if it was under &apos; D &apos; notice we would take it out, and that theonly story we had in the paper to which this could possibly apply was the cablestory which for certain sure was not covered by &apos; D&apos; notice because we had itcleared by Colonel Lohan. To that, according to my recollection, Mr. Greigsaid, &quot; In that case the Foreign Secretary must be under some misapprehension;I should forget about it &quot;.Q. You then telephoned to Sir Max and told him the action you had taken toget a reply through to the Foreign Secretary? A. Correct.Q. You said you got back at 10.45, all the editions had gone, the first editionin London having gone at 10.26. Did Colonel Lohan come on to the telephoneto you shortly after you had spoken to Mr. Greig? A. Yes, shortly after that colonel Lohan came on, and he said that he was surprised to hear that we were running the story in our first London edition in view of the promise that hadbeen given, particularly as it was under &apos; D &apos; notice.Chairman: Did he say whose promise? A. No sir, a promise that had beengiven. I think he said, &quot; a promise to the Foreign Office &quot;, in fact. I pointedout with some vigour that I had been assured by Mr- Pincher that the Colonelhimself had stated it was not under &apos; D &apos; notice. I assumed he knew betweenwhom the conversation had taken place, and said that although I had not been present when the conversation between Sir Max and the Foreign Secretary tookplace I was quite certain that what he had said was that if we were running a story under &apos; D&apos; notice we would take it out, and Colonel Lohan then saidthat he had warned Mr. Pincher that the story was covered by &apos; D&apos; notices. Tothis I said that he had known both Chapman Pincher and myself for a numberof years and he must be perfectly well aware that neither of us would print a story that contravened a &apos; D &apos; notice, and he agreed with this at once. &quot; If the story was in the first edition there was not much that could be done &quot;. I wasnot happy altogether and I just asked him if he could tell me which specific&apos; D&apos; notices this story came under. He said he could not because he had not got the &apos; D &apos; notices with him, and he said again, &quot; Nothing can be done nowanyway &quot;, and the conversation ended there.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Lord Radcliffe asked about &apos; D &apos; notices ; the &apos; D &apos; noticesare kept in a safe, where? A. They are kept in a safe in our newsroom, ouralmost impregnable safe.Q. After that conversation with Colonel Lohan did you have another con-versation with Mr. Greig. I think I can lead you on this. Mr. Greig said theSecretary of State was in a great rage and was threatening all sorts of things? &apos;A. Yes.Q. He said he would ring up Cecil King and complain that Sir Max had broken his word. What did you say when he said that? A. I again said toMr. Greig there could be no question of Sir Max having broken his word, as Iam certain all he said was the story would be stopped if it was under &apos; D &apos; notice.
Q. Did Mr. Greig say anything? A. He said he was sure it was under &apos; D &apos;notice, and I again asked which &apos; D &apos; notice applied.Q. This may be when he did tell you . . . A. There were so many phonecalls that evening it is impossible to sort them all out, even immediately after-wards. But it was either in this one or in the one immediately afterwards thathe gave me reference numbers of relevant &apos; D&apos; notices, and we had someexchange about the relative knowledge of Colonel Lohan on the &apos; D &apos; noticesand the information, because after all Greig said Chapman Pincher knew asmuch, if not more, than Colonel Lohan about it, but that was just an aside.Sir Peter Rawlinson: He having said this, did you try and get in touch with both Sir Max and Mr. Pincher?Chairman: Did you actually look up those &apos; D &apos; notices he had given you the references to? A. No sir, I did not at this stage; I was trying to get hold ofMr. Pincher.Sir Peter Rawlinson: You tried to get hold of him and failed and you alsotried to get hold of Sir Max and failed? A. Indeed.Q. You had these statements of Colonel Lohan on the telephone to you, andthe statements of Mr. Greig on the telephone to you ; at what time, about, was this? Can you give us any approximate time? At 10.45 you were in youroffice. A. It must have been twenty minutes to twelve, about that.Q. Prior to those two statements by Colonel Lohan and Mr. Greig had youany warning at all that the story was contrary to &apos; D&apos; notice? A. Nonewhatsoever.Q. Had the story been published by the time you received those warnings?-A. It had.Q. What did you do at about quarter to twelve when you were faced with this position? A. I was unable to get hold of Mr. Pincher who is the authority onthese matters. I was unable to get hold of Sir Max who had given this under-taking to the Foreign Secretary. I was faced with this situation where theForeign Secretary, or at least Mr. Greig speaking with the authority of theForeign Secretary and I was quite certain that he was maintained that it wasunder &apos; D &apos; notices. I then had to make a decision, and from the strictly securityangle there was no decision to make because the story had already in fact been published. Colonel Lohan had agreed that not much could be done about it;that is, accepting that there was a security angle to it. The sole considerationnow was that Sir Max had said that if it was under &apos; D &apos; notice we would take it out. Faced with that situation I gave instructions to take the story out of thepaper. I was quite confident that, if it was being asserted with this degree of authority at this time of night the story was under &apos; D &apos; notice, everyone elsewould be advised accordingly. I therefore first of all tried to get Colonel Lohan ;his number was tied up. So I spoke to Mr. Greig and told him I was obliged toaccept the view put forward on behalf of the Foreign Secretary that this wasunder &apos; D&apos; notice, and I said, &quot; In the light of what Sir Max has said I havegiven instructions for the story to be taken out&quot;. I then called Colonel Lohan,got through to him, and told him what I was doing, and said &quot; I assume everyoneelse is being stopped &quot;.Q. You told him what you were doing, namely, stopping the story? A. Yes,I said, &quot; I assume everyone else is being stopped&quot;, or words to that effect.Colonel Lohan&apos;s reply was, &quot; I cannot stop anybody else ; to my certain know-ledge the Mail and The Times are going to print it&quot;. This conversation musthave taken place around 12.30, perhaps a little later.Q. Did he say anything else to you in that conversation, before you tell uswhat the effect of that conversation was? A. The end of that conversation, his last words to me were, &quot; Perhaps it would have been better had I spoken to youon the Friday &quot;, but he had not done so because he did not like to go over HarryPincher&apos;s head.Q. That was the end of that conversation, was it? A. That was the end ofthat conversation.
Present:Lord Radcliffe (Chairman)Mr. E. ShinwellMr. Selwyn LloydMr. D. J. Trevelyan (Secretary)The following gave evidence: At 2.15 p.m.     Mr. D. A. Greenhill      Deputy Under-Secretary of State, ForeignOffice2.45 p.m.     Mr. C. T. E. Ewart-      Head of Department, Foreign OfficeBiggs3.15 p.m.     Colonel L. G. LohanMr. D. GreenhillChairman: Mr. Greenhill, could we have your rank in the Foreign Office? A.Yes, I am a deputy under secretary.Q. You have furnished us for our information with a document which perhapsyou will have in front of you. I just want to establish what your connection was with the events which led to the Express article on the Tuesday, the 21st. In factyou did not get back into the Foreign Office you had been away until theMonday? A. That is right.Q. At that time you got a report from Mr. Ewart-Biggs, who I suppose is yourjunior? A. Yes.Q. About these events which had been taking place. He told you I supposewhat action he had arranged by his meeting on the Friday afternoon? A. Yes,he did.Q. He showed you the minutes? A. He did.Q. What was the situation you were faced with after that conversation inwhich Colonel Lohan told you The Times and the Mail were going to print? A. I was then faced with the situation in fact that the idea that one publicationdoes not justify any other breach of the &apos;D&apos; notice was not being applied, andI therefore obviously could not put myself in the situation of taking the storyout, so I countermanded my instructions and called Mr. Greig and advised himaccordingly. I did tell Colonel Lohan in the conversation, incidentally, that i could not take the story out under those circumstances.Q. Was the position this, that you decided to take it out, you telephoned, youlearnt that The Times and the Mail were going to print, so you countermandedthose instructions? A. That is it roughly, but the point really was this. I was prepared to take it out on the basis of the understanding of the pledge givenby Sir Max and in the light of a firm declaration on behalf of the foreign secretary that it was under a &apos; D &apos; notice. That being the case I expected the&apos; D &apos; notice would apply equally to everybody else. When the &apos; D &apos; notice wasnot being applied I am not making any criticism about it, I am just giving myreasons why I changed my course when I found the &apos; D &apos; notice was not being applied, I said, &quot; All right, we must continue to publish &quot;.Q. In fact, did you receive the Mail and The Times? -A. The Mail, as far asI recall, was on my desk at 1 o&apos;clock.(The proceedings were adjourned until Thursday, 16th March, 1967)Minutes of a Meeting of the Committee held in theCabinet Office on Thursday, 16th March, 1967, at 2.15 p.m.
Q. Then perhaps you will in your own words take us through what followed,and how far you were connected with it. A. Yes. He told me what he had done, showed me the minutes of his meeting, and showed me the minutes that hehad put up to the Permanent Under Secretary and the Secretary of State overthe weekend. They seemed in order to me. He then spoke to me about theproblem of speaking to Lohan, the difficulty there was about giving Lohan thefull information which would have permitted him really to give Chapman Pinchera great deal more information than Chapman Pincher had got.Q. ...Q. I just want to get clear how far it was thought safe to enable colonel lohan to know about this, in order that he could work on Chapman Pincher,because he must have some kind of positive brief, must he not?-A. Yes. Mr.Ewart-Biggs did not tell me the precise words he used to him, but to make itabsolutely clear to Mr. Chapman Pincher that we thought that this was a matterof very considerable importance, and that it was very undesirable that it should become public knowledge and be advertised in the newspapers.Q. It was in general phrases of that kind that you tiiought it could be conveyed? A. Yes, and I think the words we used were that we would giveLohan as much information as we thought right and proper, and that he wouldhave to play his hand his own way.Q. You may have given him a difficult hand. A. I think this was understood.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Lohan had been a PRO in the Ministry of Defence, had he not? A. Yes, he had.Q. So he would know a certain amount already, would he not? A. I donot think he did know a lot about it. I think he guessed a lot, but I do notthink he was in possession of anything like the full information.Chairman: I think perhaps Ewart-Biggs is more closely in touch with whatpassed with Lohan than you are, because you did not see Lohan yourself, didyou? A. No. I only spoke to Lohan once, and that was right at the veryend, when Mr. Greig came on to me late at night and said that the Daily Expresswere saying that they did not know &apos; D &apos; notices were involved, and I wasastounded and annoyed to hear that, so I rang up Lohan and I said: &quot; Did youor did you not make it clear that this was a &apos;D &apos; notice-matter? &quot;, and he said he had and he had just come off the phone from speaking to the editor, and heled me to believe that he had had a considerable row with the editor, on thebasis that the editor had gone against a &apos; D &apos; notice subject.Q. The subject of &apos; D&apos; notices is somewhat complicated. You yourself had never read the particular one which was said to be involved? A. I had notread it before this came up, no. -Q. Then your second paragraph I think continues the narrative. A. After Ihad spoken to Ewart-Biggs, he went off to carry out his purposes, and spoke to Lohan, and I asked him to keep me in touch, and at about six oclock he cameand told me that Lohan had had lunch with Chapman Pincher, and that hethought the situation was under control, that Lohan thought the Daily Expresswere not going to publish, and that if they decided to publish we should haveanother opportunity. I thought the matter was sufficiently important to go and see the Secretary of State, which I did at seven o&apos;clock, and told him what had happened. He said: &quot; Shall I ring up Max Aitken now? &quot; and I said I thoughtit was better that the matter was handled through the normal channels, andI said: &quot; In any case if they are going to publish we shall hear, and then it maybe necessary to involve you &quot;. He said: &quot; Do you think they will publish? &quot;and I said: &quot; I understand that they will not, that they will let us know if thereis any more difficulty &quot;, and there I left it and I went home. Then at about ten o&apos;clock Mr. Ewart-Biggs rang me up and said that it was going to be pub-lished in the Scottish edition, so I then rang up the Secretary of State at Mr.Grierson&apos;s and reminded him of our conversation, and said: &quot; I understand the daily Express are going to carry it in their Scottish edition right away &quot;. He then
said: &quot; Well, I will ring up Max Aitken at once &quot;.   I gave him Max Aitken&apos;sI number, and then he rang me back, I suppose about a quarter of an hour or so later, and said: &quot; It&apos;s all right, they are going to kill it&quot;, and I then rangEwart-Biggs, who rang Lohan.Q. Did he say anything else besides: &quot;They are going to kill it&quot;? A. Yes,he said: &quot; They have asked a price for doing so &quot;, or words to that effect, &quot; thatwe shall have to tell them tomorrow what it is all about&quot;, and I took thatreally with a grain of salt, in that I understood then that we would discuss what we would tell the Daily Express.Q. No arrangements were made on the basis of that for interviewing the daily Express! A. Absolutely none, so far as I know, and, as I say, I under-stood that that meant that we would discuss exactly what it was that was saidto the Daily Express.Q. Then we go on with paragraphs 4 and 5. A. Yes. Ewart-Biggs rang meup and said: &quot; They haven&apos;t killed it, it&apos;s running &quot;, and I thought there was absolutely nothing more that one could do about it if it was running. Then thenext thing that happened was that Mr. Greig rang me and said that the Expressmaintained that there had been no &apos; D &apos; notice involved. I then got colonel lohan&apos;s number from Mr. Ewart-Biggs, rang him, then confirmed that he had made it clear that &apos; D&apos; notices were involved. Then I rang Greig again, I gavehim the dates of the &apos; D&apos; notices and suggested that he should tell the Secretaryof State he said he was going to talk to the Secretary of State in any case I said: &quot; You had better tell him where the situation now stands &quot;.Q. You have used the words here: &quot; He said that according to his instructionshe had not leant heavily on the 1961 &apos;D &apos; notice&quot;, you recall that? A. Yes, hesaid that.Q. But you inferred from that that he had made a clear case on the earlierone? A. I am not sure I inferred that, but I did infer that he had carried outthe instruction which had been agreed with Ewart-Biggs earlier, . . .Q. That really is all your connection with the incident itself? A. Yes.Q. ...Mr. Shinwell: On Monday, the 21st, at what time did you have the conversa-tion with the Foreign Secretary?- A. Twice on the Monday, at seven o&apos;clock andwhen he rang me at ten o&apos;clock at night.Q. At ten o&apos;clock at night it related to the conversation which the foreign secretary had with Sir Max Aitken? A. He rang Sir Max Aitken at myinstigation.Q. At what time? A. Ten o&apos;clock.  It was about ten o&apos;clock when I rang theSecretary of State, he must have rung between ten o&apos;clock and 10.15.Q. And his reply to you was that Sir Max had said that the story would bekilled? A. Yes, he said: &quot;It&apos;s all right, they&apos;ve agreed to kill it&quot;. I think thosewere his exact words.Q. At that time had you any knowledge that one of the editions of the Expresshad published the story? A. No. My understanding was that it was about to be well, I think the phrase used to me was that they were running it in the glasgow edition, or they were about to run it in the Glasgow edition. It seemedto me at that time there was still a possibility that it would not be in the Londoneditions, or even that it could be stopped in the Glasgow editions.Q. If it had been published in the Glasgow edition there was no particular value in stopping it in any other edition, was there? A. Oh, I think so.Q. Why? A. Well, I think if it had appeared for a short time in the Glasgowedition I am not sure it would have been picked up by all the other Londoneditions, and if it were taken rapidly out of the Glasgow edition I wonderwhether it would have been picked up on such a wide scale?
Q. But as the Daily Mail was interested in the matter, had been previouslyinterested in the matter, very much so, is it not likely that they would havediscovered this and then proceeded to publish in the Daily Mail? -A. I do not know what they would have done.Q. During your connection with this affair, at any time did you regard this asbeing related to the &apos; D &apos; notice? A. This matter?Q. Yes. A. Immediately I heard of it and studied the &apos; D &apos; notices, I thoughtit was very clearly covered by the &apos; D &apos; notices, and I felt that the &apos; D &apos; noticeprocedure was designed to prevent by agreement the publication of this sort ofmaterial.Q. I do not know whether you are aware, but I put the question to you, that colonel Lohan in his deposition and in his reply to questions seemed to have some doubts about whether it was actually related to the &apos; D&apos; notice, and ratherput the view that this was related more to general security? A. He may havedone that.Q. . . .Q. In the initial stages, when Lohan was associating with Chapman Pincher,when it would appear from statements that he was not convinced that thisrelated to &apos; D &apos; notices, it has been suggested that in the subsequent stages hewas under pressure? A. I do not know what he means by &quot; under pressure &quot;.Certainly it must have been made manifestly clear to him that we did not want the thing published, and we thought that &apos; D&apos; notices were involved, but I thinkit was recognised as I say that he had some slightly difficult row to hoe aboutexplaining why we felt so strongly, within the limits of security.Q. . . .Q. Looking back on it, with hindsight, would it not have been better reallyto put Lohan in the picture to that extent, and indeed for him to have said toPincher: &quot; This is not a case where they are all being vetted, but they have gotto be sorted somewhere, and you can very easily imagine the purposes they are put to &quot;? A. I think this is a very difficult thing, if I may say so, if you havenot persuaded the man not to publish the story. If you tell him a great deal more, there is no guarantee that he is not going to publish his original storyplus the trimmings that you have given him, so you have made a good storyinto a superb story.  So you have to go very carefully with him.Q. . . .Q. But I suppose when you indoctrinate your beginners in the foreign service,one of the first lessons is: no cable communication sent from a country in whichthey are serving is safe from the point of view of security? A. Oh yes.Q -  - - . . ...   &apos;Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Mr. Chapman Pincher said that he has never broken a&apos;D&apos; notice, that he has been working for twenty years and has written 1,500reports involving &apos; D &apos; notices, and that he has never broken a &apos; D &apos; notice. If you have got a man with a record like that, would it not have been better to have told him? A. Well, there are very strict security rules about whom you tell about this, and I certainly would not myself tell Chapman Pincher.Chairman: It is to some extent a technical question, is it not? It is a questionof how far you can chance your arm and take a risk with a particularcorrespondent in communicating things which you can trust him not to pass on?Q. . . .Chairman: There is just one other small point: your first information aboutpublication actually taking place did refer to the Glasgow edition? A. Yes, theinformation I had was that it was either about to appear or appearing in the glasgow edition.Q. Did you pass on that particular fact, &quot; Glasgow &quot;, to the Foreign Secretary?-A. Yes, I did.Chairman: Thank you very much.(The witness withdrew)
Mr. C. T. E. Ewart-BiggsChairman: Mr. Ewart-Biggs, you have kindly given us your written accountof these events which led to the Daily Express article published on the Tuesday,the 21st, and of course it helps us to have this and to go through it followingthat order. Would you tell me first, what is your actual status in the ForeignOffice? A. I am head of the Permanent Under Secretary&apos;s Department, ...Q. I see. We will just keep our eyes on these various paragraphs and take our questions as they come along. You heard that the Daily Express and the daily Mail got hold of the story involving the G.P.O. and four private cable companies on the one side, and, it was alleged, the Ministry of Defence on theother, picking up overseas cables? A. Yes.Q. . . .Q. You then tried to get together, I take it, on the Friday, all the peopleinvolved, either in public departments or in the various private &apos; behind thescreen &apos; departments? A. Yes.Q. And that led to your meeting on the afternoon of the 17th, of which wehave a record in the minutes ; we can see who the various representatives were,and unless you want to draw our attention to anything in particular, we can goon to paragraph 7, where you are saying:&quot;... that the meeting would have to consider (a) what action should betaken with the Press and (b) what action should be taken with enquiries inParliament. Of these, the former was of immediate importance, and ourhandling of the latter would depend on it. He said that no questions on thissubject had yet been addressed to the Foreign Office, and that the Ministry ofDefence were maintaining their denial that any interception of this naturetook place. Mr. . . . said that the G.P.O. had made a similar denial, in response to an enquiry from Chapman Pincher the previous evening.&quot;We have been told that the line of what the G.P.O. had said in response to thatwas that, not all cables were taken away for inspection, but that some were. Isthat consistent with what you heard then? A. I think at the time, and I thoughtalso wh^n trying to reconstruct the narrative of events and what had happened,that the G.P.O. had in fact told the Press that the story was untrue.Q. It does not seem to come out that way, but that is what you were told atthe meeting, is it? A. Yes, and I think it also comes out in the G.P.O. statement.Q. Yes, but we have been hearing actual evidence since. A. I see. Certainlythat was what I understood and what I heard from the G.P.O. when we were trying to piece it all together afterwards.Q. If you had heard that their answer had been on the lines: &quot; Thereis something in this; not all cables are, but some are&quot;, would it have alteredyour subsequent attitude? A. No, I do not think so. In that paragraphof the minutes to which you are referring I was,, merely stating what theposition was at that time, as I understood it, which was that the Ministry ofDefence and the G.P.O. had denied the story. Afterwards we discovered thatthey had done this on the basis that it was factually incorrect, in that notelegrams were sent to the Ministry of Defence.Q. It may have been rather a dangerous line. A. No, I was not intending to suggest here that they should have denied it, merely that they had, and thiswas part of the background that we had to study.Q. Yes.  Now paragraph 9:&quot; The meeting discussed the line that Colonel Lohan should take withChapman Pincher. It was agreed that the subject fell under the termsof the &apos;D&apos; notice of 30th October, 1961, about the interception of foreigncommunications by H.M.G. The meeting considered that it would be unwise to refer to Chapman Pincher the other &apos; D &apos; notice (of 27th April,1956), which had a bearing on this subject, since this referred to intelligencegathering and counter-intelligence activities. Mr. Whyte said that chapman pincher should be left in no doubt that this subject was covered completelyby the &apos; D &apos; notice system.&quot;
If you stop there, the meeting was ruling out the April, 1956, &apos; D &apos; notice? A.Yes. I think I should make clear that this record was made at the time by adyoung man in my department who was there, and it was not as it were alteredor cleared or edited in any way afterwards, because everything has been ratherovertaken by events, and I think in fact in the subsequent discussion we were all pretty clear that the two &apos; D &apos; notices were both infringed by the story.Q. Now in paragraph 14 you come to your conclusion:  &quot; The meeting eventually agreed: -(a) that the Security Service . . .&quot;that would be Mr. ... as your contact? A. Yes.Q. Mr. . . .&quot;... should contact Colonel Lohan, either directly or through . . .to ask him to try and stifle Chapman Pincher&apos;s enquiries by indicating thatthe whole subject came under the terms of the &apos; D&apos; notice of 30th October,1961, without admitting that H.M.G. actually engaged in the interception of telegrams. Colonel Lohan should base his case on the Official Secrets Actand attempt to give no further information away. He should report theresults of his interview subsequently to the Security Service. In response to an enquiry Mr. . . . confirmed that no reporter who had been approached as a result of the &apos; D &apos; notice had used the fact of this approachin a published story but the possibility always existed.&quot;Colonel Lohan had not at this stage been brought into discussion as to howfar this action was feasible in his dealings wiuh the Press? He was notthere? A. He was not there, no.Q. What was the next thing that happened? We go back to our document,Appendix III. A. I think the next thing that happened immediately perhaps i could make one comment on this, and that is I am not sure that these minutesare quite accurate in just referring in paragraph 14(a) to the &apos; D&apos; notice of1961, and I think it was the general view that both &apos; D&apos; notices were in factinvolved, although 1961 was the one most clearly relevant.Q. . . .Q. To the outside world it does not very much matter which branch ofsecret activity is being carried out by which of the officials. A. Except that the1956 &apos; D &apos; notice does specifically say that it is intended to cover M.I.5 and M.I.6 in order I think to strengthen its impact on the press. We did deal with that particular point in the paper on the application of the &apos; D&apos; notices to the casein question.Q. Anyway your impression of this meeting was that both the Defence noticeswere in your mind and Colonel Lohan was to be set in motion according to the agreed instructions? A. Colonel Lohan was to continue to try and get the storydropped, because we knew he had already been in touch with the press about it, and that he should continue to try and get it stopped on &apos; D &apos; notice grounds,while at the same time not giving away too much information about what wasthe actual practice involved.Q. I will come to that, because I think some of the difference may have comefrom limitations about what he could say. At any rate your paragraph 2 now.You yourself got into touch with Colonel Lohan on the Saturday. A. Yes.Q. Did anything on that matter pass on the Saturday between you and him? A. I merely asked him how he was getting on, and where the thing stood, whichwas my prime motive in getting hold of him.Q. Had you met him? Did you know him as a person? A. Only on the telephone. I had never met him face to face. I had had dealings with himon the telephone before. The first thing I did after the meeting was to reportthe situation to the Permanent Under-Secretary and Sir Burke Trend, andwrite a minute describing the results of my meeting, which went that night tothe Secretary of State.  I think you have the minute?
Q. Yes. A. And the minute does I think make clear that this is what wekvere proposing to do, to instruct Colonel Lohan through the Security Service&apos;to get the story stopped.Q. Then you yourself contacted Lohan on the Saturday morning? A. Yes, Irang up Lohan on Saturday morning. I was concerned about the whole thing.I wanted to know how the whole matter stood. I was also somewhat concerned that he should not give too much away in speaking to Chapman Pincher, soI rang him up with the idea of checking up to see the sort of line he was going to take.Q. That was on Saturday or Monday? In the end I think you were theperson who really said, &quot; We cannot all give him instructions. I will give them &quot;? A. That was on Monday. On the Saturday I did mention certainlythe &apos; D&apos; notices, and the 1961 one, and I think I did mention as far as Iremember my worry that he should not give away too much about what was involved.Q. How much did you think he knew though, that he could give away? A.I was not altogether clear about exactly what he knew of the practice, butit did seem to me and in this I was somewhat inhibited in dealing with him but it did seem to me from talking to him that he was aware broadly of whatwas going on, and indeed this I imagine to be the case, because I knew he hadbeen public relations officer at the Ministry of Defence before, so I assumed,and I think this was borne out from the way the conversations went withhim, that he did in fact know pretty well what was involved . . .Q. What strikes me as a slightly difficult thing is if it was to be rammedhome to a correspondent that it was within, let us say, the &apos; D&apos; notice of April,1956, and the correspondent had to be assured that what he was talking aboutwas a secret intelligence method, and if it was not that it did not come withinthe &apos; D &apos; notice. . . . A. I think, as I said in this thing, I think this was a real difficulty. At the time Colonel Lohan seemed to think he was able to manageChapman Pincher on the basis that this was an activity that fell under the&apos; D &apos; notices, and involved a matter of defence of the Realm, without going intotoo much detail about exactly how and why,Q. The defence of the Realm is a jolly good phrase, but unless you can makeit more concrete it is not likely to weigh with a newspapers defence corres-correspondent is it? If you are going to operate on him and satisfy him that he is bound in honour either under &apos; D &apos; notices or under some security appeal notto publish, you have to bring yourself down to detail to some extent, have younot? A. Yes. I do not know exactly what line Colonel Lohan did take with Chapman Pincher. The line that would have been consistent with what i said to him would have been that &quot; this story refers to an activity which fallsgenerally under the &apos; D &apos; notices. I cannot give you too much detail about whyor how, but I can assure you that it involves a matter of national security, andthat we would regard it as infringing the &apos; D &apos; notice if you published it.&quot; Thatwould have been the line that would have been in keeping with what I saidto him. At the time we thought that he was able to persuade Chapman Pincheralong these lines not to publish it, and we were anxious that Chapman Pinchershould not be told too much about what was going on, because, quite frankly,I estimated Chapman Pincher to be the type of journalist who would not be beyond using any official information he was told in confidence by Lohan.Q. That was a thing which I take it Colonel Lohan himself should have advised you on, should he not? He must have been dealing with these peoplealways. I do not know what his view was on that. A. Yes. I think we regardedLohan as a bridge between the Government and the press. I did not think ofmyself as telling him exactly what he was going to say to Chapman Pincher.Q. No. A. I thought of myself as telling him that we very much wantedChapman Pincher not to publish this story on &apos; D&apos; notice grounds, and thathe must therefore use with Chapman Pincher the argument he thought most
effective in achieving this result, but at the same time we did not want him to giveaway to Chapman Pincher too much about the exact nature, scope and purposejof what was really involved ; . . .Q. . . .Q. If he could not and I quite understand tell him that, how much could he tell him that would persuade him that &apos; D&apos; notices and secret nationalactivities were involved and by &quot; national&quot; I mean Governmental activities were involved? A. We were hoping I think that he would imply that sometelegrams were intercepted for certain purposes, and that he could not go intotoo much detail about how, but that this was necessary for the security of thenation, or for the defence of the Realm I think was the phrase we thought couldbe used, and then there was quite a lot of argument about the arguments he could use in trying to convince Chapman Pincher.Q. This is between you and Lohan on the Monday morning? A. Yes.Q. What did he say to you when you outlined your plan, as it were? Whatwas his line &quot;I can carry this, don&apos;t trouble&quot; or . . .? A. His line was thathe thought it was going to be all right.Q. Did he say, &quot; I think I can do this on general grounds&quot;? Did he give you any line as to what he thought, how he would have to operate? A. How weleft it was that he would try and convince Chapman Pincher to drop the thing byimplying that what was involved was a question of national security, and was covered by the &apos; D &apos; notices, without going into detail, without ... if he couldavoid it.Q. ...Q. I think that is the point. A. That was our concern.Q. Now I think you have been outlining to us the lines that you wantedColonel Lohan to work on when you spoke to him on the Monday morning? A. Yes.Q. ...Q. That would mean he really was not encouraged at any rate to enlarge uponthe 1961 &apos;D&apos; notice?-A. No, but it was quite clear that it was the 1961 &apos;D&apos;notice and the 1956 one that were involved.Q. I would have thought reading the 1961 &apos;D&apos; notice by itself it dealt withthe interception of radio communications passing between, two different ares which we succeeded in intercepting and then breaking down if we are lucky, andmost people would read it that way, but you think it referred to cables? A. Ithink it does refer to cables. It talks of foreign communications.Q. Paragraph 5 this is what Colonel Lohan said to you?-A. Yes. I firstheard these arguments and these propositions to say in reply to them fromMr. ... of the Security Service, who rang me up to consult me, and we agreed together that I would talk to Colonel Lohan and tell him that he could use these arguments.Q. That it arose under the Official Secrets Act of 1920, section 4? Yes. I understood that Chapman Pincher had asked whether what was done was authorised.Q. That takes us to paragraph 6. You thought he was going to talk about&apos; D &apos; notice grounds. Then we will go back perhaps to the second part of what you have given us, which is Appendix VI in our papers I think. On 20thFebruary you telephoned Colonel Lohan in the afternoon, and he was thenvery optimistic. This is the impression he gave you, that he had convincedChapman Pincher not to use it? A. Yes, he thought it was all right.Q. And the Daily Mail had been successfully approached. Then colonel lohan rang you at about 6.15 and again at 10 o&apos;clock Mr. ... of the security service told you about the Glasgow edition of the Daily Express which was runnin, and you got on to Mr. Greenhill from whom we have heard. A. Yes.As it was 10 o&apos;clock I realised that it was either too late or very nearly too late,and anything that was done must be done very fast, so I did not stop to check
with Colonel Lohan, I rang up Mr. Greenhill right away, because I knew thatihe had previously talked with the Secretary of State about the possibility of theSecretary of State intervening, so I thought this was the only thing left at that point.Q. Now paragraph 5, Colonel Lohan telephoning you. It was at that point that he explained that he had acted on his own initiative in releasing the daily mail, because he thought he could not hold that if the Express was actuallycoming out with it. A. Yes.Q. And that was a matter I take it of his own Press Committee&apos;s procedurereally? You did not query that or did you? A. I was worried that he had done this, because I realised that if the Secretary of State persuaded the daily express not to run the story then we would be left with the Daily Mail, so I saidsomething like, &quot; Why did you do that? &quot;Q. I suppose Colonel Lohan did not know at that moment the Secretary ofState was being brought into action, did he? A. When he told me about the daily Mail I did say, &quot;We are trying at a higher level to get this stopped&quot;.Then when I heard from Mr. Greenhill shortly afterwards that the Secretaryof State had spoken to the Daily Express and they had agreed to kill the story,I very quickly rang up Colonel Lohan to tell him to get the Daily Mail to go into reverse once more.Q. Then we have these to-ings and fro-ings. Now paragraph 10. You werehearing from Colonel Lohan that the Express were going to drop it after all:  &quot; I informed Mr. Greenhill. He told me that the Daily Express&apos;s con-dition for not publishing had been that they should be told the full story ;we should therefore have to prepare a version for Colonel Lohan to give them.&quot;Can you enlarge on that particular bit of information?-A. What Mr. Greenhillsaid as far as I remember was that the Secretary of State had got Sir MaxAitken to drop the story, but that Sir Max Aitken had wanted them to be toldspecifically the full facts.Q. Did you get the impression that he was to be told it with a view to thembeing allowed to publish? A. No.Q. He was going to be given background in exchange? A. The very reverseis the impression I got, that he had agreed not to publish it, but wanted to be told why.Q. In fact you began to make arrangements, . . .? A. Yes. I realised that what we told the proprietor of the Daily Express would have to be rathercarefully considered.Q. I think the rest is only exchanges we have heard about already. In para-graph 13 Mr. Marks was in the course of giving exchanges with Mr. Greig. A. Yes.Q. Mr. Marks I think had said, &quot; What are the &apos; D&apos; notices that Mr. Greigwas talking about? &quot; and the Foreign Office was asked to identify them. Is thatright? Were you asked? A. Yes. I think when Mr. Greenhill rang me uphe said, &quot;What are the &apos;D&apos; notices involved?&quot; and I said it fell clearlyunder the &apos;D &apos; notice of 1961.Q. Why did you concentrate on that one at that point? A. That was theone that we particularly had in mind.Q----Q. I was only puzzled as you felt and I quite understand great delicacyabout the 1961 notice being used, that that was the only one you quoted when mr. Marks was asking for a reference, because that brings it back into pre-dominance. A. I cannot actually remember precisely what I said to Mr.Greenhill, but I think I probably mentioned the other one as well. The two arebracketed in my mind.Chairman: I think that has taken us through the story.191
Mr. Shinwell: When you first heard about this story, did you regard it asserious and that publication might be embarrassing? A. Yes.Q. You did.  You sought to have the story stifled? A. Yes.Q. But you trusted Colonel Lohan to deal with it? A. The only possible way of getting it stifled was through the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure. We have noother sanction on the Press.Q. It was related in your view to &apos; D &apos; notice procedure. Colonel Lohan&apos;sfunction is primarily as Secretary of the Press and Broadcasting Committee?-A. Yes.Q. And he does not ordinarily deal with security matters, except in relation to&apos;D&apos; notices? A. Except in relation to &apos;D&apos; notices.Q. When it appeared that to argue the &apos; D &apos; notices might not lead to any useful response, you suggested that he should raise the question of security, andpossibly some infringement of the Official Secrets Act? A. I do not think thatis quite right, sir.  I never suggested he should not argue . . .Q. Tell me in your own words what you said to Colonel Lohan, what instruc-tions you gave him? A. I had a lot of conversations with him, but the lineof advice I gave him was that he should argue or he should tell chapman pincher the story covered an activity that fell under the &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. At no time during the proceedings did you realise that Colonel Lohanwas experiencing some difficulty in convincing Chapman Pincher that thisrelated to the &apos; D&apos; notices? A. I realised when I spoke to Colonel Lohan onthe Monday morning that there might be a difficulty over the 1961 &apos; D&apos; notice,. . . but he seemed to think that he would be able to deal with chapman pincher along the lines we agreed, and, indeed, after seeing him at lunch-time he told me he thought he had been successful.Q. And you fully trusted Colonel Lohan to deal with this matter all through? A. I had no other means.Q. If you regarded it as a serious matter, would it not have been appropriateat some stage, perhaps on Monday morning, to have, not yourself directly, butthrough some other appropriate medium, approached the editor? A. TheForeign Office itself could not I think get hold of the editor of a newspaperand ask them not to publish a story of this kind.Q. In point of fact the Foreign Secretary did approach the newspaper that night? A. Yes, he did.Q. How do you reconcile these two statements? A. At the time we knew the story perhaps I could go back to the beginning?        iQ----Mr. Shinwell: If Colonel Lohan was instructed to make a deal with chapman pincher, because that is really what it amounted to, whether on the basis ofthe &apos; D&apos; notices, or by reference to security, or some infringement of the official secrets Act, and so on, you must at some time have realised that he was insome difficulty? A. I think there is a distinction in what you are saying. I gather you were making a distinction between telling Chapman Pincher that we did not want this published on &apos; D &apos; notice grounds, and telling Chapman Pincherthat we did not want it published on national security grounds.Q. That is precisely what Colonel Lohan was expected to do. A. In my view, you know, right from the beginning there was no such distinction. The&apos; D &apos; notice procedure is designed to try to stop newspapers publishing matters that would be damaging to national security. Therefore there is not a distinctionbetween telling him not to publish it on national security grounds and telling himnot to publish it on &apos;D&apos; notice grounds. I was always assuming throughoutthat Colonel Lohan, who is the &apos; D &apos; notice authority, was asking the daily express not to publish this on &apos; D &apos; notice grounds, and indeed these are theonly grounds on which Cnlonel Lohan can ask a newspaper not to publish.
Q. Are you aware that in his deposition Colonel Lohan has stated when hemet Chapman Pincher at lunch on Monday 21st that he produced the &apos; D &apos; noticesand then replaced them in his pocket, and the question of &apos; D &apos; notices apparentlydid not apply? A. I saw in his statement that he produced &apos; D &apos; notices and said he was basing his argument upon them, and then subsequently said he would put them aside.Q. And then afterwards he was compelled to use a different argument becauseChapman Pincher refused to accept them? A. Yes.Q. That this was related to &apos; D &apos; notices. A. Chapman Pincher refused toaccept either of the two &apos; D &apos; notices applied.Q. Was any pressure brought to bear on Colonel Lohan to change his tactics,to change his story, between the previous Thursday and Monday? A. No.Q. He received instructions, did he not?-A. We discussed with him the line that he might take with Chapman Pincher, and I thought this was understood.He then saw Chapman Pincher at lunch time, and reported that he thoughthe had convinced Chapman Pincher, and Chapman Pincher was going to see hiseditor.Q. He stated quite categorically to his superiors, or the Foreign Office, thathe had concluded a deal with Chapman Pincher, and the story would not bepublished. A. He did not say he had concluded a deal. He said that he thoughthe had convinced him, words to that effect.Q. He in your view was . . . A. He seemed confident. He said chapman pincher would put the case to his editor.Q. And you were quite convinced it was all right? A. I hoped it was allright.   I would not say I was convinced it was all right.Q. If you were not convinced, surely some other action would have beenappropriate, if the story was of such gravity, or likely to prove embarrassing? A. We thought at that time that it would be all right. We also thought thatthere would be a further opportunity to do more, because we understood thatChapman Pincher had told Colonel Lohan that if he did not succeed with hiseditor he would let Colonel Lohan know.Q. You thought there was a possibility of some change in the course of the evening? A. Yes. After the lunch between Chapman Pincher and colonel lohan, Colonel Lohan reported to me that he thought all was going to be well,and that Chapman Pincher he thought he had convinced Chapman Pincher would advise his editor in this sense, and he would let Colonel Lohan know whatthe result was. This was what I thought was the position.Q. Colonel Lohan discovered later that the story was likely to be published? A. It was discovered later that the story was going to be published.Q. What action did you take then?-A. When I learned&apos;the story was goingto be published I immediately rang up Mr. Greenhill because I knew that Mr.Greenhill had been in touch with the Secretary of State when I had reported the position before and the Secretary of State had raised the possibility of himselftaking the matter up with Sir Max Aitken.Q. By this time the story had been published in the Glasgow edition of the express? A. Yes, or this is what Chapman Pincher told Colonel Lohan, thatit was being published I think in the Glasgow edition.Q. It was known surely when the Secretary of State phoned Sir Max Aitken,it was then known that the story had already appeared in the Glasgow editionof the Express? A. I do not know this I am afraid.Q. You were not aware of that? A. All I know is that at about 10 o&apos;clockin the evening I was telephoned by the Security Service who had heard form colonel Lohan that the Express were running the story in their Glasgow edition.I realised then that the only hope of getting the story stopped would be to do something at very high level, so I rang up Mr. Greenhill, my superior.Q. What time was that? A. Immediately I heard from Colonel Lohan. Itmust have been very shortly after ten.193
Q. After ten? A. Yes.Q. By that time the story had already appeared in the Glasgow edition. A. Idare say it had.Q. You were not aware of that? A. No, I was not aware of this. All I heardwas a brief message from Mr. ... in the Security Service that he had heard the express were running the story in their Glasgow edition.Q. Here in the course of this day, Monday, there was a lunch at whichColonel Lohan had talks with Chapman Pincher, they did not come to any definite agreement at lunch, and subsequently Colonel Lohan had the impression that Chapman Pincher was going to intercede with the Express not to publishedalthough the editor was not aware of the story at that time, so he told us ; thensubsequently the Glasgow edition published the story, and that was the position.Is this the way the Foreign Office works in matters of this sort? A. nothing of what you say is anything about what the Foreign Office has been doing.You have been explaining to me what the Daily Express were doing in theirGlasgow edition.Mr. Shinwell: What occurs to me is if this is a matter of such seriousness, more appropriate action might have been taken not to leave it in the hands of colonel lohan.Chairman: I think Mr. Greenhill did tell us this afternoon that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had asked in the late afternoon of Monday shouldhe intervene personally, and Mr. Greenhill had said to keep it through what hecalied the usual channels. A. Yes, I think that is correct. After Colonel Lohanhad reported to me following his lunch what the position was, I reported this position to Mr. Greenhill, who in turn spoke to the Secretary of State about it,and they discussed whether the Secretary of State should approach Sir MaxAitken about this, and they decided that as there would be another opportunity,as Chapman Pincher had said that he would let Colonel Lohan know what theresult of his approach to his editor would be, that this should not happen. Ishould say that it is not at all usual, and would be a fairly dangerous course,for the Foreign Secretary to approach a newspaper in order to try and get a story about an activity dropped from a newspaper, and this is a procedure thathas its hazards.   I think this was realised on that afternoon.Mr. Shinwell: This is a matter which was left in the hands of Colonel Lohan.You were aware that he produced &apos;D&apos; notices in the presence of chapman pincher in a public restaurant in full view of the public. Is that customary? A. I should not have thought it was particularly wise, no. I would like to stressthat I am not in any way responsible for the behaviour either of Colonel Lohan,or of the Daily Express.Q. We know that, and that prompts me to say that you were not responsiblefoi the conduct of Colonel Lohan, but this was a person who was entrusted withthe task of dealing with a matter of considerable importance. I only put that. -A. There being no censorship of the Press in this country, for very good reasons,the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure is the only procedure whereby there is any prospector hope of getting the newspapers not to publish stories we think are damaging to national security.  This is really the only means we have of doing this.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: You had this conversation at 6.15 on the Monday in which you were told Chapman Pincher was going to write the story so that the editorcould see what he thought? A. Yes.Q. There was no other means in being from your point of view.-A. No, when heard this I was worried.Q. Did you know that Colonel Lohan was going to be out of circulation forlong that evening? A. No.Q. He went and caught a train which left at 7.49 and he got to his home atten past nine. With a train which left at ten to eight I ^assume he must have left his office, wherever it was, some time before that. Did you know he was going to be out of circulation? A. No, I did not.
Q. Then in your discussions with him at an earlier stage, was there any argu-ment between you and him, or any of your advisers arid him, to the effect that the1956 &apos; D&apos; notice was really untenable because of what had happened withtelephone tapping and it was untenable in this case? A. No, I do not think there was.Q. You do not remember that being put? A. No.Q----Q. You do not remember the argument about the telephone tapping casereferred to at all? A. I do not remember this coming up beforehand. it certainly came up afterwards as an argument that had been used by chapman pincher, but certainly it was not our view that the 1956 &apos; D &apos; notice was invalidatedby the other &apos;D&apos; notice referring to telephone tapping.Q. Invalidated with regard to any method or any process which was more orless public property. The &apos; D &apos; notice Appendix begins:&quot; Certain methods employed in Intelligence work, are to some extent amatter of common knowledge.&quot;-A. Yes. I think the argument used by Chapman Pincher there was a &apos; D&apos;notice issued in I think 1958 after the . . .Chairman: October, 1957.-A. After the Birkett Report, and it referred to telephone tapping. It said that as telephone tapping had been mentioned in theBirkett Report, secrecy could not be maintained on this subject. chapman pincher argued that intercepting cables was an exactly parallel activity andtherefore that was covered too.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Colonel Lohan had never given you the impression thathe rather accepted that argument? A. No, I do not think he did; I do notrecollect this.  I heard about it afterwards.Chairman: Thank you very much.(The witness withdrew)Evidence of Colonel L. G. LohanChairman: Why I want you back at this stage is that firstly there are certain parts of your aide memoire that you gave us which, as you noticed, I couldnot let you introduce while the Express and their representatives were here, andthere may be one or two questions arising out of this which I would like to go through with you now. Have you got the aide memoire and also the supplemen-tary note which you sent in?-A. Yes, the two things I prepared for you.Q. The first question is on paragraph 9 of your original aide memoire. Thatis Friday the 17th and you &quot;have had the Pincher opening message to which you gave the reply we know. You then got in touch with ... I want you totell us what you learnt on that occasion. A I was just going out and my assistanttelephoned me from the office and said Mr. . . . wanted me.Q. Is he a regular contact of yours? A. Yes, recently because we have beenrewriting these &apos; D&apos; notices, and this specific &apos; D&apos; notice which I attached as an example to my aide memoire, and we had been very close. . . .He started off by telling me he did not mention Pincher&apos;s name first of all that the Daily Mail artd the Daily Express had been making inquiries at theMinistry of Defence about the interception of telegrams and cables, and heobviously had to be very guarded. I said, &quot;Say little more, I now understand what you mean &quot;, because he put a totally different slant on the story, it was ina totally different context from the way Pincher had rather cleverly put it to meon the Thursday.Q. Why? Did that divert your mind from the Ministry of Defence? A. Yes,that completely hooked me. I notice that in page 40 of Derek Marks&apos; evidencehe says Pincher said that immediately Lawson had told him the story he telephonedme and not the Ministry of Defence. This is my recollection of the thing.Pincher did not give me the impression he had telephone the Ministry of
Defence at all. It is also surprising because I would have expected in any reasonable way that the Ministry of Defence would have immediately got backto me and said &quot; watch this one&quot;. However, the story that Pincher gave mewas undoubtedly that it was G.P.O. telegrams and it was the Ministry of Defence.Q. I do not want you to go back over any controversial matters, because theyare not here now. A. I was completely thrown by that, my lord, and it wasnot until . . . mentioned . . . and it was . . . speaking, and this was good enough for me because this immediately rooted my attention to the importance of the story, the fact that . . . had come up with it.Q. Now the Foreign Office. A. I am not absolutely certain of this. I spoke to two people in the Foreign Office, Ewart-Biggs and somebody else. I think itwas he who got on to me and asked what I was going to do about it. It wasthen that the &apos; D &apos; notices came into it. I did not discuss much on the &apos; D &apos; noticeat that time with ... I said, &quot; Speaking without the book . . .&quot; I did not use these words but this is what I meant, that is to say, &quot; Speaking without any&apos; D &apos; notices, I think there are two notices ; certainly the one of 27th Aprilought to cover us, but there is another one about interception that ought tocover us ; I will act on that.&quot; He sounded a little doubtful. I said, &quot; In anycase, I can always go outside &apos;D &apos; notices.&quot; I do not have to keep to the strictletter of &apos; D &apos; notices ; in fact I very rarely have. I said, &quot; Do not worry, I willtake action with the Daily Mail, and as a matter of fact I will do the Daily Mailfirst because they are obviously going to be the easier of the two.&quot; I knew ifnecessary I could go very high up in the Daily Mail and stop it; I knew myinfluence with the Daily Mail was very good indeed.Q. Is it not rather dangerous not to keep to the form of words of &apos;D &apos; notices,because after all it is on that wording that you have got the agreement of thepress representatives? A. My lord, I never ignore the wording. I always feelthat with &apos; D &apos; notices if you start off with a correspondent or an editor with alittle too much emphasis on the words as they are you immediately get into an argument trying to defend the words and defend the phrases. I can assure you in quite a long experience and I told you wrongly the other day, in fact it wasin March, 1962 that I started in quite a long experience of this business I knowit is no good entering into semi-legalistic arguments with journalists ; it doesnot work.Q. I quite sympathise with you. On the other hand, the actual form of wordingis hammered out in fact at your committee with press representatives, it it not?There you have to become rather literal and see how to express yourself. A. Inthat sense they are, but a lot of &apos; D &apos; notices in my view are very badly worded.Q. I think that may be true. I hope that is leading you to reword them. A.That is what has led me to reword them. I am rewording the lot. In practicetime after time I have argued with journalists over matters of semantics. Evenyourself yesterday, you were leading just a little into &quot;What do you mean bymethod, and what do you mean by activity?&quot; It is very distressing because to sit down to have to argue about words with journalists who are not very goodat that sort of thing neither am I if it comes to that. Therefore I do try tokeep to the spirit.Q. This may arise on the second part of our inquiry. I think it very likelytrue that a number of the &apos; D&apos; notices are not very happily worded. would it help you in the future if you had I do not know how trained you are but atrained draftsman? A. I am a trained draftsman.Q. You say people do not like getting locked in legal arguments about themeaning of words, but they are your sheet anchor? A. They are indeed, andthose are precisely the words I use to myself; these are the anchor of all myarguments. But it is extremely difficult if one avoids the spirit of &apos; D &apos; notices ;if one throws that away in trying to claim the letter one is inevitably led tofailure ; so I have found ; or at least rather bad blood, and finally an appealto an editor or a proprietor.
Q. Just to finish off paragraph 9, ... By that day, the Friday, had you seenanything that could be called instructions about the line that you were goingto be asked to take in dealing with this story, whether with Pincher, the Mail,or anybody else? A. No, I think on the whole advice rather than being givenwas being sought. It was I who was saying, &quot; This is the only practical way Ican help, by the use of these two &apos; D&apos; notices &quot;, and I saw, in my own mind&apos;seye while I was talking, the difficulties, because I have terrible difficulties withthis wretched &apos; D &apos; notice that deals with methods and activities, because peoplesay it can mean anything and everything. With the other one I had already had some difficulty, actually with Pincher on one occasion, and another timewhen somebody else, I think it was the Telegraph, wanted to talk aboutinterception, and they claimed that in this case it was one of our own signalswhich was exercised in North Africa, and I was arguing that signal nets shouldnot be reproduced in the newspaper because this would allow for interception.They again argued that this was not a foreign communication, this was aBritish communication. So I have had difficulty with both of these &apos; D&apos;notices over the wording.Q. Perhaps at the end I wfil ask you one or two questions about thesealleged misunderstandings about the 1956 &apos; D &apos; notice. It is narrative we are on at the moment. On the Friday, although you had informed yourself whatlay behind this story, nobody said to you, &quot;We have talked it over and wouldlike you to take this or that line &quot;? A. No. I spoke several times with theSecurity office with whom I have more to do than anybody else, and I madethe offer many many more times than once. Several times I said, &quot; I will come up to London if you want me to &quot;, because over the open telephone this was notvery good. The answer was, &quot; No, you seem to understand what it is ; can youhold it?&quot; I said, &quot;At least I can put in a holding operation.&quot; I was quitehopeful I could, quite certain I could, and I succeeded. There were no definite instructions as such and certainly not a co-ordinated instruction. There hadbeen several suggestions, but they were all talking separately.Q. That I will come to. They talked separately because you approachedseveral people? A. Yes indeed, sir. I offered to come up to London, andthey were all separate and different approaches.Q. I did not take you through paragraph 14 because I do not think that is anything but your own mind. We have read that-A. May I,&apos;with yourpermission, my lord, make a comment on paragraph 14?Q. Yes. A. This is apropos of what Pincher said yesterday. He gave you the impression I brought along the &apos; D&apos; notices with me in my talk to prove that they did not matter. I assure you I brought them along to assure him theydid matter.Q. Colonel Lohan, I think we have digested that particular aspect of it.Paragraph 24: you have seen Pincher, you have seen the Daily Mail; you havenot got any final statement from Pincher by 6.40. Just after 7 o&apos;clock you went to the Ministry of Defence.  This is Monday, the 20th. A. Yes.Q. What passed there? A. I saw Sir James Dunnett. I had alreadytelephoned his office earlier about it to say I should probably want to see him.With Sir James Dunnett he seemed to be very well in the picture I brieflyoutiined to him how I saw it, and said that I had been able to do this on thebasis of &apos; D&apos; notices. I am not sure whether I used this expression, but some-thing like it; I said, &quot; I am skating on very thin ice, nevertheless I think I amholding it.&quot; Anyhow, I certainly used some expression to show I was unhappyabout the actual technical wording of the &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. Did he give you any instructions? A. No, he was off to see Sir BurkeTrend immediately. I gave him the impression I was holding myself, that I wasfairly confident things were going all right. I told him the Mail were certainlyall right, and I told him, &quot; I am worried about the Daily Express because I still have not heard the editorial decision &quot;. As a matter of fact it was the conversa-tion I had with Pincher after 6.30, at about 6.40, because he could not telephoneme at 6.30 or just before because my telephone goes off.   I rang him at 6.30197
and said &quot; For heaven&apos;s sake, my number is changed to 1022 ; don&apos;t forgetthat in case you want me&quot;. Before I went off to the Ministry of Defence Irang my wife and said, &quot; If Chapman Pincher rings you are to ring straightback to Mrs. Marshall, my assistant, and tell her what it is &quot;, and I gave Mrs.Marshall instructions to stay in the office so that she could ring to my officedirect.Q. She was your contact? A. She was my point of contact for the rest ofthe evening.   I had no idea what train I was going to catch, none whatever.Q. When were you able to release Mrs. Marshall you had left her incharge? A. I tried to telephone Mrs. Marshall at her home at about 9.20or thereabouts. I could not get any answer. I tried the office, but I could not get any answer. I presume by that time she had gone. I told her to stay areasonable time, until she thought I had got home. I had not been able to telephone her from the Ministry of Defence because I had about three minutesto make it to Victoria station. For Pincher to say that I told him what train Iwould catch is nonsense. It takes him longer to get home than me, and he very carefully asked me how long I had been home. I said I had just got in; in factI had been in about twenty minutes, and since my wife told me there had been no call from Pincher or the Express I was a happy man ; I thought, &quot; Good,they are not going to publish today &quot;.Q. Now paragraph 40, &quot;Consultation and briefing&quot;. I did not let you go into that but I want a bit from you now about what this amounted to. Atsome stage, apart from your own enquiries on the Friday, you got briefing? A.These are all on the telephone ; I did not in fact meet anybody.Q. I was taking it it was on the morning of Monday, Mr. Ewart-Biggs?-A.Yes, I was able to use my scrambler telephone so we were a litde freer. once again I gave as much as I got in the way of advice. I would say, &quot;Yes, thisis all right; I think we are able to hold this one &quot;. Again, I am not sure whatexpression I used but giving the impression that I could hold it on a generalityrather than on a particular &apos; D &apos; notice if necessary.Q. Yes, I know, but when did you last speak, before the lunch on Monday,with the Security Service?- A. I must have spoken on two occasions that morning to both of them ... and it must have been within minutes of going off toluncheon.Q. Did Mr. Ewart-Biggs on Monday morning give you the impression that hewas giving, as it were, the final interpretation of what you were to do, or werethey all coming at you from different angles? A. They were all coming at me from their own angle. The people who were most worried and obviously themost concerned were represented by Ewart-Biggs ; they were obviously showingthe most concern. In fact I remember complaining rather bitterly in one ofmy conversations with . . . there were so many conversations that morning thatI regretted that they were not quite aware of how newspaper minds work, andthat one could not go to a newspaper with &apos; D&apos; notices anyhow and talk aboutmandatory action or sanctions or anything like that. One had to do it with good will because, and I said so to Ewart-Biggs, this did depend on good will.Q. . . .Q. Did you explain to those who were trying to give you this briefing thatreally one way and another there was not anything left that you could say? A. No, I did not, my Lord, because I was quite convinced that I could carrythis, as I have done many many times. I was convinced that I could carrythis I was wrong of course on the issue that this is not in the public interest to publish ; never mind the actual wording of &apos; D &apos; notices ; they are the &apos; D &apos; notices,they set the area, the parameter if you like, but I was convinced they could say enough without giving the game away. In those circumstances we got atone time to Ewart-Biggs saying how far I could go, and he was worried as to how far I could go. Although I did not say it to him, in my own mind I wouldcertainly not have recommended telling Chapman Pincher or his editor the truth,
because, if one had told them the truth about this operation, in three months&apos;time as sure as I am here they would have it out in one way or the other, orthey would use it in the funny way they have of going to somebody and saying&quot; I know that&quot;, and somebody inadvertently playing it back to them and giving them the story. I would in no circumstances have taken the risk myself of tellingthem the truth, or advising the Security Service or the Foreign Office to authoriseme to tell them the truth, or have &quot;taken anybody along, it would have beendisastrous.Q. ...Q. That was an element when you said it that weighed very much with them,not to publish? A. It did, but I had to wriggle out of it because there could have been trouble about that, because if they were eventually publishing this story,because they were going to follow the Express, in order to be different they mighthave said &quot; Big spy hunt follows cables scrutiny &quot;. This is the way they wouldhave played it if I had not dampened them down rather quickly.Q.....Q. I think that is all we did jiot cover in your aide memoire. I will just lookback at your supplementary note and see if there is anything there we want tofollow up. You do say in point 8 of the supplementary memorandum that theadvice you received was somewhat contradictory, but you have said all youwant to say about that in what you have been telling us now, have you? A. Indeed, my lord, yes.Q. These words about the argument being rendered untenable by the pasthistory of telephone tapping; was that your view? A. Never, my lord. It isquite twisted and distorted that Pincher still insists that I brought the &apos; D&apos; noticesalong to prove that they had no application. I did not have to apologise and say I made a mistake on the Thursday. I was off on a story of a somewhat different context, and after I had asked him to explain to me fully what Lawsonhad said he had not mentioned very much ; I think he said on the Thursdayan informant had told him, but he did not give me any details like that, and certainly his story on Thursday was pitiful.Q. You see what I am asking you about. Would you mind looking at yourpoint 8, the third paragraph-&quot; The kindest thing I can say is that the briefingswere not consistent and could not in any circumstances support the contention that I was asked specifically to tackle the Daily Express and Daily Mail on thebasis of the two &apos;D&apos; notices of 27th April, 1956, and 30th October, 1961. Inthe case of the first one, the argument had already been rendered untenable bythe past history of telephone tapping.&quot; Are you not telling us there that the argument that the &apos; D&apos; notice of April, 1956, covered it was untenable becauseof what had already been recognised about telephone tapping? A. Yes, my lord,indeed, but it is one thing to say this to an official like the P.U.S., and it is another thing to admit it to Chapman Pincher. It was Pincher who made greatplay and I wrote this after of course Pincher had made great play about&apos; D&apos; notices which cancelled the telephone tapping aspect on methods and activities. I, think in all fairness, although I have never admitted this to chapman pincher, not once, I swear, it was a good argument. He had a good argument that in fact this was an operation under a warrant which was very similar to telephone tapping, very similar to opening up mail; it was that kind of snooping,as he called it. This view is held not only by Chapman Pincher but by mostpressmen I have spoken to, and most people and pressmen who have writtenabout it have held that view that the &apos;D&apos; notice does not work. I think &quot;un-tenable &quot; is the right expression. As I said orally to the P.U.S., I was skatingon thin ice all the time, and knew it, and I told other people I was skating onthin ice, and they knew it.Q. That means that you went to this meeting with Pincher with your ownmind I think fairly clear that the Press did not understand the April, 1956, &apos; D &apos;notice as covering what Pincher intended to write about; is that wrong? A. Iwent, my lord, with a feeling of great trepidation that I was on. thin ice, thatthis would be interpreted in the way I thought, in fact in the way Chapman
Pincher did interpret it. I had doubts, but I must emphasise that these doubts were not expressed to Pincher ; in no circumstances. I held firmly to what i could for what it was worth until, as I saw quite early on when I used the word&quot; vehement&quot; it did not mean to say we were having a great noisy row, because we were not; you can be vehement quietly. He was quite excited when I started to stick to my guns on this one, so I had to throw them aside ; I had to.Mr. Shinwell: Colonel, in your conversations with the Security Service, theForeign Office people who are named in these depositions, did you gather thatthey relied almost entirely on the &apos;D,&apos; notices, that they applied throughout? A. Yes.Q. There was never any doubt in their minds about it? A. They had noother life raft at all.Q. But in the course of the instructions you received, or the advice youreceived, there were suggestions that you should play them down a bit?-A. Notthe first &apos; D &apos; notice, but certainly they were a little worried that I should pressvery hard on the &apos;D&apos; notice of 31st October; they were worried. The worrywas expressed that this might give away a little bit too much and in fact I donot know whether this has been given to you in evidence the first thing Mr. . . .said on the Tuesday morning when he telephoned me was, &quot; Well, thank God ithas not come out too badly.&quot;Q. So you were really advised to change your tactics? A. To go very easilyon it. There is no change of advice, sir. I was advised to take it very gently,that particular &apos; D &apos; notice, and that was my advice too. They were playing my own advice backwards to me. This went both ways ; we were, one might say,in agreement.Q. So when you went to the lunch on the Monday, although you produced the&apos; D&apos; notices, you still had in your mind this conversation you had had with theSecurity people, and so on? A. Oh yes.Q. That you had not to emphasise the &apos; D&apos; notice aspect too much? A. Ihad not to emphasise too much that it was a security operation. I had to keep it within the formula of defence of the Realm, and I had to play down the foreigncommunications aspect of the second &apos; D &apos; notice.Q----Q. And your request not to write a story was largely based on not infringingsecurity, or not impinging on security ; that is really what it amounted to? A. Indeed, I made great play of this, because I think I am entitled to. Thewhole spirit of that particular &apos; D&apos; notice, the one of 27th April, is aboutsecurity. %Q. You did not convince him at the lunch about this, but subsequently yougathered or at any rate that was your impression that you had convincedhim that he should intercede with his editor not to print the story? A. Sir,on the contrary I thought I had convinced him about it; I really did.Q. At the lunch? A. Yes indeed. I think he admitted as far as he was concerned that I had convinced him. Great security was at stake, real genuinesecurity was very much at stake.Q. And that he would not write the story? A. I got the impression that hewould not write the story.Q. And that was still your impression throughout the evening. Was that thereason why you left for home after 7 o&apos;clock ; you felt that everything was allright? A. This is a very delicate business, about when I go home. I livemiles in the country; I live right out at Charing. They have cut our train service so that the last train is now ridiculously early. I have to make a balance aboutleaving my assistant secretary, Mrs. Marshall, in the office while I get home,knowing what she can cope with and how far she can go ; so I could not stay
up that night, it was quite impossible. If I had stayed up that night it wouldprobably have been worse, because people automatically telephone me at home.There is never a night when I am not telephoned at home. If I have to be upin London I have to do all sorts of convolutions, duty officers to ring, and mywife, to see that messages can get to me, and never going anywhere where thereis not a telephone.Q. Does it amount to this, that in the course of the late afternoon and eveningyou were convinced that you had impressed Chapman Pincher with the importanceof not writing the story? A. When I had spoken to Sir James Dunnett, whowas the last official I spoke to that night, I said, &quot; We are all right. The daily mail is perfectly all right; we are still a little dicey about the Daily Expressbecause they say they have not had an editorial decision &quot;.Q. Sir James Dunnett is your superior, is he? A. Yes, he is my chairman,he is my superior.Q. And having had your conversation with him . . . A. There was nothing else I could do.Q. Was he satisfied with what you said to him? A. Yes. He took it for what it was worth, what I said. I entered the caveat, as I said, that I was stilla little worried about the Express. I was not beaming with enthusiasm about itor overconfident; I was confident that it would go well.Q. He did not suggest further action should be taken, that you ought to remainin town, that this was a matter of considerable importance? He did not saythat? A. Well, he realised it was a matter of considerable importance but hewas satisfied there was nothing more one could do until one had got an editorialdecision.Q. That was your impression at the time? A. Yes, and he then went overto see Sir Burke Trend.Q. May I ask you were you at any time under pressure? That term hasbeen used in the course of the conversations here. Were you under pressure to change your tactics in any way? If I can put it in a rather blunt fashion,were you told by those from whom you had asked advice and who gave youinstructions were you told &quot; Well, this is what you must do &quot;? A. No.Q. Were you not? A. No. One realises that they did not have to impressme with the importance of it. Security is my life&apos;s blood, as it were. Pincherdistorts the facts. He does not explain what the pressure was, you notice.Mr. Pincher&apos;s affairs were not the only things that were happening to me that day. I had Greville Wynne asking me to call a Press conference to explainwhy I was sitting on his latest book, which I wasn&apos;t&apos;t. And there was anotherpublisher wanting advice about a book he had received from Australia whichhad been written by an ex-agent. I was under terrific pressure that day, noloniy about this everything else. And I thought I was going to have an easyday I had not had any leave since I had been in this job and see a localpaper. But I was on the telephone the whole day, the whole of Saturday and nearly the whole of Sunday. And to come into the office to piles of work,apart from this, this was what I meant about pressure not political pressure,of which there never was any.Q. This was one incident among many other things? A. Yes, one of a lot of things.Q. In the course of your conversation with Pincher did you gather from him that there was any political motive in writing the story? A. No. I thinkas far as he was concerned the motive was personal. He has had thispersecution complex and I regret using a psychological term, I don&apos;t knowquite what it means but he has had this persecution complex about his telephonebeing tapped and his letters opened. And it really is quite ludicrous. On one occasion he swore that conversations in this very restaurant were being bugged,as he said.Chairman: We have not got Mr. Pincher here now.-A. But I swear it on myoath.
Q. This is part of his biography-A. This is not his biography, but just to answer Mr. ShinwelFs point. I do not think he was that sort of animal. It waspersonal.Mr. Shinwell: You suggest he had a personal motive, because his privacyhad been invaded. I think you were present when the question was put tohim by myself whether he had taken this attitude of wanting to write the storybecause his privacy was being invaded, and he denied that. A. Well, he mayhave done. I can only give you my impression. I know him fairly well, andthis is something which does irritate the life out of him, and this is what he wasvehement about.Q. You have had a long friendship with Chapman Pincher? A. Yes.Q. Has any difficulty of this sort been experienced with him before? A. Yes.He said about the photograph of the last DG of MI.5 he made it sound as though he just agreed when I said No to this. As a matter of fact it was avery hard fight over several days before he finally agreed he would not have this wretched photograph with the caption accompanying his little article. Ihad terrible fights with him over the exchange of Wynne for the Russian spy,where he complained to my chairman that I had in fact followed him about allnight and got in his way. I have had a number of ups and downs with him,quite a number of stern fights almost, over security. But in the end he did seesense.Q. Is he the defence correspondent for the Express? A. He is the defence and science correspondent.Q. He deals mainly with matters of security, does he? A. Well, he thinksof himself as a great security expert all spy cases are generally through him.He is what is known as a specialist; he is an assistant editor and a specialist.And he has a little team that works under him, they report to him and writefor him.   And if there is a story he likes he will do it up on his own.Q. I want to put a final question to you, Colonel Lohan. Did you at anytime in your conversation with the security people, Foreign Office, your superiors,experience any difficulty about the instructions you received? A. No. Do Iunderstand you aright? Do you mean the case where I threw my hands up indespair and said &quot;No, this cannot be done&quot;?Q. No. A. I realised there were difficulties, so did they, but at no time didI throw my hands up and say &quot; This is not on &quot;.Q. They did not want you to tell the full story?-A. No. The underliningwas that one had to be very very careful. And in any case if they hadnot briefed that into me I would have briefed it into them. If someone had said &quot;Would it not be a good idea to take Chapman Pincher aside and tell him everything completely frankly?&quot; I would have said No.Q. Would you have regarded the story of this as grave and embarrassing? A. I would not have said embarrassing. This is not the ^political impression. Ithink this is a grave thing. The job of our security service and intelligence ser-vice, secret service, is probably the most difficult in the world, and for anybodyto do anything which denigrates them or makes their lives more difficult, or totip anybody off, I think is shocking and irresponsible ; this is what I said toPincher.Q. Do you think those who advised you or instructed you or discussed thesematters with you about the publication of the story were justified in regardingit as a very grave matter? A. Absolutely.Q. Had you any previous difficulty with your superiors in matters of this sort? A. Well, there is the famous case of Anatoli Dolnytsin, which I have mentioned before, where I was a reluctant dragon in the case.Q. But no similar case? A. Where I did something which I did not agree withbecause I was duty bound? No, my superiors are remarkably understanding they are remarkably understanding. When I say my superiors, this is Sir JamesDunnetfs first experience, he has been in the Chair only a few months ; it is veryunfair on him, because he is terribly busy, to have this thrown at himout of the blue, it is quite awful.
Q. There has been a conflict of evidence, Colonel. How do you account forthe conflict of evidence between that which you have given and that of chapman pincher?-A. The conflict struck me more that the whole of the evidence of the express group was contrived. For example, take this silly business of whattrain I was going to catch I did not know which train I was going tocatch. ..Chairman: Colonel Lohan, you are a witness who has given evidence about what passed in the presence of the Express people. I do not think it altogetherproper that you should come here now and say their story is contrived. Youare only a witness. A. I beg your pardon, but I thought my opinion was being sought.Q. I do not think it is very satisfactory. A. I do beg your pardon, but thiswas in answer to Mr. Shinwell.Mr. Shinwell: I withdraw that question.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: At the very beginning, a remark which interested me, aboutthe press officer of the Ministry of Defence getting in touch with you. A. Yes,he did not.Q. Would you have expected him to? A. Yes, very much so.Q. Because he has given evidence that on Thursday afternoon Mr. Pinchersaid that he had heard that cables were collected from cable offices in london by van I think he said M.P.B.W. van and taken to a Ministry of Defence build-ing where they were kept for a period of, I think it was forty-eight hours, and afterwards returned to the cable offices. He did not tell you that? A. No, he never spoke to me.Q. Do you think he ought to have done? -A. Yes indeed.Q. Supposing he had told you that on Thursday? A. If he had told me justthat bit more I should probably have thought more about it myself. This is whyI asked Chapman Pincher to go to the Ministry of Defence, because if therewas something in it the Ministry of Defence, I would expect, would &apos;phoneme back.Q. And leaving aside whether Chapman Pincher spoke to you first, they didnot communicate with you? A. No, not at all.Q. ...Q. About the instructions you received, you say in this memorandum, &quot; Iacted to the best of my ability on all advice given. This was plentiful and some-what contradictory &quot;? A. YesQ. You boiled it down very concisely . . . What did you mean by &apos; plentiful&apos;? A. There were many conversations. Lord Radcliffe has said that there was atleast one, but there were more than one from each person, many more than one,on the Monday. I had people on to me on Sunday. &apos; I had people on to meon the Friday. So over a period there were a lot.Q. Were they plugging their own point of view? Was each department com-ing back again and again saying &quot; Whatever you do do not refer to the aspectwe do not want referred to &quot;? A. I would not put it as brutally as that, no.One could say that each one was selfish in one sense.Q. But you knew there had been an interdepartmental meeting, did you not? A. One thing I did know for certain was that M.I.5 had met Ewart-Biggs. i must say I was a little surprised that I was not invited to the interdepartmentalmeeting.Q. Were you in London on Friday? A. No, but I could have come up at any moment. I could have been there in an hour and a quarter.Q. This went on all over the weekend? A. Yes, indeed.Q. Up to lunchtime on Monday? A. Yes, many telephone calls in and out.Q. I am still not quite clear myself about the skating on very thin ice. you said when you were giving evidence dealing with Chapman Pincher:
&quot; He maintained this view so hard about this being equivalent to tele-phone tapping that I almost gave up in despair and said &apos;A11 right, let us go back to the other one&apos; and we referred to this one of 1961. Well, Ishall have to reserve certain remarks I made about this myself, but on the face of it it was a difficult one to push. One was skating on extremely thinice.&quot;And then you said again when you went to see Mr. Chapman Pincher you told him you were skating on very thin ice. A. I meant in the case as it happened,that the moment I brought the words into play of those of two &apos; D&apos; noticesit immediately started an argument about the words themselves, not asmuch about the meaning but about the words. And one can see a lot of people agree with Pincher on this, that the words do not have any application in this particular case.Q. You said in your minute of 22nd February referring to this secondnotice that any emphasis would disclose to Chapman Pincher the true natureof the operation. A. Yes.Q. When you talked to him about pattern of signatures, and so on, a pattern of code in plain language is that not disclosing the nature of the operation? A. Some of it. But I should have thought from a journalises point of view, andI had to look at it from his point of view, what they like is where the thinggoes; they like to involve the departments, the addresses, the possibility of photographs, what are the procedures, what apparatus is used. This is what Iwished to avoid. And this is what they like to use in a story. Journalists look at these, things slightly different from the way we do, and that is the sort of thing they are after all the time. ..Chairman: There is only one question arising out of that. I sympathisevery much with your difficulties of having various departments putting theirpoints of view to you about this. But is it wrong to think that the last call onMonday which Mr. Ewart-Biggs made to you was on the lines that this co-ordinated the Governments view? Did you not get that impression? A. No.I had no reason to think about the word &apos; co-ordinate&apos;. I thought he was repre-senting the person most interested, the major user, as it were, and therefore thatwas a co-ordinated view.Q. Yes, I think he may have had that view himself. The only other thing,Colonel Lohan, is at the end of your aide memoire, you have two or threeparagraphs on the lessons to be learnt, which would be relevant to the second part of our Inquiry as to whether there is anything one can do to help improvethis system. Will Sir James Dunnett discuss this when we see him? A. Yes, Ithink it is right and proper he should do that.Q. You are briefing him? A. We had a meeting of the committee todiscuss this. I have dictated the minutes. And he will have had something like this to go on.Q. So if we see you again it will be with him? A. If he wishes to haveme there.Chairman: Thank you.(The witness withdrew.)(The proceedings were adjourned until Tuesday, 21st March, 1967)

GreigEditor, Daily ExpressEditor, Daily TelegraphEditorEditorial Director1Daily MirrorJChairman of Services, Press and Broad-casting CommitteeDeputy Under-Secretary of State (Admin.),Ministry of DefenceAssistant Under-Secretary of State (Per-sonnel) Defence Secretariat)representing Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd.,-  the senior executives of the Daily Expressand Mr. Chapman PincherEvidence of Mr. Derek Marks resumedSir Peter Rawlinson: We had really reached the end of the evening of the20th with Mr. Marks when we adjourned last, which is page 11 of his statement.There are just two matters to clarify on the happenings of Monday evening, Mr.Marks. Was this the actual memorandum which Mr. Peter Johnson handed toyou when you got to the office, the memorandum that he had made of his con-versation with Colonel Lohan just before you got to the office? A. That is right.Chairman: What is it?  Shall we have it read?Sir Peter Rawlinson: The memorandum reads:  &quot;From Peter Johnson 20th February, 1967.to Mr. Derek MarksFor the record, Colonel Lohan telephoned tonight at 9.38 p.m. He askedfor you by name. I said that, unfortunately, you could not be contacted,and that I was in charge. He asked if it was too late to stop the cable vetting story going in. I said that it was, and that in fact Glasgow had gone to press, that Manchester was about to go to press, and that we should beto press within about 20 minutes. His aim, he said, was to ask us to hold it24 hours while he made inquiries. When he realised this was impossible,-he accepted the fact, adding that it was &apos; very sad&apos;.&quot;
Then over the page:&quot; The press times of Manchester and Glasgow on which I was working 1in my conversation with Lohan were based on their planned times as givenme earlier in the night by Hodgson and McColl.&quot;They are up in . . .? A. Hodgson is deputy editor in Manchester, and McCollis editor in Glasgow.Q. Then:&quot; In fact Manchester went to press at 10.31 off the stone, and Glasgowwent to press at about 9.45 and were running at 10.7.&quot;&quot; Running at 10.7 &quot; Would you explain that? A. That means the paper actuallycoming off the machine.Chairman: How soon is it known in London what are the contents of the glasgow edition of the Express! A. In detail, not until the following day.By and large they would follow the pattern which I think I explained last time,which we follow, and they have a great deal of autonomy up there. They couldwell have a great deal of material in the paper which is not in the Londonedition, or indeed which is not sent to London at all.Q. How soon does it get to the other newspapers in London, what has appeared in the Glasgow edition of the Express? A. From there they would get the firstedition from our Glasgow office within ten minutes or fifteen minutes of the runstarting.Q. The offices in Glasgow would have the first distribution of what is comingoff?-A. Yes.Q. And so if there is anything then which strikes them as important, theywould send it through on their own private wire to London? A. Yes.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: When you say running at 10.7 that is coming off the printing machine? A. Yes.Q. How soon is it before it is being sold? A. Fairly rapidly in Glasgow,because they sell at night, the same night, and they have distribution round thehotels which you do not have in London or in Manchester.  -Sir Peter Rawlinson: As you have been speaking of Mr. McColl up in glasgow, you told the committee he has considerable autonomy. Then afteryou got the message from Sir Max from the Garrick Club you immediately infact telephoned to Mr. McColl. A. That is correct.Q. When you say he had autonomy, would it have been possible that hecould have run a story which might have been subject to &apos; D &apos; notice, or some-thing like that? A. Yes, indeed. He could in my view anyway have got holdof the story. My first reaction when I heard the word Glasgow mentioned wasthat he had got hold of some sort of story about the Polaris base, or something ofthat order, which he might have thought of local interest, and not necessarily have sent to London.Q. That is possible?-A. Yes, indeed.Q. Can I come now to page 11 of your proof, and that is coming to 21stFebruary. Were you in the course of the afternoon shown a report from theproceedings of the House of Commons, that in answer to a question on &apos;D&apos;notices the Prime Minister has said, &quot; A clear breach of two &apos; D&apos; notices, despite the fact that the newspaper concerned was repeatedly warned that it would becontravening the notice . A. Yes, indeed.Q. What did you do shortly after you had seen that report, or what happened? A. Chapman Pincher telephoned me and said that he had spoken to colonel lohan and obtained his permission to disclose what had passed between them.Q. As a result of that was there published in the Daily Express written ofcourse&apos; that night and published the next day, which was Wednesday, 22ndFebruary-a story by Mr. Chapman Pincher under the heading &quot;A chargerefuted &quot;?-A. Yes.         &apos;-&apos;
Q. Gn that day after that had appeared on Wednesday 22nd, did colonel lohan speak to you on the telephone? A. Yes, he called me at the office, andhe said he would either like to speak to me on the telephone or come and see me,and I suggested it would be better if he came round to my office, and he gotthere about twenty, past six.Q. When he came to your office at 6.20, what did he say? A. He said hehad come to make two points basically, that he had maintained categorically thathe had told Chapman Pincher on the Thursday that the &apos; D &apos; notice did notapply. He said that in later conversations with Pincher he said in his view thematter could be claimed to be under &apos; D&apos; notice, but that it was a perfectlytenable view, as had been put forward in fact by the Times on that day,Wednesday 22nd, that it was not. Therefore he had argued with Pincher onthe Monday on the basis of putting the &apos; D&apos; notices on one side, and that wasthe word he used.Chairman: Is this your own recollection? You have not got a note made atthe time? A. I have not a note at the time, but I put it down shortly afterwards.Q. When did you make a note of this?- A. Within 24 to 48 hours.Sir Peter Rawlinson: He said a tenable view as expressed in The Times wasto the effect that it was reasonable for the Express to dispute,that, that the &apos;D&apos;notice applied? A. Correct.Q. Go on then, Mr. Marks. A. I asked Colonel Lohan if he had any objec-tions whatever to the story being published that morning by Chapman Pincher.Q. That is &quot; A charge refuted &quot; story? A. Yes. It was on the top, it being that day&apos;s paper, the top copy of the file in my office, and Colonel Lohan movedacross to it, looked at it, and said that he did not quite accept the view expressed in the paragraph, I think number 3, in the story.Q. That is the third paragraph which deals with the two hours Pincher spentwith Colonel Lohan on the Monday afternoon when Colonel Lohan had pro-duced the two &apos; D &apos; notices that could conceivably be relevant, and Pincher wroteLohan agreed neither could reasonably be applied to the matter in question. A.Correct.Q. What did Colonel Lohan say? A. Colonel Lohan said obviously they had some application but that he had put them on one side in argument withPincher since a contrary view could just as well be maintained. He added that asfar as paragraph 4 was concerned he would have preferred that Pincher could have said that he used all his powers of persuasion in the spirit of the &apos; D&apos;notices.Q. &quot; Used all his powers of persuasion &quot; but had not said &quot; in the spirit of the&apos; D &apos; notices &quot; which Lohan would have liked to have been put in. A. Yes.Q. Apart from those two points, had he any complaints about the Pincher articleon Wednesday? A. None at all.Q. Did he say anything about whether he had or had not prepared the originalanswer to the Parliamentary Question? A. Yes, he said that he had prepare the original answer for the Prime Minister to Sir John Langford Holfs question,but he had not been consulted about the reference which had been made to the daily Express which had been tacked on the end, and he did not agree with it.He added that it was wrong that anyone else should intervene on a &apos; D &apos; notice question as he was the channel between the &apos; D&apos; Notice Committee and thePress.Q. I think you then had some further conversations, not really relevant, andthen he left your office? A. That is correct.Q. Is that really the whole part that you played in the circumstances leading up to this publication? A. That is correct.Q. Could I ask you now just four general questions. Before your talk withLohan on the telephone at about eleven o&apos;clock that evening when you had comeback to the office from the Garrick Club, had you received any warning that the story was under &apos;D&apos; notice? A. None at all.
Q. Can you say, if you had been told before publication that the story wasunder &apos; D &apos; notice, would you have published? A. If I had been told the storywas under &apos; D &apos; notice before it came anywhere near publication, I think I shouldhave wanted to argue the question with Colonel Lohan personally.Chairman: Whether it was under &apos; D &apos; notice? A. Exactly.Sir Peter Rawlinson: We have had a view expressed by Mr. Brittenden that where &apos; D &apos; notices are laid aside a personal request from Colonel Lohan istantamount to a &apos; D&apos; notice. Is that your interpretation of the system, or not? A. No, it cannot be. It cannot be the same thing at all.Q. Why do you say it cannot be the same? A; Because the whole of the &apos; D &apos;notice system has no legal force. If I may enlarge on this, I do not understandthis talk about the spirit of the &apos; D &apos; notice system. &apos; D &apos; notices are in factithe embodiment of the &apos; D&apos; notice system, and they represent the free co-operation between the Government and the service Ministries on the one hand,and the Press on the other, and you cannot build and enlarge upon that. Obviouslywe seek guidance from Colonel Lohan whether something does in fact infringe&apos; D&apos; notices, and we would, for example, if he had said there was a specialoperation involved, clearly we would not have published this story. Not only would it have been wrong to do so, but because it would equally have infringeda &apos; D &apos; notice.Q. Did you believe that you had a discretion for you to exercise when therehad been &apos; D&apos; notices laid aside but Colonel Lohan had made any request? A.Most certainly.Chairman: I have one or two questions. We know now from what you havetold us you knew nothing of this cable vetting story until just before six o&apos;clockon the Monday? A. Correct.Q. Mr. Pincher came to you with the story, but not with it written out? A.Correct.Q. Apart from your editorial experience, you yourself had been a defencecorrespondent in the past, I gather? A. Yes, sir.Q. When you first heard about the nature of the story, did it seem to you to have a possible &apos; D &apos; notice application? A. Yes, indeed.Q. Your mind was brought on to it right away as soon as you heard the natureof it? A. It was brought on in this way, that Mr. Pincher said that he had discussed it with Colonel Lohan and there was no &apos; D &apos; notice application, and Iwanted to know if he was sure, and he assured me this was certainly so.Q. It was not only that Chapman Pincher said to you that with regard to this story Lohan said that definitely it is not within the &apos; D&apos; notice. It struck yourmind as being a possible &apos; D &apos; notice question. A. Yes.Q. If you look at page 2 of the memorandum which you gave us, the &apos; D&apos;notice point does seem to occur again and again in your exchanges with Mr.Pincher. A. Certainly.Q. First of all, he had received a categoric assurance that it was not within1 D &apos; notices, and that is the first new paragraph there. Then in the third para-graph, &quot; He said that Colonel Lohan had brought all&apos; D &apos; notices that might applyalong with him. He had pointed to them and said that none applied.&quot; then in the next paragraph, &quot; Pincher assured me that. Lohan had agreed that the &apos; D &apos;notices did not apply . . .&quot; etc. Then after all that you asked him to put hisstory into writing. A. Yes, sir.Q. What was the purpose of that, to see whether it could be thought to have&apos; D &apos; notice application? A. No, sir, the purpose was simply that it is far easier to assess a story in writing, than it is when you are talking about it, and you have a potential copy in front of you.Q. You did not want it in writing to see whether it was what I call a goodstory?- A. No.Q. You wanted to see how it looked from the point of view of the &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Quite honestly it was not. I was looking at it then from the point of viewof the story, because I had been assured the &apos; D &apos; notice did not apply.
Q. You are quite clear about that? A. I am quite clear about that.Q. When you had got it into writing, through Pincher I think he brought it back to you it was then that the Legal Manager, Mr. Andrew Edwards, came intothe picture, did he not? A. Yes.Q. And he had a copy of the written story? A. Yes, sir.Q. What did you want the legal manager to look at it for? A. First of all,just to run an eye through it to see that all was well on the story as a whole, andhe takes a rather different view from the journalist on any story we are running,and also I wanted my deputy to make the point of the Official Secrets Act, andthat was the point which the legal manager settled, he brought a copy of theOfficial Secrets Act with him and pointed to the relevant paragraph.Q. I appreciate that there was what I might call a separate point about theOfficial Secrets Act being involved, but did you ask him his view about itsrelationship to &apos;D &apos; notices? A. I did not.Q. If he knows about them.-A. No.Q. Did he express a view? A. No, sir.Q. At the meeting Mr. Pincher again seems to have brought in the point that colonel Lohan had agreed the story was not covered by &apos; D &apos; notices. A. I think the purpose was that both I and my deputy were going out, and the night Editorwas going to take charge of the paper, and it was essential that he should be fully in the picture as to what the situation was.Q. But I thought your basis was &quot; Well, the &apos; D &apos; notice is really out of the picture because it has been cleared with Colonel Lohan &quot;? A. Exactiy, butit was important the night Editor should be aware that that was the case.Q. Did you think he might be approached then?-A. No, I had no ideawhether he would be or not, on the basis of the.&apos; D &apos; notice I did not think hecould be, but I thought there might be some pressure when it was known wewere publishing, yes.Q. Then at the top of page 4 of your statement you say:  &quot; When the story had been rewritten. . . .&quot;and that rewriting I think partly consisted of putting in your reference to theOfficial Secrets Act, section 4 &quot;... the managing Editor, the night Editor, Chapman Pincher and myselfagain went through it. Again Chapman Pincher said that Colonel Lohanwas quite categoric that it was not covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice.&quot;I do not quite follow why there is this insistent return to this point about &apos; D &apos;notices if it was thought to be quite clear.-A. This was the first time the nightEditor had heard about the story, and just so that he should be in the pictureagain I then said to Mr. Pincher, &quot; Now there is no doubt that this was clearedas far as the &apos; D&apos; notice was concerned by Colonel Lohan &quot; so that if anythingarose while I was out of the office, whatever else the situation was, the nightEditor would be fully seized of the fact that the story had been cleared as far as&apos; D &apos; notices were concerned.Q. With that having gone through, you left to go to the dinner at the GarrickClub for Trevor Evans. A. Yes.Q. Then you tell us that Sir Max was called out of the room to the telephone,he left the dining room, he went to the telephone box and came back to you ;and he made it plain to you I gather at least that there was some complaintfrom the Foreign Secretary about what the Express was doing? A. Yes, sir.Q. I think he referred to the Glasgow edition in your recollection? A. Withinmy recollection Sir Max said the Foreign Secretary had said that we were running some story in Glasgow which was under &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. What puzzles me, I will tell you quite frankly, about this part of yourevidence is until an hour or two ago you had been having this session in theoffice in which plainly the &apos; D&apos; notice question on the cable vetting story wasvery much to the fore in spite of all the assurances Mr. Pincher had been giving,
and yet you did not think of it when you heard of the complaint that the foreign secretary was making. A. Quite honestly I did not think may be I shouldhave been quicker off the mark I did not think the Foreign Secretary hadanything to do with &apos;D&apos; notices, and he had specified Scotland. Had he saidwe were running in London my mind would at once have jumped to it, and Iwas put off there by the reference to Glasgow, and it was a matter of secondswhile I had gone through to Glasgow and on to London.Q. I quite see the point about Glasgow, but it is in a sense only your firstedition, it is the first bit of the Express containing the main part of its contentsfor the morning that comes out. A. Yes.Q. That is what Glasgow can mean, and need not necessarily mean a localform of story you had not heard about. A. No, but I could not see why thereshould be a specific reference to Glasgow.Q. It is the first way the public can learn what the Express is going to printthe next day. A. I am sorry, sir, no, that is not always the case. Forexample, that night I did not know Glasgow was going first. The order in whichthe various centres go changes from night to night.Q. I did not know that.   It is not regularly the first? A. By no means.Q. The other thing I want you to be very clear in your recollection of sinceyou had no instantaneous record is what passed between Colonel Lohan and you on the Wednesday when he came to see you. I do not know that thereis very much difference between your two accounts of it, but are you perfectly clear in your mind that he used these phrases that you produce to us in youraide memoire on pages 12 and 13:  &quot; He declared that in later conversations with Pincher he had said in his view the matter could be claimed to be under &apos; D&apos; notice but that it wasa perfecdy tenable view . . . that it was not&quot;.You recall that with perfect clarity? A. Yes, sir.You say:  &quot; Therefore he had argued with Pincher on the Monday on the basisof &apos; putting the &apos; D &apos; notices on one side&apos;.&quot;-A. Yes, sir.Q. That phrase may be significant, I do not know, but that sticks in yourmind? A. It did indeed.Q. You repeated it on the next page:  &quot;... but that he had put them on one side in argument with Pincher since a contrary view could just as well be maintained &quot;.-A. Yes.Mr. Shinwell: After you were informed by Mr. Chapman Pincher about thestories, you were quite clear that the &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply? A. Yes, sir.Q. At no time had you any doubts about this? A. No, sir.Q. In your evidence you say that it was obvious the Government did not want you to print it? A. Yes, sir.Q. Were you influenced by this at all? A. Influenced to the extent that one has obviously to consider a request from Colonel Lohan that one should not carry a story.Q. You were also aware that the Foreign Secretary had approached Sir MaxAitken? A. Not before publication, sir.Q. But did not the Foreign Secretary speak to Sir Max Aitken when he was at the Garrick Club dinner round about ten o&apos;clock? A. Ten past ten.Q. But by that time the story had appeared in the Glasgow edition, am right? A. Yes, sir.Q. You had no influence as regards the publication of the story in the glasgow edition? A. Not at that time, no, sir.
Q. On page 4 you give your reasons why you decided to publish the story, andNo. 2 states that one of the reasons was the categorical assurance that no breach of a &apos; D &apos; notice was involved. What other reason had you for printing? A.I do not quite follow. The reason I had for printing was that it was a storyof major news interest.Q. You were quite clear in your own mind after you had heard about this story that the &apos; D&apos; notice did not apply, and nevertheless you decided to go ahead.  Why? A. Because it was an important and significant news story.Q. You were not in any way influenced by any representations made to youby Colonel Lohan who did suggest correct me if I am wrong who did suggeston more than one occasion to Mr. Chapman Pincher that it was a matter of security. A. That is correct, sir.Q. And are you not influenced by matters of security? A. Obviously sir,I think any responsible person is influenced by matters of security, but equallyif one is editing a paper one has to be on one&apos;s guard against matters of securitybeing used to hush up a thing which a Government does not want to get out,and the same thing would apply if we discovered mail in the country was beingcensored.Q. The Foreign Secretary phoned Sir Max Aitken round about ten to10.15 on the night of the 20th. According to your statement he apparently didnot know what Mr. Brown was talking about? A. Correct.Q. You were at the dinner? A. Yes, sir.Q. Did he speak to you about it? A. About the telephone call?Q. Yes. Did he not say to you, &quot; The Foreign Secretary has been on the phoneand is telling me some story, and I do not know what it is all about&quot;? A.That I have recorded in my evidence.   That is exacfly what he did do.Q. That he did not know what it was about. Did you know what it wasabout?-A. I did not know, otherwise I would not immediately havetelephoned Glasgow.Q. Even at 10.15 you did not know that this matter of the story was underconsideration? A. I was well aware that the story had been printed in Glasgow,and I was not aware that the Foreign Secretary was interested himself in a storyand had come on the phone to say to Sir Max &quot;You are printing a story fromGlasgow which is under &apos; D &apos; notice &quot;.Q. But Sir Max told you the Foreign Secretary had spoken to him on the telephone? A. Yes.Q. And he did not know what it was about? A. Yes, sir.Q. Would you be good enough to look at your evidence on page 7 where you say that you were quite certain that the only undertaking given by SirMax to the Foreign Office was that if the story was under &apos; D&apos; notice it wouldbe stopped. A. Yes, sir.Q. Sir Max Aitken was not aware of what the Foreign Secretary was talkingabout? A. The answer to that is simply that if we were running any story under&apos; D &apos; notice we would clearly take it out, whatever the story was.Q. Only it had already appeared of course. A. If we were, running a storyunder &apos; D &apos; notice, we would take it out.Q. Is there much point in taking it out after it appeared in one of theeditions? A. That was a request from the Foreign Secretary.Q. What is your view about it? A. I do not think there is much point intaking it out.Q. You did take it out? A. I was prepared to take it out.Q. You were prepared to take it out? A. Yes, sir.Q. Why? A. Because Sir Max had said to the Foreign Secretary that if itwas under &apos; D&apos; notice we would take it out.
Q. It was only because of the statement made by Sir Max that if the &apos; D&apos;notice applied it would be taken out, and it was because of that you wereprepared to take it out? A. Yes, sir.Q. You did not take it out? A. No, sir.Q. Throughout the whole of this affair, Mr. Chapman Pincher indicated in conversations, prolonged conversations, repeated conversations from Thursdayuntil Monday, at lunch and all the rest of it, and your deputy editor, I thinkMr. Johnson, had been informed by Mr. Chapman Pincher about it, and the representations made by Colonel Lohan on frequent occasions, almost pleadingthat the story should not be published; in addition to which the foreign secretary phoned Sir Max Aitken, and obviously the Foreign Secretary-you may not agree with me would not have phoned Sir Max Aitken unless he regarded it as a matter of considerable importance but you decided togo ahead? A. As far as the conversations that Mr. Pincher had with colonel lohan are concerned, he would naturally conduct this and hear him outuntil he reached a conclusion before saying anything to anybody, and then he mentioned it to me, quite properly, and my deputy, in fact Mr. Raybould,and Mr. Johnson is the night Editor, they were informed immediatelyafter I had been informed. Obviously we attached, or I attached, because itis my responsibility, importance to what Colonel Lohan had to say. EquallyI must say again one has to consider why a plea of national security has beenmade for something which is not covered by the &apos; D&apos; notices, and one is driven to the conclusion that it was something which the Government for its own reasonswished to keep quiet.Q. Within your knowledge, Mr. Marks, which is considerable we all know,have you ever know of an occasion when there were some doubts as to whetherthe &apos; D &apos; notice could apply to any particular affair, any incident, but at thesuggestion of the Government of the day your attention was directed to a possibleinfringement of security, and a newspaper decided not to publish? A. not within my personal experience.Q. You have never known of it? A. Not within my personal experience, no.Q. Is it a possibility? A. I should think so, yes.Q. Had you any other motive for proceeding? A. None at all. My motivefor proceeding was simply that this was obviously a matter of major public importance which should be printed, and that is the responsibility one has to carry.Q. Do you consider that cable vetting is a matter of public importance? A. Yes, sir, exactly the same way as I consider the opening of mails as of public importance.Q. Why? A. Because these are private and personal communications.Q. It is an invasion of privacy? A. Exactly.         &apos;*Q. Had you any complaints at any time that this was an invasion of privacy?-A. No, sir.Q. From an industrial firm? A. No, sir.Q. From any individual? A. No, sir.Q. Any letters to the editor? A. No, sir.Q. And yet you proceeded to publish. You regarded it as a matter of profoundimportance? A. Yes, sir.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Mr. Marks, do you think the &apos; D&apos; notice system workswell? A. On the whole I think it works very well indeed.Q. You would always feel that you could argue whether a particular &apos; D&apos;notice applied or not? A. Certainly.Q. Would you take Mr. Chapman Pincher, if he said that he was satisfied itapplied . . . A. I think Mr. Pincher and I would most probably have agreed on what one is arguing about and where there is no case to argue.Q. If you felt that it was being contended by Colonel Lohan that &apos; D &apos; noticesapplied and you did not agree, you would argue with him? A. Indeed,
Q. What I do not quite understand is what happens when strong pressure isi exercised. Does that frequently happen, that strong pressure is exercised to try to persuade you not to use a story? A. From whom?Q. Mr. Pincher told you that Lohan had agreed the &apos; D &apos; notices did not apply,but he, Colonel Lohan, was under very strong pressure to persuade you not touse the story. A. No.Q. Does that frequently happen that strong pressure is exercised apart fromthe &apos; D &apos; notices?-A. Not overtly, no, sir, not on these sort of matters.Q. I can remember the days of the diplomatic correspondent when there mightbe news where the Foreign Office did not particularly want stories to be emphasised and you would be asked not to. Does that happen with thesedefence stories? A. It happens quite a lot in all fields. To give you one recent example, when they recently moved the headquarters of the Metropolitan police in New Scotland Yard to Victoria Street, the Commissioner did not want thatmove to be publicised beforehand. It must have been apparent to any crookin London who was interested that it was going on because you cannot carryout an operation of that scale in secrecy, but nonetheless no one reported it, andit was a perfectly reasonable and legitimate request for us not to report something.Q. And Government Departments do from time to time ask the press not todo things? A. Particularly the police.Q. You would regard it as within your discretion to decide whether to accede to such a request or not? A. Oh, certainly.Q. And you looked upon this pressure that Colonel Lohan was exerting as amatter about which you really had discretion? A. Indeed.Q. Is that really satisfactory? Do you think there ought to be some greaterformality, if a Government department wants something not to be published on general grounds do you think it ought to be formalised in some way? A. Youwill then at once postulate a censorship of the press.Q. Would it be possible to have some extension of the role of this voluntarycommittee to deal with this kind of request? A. I think they could give theirendorsement to the request, but I think if we are going to continue to have a free society it must remain a request, and we cannot have Government depart-ments telling newspapers what they shall or shall not write.Q. I quite accept that, but I was wondering whether there was any improvementin this machinery possible, because the sort of phrase &quot; under strong pressure to persuade you not to use the story &quot; seems a very vague situation. Do you think it would be possible to extend the work of this committee in some way tocover a case which was not strictly within the &apos; D&apos; notices? A. I think, sir,that if Colonel Lohan had really wanted to invoke the &apos; D&apos; notice he could have tried to get the help of a couple of press members of the &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee,and persuade them that it applied. We would at once on this one have argued that it did not apply.Q. I am really exploring this on your version.   Colonel Lohan was layingthem on one side and trying to persuade on general grounds? A. Yes.Q. Do you think there is any scope for an extension of this, voluntary com-mittee, that when there is a feeling something ought to be stopped on general grounds it could be handled through this committee? A. It would depend uponthe speed with which action was necessary. Obviously they can always call thecommittee in and get the committee to endorse the advice, but as we standnow Chairman: I think this is very important to us. &quot; Endorse the advice &quot; could take the form of adding that the press representatives sent a new &apos; D&apos; noticeout 01 sending out a special notice that they regarded the existing &apos; D&apos; noticeas covering it? A. Either way, a new &apos; D&apos; notice, or saying that the existing&apos; D &apos; notice is held to cover this particular activity.Q. And that would involve getting hold of two or three press representatives on the committee, and getting them to agree if they would? A. Yes. it would.
Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: With regard to die move of Scotland Yard, no newspaperreported that? A. None at all. IQ. How was that arranged? A. Because the Commissioner of Police sent anote round asking us not to report it.Q. How did you know other papers were not going to? A. First of all, ifanyone else did do, and it is not the sort of thing one would violate in any way,but I was quite certain the others would not because the Commissioner of Policeis very reasonable in what he asks, and he has probably to make more requeststo us than anybody else, and he always couches them very civilly and takes thegreatest pains to see we are informed as soon as it is lifted.Q. That happens without any machinery at all? A. That happens without anymachinery at all other than a confidential message from the Commissioner ofPolice to the editors of all papers.Re-examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. You were asked, Mr. Marks, about this story generally, and the interferencewith privacy and liberty. I am going to read you some words from a reportof a Committee of Privy Councillors ten years ago to see if you agree with them or not:  &quot; There is no doubt that the interception of communications, whether by theopening or reading of letters of telegrams, or by listening to any recordingconversations, is regarded with general disfavour.&quot;Is that your view? A. Certainly it is.Q. Were those Privy Councillors correct? A. Certainly.Q. I think there was a reservation by Mr. Gordon Walker, who was one ofthe Privy Councillors, which read:  &quot; Public repugnance to the interception of communications has, it seemsto me, increased and there should therefore be a further restriction upon theuse of this power for the purposes of the detection of crime.&quot;dealing with crime. Do you think that? A. I do indeed.Q. When you had to consider this particular story, quite apart from thesecurity element in it, did there seem to you to be other elements which were of importance as well as the security element? A. Yes. I have already said there had been recently quite a row about telephone tapping, which was freshin the minds of people, and obviously no Government likes to have things stirredup immediately after one row of this nature.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Finally, Mr. Marks, you were asked, you remember,about why you turned as it were straight away to Glasgow after Sir Max had said the word &quot; Glasgow &quot; to you. You said something about Polaris straightaway? A. Yes.Chairman: Thank you.(The witness withdrew)Sir Max Aitken called examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. Are you the Chairman of the Board of Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd? A.Yes, I am.Q. On the evening of Monday 20th February, were you at a dinner at theGarrick Club in honour of Trevor Evans, who has been one of the labour corres-coorespondents of the group for many years? A. That is correct.Q. And was also Mr. Marks present? A. Yes.
Q. Were you sitting near to Mr. Marks?-A. I should think-he was on mypght, seven or eight away.Q. Had you seen Mr. Marks and spoken to Mr. Marks before the dinner? A. No, only to say I arrived just as he arrived and I said hello.Q. Had you any idea while you sat at dinner and had your dinner that evening and listened to speeches, had you any idea of the story which was subsequentlypublished in the Express about cable vetting?-A. No, none.Q. At some time were you called to the telephone? First of all, at what time? A. It must have been about 10 to 10.15.Q. You were called to the telephone. What was said to you when you were so called? A. I got a message saying Mr. George Brown wished to speak to meon the telephone, and so I left the dining room, and I thought that there wouldbe someone to show me to a box, but I could not find anyone and I went down tothe porter&apos;s box on the ground floor, and asked where Mr. George Brown wasringing from, and they did not know. So I rang the Daily Express and saiddid they know of a call from Mr. George Brown, and they said Yes, he was on theline and had been hanging on the line.Q. Did you speak to Mr. Brown? A. Yes. I said &quot; Can you put me through? &quot;,and they did.Q. What was said, in your own words, when you were connected? A. Wesaid Hello to each other in a pleasant way, and then he said he wanted to discuss with me a story that was running in our Glasgow edition, and that was under a&apos; D&apos; notice. Then he said he wished I would do something about it, and take it out. I said that I did not know anything about the story, but if the story wasunder a &apos; D &apos; notice I would certainly have it taken out.Q. Did you say anything about anybody on the staff of the newspaper? &apos;A. I said that Derek Marks was with me and I would speak to him immediately.Q. You were speaking, you say, from the porter&apos;s box? A. Yes.Q. That is in the hall of the Garrick Club, is it?-A. That is in the hall, yes.Q. Downstairs? A. Downstairs.Q. After you said you would speak to him what did the Foreign Secretary say? A. He said that if I would hold it up for 24 hours there would be a better story.That is as far as I can recollect that part of the conversation.Q. Did you understand what he meant by that? A. No, I did not under-stand what he meant at all, and I did not ask him.Q. Had you any idea of the subject matter of the story about which he wasspeaking on the telephone? A. No, he did not say anything about that at all.Q. Was that the end of the conversation, or was there any more? A. No, thatwas the end of the conversation.Q. Did you come out of the box? A. Yes.Q. Did you see anybody as soon as you came out of the telephone box? A.Yes, as I came out one of the senior executives of the Daily Express, HaroldKeble, was coming down the stairs, and I asked him where he was going, and hesaid, &quot; I am going straight back to the office.&quot; I repeated this to him, I said&quot; Mr. George Brown has been on the telephone and he says we are running a&apos; D&apos; notice stoiy in Glasgow.&quot; I said to Keble, &quot; Please see what it is all aboutand let me know.&quot;
Q. Did Mr. Keble then leave the club? A. Yes.Q. Where did you go? A. I went then immediately upstairs, back to thetdinner, and walked behind the guests and stood behind Derek Marks.Q. When you left the dinner had someone been making a speech? A. when left, yes.Q. When you returned the speeches had finished, had they? A. Yes.Q. You walked behind the table to where Mr. Marks was sitting? A. Yes.Q. Did you speak to him? A. Yes, I did.Q. What did you say? A. I said that Mr. George Brown had been on the telephone to me and had told me that we were running a story in Glasgow which came under a &apos; D &apos; notice. I also said to Mr. Marks, &quot; I have told the foreign secretary that if this is the case we must take it out.&quot;Q. Did Derek Marks say anything to you? A. He said, &quot;I will find out what it is.&quot;Q. Did you see him then leave the room? A. He left the room immediately.Q. And you went where? A. I went back to my seat.Q. Did you see Mr. Marks again that evening actually see him? A. Yes,he came back in about ten minutes and said that he had been on to Glasgowand they said that they did not know what he was talking about, and he nowassumed that this was the cable vetting story which was the lead of the newspaper.Q. Had you heard the words &quot; cable vetting &quot; before then? A. No, not atall.Q. Did he say anything about the cable-vetting story and Colonel Lohan? A. What he said then was, &quot; I think the Foreign Secretary must be under amisapprehension because Colonel Lohan has cleared the story and no &apos; D &apos; noticeapplies &quot;.Q. What did you say when Mr. Marks said this to you? A. I said that inthat case we must get back to the Foreign Secretary and explain to him, as amatter of courtesy, because he had rung me, that no &apos; D &apos; notice did apply andtherefore we were going on with the story.Q. When you first heard the words &quot; running the story in Glasgow &quot; did any kind of story immediately come to your mind? A. No.Q. None at all?- A. I could not think what it was, no.Q. After the dinner did you go back to your flat? A. Yes.Q. Did you speak later to the editor? A. I spoke to the editor. He saidthat he could not get in touch with the Foreign Secretary; he had tried; andhe said that he had told Mr. Greig that Colonel Lohan had cleared the storyand he hoped I expect he thought Mr. Greig would pass the message on tothe Foreign Secretary because we could not get him on the telephone.Q. Is there any doubt in your mind, Sir Max, about your use of the word&quot; if &quot; in the phrase, &quot; If we are running a story under &apos; D&apos; notice we will take it out&quot;.  Is there any doubt in your mind? A. None at all, no.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Thank you.Chairman: Sir Max, I have one or two questions. How long would you say the telephone conversation between you and Mr. Brown lasted? A. Sir, it tookme a little time to get downstairs because I could not find the box, and I would think the conversation took two or three minutes.Q. Not more? A. No.Q. I think it is common ground between you and Mr. Brown that the subjectof the story he was speaking about was not mentioned between you? A. No, itwas not, sir.Q. You did not know, you tell us, what the story was, and he did not give it a subject or a title? A. No, sir.
Q. Then Mr. Brown&apos;s recollection was I think that he did not make reference(to the Glasgow edition. Is your mind quite clear that that was the way he spoke of it? A. Yes, sir, my mind is quite clear on that.Q. If the story was under &apos; D &apos; notice you did not know what the subject of the story was and you were not told? A. Yes.Q. Obviously misunderstandings can arise over this sort of exchange. Did youstress the &quot; if &quot;, or did you just say, &quot; If it is under &apos; D&apos; notice we will take it out&quot;? What was the emphasis given? A. It is rather hard to say that. I said, &quot; If it is under a &apos; D &apos; notice &quot;, just like that: &quot; If it is under a &apos; D&apos;notice I will take it out&quot;.Q. Now this thing about a better story which you say you understood from him: that does not agree with Mr. Brown&apos;s recollection because, as I under-stand him, he was not speaking of you if you waited for 24 hours getting abetter story to print; he was really saying or I think he rather got the impres-sion you were saying, &quot; Well, if we take it out we shall want to know all about it&quot;. Was not that the way the exchange went? A. No, Sir, not really. i could not understand what he meant. He said, &quot; You hold it up for 24 hours and there will be a better story&quot;, or &quot; There will be a story&quot;, or something like that. I could not understand him. But what I did understand perfectly well, which alerted me very seriously, was that we were running a story undera &apos; D&apos; notice, and this was what worried me.Q. But you did realise that if you did hold it up you were going to be offered some further information about it? A. That is what I rather gathered,sir, yes.Q. Did it seem to you he was saying, &quot; And that information will enable you to print a fuller account when you do &quot;? A. That is what I gathered, yes.Q. I rather get the impression you were not very clear as to what the offer was, or what the condition, or whatever it was was, was? A. No, sir, I was not.Mr. Shinwell: When the Foreign Secretary telephoned you he appeared to beemphatic that this story was associated with a &apos; D &apos; notice? A. Yes, it was avery friendly conversation, sir.Q. But you had no doubt that was in his mind, that he was quite clear thatthe &apos; D&apos; notice applied to this story? A. No doubt about it.Q. But subsequently in your talk with your editor he took the oppositeview? A. Yes, sir, he took an opposite view of the fact, that the story hadbeen cleared by Colonel Lohan, and when he told me that fact I said, &quot; then the Foreign Secretary must be under a misapprehension &quot;.Q. I presume you are aware that Colonel Lohan inJiis evidence did indicatethat he tried to convince Mr. Chapman Pincher that the &apos; D &apos; notice was relevant,but then he took another line when that failed and appealed to him on grounds of security?- A. Yes.Q. Could I ask you, as a responsible newspaper proprietor, when there is any doubt in the newspaper world among editors and those associated with theeditorial staff and so on about whether a story should be published or not, ifthere is an indication from government sources that it might impinge on our security, what would be the appropriate action? A. I think the appropriate action, sir, must be left with the editor. The editor discusses with me policy.I must trust the editor implicitly, as indeed I do.Q. But you would be speaking as a citizen, a responsible citizen, that when there are doubts perhaps the matter of security is paramount? A. Sir, all Iknew that night was that the story had been cleared by Colonel Lohan, andthe editor gave me that assurance. When the editor gives me that assurancethen I will go along with the editor.Q. I can only ask you in retrospect, would it not have been preferable therewere doubts, obviously Colonel Lohan had doubts: there was a conversation,almost a controversy, between him and Mr. Chapman Pincher in retrospectwould it not have been better not to print the story? A. No, sir, I do not
think so. I think if the editor&apos;s decision was to print and he had the assurance from Colonel Lohan then I would go along and in retrospect do exactly thesame thing.Q. That is, that the editor has the determining voice? A. On news, sir,yes.Q. When you had the conversation with your editor you were only concernedwith whether the &apos; D &apos; notice applied, in which case you would suggest to him that it ought not to be printed? A. No, the editor said to me, sir, &quot; The &apos; D&apos;notice does not apply and that has been agreed with Colonel Lohan &quot;, and thatwas sufficient for me to back the editor in his determination not his determina-tion in his judgment to print the story, and of course the story was alreadyprinting.Q. It never occurred to you at that time that even if the &apos; D &apos; notice did notapply the government had made representations through the Foreign secretary and perhaps the story should not have been printed because of that? A. No,sir.Q. You claim you are primarily concerned about protecting the publicinterest? A. You mean going back on the story?Q. Yes. A. I think the story was justified, sir.Q. You were concerned about safeguarding the public interest? A. Yes.Q. But is there not another aspect which relates to the public interest, thematter of security? A. That would have been covered by a &apos; D&apos; notice.Q. Always covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice? A. Yes, I think always covered bya &apos; D &apos; notice.Q. Can it not happen, has it never happened, that, when a &apos; D &apos; notice doesnot apply, because of representations made by government stories have not been published? A. Not to my knowledge.Chairman: Thank you, Sir Max.(The witness withdrew)Sir Peter Rawlinson: I have one short witness, Mr. Munday who is in chargeof the editorial messenger boys; he is going to produce a document and will bevery short indeed.Mr. S. G. Munday called examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. You are Stanley George Munday and you are in charge of the editorialmessenger boys in the Daily Express office? A. Yes.Q. Do you remember having a telephone conversation with Colonel Lohan? A. Yes sir.Q. When, about, was that? A. About two or three days after the Wednesday.Q. Wednesday the 22nd?-A. Yes.Q. Just very shortly tell the committee what was said, will you? -A. Mainlyhe said that he wanted the full names. He said, &quot;Have you sent two boys tome? &quot; I said yes. He said, &quot; Was there one like Floyd? &quot; and I said &quot; Yes,just a moment, I will check my list.&quot; I checked my list which I had in front of me, and I said, &quot; Yes, I sent the boy Smallman on Tuesday and the boyFloyd on Wednesday.&quot;Q. Did it show from your list that it was on Tuesday the 21st that the firstboy had gone?-A. Yes sir, and Wednesday.Q. What happend then? A. He said, &quot; Could I have the full names then? &quot;I told him David Smallman and Peter Floyd.Q. Did you know anything about Colonel Lohan enquiring about receipts? A. I heard later on in the office that he was after some receipts, or something like that. He was after a receipt and he wanted the boys&apos; names for that I suppose.
Q. And you produce it is before the committee the original of the messengerist? A. Yes.Chairman: To be frank, the conversations between Mr. Munday and colonel lohan were not I think put to Colonel Lohan, were they?Sir Peter Rawlinson: No, they were not, but we did not of course know at thattime.Chairman: Colonel Lohan shall be shown the shorthand note of what Mr.Munday says, and if there is anything in dispute or anything turns on it he can have a chance of coming back.(The witness withdrew)Mr. M. Green called examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. You are Mr. Maurice Green?-A. Yes.Q. And are you the editor of the Daily Telegraph? A. Yes.Q. How long have you been editor, Mr. Green? A. For just over three years.Q. I do not want to exaggerate, but have you had a lifetime&apos;s experience injournalism? A. Yes, I have been in journalism all my life except for the war years.Q. Does that mean you have also been with other newspaper groups apartfrom the Telegraph group?-A. I was on The Times for a long time, as deputyeditor of The Times for some years.Q. Have you read the cable vetting story which was written by Mr. chapman pincher and published in the Express which came out on the 21st? A. Yes.Chairman: Take this rather slowly if you do not mind because I want tofollow what Mr. Green&apos;s point of view is.Sir Peter Rawlinson: You read the cable vetting story? A. Yes.Q. I will put it before you. Just looking at that story, on the face of it doesit appear to you to be in breach of any &apos; D &apos; notice with which you are acquainted?-A. No.Q. In other words, just reading that story, did it strike you as being in breach of a &apos; D &apos; notice? A. When I read the story, no, it did not occur to me it couldbe in breach of a &apos; D&apos; notice at all.Q. You have before you I think the &apos; D&apos; notices of April 1956, October 1957and October 1961. Over the page of the April 1956 &apos;D&apos; notice you will seean appendix attached to it A. Yes.Q. What do you say with regard to that? You will see there that some intel-Intelligence or counter-intelligence methods and activities in&apos;&apos; or outside the UnitedKingdom you are asked to make no reference to, and if you look at the appendixit says:  &quot; Note to (i). Certain methods employed in Intelligence work are tosome extent a matter of common knowledge and it is thus understandablethat editors would not normally regard them as secret methods.&quot;Again, bearing in mind the story by Mr. Chapman Pincher and that &apos; D &apos; notice and its appendix, do you regard that story as in breach of that part of that&apos; D&apos; notice? A. No, I reread this &apos; D &apos; notice of 1956 after the question of the daily Express story being in breach of &apos; D &apos; notices had been raised in Parliament.It was some time since I had read it, but I did recall the impression which this made on me when I had originally read it. I had always assumed of course all my life the fact that there was occasional reading of cablegrams and so on for security purposes was common knowledge and that reference to it was OK. Ican remember reading this and being surprised by clause (i) of the main notice.I read that before I realised there was an appendix, and then of course I turned to the appendix, the note to (i) &quot; Certain methods employed in Intelligence work are to some extent a matter of common knowledge &quot;, and so on, and I thought
that this after all confirmed my view. If any method employed in intelligencework is a matter of common knowledge it was presumably the interception ofcables, seeing this was the one thing I think, as far as I can remember, specificallycovered in the Official Secrets Act and was therefore public knowledge anyway.Q. That phrase &quot; common knowledge &quot; ; common knowledge to whom did you think it meant? A. I should have thought common knowledge to everybody.I would have been surprised at any time if one had mentioned it in a company of people that it would not be treated as something which they all knew orbelieved to be true and recognised.Q. Is there any restriction on the use of commercial codes and so on which persons can employ when sending cables? A. I had always assumed, rightlyor wrongly, that the reason for the restriction of business houses and so onthrough the regular commercial codes in the code books was so that people shouldnot be allowed to use codes which were proof against decyphering, or which made decyphering more difficult.Chairman: Mr. Green, if you do not use the common accepted codes you may invent a code of your own, using plain language, surely? A. I am notexpert in this, sir.Q. The purpose of protection is to see whether plain language cables are not themselves a code of their own. A. I had never regarded for example the ordinarystandard abbreviations which we use we use strange words in press cables as being codes.   I dare say they are in some sense.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I was on the point of the cables being seen by anybodyother than the clerk taking the cable or the person receiving it. The fact thatthere is a restriction upon codes, does that in any way in your view indicatethat other people do read cables? A. I had always supposed so.Q. Were you aware of the report of the committee of Privy Councillors in 1957 were you on The Times at that time? A. Yes.Q. That dealt with interception and actually gives the number of cables whichare intercepted and actually gives the number of letters intercepted, does it not? A. Yes, I seem to remember it.Chairman: It is in the appendix, is it not?Sir Peter Rawlinson: It is in the appendix; paragraph 120 in fact deals withletters and telegrams. Anyhow, when it was common knowledge obviouslyperhaps a man in Ilfracombe or wherever it may be may not know cables werebeing vetted but what is the purpose of the &apos; D &apos; notice? Is the purpose of the&apos; D&apos; notice to prevent people knowing what is happening, or is it to assist theSecurity Services? A. I have always regarded it as a matter of helping the newspapers by means of guidelines which are issued by the &apos;D&apos; Notice Com-mittee, where matters are discussed between press and broadcasting people and defence people on the other side to help us with guidelines, to help us to seewhere we can draw a balance between the public interest generally and theparticular public State interest in keeping certain things dark.Q. Are these to be interpreted as it were like a lawyer interpreting a deed or a statutory provision, or is it for the journalist to look at them and make his judgment? A. I have regarded them as things put out to help us and to enable us to make a good judgment. I do not regard them as regulations. If I regardedthem as regulations I think I should complain about most of them on the grounds of their being ambiguous and obscure, and so on. It is the nature of thingsput out for general guidance to be sometimes a bit ambiguous and obscure.Q. Do you think, just on that, that cable vetting was a secret intelligencemethod which was secret to spies or agents or other Security Services do you think that is so? A. I think I originally read this clause (i) &quot; secret intelligenceor counter intelligence methods &quot; as being rather ambiguous. I think at first sight it seemed to me to rule out almost anything, and therefore it was not until I turned to the appendix to see whether there was some explanation of thisrather broad and perhaps not very meaningful statement that I seemed to see what I thought it meant.
After the 1957 committee of Privy Councillors had reported on the inter-ception of communications, which included telegrams and mail, the letter of,31st October, 1957 was written. It refers there to the Privy Councils reporton telephone tapping, and it says in view of that report you are no longerbeing asked to maintain secrecy on the use of telephone tapping as one of themethods employed by the security services. It has been suggested that if telephone tapping has been taken off the secret list this did not take off cable vetting andI suppose letter opening. Do you agree with that, that letter opening, thefact that letters are opened and cables are vetted, is a matter which you are recommended not to write about under &apos; D &apos; notice? A. No. I must admit that before the notice on telephone tapping I think I would probably have regardedtelephone tapping as a thing which one probably was at liberty to mention theexistence of anyway, but I would not have regarded this letter on telephone tapping as having anything to do with cables. I had the idea myself thatcables were the one thing which were specifically covered in the Official secrets act and therefore could be regarded as by far the commonest and best knownform of interception.Q. If a story were brought to you this afternoon that all mail letters werebeing intercepted, opened and read by government officials just suppose that asa hypothetical question do you think you would be forbidden under that &apos; D&apos;notice to report this?-A. No.Q. Just look now at the October, 1961 &apos; D &apos; notice, clause (2):  &quot; The various methods used in the interception of foreign communicationsfor secret intelligence purposes. In this connection the Committee request that you will not refer to the fact that on occasions it is necessary in theinterest of defence for the Services to intercept such communications.&quot;Do you think that has any application to the cable vetting story, in your judgmentas an experienced journalist? A. I must say I was surprised when I came to look at this carefully, after the incident of the Express story and its discussion inParliament, how ambiguous and obscure it appeared to be. It was not a thingwhich I had noticed very much at the time because what I thought was the &apos; D &apos;notice committee&apos;s attitude to the general question of cable examination andinterception was already clear. I would always suppose, in the way these &apos; D&apos;notices work or are intended to work, that if it had been intended to put a newrestriction on the general practice of the Security Services occasionally interceptingand looking at cables, I would have expected the &apos; D&apos; notice to make thingsabsolutely clear. Normally if a new restriction is put on it is made absolutelyclear you are being asked to repress something or not to talk about something which you were talking about before. But this was not so in this case. looking at the wording, I must admit it looks highly ambiguous and very difficult tounderstand.Q. Do you think generally then that that cable vetting story is a clear breach of either or both or of any of those &apos;D&apos; notices? A.T do not think it is a breach of any of these &apos; D&apos; notices, certainly not a clear one.Q. You can perhaps help us on this, Mr. Green, from your experience again.If a &apos; D&apos; notice does not apply or is laid aside but you do receive a personalrequest from Colonel Lohan not to publish a particular story, is there in yourview any discretion left to you? Do you have to comply with that request,or can you make up your own mind whether to intercept it or not? A. most certainly one has every discretion. It is a request which one would regardcarefully, much in the same way as one would regard a request from some highofficial of the Ministry of Defence, but one certainly is absolutely entitled touse one&apos;s discretion about how far one meets a request, and that is to say notonly in theory but in practice. We have had these requests from time to time;sometimes we have complied with them completely, sometimes partially, sometimesnot at all. They are a matter of discussion in the office.Q. You say you have had these requests. In what form have they reachedyou through the Colonel, through a separate approach from the Ministry, or what? A. I am thinking entirely of requests from the &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee,from Colonel Lohan or his predecessor.
Q. A personal approach, or a circular on the paper of the committee? A. Ido not think we would regard it as anything other than personal, individual, ifit was simply on the paper of the committee. If it said, &quot; I am asked by thecommittee &quot;, I think one would treat it slightly differently then.Chairman: I do not know which you are saying. Not something on theauthority of the committee? A. I am thinking of the answer to the question.I was asked about personal requests not specifically in writing on the authorityof the committee.Q. And in regard to them, whether from Admiral Thomson or from colonel lohan, you have regarded the matter as being one for your editorial discretion,is that right? A. Yes.Q. Listening to the arguments which he advances, and weighing them against any other arguments you think ought to be applied? A. Yes indeed, sir.Sir Peter Rawlinson: If the personal request was made on the grounds that publication of this story would jeopardise specific security operations whichwere then in train, what do you say would be the position then? A. Of course in this case one would ask a certain number of questions on one&apos;s own account.Q. If you were satisfied he was saying definitely there was some specificoperation going on? A. This of course would weigh with one tremendously. i cannot think of a practical case, I am afraid.Q. It would weigh with you tremendously, the fact that it was a specificoperation? A. Yes.Q. Would that be in the nature of some evidence that there really was a very important security element in this particular story? A. Yes. Could I give oneillustration of that? This was a case which stood a long time in my mind,where we did both consult Colonel Lohan and also accede to his request incertain particulars; I think probably it is a good example. This was a case where we did get a report, a reliable one, about a high level Russian defector,Dolnytsin was his name and we did refer this for advice to Colonel Lohan incase there should be some particular angles in it. His request was that we shouldnot publish the story at all, but we were not willing to accede to that. In thelight of the fact that they thought the Russians did not know where this chapwas and we did, we did publish the story but without his name and without his present whereabouts. We did publish his name subsequently, but that was because it was put out by the &apos; D&apos; Notice Committee itself on the tape; thiswas another thing. This is the kind of relationship one would have.Q. Just one question on a general matter. Is it strange at all in the newspaperworld that the proprietor does not know what is going to be in the paper on aparticular evening, in your experience, you have worked in different newspapers? A. Most proprietors would hardly ever know.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Thank you, Mr. Green.Chairman: We are grateful to you for coming here and helping us with your views but I just want to see how long your experience of the &apos; D &apos; notice world is.Did you work at The Times, from where you came to the Telegraph, involveyou with troubling yourself with &apos; D &apos; notices? A. It did for ten years or so.Q. These particular ones, April, 1956 and October, 1961, have you in yourworking experience either at The Times or the Telegraph had to puzzle out theiractual application in a particular case or cases? A. I cannot recall any instance,no sir.Q. So your views on what they extend to and what they mean really arise as an experienced newspaperman from looking at them with careful scrutinywhen this particular question of the Daily Express&quot;s article arose, is that right? A. Very nearly, sir, but not quite. I had certainly very firmly in my mind the idea that certain general practices which are common enough to allintelligence services all over the world could be freely mentioned, but withoutany reference to particular systems or techniques. That is what stood in my mind.
Q. Yes, I understand that, but had you actually faced the question, if thatis all right how does it tie in with these particular &apos; D&apos; notices? A. I cannotrecall anything, sir.   I do not think I would have had to really.Q. That is what I wanted to know. Then we look at the April 1956 noticeas we have been doing and try to see what we can make of it. I am notabsolutely clear how far you go. Sub-paragraph (i) refers both to methods and activities, does it not? A. Yes sir.Q. And therefore we have not only got to think of methods ; we have got tothink of activities or operations.   Would that be right? A. Yes sir.Q. And you say it is very difficult to know what it covered by some intelligenceor counter intelligence methods and activities, but as regards methods there is some help given by the note over the page which refers to common knowledge.In your view of it what is a secret method nowadays? You say people can see that there can be cable vetting from looking at the Official Secrets Act ifthey have it. You can say that the report of the Privy Councillors in 1957makes it plain that governments will exercise both vetting of mail and vettingof what they call telegrams under the restrictions which they recommend there.Then no doubt there are certain ways of conducting intelligence by visualaids, photographing documents from a great distance when people do not expectit, listening devices like bugging, breaking down radio transmissions and allthat; all of those are known about as weapons of government, are they not? A. Yes sir.Q. Is it all right &quot;to say that any particular one of these is being operated by your own government? A. I would have thought any one of those, in the sense of a generalised method, and the reason I define the use and interception of cables is that I would always have said the general use of telephone tapping.I would look much more carefully if a thing were referred to me if there wasanything which indicated a particular type of people who were using it, or particular areas where it had been used, or anything like that.Q. So there really are no secret methods, because all of them virtually are known about in a general sense; is that right? A. These obvious methods Iwould say so.Q. Yes, I think they are all obvious. Then what about the activity? I wouldnot have thought that cable vetting, with respect to you, as we learn about it,was conducted publicly. A. It is not conducted publicly certainly not.Q. Well then, is it not a secret activity? I am putting it to you perhaps in a legal way, but after all some legal consideration has got to be given tothese documents. A. I do not see quite how there can be a method employedunless there is some activity in employing the method; it seems to me rathertwo sides of the same thing. When &apos; D &apos; notices talk,^ about activities I shouldhave thought what would spring to my mind would be actual things being doneby particular people or particular groups or types of people whereby they mightbe identified in some way.Q. I see. &quot; Agents working for Government security services are at presentmaking a very wide use of special listening devices &quot; do you think that wouldbe all right as a piece of newspaper information under these &apos; D &apos; notices? A.Yes I might have a reservation about the words &quot; very wide &quot;.Q. I thought you had in mind that if you said a particular street down inRotherhithe was being fitted up by security agents with listening devices thatwould be objectionable because it would be a tip off?-A. I certainly wouldnot say it was being done in the London area or the Midland area ; I would regard that as not right.Q. You say about the 1957 one about telephone tapping that you do not thinkthat telephone tapping in general was ever covered by &apos; D &apos; notice. But thatis not consistent with what the Press and Broadcasting Committee are sayingthere, is it? I think if you read it through it is plain that because the PrivyCouncifs report has made the practice, subject to conditions, common knowledge,in view of that you can no longer be asked to maintain use of secrecy in
telephone tapping as one of the methods used by the security services.   I should^khave thought that was saying &quot; We think the 1961 one covered telephone tapping^?but it has now become common knowledge &quot;.  Would that not be the interpreta-tion you would give to it? A. Yes, that is so.  One does not of course under normal circumstances take very careful note of a &apos;D&apos; notice which tells youyou can do something.Q. That means, you say, telephone tapping is open and you go ahead A.Yes.Q. I would have thought if you did read it and say &quot;What on earth do theymean by the 1956 one?&quot; it is fairly plain it covered telephone tapping as a method.-A. I seem to remember it being discussed in the office from the pointof view that one supposed the general existence of telephone tapping could bereferred to, that this was in a sense confirmation of one&apos;s view. But I agreeit appears to suggest that the &apos; D&apos; Notice Committee themselves have taken adifferent view.Q. Then you say the more you look at the October, 1961 one, the moredifficult it is to be sure what it is referring to. And you say generally that you think the &apos; D&apos; notices that we have are ambiguous in their phrasing. I justwant to get your attitude towards them to be taken as guidelines rather than asstatutory regulations, assuming a statutory regulation is not ambiguous? A.Yes.Q. But it cannot be quite that, can it, because after all the whole importanceof the wording is that it has been worked out between those representing Govern-ment security I use the general phrase and press people who are accustomed to press life and its needs and conceptions, and a particular form of wordinghas been hammered out by compromise. But if they are to succeed, then everyonereceiving them must more or less give them the same interpretation ; otherwisethey would be no help, would they? A. Well, I should think they still wouldbe a great help even if it were not possible to make them so clear that everynewspaper interpreted them in precisely the same way.Q. But if you in the Telegraph were reading a notice which had come fromthe committee in one way and another paper was reading it in another way,and one went ahead and thought he could publish and the other one did not, thatwould be a matter of complaint at once, would it not?-A. I do not think wewould be inclined to complain if another newspaper took a different view of themeaning of a &apos; D&apos; notice than we did. I think we are prepared to accept that price for a system we value. I do not see how it would be possible to get a notice which every newspaper would interpret in precisely the same way in each individual case.Q. No, not precisely. That is no doubt why references do come in to thesecretary, who is regarded within limits as an interpretihg agent, and he doestry to harmonise where there is any ambiguity. But if you had a story which you thought was subject to &apos; D &apos; notice and another newspaper had the storyand they thought it was not subject to &apos; D &apos; notice, would you not think therewas something wrong with the system if you threw your story away and theother newspaper published it? A. I might think think there was somethingwrong with my own judgment. I would not object to that happening occasionally,no sir.Q. I had a long experience in the past of this kind of situation and I neverknew a newspaper who were agreed that if they read a &apos; D&apos; notice one way andanother newspaper read it another way and they came out with the story theywould say the other one was wrong, what are you going to do with it. But in peacetime you do not think it is an contentious as that? A. I should have thought it was impossible to frame these &apos; D&apos; notices on such general topicswithout there being a possibility of some difference of interpretation.Q. But would you think it was an improvement to the system where if therewere ambiguity a newspaper was regularly asked to refer to the secretary for aninterpretation I do not mean a ruling, but an interpretation? A. No, I wouldnot like that.
Q. You would not think that was acceptable to the press? A. I do not thinkt would really be necessary or convenient.Q. You cannot think of any improvement of the system under which therewould be an effort made to get greater harmony in interpreting what the &apos; D &apos;notices mean, apart from re-drafting them better? A. No sir, I would not reallylike an attempt made to clarify these &apos; D &apos; notices to give them the sort of standing of absolutely clear regulations of which there could be only one pos-sible interpretation in any individual case. I would think that would soonbecome a tight censorship system. I do not think the &apos; D &apos; Notice committee could work that way.Chairman: Well, thank you for your view.Mr. Shinwell: About your references to the &apos; D&apos; notices being merely a guide line, you do not regard &apos; D &apos; notices as binding? A. I do not regard it asa binding regulation, because I do not feel they are put in that form. So manythings are covered that there cannot be an absolutely strict regulation. Theycannot be drawn up in relation to individual cases, the individual story, withwhich one actually has to deal in practice. I think one would certainly regard as binding a &apos; D &apos; notice which says perfectly clearly, as so many of them have, as with regard to some piece of equipment, &quot; You can mention the speedbut not the horse power, but the cost is all right&quot; or whatever it may be. Theseare perfectly clear details which have been sorted out, and I should have thoughtthese were morally binding on a newspaper-clear details of a piece of equip-ment. In all others there must be an element of interpretation, as I see it.Q. But when you say that a personal request has not the force of a &apos; D&apos;notice, what do you mean? A. A &apos; D &apos; notice certainly has much greaterauthority. This is something which has been discussed in common viewpointarrived at between people who are in some sense representatives of the press and of the broadcasting organisation together with the Defence people on thecommittee.Q. Are you not really saying that if you do not think a &apos; D&apos; notice possesesforce that it is very much in the nature of compromise and you can use your own discretion? A. There are obviously limits to which one is morally entitledto use one&apos;s discretion on a subject covered by &apos; D &apos; notice.Q. Have you ever disregarded a &apos; D &apos; notice? A. There have not been any&apos; D &apos; notices for some time as far as I remember, but the only one I can rememberwhere we did disregard it, and for perfectly good reasons, was not an actual&apos; D &apos; notice but a notice put out by the secretary on the authority of the &apos; D &apos;notice committee, and that was in this incident to which I referred earlier of theRussian intelligence man who defected, Mr. Dolnytsin, where the message came out not to use his name, but as his name had already appeared on the tape fromthe &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee there was no point in not -mentioning his name.Q. But a personal request had been made to you? A. Yes.Q. It had not the force of a D notice. A. That was the request not to publishit at all.Q. And you published it in a vague form, not giving details of personalitiesinvolved. You responded to a personal request there? A. In part.Q. So that it is possible, if there is no validity in the &apos; D&apos; notice, at the dis-cretion of an editor not to print if there is a submission made by a Governmentdepartment?-A. It is certainly within the editor&apos;s discretion.Q. May I turn your attention to what you said about cable vetting being amatter of common knowledge? That is what you said, is it not?-A. Yes.Q. You said everybody more or less is aware of it. In the Daily Telegraph,which I read every morning, do you see published on the front page sensationalheadlines, banner headlines, for stories about which there is common know-ledge? A. Not in preference.   Maybe we sometimes do, but not deliberately.Q. Can I direct your attention to the Daily Express-&apos; Sensation&apos; (copy shown to witness).   Would you say that that was a matter of common knowledge?225
I do not want you to incriminate yourself, Mr. Green.-A. The allegation that asystem which was common knowledge had been vastly extended was not itselfcommon knowledge.Q. Would you say that indicated something about which everybody was fully aware? A. No.Q. No. You would not publish that with sensational banner headlines, wouldyou? Perhaps I ought not to ask you.-A. We might have published the storyif we had ourselves grounds for supposing that it was so.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Mr. Green, with regard to the system, I gather you sayyou do not think the &apos; D &apos; notice should be made more specific? A. I shouldbe rather afraid of a system which tried to go too far in that way.Q. Because looking at the notice of April, 1956, (ii) (iii) (iv) and (v) are fairlyspecific, are they not: identities of persons engaged? A. Yes.Q. Information from which the number, duties or type of staff could be ascer-tained, and information from which could be deduced the addresses, and specialmethods of training. The one which bothers me is (i), which is so very vague secret intelligence or counter intelligence methods and activities in or outside theUnited Kingdom. And then the conclusion, which says &quot;... earnestly requestyou, when in doubt, to act on the principle that as little publicity as possible should be given to their activities &quot;. That is at the bottom of the page, justabove the Admiral&apos;s signature. So that does seem to envisage that some pub-publicity is going to be given. Construing (i) strictly one would not have thought there would be any references to anything. A. There is one of the contradictionswhich I myself find in this particular notice.Q. And you say it ought to be left as vague as that, with the editor of the newspaper having discretion as to whether to obey the &apos; D &apos; notice or not? A. Ithink I do. I do not find this notice, despite its technical obscurities and ambitious-guities and internal contradictions I do not find it by any means a uselessnotice. Clause (i) in the main notice and the final paragraph, which you quoted,and the first note in the appendix are all dealing, which the other parts ofthat notice are not, with very delicate ground, on which a matter of seriousmoral public interest may be involved. That I think is the point at which thejournalists and broadcasting people and Defence people on the committee donot talk precisely the same language, and this is the sort of result that comesabout.Q. But you feel that if ever it was represented to any paper that particularactivity was directed at certain people, in that case the paper would not pub-lish? A. I think so, yes. I would regard it, for example, as a matter ofcommon knowledge that the head of the secret service is not named and appears in works of reference under some rather different description. It may be that heretires. I do not think probably a reference to the fact that he had retired wouldbe against any &apos; D &apos; notice or Official Secrets Act or anything else. But one prob-ably would not mention it all the same. It is a particular form of something which is generally known.Q. Supposing you had got this story of cables being vetted and somebodysaid &quot; Look here, we are just at the point of getting a very valuable piece ofinformation out of some foreign delegation. Don&apos;t publish the story until thatoperation is over&quot;, would you have accepted that? A. I should be so sur-prised if I got such a request I hardly know what I would do. It seems to beso inconceivable that anybody should think these trading delegations, or whateverthey are, who are of any political consequence do not know. I do not believe it would be relevant.Q. I see. So far as the notices are concerned, do you think there is scope for any kind of appeal body or further body to whom a dispute could bereferred I am talking about a voluntary basis, of course. You have the Com-mittee which authorises the &apos; D&apos; notice, the secretary acts as interpreter or per-suader. Supposing you still get the difference of opinion between Colonel Lohan,in this case, and the editor of the newspaper? Do you think it is conceivableto create another type of voluntary committee, or should it go back to the
^original committee or not? A. Off the cuff I should have thought there wouldmot be scope for such a body. It might make the organisation too slow-moving,too top-heavy. Also I am not clear what kind of body it would be. But I wouldnot dismiss the idea; this is just an off-the-cuff reaction.Q. Do you think the newspapers would accept an agreed period of delay, saytwenty-four hours, or would they be so frightened of competitors getting holdof the story? A. I think they would find it very difficult to accept it willingly.(The witness withdrew)Mr. L. A. Lee Howard called examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. You are Mr. Lee Howard? A. Yes.Q. And you are the editor of the Daily Mirror? A. Yes.Q. How long have you been the editor of the Daily Mirror? A. Just over six years.Q. Have you spent all your life as a journalist? A. Yes.Q. And I think you were until your resignation on the 25th or 26th Februarya member of the Services, Press and Broadcasting Committee, and had been for two or three years? A. Yes.Q. Did you write the letter which is published in the Daily Mirror of 25thFebruary, which was your letter of resignation? A. Yes.Q. Did that express accurately your opinion with regard to this cable vettingmatter and &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Yes, it did.Q. You say in that letter:&quot; It is with regret that I have to tender my resignation from the Services,Press and Broadcasting Committee.I must ask you to consider me to have resigned from today&apos;s date, since i do not feel able to attend any meeting that may be called in the immediatefuture to discuss the dispute between the Government and the Daily Express.Any such meeting would be a gross abuse of the functions of the &apos; D&apos;Notice Committee, which in my view exists solely to provide a link betweenthe Government, on one hand, and the voluntary acceptance by thePress, on the other, of the need to restrain publication of certain information in the national interest.I know of no &apos; D &apos; notice which would have any direct bearing on the story published by Mr. Chapman Pincher in the Daily Express. If no such notice exists, as I believe, I cannot see what possible function the Committeecan fulfil in considering this dispute between a most reputable journalist anda disapproving Government.The &apos; D&apos; Notice Committee is not an instrument of censorship but a voluntary body. It has been a privilege to have represented the national press on it; but I cannot participate in any attempt to use the Committeein a way which was never intended and particularly to rule upon the conductof a journalist of high integrity and his newspaper.I would add only that my resignation in no way reflects upon the way inwhich you . . .&quot;-That is Colonel Lohan?-A. Yes.&quot;... have conducted the affairs of the Committee, which has earned theadmiration and confidence of myself and my newspaper colleagues &quot;.Q. Before you wrote that you had read Mr. Chapman Pincher&apos;s story, whichis now before you, on cable vetting, of 21st February? A. Yes, I had.Q. And you are on the committee.   And are you familiar with the relevantD &apos; notices? A. Yes, I am.Q. I think you have before you now the &apos; D&apos; notice of April, 1956, the letterof October, 1957, and the &apos; D &apos; notice of October, 1961?-A. Yes.
Q. What do you think about checking cables? Is that in your view a secretintelligence method? A. I think that it could be a secret intelligence method ;I do not think it is one in the normal sense, and not in the sense that was usedhere.Q. When you say not in the sense that it was used here, what do you meanby that? A. I mean this is a story about a practice which has been going on for many years and is a general story, the general looking at cables and telegrams,and is not about anything specifically secret as is expressed in &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. But would the checking of cables be in your view common knowledge? A. Yes, it would be common knowledge to anyone in the intelligence services of,I should have thought, any country.Q. And the object, as I understand it correct me if I am wrong is that a&apos; D&apos; notice is a letter of advice and request not to publish in the national interest? A. Yes, that is so.Q. It is not directed, is it, just to keep quiet from the general public what goes on, but it is to help in preventing foreign intelligence from finding things out? -A. Yes, that is quite right.Q. Therefore in that context would cable vetting be a secret intelligencemethod? A. I do not quite understand &quot; in that context&quot;.Q. Well, in the context of what I think you have indicated before, that thewhole idea of &apos; D &apos; notices is to try and prevent publishing intelligence methods and is directed against foreign intelligence finding things out. In that contextis cable vetting, do you think, a secret intelligence matter? A. No, not in thatcontext.Q. You see, the headline of that, it is a very fat, big headline. Why wouldthat be printed if cable vetting is common knowledge? A. Because this is a paper published for the general public, and it does not automatically followbecause a thing is common knowledge in intelligence circles that ordinary membersof the public would know about it. It is sensational enough to be the lead forthe Daily Express on the basis that many members of the general public mightwant to know that this practice was going on ; but it would not tell any foreignintelligence agent anything, I should have thought.Q. But as an experienced member of this &apos; D&apos; Notice Committee or you were do you think (i) of the 1956 &apos; D &apos; notice would deter you, if you got thatstory, from publishing? A. No, not at all. The note (i) to that in particularI think would free one.Q. And there followed a letter, dated October, 1957, which followed the BirkettPrivy CounciFs report. If it is said that that releases from the secret list, asit were, telephone tapping because of that report, does that necessarily mean thatit leaves under the secret heading letter opening and cable vetting? A. I shouldnot have thought so. I think this point is covered again by this first note to the&apos; D &apos; notice of April, 1956 &quot; Certain methods employed in Intelligence work areto some extent a matter of common knowledge &quot;.Q. Of course, any security-minded person or foreign agent having presented to them the Privy CounciFs report of 1957 must certainly have known cables and letters are intercepted. They are even given the details of the figures, are theynot? A. Yes, one would have thought so.Q. So there would be no disguising from them after that that cables and letters are opened? A. I certainly would not have thought so, no.Q. Just look at the &apos; D&apos; notice of 1961, (2) -the various methods used in the interception of foreign communications for secret intelligence purposes. Do you think that would have been a bar, in your view, if you had had that story, to your publishing it? A. No, I do not. I do not think this &apos; D&apos; notice was intended to relate to this story or matters of that sort at all. In my opinion itrefers to methods used by M.I.5 or M.I.6 which it is not desirable should be generally known. You will note it says &quot;... you will not refer to the factthat on occasions it is necessary&quot;. This &apos; D &apos; notice refers to a specific act inmy opinion by intelligence services and not to a general act.
OQ. Mr. Chapman Pincher has said that &apos; D&apos; notices were laid aside ; it hasbeen said, and not challenged, that &apos; D &apos; notices were laid aside when colonel lohan spoke to the Mail. Laying aside therefore those &apos; D &apos; notices, if you asan editor received a personal request from Colonel Lohan not to publish, haveyou any discretion in your view under the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure or convention? A. Complete discretion, I should have thought. Colonel Lohan is a member ofthe committee, the secretary. I could ask him for advice. But if it is only advice that is given without reference to &apos; D&apos; notices, then clearly I would have thoughtany editor could comply with that request or not.Q. And if the editor publishes in spite of the request would you say that wasa breach of the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure or convention, or the spirit of the &apos; D&apos;notice?-A. No, I would not. If an item is not covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice I donot see how you can break the &apos; D &apos; notice in this, or break the spirit of the &apos; D &apos;notice.Q. Suppose something came up which was not covered specifically or directly by &apos; D &apos; notice and Colonel Lohan came to you and said &quot; Look, please do not publish this, we are engaged in a specific operation &quot;, what effect could you saythat hypothetical situation would have on you? A. I think that would have aconsiderable effect, if it were a specific operation and he had a good reason forasking.Q. Turning back to this story of cable vetting, quite apart from the securityelement are there in your view other elements of public interest? A. Oh certainlyyes ; I think it is a story of great public interest,Q. Do you agree with the Privy Council in 1957 who in general terms saidthat interception of communications, letters, telegrams, telephone tapping, isgenerally regarded with disfavour? Would you agree with that view? A. Yes,I would.Q. And they said that disfavour was allayed to some extent because it wasonly exercised very selectively. Do you think an editor faced with this positionof this general public interest, and also a security element, should seriously take into account the moral public interest or the invasion of privacy or liberty? A. Yes, I do ; I think that is the whole point of the story.Q. The last hypothetical question. If you had been in Mr. Mark&apos;s shoes andhad had that story, as an editor, Mr. Lee Howard, what would you have done? A. It is slightly difficulty to answer that question, because I do not know what Colonel Lohan may have said to Mr. Marks in arguing he should not printit. But seeing the story in the paper as it is I am inclined to think I wouldhave printed it.Q. And if Colonel Lohan had never spoken to the editor but only to yourdefence correspondent and passed a message through him, would that have had any effect on you? A. Well, the defence correspondent would be in duty boundto tell me.Q. And you would be in duty bound to take account of that request? A.Yes, and, I would most probably have talked to Colonel Lohan myself in those circumstances and found out what he had said.Q. Once the story was out in the Glasgow edition at a few minutes past ten inthe Scottish Daily Express was there any point in killing thereafter, would you have thought?--A. I would not have thought so, no.  It is a widely circulatedneswpaper.Q. Finally one general question. What is your experience with proprietors do they always know what story is going into the paper?- A. Very rarely, Ishould think; it is not really their function.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Thank you very much.Chairman: Mr. Lee Howard, I put a number of questions I am not sure whether you were in the room at the time to Mr. Green about his reading ofthe Defence Notices ; did you hear them? A. No sir, I did not.Q. I rather got the impression that your answers about the way you interpretedthem would be on the same lines as his.   One or two general questions.   I229
would have thought I do not know if you would agree with me- an editor&apos;s,problem in publishing anything which seems to touch on security or intelligence^activities is that he is not in a position to know what the other side that is,the imagined hostile forces-does or does not know. A. Yes, that might be so.Q. I think you have made one or two assumptions in your evidence that Iwould not have thought were necessarily very sound. If something comes outin one or two of the editions of the Daily Express in Scotland and then dis-appears and is not picked up in London, it does not by any means follow that that attracts the attention of whatever enemy intelligence service you mayimagine. Would you agree? A. With respect, sir, I do not think I would. Ithink that it would attract the attention of any intelligent intelligence service.Q. I thought the answer would be &quot; You don&apos;t know and I don&apos;t know &quot;. A.Well, it probably would be wisest. But I should have thought the Scottish daily express is so important a newspaper, that automatically any intelligence service would look at it.Q. On the other hand, if you take it out and its disappearance attracts atten-tion, importance is given to the incident which may not necessarily have beengiven to it otherwise? A. Yes.Q. So there are the two things. Now, with regard to cable vetting I amcalling it vetting, not censorship there is a difference between an imaginedhostile service knowing that cable vetting can be resorted to under the official secrets Act and knowing that it is habitually and regularly applied; wouldyou not agree? A. There is a difference, certainly.Q. A difference in value to them, though?-A. I do not know that. I shouldhave thought if they knew it could happen that knowledge was the knowledge thatthey would need. And as to the regularity of it I would not have thought thatwould make a great deal of difference, unless a story of this sort took theform of saying &quot; Last week ...&quot;Q. Yes, I quite follow that; that would be what may be called an even moresensitive thing. A. Yes.Q. But can you not imagine this, that people who thought that they couldrisk some form of communication through the cable service if they were adroitin their manipulation of the form of their message might risk it if they thoughtthat only occasional resort was made to cable vetting, but might not risk it if they thought that all cables were regularly inspected? Do you not see that?-A. I see it. It is rather difficult to answer. I do not imagine if Lwere engagedin espionage that I would risk sending a cable at any time.Q. I am only putting these as examples because they are involved in theevidence you have given of the kind of thing one really is ignorant about andis taking possibly some risk in publishing.  Do you see force in that?-A. Well,I am afraid I do not, sir, no. I think that anybody would,know this.Q. It is only relevant really because there may be an argument where youare dealing with any activities of this kind for a more blanket approach of goingabout it than there are in other cases because of knowing the significance of whatyour publication is. Do you criticise this letter, as Mr. Green did, that it reallywas very general and you could not work it in a general sense like (ii) seemedto suggest? A. I do think it is an extremely loosely worded letter.Q. What is your general view about the wording of &apos;D&apos; notices? Could theyhave been more precisely and happily phrased? A. Some of them could, par-ticularly some of the earlier ones, but usually speaking they are worked out asa result of very careful deliberation between members of the committee.Q. That is what I thought. A. Yes, they are.Q. In a sense the committee, to which you have belonged, is responsible forthe working of them? A. Absolutely, sir, yes, completely.Q. On a subject of this kind which is itself very sensitive that is, intelligence,counter intelligence, security do you think it would be possible to get a more precise and more closely expressed form of warning to the Press? Somewarning must be given, must it not?-A. Yes.  I should have thought it
would be possible, though it is extremely difficult in practice to do it. There isa great deal of argument between members of the committee as to how to frame^any &apos; D&apos; notice so that it would be acceptable to everybody, remembering thatit is voluntary.Q. Quite, yes. What do you think is the range of meaning today for this phrase &quot; Secret intelligence and counter intelligence methods and activities&quot;?Are there any secret methods? A. Oh yes, I think there are quite a number.Q. Give me one or two instances, would you? We have run through the mainforms of this kind of intelligence activity the opening of letters, telephone tapping, looking at cables, bugging in all its various forms, listening devices,photographic devices-they are all studied in books which deal with these thingsand are to some extent common knowledge, so they could all be written about ingeneral as employed by our agents? A. I think they can be written about ingeneral, provided the thing is very much a generalisation. It is very importantI think not to publish anything which particularises and says &quot; This is being donehere &quot; or &quot; to him &quot;.Q. Or &quot; This is being introduced &quot; A. Or &quot; This is being introduced &quot;, yes.Q. So if I may put it this way, without prejudice, what saved Mr. Pincher&apos;sarticle from the point of view of the &apos; D &apos; notice was that he said it was regular andhad been going on at an equal pace for a long time? A. Well, I think it wasa very important part.Mr. Shinwell: Mr. Howard, why did you resign from the Press and Broadcast-ing Committee? Was it because you were disturbed about what appeared to bean attack on the Daily Express and Mr. Chapman, in the course of a statement made in the House by the Prime Minister? What was the cause of it? A. Itwas because the Prime Minister said that the &apos; D&apos; Notice Committee would haveto consider the case of Mr. Pincher and the Daily Express. In my view it was nothing whatsoever to do with the &apos; D&apos; Notice Committee. It is a body whichwas formed for no other purpose than to compose &apos; D&apos; notices, and it cannotsit in judgment on anybody, whether they obey or disobey the notice, and I feltthat for any member of that committee to consider the case of Mr. Pincher andthe Daily Express was completely wrong and should not be done.Q. And that was your only reason? A. That was my principal reason, yes.Q. You did not attempt in any way to engage in conversation with the PrimeMinister, perhaps to ascertain whether he had made an error?-A. No.Q. You did not think that was necessary? A. Well, no ; I do not really feeleither that I am in a position to do so.Q. When did you first hear the story which Mr. Chapman Pincher wrote inthe Express! Do you know anybody named Lawson, who has been mentionedin connection with this affair? A. No. I know somebody called Lawson,but . . .Q. Was the Daily Mirror never approached to write a story about this? A. No.Q. You are aware that several other newspapers were?-A. I know the daily mail had a story, but I do not know anything about it as far as the DailyMirror is concerned. We did not have the story.Q. Do you regard it as an important story? A. Oh yes, I was very interestedwhen I read it in the Daily Express.Q. And you would have published it yourself? A. I think so, subject to anything which Colonel Lohan might have said to me.Q. But you say this was just a routine affair? A. What was a routine affair,sir?Q. This cable vetting is generally known? A. Yes, I should have thought so.Q. But still a very important story? A. Yes, it is.Q. A sensational story? A. Yes, I think so.Q. Something which is generally known? A. Yes, certainly. I do not by&quot; generally known&quot; mean known to eveiy member of the public, I mean
generally known in espionage circles, and I think it is a sensational story asfar as the public is concerned, to know that cables are being regularly vetted.Q. Why do you think that? Do you think it is an invasion of somebody&apos;sprivacy?-A. Yes, I do, as counsel just read out, there is a general feeling ofgreat distaste about this.Q. Have you had any indications from any quarter that anybody&apos;s privacy wasinvaded?   Was yours invaded, for example? A. I have no idea.Q. Or Mr. Cecil King&apos;s privacy? A. I do not know.Q. Or anybody connected with the Mirror! A. I do not know.Q. So this would be a speculation on your part about somebody&apos;s privacybeing invaded? A. No. I think the vetting of cables is obviously an invasion of privacy.Q. You apparently make a distinction in interpreting the purpose and theauthority behind a &apos;D&apos; notice; would you regard it as merely a guide-line? A. Yes, I suppose I would really, but it is a little more than that. It is a ratherstrong request, and it should generally be obeyed by editors, because it has been written in their name by their representatives.Q. Have you any recollection of occasions when it has not been obeyed? A. I have, but I cannot remember the occasion. I believe there was an occasionwhen the Daily Telegraph avoided a &apos; D&apos; notice, but I do not know what theoccasion was.Chairman: We had references to a case of a Russian defector. A. Was thatit?   I really cannot remember which occasion it was.Mr. Shinwell: Would you not say that the boundary between what youdescribe as a particular operation a specific operation, which is relevant to a&apos; D&apos; notice-and a general operation of a routine character is a very narrowboundary? A. That is a very difficult question to answer. There is a boundary,they are two different sets of circumstances. How does one define how wide the boundary is?Q. I put it in this way: if in the opinion of an appropriate government depart-ment, those responsible for security, in any government, there is a suggestionthat even a routine operation, about which a story is about to be published,might have the effect of impinging on the national security, would you notconsider that that is a matter which requires very careful consideration? A. Certainly I do.Q. Then in this particular instance, when Colonel Lohan, who is the Secretaryof the Press &amp; Broadcasting Committee, approached Mr. Chapman Pincher overa number of days, with general and frequent conversations and trying to impress upon him first of all that the &apos; D &apos; notice was relevant, and then, when he failedto do so, made a request to him on the grounds of general security, and that was followed up by a request by the Foreign Secretary to Sir Max Aitken, et cetera,would you not consider, from your vast experience in these matters, andparticularly as a member of the Press &amp; Broadcasting Committee, that it called for perhaps a little caution on the part of a newspaper? A. Well, I imagine it received very careful consideration.Q. But you know that the reason it was published was exclusively andprimarily because it was not related to a &apos; D &apos; notice? A. Well, I do not workon the Daily Express.Q. That is your misfortune, I presume. A. I expect you are right, Sir.Q. When stories of this kind are bruited about, naturally a newspaper likethe Daily Mirror will be glad to print one? A. Delighted, yes.Q. It is the first newspaper in the country which would be anxious to print asensational story with great respect to the Daily Express you like to get itfirst? A. Certainly.
Q. If you had got this story you would have published it? A. I have saidthat I cannot really answer the question, because I do not know what was said by Colonel Lohan to the Daily Express, but I would certainly have been inclined to publish it, from my limited knowledge of the facts.Q. I do not know, I am a novice in these matters, but do newspapers usuallyknow what other newspapers are going to publish, when a good story is about?- -A. I think you can tell when a good story is about, if it is a general happening,but not necessarily this sort of thing, no.Q. You did not think this was a good story? A. Yes, I did.Q. Now, in retrospect, you regard it as a good story? A. I think it is an excellent story.Q. Quite sensational? A. Yes.Q. But you heard nothing about it at all? A. Nothing whatsoever.Q. You did not know it was going to be published? A. No, I did not how could I have done?Q. And you may have been surprised to know that the Daily Mail knew the story? A. I was surprised.Q. So knowledge which was within the compass of the Daily Mail was notavailable to the Daily Mirror? -A. That is right, it was not.Q. Generally speaking, would you not agree with me that even if the &apos; D &apos;notice was not valid, not relevant to an incident of this kind, when a requestis made by the Secretary of the Press &amp; Broadcasting Committee and by theForeign Secretary, it might as well not be published?-No, sir.   I think the secretary of the committee in the first place is no more than the secretaryof the committee and he has no authority of any kind, he is the servant of thecommittee. As far as the Foreign Secretary is concerned, I do not knowanything about what he may have done in this matter at all, I do not know what he said, I do not know to whom he spoke. I have merely heard that he issaid to have spoken to Sir Max Aitken.Q. This is a hypothetical question, but supposing you had been in this situation: you had been approached by the Foreign Secretary, making a request to you not to publish a story which the Government, I will not say in theirwisdom, but in their discretion, considered impinged on our security, what wouldyour reaction have been? A. My reaction would have been, as I imaginethe reaction of the Express was, to say: &quot; I am dreadfully sorry, we already haveprinted it&quot;.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Mr. Howard, you were a member of the Press &amp; Broad-casting Committee for two or three years? A. Yes.Q. In your view did it work satisfactorily during that time? A. Verysatisfactorily.Q. Are there any improvements which you can suggest in the way it should work? A. No, except that I do feel that we could probably, and particularlyin the light of this case, rewrite some of the &apos; D &apos; notices with advantage, tomake them more precise.Q. Mr. Marks has been putting a rather different point of view to us; hesaid it is very important to leave them rather vague, that if you made them more precise then it would look as though they were statutory regulations or some-thing like that. A. I do not mean that precise ; I think they could be tidiedup a little and made more explicit. There is not for example a reference to cables,and I would have thought it would have been useful to have included that.Q. When Colonel Lohan, who as you say is the servant of the committee, goesand argues, supposing he fails, do you think there ought to be any machinerywhereby his failure could be referred again to the committee, before publica-tion? A. I do not think it is practicable.   I do not see how it could be done.Q. A possible idea was that the papers should agree that if there is a disagree-ment of that sort there would be a sort of stop for a limited period. A. I wouldbe very reluctant to agree to that, on behalf of my newspaper.
Q. Because of competitors getting the story? A. Indeed, yes.Chairman: There is one question, which arose out of what Mr. Shinwell put to you: we know you resigned from the Press &amp; Broadcasting Committee andI do not want to travel over the reasons, but is it your view that in no circum-stances can that committee charge itself with complaints against a newspaperfor not observing, even in a clear case, its requirements? A. Yes, that is my view, sir.Q. Is there any way then by which, if there is perhaps a strong feeling thatone paper has departed from what the others have observed regarding a &apos; D&apos;notice, this can be investigated? A. I do not know of any machinery at themoment. There can of course be a complaint to the Press Council, if that isof any help.Q. I was going to ask you whether you thought that would be useful orfeasible? A. I think it would be useful, because the council has a great dealof respect among journalists, and I think if the council were to condemn a newspaper for publishing something, it would be quite important.Q. Apart from that, the only possible sanction would be to withdraw the circulation of future &apos;D&apos; notices from that paper? A. I do not think thatwould be a very satisfactory sanction really, would it, because there are a numberof &apos; D &apos; notices, and one is not achieving anything by not telling newspapersabout them.Q. No, all you would achieve is that you would leave them in some un-certainty about whether they were really doing harm or possibly going outsidethe Official Secrets Act? A. Yes, and then of course you would have to have an expert on the Official Secrets Act in your office.Chairman: Yes. Thank you very much.(The witness withdrew)Mr. E. Pickering called examined by Sir Peter rawlinson. Mr. Edward Pickering, you are a director of the International PublishingCompany? A. Yes.Q. The editorial director of the Daily Mirror Newspapers Ltd., and a memberof the Press Council? A. Yes.Q. You were managing editor of the Daily Express from 1951 to 1956, andeditor from 1956 to 1962?-A. I was.Q. You have also taken a special interest in and had much experience ofdefence matters? A. That is so, yes.Q. In 1965 did you advise the Minister of Defence, at his invitation, on information and public relations inside the Ministry? A. I did.Q. In your career have you had much experience of security problems and* D &apos; notices?-A. Yes.Q. I think you included something about &apos; D&apos; notice procedure in the speech which you had to make to the Academy of Forensic Science in 1964?-A. I did.Q. You knew Admiral Thomson very well? A. Yes.Q. And his successor, Colonel Lohan? A. Yes.Q. When you were editor, was Mr. Pincher the defence correspondent? A.He was.Q. Did you work with him? A. I worked with him very closely, yes.Q. Did you find him a man of reliability and integrity? A. At all times, yes.Q. I think you did have two occasions between 1956 and 1962* when there was some discussion that the Express had then marginally gone over the &apos; D&apos; noticeboundary? A. Yes, I did.
Q. And that was discussed with you and Admiral Thomson and Mr. Pincher? A. Yes, and the matter was resolved by my writing a letter to AdmiralThomson explaining the circumstances, and Admiral Thomson accepted the explanation.Q. Did Admiral Thomson speak to you on many occasions about Mr. Pincher&apos;sreliability and ability? A. He did, he spoke veiy highly of him as the outstandingdefence correspondent, and paid tribute not only to his ability but to his integrityalso.Q. I think immediately prior to 1956, at the time of Suez, the operations in theMiddle East, you often had to go and see the then Minister of Defence, SirWalter Monckton? A. I did, yes.Q. With Admiral Thomson?-A. Yes.Q. And you had a lot of discussions then about military matters and &apos; D&apos;notice procedures? A. Yes.Q. It was a time I suppose when there was much of this going on? A.Many secrets about, yes.Q. Did Mr. Pincher ever, when you were editor, let you down over any matter of security? A. No, not at any time.Q. Were there many &apos; D&apos; notices at that time? A. Many more, I suspect,than there have been in the last few years.Q. What was his attitude, when you were editor, to &apos; D&apos; notices? Was hethe kind of man who would lightly disregard a &apos; D&apos; notice? A. No, not at all.Q. When you were editor did you also know Mr. Derek Marks? A. I did.Q. Was he then the diplomatic-. A.  and political correspondent, yes.Q. Was he involved in defence matters? A. From time to time he was, yes.Q. Is he a man who had experience of&apos; D &apos; notices? A. He had, yes.Q. What was his attitude when you were his editor, towards generally &apos; D1notice procedure? A. At all times he would discuss the matters with me, andif there were any questions at all they were referred to Admiral Thomson.Q. Did he strike you as a person of reliability? A. Yes.Q. We will turn now to the story which is before you, and the &apos; D &apos; noticeswhich are also before you. What do you say now, if you were looking at thatstory and at those &apos; D&apos; notices, would it have occurred to you that the &apos; D &apos;notices applied to that story? A. No. I have read the &apos; D &apos; notices, and I wouldnot have formed that view.Q. My lord, I do not propose asking in detail, I am leaving it to the com-mittee about &apos; D&apos; notices. What do you understand about the procedure, if thesecretary says that a &apos; D&apos; notice applies to any particular story? What wouldyou do, in your experience as editor, if the secretary is saying to you that a&apos; D &apos; notice applies? A. If he rules that a &apos; D &apos; notice applies, then in my viewan editor would act upon that at once, and if necessary challenge it later. Itwould depend on the way it was put to him, I imagine, but in my view a state-ment, a forthright statement that it was a direct contravention of a &apos; D&apos; notice,would cause any editor to stop and then go into discussion with Colonel Lohan.Q. May I put this in another way: if a &apos; D&apos; notice applies, and if an editoris determined to stay within the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure and not break it, is therethen left to him any discretion to publish, or must he not publish, to keep withinthe procedure? A. There is always discretion left to the editor. He is notbound by anything, but once the &apos; D&apos; notice is clearly applied to a story then he acts accordingly.Q. When you say he acts accordingly, what do you mean by that? A. Ifthe &apos; D&apos; notice applies to the story, then he does not use it. If he is merelytold that the &apos; D&apos; notice does apply then he is at liberty to challenge.
Q. We know there is nothing enforceable about the &apos; D &apos; notice, but, workingthe voluntary system, where &apos; D &apos; notices do apply, if you want to stay withinthe voluntary system then you do not publish? A. You do not publish.Q. Now suppose &apos;D&apos; notices do not apply, but you get a request by one member of the committee, namely the secretary, not to publish, what is the posi-tion of the editor then? A. It is a matter for the editor&apos;s discretion.Q. I think this is common ground and I can lead you: is there not in exis-tence an emergency procedure which is provided for cases where the secretaryfeels he must take action, emergency action? A. Yes, there is.Q. What is the purpose of having an emergency procedure, as you under-stand it? A. So that if a case arises where there is doubt about the applicationof a &apos; D&apos; notice to a particular story, the secretary can in fact call a fewmembers of the committee together and get a ruling, and issue a private and confidential letter if he so wishes, in order to draw attention to some specificmatter not covered by the &apos; D &apos; notice.Chairman: You say &quot; members of the committee&quot;: they would be pressmembers, would they not? A. Yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Where a matter has been under discussion for several days, and an editor learns that it has been under discussion for several days, andhe understands that &apos; D &apos; notices do not apply but he is getting a request fromthe secretary, would the absence of any private and confidential letter be of any importance, do you think? A. Yes. I would take the view that if the storyhad been known to Colonel Lohan for some days, and I had not received eithersome direct approach or I had not received a private and confidential letter, thenI would assume that it was in my discretion to publish.Q. In your view could there be any criticism of an editor, if he is informed that&apos; D &apos; notices do not apply but the secretary is requesting him not to publish,would there be any criticism of an editor publishing in those circumstances? A. No.Q. Looking at the story, quite apart from the security element which arises from the vetting of cables, is there in your view any other public interest elementfrom that particular cable vetting story? A. I think there is a very highgeneral interest in the particular story that Chapman Pincher wrote.Q. When you use the word &quot; interest&quot;, the public could be interested in thematrimonial affairs of a film star, but in what sense are you using the word&quot;interest&quot;? A. Interest in cable vetting and the extension of it to all cablesand telegrams.Q. Do you agree with the attitude which was taken by the former report ofPrivy Councillors, that interception generally of letters, telegrams and telephonesis regarded with general disfavour?- A. Yes.Q. Have you been told the sequence of events and the situation which facedMr. Marks on 20th February, 1967? A. I have and I am quite satisfied that ifI had been faced with a similar problem I would have acted exactly as he didunder the present rules of procedure.(At this stage the proceedings were adjourned for a short time)Evidence of Mr. E. Pickering resumedChairman: Mr. Pickering, page 3 of the statement that you gave us, the second half of that page I have to ask you a question or two about, because I did not feel I really followed this. You are talking about the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure. A.Yes.Q. You say:  &quot; As I understand the procedure, if the Secretary of the &apos; D&apos; notice Com-mittee says that a &apos; D &apos; notice applies to any particular story it would notbe used, even if the editor concerned thought that the Secretary&apos;s rulingwas wrong.&quot;Now it cannot work out quite as simple as that, can it? You see, there is noquestion of rulings here at all, is there? Nobody has any authority to give,rulings. A. No.
Q. I can imagine in your experience with Admiral Thomson and colonel lohan that a view starts on the side of the Secretary that a &apos; D&apos; notice applies&apos; to a story, or a form of the story, which is more often the way it comes out. A. Yes.Q. And the Express correspondent or editor does not agree. He says, &quot;Itdoes not read this way, and it has not been applied this way.&quot; This must be a legitimate sphere of debate? A. Oh yes.Q. It is not just the secretary saying it then. It is the secretary after discussionrefusing to accept that it is not within a &apos; D &apos; notice, is it not? A. Yes. If he came back to me and spoke quite clearly and decisively that something that I was going to publish in our paper was a direct contravention of a &apos; D &apos; notice, I wouldhave to accept that ruling, but I would also reserve the right to immediatelydebate it again with him.Q. You mean until you had over persuaded him you would not actuallypublish? A. No.Q. Has there never been a case in the past when you could not agree with each other, you firmly maintaining that it really had nothing to do with &apos; D&apos;notices? A. I have never experienced it, no.Q. You see here I think Mr. Chapman Pincher&apos;s story is that he really thoughtthat it was virtually absurd to say these &apos; D &apos; notices covered this story. A.Yes.Q. He would not, in a sense, attend to this argument. A. Yes.Q. What happens then in your experience of the procedure? Does he have togo back and say to his editor, &quot; I think this is quite unreasonable and not the wayit works&quot;? A. Yes, I would have thought that he then reported to his editor,and in my view if the matter had been a contravention of a &apos; D&apos; notice in thenormal way the secretary of the committee would be in touch with the editor,having spoken to the defence correspondent, because the defence correspondentin this case is only an intermediary, and it is the editor who must decide whetherthe story goes into the paper or not.Q. I am sure that is right, and it is possibly the case that Mr. chapman pincher&apos;s position with regard to &apos; D &apos; notices bearing on his subject is veryinfluential. A. Certainly.Q. But suppose the correspondent then parts with the secretary saying, &quot; Isimply do not think your argument is right at all, I do not think this is coveredby &apos; D&apos; notices&quot;, do you say he ought to go back to his editor and tell him, &quot; Iam quite clear myself, but this is what the secretary says &quot;? A. Yes.Q. What happens then? Is it a matter for the editor&apos;s discretion to agree withthe defence correspondent and publish, or is he still under what you think isa ban until he can get the secretary to alter it? A. No, I would have thoughtthat it is then up to the editor&apos;s discretion. &apos;*Q. It does not bind the editor if he takes a clear view the &apos; D&apos; notice is beingwrongly interpreted by the secretary? A. No. In all my experience if that sort of situation had arisen, then I would have expected the secretary of the com-mittee to be in fact in touch with the editor.Q. You go on to say at the bottom of uiat page: - &quot; An editor or defence correspondent might subsequently question the ruling by referring it to the secretary and if need be to the committee. Thisis the correct procedure  &quot;but it is not feasible, is it, to refer it to the committee? This is, after all, possibly a fairly hot story which he wants to publish. You cannot treat the committee as a sort of appeal committee and wait until they have been got together? A. You can inform the secretary, and, as I understand it, there is procedure forcalling together at very short notice a small number of members of the com-mittee who could in fact discuss the case.Q. An emergency meeting? A. Yes.Q. To whom he could put his case? A. Yes.
Q. And see whether they would then send out some general warning, I take it?-A. Yes.Q. To everybody? A. Yes.Q. And even though it was an exclusive story you would not think that was wrong procedure? A. No.Q. Of course quite apart from other papers in this country possibly being held back by the &apos; D &apos; notice, there is the question of the story being brokenabroad, is there not? A. Yes.Q. You say on the next page: -&quot; In my view, and I believe this to be correct, publication by one news-paper of a story that is subject to a &apos; D &apos; notice does not permit others tofollow.&quot;Is that view universally held? A. I do not know whether it is universally held.It is certainly one that I hold.Q. Is it not a highly debatable view? Is not the argument constantly brought up that the only reason for stopping it is security, and now it is out and thereis no harm in further publication?-A. I have heard both arguments put in fact,but it is still my view that merely because there has been contravention of a&apos; D &apos; notice I do not see publication by another newspaper is automatic.Q. You have I would have thought fairly often come across cases when thefact that it has been out in one paper has been regarded by other papers asopening the matter to them, have you not? A. Yes.Q. Now I will just follow up your next paragraph:&quot; As I understand the procedure, if it was considered necessary on security grounds to prevent the publication of a story which was not specificallycovered by a &apos; D &apos; notice, or in respect of which doubt was felt, whether a&apos; D &apos; notice applies or not, the Secretary could have delivered to the editora private and confidential letter containing a formal request not to publish &quot;.This private and confidential letter reference is confusing to me.   Do you meansimply a letter from him as secretary to the individual editor, or something that had been preceded by the emergency committee? A. It would be preceded by the emergency committee.Q. He had to find time and means to get together his emergency committee? A. Yes.Q. And get them then to put their authority, in so far as it is authority, behinda general appeal on this particular point to editors? A. Yes.Chairman: That is what I thought you would mean.Mr. Shinwell: You were present, Mr. Pickering, when I asked Mr. Lee Hov/ardwhy he resigned from the committee? A. Yes. &apos;-Q. I think I am correct that his reply was that he was not prepared to be involved in a dispute which concerned one newspaper? A. Yes.Q. But on page 3 and his lordship has just been asking a question about this you say if a question arises whether it is a valid &apos; D &apos; notice, it can be referred tothe secretary and if need be to the committee. Does that square with the reasonfor Mr. Lee Howard&apos;s resignation from the committee? If a matter of this sort can be referred to the committee, and it is understood that it can be, thenwhy was it necessary for him to resign from the committee because he did not want to be involved in a dispute of this kind? A. I think Mr. Lee Howardresigned because in this case the committee would only be dealing in fact withthe text of the &apos; D &apos; notice, whereas what was suggested, and why Mr. Lee Howardresigned, was that the committee should be asked to judge the actions of Mr.Chapman Pincher.Q. The actions of Mr. Pincher were related to the question of whether therewas a &apos; D&apos; notice or not? A. Certainly, related, but Mr. Lee Howard&apos;s view,as I understand it, is that the function of the committee is only to deal with&apos; D &apos; notices and to be the liaison between the authorities and the newspapers.
Q. Again on page 3 you say that it never would have occurred to you thatthe &apos; D&apos; notices in question could possibly apply to Mr. Pincher&apos;s story on cable vetting.   I follow that.  Then you say:  &quot;. . . if the secretary of the &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee says that a &apos; D &apos; noticeapplies to any particular story it would not be used, even if the editorconcerned thought that the secretary&apos;s ruling was entirely wrong.&quot;If Colonel Lohan expressed the view that this was related to the &apos; D &apos; notice,would his view not be acceptable? A. No, he would have to say that it wasa direct contravention of the &apos; D&apos; notice I think, not just related to the &apos; D&apos;notice.Q. A direct contravention of the &apos; D &apos; notice. I should have thought thatrelated to the &apos; D&apos; notice and if the &apos; D &apos; notice was valid in these circumstancesis pretty much the same thing. A. No, I do not think so. I think there is agreat difference between drawing attention to the fact that the &apos; D&apos; notice relates to the story, and claiming that the story is a direct contravention of the notice.Q. You take the view that if in the opinion of the secretary of the committee this was a breach of the &apos; D &apos; notice, that would be acceptable? A. No, I saidthat it would give me reason to pause, and I would if I thought necessary resume the argument, but I would give weight to his opinion naturally.Chairman: Thank you.(The witness withdrew)Sir Peter Rawlinson: That concludes all the witnesses I seek to put before thecommittee, and now if I may sum up this part of it? As.I have said, in orderto shorten that summing up, which is obviously not a matter for oratory, I have submitted submissions which if I may I would like to take the committee throughas the various arguments on behalf of Beaverbrook Newspapers and the individuals concerned. It will necessarily mean, if I may with respect suggest, that if thecommittee would follow me through it it would be of very great assistance tome, rather than if they went ahead, because there are. one or two points I wouldlike to stress shortly.What I have sought to do on this part, because it is quite clearly, I think I need hardly say, of great importance to the individuals concerned, is to set out what are the issues which have arisen following the establishment of this com-mittee and the various statements. So I have tried to clarify the issues concerningthese persons into five, and they all arise from the statements that have beenmade, and they would be then I think more easily dealt with.First of all, obviously, was there a clear breach of two &apos; D &apos; notices, and was there a breach of &apos; D&apos; notice procedure or convention, and that includes thespirit of the &apos; D&apos; notices. If there was any breach, was it deliberate ; in other words if a technical breach, but was it a deliberate breach? If there was a breach, was it made despite repeated warnings given before publication? Then,my lord, I have put together, were Sir Max Aitken, Derek Marks and chapman pincher (or any of them) guilty of bad faith? because it does seem to me oneinterpretation can be that this was a matter of bad faith.First of all then I turn to the story which is the routine cable vetting. It isnot a story which has only one element, namely security, such as the capacityof a particular aircraft, or the range of a particular weapon, or a particularinvestigation. It is a story which had certain other elements in it. It certainlyhad the security element the committee will know more about that than anyof us because you have papers before you which we have not before us but to look at it as the editor looks at it, he sees the security element, and he also seesin it the element of the interference with personal liberty or privacy arising fromgeneral interception and study of private documents by Government officials,and he sees indeed also the context of the recent controversy over telephone tapping, and therefore political interest which must arise out of a story of thiskind. The story is not one plum and plain of security only, and there are theother elements within it.
I turn then secondly to the actual &apos; D&apos; notice procedure or convention, andirrespective of the evidence that has been given before you in committee I takethe elements of the procedure or convention from the Radcliffe Report of 1962,page 35, paragraph 124, and there and over the page I have cited each of thedifferent parts of that procedure which are referred to in that part of their report.It sets out there that they are letters of request or advice to editors warning if a story is protected under Official Secrets Acts, or, secondly, requesting ban onpublication as contrary to the national interest. Then again you see what theyare. They are approved in draft by the committee with its press element, whichis in a majority, and the letters are only sent with their agreement, and clearcases of national prejudice of &quot; a military &quot; nature, and that is stressed throughoutthat report, must be made out. There is specifically provided within the convention or procedure an emergency system which consists of the secretary issuing &apos; D &apos;notices on his own if he obtains the concurrence of now 3, formerly 2, pressmembers. Then there is a quotation from paragraph 143 that the &apos; D &apos; notice system does encroach upon the delicate subject of press freedom, and to operatesuccessfully it must not be subjected to over-strain, and this basic condition ofits existence, namely the encroachment of freedom, must be kept in mind.Then the respect for &apos; D&apos; notices is contingent upon their confinement to&quot; military&quot; matters, and any attempt to go outside it is liable to be regarded with suspicion and be resented if a notice is thought to be &quot; dictated by political considerations &quot;.My lord, there are all the matters which are taken from that paragraph andthose pages of the report.Chairman: I know &quot;military&quot; is in inverted commas. Did we give any sort of indication of what &quot;military&quot; was to cover? A. Yes. On page 36 it &quot;is described as being &apos; naval, military and air matters the publication of whichwould be prejudicial to the national interest&apos;&quot;.   Then it goes on:  &quot; The Press do not in fact insist on any rigid interpertation of the wording of this formula, so long as a clear case of national prejudice of &apos; a military&apos;nature can be made out&quot;again in inverted commas, so by &quot; military &quot; I should have thought it is accepted that it has got to be something which is of a character which can do harm to the state by an outside enemy, or I suppose an inside enemy, but certainlyharm to the state by an enemy.By that &quot; military &quot; used in inverted commas throughout the report of 1962 and I have put it here in inverted commas from that I distil for your considera-tion that the basic elements must be therefore the military character of thesubject, that it does emanate from a committee on which the Press are amajority, and there must be absence of any political or official considerations.Bearing therefore in mind this particular story, and a particular element in it,and the procedure or convention as it has been understood in the past, then Iturn to the first issue of was there a breach of the two * D&apos; notices.This turns of course, I accept, on the construction of the terms of the &apos; D&apos;notices, but what I do submit is they are certainly not legal documents, andit is unreasonable to expect them to be construed as such. Whereas someonelooking at a document would construe it or interpret it in one way, it has tobe borne in mind that it comes from a committee on which journalists are inthe majority, and they go to help other journalists. Therefore it must be interpreted, if any accusation is to be upheld by the breach of two &apos; D &apos; notices,it must be looked at from the journalists point of view.Secondly, the purpose has to be borne in mind, and the purpose is not to conceal from the British public what officialdom is doing, their purpose is quite clear, which is to avoid revealing security secrets to potential enemies or enemiesof the United Kingdom. That is clear from that report, which is the currentreport, at paragraph 133 where it says:  &quot;In our view the system makes a valuable and effective contributionto protecting from disclosure &apos;military&apos; information which needs to beconcealed and which it would be useful to other Powers to possess.&quot;
So it is not to conceal what their officials are up to, but it is to conceal anything which might help potential enemies.And so in the proper interpretation of the &apos; D &apos; notice, I suggest, of whether an intelligence &quot; method&quot; is secret, or is one of common knowledge, the testmust be applied whether or not such method could reasonably be anticipatedto be known to persons with some security knowledge, and especially of course to foreign security services and agents.This is what they are all about, because there is no form of censorship, andthis is a voluntary system. It is to help everybody to avoid the state beingharmed, and the state is only going to be harmed by potential enemies of thestate.So if that is the right way of construing &apos; D&apos; notices, not, as has beensuggested, like a regulation or deed, applying that test, could foreign security or any security reasonably be expected to know the cables would be vetted?Of course, as I have said on several occasions in the course of the evidence,maybe there are persons living wherever it is which are reached by the daily express who would not know and did not know that cables are vetted, but would the persons who are concerned in security matters or potential enemies beexpected to know that cables could be vetted?I think the reply is that to many at any rate certain cable vetting is commonknowledge, and some indication can be given by the fact that the Post office or the cable authorities require only certain codes to be used, which must meanthose cables are liable to a certain extent to be scrutinised.Thirdly the Birkett Report, which was the last committee of Privy Councillorsset up on this matter, referred to cable vetting, and they deal in very strongterms in different parts of that report with the disfavour with which all inter-ception is regarded, but it goes on to reassure, and the principal reason forreassurance is that interception is only selective, and as interception is onlyselective, therefore that allays, or ought to, the anxiety.In the report it is not confined, of course, to telephone tapping. It was all communications and all the different parts that I have referred to in the courseof evidence, and I need not take you through them, except to paragraph 120of it, where it shows the details of this selective interception, and this was theposition in 1957. Of course it would be idle to imagine a foreign securityagency who had not read this report or that it would not have been before thesecurity official.  In paragraph 120 at page 27 they write:  &quot; We are in particular aware of the danger of disclosing even on a singleoccasion the extent of interception for security purposes. The best coursetherefore seems to us to group the figures for interceptions for each ofthe years from 1937-56 under these heads (1) interceptions by security, Police, Customs and Post Office ;(2) interceptions in connection with dangerous drugs, lotteries and obscene publications.We set out these figures in Appendix I, Table I. From this Table itappears that the average annual number of interceptions of telephone linesfrom 1937 to 1956 was 130. The corresponding figure for interception of letters and telegrams was 501.&quot;So they were setting out the average number of interceptions of letters andtelegrams in the period 1937-56, and the fact of course that there was cableinterception or letter interception cannot be said in my submission to be something which was to disclose or breach a secret. Appendix I which appears at page41 deals with telephones and letters, and shows that it does not deal withtelegrams, though it does deal with them in Scotland.Chairman: No, it does not separate telegrams.Sir Peter Rawlinson: It does over the page where you deal with Scodand,where in 1952 one telegram was intercepted by the Crown Office, but it doesnot separate really telephones and telegrams.
Chairman: It has said in the body of the report when it speaks of lettersit includes telegrams.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes. &quot;The corresponding figure for interception of letters and telegrams was 501 &quot; and at page 16 there is a note &quot;&apos; letters&apos;includes postal packets and telegrams except where they are expressly excluded,&quot;Therefore it is interception of telegrams in the same way as interception of letters,because I think it has been said by one witness that if suddenly a story came to him that the whole of the mail was being intercepted he would not considerthat this was a secret method or secret intelligence method, and something which to reveal in the newspaper was suddenly to reveal to potential enemies the factthat the security services were intercepting letters. So the editor is entitled surelyto have regard to that report of those Privy Councillors who dealt with the matter.So that interception was something which has to be taken seriously and it isregarded with general disfavour in the view of those Privy Councillors, and, asI say, some comfort can be taken from the fact that it is done very rarely.Then, secondly, would an editor, examining these &apos; D&apos; notices of 1956, 1957and 1961, appreciate that they applied to a cable vetting story? Now, my lord,a point has been made that the 1957 one does seem to take telephone tappingout of the security mask. It does of course refer to this report, and this is thereport in fact which deals with interception of all communications, so I supposeit could be said, but I do not press it, as it refers to the report it must refer toall the matters in the report, but it is quite clear, the view of the editors that have been called before you and they are representative I would suggest that they do not think that interception of letters or cables, or even Mr. Greenfears, telephone tapping was a matter which was a secret method.So my submission on that would the editors examining these &apos; D &apos; noticesclearly appreciate they applied to a cable vetting story? my submission is No,they would not, and in support of that there has been called before you Mr.Green. I do not need to take all his evidence, you heard it this morning. you have heard Mr. Lee Howard and Mr. Pickering. There are also the quotations,because we have not been able to bring everybody before you, but there arethe quotations from The Times, the Observer and the New Statesman, whichI would like just if I may to remind you of. We have put them together ina bundle which I think you have.If you will turn to the last one, The Times, of Wednesday, 22nd February,which is the day after, if I may take extracts from it, I will take the second paragraph in the first column:  &quot; As the Prime Minister correctly said confidence and trust are the basisof the whole system. But the confidence and trust must be mutual. Editorsare expected to comply with &apos; D &apos; notices. Equally &apos; D &apos; notices are expectedto be reserved for matters where the public interest clearly counsels secrecy.On the face of it the Daily Express disclosure does^ not fulfil the secondcondition. There is no &apos; D&apos; notice explicitly referring to the interception of cables. It was held that the question fell under two other notices of someyears&apos; standing concerning deciphering and the activities of the intelligenceservices.   The Express disputed this, and reasonably so.If its story is anywhere near correct, it discloses a practice about whichthe public has cause to be concerned. The extent to which the police and security services intercept private communications is something which goes tothe root of civil liberties and about which Parliament and public havefrequently shown anxiety.&quot;Then it gives a quotation from the report of the 1957 Privy Councillors, andthen it says:  &quot; And Governments have since sworn fidelity to that practice. The vettingof external cables, as described by the Daily Express, answers to none ofthose stringent conditions.   It sounds like an open licence to screen at will.But, said the Prime Minister, the Express^ published an &apos; inaccurate storypurporting to describe a situation in which, in fact, the powers and practicehave not changed for well over forty years&apos;.  If the story is wildly inaccurate,
why invoke &apos; D &apos; notices? It would not be disclosing anything of value to foreign intelligence agencies since it would not be disclosing anything atall. &apos; D &apos; notices were not intended for spy fiction. And if the practicehas indeed not been changed for over forty years, is it credible that foreignintelligence agencies should be unaware of it until alerted by the daily express? &quot;That was the view of The Times. And you have had the editor of the telegraph, and the editor of the Mirror. Making a selection, I would ask you to look at the Observer of 26th February, which is headed &quot; Lloyd joining &apos; D &apos;notice probe &quot; and it says there in the second column:  &quot; Andrew Wilson writes: Two important points emerged yesterday aboutthe Daily Express &apos; D &apos; notice affair and will certainly be discussed at the privy Council committee examination.First, although there was expert advice that a genuine security breach wouldbe involved if the Daily Express went ahead with its disclosure about cable vetting, Whitehall was mainly concerned to prevent the disclosure on adifferent score.The paragraph in Tuesday&apos;s Daily Express article which aroused mostconcern in the Government was that which said: &apos; while the cables arebeing vetted there is nothing to prevent information being passed to theExchequer, the Board of Trade, or any other interested department.&apos; &quot;Then it goes on in the third paragraph:  &quot;Secondly, Mr. Wilson&apos;s contention that the Daily Express story contra-intervened two &apos; D&apos; notices is hard to sustain, either from a scrutiny of the &apos; D &apos;notices or from accounts of the interview between the Daily Express DefenceCorrespondent, Mr. Chapman Pincher, and the secretary of the Services,Press and Broadcasting Committee, Colonel Lohan.What, in fact, they appear to have discussed was the security servicedargument. ...&quot;and it is saying it is hard to sustain, which was the view of that newspaper.Then there is the quotation from the New Statesman, of 24th February, 1967,which is the editor writing in his journal there:  &quot;What should concern us in the row between Mr. Wilson and the daily express is not whether Chapman Pincher defied &apos; D &apos; notices (I don&apos;t thinkhe did, and anyway the point is arguable), but the further evidence Pincherprovided of the governments invasion of privacy.&quot;The others are groups from which you have heard people in person, but thatcovers a very wide spectrum of the press, if this is a clear breach of two &apos; D &apos;notices, because all those editors who appeared before you and all those who have written down there thought that was the position, rightly or wrongly, but thisis their interpretation, and if you are going to accept it ought to be a journalistsinterpretation there seems to be unanimity throughout the whole of the press that this was not under &apos; D&apos; notice, and certainly was not a clear breach. Theymay be wrong on their interpretation if you apply to it the dissection of balancingone part of it against the other, but nevertheless this is the view of those people who have to work this system. These are the people to whom the &apos; D &apos;notices are addressed, and these are the people who are represented as a majority on the committee which actually writes the &apos; D&apos; notices. Therefore on that position clearly there could not be a breach of &apos;D&apos; notice by journalists, let alone the editor and the correspondent of the Express.My submission (b) is really repeating what I have said about Birkett, and Ido not propose doing that. Therefore, my final submissions on this issue asto whether there was a clear breach, or that even if there was I put thisobviously with no disrespect to a lawyer&apos;s interpretation ....Chairman: I quite see your point about a lawyer&apos;s interpretation. On theother hand, if you use forms of words you have somehow or other to arrive atsome idea of what they mean.
Sir Peter Rawlinson: My lord, I would say to that that the best way you can decide what they mean is what did they mean to the people to whom it was addressed and from whom it was written.Chairman: Yes, I think that is a valid point, if I may say so.Sir Peter Rawlinson: I say here that even if under the interpretation on thebasis of I put it as a generic term a lawyer&apos;s interpretation, even if they are within a method or possibly an activity within the 1956 &apos; D &apos; notice, it was certainly not a secret method to those engaged in security and especially to foreigners, and I make the reference there to the two reports, and I say otherexperienced editors did not interpret it and, according to Colonel Lohan, who-ever briefed the Prime Minister that the cable vetting story was a clear breach of two &apos; D &apos; notices was wicked. There is unanimity on this point. Nobodywas asserting, neither the secretary of the committee nor the members, thatthere was here a clear breach of two &apos; D&apos; notices. If anything, it is certainly not clear and I suggest there has certainly not been any breach at all. So much for the first issue.I turn now to the second and third issues: Was there a breach of &apos; D &apos; noticeprocedure or convention and if so was it deliberate? because these go together.This is the second submission. The first submission was clear breach and thesecond is breach of &apos; D &apos; notice procedure or convention. My Lord, if thereis going to be a breach in this case, accepting the fact, it must be assumed that where no &apos; D&apos; notice strictly applies but where a secretary, laying aside the&apos; D&apos;, makes a request not to publish, such request is tantamount to a &apos; D &apos; andrejection constitutes a breach of the convention or procedure. That must be the finding if there is going to be said here there is a breach of convention orprocedure.First of all that indicates this is not the &apos; D &apos; system, because the &apos; D&apos; system is the system of the letter drafted by the committee, the majority of whom are members of the press. If you are going to act within its terms, procedure orconvention, that is what carries with it the warning. If a request by the secretary has equal force to a &apos; D &apos; notice then there is no point in having &apos; D &apos; notices,because you could just have the secretary going around and saying so. Theremust be a distinction between a request of the secretary and the actual applicationof the &apos; D &apos; notice. Thirdly, the secretary by himself is only one part of one side of the committee, namely the Defence Committee, the majority being thepress, and there has to be agreement of the press members ...Chairman: That is not quite right, is it. He is the servant of the press sideof the committee.Sir Peter Rawlinson: With respect, I would have thought he is certainly theservant of all the committee, but if there are two sides, the defence side andthe press side, he is certainly not the press side ; he is the official side, he isan official, although of course he acts in the name of the committee. If he wereassumed just to make his own ipse dixit on a particular point, this is an official of the defence side making it.   My lord, perhaps it is a telegramatic form . . .Chairman: I would not like there to be any misunderstanding. He is not infact a serving officer. When he took on the secretaryship, as he told us, heresigned. His function is to be secretary of this committee.Sir Peter RavAinson: He is an official paid by the Ministry of Defence.Chairman: He is paid by the Ministry of Defence, yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: He is carried as well on the strength of the Ministry,the chairman of the committee being the permanent under-secretary. Thewhole point it seems to me of the emergency procedure is not that he could get further approval of any other particular members of the committee on thedefence side, but the press people, and if a specific emergency procedure is infact provided and it is laid down what it is then this must be to cover positionswhen the secretary has formed a view but the committee has not yet been either
convened or been able to consider the point. If you do have an emergencyI procedure, that is there to be used, and if it is not prayed in aid and if it is not&quot; called in in an emergency or in a particular situation then surely the personreceiving the request is entitled to say that &apos; D&apos; notices do not apply, noemergency procedure has been called in aid; I am just faced with a request.Therefore, when we come to look at the position of &apos; D &apos; notice procedure orconvention, my submission is, and this has been supported of course by the,as it were, expert evidence, that an editor is entitled to balance against therequest given by the secretary considerations of public interest and the possibility that the request could contain elements concerning official or political embarrass-ment. Political or official embarrassment may seem to us perhaps rather far-fetched, but of course to the press it is something against which they are meant to be on guard. It may be constant war has to go on between the press andofficialdom, but they feel, unless the case is made out that this is really of amilitary nature, that they have to be always suspicious of requests, whether thisis right or wrong. In this particular case the editor considered the nature ofthe story. He told you about the public interest elements which must be putaside in the face of the Privy Councillors&apos; report of 1957, and since the &apos; Ds&apos;did not specifically apply, he used his discretion and decided to print. ThereforeI would say on this there is no evidence of a breach of procedure or of con-vention, because he was doing what he believed he was entitled to do and what his peers have come here to say in their view he was entitled so to do, namely,exercise his discretion in the face of, as Mr. Pickering said, a categorical assertionthat a &apos; D &apos; applied.My lord, I turn now to the fourth and fifth issues which arise from the allegations: were repeated warnings that the story was in breach of &apos; D&apos; noticesgiven before publication?   This is important, because the Foreign Secretary&apos;stelephone call came after publication.   Were repeated warnings that the storywas in breach of &apos; D &apos; notices given before publication, and were Sir Max Aitken,Mr. Marks and/or Mr. Pincher guilty of bad faith?   That means going quicklythrough the evidence.   First of all dealing with Mr. Pincher because he startsthe story, it is common ground that he telephoned to Colonel Lohan on theThursday and he enquired if &apos; D &apos; notices applied to a certain story, leaving asidewhat he said.  Colonel Lohan has agreed that he said to that story &apos; D&apos; noticesdid not apply, categorically.   The conflict arises because Colonel Lohan saysPincher&apos;s story was about the collection of telegrams for vetting from G.P.O.Pincher says he spoke of collection of cables for vetting from cable offices.   i suggest you look at the other evidence to see whose recollection is best on this.Wing Commander Harris in his evidence said that a little after 3 o&apos;clock Pincherhad asked him about the collection from cable offices that afternoon.  That was&quot; cable offices &quot;.   This would be before Pincher spoke to Colonel Lohan.   Wecan compare that with what Colonel Lohan said about times.   Harris said if aspokesman knew this was another point a story was under &apos; D&apos; he would say so, and Harris said nothing (which is common ground) to Pincher about&apos; Ds&apos;.Secondly, 0&apos;Brien was another person to whom Pincher spoke that afternoon, andhe says Pincher spoke of cable offices and cables.   That is categorical evidence.When it comes to a conflict, if it is to be considered judicially, there is at leastthis evidence to corroborate Mr. Pincher&apos;s version of what he said and contraryto what Colonel Lohan has said. The sequence in any event was that on the 16thPincher had been informed &apos; Ds &apos; do not apply. Then comes Friday the 17th. Herethere is a conflict, because Colonel Lohan does not recollect any conversation.Pincher says Lohan telephoned, spoke of pressure about embassies and diplomaticfurore, and asked Pincher not to write until Monday. Again looking at the otherevidence, was there this telephone conversation and was anything said in it asPincher says was said?   Colonel Lohan we know spoke to the Mail on Fridayregarding postponement and surely it must be most likely he would havespoken to Pincher of the Express on Friday.  Moreover, when the Mail finallypublished their story they included ... in their story.   That was the storywhich was read over to Colonel Lohan but he asked them to take that out Thatwas the evidence I think of Mr. Matthewman.   There was certainly something
about embassies with regard to the Mail. Further, Pincher spoke to Mr. Ebanon Saturday about diplomatic reaction to the story being given; and thirdly we know the Foreign Secretary was alerted on Friday. Therefore again pointing towhat is on the balance of probabilities, there was a conversation on the Fridayand there was some talk of embassy reaction. The consequence of this was thatPincher had not been impressed by Lohan&apos;s Friday explanations after he hadcleared the story for &apos; Ds&apos; on Thursday and so suspected there was an officialmotive behind the change of attitude because he had been given an explanationthat did not seem to him to be a sensible one.Chairman: It is common ground, is it not, that on Friday Colonel Lohanwho does not himself think he spoke to Pincher on Friday, when Pincher&apos;srecollection was there was no reference to &apos; D &apos; notices I must not say common ground because Colonel Lohan does not think he spoke to him then.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Still no mention of &apos; D &apos; notices, Thursday and Friday.Then there was a second conversation, still no mention of &apos; D&apos; notices.   I havenot put that in.    Then we come to the important lunch which lasted from1 o&apos;clock until 3 o&apos;clock on Monday, 20th February.  It is common ground that colonel Lohan produced the &apos; Ds&apos;, the &apos; Ds&apos; were laid aside and that colonel lohan tried to persuade Pincher to advise the editor not to publish.  It is common ground Pincher was vehement on the public interest issue and infringement of individual and commercial privilege and liberty.  It is common ground there wasno mention of any specific operations being in hand, and Pincher promised to pass on to the editor Colonel Lohan&apos;s request.   On parting I think it is fair to say, my lord, that Lohan had not won his battle in persuading Pincher itshould not be published.   All I am going to deal with are those matters ofcommon ground in those two hours.  Then we go on to see if we can get anyhelp on what happened thereafter.   It is common ground that Colonel Lohangoes to the Daily Mail and there lays aside the &apos; Ds &apos;. The Mail understands fromLohan that a specific operation was going on.   They definitely did understandthat. That was Matthewman&apos;s and Macpherson&apos;s evidence reported to Brittenden.No special operation, it was agreed by Lohan, was spoken of to Chapman Pincher.To see what probably actually happened at the lunch it is important to see that colonel Lohan took his &apos; Ds &apos; to the Daily Mail, but did he use them?  No, he didnot use them because he put them aside at the Daily Mail, so the attitude ofthe Daily Mail was not governed by the &apos; Ds&apos; but was governed by the personalrequest, namely the exercise of his discretion, and the editor did exercise his discretion because he said in his view this was his personal view that a request from Colonel Lohan was tantamount to the application of &apos; Ds&apos;,although the &apos; Ds&apos; had been specifically laid aside.   If he says, why did Lohanbring the &apos; Ds&apos; to lunch if he was not going to apply them, you may say, whydid he take them to the Mail if he was not going to apply them, because theMail evidence is clear, he did not apply them, he relied upon his personal request to the editor.Chairman: I am not sure. He went straight to the Mail from the luncheonplace, did he not? So if he had brought the &apos; D &apos; notices to the lunch he reallyhad to have them with him when he went to the Mail.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes, my Lord, but the issue, as I understand it, that has got to be resolved is, did he during the course of that lunch apply the &apos; Ds&apos;;in other words, do these &apos; Ds&apos; apply? It has been suggested because he hadthem with him that shows he did apply them. To test that we will look and see what he did at the Mail. Because he had them with him at the Mail did heapply them in the Mail? No, he did not. In other words, though he had themwith him at the Mail he did not apply them but relied on his personal request.How can it necessarily be said that because he took them to the lunch withPincher he must have applied them at that lunch? In other words you haveto test what he was using the &apos; Ds &apos; for at the lunch by what he used them for at the Mail, where we have outside evidence, and it is quite clear that he laysthem aside with the Mail.   If he is right in what he has been saying, why did
he not say to the Daily Mail editor, &quot; Look at 1956, 1956 applies, clearly 1956applies. I am telling you, Mr. Matthewman, you must tell Mr. Brittenden thatI am saying the 1956 &apos; D &apos; applies&quot;. He did not do that because, I would suggest, he really knew himself in his heart of hearts at this stage that &apos; Ds&apos;did not really apply. That is why he was laying them aside. He would much prefer to have been able to say, &quot;&apos; D &apos; does apply, therefore do not use it &quot;,but he was putting them aside and he put them aside with the Mail equallyas he put them aside with Pincher, and he did this because he hoped the papers would react to his personal request. The Mail did, the Expresseventually did not. Then the typing looks a bit strange here, but it is common ground that after lunch while Colonel Lohan is at the Mail Pincher goes back and writes the story. He first discusses the story with the editor, then writesthe story. This is the first time the editor has been alerted to this story; thatis about 5.45 p.m. It is common ground that at about 6.30 Pincher telephonesLohan, and then it is Lohan&apos;s evidence; Lohan leaves wherever he is at about.30 to get the 7.49 train which arrives at Charing, Kent, at 9.11 p.m. chapman pincher&apos;s version of the 6.30 conversation was, &quot; They are going to print; i cannot tell you if it will be definite today, but I will let you know by 8.15 &quot;.Now, my Lord, there is a conflict which may have been unnecessary but I suppose it has to be dealt with, because Colonel Lohan claims there were about three or four conversations and Pincher sent that evening up to him for the&apos; Ds&apos;; and Pincher says there was just one conversation about him not being available between 8.15 and when he would be home at 9.30. On that pointyou have indicated you are not interested, but it might be that hereafter wheniwe are not here it might arise again, so I think I will deal with it. It is common ground the receipts do show some apparent date alterations. Pincherdenies he sent for them on the 20th; he says he sent for them on the 21stafter the House of Commons statement, because this is the time he says he wanted them. The Express messenger book clearly shows a messenger went to colonel Lohan on the 21st and on the 22nd, and there was no messenger on the20th. My Munday has told you that after the House of Commons statement,a few days after Wednesday, Colonel Lohan spoke to him, spoke to the actualman in charge of the messengers, not very high in the hierarchy ; he actuallydid speak to the chief of the messenger boys to inquire the names of themessengers; and Colonel Lohan&apos;s secretary inquired of the Express when amessenger had been sent. I put those as facts before you ; I do not want tomake any more comment, but misunderstandings can of course arise, but thiswas not cross-examined to because in fact it was not known there was this dispute. But on that evidence, applying again not only the balance of probabili-ties but really proof, I suggest it must be on the evidence incorrect that the &apos; Ds &apos;were sent for by the Express on the evening of Monday the 20th. Of course itmight be considered to be relevant, what were they doing sending for &apos; Ds&apos; onthe very night of writing the story ; in fact they never did ; they sent for them the day after.There was no contact with the Express by Colonel Lohan after Pincherspoke at about 6.30 until 9.38 p.m. when Colonel Lohan spoke to Mr. Johnson.An arrangement had been made, according to Pincher, that he would telephoneColonel Lohan as soon as Lohan got to his house at Charing, and this he did,and Lohan of his own volition went out of contact during this period of6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m., whatever his reasons may be; he may have thought his request had been rejected, he had done all he could do. Again I suggestperhaps at this time in Colonel Lohan&apos;s mind was the thought, &quot; There is nothingI can do because &apos; Ds&apos; do not really apply. All there is for me to do is tomake my request&quot;. It was only thereafter when the pressure came upon him that he persuaded himself that &apos; Ds&apos; do apply, but at the time, if you look atthe facts and the times, it looks as if he is making his personal request all thathe can rely on with the Express and, that having failed, there is nothing morehe can do.On all those matters with regard to Mr. Chapman Pincher he can only besaid to have been in breach of faith or to have broken any form of procedureor agreement if it is said that he was told that &apos; Ds&apos; applied and that he
wrongly conveyed to the editor that &apos; Ds&apos; did not apply. I can only sayyou have heard Mr. Pincher, you know of him and, without my needing to stress it, why should he have done such a thing? It is unthinkable. Secondlyall the story, and this is most important, is much more consistent with the layingaside of &apos; Ds&apos; which was done at the Daily Mail and which was done to chapman pincher, and he correctly passed on to the editor that &apos; Ds&apos; did not apply butLohan urges not to publish.Chairman: I think on this we want to know exactly how you put Mr.Pincher&apos;s assurance to the editor, that in effect he cleared the &apos; D&apos; notice question with Colonel Lohan, because he does seem to have said categoricallyto the editor that is the word used &quot; Lohan agrees &quot;, or &quot; I have clearedthis with Lohan&quot;, or something like that. Could that be a really adequatereflection of what had passed from beginning to end of the luncheon meeting? Ithink on the way the Express has put their attitude in general and their positionit was very important to the editor he was not given the impression that there was any argument open about it.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Certainly, my Lord. May I just take again the position?Look at Mr. Matthewman and Mr. Brittenden. What did Mr. Matthewmanreport to Mr. Brittenden on the Mail? He reported that Colonel Lohan asked that there should not be published this story, but that these were laid aside. i will get the exact words. It is on page 26 of Mr. Matthewman&apos;s evidence, myLord.   Mr. Hirst is asking him:  &quot; Q. Having finished, as it were, with Colonel Lohan, did you go straightto the editor to see him? A. I did.Q. Did you report to him in general terms the gist of what Colonel Lohanhad told you? A. Yes, I certainly did.Q. Did the editor then ask you a question, and if so what was it? A. Yes. The editor asked me whether Colonel Lohan had referred to a specific operation going on at that time, and naturally I said Macphersonhad asked that question, and I told him the answer which I have already given to the committee.Q. Did you and the editor then discuss the principle involved in thiskind of approach by Colonel Lohan, and if so in what terms? A. we did discuss it. There was some conversation between us on the questionof whether this approach had the equivalent weight of a &apos; D&apos; notice, andin the course of that conversation I think we both agreed that in such asystem as we have of a voluntary system of trust and confidence we couldneither of us I had better not speak for the editor but I said I could see no difference in principle between a request put in this manner by thesecretary of the &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee and a &apos; D&apos; notice itself ; it did not seem to me to alter the principle of the thing at all.&quot;What quite clearly arises from that is that Mr. Matthewman was not saying toMr. Brittenden &quot; Lohan has applied the &apos; D&apos; notice. What he is saying is,&quot; Lohan is requesting not to publish ; &apos; Ds &apos; have been laid aside &quot;.Chairman: The actual passage I think is on page 25 of Mr. Matthewman&apos;sevidence:  &quot; Q. Was anything said or done about &apos; D &apos; notices? A. Yes. colonel lohan at a stage in the conversation did say &apos; There are as a matter of facta couple of &apos; D &apos; notices&apos; which he half drew out of his pocket &apos; whichcould be said to affect this particular story&apos;. But he put the &apos; D&apos; noticesback and said &apos; However, this conversation is not on the basis of &apos; D &apos; notices ;this is on the basis that I am making an approach to you in this manner&apos;. Asfar as I can recollect there was no further reference to &apos; D &apos; notices at allin that conversation.&quot;Sir Peter Rawlinson: Then on page 29 you asked, your fourth question:  &quot; Q. Then when Colonel Lohan came to see you on the afternoon ofMonday, the 20th, he apparently had two &apos; D &apos; notices with him, and made reference to them?-A. That is right, my lord.
Q. Did it get as close, between you and him, as Colonel Lohan actuallyreading any bit of them out to you or referring you to them? A. No, mylord, not at all, they were not even opened.Q. So it really was not present to your mind one way or the other asto what particular wording was used in those &apos; D &apos; notices which he saidhad reference?-A. No, my lord, in fact the reverse, because he said hewas not making a point of those &apos; D &apos; notices.&quot;Chairman: I follow that; I will mark that.  Now you go back again to Mr.Chapman Pincher.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Bearing that in mind, the evidence of Colonel Lohan&apos;attitude a few minutes later, then we come to see what was his probable attitudetowards Chapman Pincher, and of course Chapman Pxncher&apos;s version of it isidentical with that of Matthewman, except that Pincher is more forthright withhis friend and there is no trying it on with him and he is very vehement about it,and he says the &apos; D &apos; notices go back into Lohan&apos;s pocket and the argument turnsabout generally on the matter of security, the pattern, with Chapman Pinchergetting vehement about interference on this scale with privacy and liberty.Chairman: Would even that amount justify him saying to his editor, whowas not in touch with Colonel Lohan, &quot; They are cleared with Lohan &quot;, becausethat is a positive statement, not saying &quot; Lohan is not relying on them &quot;?Sir Peter Rawlinson: They are either applied by Lohan or not. If they arenot, then the story is cleared. It must be one or the other; you cannot halfapply them. He does not apply them, he lays them aside. You either apply a&apos; D &apos; notice or you do not. If it is not applied, then it is clear. So his position was &quot;Do &apos; D &apos; notices apply &quot;, &quot; No, they do not&quot; they are clear. That is what he said and that is what he did. And, as I have said, it is illustrative the Mailindicates what it was. And you have other evidence to show the attitude Lohanwas adopting. Matthewman does not say &apos; D&apos; notices were applied: he says&apos; D &apos; notices were not applied. And if &apos; D &apos; notices were not applied the storywas clear. Otherwise, my lord, the situation is this: half a &apos; D &apos; notice on this,a bit of a &apos; D &apos; notice on this. What does this make of the procedure? Pincher&apos;sduty was to do what Lohan asked him to do, and Lohan asked him to conveya personal request not to publish. And it was therefore on the basis outsidethe application of Ds, solely on personal request.My lord, again if this had got to be examined judicially it would have to beon the basis of an accusation or a finding of guilt or misbehaviour or inaccuracy.In a matter such as this it is as important to journalists as it is to anybody else.It is surely fair to him to be able to look at the outside evidence and see if it morecorroborates Lohan or him, because the only bits you have are corroboration andfact of Chapman Pincher. Should he therefore have indicated to the editorthat there was some possible discussion about &apos; D &apos; notices? My lord, againI pose a rhetorical question: what good would that have done? Either they apply or they do not. Lohan was clearly not applying them to the Mail, notapplying them to Chapman Pincher. Therefore the report which he made tothe editor was a perfectly fair report, made on his experiences of &apos; D &apos; notices.He accepted what all the other editors, looking at it completely fresh, have said without any good reason they have got an alliance Telegraph, Mirror, New,Statesman, The Times, Daily Express, all together, and surely this does indicatethat in their view &apos; Ds&apos; did not apply, and this is exactly what Chapman Pincherwas saying to his editor. And it would be very hard and very wrong to say&quot; Well, you discussed for a bit of the time about &apos; Ds&apos;; you ought to have putthat in &quot;, because the responsibility is on Lohan. Lohan could have gone tothe editor. Instead he got the 7.49 train home and did not get home until 9.11.Lohan knew at 6.30 the decision had been taken to print. Why did he not go round to the Daily Express and see the editor himself, because he knew.Chairman: He knew at 6.30?Sir Peter Rawlinson: He knew they had decided to print but not definitelywhether it was going to be that night, but he would be told at 8.15 ; the decisionhad been taken to publish but it was not certain whether it would be that night,in case some major story came in.
Chairman: I did not get quite that impression. It is in my mind that chapman pincher said at 6.30 he could not give an answer to Lohan and it was not until he rang up after Lohan had got home that he said &quot; You have lost&quot;.Sir Peter Rawlinson: The position was he had written the story, the editorhad decided to print. It is true there was no decision that they would be printingthat night, but the request had been rejected. The reference is page 12 of Day 3,15th March, second question:&quot; Q. After this, about 6.30, did you have a conversation with colonel lohan? A. Yes, I telephoned him at his office to tell him I had writtenthe story and I had taken it in to the editor and I had told the editor ofhis request, including the bit about all powers of persuasion. And I told him if we did decide to print the story that night I would inform him. Thereis a reason which I should explain to the committee as to why I just couldnot say to Colonel Lohan the moment I thought the editor was going to print it &quot; Look, I think he is going to print&quot;, because I knew in spite ofwhat he said about the Daily Mail being in the bag, that he would be dutybound to ring the Daily Mail and say &quot; The Express is going to print&quot;.It would not be possible for me to be certain that night until 8.15 that wewere going to print that night. The editor may have decided to print butnot that night, if something big had come in. But if Colonel Lohan rangthe Mall and said we were going to print, the Mail could have come outwith the story. So I had to be certain before I rang Colonel Lohan, who  knew would ring the Mail and tell them that we were printing that night.So I told him &quot; I cannot be sure we are printing tonight until 8.15 &quot;.Chairman: I would not read that as saying there was a firm determination to publish this story but not necessarily on Tuesday morning ; I would have thoughtit left it open.Sir Peter Rawlinson: We will turn up his statement, page 12. Yes, I think have put it too high:&quot; At about that time I telephoned Colonel Lohan to tell him that I had written the story and had told the editor of his request. I promised that ifthe paper decided to print the story that night I would inform him as soonas possible, but that I would not know the final decision much before 8.15p.m.&quot;What I took from that was that the request had gone, he had written the story,he would not know if they were to print that night until 8.15. At 8.15 colonel lohan is en route to Charing in Kent and does not get there until 9.30. Mypoint remains the same, that Colonel Lohan should have gone to the editor,should have gone even if there was doubt if it would be printed that night. Hecould have gone to the editor at the Express or sought him out wherever he was.And Chapman Pincher&apos;s attitude anyhow, my lord, was &quot;&apos; Ds&apos; do not apply; ithas been tried on but they do not apply, and I am entitled to say to the editor&apos; They do not apply &apos; &quot;.  And this is what he did tell the editor.  So much for that.Now I will turn briefly to Mr. Marks. It is said on page 10 that the editorfirst heard anything about the story at 5.45 on Monday the 20th ; that the editorwas assured by Pincher &apos; Ds&apos; did not apply; that the editor checked that theOfficial Secrets Act did not apply; that he received Lohan&apos;s personal requestnot to publish ; that he assessed not only Lohan&apos;s request but also political interest in a story of a general interception of communications on such a widescale; and that between 6.30 and 7.10, having received no letter or furtherword for Colonel Lohan the editor decided in exercise of discretion that since he was assured &apos; Ds &apos; did not apply he would publish.Therefore at that time when he said he made his decision he had received no warning not to print. He had received a request not to print. But before publication he received no warning that the story was in breach of &apos; D&apos; notice.I think that seems to be categorical, unless you want me to deal with it in detail.But if you accept that, the position is there was no warning, no warning in those terms was given or could have been given at any earlier time, because &apos; Ds&apos;were not applied.
He then goes to the Garrick Club dinner for Sir Trevor Evans. And at 10.15he gets a message from Sir Max. And we see from the times that by thenGlasgow must have gone to press by half an hour and would be certainly on the streets and sold round the hotels in Glasgow.He then received a message and immediately speaks to Glasgow and rings upMcColl. And he has told you why he rang McColl because Sir Max saidGlasgow. And why did Sir Max say Glasgow? because the Foreign secretary said Glasgow. All this fits in.He then speaks to Johnson, and again it is of significance, when Johnsontells the editor of his conversation and produces the memorandum, when therehad been no mention of &apos; Ds&apos;. The first thing Colonel Lohan would saywould be &quot; I understand you are publishing the story. I must tell you categoricallythere is a &apos; D&apos; notice applied &quot;, but he did not, because he could not.Then the editor returns to the office and reads Johnson&apos;s memorandum. Thatagain is only a matter of the request from Colonel Lohan. And by the time he is back and reading the memorandum all three centres have gone.He then speaks to Greig to tell him cable vetting had been cleared for &apos; Ds&apos;,as he had been informed. And he speaks to Lohan, who says for the first time that the story was under &apos; D &apos; notice. He has not said this to Matthewman, not toMacpherson, not to Chapman Pincher, not to Johnson to none of those peopledid he say it.  But he says it to the editor this time.By this time the balloon has gone up, of which you will be more awarebecause of this procedure whereby persons who in fact are accused, perhaps not formally, do not know all the story. But the balloon had by that time gone up. And Lohan for the first time mentions the &apos; D&apos; notice and that he had told Pincher about the &apos; D&apos; notice. All I can say again is Pincher denies that,and other evidence indicates that he had not.About 11.40 Greig gets on the telephone and says the story is under &apos; D &apos; notice,he has been alerted about that particular one.And at 12.45 which can be checked, because it is a call outside London the editor informs Lohan that he is stopping the story. He assumes otherswill not print it. But he is told The Times and Mail are publishing, so hedecides again that &apos; Ds &apos; have not been invoked. The summary of his positionis set out there. He did not receive a warning before publication, which isimportant to bear in mind, because Sir Max&apos;s message comes after publication.And he himself has discretion, because he did not think a request from Lohanvia Pincher had the equivalent force of a &apos; D &apos; notice. We have heard of nowarnings being given, except the Foreign Secretary, and that was given to SirMax. If his interpretation of the procedure was correct,,,which is supported byhis fellows, then certainly he did nothing wrong.Then we come finally to Sir Max. He receives a telephone call at 10.10.Again I would ask that the demeanour of witnesses should be looked at. Youheard Sir Max give his evidence. I suggest to you that it is correct. he received the telephone call at 10.10 and this is quite significant, because it isquite obvious a misunderstanding could have arisen. He was called from theGarrick Club. The Foreign Secretary asked for Sir Max and thought he was atthe Express. But the Express put him through to the Garrick Club. TheForeign Secretary does not appreciate that Sir Max is in fact at the GarrickClub. And this business about the editor being beside him is a misunderstand-ing. But it indicates how people can be misled. And the Foreign Secretarymay indeed have been misled and misunderstood that. But quite clearly whatSir Max says that the Foreign Secretary said was they were running a story undera &apos; D&apos; notice in Glasgow. This is the Glasgow point. We are not able tocall Mr. Eban from Japan. But immediately after Sir Max telephones Glasgowto check. Immediately after Sir Max said something to that person and a few minutes later he says something to Derek Marks, a few minutes later he saysGlasgow. Can I remind you Glasgow is where the paper was being sold at thattime and Glasgow is what was said by the Foreign Secretary according to the
recollection of Sir Max. The editor immediately telephoned to Glasgow toMcColl because he thinks &quot; &apos; D &apos; notices&quot; and his immediate reaction to thatwas Polaris or something of that kind. He gets through in a matter of secondsand then gets back to the London office.The Foreign Secretary made a point of saying he believed that Sir Max knew what that story was. Sir Max tells us categorically he did not. That is a beliefas opposed to an assertion by the witness. And I would ask you to accept that what is based upon belief should not be balanced against what is said to be thecase. And the editor did not speak to Sir Max before the telephone call andhad no idea what the story was. And what was more sensible than to say &quot;//we are running a story under &apos; D &apos; we will take it out&quot;? The emphasis I putis &quot; if&quot;. But the conversation probably was &quot; Yes, if we are running a storyunder &apos; D &apos; we will take it out&quot;, without emphasis on the &quot; if &quot;. But the positionis he would think it highly improbable that purely at the request of the foreign secretary the proprietor would say he would immediately take it out withoutseeing if it was under &apos; D&apos; notice. Ministers are mortal and can make mistakes,and clearly the proprietor would have wanted to see if there had been a mistake. So what is more likely on probabilities is that Sir Max&apos;s version is correct. He did not know what the story was, and if he did not know it isobvious he would have said &quot; If it is under &apos; D&apos; we will take it out&quot;.Chairman: What is your reference to the Foreign Secretary believes? he did at one stage in his evidence use the &quot; if &quot; himself.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes, but he says &quot; if&quot; was not stressed. That I can see may well be. A complete misunderstanding can arise over this. He has got information which you have got and which we have not got of what washappening, and he did not want to speak on the telephone, and one can see what could have happened in that conversation.And then &quot; possibility proprietor necessarily knew of story unlikely &quot;. I have set out on page 13 the corroboration of Sir Max&apos;s version. And if that is sothere has most certainly not been a breach of faith by Sir Max in any shape orform. He did as he promised, which was that the story would be taken out if itwas under &apos; D &apos; notice.I am very desirous obviously, in my position as counsel for Sir Max, Mr.Marks and Mr. Pincher, to deal with any matters which may be in the mind of the committee, because although the committee has got a lot of work to do this is to all three of very considerable importance. And because the committeehas had to cross-examine as well as judge, and combine the role of the two,I am entitled to ask you if on their individual points I can help the committee inthis respect, in regard to the position of the three individuals, as opposed to thesystem, because this is an examination to see if there is any bad faith whichmust be considered judicially, and the onus is on those who have asserted it toshow that there was that. But I suggest there is no evidence of bad faith by any single person. At the worst there is a misunderstanding and it was not a misunderstanding brought about by Sir Max or the editor or Mr. Pincher.Therefore I ask that there should be findings of this committee. And I have set them out in paragraph 4, as you see, my lord.Chairman: Yes.Sir Peter Rawlinson: That there was no breach of any &apos; D&apos; notice ; Certainlyno clear breach of two &apos; D &apos; notices ; That there was no breach of the &apos; D &apos;notice procedure or convention; That there were no warnings (I want toemphasise &quot; warmings&quot;) whatever before publication; That where a storycontains public interest elements beyond solely security, and where it is believedno &apos; D&apos; notices apply, an editor may exercise his discretion and cannot be criticised for exercising it in a way which officialdom dislikes.Chairman: Warnings would include no undertaking to take the story outwhich was broken?
Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes, certainly.Chairman: The Foreign Secretary&apos;s evidence on one point of view might read&quot; His undertaking that it would come out as long as they were given enlargement of the story the next day &quot;.Sir Peter Rawlinson: Yes, that could be one interpretation of what he said.He then did not agree with me in cross-examination about the &quot; if &quot; if it wasunder &apos; D&apos; notice it would be taken out. I think the Foreign Secretary got theimpression that it was under &apos; D &apos; notice ; so when he heard Sir Max say &quot; If itis under &apos; D &apos; notice, I will take it out &quot; that was an end of the matter. The wholething goes back to whether it was under &apos; D &apos; notice; this is where the misunder-standing arises. And if it was not under &apos; D &apos; notice, then the Foreign secretary was under a misapprehension and had been misadvised in that way ; and there forfeit follows.Chairman: This is a very useful document; we are all grateful to you for putting it in this form.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: I am puzzled by this word &quot;military&quot; in paragraph 131on page 36 of the 1962 report. Why was it put in quotes?Chairman: I think I can answer that.Sir Peter Rawlinson: You know better than I.Chairman: I think it is due to the fact that nobody would admit on the Pressside that &apos; D &apos; notices related on some occasions to matters wider than &quot; military &quot;defence as that phrase is normally understood; on the other hand, this has beenthe practice over the years.Sir Peter Rawlinson: If you look at page 39, paragraph 143 (b), it says:&quot; The agreement on the Press side to receive and respect &apos; D&apos; notices iscontingent upon the subject matter being confined to &apos; naval, military andair matters the publication of which would be prejudicial to the national interest&apos;. As we have said, this formula is not strictly insisted upon: but any attempt to go outside it is liable to be regarded with suspicion and should only be resorted to, therefore, on special occasions when the subject is oneof grave and obvious importance. There is always likely to be resentmentif a Notice is thought to have been dictated by &apos; political&apos; considerations, or if it is thought that the official side is trying unreasonably to suppress herematter which is already public knowledge abroad &quot;.I should have thought it was a paraphrase of the idea of naval, military and airmatters which has got to be something affecting the State, which an enemy orpotential enemy might do to the State. This would be taking it at its extreme ofcourse. &quot;Military&quot; clearly would mean something to do with physical defence,real reality of defence.There was the question of the non-nuclear reactors which was held out. Thatwas of course not a military matter. But it was held out because representations were made and requests were acceded to.Chairman: The whole question of course is counter intelligence and espionage.Sir Peter Rawlinson: This is a story which clearly has got elements within it which do not go beyond strictly the military, because of the well-documentedreaction of people to the interception by the Customs and Excise, the InlandRevenue, of commercial firms, of private communications. That obviously hasto be done on occasion, but when it is done it has to be done, so the BirkettCommittee says, selectively.That is all I want to put, my lord, save, as I have said, that in this kind ofprocedure, where I know not what you have got, and where you have to actas prosecutor as well as the judge, I would ask, if I may, that if there are any matters which you think arise and which affect any of the three persons for whom I appear, I would ask that we should either be called back or that it shouldbe put before us now to deal with it; otherwise I have concluded my submission.Chairman: Thank you very much. I am obliged to you.
Witnesses : Sir James Dunnett, Mr. J. M. Wilson, Mr. J. A. DrewChairman: We have a memorandum, Sir James, not explicity described ascoming from you but from the Government side, about the Press and Broad-casting Committee (Document No. 15). You and your colleagues will be speaking to the theme of that document? A. Sir James Dunnett: Yes, certainly.Q. You have raised a covering point, I think, in a letter to the secretary,which we had better deal with right away. A. That is the particular businessof the Spectator articles?Q. Yes. A. I think I ought to report to you that before coming here I didhave a meeting of the Services Press and Broadcasting Committee, in case therewere any points which the Press members wanted to raise about the proceduregenerally, and at the end of that meeting a number of the members on the Pressside pressed me very hard about what was being done about the Spectatorarticles, and made it very clear that they as Press men took a very serious viewof this ; they thought it quite wrong for the Spectator to publish the substance of&apos; D &apos; notices, and they regarded the second article, indeed the first one, as a quiteunjustified attack on the secretary, and they pressed me very hard as to whetherthe committee as a whole ought to refer it to the Press Council. They were notunanimous on that, but did feel very strongly that the Spectator should not getaway with it. I told them you might be dealing with that and we had betterleave it for the time being, but I thought I ought to report that they did feelvery strongly that the Spectator articles should not just pass with no action beingtaken on them.Q. I do not know what my colleagues think about it, because we have not had time to discuss this. Of course, we are not a disciplinary committee in any sense, nor I gather is the Press and Broadcasting Committee? A. Certainly not.Q. The only disciplinary organisation in the whole press set-up could be saidto be the Press Council? A. Yes.Q. It has I imagine never had a case referred to it from your committee hasit? A. I do not think that has ever happened, no.Q. Of course, this Spectator publication occurred after the Daily Expressarticle?- A. Certainly.Q. And is really a Press pendant to it? A. Certainly.Q. It is not in any clear sense in our terms of reference. The only point is whether, when we come to consider the second part of our inquiry to consider what improvements if any are required in the system for the future we oughtto investigate this claim by the Spectator that the &apos; D &apos; notices are not confidential,because I think that is the line it took, that there is no harm in publishing the contents of a &apos; D &apos; notice? A. My committee as a whole, and certainly the official side, certainly disagree with that line, and the press members themselves made it quite clear that in their opinion these &apos; D&apos; notices must be regarded, as theyalways have been by the press, as confidential and not for publication.Q. They are marked in that form, are they not? A. Yes.Q. And always have been?-A. Yes.Q. We in a sense do not know what the understanding is, but your Pressmembers are clear that every editor for whom they speak would regard this assomething which he had to keep locked up in his desk, and that he should neveractually make it part of his printed material? -A. Absolutely.Q. Then there is also a distinction drawn by the Spectator, I think, between &apos; D &apos;notices of one kind and &apos; D&apos; notices of another kind? A. We would not admitany such distinction, they are all private and confidential documents.Q. The third point I understand is that they maintain they have never beenunder the system, that they have never received confidential communications.That is a question of fact, which Colonel Lohan with his records could prove? A. I can say something about that. The fact is that the words which they usedin their second article were very carefully drafted, they said &quot; the presenteditor and none of the present staff&quot;, that in fact no &apos;D&apos; notice has been
59 *\hi *)issued since Mr. Lawson took over. The Colonel has in his possession a receiptpfrom Mr. Iain Macleod, shortly before he gave up, when Colonel Lohan had&quot;sent round a note to all editors, saying: &quot;Will you confirm you have got these&apos;D&apos; notices?&quot;, and Mr. Iain Macleod acknowledged receipt of that and also referred to the fact that Mr. Lawson would be taking over from him in a fewweeks time, so we regard that as evidence, which is borne out I think by colonel lohan&apos;s records, that certainly the Spectator had received the &apos; D &apos; notices. (Mr.Wilson): I think the letter Colonel Lohan was referring to was a letter which hewas sending round to the alleged recipients of &apos; D &apos; notices, to check that the address and person to whom they should be sent were correct. It was headed&quot; Questionnaire about &apos; D&apos; notices&quot;, and therefore was specifically related to&apos; D &apos; notices, and I understand it was not an attempt to check up that theSpectator had received all previous issues of &apos; D &apos; notices, but to the extent thatMr. Macleod acknowledged that this was the right address to which &apos; D&apos;notices should be sent, but that in future Mr. Lawson would be taking over from him, it implied that he accepted that the Spectator was on the &apos; D &apos; noticecirculation list.Q. Are comparable weeklies  recipients, that is,  the New Statesman, theEconomist, and so on? A. (Mr. Drew): Yes.Q. It would be surprising if the Spectator was not on the list. A. (Sir JamesDitnnett): Very surprising.Mr. Shinwell: I should have thought we were justified in asking the editor ofthe Spectator a few questions, particularly as they condemn the existing procedure.Why should we not enquire from him whether he has got any views on an improved procedure on a matter of this sort, and what was the motive in publishing the article they did. I think I would not take it too far, but I certainly think they came into the picture of their own volition, and there is noreason why the editor should not explain his purpose, and be asked in particularwhether he has got any constructive suggestion to make. After all, we are an inquiry to consider that.Chairman: Yes, I see some force in that. That would only mean that you havegiven us the background of your understanding of the Spectators position inthe system, and as they have said they are quite ready to come and offer theirexplanation we may decide to invite them. You cannot carry it further at themoment? A. We cannot cany it further, no.Q. Then perhaps we can now come to your memorandum, but could we just-be clear first as to whether we should regard the memorandum as coming fromthe committee as a whole or coming from the Government side? A. It comes fromthe Government side, and in so far as the committee&apos;s views are concerned I canexpress those orally. This is not a document from the, committee as a whole.I think the first part of the paper deals with the question of whether there is really any alternative to something like the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure as it is at themoment, and concludes that there is not.

K 9 0Jwuissued since Mr. Lawson took over. The Colonel has in his possession a receiptprom Mr. Iain Macleod, shortly before he gave up, when Colonel Lohan hadB^sent round a note to all editors, saying: &quot;Will you confirm you have got these&apos;D&apos; notices? &quot;, and Mr. Iain Macleod acknowledged receipt of that and also referred to the fact that Mr. Lawson would be taking over from him in a fewweeks time, so we regard that as evidence, which is borne out I think by colonel lohan&apos;s records, that certainly the Spectator had received the &apos; D &apos; notices.-(Mr.Wilson): I think the letter Colonel Lohan was referring to was a letter which hewas sending round to the alleged recipients of &apos; D &apos; notices, to check that the address and person to whom they should be sent were correct. It was headed&quot; Questionnaire about &apos; D &apos; notices&quot;, and therefore was specifically related to&apos; D &apos; notices, and I understand it was not an attempt to check up that theSpectator had received all previous issues of &apos; D&apos; notices, but to the extent thatMr. Macleod acknowledged that this was the right address to which &apos; D&apos;notices should be sent, but that in future Mr. Lawson would be taking over from him, it implied that he accepted that the Spectator was on the &apos; D &apos; noticecirculation list.Q. Are comparable weeklies recipients, that is, the New Statesman, theEconomist, and so on? A. (Mr. Drew): Yes.Q. It would be surprising if the Spectator was not on the list. A. (Sir JamesDunnett): Very surprising.Mr. Shinwell: I should have thought we were justified in asking the editor ofthe Spectator a few questions, particularly as they condemn the existing procedure.Why should we not enquire from him whether he has got any views on an improved procedure on a matter of this sort, and what was the motive in publishing the article they did. I think I would not take it too far, but I certainly think they came into the picture of their own volition, and there is noreason why the editor should not explain his purpose, and be asked in particularwhether he has got any constructive suggestion to make. After all, we are an inquiry to consider that.Chairman: Yes, I see some force in that. That would only mean that you havegiven us the background of your understanding of the Spectators position inthe system, and as they have said they are quite ready to come and offer theirexplanation we may decide to invite them. You cannot carry it further at themoment? A. We cannot carry it further, no.Q. Then perhaps we can now come to your memorandum, but could we justbe clear first as to whether we should regard the memorandum as coming fromthe committee as a whole or coming from the Government side? A. It comes fromthe Government side, and in so far as the committee&apos;s views are concerned I canexpress those orally. This is not a document from the, committee as a whole.I think the first part of the paper deals with the question of whether there is really any alternative to something like the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure as it is at themoment, and concludes that there is not. If one accepts that, then I think oneconsiders how one can take the system broadly as it is and modify it in detail to make it work better than it has worked so far. If one accepts that, one thencomes to certain specific proposals, and perhaps I can touch briefly on them.Q. I have a question or two as we go along.   In paragraph 4 on page 2 it isstated:&quot; On the positive side the &apos; D &apos; notice system undoubtedly serves its purposewell on many more occasions than it is infringed &quot;.Then you have three headings of information:Q. It has not been publicised, no, but would you attribute that to the positiveworking of &apos; D &apos; notices?- A. I would say that, as this practice has been going on for forty years, I would answer in the affirmative, yes.Q. Then on page 3 you consider whether there is any alternative to the presentsystem which is feasible, and in effect- and I am not criticising this you think there is no feasible alternative system? A. That is right.
Q. Then you say:&quot; If the present infringement can be cleared up and put aside and a basis!of confidence and mutual co-operation re-established between the official and press sides, there is no reason why the system should not continuebroadly as it is &quot;.Then come the questions of what I will call minor amendments, because they donot affect the main conception under which it works, and then you go back tothe special case of the Spectator, and then, on page 5, &quot;The role of thesecretary &quot;. A. I did just want to say a few words about that. As the papersays, we regard this as being absolutely crucial. He is a servant of the com-mittee, and obviously he must be somebody who enjoys the full confidence ofboth sides. There is one point to which I would like to refer briefly in thisconnection: I think because of the fact that this post was held for so long by admiral Thomson, whose work was known to everybody, and who had beenin censorship during the war, and that certain things went on for a very longtime without being looked at, and for example at the present time and as you know I have only taken over the chairmanship fairly recently it has not beenheld that the secretary of the committee needs to be fully P.V&apos;d., I think this case emphasises something that I have felt for some time, that if people are going to talk very frankly to the secretary about some pretty secret things, it isfor consideration whether it would not help the thing if he was known by all thepeople concerned to be fully P.V&apos;d.Q. Are there any objections to that? Let me ask you first of all: have youany reason to suppose that the fact that the meeting at the Foreign Office, onthe Friday before the publication, included a number of interested agencies but did not include Colonel Lohan, who was to do the work, was due to the factthat he was known not to have been fully P.V&apos;d? A. No, I would not go as fat-as that. ... So I would not like to go as far as saying that he was kept out ofthat meeting because it was known that he had not been fully cleared P.V.-wise.I am making the more general point that I think it would probably help generalconfidence and freedom of discussion between Government departments and thesecretary of the committee if it was known that he was fully P.V&apos;d.Q. If you do not see any argument against it, I should have thought it mightwell help. A. I see no argument against it. (Mr. Drew): None whatever. (Sir James Dunnett): The secretary is certainly the key figure in the whole thing,and I think that is what we are trying to say here.Q. You then have a point in paragraph 10, that it might improve his position if he were made a full member of the committee. My own mind is doubtful about that. A. I am bound to say, so is mine. This is a suggestion which has beenmade in the past by Colonel Lohan, and I think it was referred to in the 1962report about &apos; D&apos; notices. I personally do have reservations about this particularone, I think he is better off and is more trusted by both sides if he is not amember of the committee, and I do not really think&quot; it would strengthen hisposition if he was on the committee.Q. To some extent it might weaken it, might it not, because if he speaks as secretary he speaks for everybody, as long as he carries out the right procedure? A. Certainly, that is my own view.Q. Your next heading is &quot; Channel of advice to the secretary &quot;. I think, ifI may say so, this is an ideal scheme, but I wonder whether it is practical in the setting of press work? A. If I may make one comment, certainly I have gotreservations about what is said at the end of paragraph 11 about instructions inwriting, I do not think time allows for that, but I do think there is force in thesuggestion earlier in paragraph 11 that in a particular case he should receivebriefing through one single channel. I think in this particular case there wasconfusion as between the Foreign Office and M.I.5, and I think it would havebeen easier and better for him if he had received information through one channel.Q. The way he gets his briefing of course, these things obviously have to bedone sometimes under great pressure of time nine times out of ten is through hisgetting on to something which comes to him from the Press? A. Certainly.
Q. And he has to choose then what particular source he is going to for advice? A. Certainly.Q. He cannot himself and it would be useful if he could at once summon a co-ordinated meeting of Foreign Office, M.I.5, Home Office, whatever it is,so he is really always making his enquiries from point to point, as it were? A.Could I make two comments on that: first, in this particular case, when he was originally phoned up, he said: &quot; I know nothing about this &quot;, and put the enquirerson to the press section in the Ministry of Defence, and in this particular case it wasnot a case of him getting on to the Foreign Office, he would not know theForeign Office were involved, it was a question of Foreign Office via M.I.5getting on to him. But in general what I would like to suggest and I was coming to this point later is that I think the procedure would work better if wehad a designated officer in the Ministry of Defence, and I think it should be atunder-secretary level, someone who would be my sort of No. 2 on this, so thaton any case where Lohan got an enquiry and did not know whom to get onto he would go to this particular under-secretary in the Ministry of Defence, whowould then get in touch with the other departments as concerned, or would cometo me as necessary, but this would provide one general focal point for all colonel lohan&apos;s enquiries and I think this would improve the procedure.Q. You do not think that would cut Colonel Lohan off in a way that hewould find crippling? It would mean his working through this man, would it not? A. No, I would not say that this would be an exclusive channel. Ifhe knew that some other department was concerned, and if he had a contact inthat department, I certainly would not object to him using that channel. ButI think it would be useful if he kept the single under-secretary in the Ministry ofDefence informed of what was going on, in case the thing was going to blow up.Q. And he would be someone who would have sufficient understanding as towhether to get hold of the other departments interested, and try to get out a minute which would represent an effective view? A. That is right. (Mr.Wilson): As I understand it, it is fairly simple to designate on a particular&apos; D &apos; notice whether the information which it is designed to protect falls pre-dominantly in the defence field, as Sir James has said, i.e. movements of troopsor particular types of weapons, or whether it is more in the intelligence/securityfield, . . . What I think we had in mind in this proposal is that you could, when you draw up a &apos; D &apos; notice, say that the department primarily interested wouldbe the Ministry of Defence or M.I.5, and that department would then normally be the point of contact with the Secretary of the &apos; D&apos; Notice Committee, . . .What we felt was that if you started off with this sort of initial designation,that prima facie any questions on this particular &apos; D&apos; notice should be referredto the Ministry of Defence or M.I.5, then with the procedure which Sir Jameshas mentioned there would be a long-stop to deal with the rogue one which did not fall neatly into any category. sQ. This would not appear in the form of the &apos;D&apos; notices? A. No, thiswould be an arrangement on the official side to help the secretary in dealingwith enquiries from the press side.Q. Yes, that might help. A. (Sir James Dunnett): Then, if I could go onabout the composition of the committee, we feel that instead of having, inaddition to myself as chairman on the official side, three Second P.U.S.&apos;s fromthe Ministry of Defence and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of technology, one Second P.U.S. from the Ministry of Defence would be enough,plus the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Technology, with a DeputyUnder-Secretaiy of the Foreign Office and the Permanent Secretary or the deputy secretary from the Home Office. We think this would give a better balancedcommittee than the one we have got at the moment, and I would also like to add the under-secretary from the Ministry of Defence to whom I have referred,who would be the central contact point with Colonel Lohan.Q. You have passed over paragraph 12, and I think perhaps we ought to havea word about that in a moment, but on paragraph 13, the composition of thecommittee, you cut down the people who are left over from the three separate257
defence ministries, but you add the Home Office, you add your new idea ofthe central contact man in the Ministry of Defence, but would it be wise to getithe Foreign Office avowedly on this?   It would create great press suspicion,&apos;I think. A. I certainly do not feel very strongly about this one.Q----Mr. Shinwell: I am bound to say that I find nothing in this memorandum which deals with this kind of case which is under review. A. I think we havemissed out the system of appeal, and I think this does come closer to thisparticular case.Q. I was looking at your summary of recommendations. You see, yoursuggestion is, at the top of page 10:&quot; There should be provision that where there is disagreement between thesecretary and a newspaper over the publication of an item, the matter should be referred to the chairman of the committee so that he may havean opportunity of discussing it with a representative of the unofficial sideof the committee or with the editor of the newspaper concerned &quot;.but disagreement about what? Disagreement about a &apos; D&apos; notice, whether the&apos; D &apos; notice should be published or whether it should not be published, or adisagreement as to whether it is a valid &apos; D &apos; notice? That is the difficulty which has arisen on this particular case. You see, in this particular caseColonel Lohan obtained some information on Thursday, then he has discussions on Friday with one of the departments or several of the departments; he receives some kind of instructions, but he is told apparently, according to theevidence: &quot; Do not say too much, be very careful what you are saying&quot;.Whether this helped him or whether it confused him, I am not prepared to say at the moment. Then on the Monday he has a lunch, and there are doubts about whether it is a &apos; D&apos; notice or not. This is how it goes on. I do not see how this helps. And if we come back to the suggestion you were putting, you can appoint a single person who will represent all the departments concerned,the Home Office, the Ministry of Technology and what have you, but similar difficulties could arise. Then what is done? You leave it to the chairman.If there is ample time to communicate with the editor of a particular newspaper,I can understand it, but suppose there is not time? And over this weekendapparently there was not time. A. Over the weekend, Chapman Pincher had agreed to hold the story until he could have this lunch. But I am sorry, Imissed paragraph 12, and I wanted to say something on that, because I thinkit is very relevant to the point which Mr. Shinwell has raised. I think we are all very conscious of the difficulties to which reference has just been made,and I think it was because of that that Colonel Lohan has suggested this stopprocedure. I am bound to say that I find very considerable difficulties about this. I did in fact have some discussion with the Press members of the com-mittee, as to whether they would be prepared to appoint a vice-chairman, andI had two things in mind there: primarily, somebody that I could get in touchwith on general matters fairly quickly, and secondly, somebody to whom I couldtalk on a particular case. They said they would think about this, but they made it pretty clear at my meeting that they would find it very difficult to nominate a press man who would get involved in a particular episode, because this would mean one representative of the press, or connected with the press,interfering with a story which another newspaper had got, and they made it quite clear to me that they would find this very difficult as an idea to go along with. So I think Colonel Lohan&apos;s idea of this referee sub-committee will not really work. Having said that, then one of course is left with the very point to which Mr. Shinwell has referred, which is a very difficult one. I think one has got to accept it that the basis of the whole system is a voluntary one, thatthere always will be cases where an editor, although he has been told that theofficial view is that it is covered by &apos; D &apos; notices, may chance his arm. I personally feel that this is just one of the inevitable ingredients of the system.But I think if Colonel Lohan, operating with an under-secretary, referred difficultcases of this kind to the chairman, I think it would be up to the chairman to try and get in touch with the editor himself, and I would not like to say morethan that this might help.   I do not see that even if I spoke to the editor, the
editor would necessarily can the story, but I think it might reinforce whateverrepresentations had already been made by Colonel Lohan. This I know is not afull answer to the point which has been raised, but I am bound to say thatit is as far as I think we can go, given the nature of the system.Q. But supposing there are doubts about whether the &apos; D&apos; notice is valid ornot, there is some disagreement, is it not very much better if somebody of highrank, in the department not a Minister, but a high ranking civil servant makes the approach? This is no disrespect to Colonel Lohan at all, but itdoes seem to me that he is placed in a somewhat inferior position: he has to askfor advice, to take instructions from somebody who is armed with authority,and who the editor recognises is a person who is armed with authority. A. i thought what I had said went quite a long way to meet that point. I envisaged that in this kind of case, I, as chairman of the committee, would try and get intouch with the editor, and if necessary I could get somebody from the department concerned also to speak to the editor. I thought my suggestion went at anyrate some way to meet the point you have raised, that I would envisage thechairman of the committee being brought in and speaking to the editor himself.Chairman: I think we may have failed to realise that Colonel Lohan cannotbe an Admiral Thomson. He may become one over the years, but AdmiralThomson had such a special position with everybody? A. He had indeed,certainly.Q. So Colonel Lohan may need reinforcing. I was wondering whether we might think over the points you have raised, and just finish off on the nextoccasion we meet you, because I have one or two questions about the possibilityof a vice-chairman. I see that he cannot be an active press man, but I wonderwhether he could not be an elder statesman of the press? A. I think that iswell worth thinking about. I think there are these two categories. I am boundto say that I as chairman would welcome a vice-chairman on the press side, not so much to deal with these very hot cases, but it is a very cumbrous procedureat the moment, having to summon the whole committee, and I would like to feel that there was one man to whom I could go regularly whenever anythingcame up. Whether he could be used in individual cases and if he was anelder statesman he probably could be used is something worth thinking about.All I can say at the moment is that the press members of my committee have considerable reservations as to whether even an elder statesman would feeldisposed to come in. (Mr. Drew): Bearing upon what Mr. Shinwell has said,I have had a great many years&apos; experience of particular cases, and this one isalmost unique, in fact I think it is unique in my experience. In cases where we have had difficulties in the past, it has been evident to the press what thepoint at issue is ; for example, we had trouble, or the Foreign Office had trouble,about the case of George Blake ; there was another case-about another defector,Dolnytsin, and certainly on &apos; D &apos; notice issues it is quite clear, and it is a matterof clear interpretation of the &apos; D &apos; notice, whether the thing is in or outside. Theproblem here and I know of no other case like it was one in which the matter was so secret that the Foreign Office were unwilling to tell the facts to the press,and accordingly Lohan was put into the difficulty of having to attempt to interpreta &apos; D &apos; notice without being able to say and the press did not know either &quot; This particular &apos; D &apos; notice of 1961 covers this particular piece &quot;, without being able to say why. I think the situation is unique in my experience, and onehopes that it may not occur again.Q. . . .(At this stage the proceedings were adjourned sine die)
Minutes of a Meeting of the Commtttee held m theCabinet Office on Monday, 10th April, 1967, at 3.00 p.m.Present:Lord Radcliffe (Chairman)Mr. E. ShinwellMr. Selwyn LloydMr. D. J. Trevelyan (Secretary)The following gave evidence: At 3 p.m.        Sir James DunnettMr. J. M. wilson mr. J. A. DrewChairman of Services, Press and Broad-casting CommitteeDeputy Under-Secretary of State (Admin.),Ministry of DefenceAssistant Under-Secretary of State (Per-sonnel) (Defence Secretariat)Chairman: There are one or two points, Sir James, that I wanted to follow up with you and your colleagues when you left us the other day, apart from furtherexplorations of what you were saying. There are two points which are raisedby a paper which has been sent in to us by the Institute of Journalists, whohave now merged with the other body. They confess they do not know muchabout &apos; D&apos; notices themselves or the working of the system, but they raise two things on which I would like to hear the views of your committee. One is a fairly straightforward thing, that &apos; D &apos; notices can get left outstanding over theyears and the wording which may have been appropriate when a particularsituation was called for may in fact cease to be so appropriate. They say oneof the things which would be useful would be to have a regular arrangement for a set review by the committee of what is outstanding and consideration ofwhat can be either thrown away or re-worded. What do you think of that? A. (Sir James Dunnett): I do agree with that. In fact all the &apos; D&apos; noticeshave been under review in the last eighteen months and this process is pratically complete. So one will then have an up-to-date set of &apos; D&apos; notices. But I certainly agree that ought to be regularly kept up to date.Q. As we know, there are sixteen outstanding today. And I think one of the lessons of this particular incident may be that whatever the &apos; D&apos; notice ofApril, 1956, meant at the time it is very difficult after interpretations of a par-ticular kind have been given to know what it means today. You would agreethat a set review is necessary? A. Certainly. I think it worth making thepoint that experience of this review which has been going on over the last eighteen months or two years shows it is a lengthy process getting agreement on the exactwording of &apos; D &apos; notices. But provided it was not done too frequently I think theyshould be reviewed from time to time and kept up to date.Q. Yes, I know the wording is difficult. But it might lead to one. or two ofthem being done away with, which would be of value for its own sake. A.Certainly.Q. Another thing worried me as we took the evidence over this case, and Ithink you may be able to help me here. On the Monday, the day before the daily Express thing came up, about seven o&apos;clock the secretary came to you and reported what he then understood the position to be? A. Yes.Q. Did you get the impression at that time that he was relying in any effective way on the wording of the &apos; D &apos; notices? A. The report he gave me was to this effect this was the first time I had heard about this at all, I had just been broughtinto it the impression he left with me definitely was that this thing had been going on, he thought it was all in hand, that whatever the final outcome chapman pincher had given him certain assurances and that therefore he was as certainas he could be that anyhow it would not appear in next day&apos;s Daily Express.
That is the clear impression I got from him. And this ties up with his own) account, that he was certainly relying on Chapman Pincher to come back tohim if there was any difficulty about it. And I got the impression that he wasrelaxed about it and was pretty definite it would not appear in next day&apos;sExpress.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: On the other hand, there was something about &quot; thin ice &quot;.Chairman: Yes. He said &quot; I am skating on very thin ice, but I think I amholding the ground&quot;. Do you recall those words? A. I do not recall thosewords, I certainly don&apos;t. I think he may well have said to me &quot; It has not beenvery easy, because I have had certain instructions from the Foreign Office notto rely too much on the particular &apos; D&apos; notice &quot;. But I do not recall him using the words &quot; thin ice &quot;.Q. I am not actually clear what &quot; relying too much on the &apos; D&apos; notice &quot; means I am not criticising your phrase. A. (Mr. Wilson): No, those were thewords he repeated on a subsequent occasion. I was not present when colonel lohan saw Sir James on the first occasion, but on the subsequent occasion I canconfirm what Sir James has said. A. (Mr. Drew): He certainly repeated thosewords when I spoke to him on the Tuesday to get some amplification.Q. What is meant by not relying too much on it? A. (Sir James Dunnett):To be quite honest, Lord Radcliffe, I think myself that this was part of thedifficulty in which Lohan found himself. I think between ourselves that theremay have been I do not know if a misunderstanding is the right word, but I am bound to say if I had been in Lohan&apos;s position I think I would have wished topress the people who instructed me more strongly on this point and said &quot; Youput me in a very difficult position if you give me those instructions.&quot;Q. Yes, I can see that would probably have been better if from the first hehad said &quot; This &apos; D &apos; notice thing is very difficult to work with the wording ofthe &apos; D&apos; notices as they are&quot;. But let us leave that at the moment. Whatworries me is if you do not rely too much on what was the critical &apos; D&apos; noticeyou then have to travel outside the field of &apos; D &apos; notices and make an appealeither on grounds of personal friendship or general goodwill or future happyrelations between the government and the newspaper, general public importance on other than &apos; D &apos; notice grounds, etc., etc., etc. Now, it may be he did workvery hard on those fines this time. But is that a satisfactory function for thesecretary of your &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee? A. Could I just perhaps add a glossto that? I think Lohan&apos;s account of his conversation with Chapman Pinchershows that everything he said to Chapman Pincher was based on the generalspirit of &apos; D &apos; notices. There was the argument about the precise wording ofthe two &apos; D&apos; notices in question, and at one stage Lohan said &quot; Let us put thoseaside and talk about the general spirit of &apos; D &apos; notices.&quot; I would entirely agreethat the function of the secretary of this committee-his position stems from&apos; D &apos; notices. I do not regard him as having any locus unless &apos; D &apos; notices, eitherparticularly or in general, apply. So in so far as he was being asked to developan argument which was not related in some way to &apos; D&apos; notices, then I thinkhe was being put in a false position. But I think you may get situations where you have to take a broad view of the spirit of &apos; D &apos; notices, and you can havean argument about whether a particular sentence applies, but I think it wouldbe fair in such a circumstance to argue as Lohan did that whatever interpretationcould be put on a particular sentence in a particular &apos; D&apos; notice he was saying&apos; Look, this is contrary to the general spirit of the &apos; D&apos; notices as a whole &quot;.But I entirely agree his position stems entirely from the interpretation of &apos; D&apos;notices individually and collectively.Q. How would you interpret the meaning of what he calls the spirit, becausethe weight of it is that a particular form of words has been considered with government representatives and press representatives and that this amount of restriction has been agreed? What can the spirit of a &apos;D&apos; notice do for you that an agreed &apos; D&apos; notice does not do? A. I think what Lohan was effectivelytrying to argue in this case was they had had a considerable argument about aparticular interpretation to be placed on a particular sentence of the &apos; D&apos;261
notice. Lohan was not saying he accepted Chapman Pincher&apos;s argument that it did not apply, but he was saying &quot; You must take it from me, Chapman Pincher,!that what is involved here are important security interests to the State, andI am saying to you from what I know of the thing you must take it from methat these are important security aspects, and it is this kind of thing that &apos; D &apos;notices are designed to protect&quot;.Q. But if there is an emergency system for the issuance of &apos; D&apos; notices whichdoes not invite the summoning of the whole committee, is that not the way inwhich one should add a security requirement to one&apos;s request to the press? A.I am sorry . . .?Q. This story had been about since Thursday of the preceding week. ByFriday at any rate Colonel Lohan was told that the government attached greatimportance to this not coming out. And the way to deal with that if it is not covered by &apos; D &apos; notice, is it not, is to try and get an emergency meeting of the inner group of your &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee, which includes three press repre-sentatives? A. I certainly agree, and I said this myself last time. I think there must be some machinery under which given this kind of situation I can get in touch urgently with either one or two or three people urgently on the pressside. One of the difficulties at the present time is that most of them are workingjournalists, and to get the whole committee together takes days and this is notquick enough. I think it would help greatly given this kind of situation if therewere one or two people on the press side I could get in touch with urgently.But thinking about the events of this particular instance, I think Lohan&apos;s accountshows he was trying to get in touch with Chapman Pincher on Saturday andSunday, but it turned out that Monday was the earliest time they could meet.And at that time I do not myself think that Lohan regarded it as hopeless to persuade Chapman Pincher. I think he may have thought it was going to bedifficult, given his instructions. And part of the trouble was that the people whoinstructed him wanted him to be pretty cagey in what he said about what was really going on. But Lohan I think really thought he was going to persuadeChapman Pincher not to publish.Q. Yes. I did not quite want to tie my question down to the actual incident. A. No. More generally I do accept that if there is any difficulty we have gotto have a procedure under which the chairman is brought in automatically andpretty quickly, and I think it is very necessary that there should be one or twopeople on the press side that he can get in touch with very urgently if he wants to consult them.Q. I am right in thinking you can do it now if you can get three press peopletogether, am I not? A. Yes, but I am bound to say my experience of these thingsis that it is a very loose arrangement, and it is very difficult at the moment tofind where these press men are and to get them quickly enough to deal with this situation. -j-Q. I am really on the philosophy of the thing for the future. Should there be a place for the secretary to say &quot; There are &apos; D &apos; notices. You may well be right in saying this is not covered by them, but I can assure you that this is a&apos; D&apos; notice matter and I hope you will not publish &quot;? Should there not be away of telling the press representative this where necessary and to issue thenecessary supplementary &apos; D &apos; notice ? A. Yes, I think there are two points about this. I certainly think in this kind of situation it would help, and it is the viewof my colleagues, if I were able to get in touch pretty urgently with a seniorpress man on the committee and say &quot; Look, we are in this trouble &quot;. Clearly,that chap would have to be fully cleared securitywise. And the other point whichI think is difficult is it might have to be somebody who was not a practisingjournalist himself. And I think one would find the average working journalistreluctant to take a line on a story which another journalist had got. I thinkhe would say he might be regarded as prejudiced if he was preventing a journalistfrom publishing a story. So it might have to be a member of the committeewho was not actually a practising journalist. But we could get over that, I think.
Q. Yes. Do you think there is a likelihood of getting what we called last(time an elder statesman as a regular opposite number to you? A. If the presswere prepared to play in this I do not see why you should not get somebody whowould fulfil the role, but obviously it would have to be somebody who lived inLondon. The predecessor was a retired journalist and lived in Yorkshire, and Ido not think that would do, because speed is of the essence.Q. Then you say you would have to P.V. him? A. Well, this is the dilemma,is it not? This is something one would have to consider. If you have a caselike this one, and if I was going to have a reasonable discussion with him and say &quot; Look, I have been into this and I really think this is an important securityissue and it is covered by &apos; D &apos; notice&quot;, and if he was going to express areasonable opinion would he not want to know exactly what was going on?Q. Yes, I wondered. I merely wanted you to pause on that to see that ifthe approach is to be successful it does not allow for over-prudence. Very oftenthere is give and take between government interests and press interests. what i was wondering was whether a senior man of authority such as yourself I aminstancing that as you are chairman and in the middle of the thing could not say what was reasonably prudent and yet informative to any editor without the editor being invited to go through the P.V. process. A. My view on that wouldbe this: I think even if the journalist was not fully cleared there would bevalue in such a system, and of course in certain circumstances you would haveto take it from me that I was telling you the truth I think it would still be worth doing. I was merely making the point that if one was going to be completely frank with the journalist in this kind of case he would have to be fully P.V.&apos;d, but I think it would be worth doing still if he was not.Q. I do not think he would expect you to be perfectly frank. A. (Mr. Drew):You will recall the requirements for P.V. constant regular access to top secretor atomic information and spasmodic instances would not fall strictly withinthe definition, but I fully endorse that to be frank with a journalist you would need to have an assurance that he was fully reliable.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: You were talking of someone on the committee.Chairman: We were. My own question had gone rather off that to a high level of approach by the secretary to an editor who considered that &apos; D&apos; noticesdid not appear to apply but the government would be very anxious about it.A. (Sir James Dunnett): This would be to the editor.Q. Yes, I was thinking of that; sometimes it may have to work that way. A. Yes, I would accept that.Q. A good deal of what the government is very anxious about in this fieldI think could be found in the secret files of a number of newspaper officesanyway. It is their business to know and record these things. But the thingsdo not come out; the knowledge is probably there, but it is safeguarded. AndI wonder if we are not being perhaps over-careful about this thing, about details and frankness. A. Yes. I certainly would not disagree that I think it would be definitely useful if in a case of this kind I could get in touch with a seniorrepresentative 01?* the committee, and I do agree there might be cases whereit would be useful if I as the chairman of the committee got on to the editorconcerned.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: I assume, so far as dealing with the member of thecommittee is concerned, that would be for advice, or would it be for thepossibility of three being assembled? That seems to be rather a different thingthan going straight to the editor. And I would have thought that where you have got a big one it is a question of going straight to the editor.Chairman: That was rather in my mind. The only thing is editors do not always know how many other newspapers in competition with them may have got, or be immediately likely to get, the same story. The emergency &apos; D &apos; notice is much better to deal with that situation than the direct approach to the oneeditor. One sees a little of this in the Daily Mail I Daily Express. A. (Mr.Drew): I am not altogether clear how if you chose this form of publishing an
emergency &apos; D &apos; notice what indeed you would say in this &apos; D.&apos; notice. I go back to the only case we have, this particular case. What could you have saidjin an emergency notice which would have shown the press that this was some-thing they must keep away from without at the same time telling them, perhaps a hundred people, the essentials of the various things which it was Lohan&apos;business and Lohan&apos;s instructions to try to hide?Q. It has always been the risk of &apos; D&apos; notices, that you do give away to theeditorial range of people a certain amount of things that ideally you would liketo conceal. I accept that. A. In general terms you say &quot; You must not printstories about intelligence methods&quot;, and if the journalist knows this is anintelligence method, with an awful lot of them there is no problem. But in thisparticular instance this was a unique case, in which Lohan knew, the ForeignOffice certainly knew, but the journalist did not know or claimed he did not,that this was an intelligence operation. If you had issued an emergency noticeabout this you would have told a hundred people what this specific thing wasabout. This is why I feel it would be better to limit your area of approach andto tell the editor concerned, even though it may be that you have to tell someother editor.Q. Choice of risks, I quite agree. I think one has always had to realise thedifficulty of &apos; D &apos; notices is they do indicate anxiety where other people may notrealise there is anxiety. A. This is true.Q. And give a hint as to what the cause of the anxiety is. A. Yes.Chairman. I think it is very interesting. Is there any more on that point thatyou want to say? A. (Sir James Dunnett): I do not think so.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: It seems to me that really there are two fields for these&apos; D&apos; notices. Looking through them, details of ... . There it seems to me thesystem is almost ideal, something absolutely specific, everybody knows exactly what you are talking about, and I would have thought the system had worked therevery well in that case. It seems to me there is a slightly different techniqueneeded when you come to intelligence. And I am not quite happy that the structure, even as you suggest it, is the right one for dealing with the intelligenceside. A. I certainly agree they raise a very different kind of problem, but I am not convinced that the machinery could not be made to deal with both of them.Q. I think it is almost a miracle you have got these &apos; D &apos; notices accepted in the terms they are, dealing with intelligence matters, because they really covereverything, and if they cover everything, do they cover anything? That is thepoint.  They are so general. A. Yes.Mr. Shinwell: I would like Sir James to clarify one or two points for me. AsI understand it, what you are saying is that looking to the future whoever issecretary of the Press and Broadcasting Committee should regard his primaryfunction, indeed his sole function, as being concerned with the &apos; D &apos; noticeprocedure? A. Yes.Q. When a matter of general security emerges, intelligence, it is not hisfunction to deal with it? A. Except in so far as the &apos; D &apos; notice is involved.Q. And if he fails to convince the press that this is a valid &apos; D &apos; notice, then he is out it is not his business? A. With the slight qualification that, as I mentioned earlier, I think he is entitled in a particular case, if there is a kind ofsemantic argument going on, to say &quot; Look, I really do feel strongly that in thisparticular case this is the kind of thing that is covered by the spirit of the &apos; D &apos;notices &quot;. I quite agree this is slightly difficult, but I can imagine cases whereI think it would not be improper for him to say &quot;You, Journalist X, may notthink this is covered by this particular sentence I am referring to, but I wouldlike to put the argument to you that this is a matter where the important matterof State security is involved, and it is covered by the general approach of &apos; D&apos;notices.&quot;  I agree this is rather tricky ground, and I think in such circumstances
the press are entitled to take their own view. But I do not think he should be(stopped from taking a somewhat wider view of what the &apos; D &apos; notices are meant to cover provided it is in the ambit of &apos; D&apos; notices, but he cannot argue outsidethe &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. But if the press say &quot; This is nothing to do with the &apos; D &apos; notices &quot;? A.There is nothing more he can do. In those circumstances he has to report tothe chairman of the committee.Q. In this particular instance what happened is this: he met Chapman Pincher,he produced the &apos; D &apos; notices and Chapman Pincher said &quot; I know all about that,I am quite familiar with that sort of thing &quot;, and Lohan put them back in hispocket and he began to argue on grounds of intelligence, general security, butthat did not convince Chapman Pincher, and apparently did not convince the daily Express editor. That is the issue. How are you going to overcome that difficulty? And there is the dilemma that in order to convince the press you may have to tell them the story, or a large part of it, and you cannot afford todo that. A. (Mr. Drew): Precisely. And I suggest instead of putting this infor-mation you wish to conceal in a kind of emergency notice, that Sir James&apos;suggestion that he might deal direct with the editor and tell the editor what isnecessary in the circumstances of the time, what the facts are, does tend to holdthis piece of information within a much smaller area.Q. But here he tried his best with Chapman Pincher. They were there casuallyat lunch, the &apos; D &apos; notices were put aside, and then they had a general discussionfor about two hours what they talked about I don&apos;t know, it was not very clear from the evidence. But surely if an emergency arises and the &apos; D&apos; noticeprocedure is not accepted by the press and there is a threat to publish the story,it ought to be taken up with somebody of high rank, somebody who could speak with authority? A. (Sir James Dunnett): In this particular case, accordingto Lohan&apos;s own account, when Chapman Pincher said &quot; I know the &apos; D &apos; noticesoff by heart&quot;, Lohan himself said &quot; All right, lefs put them aside and argueabout basic issues &quot;. And at the end of the lunch Lohan was of the impressionhe had convinced Chapman Pincher, and Chapman Pincher had promised not to publish the story without getting back to him. That is what he reported to meat 7 o&apos;clock in the evening. I think if Chapman Pincher said &quot; I do not accept &apos; D /&apos; notices apply here &quot; this would be a very different position at 2.30than the position that Lohan reported back. Lohan was clearly of the impression that he had convinced Chapman Pincher and Chapman Pincher was going tosee the editor, and that even if the editor was not convinced, Chapman Pincherwould come back to him before deciding to publish, and the matter would betaken higher.Q. But preceding that he had been in touch with the Ministry of Defence andthe Foreign Office, and they had given him instructions. A. He was getting his instructions direct from the Foreign Office, MI.5.Q. But by this time they were aware that Chapman Pincher did not accept the&apos; D &apos; notice procedure. A. No, because my understanding is Lohan had been trying to get hold of Chapman Pincher over the weekend, and was not able toorganise a discussion until the lunchtime on the Monday.Q. If the Foreign Office, whoever he met, instructed him &quot; This is a &apos; D &apos; noticeprocedure&quot; why was it that when he met Chapman Pincher and chapman pincher said &quot; I know about the &apos; D&apos; notices, I am familiar with them &quot; but hewould not accept that the procedure would apply, Lohan began to discuss basicissues? If the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence and the officials hemet said this was confined to &apos; D ? notice procedure, why did he then proceed todiscuss basic issues? Had he any authority to do that? A. This is why I madethe point I did, this reference to Lohan&apos;s paragraph 14. What Lohan meant by saying &quot; basic issues &quot; was in his own words &quot; the broad meaning and spiritof the notices &quot;. That is why I was making this point. He has no locus unless&apos; D &apos; notices are involved, and the line he was taking with Chapman Pincher was:&quot; You say the particular &apos; D &apos; notices to which I refer do not apply. I do not accept that.   But even if I did accept that I still put it to you, and you must
accept this from me, that in this case publication would be contrary to thegeneral meaning and spirit of the notices&quot;. Now, I will accept that I think thislis, using the words Lord Radcliffe used earlier, &quot; thin ice &quot;, and I think one couldargue that unless a specific &apos; D &apos; notice does apply, more general arguments donot carry perhaps a great deal of weight. But I think those were the broadlines which Lohan was proceeding on. My own personal view is, as I saidearlier, that if I had been in Lohan&apos;s position I think I would have queried theinstructions I had been given.Chairman: Yes, I quite follow that.Mr. Shinwell: One final point. Lohan came and reported to you in the evening of Monday. By this time the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence,all regarded this as a matter of considerable importance. A. (Mr. Wilson): Notthe Ministry of Defence. (Sir James Dunnett): Could I make it quite clear?All the instructions had gone to Lohan from MI. 5, the Foreign Office; we atthe Ministry of Defence had not been involved. Lohan reported to me at sevenoelock as chairman of the committee. This was the first I had heard of it.What he reported to me was he was in touch with the Foreign Office about this, no need really to bother because he had had this lunch with chapman pincher, Chapman Pincher had promised to get back to him if there was anyquestion of publication, he thought he had convinced Chapman Pincher, andthat was the position when he came to see me.Q. Sir James, what I am trying to elicit is this it is a point of elucidationif you would be good enough to help me. What I am trying to find out is this:in the conversations that Lohan had with people at the Foreign Office not theMinistry of Defence, because you were not involved in what had happened they assured him that this was a matter of supreme importance, must not givetoo much away, make the best of it, try and convince Chapman Pincher that the&apos; D &apos; notice procedure applied, and if he is not convinced you must try and find some way of dealing with the basic issues, whatever it was. But when he came to you and said he thought that he had convinced Chapman Pinchersurely by this time the Ministry of Defence should have known that this wasa matter of considerable importance. That was the view of the Foreign Office.And why allow him to go home then on the assumption that he merely thoughtthat Chapman Pincher did not intend to proceed? Surely some action shouldhave been taken at that stage. No action was taken in point of fact until theForeign Secretary &apos;phoned Sir Max Aitken after ten oelock at night. A. first of all, I think we must get it clear that although I happen to be chairman ofthis committee Lohan at the moment gets his instructions, according to the natureof the case, from various sources. He was instructed in the whole of this by theForeign Office that is point No. 1. My second point is that he had reported(a) that he thought he had convinced Chapman Pincher and (b) that he had hadan assurance from Chapman Pincher that if there was any question of his editortaking a different view he would get back on to Lohan. So given that situation it was not clear what more could be done with Chapman Pincher. This is what was reported, that he had been given these assurances (Mr. Drew):Could I add something in elucidation? That is that at 9.30 the situation hadin fact changed. At 9.30 it was known that the Daily Express was going to print. Chapman Pincher rang up Lohan and told him so. It was thereafter thatthe Foreign Secretary tried to get in touch, but failed, with Sir Max Aitken.Q. Precisely but it was too late. A. Yes, but up to 9.30, as Sir James said,we were entitled to assume that Lohan&apos;s view was right, that if you had gone to Sir Max Aitken or Mr. Derek Marks, the editor, between seven o&apos;clock and.30 you would have had to tell them facts in order to convince them, whichin Lohan&apos;s view was unnecessary.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: You do not think you were put on notice that somethingwas up when Chapman Pincher said he was going to write the story for the editor to look at it? I think Ewart Biggs was told that. A. He may have been,but I do not think it would necessarily have altered the situation. The editorwould clearly want to see in what form the story if printed would appear in
order to make a judgment. And with the greatest respect I think that betweenseven o&apos;clock and 9.30 to have got on to the editor would have been a beltand braces operation which would, it was hoped, prove unnecessary.Mr. Shinwell: You say you would have had to tell something of the story and you could not afford to do that? A. Of course.Q. That I understand. But have there not been cases in the past where the editor was approached but he did not expect to know the whole story and yetrefrained from publishing? A. I cannot think of one which is precisely com-parable with this one.Q. Could I put it this way: ordinarily a responsible editor would not publishif approached by somebody in authority, either Ministry of Defence or ForeignOffice, with an appeal not to publish? &quot;I cannot tell you the whole story&quot; that is how it would be put &quot; but we beg of you not to publish &quot;? A. I think this might work in a number of cases. I am bound to be doubtful, and I amspeaking here from a fairly long experience of this sort of thing, whether itwould have worked in this particular case. The difficulty here was, as I under-stand it, that Pincher had one view of the facts in his mind which he hadpresumably communicated to the editor and he had thought this was a kind of I think the phrase is a sort of &quot; Big Brother &quot; interrogation that we were allunder every time we sent a telegram which was looked at by some nameless,faceless people in Whitehall. This is the sort of story which, as I understand it,Pincher had. The only way you could have got that out of his mind, and since he put it into his editor&apos;s mind, the only way you could have got that out of his mind, in fact, would have been to tell the editor what the facts really were. This I come back to my point between seven and nine-thirty seemed to be an unnecessary thing to do.   By the light of hindsight perhaps it was not.Chairman: Mr. Drew, what misled people, if that is right, was surely in theend misplaced confidence of Colonel Lohan? A. Yes.Q. And the belief that twenty-four hours at any rate were in hand for any final action? A. That is right.Q. He thought he was fairly sure there would not be anything in the daily express on Tuesday morning. Nobody was reasoning how much can we tell the editor because the crisis had not come to a head? A. The crisis had not come to a head and if you had assumed the crisis had come to a head you hadLohan&apos;s view that the thing was all right.Q. Yes. A. On both counts. It is very difficult to say what could have beendone without conceivably making the incident seem worse between these 2  vitalhours, to which Mr. Shinwell has drawn attention.Q. People were not really thinking about what to do in those 2  hours. A. No, they were not.  There was nothing to think about.Q. So much depends upon the relationship between the highly placed person on the Government side and a particular editor. All sorts of things, to myexperience, could have been done. A. True.(Discussion continued off the record)A. ... &apos;Q. You say it does mean something more? A. It means the particular incidentwe are now discussing. I would have said that is precisely what it meant.Q. I would not blame anybody who did not know that. A. I would agree with you. That is the central difficulty we are in, in trying to describe something,the nature of which nobody has known.Q. I entirely agree with this.   If you want a &apos; D&apos; notice system at all I think you have to accept this as one of the incidental risks. A. This is true.Chairman: Is that all for the moment we can say about that? I am lookingback through what you told us last time in case there is anything left outstandingthat you wanted to add or if there is anything further we wanted to ask you.
Mr. Shinwell: Could I ask a quesion about the 1961/62 Report, paragraph 139?Chairman: Yes.Mr. Shinwell: Because this refers to the personality of the secretary which isvery important, I think. Does it not call for the appointment of somebody ofconsiderable experience, not merely somebody who has been, say, a public relationsofficer? A. (Sir James Dunnett): Yes.Q. In a department or an ex-serving officer, but somebody who is acquaintedtvith the methods of the Press, who is persona grata with the Press, and canspeak with some authority on behalf of the Government department? A. Iwould certainly agree with that.Q. Whose views would be generally acceptable to editors of responsible news-papers? A. Yes.Q. Does it not call for that? A. I would certainly agree those are the kinds ofqualities for which one is looking. The question is, of course, whether one is going to find somebody with all those qualities prepared to do this particular,rather funny kind of job. Certainly I would agree with that as a specificationfor the job, and, of course, it does raise the question which is also referred toin this Report. I personally think, although it is a very fluctuating job, it is by no means true he is busy the whole time. I think probably he needs moreassistance because this is a twenty-four hour service, seven days a week.Chairman: Yes. A. Certainly somebody who has the confidence of the Press,but also tire full confidence of the official side, this is very important.Q. Yes. You are happy about the suggestion about which we were talkinglast time, to add an avowedly Foreign Office representative? A. I wanted tosay a word about that. I have been thinking about that since we were here lasttime. I think it is largely a question of how one actually phrases it. I thinkwhat we really are saying is the scope of the representation on the official sideshould be broadened, to cover particularly the Home Office, and ... if one usedsome expression to the effect &quot; and such other department as may be affectedby the &apos; D&apos; notice procedure&quot;, thus leaving it slightly open exactly how onedoes it.Q. Yes. I am sure it would be possible to do that, but in the end it would lead to you proposing at some stage to your Press colleagues that a Foreign Officeman should come on? A. Certainly.Q. With the necessity to explain why he was there? A. I think one couldexplain it on the grounds that the &apos; D &apos; Notice Committee, the Press and Broad-casting Committee, is concerned with defence interests across the board and,of course, the Foreign Office are concerned with defence interests overseas andI think one could give a reasonable explanation for it.[Chairman]: I think I have asked everything I had in mind. Have you anything more to add, Sir James? A. Could I just come back to the point Mr. SelwynLloyd did raise. Subject to the views of my colleagues, I think that there wouldbe advantage in having a clearly laid down procedure that when any issue of major importance arose in the intelligence field, the Ministry of Defence shouldbe brought in at the earliest possible opportunity.  I do very much agree with that.Q. Would you please say that again? A. I was just following up the pointMr. Selwyn Lloyd made. I think the point he was making was when anintelligence issue arises, it raises fairly fundamental issues as this one did. Wouldthere not be advantage if the Ministry of Defence, and, indeed, Chairman ofthe Services, Press and Broadcasting Committee, was brought in at the earliestpossible stage?Q. Yes. A. I was saying yes, I think that would be an advantage.Q. That would be because of your relationship with the Committee, notWith the Ministry, would it? A. I think in practice it would be me, but I think the point that Mr. Selwyn Lloyd was making, I think there is force in this, if Imay say so, was that the Ministry of Defence has more experience in dealing with
the procedure and that kind of thing than the Foreign Office. They get broughtinto this kind of thing once every three or five years. Therefore it is probablyme anyhow, but I think there is advantage once you are getting something thatis going to raise pretty important issues, then the Chairman, and indeed Ministryof Defence, should be brought in. They have much more experience of operatingthis system than other departments.Chairman: Yes, I follow.Mr. Shinwell: It is possible that if that had been done in this instance, itwould have saved a lot of trouble? A. I personally think it would have helpedanyhow. (Mr. Drew): I think certainly this is hindsight one would havereinforced Lohan&apos;s views subsequently expressed that he was given instructions which he really could not carry out.Chairman: Yes.  Thank you very much.(The witnesses withdrew)Minutes of a Meeting of the Committee held in theCabinet Office on Tuesday, 11th April, at 10.30 a.m.Present:Lord Radcliffe (Chairman)Mr. E. ShinwellMr. Selwyn LloydMr. D. J. Trevelyan (Secretary)The following gave evidence: At 10.30 a.m.   Mr. Nigel Lawson        Editor, Spectatoraccompanied byMr. Alan Watkins11.30 a.m.   Mr. L. J. Dicker Representative of the Newspaper Pro-proprietors&apos; Association on Services, press and Broadcasting CommitteeWitnesses: Mr. Nigel Lawson, Mr. A. WatkinsChairman: First of all, Mr. Lawson, you have been editor of the Spectatorfrom what date? A. (Mr. Lawson): Since 1st January, 1966.Q. Before that, had you come into contact with the working of the &apos; D &apos; notice system? A. I had had no direct personal contact. I was aware of it from otherjournalists, but I had no direct personal contact myself.Q. I connect you with financial journalism in the Financial Times, primarily,is that right? A. In the Financial Times and the Sunday Telegraph, and I also had a spell out of journalism.Q. So in fact as a working problem of how to interpret or what to do about&apos; D&apos; notices, it had not been part of your professional life before? A. No.My knowledge of the &apos; D &apos; notice system was chiefly from other journalists, fromthe published reports, the 1962 Report, and other sources of that kind.Q. I believe it to be the fact that since you have been in the editorial chairat the Spectator there has not been a &apos; D &apos; notice issued? A. That is right.Q. So the question of whether one reached you yourself was really beside the point?-A. That is right.Q. In your article on &apos; D&apos; notices, in the Spectator, you say: &quot; The Spectatordoes not and did not possess a single &apos; D &apos; notice&quot;. That puzzles me andthe people engaged in the working of the committee, because it is their belief that all &apos; D&apos; notices up to date have been circulated to the office address of theSpectator. When you say that, what enquiries did you make from the previouseditor, Mr. Macleod? Did you ask him whether he had ever had any? A. No.Since we possessed none, I assumed wrongly as it turned out that we were notpart of the system.   As I say, I had never had any communication at any time
from the secretary of the committee. In some ways weeklies are treated differentlyfrom other papers: we are not for example part of the lobby system, whereas the daily papers are. And of course, immediately we published the initialarticle by Watkins it was clear to me then that I had been under a misapprehen-sion, so I got in touch with Colonel Lohan. I first of all made enquiries in theoffice, and discovered that what had happened was that, I suppose in an excess ofzeal for security, the &apos; D &apos; notices as soon as they had arrived had been readand then destroyed, and the person who had destroyed them had been the editor&apos;s confidential secretary who had left, was no longer in the employ ofthe firm, and there was therefore nobody left with the paper who knew anythingabout this. When I discovered this, I told Colonel Lohan, and he said thiswas not the first time this had happened, he had discovered the N.P.A. hadbeen doing exactly the same thing with their &apos; D&apos; notices, and had put a stopto it.  But this was in fact the explanation of why we possessed none.Q. If the Spectator is going to be part of the &apos; D &apos; notice system in the future,that would not be a method of dealing with &apos; D &apos; notices which I would recommend to you. A. It would not be a method I personally would think of adopting, no.Q. First of all, I believe there are sixteen outstanding today, extending backover a very considerable period of time, therefore you are destroying the effectiveworking use of them if each editor just looks at them, memorises them anddestroys them. A. I wholeheartedly agree, yes.Q. So we may regard that as part of a mistaken policy with regard to &apos; D&apos;notices? A. Yes indeed.Q. Now I would like to come to Mr. Watkin&apos;s part in this, because there doesnot seem to be a common ground on the pure question of fact as to what happened. Mr. Watkins, when you went to Colonel Lohan&apos;s office you did not take copies with you? A. (Mr. Watkins): No, I copied out pretty well in total the &apos; D&apos; notices, in my notebook.Q. I must ask you this to begin with: did you copy out those parts of them which were headed either &quot; Private and confidential&quot; or &quot; Secret&quot;? A. Ihonestly did not notice what was on the top. I assumed it would probably have&quot; Private and confidential&quot;, but I certainly did not observe at the time that one was marked &quot; Secret&quot; and the other, I understand, &quot; Private and confidential&quot;.I copied out the body of the text, as it were.Q. I thought you might have done that. I want Mr. Lawson to remember that they in fact do all carry either the words &quot; Private and confidential&quot; or&quot; Secret&quot; on them. But you were allowed to copy out a number, if not all,of the existing &apos; D&apos; notices? No, the two that were in dispute or the two that were relevant to the particular political point I was examining.Q. Yes. We are given to understand there were two people in the office,Colonel Lohan and an assistant? A. Yes, an assistant or secretary, a middle-aged woman.Q. But we are given to understand that they both gave you a warning to theeffect that these &apos; D&apos; notices were confidential documents and that they werenot to be published?-A. No, what happened was this: I asked Colonel Lohanin the morning, having talked on an &quot; off the record &quot; basis with him about thedispute in relation to the Daily Express: &quot; Can I come along and see these &apos; D&apos;notices? &quot;, and he said: &quot;All right, but you should have copies in the office&quot;.I made no enquiries whatever in the Spectator. I went along that afternoon, tookout a notebook, copied them out, and he certainly did not say anything aboutnon-publication. The woman said, either to me or to Colonel Lohan, I forgetwhich, something to this effect: &quot; Mr. Watkins does realise that these notices areconfidential? &quot;, to which Colonel Lohan said: &quot; I do not think we need worryabout that, there are copies back in the office &quot;. I said nothing, and continuedto copy them out, and said &quot; Thank you very much &quot; and went away and put themin my article.Q. Had you any doubt, when you had finished, that in fact they were con-fidential communications? A. Oh, none at all, of course not.
Q. Then, Mr. Lawson, have you ever heard of a &apos; D &apos; notice being printed byany editor before? A. (Mr. Lawson): No.Q. Did you realise that they were circulated on the private and confidentialor secret basis? A. I realised that when they were circulated in the normal wayto newspapers, as part of the system, part of the understanding was that these would not be published by the newspapers concerned. As I said, I was underthe impression that we were not part of the system, and that since Alan Watkinshad been shown these things in the office of the Secretary, and had copied them out openly and in front of him, and there was no possible question of anysubterfuge, the question of whether we published them or not depended on two things, it seemed to me, as an editorial judgment. One of them was whether theycontained anything the publication of which would involve a breach of security,and it seemed to me quite clear that they did not, in the same way as the partsof the 1961 &apos; D &apos; notice which were published in the Report of the Committee on security Procedures in the Public Service this was an extract printed clearlyinvolved no breach of security. The second thing, because obviously this was an unprecedented step, was whether there was any special political justification, andit seemed to me there was, because it was also unprecedented that the precisewording of a &apos; D&apos; notice should become a major political issue. This had neverhappened before to my knowledge. There had been discussions in Parliamentabout the &apos; D &apos; notice system, but the precise wording of a &apos; D &apos; notice had neverbefore become a major political issue.Q. I am of course rather more concerned with the system in the future, indeedthis is why we have asked you to come. But if you had realised that theSpectator had regularly been the recipient of &apos; D &apos; notices, and in that sensewithin the system, would you have felt the same about publishing? A. I certainly should have felt that they should have been published. I certainly,equally, would not have published them in those circumstances without discussing the matter with Colonel Lohan first.Q. With him as representing the committee? A. With him as representingthe committee, yes.Q. You see, if I may say so, in your second article in the Spectator, on &apos; D&apos;notices, you stated a principle there with the words &quot; Of far greater importance,however, is the question of the decision to publish itself &quot;. That leaves me in doubt as to whether the &apos; D&apos; notice system could survive if each editor thoughtthose principles were workable for the future, because it leaves those who getthe notices under the system on what I will call the confidential basis reallyfree to make up their own minds what public use they make of them on aparticular occasion. A. This is the case with many documents. I do believethat a system of voluntary censorship is desirable, but I do believe equallythat as much as possible in a free society should be known about the nature ofthis censorship, and if the nature of the censorship can &quot;be made known withoutitself involving any breach of security, then I think it is desirable that it shouldbe made known.Q. That would be the reason for it, but it would leave you free, if you thoughtit right, to publish any particular &apos; D &apos; notice? A. Yes. Obviously there aretwo questions here, what should be done and also the terms on which onereceives something. If I make a bargain to receive it on the understanding thatit will not be published, then I do not publish it, but if you are asking me what1 think ought to happen, I believe that any &apos; D &apos; notice which does not itselfcontain secret information, information which to publish would be a breach of security, then I think these should be published when they are issued.Q. I think a view which has been taken by a great many people concernedwith this system over the years is that all &apos; D&apos; notices have some security aspectin them, in that they on the issue do two things: they warn the people who receive them of certain points of anxiety, which is the Governments cause forasking for them to be issued. That is thought to be in itself to some extenta security pointer. Secondly, I believe nobody has ever found a way of wordinga &apos; D&apos; notice, except the very simplest sort, which does not to some extent give
Q. Then, Mr. Lawson, have you ever heard of a &apos; D &apos; notice being printed byany editor before? A. (Mr. Lawson): No.Q. Did you realise that they were circulated on the private and confidentialor secret basis? A. I realised that when they were circulated in the normal wayto newspapers, as part of the system, part of the understanding was that these would not be published by the newspapers concerned. As I said, I was underthe impression that we were not part of the system, and that since Alan Watkinshad been shown these things in the office of the Secretary, and had copied them out openly and in front of him, and there was no possible question of anysubterfuge, the question of whether we published them or not depended on two things, it seemed to me, as an editorial judgment.

If I make a bargain to receive it on the understanding thatit will not be published, then I do not publish it, but if you are asking me what i think ought to happen, I believe that any &apos; D &apos; notice which does not itselfcontain secret information, information which to publish would be a breach of security, then I think these should be published when they are issued.Q. I think a view which has been taken by a great many people concernedwith this system over the years is that all &apos; D&apos; notices have some security aspectin them, in that they on the issue do two things: they warn the people who receive them of certain points of anxiety, which is the Government^ cause forasking for them to be issued. That is thought to be in itself to some extenta security pointer. Secondly, I believe nobody has ever found a way of wordinga &apos; D&apos; notice, except the very simplest sort, which does not to some extent give
away information which is of security import. Those are the reasons for sayingthere is always the security element about a &apos; D &apos; notice. A. My own judgment,which is certainly fallible, is that these particular &apos; D &apos; notices did not give awayanything, and could not conceivably be said in any situation to have involved a breach of security. They were extremely general, and I should have thought theonly possible case which could be made for suggesting that anything positivewas conveyed by them which might involve a breach of security was I thinkparagraph 2 of the second notice, which Mr. Watkins referred to in his article,and this did not seem to me to involve a breach of security, because in the firstplace it is really all in a section of the Official Secrets Act 1920, which itself is not a secret document, and secondly, of course, more recently it was published by the Daily Express. But the main thing is that it is all in the Official Secrets Act1920, section 4.Q. The power to intervene is there ; its implementation of course is another matter. But that principle, of judging for yourself whether there is any validsecurity interest involved in publishing a &apos; D &apos; notice, would leave every editor,who received these documents on a confidential basis, free to make his owndecisions as to whether or when to publish? A. If you receive it on a con-fidential basis, then there is the question obviously of an understanding betweenthe editor and the committee, and if he agrees not to publish it then he agreesnot to publish, and that is that.   I had had no communication Q. I was really asking you about the workings of the thing in the future, on your principle. A. In the future I would say that a possible solution might befor those &apos; D &apos; notices which can be published to be published when they are issued by the committee, and not by any individual paper. But of course thequestion of editorial judgment on matters of security arises all the time ; editorshave to decide, in their knowledge of the Official Secrets Act and other things,whether to publish such and such a piece of information will or will not be a breach of security, and indeed the purpose of this committee is partly to assisteditors in the exercise of this judgment. ^Q. I quite agree with this, but if you have this voluntary system, and the &apos; D&apos;notice has been approved by the committee which has a major Press repre-sentation on it and there is an understanding that it is private and confidential and circulated under that system, I follow your point that the committee might say: &quot; We will not approve this unless there is an announcement of its terms &quot;,but supposing they do not say that, would you be prepared in the future to observe secrecy with regard to the &apos; D &apos; notices, if you receive them, unless thecommittee took that line? A. I do not think the Press is the sort of bodywhere representatives of the Press can have a complete mandate for the wholePress and every editor. An individual editor would certainly take very seriouslyany agreement which was made by a number of people who included repre-sentatives of the Press, but he would not feel irretrievably bound by that. Yousee, one of the things one has to bear in mind is that on the whole newspapersdo not like their readers to know that they are accepting any kind of censorship ;they like to give the impression of being bold, fearless and free, so they may wellwant to keep this fact quiet that there is this system of censorship, and certainlyit was kept very quiet for a very long period of time, presumably with Presscollusion. But it does not necessarily follow that it is in the public interest thatthe existence of this system of censorship should not be known. So, answeringyour question, I think certainly one takes full account of the agreement which isentered into by the Press representatives on the committee, but one cannot feeltotally and irretrievably bound by this.Q. I am not quite sure whether there are not two points in that answer: one is whether you would feel irretrievably bound, if a &apos; D &apos; notice is issued by theauthority of the committee, to observe it. You say there may be a situationwhen some great public interest would prevent your observing it. But the otherpoint, a much simpler one, is whether, if under this system in which they are treated as private and confidential you get the notices, you would not be contentnot to publish the notices? That is a much smaller matter, and relates to the effective working of the voluntary system. A. Yes.  As you say, it is a much
smaller matter, and I would have thought that for that reason it should not prejudice the working of the voluntary system, that the voluntary system canwork whether or not these are published. The voluntary system works on thebasis that these notices are respected, unless there are very very compelling reasonsin the editor&apos;s mind for going against them, and as you say the question of publication does not affect that. I do not think the question of publication should in any way destroy the working of the &apos; D &apos; notice system. If any &apos; D&apos;notices are to be published and it is an open question whether they should bepublished when they are issued on the authority of the committee or whether thisshould be left to the discretion of individual editors, and if it is left to the discretion of individual editors then I agree this should be done only when thereare positive reasons for publication, and it seemed to me that the issue which arose in the case of these two &apos; D&apos; notices did produce clearly in the publicinterest a reason for publishing, so that the public could judge on this issue.Q. I had rather hoped understanding that when you published these youthought you were not part of the system, but the situation is different now that you would agree that &apos; D &apos; notices were inherently not things which in them-selves should be made public. You do not feel you could commit yourself onthat? A. What I feel I can commit myself to is what I said before, that had Ibelieved we were part of the system I should certainly not have published withoutdiscussing first certainly with the secretary of the committee, and also with thecommittee.Q. That goes some way, but I very much doubt quite frankly I am sayingthis in confidence whether Government departments would commit themselvesto the contents of a &apos; D&apos; notice at all if they thought that those notices werenot going to be treated as confidential and kept from publication. That might,perhaps needlessly, prejudice a system which you said before was on the whbleuseful. A. Yes. Well, I would certainly hope that the system would not be jeopardised by this. It would seem to me that it would depend on the natureof the publication. Certainly if any publication involves a breach of security,then this clearly cannot be countenanced, but there has been a lot of secrecyover a long period of years because it was thought essential to the system, and agreat deal of this was blown away by the 1962 report. I do not think this did anyharm at all. I think that if you are going to have censorship in a free society and I agree that there are forces of circumstance which make it necessary nevertheless as much as possible should be known about this censorship.Q. I do not know that I want to controvert that as a general principle. Ireally was obviously hoping for more than you are prepared to concede aboutthe operation of the system as it exists. One alternative would be to say thatyou do not feel you can really participate in the way that the committee think isthe right way to participate that is, not publishing &apos; D&apos; notices therefore youdo not want to have them, and you take the risks, such as they are, of the official secrets Act. I do not suppose these particular problems often come across the path of the Spectator! A. No. We do not even have a full-time defencecorrespondent, which is again one of the reasons why I thought we might not be part of the system. Yes, certainly if the secretary of the committee were to say to me, speaking on behalf of the committee: &quot;Either you receive these, in which case you must give an undertaking that you do not publish, or else you willnot receive them at all and you take your chance with the Official Secrets Act&quot;,then he is perfectly entitled to give me that choice, and I have to choose one orthe other, and obviously if I chose to receive them on the strict understandingthat I would not publish them then on a point of honour I would obviously haveto accept this.Q. Yes. That may be as far on this question as we can get today. Supposingthe committee did give you that alternative, in the terms that I have been suggest-ing, would you be able, after thinking it over, to give us your answer? A. Iwould certainly be happy to think it over, and subsequently let you know what i would choose. I think I would like to think about this further before giving an answer.
Mr. Shinwell: You are of course aware of the procedure, the procedure whichhas been in operation over a period of years, undertaken by the Press and broadcasting Committee? A. I am aware at second hand, as I explained toLord Radcliffe, yes.   I have never been part of this system personally.Q. But you have now been made aware of it? A. Yes.Q. Within your knowledge has the procedure proved satisfactory, effective,no complaints about it? A. I honestly do not feel that I am competent to judgeon that. My impression and I can only say it as an impression is that therehave been occasions when the system has been used in a way which to my mind is not strictly within the terms of reference of the system, but as I sayI do not speak from direct experience, and I think probably I am not the rightperson to assist you on this point.Q. Would you be surprised to learn that most of the newspaper editors whohave been asked about this agree that the system on the whole has provedeffective? A. Oh, on the whole, if you ask me on the whole, yes, I think thisis what I would expect the verdict to be.Q. Then if a system has generally proved effective, what benefit is it to thepublic to disclose the &apos; D &apos; notice? A. I tried to explain why we did this, bothin the Spectator and in my answers to the Chairman a moment ago. I did not feel and do not feel that what we did killed or jeopardised the &apos; D&apos; notice system.Q. But is that not taking rather the negative view? What is the positive advantage to the public? I gathered that your answers to the Chairman seemedto indicate that the issue concerned the public interest, the public benefit. Thenwhat advantage accrues to the public disclosure of the &apos; D &apos; notice? A. If youwill forgive me for repeating what I said earlier, there seemed to me to be ageneral point and a particular point: the general point is that while one accepts the need for a system of voluntary censorship, it is in the public interest thatas much as possible should be known about that system, provided it does not involve any breach of security. The second and more particular point is thatthe precise wording of the &apos; D &apos; notices had become an important political issue.This had been raised in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister, who made an accusation, in answer to a question which was not about the wording of the&apos; D &apos; notices, stating that the Daily Express had contravened two &apos; D&apos; notices,and this suddenly became an issue. It had never been an issue before, and theonly way in which the public could possibly judge on this issue was for themto be able to read the &apos; D &apos; notices concerned, and make up their own mindswhether or not the Express had contravened the &apos; D &apos; notices.Q. Do I understand your concern, after the Prime Ministers answer to thequestion, in the House, was to defend the Express! A. So far from its being to defend the Express, the result of the piece we wrote in the Spectator was apiece in the Express attacking us.  The Express was not at all happy with it.Q. In reply to the Chairman you indicated that there might be occasions when,speaking for yourself as an editor, you would not be bound by a decision ofthe committee, even if the &apos; D&apos; notice was regarded as valid? A. I think thisis, as I understand it, how the &apos; D&apos; notice system does work, that any editormust in the ultimate resort reserve the right to publish a piece of information ifhe thinks it is in the public interest to do so, even if a &apos; D&apos; notice has beenissued warning him off it.Q. But if an editor claims that privilege, it is open to all the editors to do thesame, do you not agree? A. Yes.Q. Then does that not make the whole system ineffective? A. No, I think thewhole system is based on trust, therefore you have got to trust the editors notto do this except on rare and compelling occasions. This has been done, therehave been occasions when in spite of a &apos;D&apos; notice a newspaper has publishedsomething which was covered by a &apos; D &apos; notice, and the system has survived.Q. Well, I repeat the question: if an editor . . . and you do not claim theright for yourself, you claim the right for all editors obviously?-A. most certainly.
Q. If editors disregard a &apos; D&apos; notice, and feel themselves in no way bound tocomply with the provisions of the &apos; D &apos; notice, even if it impinges on our security, then what is the purpose of the &apos;D &apos; notice system? It relies on trust,it is a voluntary system, it relies on goodwill and co-operation, but if that isvitiated in some form, and presumably by all editors or a number of them,what is the purpose of the system? A. Can I put it the other way: either itis a voluntary system or it is a compulsory system. You cannot have it bothways; you cannot say it is a voluntary system which is compulsorily binding on all editors. I think it is an open question as to what sort of censorshipis the more desirable, bearing in mind the needs of security and the need for a free society and a free Press. In this country we have decided, I think rightly,that a voluntary system is preferable. There are of course the Official secrets act and so on in the background, but we have decided that a voluntary system is preferable. If you do opt for this system, then I think you must accept this as inherent in the voluntary nature.Q. In your experience, can you recall any newspapers publishing the &apos; D&apos;notices in the form in which they were published in the Spectator! A. Notpublishing the &apos; D&apos; notices, no, but a more serious thing, a bigger thing, as LordRadcliffe pointed out: publishing information which a &apos; D&apos; notice specificallyrequested them not to publish.Q. But if it is not customary, in fact it is most unusual and unlikely thateditors would publish the &apos; D &apos; notices, why did you publish them? A. I amsorry, I did try and explain that earlier. I do not think I have anything to add to the explanation I gave earlier.Q. That you did so in the public interest? A. Yes.Q. Were you concerned about invasion of privacy, or anything of that sort? A. No, it was nothing to do with invasion of privacy.Q. Then what did you mean by the public interest? A. I mean in the interestsof a free and open society.Q. You are concerned of course about security ; you agree that it is necessaryto protect the public by adopting security measures from time to time? A. most certainly. As I say, it did not seem to me that the publication of the contents of these two notices involved any breach of security.Q. Then you convey to the public the existence of &apos; D&apos; notices, withoutdetails. Does that not create some suspicion in the minds of the public thatthere is something wrong, without full information? A. The existence of &apos; D &apos;notices was revealed pretty fully earlier, in the 1962 Report of the Committeeof Enquiry into Security Procedures in the Public Service.Q. But they have not been published in the Press until this occasion? Thatis correct.Q. Had you any other motive in publishing them? A. No, no other motiveat all.Q. You were concerned about the Prime Ministers attitude in the House ofCommons, of course? A. I was concerned about this particular issue, yes.Q. And that was probably one reason why you published them? A. If weare talking now in terms of the political field, I would say that there is really a wider issue, and that is that it does seem to me that one of the problems atthe present time is that under the present Constitution which we do have inthis country, the power of the executive this is not an original point, I donot claim any originality, but this seems to me incontrovertible the power of theexecutive has become terrifyingly strong, and that there are many ways in whichthe executive is able to expand its powers, without any proper check orbalance and I believe one of the necessary checks and balances is the Press,and the publication in the Press of facts and reports and documents whichenable the public to check the validity of what it is that the executive is doingor saying ....
Q. Although agreeing with you a hundred per cent, about the growing powerof the executive I am very much interested in this topic would you not alsoagree that a government is bound from time to time to adopt measures in orderto safeguard the interests of the public, without disclosing details? A. I hopethat the Government is wholly occupied in safeguarding the interests of thepublic, and not just from time to time. But I feel that this was a very strangeoccasion. I still do not understand to this day why it was that the Prime Minister,in answer to this question of how many &apos; D&apos; notices had been published, made this accusation about the Express. I do not understand it, it seems to havebeen quite unnecessary, and certainly I cannot see how this as it happens was inthe public interest.Q. If the Prime Minister had not made the statement in the House, you wouldnot have been concerned about the &apos; D&apos; notices and about publication? A.(Mr. Watkins): Can I come in here? No, it would not have been germane tomy article, which was on Mr. Wilson and the Press. It was Mr. Wilson as itwere who brought up the question of &apos; D&apos; notices and the Daily Express in thefirst place.  There would have been no occasion to do it if he had not said that.Q. You are familiar with the procedure of the Press and Broadcasting Com-mittee and the &apos; D&apos; notice system? A. Only what I have read, particularly inthe 1962 report.Q. So it amounts to this, that if it had not been for the statement by thePrime Minister, you would not have bothered about this at all?-A. Oh no.Q. You would not? A. No. I certainly would not I do not know whether we are a cross purposes here, but I would not have been writing the article.Q. But I understand from what Mr. Lawson has said and no doubt you agree that your opinion is that &apos; D &apos; notices should be published from time totime? A. If it is in the public interest that they should be published.Q. But you never would have done so if it had not been for the statement bythe Prime Minister? That was the reason you decided to publish them? A. the accusation that the Daily Express had broken two &apos; D &apos; notices, and I took theview, as political correspondent, that the &apos; D &apos; notices ought to be set out so that people could see. This had become a matter of acute political controversy. (Mr. Lawson): I think one can take it a stage earlier, that had this accusationnot been made about these two specific &apos; D&apos; notices, Alan Watkins would never have gone to Colonel Lohan and said : &quot; Please can I see these twonotices? &quot;, and there would not have been an issue.-(Mr. Watkins): I thinkit is a philosophical point you are raising, Mr. Shinwell: if it had not been for the chain of events, I would not have been writing the article.Q. I am not accused by the Press of having any knowledge of philosophy,so I must not answer that. When it was decided to appoint this committee,what view did you take of it? Did you think it was unnecessary to have thiscommittee of inquiry?- A. (Mr. Lawson): No, I think we felt that there wasneed for some sort of inquiry.Q. Do you think, in the circumstances, that the Government acted wiselyin appointing this tribunal? A. Yes, I am sure it did.Q. And Mr. Watkins, you agree? A. (Mr. Watkins): I am really being asked my opinion, am I not?   I would rather not give it, honestly.Q. You expressed an opinion in your article, did you not? A. Oh yes, butI think it might be better if I did not express an opinion as to the usefulness ofthis committee.Q. May I quote your article? A. Yes do.Mr. Shinwell: &quot; It may be that the committee composed of Lord Radcliffe,Mr. Emanuel Shinwell and Mr. Selwyn Lloyd-an unlikely and slightly hilarioustrio-will justify the Express.&quot;Chairman: Well, Mr. Watkins has written it, and he does not want to enlargeon it.Mr. Shinwell: Can you explain what you meant by that? A. No, no.   Ithink it is a perfectly lucid sentence, if I may say so.
Q. What do you mean by hilarious? Be quite open about it, it is all right,you will not get into trouble about it, we shall not sue you for libel. A. No,but I think it would be better if we did not go into these matters-but, theCommittee was, I thought, an unlikely conjunction of individuals.Q. Was that term &quot; hilarious &quot; just associated with your general view about this, you were just having fun and games, you were not really concerned aboutthe &apos; D &apos; notice publication, were you?-A. Yes I was, of course I was.Mr. Shinwell: Thank you.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Mr. Lawson, looking to the future, you did say youaccepted the need for a system of voluntary censorship. Because it is voluntary,the sanction therefore is consent, and when one comes to the question of thepublic interest the editor has the right to disregard the &apos; D &apos; notice, that really isthe ultimate sanction? A. (Mr. Lawson): Yes and then he takes his chance,obviously, with the Act.Q. Do you think it is unreasonable that the committee, on which there aresixteen people, eleven from the Press and five from Defence departments, should communicate on a private and confidential basis? A. I think it is certainlyperfectly reasonable that they should communicate on a private and confidentialbasis as the normal routine, because obviously a lot of what they are concerned about is highly confidential. I believe however that there are occasions when it isin the public interest to shed a little light on parts of this.Q. But is it not going to make the work of the committee very difficult, if itsends out a private and confidential letter knowing that the recipient is goingto decide for himself whether or not to treat it as private and confidential? A. I think it might well be the case, as I say, that the committee would want tosay to an editor: &quot; There is a choice before you: either you receive these, inwhich case you must clearly understand that they are not to be published, or else you do not receive them at all, and if you get hold of them in any other way and you publish them this is a different matter &quot;, and I think Lord Radcliffeasked me to ponder on this and give a reply.Q. It would be a great pity, would it not in fact would it not be verydamaging to the voluntary system? if you did get, say, a dozen editors outof the number who receive them, saying: &quot;We contract out of the system&quot;?Would that not in fact wreck the system? A. Contracting out of the thingtotally?Q. If they say: &quot; We take our chance under the Official Secrets Act, we do not want to receive these notices &quot;. A. If a dozen editors were going to do this,then obviously the system would be very considerably reduced in effectiveness.It is not my impression that this is very likely, because most papers are broadlysatisfied with the system as it is. Of course, we are in a slightly different position from many other papers, because we do not have a full-time defence correspon-dent; we are not constantly faced with the problem of whether a bit of defencenews should be published we are not even in the news business, strictly speaking should we publish it, or should we not. I can see the problem with the daily news-papers, having to make quick decisions all the time about whether somethingshould be published or not, but we are in a different position, therefore it does not seem to me that it follows that if we were to take one view about the &apos; D&apos; notice system, whether we want to be in it or not, then the Fleet Street daily paperswould automatically take the same position. I do not think it would follow,although I agree that if everybody did follow this then the whole thing wouldbreak down. I would also sa3&apos;, if I may, that the situation at the moment as Iunderstand it and I think certainly it is how it should be is that the editordoes reserve in the ultimate instance the right to publish something, even if therehas been a &apos; D&apos; notice requesting him not to do so, and it seems to me that much the same might well apply to the question of publication, that he mightreserve the right to publish ultimately on much the same ground if he reallyfeels that this is in the public interest. And what had happened was that a verypeculiar thing had arisen, in my knowledge unprecedented, about these two &apos; D &apos;notices.
Q. Yes. I am not concerned with the past, I am merely looking to the future.It seems to me that a body of this sort is going to be put in a serious difficultyif it cannot communicate on a private and confidential basis with all the recipientsof these notices. A. I think it must communicate on a private and confidentialbasis, but it does not seem to me to follow from this either that every singlejournal in the country should be part of the system, and it does not seem to meto follow from this that there will not be instances when an editor I do not want to commit myself on this might feel that the public interest was over-poweringly in favour of publication of a particular notice. Again, this could begot round in other ways. As I say, there could be as it were two classes of notice: there could be some notices which, because of their nature, can bepublished as they are promulgated, and others which cannot. From the factthat a large number of communications of the committee must be of a private and confidential nature, it does not necessarily follow that eveiy single com-munication must be on a private and confidential basis, because after all theexistence of the committee now is well known.Q. That is on a slightly different point; that is if the committee decides to publish, which it might, of course. But what about the other weeklies? Ifyou were to decide that you would contract out of the system, who do you thinkwould follow your example? Would the other weeklies all do it? Do theyhave defence correspondents? A. The Economist has a defence corre-correspondent; the New Statesman does not really have a defence correspondent,they have an academic who writes on defence from time to time but he is not apractical working journalist in any sense. I cannot tell you, I am afraid, whatdecision other editors would make. I have not even committed myself to whatdecision we would make.Q. No. I am really putting these questions for consideration, and so that you may possibly be thinking them over when you come to make your decision. Itwould seem to me possible that it might become an example followed by others,and that quite inadvertently in trying to preserve your own freedom of actionyou might be wrecking the whole system. A. I do not believe this is so. As I say, I think we are in a different position from the daily newspapers and Sundaynewspapers.Q. I am accepting that you have the right of course to disregard them, butthat right is really the preservation of the national interest in the broadest sense,rather than the right to publish a private and confidential document. I take it that you would accept that you should not publish a private and confidentialdocument, and that if you feel you want freedom to do that you should contract out of the system? A. I think clearly if one accepts a system on a plainlyunderstood private and confidential basis, that is one thing and one adheres toit; on the other hand, it could be that the confidentiality of the documents wason the same basis as the advice in the documents, in other words that therewas a request, with the same authority, not to publish them. (Mr. Watkins):May I just interpose here, because I want to clear up an answer which I gave toLord Radcliffe earlier. I think it is necessary to distinguish two senses of private and confidential document: one case it seems to me is where one has entered intoa system or into a relationship with the person who gives you the document; theother case is where the document has &quot; Private and confidential&quot; stamped upon it, or indeed &quot; Secret&quot;, or indeed &quot; Top Secret&quot;, and the classification which theoriginator of the document chooses to put on it, whether confidential, privateor whatever, should not I think necessarily inhibit a journalist or an editor,although of course he will take account of it.Chairman: Of course, I accept your distinction, but I was thinking aboutthe first of the classes which you referred to, in which the terms of dealingwith the possession of the document are clearly set out. Thank you very much,we are much obliged to you both. You will think over your position on thepoint I have put to you? A. (Mr. Lawson): Yes, I shall(The witnesses withdrew)
Evidence of Mr. L. J. DickerChairman: We are grateful to you for coming. Would you make plain exactlyyour capacity? A. I am at the moment the only representative of the newspaper proprietors&apos; Association on the Services Press and Broadcasting Committee. i cannot say that I am giving you the views of the N.P.A. because they have not met and briefed me, but I am here with their knowledge, consent and approval to speak as the N.P.A. representative on this committee. That is the position,and I believe I am the senior member of the committee except for one of thetechnical members.   I am the senior newspaper member.Q. For how long have you been a member of the committee? A. Since 1955.Q. So you have had a long experience of it? A. Yes indeed.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: May I ask why were you the representative? You werechosen, were you? A. Yes, you are nominated by the body you represent, inmy case the N.P.A., and there is the Newspaper Society, the Guild of Editorsand so on, and the broadcasting services.Chairman: Once you have been chosen and have passed on to membership of the committee you have not got contact with your appointing body; you acton your own responsibility? A. Yes. Just occasionally I have rung them up and said, &quot; We have this little problem, and I propose to do so-and-so&quot;,and that is how it has gone.Q. We gather the full committee only meets about once a year? A. It meetswhen necessary.Q. I appreciate that. A. We always try to meet at least once a year to havea look at each other anyway.Q. We have been told that there is, as it were, an emergency procedure. Onbehalf of the committee the secretary approaches as many as three newspaperpeople with an emergency government request for meeting together, and theyeither approve or disapprove of it.   Have you been involved in that? A. Yes.Q. Does it work? A. It works quite well, yes. You must of course realise,as I shall tell you presently, that some requests for &apos; D &apos; notices do not get asfar as us because the secretary, who knows the form, will say to a service department, &quot; There is no point in putting this forward, they will never wear it.&quot;That is why we probably have not issued any in the last six months, or thelast six months of last year. When the question was asked in the House, how many &apos; D &apos; notices have been issued in the last six months, the answer was none,and none for the previous year. There might have been a supplementaryquestion as to how many &apos; D &apos; notices were requested and not granted. there might also have been a supplementary question as to how many private and confidential letters were asked for. Apart from &apos; D &apos; notices there is also theprivate and confidential letter procedure.Q. How would you describe that with your experience? How is it distinguished from the &apos; D&apos; notice? A. The private and confidential letter frequently draws attention to the contents of a &apos; D&apos; notice, but it can also invite Editors, without going as far as a &apos; D &apos; notice, to do or not do certain things. One that has worked very well is the private and confidential letter on the question of. . . .Although the private and confidential letter has not got the same weight as a &apos; Dnotice, this one in particular has worked very successfully.Q. How does it differ from a &apos; D &apos; notice?   Does it not go through the Pressrepresentatives? A. It does.Q. How does it differ? A. Very little really.   One is inclined to bracket themtogether as far as the office is concerned.Q. It is not a thing which emanates purely from a Government source withoutthe Press representatives on the committee being asked? A. No.Q. So it has to have some Press weight behind it, as does the &apos; D &apos; notice? A.Yes, I imagine they could issue a private and confidential letter without going through the full committee procedure, but as far as I know they always have.
Q. Anyone is entitled to ask an Editor if he would mind not publishing A or B,but what we call a private and confidential letter emanates from the secretaryof the Press and Broadcasting Committee? A. Yes.Q. But it is not issued without the Press representatives being consulted first? A. It comes with our approval.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: All of them? A. I do not know one that has not. It maybe letters have been written to Editors privately, but that is quite another thing.Chairman: But that does not use the machinery or the name of the Com-mittea? A. No.Q. Then I do not see the distinction. A. There is very little distinction actually,but it is just that the one appears to have more weight than the other. If yousaw a &apos;D&apos; notice there and a private and confidential letter there you wouldprobably say the &apos; D &apos; notice was the more important document.Q. They both go on the same file in the Editor&apos;s office I imagine? A. Yes.Q. And both are one might say uniformly observed? A. Yes.Q. Although there are inadvertent breaches? A. Yes, very few I am glad to say.Q. You have had twelve years&apos; experience. Have you known of a deliberatebreach of anything which has gone out under the Committee&apos;s name? A. No,I have never known a deliberate breach. The only one I remember, and I am afraid I was not connected with this because I was on holiday abroad at thetime although it concerned my own paper, was that there had been a defectorand we had news of this and raised it with I think Colonel Lohan, or whoeverwas acting for him at the time. It was referred back to the Service Departmentsconcerned and a &apos; D &apos; notice was issued asking the papers not to mention thismatter, which of course gave away our exclusive and was a little unfair inthat the department concerned could have told us in advance, told all the news-papers, that there had been this defection and they wanted it kept quiet for acertain time while he was questioned. It was issuing a &apos; D &apos; notice from hindsight,and I believe the Daily Telegraph published it. Otherwise the only breaches i know of have been quite inadvertent. It is rather difficult of course for every-body people who are on duty at all hours of the day on a newspaper to bemade aware of &apos; D&apos; notices. You have to keep &apos; D &apos; notices under a certainamount of security, and it is not always possible to do that and make themavailable to those who are on duty at 3 o&apos;clock in the morning.Q. Obviously. I appreciate everybody regards the defector incident as being a special one, but is it possible to apply a principle that, because one paper has got a story which I will assume affects security in a material way, therecannot be a general &apos; D &apos; notice issued about it? A. If I may, sir, I wouldlike to bring this out in the context because it does affect our procedure a littleand it has some bearing on the case which gave rise to this tribunal being set up.I do not want you to think I am shooting a line, but on&apos;&apos; a previous occasionsome reference was made to the stature of members of the Committee. I wouldlike to point out that, while I am not an Editor, as indeed some of our members are, I have had a certain amount of security responsibility, in that I served inthe Royal Artillery during the war and was trained in what was then secretequipment such as radar, aircraft plotting, proximity fuses and so on. I was responsible for the issue of the recognition signals for aircraft and later onalso for the destruction of them by fire when they were in use. At the requestof the Newspaper Proprietors Wartime Emergency Committee just before D-day was transferred to Press communications in the north-west German campaign and attended many top secret briefings and worked in close liaison with thefield Press censors and field security services. My appointment to this Com-mittee was on the recommendation of the late Lord Burnham who was a bigfigure in the N.P.A. and managing director of the Daily Telegraph, and whohad been during the war director of public relations at the War Office. Soperhaps I have a little advantage of knowing something of both sides of the counter. I have in reply to your question mentioned the question of private and confidential letters and do emphasise that they have been very effective,
particularly the one about ... and that is admitted by the services side. Therehave been moves to turn the private and confidential letter into a &apos; D&apos; notice,but nobody appears to have agreed on the wording. As it is going very well atthe moment I think we ought to let well alone.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: How long has the . . . one been going on? A. For ayear or two. The Press side of the Services Press and Broadcasting committee may have told you this, but I would like to make it clear from the N.P.A.point of view they adopt these standards for agreeing to the issue of a &apos; D&apos;notice: the security of the Realm and the Commonwealth; the protection of life,usually servicemen&apos;s lives but not always ; compromising the work of the security services. The examples of this in the security of the Realm are withholding such information as the existence of certain installations ; the protection of life; even this ... notice, . . . and their lives would be in tremendous jeopardy. Alsothe Petrovs, the Russians who defected in Australia ; they are still under securityso far as their place of residence goes because we are assured by the security services that Iron Curtain vengeance goes so far that their lives would be worthnothing if it were known where they now are. So as to avoid compromising thework of the security services we have a &apos; D&apos; notice making secret the addressof M.I.5, the identification of agents and certain security methods.Q. Pausing on that one, as you say, you have outstanding &apos; D&apos; notices whichcover probably a good deal of it, but is it very difficult for your committee toget enough information about security service operations to be able to issue a\D&apos; notice about it? Do you find that you do not get the kind of backgroundinformation on that subject that you need? A. Yes, so far we have never seen mr. X.Q. You may be denied that. A. But we hope in future that we shall. Thatis another point I am coming to in a moment. But I would like to emphasisethis. We do not agree to &apos; D &apos; notices, and I think we never shall, for suchreasons as saving Ministers or Departments from awkward questions. We allrealise that awkward questions can be raised in the House, and so on, and maybe reported in the Press. That we cannot help, and whatever party is in power the same applies. We are sometimes asked to suppress troop movements andwe have made it clear we can hardly be expected to do that unless the services can say that full field security is applied, by which I mean such things as thewartime method of sealing the troops after briefing. This was discussed at ameeting of the committee and I asked if this were possible ; I was told thatit is not in peacetime. I said that there was nothing to prevent troops goingout of camp after being briefed and using the public telephone to ring up their wives, sisters, mothers, brothers, sweethearts and telling them where they were going, and they said, &quot; I suppose there is not.&quot; In that case nothing that wecan do will keep troop movements secret. Some of the &apos; D &apos; notices already inexistence one rather questions. . . .Q. It was accepted in the first place? A. Yes, that was before my time.Mr. Shinwell: Who conveys these suggestions to you? How are they conveyed to you? A. Which suggestions?Q. . . . How do you get to know about it? Does somebody come to you?-A. Yes, normally a &apos; D&apos; notice starts with a Service Department asking for thisparticular &apos; D &apos; notice to be issued.Q. Does it come from a Service Department or does it come from the secretaryof the committee? A. It would come to us from the secretary of the com-mittee, but it would have been put to him by one of the Service Departments.If the War Office wants a &apos; D &apos; notice it would presumably go through theMinister of Defence, who will pass it on to the secretary of the committee,and if he thought it was worth while coming to us he would bring it to us.Q. Could you be a little more explicit and explain the channel of communica-tion?   There is a secretary of the Press and Broadcasting Committee? A. Yes.Q. At one time it was Admiral Thompson, now it is Colonel Lohan? A. Yes.Q. Do the Service Departments convey the request to Colonel Lohan in thefirst instance, and then does he convey it to your committee? Is that how it is done? A. That is how it is done.
Q. Does it come direct from the Service Department or any other depart-ment? A. It comes direct from the Service Department to the committee, but it ffigftgoes through the secretary of the committee. Now we are coming to the point which caused this tribunal to be set up: the methods used in counter-espionage.It must be quite obvious that at times there is scrutiny of cables and telegrams,a watch on ports, telephone tapping and so on ; everybody knows that certainprecautions have to be taken against spying, otherwise he gets away with it andgoes on for some time without being caught, as we have known from courtcases in the past. It must be obvious to everybody there is a watch on seaportsand airports, and it must be obvious that cables are being scrutinised. We comedown to the &apos; D&apos; notice about no mention being made of counter-espionagemethods. I think it can only be held to apply to particular cases, and I do not know what the basis of Mr. Chapman Pincher&apos;s report was. I do know he isa very experienced journalist. I do not know whether in fact scrutiny of com-mercial cables has been stepped up, but if you want my opinion, I will say that anything that happened there was a very technical breach of security, if in factit was a breach at all.Chairman: Just what are you saying that your reading of the &apos; D&apos; noticesin question makes you at any rate doubt very much whether they apply to thearticle, is that it? A. Yes, could I put it this way, sir, that we have askednewspapers not to say anything that gives away our counter-espionage methods.I do not think it is giving them away to say a port is being watched for anabsconding diplomat, or that some sort of scrutiny must be made of outgoingcommunications. It is an obvious thing to do if you have a security service atall, and one would think one was not getting very much for one&apos;s money ifthey did not do it.Q. You would not oppose the first instance you gave, would you, that of a port being watched, because that would be a direct tip-off to the intendingabsconder? The second one I follow. A. The absconder would have sufficientsense to think he probably would be watched. We have all travelled by sea;we have seen men looking at passports and consulting a list of people he wants to meet, and then saying, &quot; Off you go &quot;.Q. You mean simply stating that there is a regular service through which everyoutgoing traveller has to pass is rather a different thing? A. What I would consider to be a breach of a &apos; D &apos; notice is this. If one reads one&apos;s James Bondone knows every agent carries a Smith Wesson in a shoulder holster ; if youchanged the weapon that might be a breach of security. We all imagined in ourboyhood that MI.5 used invisible ink, which is giving nothing away, but if yougave the formula that is being used for the invisible ink you would help the enemyby telling him how to detect it more easily if you see the distinction I amtrying to make?Q. I am sure there is a distinction there. You think a general statement thatthere is a scrutiny of all outgoing or incoming cables does not fall within thatconception? A. I would not think it is telling the enemy anything he does not know. Put yourself in the position of an agent in this country getting a messageout he would be very wary of sending it by cable.Q. It might be important to know how comprehensive and regular the scrutinywas? A. Yes, I would expect that any cablegram that gave any cause at all forsuspicion or one that seemed to fall into a pattern would naturally be referred tothe security services.Q. That raises the question of how you would detect a pattern. A. Yes, ifyou find a man is ordering 50 cwt. of potatoes from London today, fromSouthampton on the second day and from Hull the third day you would think there was something fishy going on.Mr. Shinwell: A Service Department, including the authority who presides,declares that this is a very important matter, there must be no disclosure of any sort or kind. Does the Press then act as a judge in a matter of that sort anddisregard the opinion of the department? A. Are you suggesting they are now,through the &apos; D &apos; notice procedure?
Q. You seem to be saying there are instances where in your opinion there isno reason for secrecy at all is not that what you are saying? A. In somecases I do say that.Q. Who is to be the judge?-A. If it is a question of the &apos; D&apos; notice com-mittee advising the Press not to use something, they must first of all be put inpossession of all the information, and not merely told &quot; This is important.&quot; Weshould be given the whole story. That is another point I have in my notes to bring up before you. Sometimes of course one cannot help technically breaking a&apos; D&apos; notice. ... It is a question of interpreting these things in the best possible way, having regard to the circumstances of the moment. I would like to em-phasise that newspapers try to be as loyal as most, and we would not willinglydo anything to compromise the security of the Realm, or any of the other things which are the basis of issuing a &apos; D &apos; notice. I just want to digress for a mount about the question of when a newspaper seeks advice from Colonel Lohan it usually starts with Colonel Lohan on a story which may be said to conflict with a &apos; D &apos; notice. I think you may agree that this can hardly be referred to theServices Press and Broadcasting Committee members, because one would be putin the position of having to pass judgment on another paper&apos;s story. That is notfair to the journalist concerned and is not fair to us. I would not like to sit inthe office during the evening knowing that the Daily Express first edition was coming out with a story which we would probably like to have, and this might easily happen.Chairman: I follow that, that you can be brought into it as far as drawing upa &apos; D &apos; notice is concerned, but after that if there are questions of interpretationthe Press representatives must be left out of it? A. Yes.Q. What follows from that? A. In that case I think on the question of oneindividual story it has got to be between Colonel Lohan and the journalist orthe editor concerned. I have had some experience of something rather like thisjust after the war, when the Control Commission took over in Germany. It was announced by one of the Control Commission senior officers that if they actedon behalf of any individual journalist the information they got would be availableto all. This of course caused the most almighty storm in which I got involved,because I was asked to preside over meetings between the two sides. Therewas I, with senior officers on one side and war correspondents on the other,trying to sort things out. The Control Commission eventually had to drop it andthey agreed to respect a paper&apos;s &quot; exclusive&quot;, as I think Colonel Lohan andthe committee have here. I would rather not know about what another paper is going to publish, and I am sure other editors would think that too. I am prepared always to give my opinion as to whether a &apos; D&apos; notice should be puton a particular matter, but I do not think any member of this committee shouldbe asked to judge whether a particular story and they would have to know what it was was conflicting with a &apos; D &apos; notice. This is only my own thoughtsand does not represent anyone else&apos;s opinion, nor that of any of my colleagues to whom I have not mentioned it.Q. What follows then? There is the secretary with a question arising about a story which a newspaper has got which he may think is within the &apos; D&apos; notice ;the newspaper may entirely genuinely think it is not. What happens? A. Theonly thing they can do is to have direct dealings between Colonel Lohan andthe newspaper and, if it is necessary, bring one of the service departments in,but it must be between him and the newspaper.Q. But what is his position? He cannot make a ruling and say &quot; I declarethis is, despite what you say, within a &apos; D&apos; notice &quot;? A. No, that is what I was coming to. I was hoping to put up something which is my own opinion,something for you to kick around, and that is that it might be necessary to havea referee or umpire. I was thinking of someone like Frank Milton, the Londonmagistrate, with his legal brain on one side and his military experience on theother. He was once my instructor on military law, and such a good one that25 years later I remember it all. To him perhaps might be supplied copiesof &apos; D &apos; notices, and in cases like this he, or someone like him, could be askedto rule: Does it, or does it not, come under the &apos; D &apos; notice?
Q. I follow that. He has to be on the job very quickly ; it would only be aquestion of a few hours possibly. A. Minutes, sir.Q. Would the Press side accept some impartial referee?-A. That is a thingon which I have consulted no one ; it is merely an idea in my own mind whichI thought you gentlemen might like to kick around.Q. It has two basic elements ; first of all the Press would have to agree to respect such a decision which would mean you would have to find someonewho is sufficiently knowledgeable and experienced for the Press to respect his decision, and secondly he would have to undertake to be almost constantlyavailable. A. It would require those two prerequisites, yes. We had originallymeetings with the committee, and one of the things posed is that one memberfrom the Press side should be recognised as vice-chairman of the whole com-mittee, which is now as you know chaired by the Permanent Under-Secretary,and that he should be positively vetted so that all relevant information on anycrisis could be given to him with confidence. Since part of your brief is toconsider how procedure could be improved, I think this should apply to thewhole committee. It is necessary to consult more than one person, and people are often away on holiday. These things do crop up sometimes when one isaway, and I do not think anybody should be on this committee who has notthe full confidence of the security services so that at any time they can be given full information on which to make a judgment.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Would the Press accept that, that they should all bepositively vetted? A. I should imagine so. I should imagine on the quietwe have been vetted already I should be surprised if we were not.Chairman: Do you think the Press would be content that somebody theyhave nominated to serve on the committee should be told he could not servebecause, for reasons which probably could not be given to him, the peopleresponsible for the check had decided against him? A. I would have thoughtit would be better to turf him out before any damage was done.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Would the Press accept it?Mr. Shinwell: I am trying to connect this with something you said previously.You said that the committee must be satisfied on the information that is furnished to them that there is a case for secrecy? A. Yes.Q. Suppose the government department says, &quot; We are very sorry, we cannotdisclose the information ; it is highly important, highly secret and we cannotdisclose it.&quot; What do you do then? A. That is rather a poser, sir. I am looking at it this way, that this committee by issuing a &apos; D&apos; notice is probably silencingall the London papers and all the provincial papers amounting to 2,000 organsin the country, and before that we have to be sure we are on the right lines.I do hope that the people on this committee could be trusted with the information.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: If they came and said to you, &quot;At such-and-such placethere is very secret mechanism, we have no intention of telling you what it is,what its purpose is or how it is constructed; we tell you there is this very secretthing, do not mention it.&quot; Would you take that? A. No, I should say &quot; Whatis it; what is this secret installation? &quot;Chairman: It would be very difficult to issue a &apos; D &apos; notice about it in termsunless you know. The danger of a &apos; D &apos; notice always is that it must carry acertain amount of information. A. The wording sometimes does not conveyvery much, but they could admittedly put an enemy agent on the right track.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: If they said &quot; connected with radar&quot;, would that be enough? A. I would not think radar was secret.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: A new type of radar.Mr. Shinwell: What you are asking for is that information should be con-veyed to members of this committee who would be positively vetted, whateverthat means at the end of the day, which is not conveyed even to members of
the Cabinet.-rA. I do not know what information is conveyed to members ofthe Cabinet.Mr. Shinwell: You can take it from me there are some items which relate to security that are not even conveyed to every member of the Cabinet. why should this information be conveyed to this committee?Chairman: I think Mr. Dicker&apos;s difficulty is that he is asked to put the weightof his authority as a pressman behind keeping something out of the news thatotherwise would be in it, and he does not feel he can do that unless he isgiven a good reason for doing it.Mr. Shinwell: Lord Radcliffe, you recall that a statement was made by aneditor that no editor, no individual editor, can feel bound by any decision ofthe committee. What would you say to that? A. No, the only thing I can say to that, sir, is that of course if the position got out of hand you would haveto have recourse to the Official Secrets Act.Chairman: You would have to redraft it first! But this is your difficulty, isit not, that a mere I do not want to beg the question by the use of the word&quot; mere &quot; a declaration by some eminent civil servant that something is frightfullyimportant but that it is equally important in the public interest that it should notbe published, is not enough for your committee to accept unless you are given at any rate acceptable reasons? A. Yes, we would like to know I suppose it comes to this that we are acting in the national interest and not in any political interest. The reason it is desired not to mention it may be a question of cost,I do not know, but if I can have even the slightest glimmer of information thatwe have some revolutionary weapon we do not want the other side to get toknow about, all right, I will give my backing to any &apos; D&apos; notice. I oftenwonder if we find the ultimate deterrent whether we will announce it or keep itsecret.Q----Chairman: This arose out of something which I do not want to leave, theidea of a vice-chairman drawn from the Press side. -A. Yes, the suggestioncame from the official side.Q. What are you going to do with him if he is not going to pass judgment on emergency questions as between the secretary and one newspaper? can be  intervene? You say a pressman cannot be expected to. A. I think theservices side think what I have suggested, that there should be someone on our side to whom they can speak with the utmost confidence and franknessQ. Speak to him for what purpose? A. On the question of the issue of a&apos; D &apos; notice.Q. He would not have the guarantee of his fellow members? A. No. Itwas suggested at the same meeting that someone should have the power to judgeon the issue of a &apos; D&apos; notice or not. The consensus- of opinion was on our side of the committee that it would not work.Q. You did suggest a referee, did you not? A. Yes.Q. But the referee would not be a member of the committee? A. No.Q. What your people felt would not work was one member of the com-mittee? A. One or more, yes.Mr. Shinwell: The referee might be told part of the story by someone repre-senting the government, and that part of the story would be told to the com-mittee and they would not accept it; they would want the whole story. Do youunderstand that to be the position? A. Yes, as I say it is not really a suggestion,merely an idea that passed through my mind, the question of a referee. As alawyer, you will know various Acts of Parliament and can give an opinion asto whether one has been broken or not. The referee would have copies of&apos;D&apos; notices, that is all he would have, and a certain story would be submittedto him, and he would say, &quot; That clearly conflicts with &apos; D &apos; notice so-and-so.&quot;I am not suggesting he should have any more information than that. He wouldbe an expert on &apos; D &apos; notices in the same way as a lawyer knows the law.
Mr. Shinwell: It would relate solely to the impending publication of a story?- ^A. Yes, Sir. &apos;     %Q. And the referee would be asked to pass judgment on whether that was a story that was related to the &apos; D &apos; notice? A. Yes.Chairman: Do you think he could do it without knowing the past work ofthe system and the understandings that had arisen over a period as to whereit would seem to be straightforward and rather comprehensive? A. I supposehe will have to know something about case law as well.Chairman: It looks like one of the possible difficulties over this April, 1956,&apos; D &apos; notice, that although it might read to a person coming to it for the first time as being very comprehensive, in fact it has not been applied that way andpossibly cannot be.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: Could he say there was a prima facie case and the storywas not to be printed for 24 hours? A. This, as I say, is not the view of theN.P.A., it is not the view of my colleagues, just an idea which passed throughmy mind to get over this difficulty. Going back to the question of a member ofthe committee judging, supposing Chapman Pincher writes another story next week and it is shown to me; I may say no, it cannot be used, and it might be suggested I am just stopping the Express getting the story because we have not got it.Chairman: You might get it in the meantime.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: I do not see how you could get your referee. These thingsmight happen sometimes with the first edition and the man would have to beon duty permanently. A. You have the case of Colonel Lohan who is a man who is on duty 24 hours a day 52 weeks of the year ; he must be.Chairman: He is at any rate providing a service, but the referee is the man who is only there just for the crisis and he is to be turned on like a tap. A.Rather like the office legal consultants. When you have a sticky story you sendit to them at 9 o&apos;clock, 10 o&apos;clock or 11 o&apos;clock at night and they have to give aspot judgment.Mr. Shinwell: This is not a criticism, but how does he manage to cope without an assistant of almost equal status? A. The answer apparently is that he nevergoes away.Q. Where does the chairman of this Press and Broadcasting Committee come in? When does he function? A. As far as first-hand evidence goes he presidesover the committee meetings. I imagine he is frequently consulted by colonel lohan, and I imagine he is probably consulted by the Service Departments at times. As far as my own observation goes I only see hinf at committee meetingsor if we meet socially.Q. If there was any matter in dispute could it be referred to the chairman ofthe committee? A. He is on the official side, is he not?Q. But he is a person of some authority? A. Yes, but at the same time he does represent the side which is trying for the &apos; D&apos; notice as against the sidewhich may be resisting.Q. All that you have been saying amounts to this in my view, that the pro-cedure that has been in operation in this committee for many years is unsatis-factory. A. I have said quite the opposite, Sir. I think the committee has been operating pretty satisfactorily. We have had very few breaches. In my twelve years I can only remember about three what might be called rows, and I thinkaltogether we have done a pretty good job.Q. Would you go so far as to say that throughout the period when you havebeen operating on this committee you have always been able to get the infor-mation you wanted from Service Departments or government departments whichsatisfied you that there was a case? A. No, not always, sir.
4  Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: If you did not get it there was not a &apos; D &apos; notice? A. Wefhad to be pretty satisfied that there were reasonable grounds. I have forgottenwhat the last &apos; D&apos; notice is now this private and confidential letter on . . .What they did there was to invite us along to the Ministry of Defence and wewere given what the services now call a presentation in which gentlemen spokeand pictures were projected, maps and so on, and there was a notice, &quot; Thispresentation is secret&quot;. We were told precisely what would be entailed . . .We were put completely in the picture.Chairman: You had an adequate background on information? A. Yes.Mr. Shinwell: You have just said in reply to the previous question that youdid not always get the information you wanted and yet you complied with therequest of the secretary of the committee. A. I am going back some years now.What I had in mind particularly was when we had a little inquest on thisdefector. We were not addressed by the security services president, we only hada second-hand kind of briefing, and we made the point then and there that we wanted to see Mr. X himself, although we may not be able to recognise him thenext time we meet.Q. Is not that asking a lot? You want to see Mr. X, whoever Mr. X may be.If any government department decides Mr. X is not available, you insist onseeing him? A. When I say Mr. X I mean the representative of the^ security service himself as such and not someone who is acting as his mouthpiece. Inother words, if MI.5 wants to talk to us let us have somebody from MI.5 andnot be told what MI.5 thinks by somebody at the Admiralty.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd: But you never have had anyone from MI.5? A. Yes, I did, preceding ones. When I arranged several &apos; D &apos; notices some people agreedthem and others did not on the question of the Petrovs. One MI.5 man didcome along.Q. To the committee? A. No, he actually talked to a sub-committee of thecommittee.Chairman: Putting it from another angle, over the years you could notdescribe this system as completely watertight, could you? A. No, it is notwatertight.Q. Do you think by its inherent nature it cannot be made watertight?-A. Wehave not got the power to compel a newspaper not to publish something. Itmay be the editor goes against it and if it is considered an extremely seriousbreach I suppose proceedings would be taken, but we cannot say to an editor,&quot; You must not use it.&quot; I might have originated the &apos; D &apos; notice but my editorcould still decide to go against it. I do not think he would, but he could andhe might.Q. I realise the nature and the powers, but in practice what has happenedis that it has very rarely been challenged by any editor? A. Very rarely.Q- And you can only recollect one case, which I think was rather a specialincident? A. Yes.Q. Otherwise it does not secure that there are not breaches, because theycan arise inadvertently and without people realising it, and in fact do, butthey do not destroy the general impression that it is working effectively. A. No,we do not want to whitewash ourselves. In this committee where we were askedabout things we came to the conclusion that we all said we thought it had worked very satisfactorily. I am only trying to provide one or two positiveideas for you to kick around, because part of your terms of reference is: Canit be improved?Q. Yes. I was only asking and I was rather putting the answers myself whether to look for an improvement that makes it absolutely watertight may beunreal. A. Yes, I do not think you could make it absolutely watertight, because we are not empowerea to issue a final directive. The &apos; D&apos; notices say &quot; Youare asked in the national interest to avoid so-and-so&quot;, and most people areloyal citizens and do that. Might I enquire if this Tribunal is taking any noticeof the question of the publication of &apos; D &apos; notices?
Q. Well, when you came in you may have seen. . . . A. Unofficially I know!the last witness was Mr. Watkins. *Q. What do you want to say? A. All I want to say is that the security of&apos; D &apos; notices is a thing which is very close to our hearts, and we do not wantthem made available to all and sundry. One of the points we made at the last meeting was the distribution of &apos; D &apos; notices would require to be by hand, ifpossible officer to officer, because although the Press Association through thegood offices of its editor is willing to run a &apos; D&apos; notice over the teleprinter toassist in an emergency, too many people see the tape, it has been seen by too many people before it gets to the editor.Q. Using the PA. tape, which obviously goes into all sorts of offices, it isnot possible for this means of distribution to be confidential. A. No, peoplesuch as the Daily Worker and the Tass Agency anyone can see it.Q. Really these are messages that should be brought to the eye of the editordirect, and PA. tape is very far from achieving that? A. Yes, and use of the double envelope system would be a safeguard, marked Private, Confidential orSecret.Q. Why does your committee feel it essential that the &apos; D &apos; notices should notbe a matter for publication? Tell me the reason. A. The reason is that a&apos; D&apos; notice can lead a clever agent into certain directions of enquiry. They aremade as watertight as possible, but you cannot avoid giving some clue as towhat is going on.Q. Yes, there is always a security element in a &apos; D&apos; notice. A. Oh yes.The Press Association tape of course we will have to fall back on if it is aquestion of getting something out in a matter of minutes ; but otherwise the whithall system of fast motor cycle, or whatever it is, is the thing which oughtto be used.Q. But then you all know that, the secretary knows it. A. Oh yes, andthat is what he is doing, just as when he has to consult two or three membersof the committee about something he sees them physically. If there is a questionof doing much ringing up I suggest members of the committee should be provided with scrambler &apos;phones.Q. But it is much better in an emergency that they should meet together? A.Yes, but if it is a question of minutes one has to move quickly. But there maybe quite a case for putting the members of the committee on the scramblersystem. The reason I mentioned the Spectator I only know one side of it isthat it did seem to us when it was mentioned at the last meeting that it was aquestion that required investigation. I was in favour of throwing it to the PressCouncil, but it was agreed that since it appeared this committee would be takingcognisance of it we should hold on until you have made your report.Q. Anyway, the views of your committee are that it, would be inimical to theidea of the system that &apos; D &apos; notices themselves should be given publicity ; is thatright? A. Yes. Incidentally, there is a question of security involved here, becausethe Spectator published a statement that it had not a file of &apos; D &apos; notices. Iunderstand Colonel Lohan has. . . .Q. I think we are informed about these things. I only wanted to know what the attitude of your committee was. A. We do feel here that the honour of our secretary is at stake, and I think we must be expected to protect oursecretary.Q. Yes. Are there any other points? A. No, I think I have said all I wanted to say, sir. If there are any points you would like me to answer I would be only too pleased to do so.Q. I think I have put to you the ones that were troubling me. I do notthink I have anything else to ask you. Thank you very much, Mr. Dicker ; Iam obliged to you. A. Thank you for a very patient hearing.(The witness withdrew)
