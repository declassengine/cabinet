I think that the Cabinet will be interested to seethe attached Report Sir Richard has made to me.D. P. T. J.Board of Trade, S. W. 1,1st June, 1967
president the KENNEDY ROUNDMinisters may like to have, as a supplement to the brief reportthat I made on my return from Geneva, which was circulated undercover oi EN(E)(67) 14, some account of the proceedings which led tothe agreement reached on 15th May.GeneralThe last five days were devoted to the completion of bilateral negotiations between the principal participants and to multilateraldiscussion of those problems which affected all or the majority ofthem.   As the time passed the issues narrowed and sharpened until&quot;by the last day we were left with a small number of extremely difficult problems affecting chiefly the Community, the Americans, theJapanese and ourselves.   These were discussed in ever smallergroups until by the last day only six individuals were concerned -the leaders of the four delegations, Mr, Wyndham white and his deputy.By the time we reached this stage we had already agreed to stop theclock;   we were due to finish by midnight Sunday the 14th May, and weoverran by 23i hours.It had been clear throughout the last stages of the negotiationthat, the chief difficulties lay between the Americans and the Community.In the end these reached the point of being no longer capable ofdiscussion between them and it was apparent to all of us thatMr. Wyndhan white would have to intervene by &quot;taking the initiative in proposing solutions which none of the negotiators could themselves have advanced and which were equally unpalatable to all of them,  sothat no one could say that he had been singled out for particularlyharsh treatment.   After some faltering of touch in the earlier stagesMr. Yfyndham White rose to the occasion and carried through the businessof the last day with great coolness, courage and skill.CerealsBefore briefly recounting the history of these events, I shouldcomment on the negotiations for a cereals agreement, which unexpectedlyproved easier than had been expected.(D
The abandonment by the Americans of their proposal to fix self-sufficiency ratios for the importing countries made matters a gooddeal simpler, though it put the importers in a more vulnerablenegotiating position on price and food aid.On price, we had authority to settle for a maximum of $1.97for the highest grade of Canadian hard wheat.   When I returned toG-eneva it seemed clear that Mr. Wyndham Y/hite had decided to deferany discussion of the cereals price to the very last moment andthen to bulldoze the importers into accepting whatever figure the exporters would be prepared to settle for.   As this seemed likelyto give us a poor bargain I   insisted on a discussion of the cerealsprice on Friday night.   The experts began a meeting at 11.00 p.m.that evening.   At 1.40 a.m. I was called from bed, as also wasAmbassador Roth, to try to resolve the impasse which had by then been reached.   The exporters, with Canada, very much in the lead, wereinsisting on a minimum of 02, while the importers had not gone above$1.88, though they had informally suggested splitting the differenceand settling for $1.94*     This was rejected outright.   The exportersthen asked for a quarter of an hour&apos;s recess, which was prolongedto one hour and a half while they argued axiong themselves.   When they came back they said that as a great concession to the importers andas positively their last word they would settle for $i.97, which wasthe upper limit to which I had been authorised to go.   An ill-timedintervention by the Argentine, who suggested that the exporters&apos;figure was fair because it split the difference between the 02 forwhich the exporters had been pressing and the $1.94 which the ijiiportershad informally mentioned gave me an opportunity of sowing dissensionamong the exporters by offering to settle at $1.95i&quot;, thus magnanimouslysplitting the difference between $1.97 and $1.94.   The exportersrefused to accept this on the spot and we broke up without agreement at.30 a.m.   When we met again at 12 noon we found a disposition tosettle on the part of all the exporters except Canada.   I refused todiscuss the matter direct with the Canadians, saying that the exportersmust take their own decisions;   I knew by this time that the Argentines,the Australians and the Americans would all settle for our figure andthat the Community would also agree with it.   The Canadians were thuscornered and obliged to give way, which enabled us to settle for 1-g- centsbelow our maximum figure.(2)
On the food aid programme we settled for 4&quot;2 million tons a year,which was the maximum figure for which we had authority, hut were ableto avoid American proposals for a programme rising by half a million tons a year.   We were at one time threatened with a proposal that theBritish share of the cost should be increased from 5 per cent to3j per cent, but we were in the end able to escape this.Bilateral AgreementsWe were negotiating bilaterally with the Community, the americans and the Japanese,   All our discussions were tough but friendly.   all three countries said that we were much the most difficult of theirnegotiating partners, but it was noticeable that we completed our negotiations with them before they finished theirs with each otheror with third countries.   The level of reduction of industrial tariffswas unexpectedly high (37 per cent reciprocally with the Community,33 per cent with the United States and 33 per cent with the Japanese);this was because in the event all countries preferred to add to theiroffers rather than to hegin a process of withdrawals which nighthave undermined the whole basis of the negotiation.   With theJapanese we did better than expected;    this was because the Japanese had sheltered behind us in the cereals negotiations and we were abletp exploit their debt to us in this sector by extracting greaterconcessions from them in the bilateral negotiation than we would otherwise have been able to do.An incidental effect of the negotiation will be a substantialsimplification of the British tariff by the elimination of some700 of the present 3^000 headings.   This will be an advantage to theCustoms as well as to British importers and foreign exporters.The AmericansThere was a flurry on Saturday and Sunday because of approachesfrom the American Secretary of State to the Foreign Secretary and fromthe American Embassy to the Prime Minister&apos;s office.   The impressiongiven by the representations which they made was that it was theattitude of the British which was most likely to wreck the negotiations.This was entirely unjustified, as the main issues were and alwayshad been between the Americans and the Community.   The -Americans in geneva were rather shamefaced when I told them what had happened;(3)
39 9it was clear that the State Department and the White House hadpicked out of an omnibus telegram sent by Ambassador Roth when hewas feeling at his gloomiest certain points relating to his negotiations with the British and had given the impression thatthese were the only problems on the horizon.   No doubt the Americanconcern was perfectly genuine and they were indeed fearful of a breakdown;   but it was something of an exaggeration to pick on theBritish for special representations.   As Ambassador Roth said tome &quot; I don&apos;t suppose that Dean Rusk has been telephoning to Couve&quot;,The Last day by Monday morning we were left with four problems;    concessions on agricultural products by the Community to the Americans, the chemical package,  steel, and food aid.   Mr. Wyndham White1s proposalsconcentrated on these by asking for concessions from all partieswhich could never have been secured by direct negotiations and were,as he put it, of equal brutality.   The Community were asked for concessions on a number of minor but highly sensitive agriculturalitems;   the Americans were asked to swallow a much smaller first instalment of the chemical package than they could ever have acceptedhad it been proposed by the Community;   we were asked to concedea 20 per cent cut on the specific tariffs on steel, for which therewas no justification as a bargain with the Community and which couldbe regarded only as a contribution towards a harnonisation of steeltariffs;   and the Japanese were asked to make the same contributionto the food aid programme as we had already agreed to make.   Theseproposals were presented at a meeting of the four principals at11.00 a.m. on 15th May.   Having cleared oy lines with the Minister of power, for whose understanding of the position in which we were placedI was extremely grateful, I thought it right to take the lead by accepting immediately the request made of the British.   The other threeall asked for time and we agreed to meet again at 5*00 p.m.   When weresumed the Americans, with suitably reluctant noises, accepted the chemical package.     The Japanese had not heard from Tokyo, and M. Roywas in extreme embarrassment,   He was threatened with a meeting ofthe Council of Ministers in Brussels the following day, which would at the least have delayed the settlement until Wednesday and at the worst might have wrecked the whole operation.   We all pressed himto avoid this if possible and to settle that day on the ground that the publicity caused by the news of a further Ministerial meeting in Brussels(4)
would have been disastrous.   He asked for ncre time, and we agreedto meet in private at Sir Eugene Melville&apos;s house at 10.00 p,i.When we had all gathered, somewhat later than the appointed hour,H. key said that there would be no Ministerial Council;   he hadbeen in touch with the Americans and had worked out an agreementwith them on the agricultural items.   The Japanese Minister(they alone had a Minister as their principal negotiator in theselast days) said that he could agree to the financial contributionto the food aid programme, but that there were still questions tobe settled about the form of the contribution.     This was goodenough for the Americans, and we agreed that the essential elements of a Kennedy Round settlement had been decided.   We thereuponopened the champagne which Sir Eugene had thoughtfully put uponthe ice and after drinking our own health and that of the kennedy round we departed for GATT headquarters where at about 11.30 p.m.Mr. Wyndham White announced the settlement to the assembled multitude.It was received with acclaim by all, including the representativesof the less developed countries, and we departed to meet the press and retire to bed.AftermathThough the elements of a settlement are agreed there is a vastmass of detailed work to be done before the full results of the negotiation can be recorded.   The record will have to take intoaccount the outcome of all the bilateral negotiations.   All countries have been asked to report to the GATT Secretariat by 31st May the concessions which they have made;   these will then be compiled ina Protocol Agreement which is to be ready by 17th June and will be formally signed in G-eneva on 30th June, when the President of theUnited States will be signifying his approval in Washington of the detailed changes in the United States tariff.It will then be necessary for the United States to proposelegislation abolishing the American Selling Price system applicableto Benzenoid Chemicals;    only when Congressional authority for thishas been obtained will the second part of the chemical package beactivated.   In addition to the direct results of our bilateral negotiations, we shall receive some side benefits from reductions inmfn tariffs negotiated between third countries.   These will raise stillhigher the total size of the reductions achieved.(5)
Some RejectionsThis was a unique negotiation;    it was far more elaborate and comprehensive than any previous attempt to reduce trade barriers andit seems most unlikely that there will ever be anything like it again.Given its immense complexity, it was managed with great skill byMr. Wyndham White and his colleagues of the G-ATT Secretariat.   it took a very long time to get under way,  since the Community worenot disposed to give their minds to it until they were finallyconvinced in the last weeks that the American deadline of 30th june was indeed a deadline and could not be extended.   The last two weekswere exceedingly strenuous.   The days and nights were completelytaken up with multilateral -and bilateral negotiations;   no-one evergot to bed until 2.00 a,m. and meetings frequently went on untilmuch later in the night.   Despite the strain, however, tempers were kept and the atmosphere was surprisingly good.   Though the negotiations were hard they were on the whole based on mutual trust (with some doubts from time to time of the motives of the Community).    the negotiators finished with feelings of respect and, indeed of friendshipfor one another.   When it came to doing business M. Rey showedhimself skilful and tenacious, with an ability in the end to take abroad view, and to decide when to risk exceeding his mandate.   TheJapanese kept as inconspicuous as possible despite the presence of a minister, and were clearly in no mood to embark upon any very boldmeasures of liberalisation.   The Americans suffered from errors of tactics and timing due chiefly to inexperience;    the defects of theAmerican Governmental system which prevents career officials fromrising to the most senior posts had never been so convincinglydemonstrated to my eyes before.   Despite the handicaps from whichhe suffered, including a rather brash and insensitive deputy,Ambassador Roth proved a good colleague capable of rising above pettydetail and of shrugging off the inevitable irritations and frustrationswhich he had to endure in ample measure, particularly from theCommunity,It was particularly interesting to watch M. Rey fighting on twofronts.   Not only had he to pursue the Community&apos;s Interests in his negotiations with third parties.;   he also had to fight a continuousaction with Brussels in order to secure from the Permanent representatives and the Ministerial Council the concessions without which we could never have successfully concluded, and in Geneva the Commission&apos;s everymove was closely watched by the 111 Committee,   For every day that he(6)
spent in negotiating with other countries he must have spent atleast the equivalent in dealing with problems in Brussels.   Hisproblems were clearly complicated by his desire to do nothing toinjure his prospects of becoming the first President of the fusedExecutive, now that Dr. Hallstein had withdrawn his candidature.Nevertheless, he showed considerable courage in chancing his arm,but on the last day, with Ministers in all the Community capitalstelephoning him continuously about the agricultural concessions which he had been asked to make to the Americans, he was clearly a very worried man.It was a pity that M, Rey thought it necessary to criticisein Brussels the attitude of the British towards the Community, andthat this got into the Press and gave General de Gaulle one morestick with which to beat us.   In fact, we gave the Community no more trouble than they gave us or than was inevitable in a negotiation of this kind.   I believe that In order to extract the necessaryconcessions from the Council of Ministers he had to show that he wasfaced with serious difficulties.   He presumably thought it unwise toplace the responsibility for these on the Americans, since this wouldhave given undesirable opportunities to those within the Communitywho would have preferred the Kennedy Round to fail.   There wouldhave been no point In criticising the Japanese or any of the smallercountries, and we were thus the only victim conveniently to hand.   Iam sure that at no time did M. key seriously think that we were beingunreasonable or that \?e were deliberately following a policy of blindlysupporting the Americans;   we ended good friends, and the tributewhich I paid to him at the final session was genuinely meant and taken as such.   I see no reason to think that relations with theCommunity have suffered in any way.I should not like to end this account of a memorable experiencewithout paying the warmest possible tribute to all those members of theBritish team from all Departments, whether based in Geneva or travellingfrom London, who worked so tirelessly, so devotedly, and with suchconspicuous mastery of the multifarious details with which they had to contend.   The standard of professional competence that they showedwas remarked upon by all who had to deal with them and they were neverfaulted.(Signed)   RICHARD POWELL
