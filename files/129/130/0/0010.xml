hoCUMENT IS TH.E PROPERTY OF HEP. BRITANNIC MAJESTY TS GOVERNMENT)C(67) 90COPY NO.31st May, 1967CABINETMEDICAJL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY BliMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the FloraeDepartmentAt its meeting on 11th May (CC(67) 30th Conclusions, Minute 1)the Cabinet gave preliminary consideration to the question of findingGovernment time for this Private Member&apos;s Bill and agreed that thisshould be further considered by Legislation Committee,    TheCommittee met on 30th May and there was general agreement, theLord Privy Seal dissenting, that Government time should if necessary be found for the remaining stages of the Bill (LG(67) 15th Meeting.The latest print of the Bill is attached.2.       The Bill as introduced by Mr. David Steel had the objects ofclarifying, and giving statutory effect to, the existing case-law (whichpermits abortions on grounds of risk to the life or health of the expectantmother), and of introducing certain additional grounds for abortion,including the potential abnormality of the unborn child.    The Bill inthis form was approved on Second Reading by a majority of 223 to 29,although some who voted for the Bill made it clear that they hadreservations about how far the grounds for abortion should be enlarged,3.      In Committee, the Bill was altered on the initiative ofMr. Steel to permit abortions on grounds of risk of injury to thewell-being of the pregnant woman or the unborn child or the woman&apos;sother children.    This enlargement of the grounds for abortion liasattracted criticism because of the vagueness of the concept of &quot;injury to we 11-being&apos;&apos;, which would cover virtually any grounds for terminating the pregnancy.    Moreover the provision for destroying the foetus onthe grounds of risk of injury to its own well-being does not make sense.4.       I have been in touch, through Mr. Steel and Mr. Douglas Houghton,with the sponsors of the Bill, about the amendments which might bemade in it to make it acceptable.    I understand that they are now prepared to propose amendments of the Bill to drop the references to&quot;well-being&quot;, and that they will not press an earlier suggestion thatthe Bill should incorporate a World Health Organisation definition of&quot;health&quot; which defines it to include &quot;well-being&quot;.    If the Bill isamended as now proposed, it will provide for abortions on two groundsonly:-
B., H. J.Home Office, S,W.l.31st May, 1967-2-(1)     risk to the life of the pregnant v/oman or of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family;(2)    substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriouslyhandicapped.5.       The Bill will contain safeguards which are not in the existing law.A termination of pregnancy will be lawful only if both the operatingdoctor and another doctor are of the opinion, formed in good faith,that one of the grounds permitted by the Bill is satisfied;   the operationmay be performed only in a National Health Service hospital or in a place approved by the Minister of Health or the Secretary of State forScotland; and notice of the operation must be given to the chief medical officer of the Ministry of Health or the Scottish Home and HealthDepartment.    The Minister of Health and I are satisfied that, with thesesafeguards, the Bill, with the proposed amended grounds for abortion,and with other more technical amendments I have suggested to Mr. Steelwill be in a workable form.    We should not wish to advise the House toaccept amendments which propose to restrict in the wa^  suggested byMr. Brained amendment the qualifications of the doctors who mayperform abortions.6.      The arguments for and against abortion law reform, and thegrounds on which abortions should be statutorily permitted, have nowbeen very fully debated in both Houses and it would be most unfortunate if Parliament were now prevented, by shortness of time, from reaching decisions on Mr. SteeNs Bill.    We should then almost certainly have togo through the same trouble again next session.    It seems clear fromthe volume of amendments that the report stage of the Bill will not becompleted during Private Member&apos;s time on 2nd June, and thatGovernment time should be given to enable decisions to be reached,I invite the Cabinet to agree that we should, if necessary, make itclear that Government time will be found.
