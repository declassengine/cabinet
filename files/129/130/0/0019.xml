HOUSING- EXPENDITURE REVIEWReport by the Official Committee on HouaingBackground1.     Ministers have decided that civil public expenditure should be reviewed with the objective of reducing the total of basic programmes in1970/71, as forecast in the 1966 P.E.S.C. report, by between  200 and  300million.   Separate reviews are being made of each of the five largestcivil programmes, one of which is Housing.2.     The review is required to show alternative ways of achieving areduction of about l-^fo or an addition of about 5$ in 1970/71, with an appropriate progression for the years 1968/69 and 1969/70 and a projectionfor 1971/72, together with a text bringing out the policy implications ofthe possible changes.3.     It is intended that the review of housing expenditure should not be restricted solely to housing investment and subsidies but should alsoextend to &quot;Other Housing&quot;.   This permits the notional increase of 5% and reduction of 7^f0 to be applied to the total housing expenditure under allheads.   It must be recognised hoxrever that within this total there are threevery different kinds of expenditure.   Housing investment expenditurerepresents fixed investment in new houses by the public sector.   Theexpenditure classified under subsidies and improvements consists of grants which directly or indirectly affect private expenditure on housing.Expenditure falling under &quot;Other Housing&quot; is mainly mortgage lending.PART A;   ENGLAND AND wales   EXPOSITIONHousing Expenditure in 1970/714-*     Estimated housing expenditure (at 1967 prices) in 1970/71 on the basic programme is summarised in Table 1 below:/TABLE 13.

The progression shown for new towns for 1967and subsequent years is that of the 1966 Basic programme.   It makes no allowance for Milton Keynes or for the increased output in existing new towns.Includes 11,000 extra approvals authorised in April and July 1966; plus2,900 excess in local authority approvals counted against short-fall in new town approvals.Includes 5*000 extra approvals authorised in March 1967.Assumed.   No decision yet taken about the 1970 and 1971 programmes.4.
Annex A shows the authorised programme in terms of starts and completionsfor local authorities and new towns in England and Wales, together with the contribution expected from Government departments, housing societies, andpublic authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland.   The programme leads to 242,000 starts and 23?,000 completions in the United Kingdom in 1970.Standards6.     A committee under Sir Parker Morris set up by the Central HousingAdvisory Committee recommended that local authorities should build their houses to better standards, notably as regards space and heating.   TheCommittee&apos;s report (1) was commended to local authorities when it was firstpublished in I96I5 and the Housing White Paper (2) of November 1965 saidthat local authorities would normally be expected to incorporate in newdesigns the main spa.ce and heating standards recommended by Parker Morris,In the 1966 Public Expenditure Survey the Treasury ruled that, since the investment expenditure approved by Ministers during the 1965 survey made no provision for rising standards, all expenditure already incurred, or expected to be incurred, as a result of increased costs attributable to ahigher proportion of houses with Parker Morris standards should be excludedfrom the Basic total and classified as &quot;Additional&quot;, pending further specificexpenditure decisions by Ministers.   Accordingly the basic programme makes no provision for the substantial increases which have occurred since september 1964 in the proportion of houses in tenders approved with ParkerMorris standards or with garages or hardstandings.(2)   The Housing Programme 1965 to 1970Cmnd. 28385.
7,    Ministers have subsequently accepted as inevitable the resulting additional expenditure in 1966/67 and 1967/68 but no specific approval has been given to additional expenditure in subsequent years:   Annex B shows however that if thepresent trend towards higher standards continues, virtually all houses intenders approved in the last quarter of this year (1967) may be expected to incorporate all the standards which Parker Morris recommended.   While therefore we suggest (in paragraph 25) that Ministers may wish to consider the possibilityof obtaining small savings in 1970/71 on the minor (equipment and fittings)standards, we have assumed in this Report that Ministers will regard theadditional expenditure then on the main (space and heating) standards as inevitable.8.    It is estimated that the additional costs arising from the adoption of thefull Parker Morris standards, including a higher proportion of garages and hard-standings, would add about  58m. to the Basic total of expenditure in 1970/71.Housing Yardsticks9.    This additional cost will be partly offset by the introduction of costyardsticks which will set limits of cost for the new subsidies.   Many authorities,in   order to get within the yardsticks, will have to redesign schemes andeliminate those which are higher than Parker Morris standards.   It is estimatedthat the total saving achieved in 1970/71 should be of the order of  10-15m., andfor convenience we have taken the figure of  13 million.   The net additional cost(i.e. improved standards as offset by savings from the housing yardstick) istherefore estimated at about  45m. in 1970/71.Reservations10.   The Ministry of Housing and Local Government and the Welsh Office considerthat the assumptions on which basic programmes were costed are so unrealisticas to be defective.   For that reason they consider that, if the review is to heconducted on the lines that Ministers intend, the basic programme should heaugmented by  45 million to provide for expenditure on improved standards which,as a result of policies advocated by Ministers, will have almost universallyteen adopted by the end of 1967.     The Treasury accept that the Basicexpenditure estimates for 1970/71 which Ministers approved in 1965 should6.
now be regarded as unrealistic as a measure of the cost of the authorisedprogramme of public sector housebuilding in England and Wales.   This is because these estimates made no allowance for the substantial improvements in standards which have occurred both before and after the issue of the1965 Housing White Paper.   It is, however, in the Treas-ury&apos;s view for con-sideration by Ministers whether any addition should be made on that account to the approved Basic total, or whether other offsetting adjustments shouldbe made elsewhere on Housing expenditure.II. THE RANGE OF CHOICESThe basic programme11.   The basic programme figures (adjusted to 19&amp;7 prices) shown in the1966 P.E.S.C. report for 1970/71 reduced by l^fo or increased by 5% wouldbe:- m,Basic plus 5/5 937 (an increase of  45m.)- Basic 892Basic less l^fo 825 (a reduotirn of  67m.)12.   The improvements in standards (paragraph 6-8) are estimated to add 58m. to the Basic total; but this should be partly offset by the economiesresulting from the introduction of cost yardstioks (paragraph 9) to give anet addition of  45m.   An increase of 5?o ^  45m.) on the Basic total would therefore be just sufficient to provide for the improved standards withoutany change in the authorised programme of approvals,13.   If total expenditure is to be held to the Basic total it will benecessary to make, some change in existing policies to save  45 m. because,as we shall see, there is limited scope for effective action by 1970/71 on other aspects of Housing expenditure, a large part of the saving would haveto be achieved either by reducing the authorised programme of approvals, orby reductions in local authority advances for house purchase.Reduction in authorised programme of approvalsH.   The whole of the saving of  45n to keep within the Basic total could beobtained by reducing the programme of approvals from 170,500 in 1967 to167,500 in 1968 and subsequent years, instead of the steady increase providedfor in 1968 and 1969 in the present authorised programme of approvals.To obtain a saving of a further  67m (making  112 m. in all) to reduce expenditure to7^/o below the Basic total, it would be necessary to make  a much more drastic7.
reduction in the number of approvals.   Local authorities and new towns wouldhave to reduce their programmes in 1968 and in subsequent years by about20,000 below the level authorised for 1967 and by nearly 30,000 below thatauthorised for 1969*TABLE 2	Number	of approvals			Total Housing Expenditure (  million)			(Basic 4- jjo s Present Authorised)	Basic	Basic	Year	(Basic + jfo ^ Existing policies)	Basic	Basic -Wo	(1)	(2)	(3)		(4)	(5)	(6)N	170,500	170,500	170,500	1967/68	845	845	845r	173,500	167,500	151,000	1968/69	905	897	875T	181,000	167,500	151,000	1969/70	930	902	854to	180,000	167., 500	151,000	1970/71	937	892	825I	180,000	167,500	151,000	1971/72	957	905	837To reduce expenditure in 1968/69 to the level shown in column (6) would require an announcement by mid-1967 at the latest of a cut of 22,500 in the present authorised programme of approvals for 1968.   In the view of the HousingDepartments, a cut of this size could not be borne without a complete abandon-ment of the Government&apos;s housing objectives.   If the announcement were not made until the end of 1967* the savings would be delayed.   In practice the savings to be secured in 1968/69 would be reduced to some  15m. and those in 1969/70increased to about  90m.15*   Both the authorised and reduced programmes must be considered in relationto the United Kingdom target of 500,000 houses in 1970 and to the commitment that about half of this number will be provided by public authorities.   as annex A shows, the present authorised programme in England and Wales, together1with those for Scotland and Northern Ireland, is estimated to provide 242,000starts and 237,000 completions in the public sector in 1970.   A reduction inthe authorised programme in England and Wales, in order to limit total housing expenditure to the Basic total in 1970/71 or to a level of W&quot; below the
Basic total, would mean reducing the number of houses started and completed by-public authorities in the United Kingdom in 1970 (assuming no change in theScottish and Northern Ireland programmes) - tosStarts CompletionsBasic 229,000 229,000Basic minus l%?o 212,500 212,50016.   Output by the private sector is capable of rapid expansion but, given thepresent level of building, there can be no certainty that it will provide itshalf of the target in 1970.   It is most unlikely that the private sector wouldmake up the shortfall in the public sector if this were held to the levelimplied by &quot;Basic minus 7%fo&quot;.   Indeed in the opinion of the Housing Departments,any significant reduction in the present authorised programme would involveabandoning (or postponing) the 500,000 target.Housing needs in Great Britain17,   The Official Committee on Housing is in the process of examining the500,000 target both as regards needs and feasibility.   Its interim report(HG(o)(66)20-Final) said that there were no present grounds for supposing that,apart from a small reduction in the rate of new household formation, the assessment of needs, which was made in 1965 and which led to the decision toset a target of 500,000 houses in 1970, was not well founded.   The reportshowed that some 260,000 houses a year were needed in the period up to 1970 toprovide for the annual increase in newly formed households, other losses fromstock (e.g. as a result of road widening) and for the maximum programme ofslum clearance that could be achieved.   (There are about a million slums butthe rate of clearance is not expected to exceed 95,000 a year by 1970).   Theremainder of whatever houses are built will make a contribution towards meetinglocal shortages where these exist, providing a margin for mobility and for the replacement of old houses not worth improving.   A programme building up to500,000 in 1970 would give an average annual output during the six years1965-70 of 420,000.   Thus the average annual number which can contribute to meeting local shortages, providing mobility, etc. would be about 160,000 witha 500,000 programme.18.   It was estimated that in 1965 the number of houses required in GreatBritain to meet shortages and to provide a margin for mobility totalled 700,000.Thus an average of 120,000 houses a year would have to be built in the rightplaces to meet this need, if no net migration between areas of shortage andsurplus took place.   In fact because they cannot all be provided in the rightplaces the number of houses devoted to these purposes will be less than 120,000a year.   It can be argued that if the private sector builds up to 250,000houses a year, reductions in the public sector programme inEngland and Wales of up to 30,000 houses a year which is what is implied in9.
&quot;Basic minus ijffo&quot;, could in theory be made without detriment to slum clearance;or to the provision of extra houses for new households and for losses from stock;or to the reduction of local shortages.   On&apos; this view the main effect of any such reduction in the programme would be to diminish the scope for replacing olderhouses which are not worth improving.   However, it should be emphasised that even with a build-up to 500,000 houses, no appreciable impact will have betn made by1970 on the replacement of near slum and obsolescent housing widely distributed inall the main built up areas.   The extent to which it will be practicable to carryout the large scale replacement of obsolescent houses, except as part of aclearance programme, is still uncertain,19.   On the other hand this crude statistical assessment of housing needs in termsof numbers of houses and households ignores both the balance between the public and private sectors and the fact that in order to satisfy a need, the house hasto be of the right type, at the right price and of the right tenure.   The house-building programmes of public authorities are directed mainly towards slum clearance(66,400 slums were cleared in England and Wales in 1966, compared with 60,700 in1965, and the number is expected to rise to 75,000 in 1969) and to meetingshortages and relieving overcrowding in the big cities.   But public authoritiesare also the main providers of housing for old people (they completed 38,000 singlebedroom dwellings in 1966, almost all of   which will have been for old people) andof housing to let at rents which low income families can afford.   There areshortages of such housing in almost every large city.   Local authorities are themain - and indeed almost the sole - providers of rented housing which, when insufficient supply, greatly facilitates mobility of labour.   Any reduction in thepublic sector programme, -let alone a reduction of 30,000 a year, would obligeauthorities to choose which of these needs should be sacrificed.   In particularmany authorities,. if required to reduce their building programmes, might be reluctant-tant to go ahead with slum clearance if it meant they could no longer continue toprovide houses for overcrowded families or old people in housing need.   A reductionin the programme to save  112m in 1970/71 (&quot;Basic minus 7^&quot;) would mean limiting&quot;the local authority and new town programme to 150,000 approvals a year from 1968onwards (Table 2).   By way of illustrating the sort   of decisions that would haveb* be.taken, the following table sets out the needs for which the 1967 programmeef 170,000 houses will provide :10.COKNNOINTIAL

These 141 priority authorities in England, broadly those with the werst slums or shortages, have settled 3 year programmes totalling about 100,000 (98,000 in 19^7);   authorities building houses for the recep-tion ef overspill from the conurbations have settled programmes totalling about 10,000 for this purpose (11,000 in 19^7) irrespective of the housesthey wish to build for their own needs;   Welsh authorities, most of who mare in effect in the priority category, take up about 10,000 approvals eachyear;   while the new towns expect to approve about 10,000 in the current year.   Thus, even if the priority authorities and new towns made nc advance on their present rate of housebuilding, the first 136,000 of the 170,000houses in the 1967 programme in the programme are in effect pre-empted forpriority areas.   But in fact these priority areas are expecting to increase their programmes over the next few years;   and therefare if the total programme does not rise at the same time, the priority areas can only begiven bigger allocations by cutting back the non-priority areas.   but although the needs of these remaining authorities are relatively lessurgent, their requirments are by no means negligible. Some of them haveThere is some double-Counting in this figure since those housed in oldpeopless flatlets may oome for example from slums or from overcrowdedhousing;   any extra will go towards the relief of overcrowding andshortages.11.
wrtrroewtlALmany slums still uncleared (they include towns such as Wigan, Derby,Barnsley).   Thus a decision to reduce the authorised programme for 1969 bysome 30,000 (which would mean cutting the programme to 20,000 below the 1967level) would mean restrictions in the priority areas and in Wales, as well as very severe reductions in the non-priority areas:   it would not be possibleto stop building even in the non-priority areas because looal authorities havea statutory duty to clear slums.   A decision to keep within the Basic total would mean a small reduction below the present level, and also foregoing the rising public sector programme for which the authorised programme provides.
XMvWarvv oEss-&apos;BaaBTS I g^Hfia,Augmented basic programme21.   M.H.L.&amp;. and the Welsh Office do not consider that the Basic totalincreased by 5% or reduced by 7 2% represents a realistic range of options.In their view the Basic total should be augmented by  45m. to allow for theimprovement in standards, and for the economies expected from theintroduction of cost yardsticks, and consideration should also be given tothe implication of increasing this augmented total by 5%.   The totalexpenditure figures would be: m.Augmented basic plus 5% 984Augmented basic 937Augmented basic minus 7%?0 867With the basic programme augmented in this way it would be possible tocarry out the building programme already authorised (implying 237,000public sector completions in the U.K. in 1970).    If the augmented basicwere reduced by 7-5$ and it was decided to find the savings entirely by reducing the number of houses built, the authorised programme of approvalswould need to be reduced by some 10,000 in 1968 and 20,000 in 19^9implying about 225,000 U.K. completions in the public sector in 197$.An increase of 5% on the augmented basic programme would give an extra 47 million which would be almost enough to provide for the additional programme proposed for new towns and to increase public authority-completions in 1970 to 250,000, details of which are given in Annex C.22.   M.H.L.&amp;. and the Welsh Office consider that the new projects proposed for the new towns, (outlined in Annex C) should be approved as additions to the authorised programme,   Since the new towns build largely for apriority need, the relief of overcrowding in the conurbations, their programmes are no less important than those of the &quot;priority authorities&quot;,and therefore even if these new projects are not accepted as additional,,they would still be allowed to proceed at the expense of the non-priorityareas c13.

A decision to cut standards, even xf taken in the immediate future,would not result in significant saving in expenditure before 1970/71.   Thetime-lag between design and &quot;work done&quot; is such that about two years are needed after public announcement for much work to be redesigned.   This iscertainly the case with space and heating      .   Moreover, the case for building to Parker Morris standards is that we are building houses that have to last for sixty years.    Space and heating are fundamentals of the design of houses.   And in the Housing White Paper the Government are committed to the adoption of these two standards.retails of the standards  are given in Annex D.23.   If the augmented basic were increased by % in 1970/71, the authorised programme of approvals and total Housing expenditure would beincreased as shown in Table 3 :
15.confidential the implications of reducing these standards are givan in Annex D.25, A specific prohibition of the remaining standards for equipment and fittings^1&apos; (washbasin in the second W.C. of the larger family-houses and more generous provision of electric sockets cupboards andfcttSfietf fittings), if announced in the immediate future as itemsthat will not qualify for subsidy, might begin to affect schemes submitted forapproval in 1966$ and savings might be secured by 1970/71. , These items are relatively cheap and between them they account for only JCfo of the extra cost of adopting all six standards.   Most local authorities now regard these standa-rds as desirable and virtually all will have incorporated them in their designs by theend of this year.   To disallow them for subsidy would therefore not only beregarded as an undesirable lowering of standards, but many authorities might beexpected to go on providing the full standards, foregoing subsidy on this part ofthe cost.   It is impossible therefore to estimate what saving in capital investmenta decision to disallow these items would secure in 1970/71 , but it could hardlyexceed  10m even if the great majority of local authorities fell in with thelower standards.Garages N26.   In the year ending September 1966 lOfa of dwellings in tenders approved hadgarages (42$) or hardstandings . (28$).   We have assumed a 2$ increase in garagesand a 6$ increase in hardstandings in each of the two succeeding years; but that thereafter, because garages will not qualify for subsidy under the new Bill, theproportion will remain constant at about 85$.   Old people !s flatlets for exampledo not always need to be provided with either garages or hardstandings.   Since, theprovision of either garages or hardstandings for most new houses is a requirement of present planning policy,.; it would not bo possible tc prohibit their provision altogether.We consider that by insisting, whenever possible, on hardstandings in preference togarages it might be possible to halve the proportion with garages, producingsavings in capital investment of up to  511 by 1970/71.Exchequer Subsidies27.   Exchequer housing subsidies (excluding the mortgage option scheme and miscellaneous items) are rising from an estimated  85m in 1966/67 to  155m in1970/71; that is to say, they are expected almost to double in four years,The subsidies to local authorities are calculated on the differencem loan charges on loans raised to finance approved new housing
schemes calculated at rates representing the rate paid by local authoritiesgenerally and a rate of 1+fo.   These estimates are based on an assumedrepresentative borrowing rate for local authorities of G^fo and, ifinterest rates should fall, the estimates would also need to be reviseddownwards.   The new subsidies are paid at the same rate to authoritiesirrespective of the nature of their housing problem or of the state of their housing revenue aooount and rent levels.   Powers have been taken in theBill both to raise the 4$ interest rate to which the basic subsidy isgeared and also to pay different rates of subsidy to different authorities or classes of authority.   Meanwhile since the time-lag between approval cfa house for subsidy and the first payment of subsidy on that houseaverages some 27 months, it would not be possible to obtain very largesavings by 1970/71.   Moreover in order to obtain what savings are possibleit would be necessary to alter the rates within a few months of the enactment of the Housing Subsidies Bill.   We do not consider this wouldbe practicable and we conclude therefore that savings in subsidies couldnot be obtained by 1970/71.   The Housing White Paper published inNovember 1965 made it clear however that &quot;the whole question of housing finance      needs much deeper study than this G-cvernment has yet had timeto give it&quot;.   Work on this has already been put in hand, but could not produce a new system to affect expenditure on subsidies by 1970/71.Leans for house purchase28.   A decision to reduce local authority lending for house purchase couldbe achieved without legislation (by simply refusing loan sanction).   Upto  130 million could in theory be saved, which is more than enough to achieve the cut of 7l$ in the Basic total;   while a reduction in local authority lending       45m. a year would be sufficient to enablethe numbers of houses in the present authorised programme to be built to full Parker Morris standards.   A substantial reduction in local authoritylending vrould have serious effects on the private housing market if the-funds withdrawn were not replaced by increased lending by other institu-tions.   This is because local authority lending is biased towards the16.CONFIDENTIAL
secondhand market and, since the sale of a new house often depends on thesale of an older house, a reduction in secondhand sales may reduce newhousebuilding.   But except in so far as it does this, a reduction in local authority lending does not release physical   resources inthe same way as does a reduction in new housebuilding.   The totalof local authority lending rose sharply from  8^m    in 1962 to 220m. in 19655 the L.C.C,/g.L.C component rising from  3m. to 77m.   For 1967/68 the approved limit is  I30mc, and it has not proved easy to introduce a rationing system which would allocate this amount equitablybetween local authorities and would be acceptable both to the G.L.C. andto other authorities,29*   We do aot consider it would be practicable to achieve savings of 112 million (l^fo below the Basic total) by this means.

30.   We have considered whether it would be possible to achieve somesavings in local authority lending in 1968/69.   This is however the year in v/hich a substantial recovery in private housebuilding vri.ll be neededif the Government are ts. retain their target of 500,000 houses by 1970.It is also the year in which the option mortgage scheme will first become operative and which may see the introduction of 100$ mortgages.   For these reasons, it would be exceptionally difficult to obtain savings in 1968/69.Other possible savings31.   We have considered, but dismissed, the possibility of obtainingsavings on other aspects of Housing Expenditure:(I)   Mix and distribution(2)   Mortgage Option Scheme(3)   Rate fund contributions(4)   Improvement grants(5)   Housing Corporation.The main considerations are discussed in Annex E.Ill   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS   ENGLAND AND wales the range 0f  ^ icas32.   On present trends all local authority houses will be designed to fullParker Morris standards by the end of this year.    It is assumed that ministers will regard the additional expenditure involved, at least on themain (space and heating) items, as inevitable.   This will be offset to alimited extent by savings arising from the introduction of cost yardsticks.An increase of 5% ( 45m.) in the PESO Basic total for 1970/71 would be justsufficient tj meet the net additional cost of building all houses ti fullParker Morris standards without any other change having to be made in the authorised programme of approvals.   If the Basic total remains unaltered,savings of  45m. must be found;   and for a reduction of 7^2 the savings would have to amount to some  112m.18.
19.Adjusting housing investment33.   The major choice available is to adjust the number of houses in the authorised public sector programme.   This provides for an increase from about 161,000 approvals in 1965 to about 170,000 approvals in 1966 and1967, and to 181,000 in 1969.   All the savings could be achieved in 1970/71by reducing the programme from 1968 onwards to 167,500 (savings of  45m.)or 151,000 (savings of  112m.) (Paragraphs 14-15)34.    Some mitigation of these reductions might be obtained &quot;by decisionste disallow for housing subsidy the expenditure on the Parker Morrisstandards for equipment and fittings (paragraph 25) and to insist, where-ever possible, on hardstandings in preference to garages (paragraph 26).It is difficult to estimate what savings in capital investment might besecured since many authorities might be unwilling to revert to lowerstandards.   At best the saving could hardly   exceed  15m.35.    The Housing Departments argue that the Basic total should be augmentedby  45m. to allow for the extra cost of improved standards now prevailing.If this were done, the augmented basic total would provide in full forthe authorised number of approvals.   An increase of 5$ would allow forprospective increases in New Town housing without reducing the localauthority allocatisn;    and would   prcvide for an expansion to about250,000 public sector completions in the U.K.&quot;*in 1970.   A reduction of7i^o would mean reducing public sector completions in 1970 to about225,000 (Paragraphs 21-23).36.   Assuming no change in the Scottish and Northern Ireland programmes,the number of houses started and completed by public authorities in theUnited Kingdom in 1970, on each of these different programmes, would be:
TABLE 3.Public sector starts and completions in the United Kingdom in 1970Basic programmesBasic + rfoBasicBasic - l^foAugmented basic programmesAugmented basic + jfoAugmented, basicAugmented basic - 7g$Starts242,000229,000212,500251,000242,000222,000Completions237,000229,000212,500249,000237,000224,50037e   The contribution from the private sector is uncertain but the HousingDepartments consider that if the public sector&apos;s contribution is reduced signifi-cantly below the 237*000 completions in 1970 in the United Kingdom provided forin the present authorised programme, the total output of the two sectors combinedis unlikely to come within a respectable distance of 500,000.   If housingerpenditure were kept to the Basic total the public sector would contribute about230,000 houses in 1970.   The only programme which would allow the public sectorto provide about 250,000 in 1970 is the &quot;Augumented-basic plus 5$&quot; (paragraphs14-16 and 21-23).38.   The marginal effects that any such reductions or increases in the programme would have on satisfaction of housing needs are difficult to assess (paragraphs17-20).Adjusting local authority lending39*   Apart from possible changes in the number of houses to be built, the mainpossibility for consideration is a very different category of expenditure on local authority loans for house purchase.   If housing expenditure were to be keptstrictly within the Basic total, one way of producing savings of  45m. would beto reduce local authority lending by 35$ from  130m. in 1967/68 to  85m. in1970/71.   This saving would be sufficient to enable the number of houses provided
for in the present authorised programme of approvals to be built to the fullParker Morris standards.   But it would involve a very severe system of rationinghome loans between individual local authorities.   Such a cut would be as effec-tive a method of saving public expenditure as cutting the -programme but its effecton the physical resources released would be less.   If the reduction were madeprogressively over the period to 1970/71 and secured mainly by reducing the numberof loans for post-war houses, there would be some prospect that it might be made good by increased lending from other agencies.    (Paragraphs 28-29).Implications for expenditure in 1968/69 and 1969/7040.   If the authorised programme of approvals were reduced in order to achievesavings in 1970/71, there would also be expenditure savings on existing policies in the intervening years.Year	To keep within Basic total in 1970/71	Basic total -l^o in 1970/711968/69	  8m.	 30m.1969/70	 28m.	 76m.To secure savings of the order shown for 1968/69 in the second column wouldrequire an early announcement of drastic cuts in the public sector programme.They assume adjustments of building programmes, involving a cut of 22,500approvals in 1968 and an announcement to this effeot by mid-1967 at the latest.In the view of the Housing Departments, a cut of this size could not be bornewithout a complete abandonment of the Government&apos;s housing objectives.   If theannouncement were not made until the end of 1967, the savings xrould be delayed.In practice the savings to be secured in 1968/69 would be reduced to some  15m.and those in 1969/70 increased to about  90m.41.   Savings in local authority lending for house purchase could not be secured in 1968/69 without the greatest difficulty but there might be some prospect ofobtaining savings of up to  30m. in 1969/70.

The basic programme for housing investment is based on the number of houses in the progression set out in Annex A.   This progression is the line with the ministerial decision in July 1965 that the Scottish programme could build up to amaximum of 38,000 approvals in 1969.   No decision has since been taken aboutlater years, but the Scottish Office&apos;s view is - and has since 1965 been - thatthe programme should build up to at least 40,000 approvals a year in tho public sector.Standards44.  The Parker Morris Report does not apply to Scotland, where comparablestandards have been applied since 1956 when Part 3 of the Scottish Housing Handbookwas published.   Although these standards, which were well ahead22.PART B;   SCOTLANDIV   EXPOSITIONHousing Expenditure42. Estimated housing expenditure in 1970/71 on the basic programme in Scotland,at 1967 prices, is set out in Table 6 belows-Table 6Summary of Housing Expenditure on the basic Programme in 1970-71
23.CONFIDENTIALof contemporary English standards, were at first insisted on only in thecase of flats in multi-storey blocks, they later became mandatory for houses of all types (in the private as well as the public sector) on beingincorporated in the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations, which came into force in June 1964.45,   The space standards in the Handbook are comparable to Parker Morris,although they are expressed in a different way.   (The Scottish standards arein fact slightly lower for the larger house types, but higher for thesmaller house types.)   Standards of storage are also comparable.   Thus, allScottish local authorities have for some years already been building to approximately the same standards of space and storage as those towards whichEnglish authorities are now advanoing.   There are a few respects in which theScottish Handbook standards are lower than in England, but the only one ofany real consequence is heating, and since 90% of houses now being built bylocal authorities in Scotland are in practice&quot; already provided iathstandardsof hunting which go -beyond the Handbook minimum, there is no need in scotland to allov; for major improvements in house standards by 1970-71.U   THE RANGE OF CHOICESThe basic programme46.   The basic programme for 1970/71 is  212.6m.   Increased by 5% it becomes 223.2m.   Decreased by 7^ it becomes  196.7m.   The basic programme is virtually the same as the expenditure to which,,the Scottish  Office considerpresent policies will lead in that year ( 212.1m.).An Increase of 5%47.   An increase of 5% is equivalent to  10.6m. in 197C/71.48.   There are two main directions in which some additional expenditure is .desirable.   First, the 1965 programme envisaged that the number of publiosector houses approved would build up steadily to 40,000 by 1969.   Thedecision referred to in paragraph 43 cut this to 38,000.   The scottish office consider however that there should be a further advance to 42,000 by1971*   If 42,000 approvals were given in 1970 and 1971 this would add 3.7m to the programme in 1970/71, and  5.8m in 1971/72.    If only 21-0,000approvals were given in 1976, advanoing to 42,000 in 1971, this would inpraotice add nothing to the.Basic total in 1970/71 and. 3.7m. in 1971/72.
49.   Second, the Cullingworth report (&quot;Scotland&apos;s Older Houses&quot;) has emphasised the need for greater expenditure on improvement of old houses,as well as on slum clearance, and in particular has drawn attention to the enormous programme of rehabilitation needed in Glasgow.   A drive to increasethe rate of modernisation of improvable houses, coupled with the raising ofthe grant ceilings for improvements by both local - authorities and private owners, would add some  2m. a year to the basic programme by 1970/71.   a major programme to &quot;patch&quot; slum houses in Glasgow which cannot be cleared inthe next five years is also desirable and could build up to about  2m.-3m.a year by 1970/71.5Q.   Apart from these priority needs, it would be desirable to relax therestrictions on local authority loans for house purchase, especially in thelight of the even greater need in Scotland to encourage the private sector.The basic programme provides for only a very small increase in lending by197V71, and there is room for a considerable expansion in lending inScotland, which would take up at least another  2.2m. (net) simply to keep pace with the expansion of new building by the private sector.A Reduction of l^fo51. A reduction of 7i$ on the basic programme is equivalent to almost 16m. This could not be achieved without major alterations in currentpolicies.52.   If the numbers of public sector approvals were restricted to 38,000 ayear from 1969 onwards, this would yield a saving of  3.1m. in 1970/71 and 6m. in 1971/72.   To achieve a  16m. saving in 1970/71 solely by a reductionof housebuilding would require the number of approvals to be reduced to just under 35,000 from 196&quot;8 onwards.   This compares with just over 30,000approvals in 1966 and current attempts to achieve 34,000/35,000 in 1967oIn theory, this reduction could be shared between the S.S.H.A., the new towns and the local authorities, but the effect of cutting the building programme of the S.S.H.A. and the New Towns, which are geared to thegrowth of industry and employment and the movement of labour, would be seriously to affect economic expansion.24e
53.   If, therefore, the cut were applied solely to local authorities, their programme would have to be held at about 2 5,000 approvals from 1968 onwards,compared with the desirable figure of 28,000-30,000 starts required in 1969if the 50,000 target by 1970 is to be achieved.   This would mean outtingbaok now on local authorities&apos; current plans to expand their house-building programmes and publicly abandoning the announced target of 50,000 houses by1970, since there is no real hope of building up the private sector inScotland to compensate for the fall in the public sector.   This would mean the loss ef about 3,500 completed houses by 1970/71 (and progressively more in later years) which would otherwise have been available frr familiesliving in slums or in overcrowded or shared houses, or for old people.54.   There is no prospect of achieving savings by cuts in standards inScotland.   Apart from the point made in Part A of this paper about the timelag between design changes and work done, any significant reduction in standards would involve amendment of the Building Standards (Scotland)Regulations 1963 and it would not be practicable to force local authoritiesin Scotland to reduce the standards to which a statutory instrument hasrequired them to build for some years now.55.   The provision of either garages or hardstandings for most new housesis a requirement of planning policy, but some economies could be made by refusing loan sanction for the building of garages other than in exceptional cases (e,g, where they formed an integral part of the design of a block)and requiring authorities to provide only hardstandings instead.   The netsaving in capital investment (garages will not attract subsidy) might beef the order of  1m.56.   The arguments against attempting to produce savings in housing subsidiesby 1970/71 are the same as those in England and Yfeles (paragraph 27).57.   Savings are also possible by reducing local authority loans for house purchase.   The maximum in 197V71 would be  6^m,, less the total ofrepayments, whicluwould depend on the date on which loans were stopped.It has of course to be borne in mind that the need to encourage the private sector is greater in Scotland than in England.58.   We have considered,but dismissed, other possible savings in housing expenditure in Scotland.   These are discussed in Annex E.25.
VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: SCOTLAND59.   As distinct from England and Wales, existing policies in Scotland aanbe accommodated within the basic programme expenditure figure.60.   There are directions in which expenditure beyond the basic programmefigure could usefully be incurred, but there are at present no firmcommitments or announced policies which would pre-empt that expenditure.61.   Since the amount of lending by local authorities for house purchase in Scotland is proportionately much smaller than in England and Wales,any reduction in it would make a much smaller contribution to the prescribedsavings and would have to be balanced against the greater need in scotland to encourage the private sector.62.   Although, therefore, some minor economies could be made, the only way in which we could plan to make a major saving of the order envisaged inScotland would be to cut back on proposals for new housebuilding in thepublic sector.   This would mean publicly abandoning the announced target of 50,000 houses by 197$, since the private sector in Scotland could notbe expected to make up the difference.26

ANNEX CProposed additional programmes for new towns and for local authorities in England and wales to provide 250,000 public sector completions in the United Kingdom in 19701.     Paragraph 21 of the report explains that a 5% increase on theaugmented basic programme (as proposed by M.H.L.G. and the Welsh Office)would give an extra  47 million in 1970/71 above the estimated expenditureon present policies.   This would be almost enough to provide for theadditional programme proposed for new towns (outlined below) and toincrease public sector completions in the United Kingdom to 250,000 in1970, assuming no change in the Scottish and Northern Ireland programmes.2.     The existing new towns (together with Milton Keynes, the designationof which has now been authorised) are now thought to be capable of carryingout bigger programmes than those provided for in the basic programme;while a further generation of new towns (Ipswich, Northampton, Peterborough,Warrington, Leyland/Chorley) have been approved in principle;   and thereare still further new town projects in the pipeline (Wellington/Oakengates,Ashford, Newtown and Llantrisant).3.     If the projects were approved as additions to the authorisedprogramme, the extra cost in 1 97&apos;V71 would be: m.(a) Existing new towns 13.0(b) New towns approved in principle 15.5(c) New towns under consideration&apos; 8.136.if these additional programmes were approved, public sector completions inthe United Kingdom would rise to about 242,000 in 1979.4.     To ensure that the public sector contributed about half the target of500,000 houses by 1970, the local authority programme in England andWales would need to be increased by a further 8,000 approvals (6,000 in1968 and 2,000 in 1969) at an estimated capital cost of about  32 million,about  13 million of which would fall in 1970/71, leading to additionalsubsidies of less than  1 million a year.29.
5.     The extra expenditure in 1970/71 would be divided between:- m.(i)   the additional New TownProgramme 37(ii)   8,000 more local authority-approvals (6,000 in 1968 and2,000 in 1969) 1047All of this could be accommodated within the extra  47 milliongiven by a 5% increase on the augmented Basic.   This would carryconsiderable increases for roads etc.30.

No provision is made for radiators in thebedrooms.(3)    Wash Basin in the W.C.A separate W.C. not adjoining a bathroom should be provided with a washbasin.(4)    Kitchen Fittings80 cu. feet of enclosed storage space to be provided for dwellings for persons or more, and 60 cu. feet for 1 and 2 person dwellings.   Worktops tobe provided on both sides of the sink and of the cooker.31.
(5)   Electric Socket OutletsThere is a minimum for each type of room. A typical 2 person flatwould have a minimum of 10, a typical 5 person 2-storey house a minimum of 15.(6)   CupboardsBuilt-in bedroom cupboards are NOT a requirement buta linen cupboard is.   Space should however be provided in eachbedroom for a double wardrobe or a built-in cupboard.II. Reduced standards for equipment and fittingsA decision to disallow for subsidy the expenditure on improvedequipment and fittings would mean reverting to minimum standards similarto those laid down in the 1949 Housing Manual.   These have been amendedand reduced over the years, with the result that in certain fields thereis now no generally accepted minimum standard.   But a combination ofaccepted minimum standards and current practice gives the followingcurrent minima:-(l)   W.C. and&apos; Wash BasinOnly one W.C. and one wash basin even for the largest houses.(2)   Kitchen Fittings4-0 cu. feet of enclosed storage space.   Worktops area about  square feet.    (The Parker Morris standard gives something like15 square feet).(3)   Electric Socket OutletsAbout 6 per dwellings, irrespective of size.(4)   CupboardsNo linen cupboard required.32.
ANNEX ESAVINGS ON other aspects OF HOUSING expenditure .     As paragraph 31 of the report explains, we hwe considered, but-dismissed, the possibility of obtaining savings on other aspects of housing expenditure.   In this Annex we consider each in turnsMix and distribution2.     In England and Wales some savings will be obtained, though they are difficult to quantify, by insisting on a higher proportion of low densityschemes and a smaller proportion of high flats.   These arc already assumed in the estimates.   More substantial savings could be obtained by adecision to discourage housebuilding in London since both housing costs and land costs are higher in London than elsewhere.   Against this , london is the area of the greatest housing pressure and it would not be practic-able unless and until additional New Towns are building on n large scale to make good reductions within London by increases outside.   in short there is no real option here open to Ministers.3.     In Scotland there is little prospect of making savings by insisting on a higher proportion of low density schemes.   There is already central control of all proposals to build high-rise schemes, and most localauthorities who undertake high-rise building (notably   Glasgow) have little alternative but to -do so.Mortgage option scheme.     In England and Wales the  37.7 million estimated for 1970/71 is basedon an assumed lending rate of 7e$ and is the gross cost with no offsetfor tax relief which would otherwise be claimed.   It is mainly the costof cumulative commitments in earlier years.   Tho scheme has already been postponed more than once, and fresh legislation would be required tosecure any further postponement or amendment.   We have not considered this further.5.     In Scotland the same considerations apply except that there is-even greater need in Scotland than in England to encourage private sector building.33.
Rate fund contributions6&quot;^     In England and Wales the amount of contribution is known to havebeen rising in recent years, particularly in 1966/67, as a result of the pressure exerted on local authorities not to increase rents during theprices and incomes standstill; and it is also thought that some authori--ties have been keeping rents down, through bigger rate subsidies, in anticipation of the new exchequer subsidies thoy will shortly be paid under the new Bill.   It is estimated that the rate fund contributionsduring 1966-67 amounted to some  49 million.     It is verydifficult to forecast a figure as far ahead as 1970/715 but as the newsubsidies come into payment, and when authorities move away from the period in which they were actively discouraged from putting up their rents, the contribution should fall.   We have assumed that authorities will be encouraged to adopt rent policies which ensure that housing will become a smaller burden on the local ratepayer; and we have therefore retainedthe figure of  16.6 million which had been included in the basic programme for the 1966 survey.7.     Now that exchequer housing subsidies have been trebled for theaverage house (five times in London), it may be argued that rate subsidiesare unnecessary; that if authorities were to adopt far-reaching rent rebate schemes, with low rents for those who cannot afford to pay but witheconomic rents for households with incomes exceeding say  30 a week theywould not need to subsidize tenants from the rates.   On the other hand,a decision to disallow rate-fund contributions would not only require legislation but would also be regarded as intorference with the powersof discretion that local authoritios have at present to fix rent levelsfor their own tenants.   It would also drive up council rents mainly inLondon and in some of the bigger towns.8.     In Scotland the basic programme assumes that various influences willc*ause rents to increase from the present average of about  44 to  58 by1970/7 1.   To achieve bigger increases than this would require legislationpermitting direct Government intervention in the fixing of rents and rent rebates.34.
Improvement grantsgi     in England and Wales the estimated expenditure on improvement grants is very small, only  17 million in 1970/71, and in most casesprivate owners contribute comparable amounts themselves5 preservation of tho housing stock is essential since under any programme of new house-building some millions of old houses will still have to have their lifeprolonged.   The smaller the new house building rate the more importantthe improvement programme. . l/e do not consider that any savings should besecured under this item since the needs under this head are likolyto grow rather than diminish.10.   In Scotland some small saving might be secured by urging localauthorities not to give any more discretionary improvement grants.   Thisis theoretically possible, but is considered to be impracticable in thelight of the recently published report on &quot;3cotland&apos;s Older Houses&quot;.Housing Corporation11.   The Housing Corporation has been slow to get going and it has yet to pnveitself capable of generating a substantial programme of new building.   Themain effect of its -activities is not to increase the number of houses built but to provide houses with a different form of tenure from those providedby other sources.   When the housing target was set in 19^5, it was assumed that housing societies would be able to build 15,000 houses a yearby 1970.    The societies have found however that the cost rents thatthey have to charge for their new flats are so much out of line with localauthority rents, that tho whole future of cost-rent societies is in doubt.The Corporation hopes however that co-ownership will be more successful.It is clear that housing societies will not be able to build anything like15,000 houses a year by 1970 (they started only 2,400 in 1966) and inAsmex A we have assumed their contribution will build up to 7,500 by 1970.By slowing down the approval of new schemes, it might be possible to producesavings of perhaps  10 million in 1970/71 but it would mean abandoning costrent and co-ownership as instruments of housing policy.   &quot;JCffo of a   housingsociety&apos;s finance comes from the building societies,, and this money would presumably either be lent instead for ordinary house purchase, or to come degree to housing associations. The societies might also seek funds from35.
local authorities who are accustomed to lending to the ordinary housing associations.   There would however be some reduction in the money available for house-building, and some reduction (up to 2,000) in thenumber of houses built.   YJq do not consider therefore&apos; that there is any real scope for savings under this head.
