STRATEGIC REVIEW OF THE CYPRUS PROBLEMIntroductionSo long as it remains Her Majesty&apos;s Governments intention to continue, to exert our influence and meet our treaty obligations in the Middle East, to work towards the establishment of a Middle East defence organisation, and to. defend the area in war, it is essential that we should station forces in that theatre.Politically these should be located where they can exercise the greatest influence.Militarily they should be in an area which ensures security of- tenure, reliablepublic utilities, and freedom to come &apos;and go as we please.The Strategic Importance of Cyprus2. Cyprus, being British, was chosen&apos; as&apos; the location of our CombinedHeadquarters as it was the only territory in the Middle East which satisfied the-above conditions.  Its strategic importance to us lies in the following qualities: :(a) The natural advantages inherent in its geographic position. -(b) Its ability to house the necessary elements of our land and air forces inthe Middle East.(c) It provides the site for the Headquarters which in peacetime is the centre.of our military influence with our friends and allies in the middle east and will be the focal point from which we conduct our,.operations in that area in war.(d) It contains two important strategic&apos;airfields on which much money isbeing .spent in order that we may play our full, part in strategicoperations in war.3. Turkey looks on Cyprus as the keystone of British military effort and prestige in the Middle East, and as the focal point of our influence in the area:It is of outstanding importance not only to British military effort but to Middle,East defence as a whole.. No other place remains to us which could fulfil these functions.Our Military Requirements within the Island4. We show on the maps at Appendices A and B respectively the presentand future planned locations of the military units and installations. The majordifferences.between.the two maps are as follows:  (a) Army. . By 1959:-(i) Headquarters, Middle East-Land Forces, will be established - at. Episkopi. .(ii) Permanent barracks will be established in the Dhekelia Canton-ment (One Brigade Headquarters and three Infantry battalions in residence).(b) R.A.F.   By 1959:-  .(i) The airfield at Akrotiri will be fully completed.(ii) Headquarters, Middle East Air Force will&apos; be&apos;established atEpiskopi., 5.. In order that.we&apos;can make full.use of these military facilities; we requirefull user rights of all the island&apos;s public utilities in peacetime and complete controlof the whole island in war, when it would be necessary to declare it a military area.48409 . B &apos;&quot;&apos; &quot;
Types of Threat to Internal SecurityCommunism6. We believe that, of the two sections of Greek-speaking Cypriots demandingEnosis, the Communist has the greater potential power and that the exploitation ofEnosis agitation&apos;is to them only a means by&apos; which they&apos; hope&apos; to achieve thewithdrawal of British forces and the establishment of Communist control overCyprus. Moreover we consider that even the grant of an elective constitutionmight involve the risk of a Communist seizure of power.EOKA -       .7. Sabotage has already taken place in various parts of the island, and intelligence indicates that this is likely to continue. Recent incidents show that.EOKA, the terrorist organisation which is not Communist, has the ability and themeans to continue this successfully. We consider that armed attacks on british personnel is a likely development in a campaign of violence.Passive Resistance8. The major trade unions, which are Communist controlled, have so farcondemned violence as a means of achieving Enosis, and are unlikely to committheir limited funds in support of widespread strike action. However, in case ofbloodshed, relations between the British and Greek-speaking communities mightso deteriorate that a campaign of passive resistance, organised by the Church,could develop.--This would have an adverse effect upon the efficiency of Cyprusas a base.Racial Disturbances9. A policy of deliberate violence by either the Greek or Turkish communitiesagainst each other in Cyprus over Enosis is improbable. This danger would grow,however, if the Turkish-speaking Cypriots and the Turks come to believe that therewas a serious intention on the part of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to hand over the island to Greece. An outbreak of communal strife would seriously impair theefficiency of Cyprus as a base. -Direct Creek or Turkish Government Intervention10. So long as British forces remain in Cyprus, it is most unlikely that either the Greek or Turkish Governments will intervene with direct military action. &apos;0nthe other hand, the Greek Government has already intervened by encouraging theCypriots to violence. Both Greek and Turkish Governments may follow thisby training the Cypriots in sabotage and resistance techniques, and&apos;&apos;by the supplyof arms and leaders.Insurrection   -------    . .11.   So long as a strong British garrison remains in Cyprus, open insurrectionis most unlikely.A bility to meet Threat12: For some.years to come, the Cyprus - police cannot be fully effective without military aid. This will involve tying down major, army units stationed inthe island and a proportion of the R.A.F. and Mediterranean Fleet. &apos; This mightnecessitate the reinforcement of the Middle East for tasks properly theresponsibility of the garrison. Prior to the agreement to hold Three-Power militarytalks on the Eastern Mediterranean, we were unable to foresee an improvementin the internal security situation, and indeed it was more likely to deteriorate.13. We believe that, as has been found necessary in the appointment of directors of Operations elsewhere, the&apos;urgent meed, and the only remedy for thepresent situation, is for the command of all security forces to be vested in oneindividual who would control all security operations and be directly responsible to the Governor. .  . &apos;
Summary14. British influence and prestige in the Middle East as a whole could notbe maintained without the retention of our present military position in Cyprus,which is therefore strategically essential..15. &apos; The value of the island is being gravely impaired by the internal politicalsituation since British: troops with strategic tasks to perform elsewhere are in danger of being tied down to internal security duties in the island..- .16. Unless there is some improvement as a result of the Three-Power talks,the internal situation appears more likely to deteriorate further under internal and external pressure. ..... v -17. If a public announcement is made of our intention to retain british sovereignty, on no account must this be followed by a withdrawal under duress.18. Whilst the Communist element is not openly engaged at present, it needs to be fully understood that it has the greater potential power of the two sections of greek-speaking Cypriots demanding Enosis.Conclusion ,    r19. We are not competent to comment on the many complex political factors involved in the problem of Cyprus, but we are of the opinion that our military requirements within the Island can only be met if the control of its administration in matters of defence, external affairs and internal security remain in British hands.
