ANTARCTICAFollowing the Report of the Committee on Antarctica (CP. (55) 9), the PrimeMinister on 15th May, 1955, approved as an interim measure the implementation of the first year of the five-year plan by the Governor of the Falkland Islands,the purchase of a support vessel for the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey(F.I.D.S.) the placing of a contract for an aerial survey and the provision of air support for the Trans-Antarctic Expedition.Expanded Programme for the F.I.D.S.: &apos;2. The Governor lias now submitted for approval his programme for 1955-56,which includes the establishment of two new bases together with a general increasein activity at the eight existing bases. The scientific aspects of this programmehave been approved by the F.I.D. Scientific Committee, and the necessaryrecruitment of personnel and purchase of stores is progressing3.&apos; A new support vessel, to.replace the Norsel, has now been examined and approved by the Governor and his Technical Advisers. This ship, the Arenclal,is being purchased for  230,000; it will require certain alterations for which theColonial Office have set aside a further  30,000. (The total expenditure of  260,000compares with  250,000 recommended by the Committee on Antarctica.)Naval Support4. The conversion of H.M.S. Protector is proceeding in accordance with thedecision recorded in paragraph 21 of CP. (55) 9. She will be available to providenaval support during the Antarctic season starting in November 1955.Air Survey5. Hunting Aerosurveys, Ltd., one of the two companies referred to inparagraph 12 of-CP. (55) 9, have now been informed that their proposals are acceptable and that they may, on deposition of a bond with the Crown agents for the Colonies, receive up to  50,000 for essential expenditure prior to the signing of a contract. The company have chartered a vessel, the Olaf Sven, which is beingmodified to carry a - helicopter, and the main party are expected to leave thiscountry on about 18th October, 1955. The two Canso aircraft involved are beingmodified in Canada for the purposes of the survey. &apos;, &quot; .. ;-,Trans-Antarctic Expedition6. Planning for the expedition, which is dealt with in paragraphs 13 to 15 of cp. (55) 9, is going ahead on the proposed basis. The New Zealand Governmenthave promised a contribution of  50,000, and Sir Edmund Hillary, who has been nominated by the New Zealand Committee as the leader of the Ross Sea Party,is at present in this, country discussing arrangements with the expedition^Committee of Management. The Australian Government have still come to no decision on their contribution to the expedition, but the South African Governmentseem likely to make some contribution, both in men and material.7. On the question of air support for the expedition (see also paragraph 24of CP. (55) 9), two Austers are being provided by the Royal Air Force, and their. preparation is in hand. The R.A.F. could also operate the two Beavers or equivalent aircraft which are additionally required, but they do not possess anytypes suitable for this purpose and the question of an R.A.F. requirement forBeavers has been abandoned. An informal approach to the Royal CanadianAir Force for the loan of suitable aircraft has been unsuccessful and the expeditionis making other enquiries.International Geophysical Year8. The question of establishing a United Kingdom base at Vahsel Bay hasbeen further discussed with the Royal Society and the Governor of the falkland islands has agreed that, if it is decided to establish an international geophysicalyear base at Vahsel Bay, the F.I.D.S. will be ready to act as agents to the royal society in setting up and maintaining the base.
9. The Antarctic Committee of the International Geophysical Year met in Paris from 6th July to 9th July to co-ordinate the plans of the various interestedcountries for the establishment of stations in Antarctica. The Russians (whohave for long wished to obtain a foothold in the Antarctic) announced that they intended to set up three stations in the Australian Antarctic territory (one of them at the South Pole). The Argentines and Chileans announced that their existingbases in the Falklands Islands Dependencies would participate. The United states representatives stated that they would set up two stations in the Ross Dependency,one at the South Pole, one in the Australian Antarctic Territory, one in the falkland Islands Dependencies and a further one in territory so far unclaimed inMarie Byrd Land. Other stations are likely to be set up (with or. without permission) by Belgian, Japanese and possibly German Antarctic Expeditions. Inaddition, the United Kingdom, Australian, New Zealand, French and Norwegian Governments are all setting up stations in their own Antarctic territories.Proposals requiring further Examination .10.   The three final proposals in paragraph 36 (c) of CP. (55) 9, which involvelarge-scale expenditure, are still under examination. These are:  (i) The Construction of an Ice-Breaker (paragraph 22 of CP. (55) 9)The Colonial Office now feel some doubt as to the need for such an expensive vessel when smaller and less costly ships might suffice. It has beenarranged that the Governor of the Falkland Islands shall discuss this proposalfurther with the Admiralty during the present month. Apart from the needfor providing adequate naval support in the Antarctic, there is no Admiraltyrequirement for an ice-breaker; meanwhile the Admiralty are proceeding withtheir enquiry into the cost of a suitable ship.(ii) Air Support for F.I.D.S.The Governor has been consulted on the question of air support for theF.I.D.S. and agrees that air support would be useful . for inter-basecommunication. Further consideration is being given to the, scale of air support which might be desirable and the likely cost of it.(iii) Airfield for the Falkland IslandsThe question of the construction of an airfield in the Falkland Islands isto be discussed shortly between the Air Ministry and the Governor. ; no estimate of the likely cost is yet available.Summary11.   (i) Approval has been given for, and action is being taken on:  (a) An increase in ground activity for next season.(b) The purchase of a support vessel.(c) The aerial survey.(d) Air support for the Trans-Antarctic expedition.(e) Conversion of H.M.S.
