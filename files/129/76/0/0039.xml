351 j*\Interim Report by the Committee on Security in the ColoniesFollowing a decision of the Cabinet on 5th November, 1954 (C.C. (54) 73rd((inclusions. Minute 1), a Committee of Ministers was set up, initially under therjairmanship of Lord Swinton, &quot; to review the existing organisation of armed forces, Police and Security Services in Colonial territories.&quot; At their first meeting,ii Committee invited General Sir Gerald Templer to carry out a review on thesejaes and to make recommendations.2. General Templer&apos;s report, a copy of which is attached, embodied a number((detailed recommendations. Of these, the following were regarded as of particularjportance, and have been accepted by the Committee:  (i) That separate Police and Intelligence Departments should be set up withinthe Colonial Office additional to and separate from the existing defence department.(ii) That the charter of the Joint Intelligence Committee should be withdrawn and re-issued jointly by the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of defence and the Colonial Secretary.(iii) That the Colonial Office should be permanently represented on the joint intelligence Staff as well as on the Joint Intelligence Committee.(iv) That the United Kingdom should if necessary contribute financially to theestablishment of Regional Police Training Colleges.is regards assistance for internal security, particularly police housing, theCommittee agrees that the United Kingdom should be prepared to give financialkip to Colonies which are grant-aided, or on the verge of grant-in-aid; in the caseof Colonies which appear able to afford the cost, although some Stsistance is notRiled out 4 the first essential is to see that internal security is given its properpriority.3. On the military aspects of General Templer&apos;s report, in view of the technicallature of the issues involved, the Committee have set up a small Sub-Committee of officials to make recommendations with particular regard to the system of commandsad administration necessary to achieve zonal systems of defence in East and WestAfrica. It is expected that the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations will be available by about the middle of August.4. In the course of his investigation, General Templer asked that the role of the Colonies in war should be re-examined by the Chiefs of Staff. They reportedIC.O.S. (55) 42) with the following conclusions (see paragraphs 188-191 of GeneralTempler&apos;s report):  &quot; The role of the Colonies in war should be:  (i) to provide for their internal security;(ii) to provide, as far as possible, for their own local defence;(iii) to provide for Commonwealth land, sea and air forces such installationsas are necessary to facilitate their strategic employment;(iv) to provide reserves of man-power on which we can draw after the firstphase of nuclear war to sustain whatever operations are necessary;(v) to provide such industrial and material resources as can be developed.&quot;The above assumptions are basic to the further examination of the military implications of the report, and the Committee endorses them. The generaldescription of the role of Colonial forces might then be &quot; to provide for local and regional defence requirements.&quot; As a corollary they also agree in principlethat the system of administration of Colonial forces by the War Office should bereplaced by administration by Colonial Governments, who would thereafterbecome primarily responsible for the financing of their own forces. This principleb not intended to be applied simultaneously over the whole field, but would becarried into effect in individual territories or regions at a pace dictated by local circumstances and after consultation with the Colonial Governments concerned.5. The Colonial Secretary is unable to accept General Templer&apos;s recom-mendation with regard to a &quot; colour bar in reverse &quot; (paragraph 167) in view
of its likely effect on the morale of European Police Officers at present servinin the territories concerned.   The Committee felt themselves bound to accrthe Colonial Secretary&apos;s views on this matter, and accordingly agreed not to preathe recommendation, while expressing the hope that everything possible woullbe done to promote senior African officers wherever possible.6.   In addition to the recommendations set out in paragraph 2 above, number of detailed recommendations have been accepted or are under acti\fconsideration by the Colonial Office.  A further report on these will be submiltin due course.

INTRODUCTION&quot; The road to the victory of the Revolution in the West lies through a revolutionaryalliance with the liberation movements of the colonies and dependent territoriesagainst Imperialism,&quot; Stalin.&quot; Our objective must be to prevent trouble breaking out.&quot; My directive.(1) The problem the object of this Report is to suggest ways and means for preventing troublefrom breaking out in the Colonies during the longish period of cold war envisaged in my Directive; and to ensure that, in the event of a hot war, the Colonial armed forces are well adapted to the role they would probably have to play.(2) The Enemy2. Our enemy in the cold war is of course Communism. But in the Coloniesthis threat is for the most part indirect and intangible; it operates,if at all, throughthe medium of other anti-British manifestations which would be present even if theCommunist Party had never been invented. Such manifestations are created bya wide variety of irritants, of which some of the most obvious are nationalism,racialism, religion, frustration, corruption and poverty. It is with these factorsthat we must chiefly do battle to-day. In Malaya, it is true, the fight is to keep a frontier against Communism. But in the other colonies its immediate impact is small or non-existent. In Africa, for example, the Northern Rhodesian copper-beltshould be, according to Marxian theory, the imperialists&apos; weak spot; but in factour troops are fighting reactionary tribalism in Kenya, and may next be fightingoutraged nationalism in Somaliland. So we are faced with a duel enemy theimmediate anti-British elements, of whatever origin, and the Russians in the background, seeking how best to exploit them.3. The way in which the Russians hope such exploitation should proceed isfamiliar enough. First the basic irritants are worked upon. Next comes theestablishment of a progressive &quot; United Front,&quot; based on the local educated classes.This is extended to include the industrial workers and peasantry. A localCommunist Party is then established to seize control of it; local administrative services, especially the police, are penetrated; confidence in the government authority is weakened by acts of violence and sabotage, and in the &quot; revolutionarysituation &quot; so created the Communists hope to start an insurrection and seizepower.4. Such is the ideal process, according to Communist doctrine. But well before it reaches its culminating point, it can be assumed that we shall have had to intervene. It is with this stage of the process the point at which the local internal security services are no longer equal to the task, and United Kingdom troops haveto be sent in that I conceive the present enquiry to be concerned. The object ofmy recommendations is to ensure that this point is not reached.(3) The Defence5. It is obvious that, in order to prevent trouble of any kind breaking out,intelligence, police and armed forces must be efficient. These are dealt with in chapters I, II and III of this Report respectively. It has also seemed to meadvisable to make certain special recommendations for immediate action in areas where troubles likely to lead to the despatch of troops seem most to be feared;these &quot; trouble spots &quot; are dealt with in Chapter IV. But there is of course thefar greater problem, of how to improve the internal security, in the truest sense, ofall these widely differing territories. My directive, though couched in broad terms for which I am grateful, can hardly he held to cover measures which might, evenon a fairly long-term view, so affect the hearts and minds of the people in any territory that the chances of a demand for military reinforcements would be appreciably reduced. And yet I am sure that this goes to the heart of the matter.I have therefore embodied such recommendations as I have to make under this heading in Chapter VI, at the end. The financial implications of this Report arecursorily dealt with in Chapter V.
(4) The System of Colonial government. Any outsider rash enough to suggest to a member of the Colonial office that, in certain circumstances, more positive direction from Whitehall might bedesirable, will almost certainly be reminded that it was such action which led tothe loss of thirteen Colonies at once. It is of course right that the date 1776 shouldbe graven on the hearts of all who are concerned with Colonial affairs. But it makes it very difficult for anyone charged, like myself, with putting up positiverecommendations for action. One is reminded, firmly and correctly, thatGovernors exist to govern, that the Colonial Office does not run colonial territories, and that their job is to advise; if necessary, to exhort; but rarely, if ever,to command.7. This being the case and I do not attempt to deny the constitutionalprinciple involved the would-be author of recommendations in this field has tobe prepared to face not only the familiar Treasury objection that the money can&apos;tbe found for them, but also the more recondite one that the Governor can&apos;t be told to do them. In other words, not only the Treasury, but the Governor as well,must be persuaded that the measures are desirable, and, it may well be, urgent!This second aspect of the matter involves the relationship between the Secretaryof State for the Colonies and Governors a subject on which I am not of course ina position to make recommendations, other than to say that in the present state ofthe cold war it seems to me very necessary that Governors should be givendirection of a more detailed and explicit nature, on certain vital subjects (such asintelligence and the police), than has been customary.8. This leads me to another of the difficulties with which the well-intentionedmeddler in Colonial affairs is faced. Besides convincing the Treasury, the ColonialOffice and the Governors that his recommendations are sound, he must satisfyhimself that any necessary machinery they may require, and the men to drive that machinery, exist in London. This, too, is delicate ground for the outsider to tread.But I have not hesitated to make recommendations for innovations in ColonialOffice machinery, as I am quite certain that without them my other recommendations will not achieve their maximum effect. I think, indeed, that had such machinery already been in existence, many of my recommendations would probably not have been necessary; for certainly not all of them are novel.9. Assuming, for the moment, that Treasury, Colonial Office and Governorsare united in their determination to get a Colonial Government to do something,there are in theory the Governor^ &quot; reserve &quot; powers available to force it through.But as the constitutional advance of the territories progresses this weapon becomesincreasingly difficult to wield. Short of that, there are the Governor^ powers ofpersuasion. But even the ablest Governor, with the whole weight of the ColonialOffice thrown in behind him, may fail to convince a stubborn Minister or Ministers.What is there left?   The answer is &quot; money.&quot;(5) Finance10. If Her Majesty&apos;s Government will produce the money, or a reasonableproportion of the money, a financial inducement is offered which is in itself likelyto make those responsible in the territory agree to the measure for which it isrequired. The argument against such a course is that it goes against the grain ofpolitical and constitutional development. But on balance, and because of the vitalneed to win the cold war, and to lead these territories safely along the road which has been decided upon, it seems that this method should be adopted as an extreme measure for certain services related to internal security, and over the nextfew years. Speaking generally, the necessity for it should not be difficult to sellto Asian or African politicians, though there may be certain exceptions.11. The general recommendations involving substantial sums are regionalcolleges (say, in round terms,  250,000 capital,  50,000 recurrent) and extra staffon police and intelligence inspection duties (say  25,000 recurrent). (see chapter V: Finance.) These figures are simply an indication of order of magnitude; they make no pretence at accuracy. If the recommendations inquestion are to be realised without delay as they must be Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment will in all probability have to foot most, if not all, the bill. With themechanics of this I am not concerned. I would only say that, on the assumptionthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government pay the lot, it is a diminutive insurance premiumcompared not only with a high degree of risk but also with a high degree of loss.
12. Since the start of the Malaya and Kenya troubles,  32,000,000 has beengiven to those two territories in grants, apart from loans. Over and above this, there is the direct cost of the operations to Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Ihave been unable to ascertain what this is in the case of Kenya, but for Malayathis cost is something between  7,000,000 and  8,000,000 per annum. Comparedwith this, my possible  250,000 capital and  75,000 recurrent seem very smallbeer, particularly when viewed alongside the eventual saving to the United Kingdomof  3-1 million a year (of which  1-5 million should be effected in the near future)which should result from my recommendations in the Armed Forces section.13. Over and above the general recommendations, there are specific recommendations in respect of the &quot; trouble spots,&quot; which I have not been ableto cost.(6) Welfare v. Law and Order14. Apart from the problem of raising money from the Treasury, thereis the problem of seeing that Colonial territories spend their own money to thebest effect. Here of course one comes up at once against the old constitutionalsnag; they can spend it as they please. But there is one aspect of public finance-in the Colonies which is directly relevant to this Report, and that is the conflict between the claims of &quot; welfare &quot; and &quot; law and order.&quot;15. There are two main ways of tackling Communism economic action, toprevent or check it at the source, and police action, to contain or suppress it. Inthe Colonies the emphasis has hitherto been on the first approach, which is obviously the only constructive one. But if Malaya had spent on law and order afair proportion of the large sums she was devoting to welfare, the present emergency, with the attendant colossal expenses, might well have been avoided.I submit, therefore, that the state of the cold war to-day and of our defences against it, may call for a temporary change of emphasis. Improving economic conditionsdo not always mean political tranquillity; on the contrary, the desire to seeimprovement accelerated is a potent source of unrest. In the process of evolution,the development of welfare must not allow the preserving of public order a primary function of the government to go neglected. The Romans putcommunications and policing first; and it is still true that, unless these are sound,social and political development cannot be given full rein. This truth shouldbe driven home, in whatever ways are most appropriate, to Colonialadministrations.(7) The Problem of Hand-over16. One of the points which has struck me most in the course of this enquiryhas been the contrast between the time we had in India, Burma and Ceylon toprepare for the hand-over, compared with that we have in the colonies to-day.The reason we could give the Sinhalese a police force which was the model for theEmpire was that, for decades beforehand, we had been training them up for eventual control, by giving them positions of authority. In Kenya to-day thereare two Asian police officers, and no Africans. The Gold Coast will be getting,in 18 months, an &quot; army &quot; which it will not be fit to have for 20 years. the pace has been set, the race for &quot; independence &quot; is on, and all we can do now is to make what sense of it we can. The only way to do this, paradoxically enough,is to make the pace for the first stage of hand-over quicker still. Instead of trying to hang on to the native regiments for as long as possible on the perfectly sensibleground that their governments are not fit to take them over, we should hand the mover as soon as ever is practicable, on the equally sensible and far more cogentground that the longer their future owners have to run them in under oursupervision, the less mess are they likely to make of them in the end.17. Another aspect of the pre-hand-over period which is worth mentioninghere is that as the day of independence draws nearer a local government tendsincreasingly to look around for chips to put on its shoulder. This is particularly unfortunate, as it makes them suspicious of anything smelling of federation orpooling of resources, which very often is of course the only sensible answer totheir problems. One can only hope that this stage will wear away as adolescencedevelops into maturity.-(8) Outline of Recommendations18. Against the background outlined above, I have reached a variety of conclusions.  The recommendations are listed in the index. Those on the armed
3S2^\forces do not lend themselves so well to this treatment, being rather a continuousdevelopment of certain consequences from certain premises; the detailed recommendations for individual territories are set out in Chapter III A. 5(paragraphs 231 to 270). The whole can be very briefly highlighted as follows.(a) Intelligence19. In the field, three Deputy Security Intelligence Advisers should beappointed. Local Intelligence Committees should be reorganised. Political reports and intelligence reports should not, as now, be confused,    i20. At home, an Intelligence Department should be formed in the ColonialOffice to deal with this subject exclusively. Various other steps should be taken,reflecting a heightened &quot; intelligence-mindedness &quot; both in the Colonial Office andin the territories.(b) Police21. In the field, Regional training colleges should be set up, to help fill the gap in training facilities. Two additional Deputy Inspectors-General should beappointed.  Africanisation should be accelerated.22. At home, a Police Department should be formed in the Colonial Office,charged with actively prosecuting all police matters.(c) Armed Forces23. The role of the Colonial Forces being now established as primarily internal security, and the imperial defence element having been largely eliminated, the forces as a whole, though not the number of major units, can be substantially reduced,and their control transferred, as and when practicable, to the Colonial territories,who will also be responsible for financing them. (This is a very rough summaryof a complex subject.) In the event of global war, the African1 Colonies will beasked for a Brigade Headquarters and Brigade Signal Section and three infantry battalions with a small administrative backing from each of East and West Africa,for service in the Middle East. The United Kingdom Strategic Reserve should contain a &quot; Fire Brigade&quot; of three battalions organised for Colonial internal security duties. There should also be available an increment of administrative,police and intelligence officers, and six light aircraft.24.  Various recommendations are made on outstanding contentious issues.(d) Trouble Spots25.   I recommend detailed action to deal with shortcomings in these areas.(9) Conclusion26. I feel I should say that the only territories I have visited in connectionwith this Report are Cyprus and Uganda. Otherwise I have had to rely on myknowledge of analogous problems in Malaya in particular, and in the Far Eastin general, and of Palestine in the days of the Mandate from which many lessonscan be learned.27. In the interests of simplicity, I have treated the problem throughoutas one affecting the Colonial Office, and have not made any reference to theCommonwealth Relations Office, which is of, course responsible for the high commission territories. It will be readily apparent which of my recommendationsaffect the latter, and which do not. (The principal reference td them is inAppendix I, paragraph 406 (c).)28. I have received the greatest possible help from all levels of the ColonialOffice, the Department of State which is primarily concerned with every aspect of this Report, and in particular from Mr. Carstairs. I owe a similar debt to theSecurity Service, and in particular to Mr. MacDonald.29. I have interviewed many people, and I am grateful to them all for the help they have given me.30. Finally, I should like to thank Sir Norman Brook for putting at mydisposal Sir George Young, who has been my very able assistant in this investigation.GERALD TEMPLER.Ministry of Defence,23rd April, 1955.
INTELLIGENCE&quot; In this study we suggest that special attention should be given to the possibility of strengthening Colonial police and security services. These are the front line ofdefence against subversion and we are informed that recent experience has revealeddefects in their organisation. Efficient police forces and Intelligence Services arethe best way of smelling out and suppressing subversive movements at an early stage, and may save heavy expenditure on military reinforcements. They are an insurance we cannot afford to neglect.&quot;-Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s Report on defence (C. (54) 329), 2nd November, 1954.A.-GENERAL31. It is possible that, had our intelligence system been better, we might havebeen spared the emergency in Kenya, and perhaps that in Malaya. It must be our objective so to improve the present system that we are, so far as is humanlypossible, insured against similar catastrophes in future. As in all forms of insurance, this will involve paying a premium. The total bill for my recommenda-tions under this heading should not, at a very rough guess, much exceed, in roundfigures,  30,000 capital expenditure and  20,000 recurrent (see Chapter V, Finance).But a first-rate intelligence system is not unfortunately something that can beproduced simply by deciding to spend more money on it. The limiting factor isskilled man-power, and this means long-term training. The skilled man-powermust also be skilfully employed, and this means expert organisation. training and organisation are the two headings under which my recommendations cangenerally be grouped; they are also the spheres where, according to the J.I.C.(J.I.C. (54) 49), there is &quot; the greatest need &quot; for improvement.B.-TRAINING32. The need is for increased training in Special Branch work. It must be explained, at this point, that the functions of a Special Branch in a colonial territory are quite different from those of the Special Branch of the UnitedKingdom police. It is responsible, in the colonies, for all forms of counter-intelligence, and is the basis of the whole security intelligence system. This doesnot, however, exclude the ordinary police from playing an active part, particularlyin the early stages of an investigation. This is not sufficiently realised today.33. Any stepping-up of intelligence activity, such as must be our objective,thus involves an increased demand on Special Branches, which is expressed largely in a demand for more trained men. This leads in turn to a demand for increasedtraining facilities, without which expansion is impossible.34. At present Colonial officers have had to rely, for such training in special branch work as they can get, on the Security Service, who have, since 1950, trained290 officers overseas and 140 in the United Kingdom. This is only a drop in theocean of what needs to be done; only one or two of the above for example, were from West Africa, Central Africa and the Caribbean, the great majority beingfrom the Far East. The training commitment is now so large that it is no longer possible to meet requests from the colonies on an ad hoc basis, and a veryconsiderable back-log is accumulating. How to meet the need for expandedtraining is the most serious problem with which the intelligence organisation is -faced.. 35. It is agreed by all concerned that the chief remedy is to be found in regional training colleges. In paragraph 127 of this report, in the section on the Police,I propose that such colleges be set up, primarily for straightforward police training,in the Caribbean, West Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, and the Far East-thelast being a development of an existing school. There should, in addition, be fourspecial Branch Training Units, devoted exclusively to Special Branch training inme Caribbean, West Africa, East and Central Africa together, and the Far East,the Instructors should be United Kingdom-trained.36. I attach at Appendix II my proposals for the establishment of these units and for the future structure of the courses to be run both by the Security service in London and by Regional Special Branch training wings. These proposals have
352. pC-ORGANISATIONGeneral ,42. Whereas in the military world &quot; Intelligence&quot; is a highly specialisedfield of its own, in the Colonial (and other civilian) services it naturally tends to beregarded as rnerely one aspect of the political &quot; knowledge &quot; which permeates thewhole business&apos;of administration. Nor is this aspect held to be a very important one; &quot; intelligence &quot; is often considered to be a narrow, if sensational, function ofthe police. The administration is apt not to concern itself closely with themachinery for its collection and appreciation, nor with its relation to security inthe broadest sense. As a result, security intelligence has I think come to be regardedas a kind of spicy condiment added to the Secretariat hot-pot by a supernumeraryand possibly superfluous cook, instead of being a carefully planned and expertlyserved dish of its own. The- recommendations which follow are designed toensure that intelligence receives careful and, so far as possible expert, handlingall the way along the line. I am convinced that in these critical times this is theonly possible approach.43. There is another difficulty, which derives from the constitutionalinhibitions of the Colonial Office. The validity of these it is not for me to contest;but if accepted they make the organisation of any efficient Imperial intelligencesystem impossible. The object of intelligence, the Colonial Office maintain, is toserve the Colonial Governments, on whom the responsibility for action falls inthe first place; London is consequently regarded as an&quot; information &quot; rather than an &quot; action &quot; addressee. According to them, any increase in reporting from theColonies to the Colonial Office and from the Colonial Office to the J.I.C -in other\at my request been worked out by the Headquarters of the Security Service, whohave taken the advice of Mr. C. Fenner, now Head of the Special Branch in theFederation of Malaya, who until recently has had very considerable experience inrunning the Special Branch training school in that country. The Security service is prepared to organise the proposed courses in London at the earliest date onwhich the Colonial Office is able to nominate suitable officers to attend. For the senior courses a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve officers at a time isrequired.37. In addition to these proposals, the Security Service will be willing to give further assistance by helping to provide local training to Special Branches in colonial territories, and by giving assistance with the setting up of the regionalSpecial Branch training units.38. The rough capital cost of establishing these regional training units isguessed at  30,000 and the rough recurrent charges at  6,000. The cost shouldbe borne, in part at any rate, by the territories concerned in proportion to thenumber of their students or the establishment of their Special Branches.39. These regional courses, which would be primarily practical, would haveto be supplemented by increased Security Service courses in the United Kingdom,which would deal with the more abstruse side of training, both ideological andtechnical. The only extra cost which should be borne by the colonial governments would be a small sum to cover the passages and maintenance forselected officers sent back to the United Kingdom to attend the courses. inside the Security Service the instruction would be handled by their special trainingsection of three officers, and by other specialist officers of the Security Service as required.40. The combination of the regional and United Kingdom courses would, inthe opinion of all concerned, do as much as anything can to solve the problem oftraining, and so lay, as rapidly as possible, a firm foundation for futureintelligence work.Recommendation41. That Special Branch training units be set up, attached, where practicable,to the Regional Training Colleges referred to in paragraph 127; that increasedtraining in Security Intelligence work be given by the Security Service in theUnited Kingdom; and that the Security Service should help with the local trainingof Special Branch personnel in Colonial territories.
words the kind of improvement in the flow of intelligence from the periphery tothe centre which my recommendations involve is unlikely to affect appreciablythe prospects of action being taken to avoid trouble in a colony breaking out.44. I cannot believe this is right. If the Colonial Office is to be largely aninformation rather than an action addressee, there seems little point in havingone at all! But so long as it is responsible, to any degree, for policy, it must have at its disposal, in the most efficient form, the intelligence on which policy has tobe based. It may be that extra reporting will not appreciably affect the prospects of action being taken to avoid trouble in a Colony breaking out; but it will atleast ensure that inaction is not due to lack of information, and that UnitedKingdom troops do not have to be sent out as a result of the breakdown of anintelligence system organised by, and finishing at, say, Nicosia.45. Subject to the above, I agree that the administration must be made torealise that it is responsible for the production of an efficient intelligence organisation and for maintaining its efficiency. Nothing in my report is intendedto reduce that responsibility in any way.I. In the Field46. Apart for the normal work carried out in the Colonial Office generally,the Imperial side of the Intelligence system consists of the Security IntelligenceAdviser (S.I.A.), lately seconded by M.I.5 to the Colonial Office, and a number ofM.I.5 Security Liaison Officers (S.L.O&apos;s.) posted to certain Colonial territories.The S.I.A., who is in close contact with Security Service Headquarters, is responsible through the Colonial Office for advising Colonial Administrations onthe more effective organisation of security machinery. The S.L.O&apos;s are responsible to the Director General, Security Service, and serve as the link with ImperialIntelligence. They advise the Administrations to which they are accredited on technical matters, and ensure that the resources of the Security Service are available if required.47.   I propose that this machine be strengthened in the following manner.(1) Deputy Security Intelligence Advisers48. As any improvement in organisation means in fact having more trained men available, the first step is to see whether any can be diverted to the Coloniesfrom their present jobs with the Security Service. It might be thought that this organisation has so clearly succeeded in getting on top of the Communist Party inthe United Kingdom that it would be reasonable to ask that more of its attention should now be given to the Colonies. But about a third of the present staff arealready engaged on Colonial and Commonwealth security of one kind or another,and any considerable increase in this proportion would be hard to justify.Nevertheless, the Director General informs me that he will do his best to meetthe further commitments envisaged in this report.49. Three additional Security Service men of the requisite experience and quality should be appointed Deputy S.I.A&apos;s directly under the Security IntelligenceAdvisor of the Colonial Office. Their primary duty would be that of travellingadvisers and inspectors. (It has been found that advice is more readily taken,and carries more weight, if it comes from someone based on London, rather than from a local or regional expert.)50. The next step towards a strengthened organisation in the field should,I thought at first, be the appointment, in the trouble-spots and for an emergencyperiod of two years, of expert Directors of Intelligence provided by the security service, to be chairmen of the L.I.C&apos;s. But I have reluctantly come to theconclusion that this arrangement, although in theory calculated to induce themaximum efficiency in the local machine, might in practice tend to top-heavinessand friction. I have therefore only recommended its adoption in the case of cyprus, where the situation clearly demands it. Elsewhere, I propose to leave tothe Deputy S.I.A&apos;s the task of helping Intelligence Committees, in all areas, to runin the most efficient manner. While this means abandoning expert control infavour of expert advice, it has the merit of emphasising the point I made earlieron, namely, the responsibility of the local administration for maintaining an efficient intelligence organisation. Given proper co-operation by Governors-and,if necessary, proper support for the S.I.A. from the Colonial Office an advisoryfunction should suffice.
Recommendations51. (a) Three Deputy S.I.A&apos;s to be seconded by Security Service to ColonialOffice under the S.I.A.(b) These Deputy S.I.A&apos;s to advise on the functioning of Local IntelligenceCommittees.(2) Security Service Representatives52. Next, I propose that the title of S.L.O. be abolished and replaced bythat of Security Service Representatives (S.S.R.); the change connotes a more activefunction. The S.S.R. would perform liaison duties with the H.Q. of the security service. He would have much the same function as the existing S.L.O.: governors should, however, be instructed to regard him as an active member of the staff, and consult him more frequently than is at present often the case.Recommendation53.   S.L.O&apos;s to become S.S.R&apos;s and play a more active part.(3) Secondment to Special Branch54. In view of the fact that certain posts in Special Branch need to be held bypersonnel of superior calibre and education, and it is necessary to create domesticlinks between the Administration and the Security Or/ usation, thereby wideningthe area of security intelligence knowledge, Goverr should be encouraged tosecond one or two members of the administration ... Special Branch for two orthree-year tours and to arrange for their training.Recommendation55.   The Governor to encourage secondment to special branch.(4) Local Intelligence Committees(a) Chairmanship56. The institution of these Committees was a very useful step in the right direction. But various changes must, I think, be made if they are to function aswell as they might. In the first place, it should be accepted in principle, as the ideal, that the Chairman of an L.I.C. is someone who has nothing else to do exceptdeal with intelligence, and who is the Governors prime source of intelligenceinformation. It is not something which can be produced without a lot of trouble,and a busy man has no time for this. The Colonial Secretary, or even Governor,who presides in the vast majority of cases, must grudge even the half hour or soonce a fortnight which may be all he can spare for LLC. meetings. He certainlycannot be an expert in the subject, even in the product, and far less in matters of intelligence organisation.57. As a general principle the Chairman should wherever possible be a senior officer of the administration who must be allowed to devote the maximum amountof time to the job. He should take steps to inform himself on the organisationand working of intelligence matters, both in his territory and in London e.g., inLondon, by attending LLC. meetings, seeing the working of the J.I.S. and of thenew proposed Intelligence Department, and by talks with the Security Service;and, in his territory, by familiarising himself with the work of Special Branch andany other intelligence organs which may exist.58. In all areas, the Chairman of the L.I.C. must make the effective presen-tation of all intelligence.information to the Governor. The Governor, would ofcourse still be free to consult his Commissioner of Police on matters of internal security. The Governor may from time to time hear some item of intelligencewhich appears to run counter to the situation depicted in his L.I.C. report. Hemay hear this from some person who is or is not a member of the LLC. He, should then insure that this item is put into the L.I.C. machinery and properly processed.59. The Governor should not rest content merely with receiving regularintelligence reports. He should use the Chairman as a source of ad hoc reports on any particular subjects in which he may at the moment be interested. Forexample, if the Governor felt that he did not know all that he should, about theCommunist penetration of local schools, he would ask the Chairman for a report
351Son it. The Chairman would probably pass this task in the first instance to special branch, then have the product studied in L.I.C., and finally send the consideredresult to the Governor.  This need not take more than 24 hours, if necessary.60. The Special Branch, on which the Chairman of the L.I.C. would largely depend, would remain an integral part of the police, subject solely to the admin-istrative and executive authority of the Police Commissioner.61. The duties of the Chairman can be summarised as responsibility for the promotion of intelligence policy in general, and in particular for seeing that it is kept sufficiently flexible to adapt itself to changing conditions; the co-ordinationof the resources of all agencies contributing intelligence; the giving of advice onthe organisation of intelligence as a whole; and finally an appreciation of the factthat if good intelligence is to be available, the man responsible must go and look for it, and not rest content with the proceedings of periodical meetings. In respectof these activities he is answerable to the Governor.Recommendation   .62. The Chairman to be able to devote adequate time to, and fit himself for.the job, particularly in the trouble spots.(b) Secretaryship63. All L.I.C.&apos;s, except perhaps those of the smallest and politically mostunimportant territories, should have a full-time secretary, with no other duties;this is particularly important in areas where the Chairman is not himself anintelligence expert. He would be provided by the Administration, though incertain territories it may be convenient for the S.S.R. to fill the post.Recommendation64.   Each L.I.C. to have a full-time Secretary.(c) Functioning65. The above arrangements should enable the machine to function efficientlyon the ground. But some further degree of general guidance from the centre is called for.66. The importance of this subject warrants, I submit, a new approach toGovernors by the Secretary of State. The many existing instructions, and theiramendments, on the functioning of L.I.C.&apos;s should be scrapped, and a personal letter be sent to all Governors setting out revised principles, and providing a revisedsample pro-forma. The substance of this letter should be agreed with the J.I.C.The points it might cover are suggested in Appendix IV, to which is attached amodel basis for a report, which should be issued as a guide.67. Briefly, what is wrong with the existing &quot; intelligence &quot; reports is that theytend to be too much like Situation Reports, dealing with things that have happened,instead of being forward-looking documents, dealing with what looks likehappening next, and drawing the necessary conclusions. This has, of course, been largely because those responsible for their production were primarily interestedin political reporting, and not in the collection, appreciation and use of securityintelligence. It is almost impossible to draw a hard line between political and security intelligence material, and it is indeed the duty of Governors to combinethe two in a balanced appreciation. The two streams should, as recommended inthe Colonial Office paper (Gen. 485/5) be joined together as close to the source aspossible; the security intelligence, provided by whatever source, should beconsidered in the light of the political intelligence provided by the representative ofthe Secretariat, or the Labour Department, or whatever it may be. But there shouldbe a clear distinction between reports which are primarily political and those whichare primarily &quot; intelligence.&quot; At present the &quot; Intelligence Report &quot; is more oftenthan not a &quot; political monthly summary &quot;; this is indeed in some cases what theL.I.C. have been told to produce. This is wrong. The L.I.C. product should befirst and foremost an intelligence document; it should be kept quite separate from,any monthly political summary the Governor may be called on to produce. TheLLC. report should be written for;, and received by, the new IntelligenceDepartment of the Colonial Office (paragraphs 74-80); the political report would continue to be received by the geographical departments; each would of course becopied to the other Department.\
II. The Receiving End(1) The Colonial Office: an Intelligence Department74. The steps which have been taken to improve the quality and quantity of intelligence will be useless unless corresponding steps are taken to ensure that it isgiven the best possible treatment at the receiving end. Here, I submit, two things are called for a change of emphasis, and a corresponding change in organisation.75. The change in emphasis is a matter of inducing at home the sort of&quot; intelligence-mindedness&quot; which I hope will follow the changes to be madeabroad. How this can best be done I hesitate to suggest; possibly an office circulardrawing attention to the subject would be effective.76. The change in organisation is a great deal easier to recommend. It isthat the subject of intelligence be given the machine to deal with it which its importance undoubtedly deserves. It is remarkable that the whole business of intelligence throughout all 40 territories concerned is dealt with, in the ColonialOffice, by one official serving in the Defence and General Department, apart ofcourse from the normal work of the geographical departments. A properIntelligence Department is, I submit, an urgent and vital requirement. This neednot be as large or as elaborate as, for example, the corresponding organisation inthe Foreign Office (the P.U.S.D.) though some expansions would be necessary.x77. Its functions should, I suggest, cover the following subjects: liaison with S.I.A. and his Assistants; Liaison with J.I.C., J.I.S., J.I.B., M.I.5., M.I.6. andthe Intelligence Directorates of the Service Ministries; Intelligence Reports;Security.78. These duties could probably be covered by the Head of the department and an Assistant, or maybe two. They are at present the responsibility of theDefence Department (except Security, which belongs, in so far as it belongs68. Although the L.I.C. has no responsibility for political reporting, theSpecial Branch must necessarily maintain a close watch on the activities of politicalorganisations, since, in the colonial context, these are frequently targets forpenetration by Communists or by extremists who intend to achieve their objectivesby methods other than constitutional.69. The material contained in the intelligence report often top secret would of course be drawn upon by the Governor for his political report. If any reference to sources was necessary, it would be dealt with in a separate personal letter to the new Intelligence Department in the Colonial Office.Recommendations70. (i) That a personal letter explaining how L.I.C.&apos;s should function be sentto all Governors by the Secretary of State, making the points in Appendix IV.(ii) That L.I.C. reports be kept separate from routine political reports, andbe addressed to the Intelligence Department of the Colonial Office.(5) Special Branch Administration71. The administrative needs of the Special Branch require special treatment.They do not respond to the set establishments and precedents of a Police Force or government Office. They are accordingly not always easy to fit into the acceptedpicture, and consequently tend to be treated with lack of understanding.72. A case in point is that of Special Branch registries. This is a small matter which, if put right, would have a considerable effect on the intelligence machine.Since the proper collation of intelligence must be based on an efficient registry and records system, continuity in registry direction is essential. It will only be practicable if at least the senior posts in Special Branch registries are madepensionable.Recommendation73. That the administrative needs of Special Branch be given a higher priority, and that, in particular, the senior posts in Special Branch registries bemade pensionable.
Defence Department      Intelligence Department        Police Department       General Department(if still necessary)79. Departmental organisation is of course a domestic matter on which Iwould not presume to offer advice, but the existence of a separate IntelligenceDepartment would I am sure make the whole difference to the success or failureof the other recommendations in this report. Intelligence is not, I repeat, a part-time subject, to be fitted in with a lot of other work. Recognition of this principlemust be translated into practice in London, as in the field.Recommendations80. (a) That suitable steps be taken to induce &quot; intelligence-mindedness.&quot;(b) That an Intelligence Department be set up in the Colonial Office.(2) The J.I.C.81. It is significant that neither in the LLC. Charter (D.O. (48) 21), nor inthe discussions connected with its production early in 1948, nor in the Evill Reporton Intelligence of 6th November, 1947, was there any mention of colonial territories or the Colonial Office, which was not then represented on the LLC.The Charter was issued under the authority of the then Foreign Secretary and minister of Defence. In the autumn of 1948 Mr. Bevin sent the Prime minister a minute which is worth quoting in full:  &quot; As you know, it is my belief that our Colonial territories are likelyto be one of the principal objectives of Communist attack in the near future.With this in mind it seems to me very important that we should do everything possible to ensure that we have the best possible intelligence about Communistactivity in the Colonies, so that we may not be taken unawares.As a first step towards this I suggest that the Colonial Office might consider appointing a permanent member of the J.I.C., so that the ColonialOffice would remain in constant touch with the intelligence picture as a whole and with the development of Communism throughout the world, in so faras it is known to our intelligence organisation. I am sure that such an appointment would be of great value not only to the Colonial Office but tothe other departments represented on the LLC.&quot;82. The Prime Minister invited the Colonial Office to appoint a representative to the LLC, who took his seat on 8th October, 1948. No change was made in the charter or in the issuing authorities, who remained the Foreign Secretary and minister of Defence only.83. 1 In these circumstances the LLC. have suggested that it would materiallyassist the Colonial Office to play a full part in the work of the LLC. and to giveeffect to the objects for which a representative of the Colonial Office was invitedto join the LLC., if the present Charter were withdrawn and re-issued under theauthority of the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Defence and the colonial secretary. &apos;84.  The advantages of this would, in the opinion of the J.I.C., be asfollows:  (a) to place the Colonial Secretary in the same position as the other two ministers as regards calling on the LLC. to prepare intelligenceestimates, &amp;c, within its terms of reference;(b) to record formally that the LLC. has a responsibility under its Charterfor intelligence and security in the colonial territories;(c) to enable the J.I.C. more easily to ask for information, advice and assistancefrom the Colonial Office in the same way as it at present does fromthe Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and the service departments;anywhere, to the Establishment Department; see paragraph 91). The new set-upmight be on these lines:  assistant under-Secretary
3S2.(3) Intelligence Votes87. Behind this organisation, the P.U.S. at the Colonial Office, should, i submit, take his place with those of the Home Office and other Departments, whenfinancial questions are under discussion. Such participation would, as in otherexamples, benefit not only the Colonial Office but also the other members of theCommittee.Recommendation88. That the Colonial Office be suitably represented in the handling of the intelligence Votes.(4) The Security Service89. At present the Security Service does not actually operate, but only assistsand advises, in Colonial territories. I am satisfied that this relationship is the correct one, and that no organisational change here is called for. But I should emphasise that in this, as in any other similar relationship, there must be a strongreciprocal element; the Colonial Office must keep the Security Service fully informed, and consult it so far as is practicable, if the machine is to work smoothly.Fortunately, this is generally recognised; the point might however be worth makingformally by the Secretary of State.Recommendation90. That the need for reciprocal consultation between Colonial Office and security Service be made clear.(5) Protective Security and &quot; Vetting &quot;91. The responsibility for advising both the Secretary of State and colonial governors on protective security rests with the Chief Security Officer, (C.S.O.)Colonial Office, Major-General Dunlop, who acts through the EstablishmentsDepartments, the Overseas Service Department, and maybe the geographicaldepartment concerned. There is a Departmental Security Officer, who acts as his deputy in matters concerning the security of documents, but who is not qualified to deal with security reports or service officers. The C.S.O.&apos;s duties involveinspection of colonial premises and also the vetting of colonial personnel.(d) to encourage and facilitate closer association and exchanges in the fieldscovered by the terms of reference between the Colonial Office and thecolonial territories on the one hand and the other departmentsrepresented on the J.I.C. on the other;(e) to enable the J.I.C. to present to the Chiefs of Staff and to Ministers properintelligence appreciations on the colonial territories, both individually and within the general framework of the threats posed to them by russian and Chinese imperialism, Communism, nationalism, racialism,&amp;c, and to perform as regards those territories the functions withwhich it is charged at present in respect of intelligence and security in other territories.85. In general, the change would, in my opinion, symbolise the close workingwith J.I.C. which would be made possible by the institution of the IntelligenceDepartment. The Colonial Office representative would be able, with the improvedorganisation behind him, to take a more active part in the Committee&apos;sdeliberations, and generally to make a more valuable contribution. There wouldalso be a permament instead of a part-time Colonial Office representative on theJ.I.S. who would busy himself not only with imparting information on colonial territories, but with absorbing information about world affairs in general andCommunism in particular.Recommendation86. (a) That the J.I.C. Charter be withdrawn and reissued jointly by theForeign Secretary, Minister of Defence and Colonial Secretary.(b) That there be a permanent Colonial Office representative on J.I.S. aswell as J.I.C.
92. In the first place, the proper parent body for the C.S.O. is clearly the intelligence Department; arrangements could be made for access to EstablishmentDepartment files when necessary for the vetting side of his work.93. Secondly, he should have a deputy who can perform all his functions.At present, when he is away on tour there is no continuity.94. Thirdly, arrangements should be made for ensuring that protectivesecurity is adequately dealt with in the field during the long periods betweeninspections. This could be achieved by (a) ensuring that Special Branches, where these exist, have adequate staff todischarge their responsibility for protective security.(b) arranging for an annual review of protective security measures in eachColonial territory.95. Since the maintenance of adequate security necessitates constant vigilance,a periodic review of protective security would be of considerable value to theColonial administration. Such a review might appropriately be carried out by asub-committee of the Local Intelligence Committee, under the chairmanship ofthe Security Service Representative where one exists. The report would then besubmitted to the Governor who would forward a copy to the Colonial Office.96. Suggested headings, as used by the Security Service for appreciations ofthis type, are given in a form at Appendix V.Recommendations97. (a) That the C.S.O. be made responsible to the Intelligence Department.(b) That a Deputy C.S.O. be appointed.(c) That annual Protective Security Reviews be undertaken by an L.I.C.sub-committee under the S.S.R.(6) Cypher Security98. Top Secret cyphers held by Colonial Governors can, if compromised,imperil the whole imperial cypher system. This is reason enough for the ColonialOffice to take all possible steps to ensure that the security of such cyphers is rigidlypreserved.Recommendation99. That Governors be instructed to observe the strictest precautionsregarding the custody and security of cyphers, in accordance with &quot; CO. Cypherand Code Instructions &quot;; and that Deputy S.I.A.&apos;s be charged with reporting onthe observances of these instructions.III. After Independence100. Although I have no specific recommendation to make on this aspect Iwould suggest that our aim should be to induce newly independent territories tokeep on our S.S.R.&apos;s as the nucleus of an efficient organisation. Future Nkrumahsshould react well to the explanation that this is what has been done by, e.g.,Australia and India.
POLICE&quot; Taking one consideration with another,A policeman&apos;s lot is not a happy one.&quot; Pirates of Penzance.A.-GENERAL101. Second only to a sound intelligence system, our next most importantdefensive weapon in the cold war in the colonies is an efficient police force. the vital importance of the police is realised quickly enough once an emergency hasstarted; but in time of &quot; peace &quot; it tends to be a Cinderella, neglected in favour ofsuch more attractive and popular sisters as Health and Welfare, or the revenue-earning Departments. It is always tempting to invest in social services at theexpense of the police, in the hope that the former will make the latter superfluous;but this is a short-sighted and dangerous proceeding. The recommendations Ihave to make are designed to correct the balance. They will cost money, but this must, as in the case of intelligence, be regarded as the premium to be paid for insurance. The total bill under &quot; Police &quot; in round figures might be  225,000 capital and  50,000 recurrent (see Chapter V, Finance).102. The recommendations fall roughly into two categories a change in colonial Office organisation, and improvements in existing systems. I regard thefirst as essential if the second are to be realised. Some of these improvements havealready been recommended, in various previous reports. The reason that general improvement has not gone forward faster than it has and though a great deal has undoubtedly been done, a great deal still remains is in my opinion due to a basicdefect in the organisation, namely the absence of a Police Department in theColonial Office. If this is put right, the recommendations on training, conditionsof service and so forth should follow without much difficulty.B.-ORGANISATION(1) A Police Department103. At present, police matters are handled at the administrative level by the geographical departments and by one official in the Defence and GeneralDepartment, whose other duties include:  Liaison with the Chiefs of Staff, Joint Planning Staff and service ministries;Colonial defence policy;defence aspects of constitutional development;agreements with foreign powers on defence matters; and the colonial forces.At the advisory level, there are the Inspector-General and his Deputy, one ofwhom is usually abroad, and neither of whom has any powers other than advisory;they are assisted by one lady clerk, and have no clerical staff.104. For example, a report by the Inspector-General on the police of a territory is dealt with, at present, as follows. One copy he leaves with the Governor,the other he sends to the Colonial Office. This is registered and filed with the geographical Department concerned, and circulated to the Defence Department.When it returns to the geographical Department, the Governor is asked for hiscomments. The average time which elapsed between the last Inspection and the governors&apos; comments was seven months; five colonies took over a year; two havehot yet commented on a 1952 inspection. If and when received, the comments are circulated again by the geographical Departments, first to the Police Advisers, then to the Defence Department, and finally back to the geographical Departmentwhere action should in theory be taken. But in the course of this leisurely processmuch momentum has been lost, and the parties primarily concerned in seeing that something gets done the police, advisers are hampered partly by their repeatedabsences and partly because they have no real powers and no real control over thewanderings of the papers.
(2) Re-in forcing the Inspectorate111. Next to improving the machinery in the Office, a strengthening of the inspector is in my view essential. A past Inspector-General has expressed theview that frequent visiting was essential if colonial forces were to be kept up tothe mark; the constant pinging of a mosquito was a proved anti-soporific. Toenable inspection and, even more, important, checks on progress to take placemore frequently, I recommend that two additional Deputy Inspectors-General beappointed, making three in all. For the reason stated in paragraph 49, these should not be regional, but should depend directly from the Inspector-General inLondon. Their appointment might be reviewed in say three years&apos; time; if by then the house had clearly been put in order, the posts could be reduced orabolished.112. I do not agree with the present system under which the existing DeputyInspector-General is chosen from among retired Colonial Police Officers.  He105. I am certain that what is wanted to remedy this state of affairs is an active instrument concerned exclusively with police affairs, and I have come tothe conclusion that this could best be provided by a Police Department in theColonial Office, such as exists in the Home Office. (Its functions would of course be different, since it would have no ultimate sanction, like the 50 per cent, grant toprovincial forces, to enforce its views on colonial territories.)106. Its chief tasks would be to exercise an active central direction of policeaffairs: to stimulate a similar activity in colonial governments; to see that action ispromptly taken to implement the recommendations of the Inspectors-General (whohave no authority to do so themselves); and generally to fight the battles of thepolice with an enthusiasm and authority which are inevitably lacking in the set-upas it is today. In the event of an emergency appearing imminent, or occurring, itwould be able to take the necessary police measures at this end without theconfusion and delay which is otherwise liable to occur. It would not deal with either personnel or procurement. Nor would it, of course, administer the police,any more than the geographical Departments administer internal politics.107. I do not presume to lay down exactly how such a. department should be constituted. It should have the same status as any other subject department e.g.,Defence or Information entitled to correspond with Governors. Its head wouldbe a civil servant, in the ordinary way; not a policeman. The Police Advisers andthe Inspectorate would remain as they are, advisers, with access to the Secretaryof State. The important thing is that police papers would be registered with it,and that it would consequently be responsible for action on police affairs.108. The Colonial Office object to the establishment of such a department on principle, since (I quote from the paper submitted to me) &quot; it would be a mistake to take so important a matter as police away from the main Colonial Officemachinery (viz., each geographical Department in association with Oversea ServiceDivision) and centralise it in a specialised department.&quot; I do not follow this. Thereare twenty-two subject departments in the Colonial Office, including those ofDefence, Information, International Relations, and Economics. Are these subjectsso unimportant that they can safely be taken away from the geographical Depart-ments? Or is it suggested that police matters are so well handled by the geographical Departments that they do not need a special department, though&quot;Students &quot; do? In fact, the geographical Departments, no doubt owing to thenatural pressure of their other work, have allowed police matters to fall into astate of arrears which show conclusively that a change is called for. The case of cyprus (see paragraphs 331 to 332) is the worst example. I could quote many others, if space permitted; but I will limit myself to the case of housing(paragraphs 144 to 149); this has for years been recognised as a matter of thegreatest urgency, and yet in April 1955 the Governors had not been sent theinstructions which should have ensued from a report of September 1954.109. That a Police Department is a prime necessity I am absolutelyconvinced; I do not find the arguments against it in any way impressive.Recommendation110. 1 The establishment of a Police Department in the Colonial Office.
(and in future the other two whom I recommend) should be chosen from amongthe up and coming Colonial Police Officers who in due course will be selected to command the most important Colonial Police forces.Recommendation113. That two additional Deputy Inspectors-General be appointed from among serving Colonial Police officers.(3) Recruitment of Officers114. Candidates for gazetted ranks (cadets) are recruited by the ColonialOffice, while those for the European Inspectorates are recruited by the Crown agents for the Colonies. The standard of the latter is, understandably, lower than thatof the former. Consequently, in those territories (Hong Kong, Nyasaland,Northern Rhodesia, Kenya and, till recently, Uganda) where there is a largeestablishment of European Inspectors from whom gazetted officers are promoted,the standard of these officers is lower than that of officers recruited as cadets. Also,a gazetted officer who becomes one by way of the Inspectorate can never reallycatch up on the training he would have had if he had entered as a cadet.115. It is tempting to conclude that recruiting should be in the hands of oneagency instead of two. But so long as the demand exceeds the supply, the only result might well be to reduce the standard to the lowest common denominator.116. The object of ensuring that cadet material is not wasted on the inspector could, instead, be achieved if the Colonial Office representative on theCrown Agents Board were to insist, when such material came before the CrownAgents Board, on its being directed to the Colonial Office Board. (Responsibilityfor this at present rests with the Crown Agents.)Recommendation117. That the Colonial Office Police representative should direct candidates for the Inspectorate, who are clearly more suitable for gazetted rank, to theColonial Office Board.C-TRAINING(1) Present Facilities118. Cadets (Assistant Superintendents) and Inspectors recruited in theUnited Kingdom get thirteen weeks basic police training at a United Kingdomtraining centre for constables. In the case of cadets this training is followed bya four months course at Hendon Police College under the supervision of a ColonialPolice Officer.119. A small proportion of non-gazetted officers (normally locally enlisted)earmarked for promotion to gazetted rank, are sent to the United Kingdom for a four months&apos; course at Hendon and a three weeks&apos; attachment to County forces.120. When the gazetted recruit arrives in his territory he gets a period oftraining which varies in the different territories, but does not exceed three months.The object is for him to get to know the local police and learn local laws and customs. &quot; Training Schools &quot; (more properly &quot; recruit depots &quot;) exist in all the bigger territories and most of the smaller, and are used for this purpose.121., Advanced training is obtainable at Ryton Police College (designedprimarily for the. United Kingdom police). There are, each year, four SeniorCourses of three months, on each of which the Colonial territories have ten places,and two Junior Courses of six months on each of which they have twenty places.122. Specialist courses (C.I.D. work, finger-prints, etc.) are also available inthe United Kingdom.123. The facilities outlined above mark a great advance over the position fiveyears ago, on which all concerned are to be congratulated. But there is still muchto be done. In Kenya some officers have been taken in without any training inthe United Kingdom at all. The period of training, particularly that on arrival ina territory, is far too short, by any standard. A month or two is no time in which to learn the language, laws, traditions and customs of a country before being sent out as a police officer. Nor is the training given in the local training establish-ments, where they exist, always sufficiently intensive. This is where there is often jthe greatest need for improvement.
124. Here I should say a word for the excellent police training college whichhas recently been established, at a capital cost of about  150,000, in Uganda. Ifevery colony could produce an equally efficient institution, where non-gazettedranks could receive advanced training, an enormous step forward would have beentaken. But the need for regional training colleges, where officers and officermaterial could be properly trained, remains of course undiminished (cf., Appendix I(a) and (b)).(2) Regional Training Colleges125. The obvious difficulty is that an area such as Nyasaland, which onlyhas thirty-three officers, is clearly not in a position to build, equip and staff a competent training college, in the proper sense of the word. The obvious remedyis regionalisation. But here there is another equally obvious difficulty in Africa,namely, local jealousies. Nevertheless, it is my considered opinion that regionaltraining colleges are the only answer, and that the political difficulties must some-how be overcome. So must the financial difficulties; a rough guess is that thetotal capital expenditure involved would be  219,000, and recurrent expenditure 34,000. (See Appendix I.) I would hope that Her Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe prepared to contribute, at least, to the former.126. The lines on which these regional colleges should be established are setout in some detail in Appendix I. There would be five in all: Far Eastern (already existing, in some respects, in Malaya), East African, Central African, West african and West Indian.Recommendation127. Regional training colleges should be established in the above-mentionedfive areas; Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared to help not only withstaff but with the initial capital expenditure.(3) Extension of Facilities at Ryton128. The Police College at Ryton, though primarily a domestic institution,takes about seventy Colonial police officers a year. Since much of the ordinaryinstruction given would be of no interest to them, they are detached from suchcourses and trained, in the time so made available, by a Director of Colonial PoliceStudents. If this Director had an assistant, he would be able to cover much moreground.129. While the existing &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; courses cater very well for the needsof the junior and senior ranks respectively, up to that of Superintendent, there is a need for a short &quot; C &quot; course, to train not more than twelve officers at a time, ofthe rank of Superintendent and above, for the wider responsibility of forcecommand. An outline of such a course is attached as Appendix III.130. I have considered the possibility of establishing a separate &quot; ColonialWing &quot; at Ryton, but have come to the conclusion that this would be a mistake,since much of the benefit derived from these courses is that the atmosphere andbackground are essentially British.Recommendation131. That an Assistant be appointed to the Director of Colonial Studies atRyton; and that a further course for command level training be instituted.(4) Training and Leave132. At present training at Rytqn counts against home leave. This is generallyadmitted to be unjust and unsound; but Colonial Governments are said to be unwilling to let men go for the long periods which would otherwise be involved.This seems a case for strong representations on the short-sightedness of such a view.Recommendation133. That the Colonial Office make strong efforts to get training at Rytonconsidered as outside leave.
(5) Police Boys Brigade134. More should be done to &quot; catch them young.&quot; It is much quicker to gethold of a boy and train him to be a policeman than to wait for the educationalprocesses in Africa to turn one out. An excellent example of what could be doneexists in Liverpool, where boys are trained in police work from sixteen till their national Service; 90 per cent, of them go back to the police.Recommendation135.   Schools should be attached to police Recruit Depots.(6) Police Cadet Schools136. In Malaya a very successful Boys Company now exists where boysof potential army officer type are given a good secondary education, as a preliminary to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. A similar system might help to solve the problem of providing African officer material for the police, in areas(such as Kenya) where the normal territorial process of education would take too long to do so.137. The Cadet Schools, like the Boys Brigade, could be a part of theRecruit Depot.Recommendation138. That Governors be asked to consider the desirability of establishing suchCadet Schools in their territories.D.-CONDITIONS OF SERVICE(1) Insecurity and Promotion139. One of the strongest factors operating against the morale, and so theefficiency, of the Colonial Police to-day is the lack of security. The progress towards self-government of the territory in which an officer is serving may wellmean his own progress to unemployment. He sees his colleagues in, say, the Sudan,out of their jobs, and he wonders when his turn will come. Nor is he likely to be convinced by letters from West African Ministers to The Times; their intentionsto-day may be both admirable and sincere, but will they stand the test of time?It is one thing to hang on to one&apos;s European staff at the difficult time of transition,and quite another to keep them on when the hand-over has been tidily effectedand all is going smoothly. Faced with this dilemma, the best men may well decide to take a chance in the world outside the service, while they can, rather thanwait for the axe to fall when they have become less employable.140. If anything has been made clear to me in the course of this enquiry, it isthat the one thing which would immediately and immensely improve the morale,and so the efficiency, of the police force would be the creation of a real UnitedKingdom-based Commonwealth Service with real guarantees of security.Unfortunately, it has become equally clear to me that, whatever might have beenthe case ten years ago, such a step would to-day be politically anachronistic and practically impossible. And anything which falls short or providing copper-bottomed financial guarantees is worse than useless. I have, therefore, reluctantlyabandoned this line of thought, and concentrated on other aspects of the service which may be susceptible of improvement.141. After the cry for guarantees, the next most popular grievance seemsto be the difficulty of promotion through the considerable amount of dead woodat the top. This is, ironically enough, largely due to the operation of the &quot; forty-five-year retirement rule,&quot; and its variations, which was intended to remedy this verytrouble. By making retirement optional, the duds have been enabled to hang on for ever (short of scandalous behaviour), and this has so discouraged some of thebright young men that they have got out while the going was good. The ideal,from the point of view of the Service, would be to give the Colonial secretary the right to refuse permission to retire; but this would be obviously inequitable, andI fear impracticable. The only solution that I can see is for Governors to be urged,by the Secretary of State personally, to be courageous in their approach to theobviously inefficient.  Governors should be told, in terms, that they must cut out
3*52, zVmtheir own dead wood themselves, and not rely on transfers-still less, promotions to solve their personnel problems. Governors should also have impressed upon them the great importance of not &quot; establishing &quot; officers, who will then becomeimmovable, without the most careful consideration (one territory must, apparently,suffer as gladly as it can the presence, for the next twelve years, of a commissioner of Police whose incompetence is unquestioned).142. Although the &quot; forty-five-year rule &quot; has worked out in the opposite wayto that which was intended, and is consequently better allowed to die a naturaldeath, there is all the more reason why the existing &quot; fifty-year rule &quot; should berigidly enforced. An officer should only be kept on after fifty if there are reallystrong grounds for doing so; he should not be kept on as a matter of course, orgiven the benefit of the doubt if his retention is a border-line case.Recommendation143. That Governors be urged to be ruthless in their treatment of obvious&quot; dead wood &quot;; and to observe, in the absence of very strong reasons to thecontrary, the rule of retirement at fifty.(2) Quarters144. The crying need for improved quarters has been a constanty recurringfeature of previous reports. There is no field in which action is more urgently necessary. Adequate housing is essential to morale; if the police of British Guianahad been decently housed, in accordance with the Inspector General&apos;srecommendations, they would in all probability not have fallen victims to dr. Jagan. Last September a Working Party on the Colonial Police made thefollowing recommendation:&quot; We therefore recommend that consideration should be given to theprovision of assistance to Colonial Governments in this [i.e. the housing] field, incases where it was proved to the satisfaction of Her Majesty&apos;s Government thatthe Colonies concerned could not afford to meet the cost from their own resourceswithout drastic interference with their accepted development aims.&quot;145. Following presentation of the Working Party&apos;s report, the questionwhether approval could be given to such United Kingdom financial assistance, andif so whether it should come from funds already available under the colonial development and Welfare Acts or from the Colonial Services Vote, was consideredfirst in the Colonial Office and subsequently between the Colonial Office and theTreasury. The Treasury had only taken part in the Working Party subject to astipulation that they were not thereby in any way committed to eventual agreement that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should provide any part of the funds needed.146. The Treasury view of the recommendations, as indicated orally inNovember 1954 and subsequently (after some misunderstanding) clarified in writingin February 1955, is that police are the responsibility of the Colonial Governmentlike all other branches of administration and that if a Colony cannot from its own resources maintain reasonable efficiency in its policy the Colony can be grant-aidedin the ordinary way. The Treasury realise that in individual Colonies there maybe political or other difficulties&apos; in persuading Legislatures to vote the necessary funds for the proper maintenance of internal security. Should such cases arise,they do not rule out the possibility that in the last resort, all other methods havingfailed, they might have to consider a special financial grant for the purpose. Butthe Treasury take the view that such cases must be dealt with ad hoc, and theyare not prepared for any suggestion to be made to the Colonies at this stage that united Kingdom financial assistance might be available for the police in any other way than through the normal grant-in-aid procedure to which there would ofcourse be strong political and other objections from the Colonies concerned, sincethe procedure involves Treasury control of a Colonial Government^ expenditure.147. Acceptance of the Treasury ruling by the Colonial Office removed thepossibility of offering Colonial Governments a financial inducement or of writing to them in terms which, however indirectly, invited them to submit a case for united Kingdom financial assistance. Consideration has therefore since beengiven to drafting communications (which require individual treatment) to certainselected Colonial Governments, repeating the Secretary of State&apos;s general concern
that police housing should be adequate and asking for information on progress interms consistent with the above. Agreement on the terms of these communicationshas just been reached with the Treasury.148. So, eight months after the need for assistance in providing housing wasofficially recognised, and years after it became apparent, the first step towards doingsomething about it has, as this enquiry ends, at last been taken. It is difficult tobelieve that such a vital matter could not have been more expeditiously handled,had there been the will and the machinery to do so.Recommendation149. That the question of police housing receive more energetic and urgentattention.(3) Pay150. To go into detailed recommendations on pay is beyond the scope ofthis report. I will only say that, as a source of grievance, it can, generally, beranked below insecurity, in the case of officers, and housing, in the case of men.151. In general, I disagree with the Colonial Office view that the police shouldnot receive more favourable treatment than any other class of Governmentservant. I agree with Conclusion 3 of the 1951 Ryton Conference, the first two paragraphs of which read as follows:  &quot; The Conference discussed the position of Colonial Police Forces within themachinery of Government and their relationship to other departments. they considered that while the Police Force is an essential organ of the centralGovernment, it is, at the same time, not simply a department on the same footing as any other department of the Administration.Colonial Police Forces, unlike other departments, are established byOrdinances laying down their powers and functions, and requiring their members to take an oath of office. Members of the Police Forces are not liable to inter-departmental transfer as are other servants of the Administration. They haveparticularly onerous responsibilities in relation to the maintenance of law andorder. Their duties are also such as to impose on them certain restrictions which do not exist in other employments, and to deny them many normal contacts in thecommunity. In these ways their position is distinct from that of any other membersof the Government Services and for that reason they need terms and conditionscommensurate with their special position and peculiar responsibilities, in respectof which they are subject to a rigid disciplinary code.&quot;152. The territories where poor pay has the worst effect on morale areGambia, British Guiana, British Honduras, Leeward and Windward Islands, andSeychelles. These are poor territories, and the problem may be insoluble (but seeunder &quot; Trouble Spots,&quot; paragraphs 350 (b), for British Guiana). Other territories which could, and should, afford better pay are Mauritius and Bermuda.153. It is impossible to overstress the importance of providing a salary forthe Chief Officer of Police, even of a small force, which will enable the appointmentof a man of high quality and fit to command.Recommendation154. That Governors be directed to look again at the problem of pay in theabove-mentioned territories.(4) Shorter Leaves and Tours155. It has long been recognised in the Colonial Office that a system of longtours, followed by long leaves, is extravagant of man-power, owing to the highleave reserve necessary, and in the highest degree, inimical to efficiency, owing tothe perpetual transfers it involves. The objections which have hitherto prevented the establishment of short tours are the extra expense to the Government of airtravel, and the extra expense to the officer of the more frequent moves. these considerations have led to short tours being rejected on most of the various occasions when they have been tried out.
3S2.2vE. WORK(1) Rural Policing158. The essence of good relations between police and public is routinecontact, in other words, patrolling. The exclusion of the central police from theKikuyu Reserve was a costly mistake. Yet there are still vast areas, notably inNorthern Nigeria, where the central police do not penetrate. The same applies to most of the Sierra Leone Protectorate, much of Gambia, and parts of northern rhodesia and Tanganyika. These areas may be policed, after a fashion, by theNative Administration Police (see below), who administer tribal law, work to thetribal courts, and are responsible to the local administration, not to theCommissioner of Police.159. It is clearly desirable, in the first place, that the central police shallbe enabled to penetrate as widely as possible, and so gradually take over from theN.A.P. This means better transport, and even more important, bettercommunications. Three men in a jeep, with good wireless contact with their headquarters, is the ideal.Recommendation160. That Governors be urged to give a higher priority to police transport and communications, so that rural patrolling may be intensified.(2) The Native Administration Police161. The existence of an independent police force, administering a difficultlaw and responsible to a different authority, is naturally repugnant to an orderlymind. But it would be a mistake, in the interests of tidiness, to try to integrate,at a stroke of the pen, the N.A.P. into the police proper. During the presenttransition process they have their role to play; and the arguments for leaving themresponsible to the local administration seem stronger than those for making themresponsible to the police.162. The first essential is not so much to alter the status of the N.A.P. asto ensure that they are better trained, equipped, and disciplined. For this purpose suggest that the police should now be given direct administrative responsibilityfor the N.A.P., i.e., be responsible for their training, equipment and discipline, butthat theyi should remain for the present under the executive authority of the nativecourts and the local administration. This arrangement would suit the transitionstage; in due course, as the. N.A.P. developed into a well-organised body, andtribal custom gave way to statute law, they would be assimilated altogether intothe central police.Recommendation163. That in backward areas the N.A.P. should remain, at present, underthe ultimate executive authority of the local administration; but that the centralpolice should henceforth be responsible for their administration, i.e., training,equipment and discipline, with assimilation into the central police as the objective.(3) AMcanisation164. (Asianisation is not in this context a problem owing to the comparativelyhigh state of development of Asian police material.) The problem extendswell beyond my terms of reference, but is inescapable. It is of course oneof pace; that Africanisation is the goal is common ground. I will only make twogeneral points.  The first is that &quot; Kenya-itis &quot; is probably the most dangerous156. This appears to be a case for another approach to local governments.The 1954 Commission, while recognising the unwisdom of long tours, felt unableto make any positive recommendation in favour of short ones. A clearer lead,with a restatement of the case for maintaining efficiency at the present time, might produce results.Recommendation157.  That the Colonial Office urge, in stronger terms, the desirability of shortf tours, and investigate the question of some form of &quot; short leave allowance.&quot;
35 2.7V iF.-RELATIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE CIVIL POWER173. Although I have no real recommendation to make on this vexedquestion, some reference to it seems called for. It is a subject on which feeling is strong, and on which there is a great deal to be said for both points of view. Theissue, which has come to a head in Kenya, is whether the administration can, for reasons of policy, without enabling legislation, interfere with the police in theexecution of their duty. For example, a Police Superintendent wishes to arresta member of the Home Guard who has murdered a Mau Mau; the District Officerinfluence at work in Africa today; it is certainly more dangerous than Communism.The second is that Africanisation, without education, is not enough; an untrainedAfrican official will probably be a nuisance, and may be a menace, to his fellows.165. The chief practical form, so far as the police are concerned, in whichthe racial problem arises, is this: is it so important to get the Africans capable of running their police when the time comes for them to do so, that their promotionshould be accelerated at the expense of white officers? In other words, should there be a colour bar in reverse?166. It has been represented to me that in the Gold Coast, where the problem is naturally most urgent, any such &quot; unfair &quot; promotion would lead to all thewhite officers resigning in a body. Even the expedient of putting a supernumeraryAfrican alongside the European whom he would ultimately replace had to be abandoned owing to the ill-feeling it caused. But nevertheless, in my view, the answer should be &quot; yes &quot;.Recommendation167. Where practicable, and in carefully selected cases, there should be no hesitation on grounds of principle in operating a colour bar in reverse, to favourrapid promotion of Africans.(4) The Police after Hand-over168. A police force is a powerful instrument for good or evil. It will always be a source of temptation to a Minister enjoying his first taste of power. It isalso a natural target for corruption. How to safeguard a force after hand-overis therefore a vitally important problem. It is unfortunately correspondingly hard to solve.169. The first essential is that any safeguards which may be devised shallbe incorporated into the machinery as early as possible, so that when the day ofself-government comes they are well-established and, it is to be hoped, respected.170. As to what these safeguards should be, the system now operating inthe Gold Coast seems as good as any. There the Government have set up a police council, consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Defence, LocalGovernment and Police, to advise the Minister on matters of police policy as wellas on conditions of service and pay. Such a Council would be intended to serve as a brake on any dictatorial tendencies on the part of a Minister. He would haveto dissolve it, and this might not prove easy.171. In addition to this Council, there is a Public Service Commission, whichcontrols promotions, &amp;c, in all branches of the administration, including thePolice. The Commission consists of two Englishmen and two Africans, all retiredofficials with no other duties. It would seem to provide as good a guarantee ofimpartiality as is likely to be found, though a separate Police Commission mightbe preferable. There is the obvious objection that, ideally, promotions should besolely decided by the Commissioner, and cannot be satisfactorily handled by aCommittee; but, in hard fact, it is better that they should be handled by aCommittee whose integrity is reasonably likely rather than by an individual who may be subject to severe temptations.Recommendation172. That Governors whose territories are approaching self-government beasked to consider instituting, as soon as possible, safeguards on the lines of those now operating in the Gold Coast.
332.-ZI/MG.-CONCLUSION ON POLICE177. If the above recommendations can be implemented and this should notbe impossible much will have been done to ensure not only that law and order ispreserved, but, even more important, that when a colony&apos;s hour for self-governmentarrives, it will have at its disposal the most precious asset we can give it a competent police force. 352z32CHAPTER IIIARMED FORCESWhy, now thou hast unwished five thousand men,Which likes me better than to wish us one.&quot;-King Henry V, Act IV, Sc. 3.Introduction178. The last time that a comprehensive review of the Colonial forces tookplace was in 1949. That review was written against the background of the secondworld war and at a time when fears of a third war were prominent in the mindsboth of Ministers and of the Chiefs of Staff.179. Now that the chance of a third war has receded and with the practicalcertainty that we have ahead of us many years of cold war, during whichthe Colonies and dependent territories will form one of the main battle fields, itnas become apparent that the whole matter should be reviewed afresh in the lightof our new strategy. Furthermore, the rapid political progress towards self-government which has taken place in many of the Colonies since 1949, and the factthat the cost of the existing Colonial forces (and for that matter all others) as atpresent established has greatly increased of recent years, are added and urgentreasons why the whole matter requires review. Whether the cost of these forcesis borne by the territories themselves or paid for partly by the War Office or bVthe Colonial Services Vote, the urgent necessity must be that we get the best valuefor the money available.180. There has undoubtedly for some time been a feeling in the ColonialOffice-and probably in certain Colonial Governments-that these Governmentswere paying in part for certain military requirements which should more properlybe borne by the War Department in respect of imperial commitments The WarOffice have hotly denied this. Whatever the facts may be here, there is no denyingthe other major source of trouble, namely, the fact that the bill for the internalsecurity element of the African forces has risen by leaps and bounds, without thosewho are asked to pay it having any sav in determining the&apos; size of the bill or anycontrol over the expenditure itself. The 1949-50 settlement, which never envisagedmovements of cost of the kind which have in fact occurred, has in practice brokendown for this reason.181. These two factors have engendered considerable friction on the onehand between the Colonial Office and the War Office, and on the other handbetween the Colonial Office and the Colonial Governments concerned, who are thepeople who to a considerable extent have to pay the piper. I think&apos;it importantthat the causes of friction should as far as possible be removed. My recommenda-tions are designed to that end. I would like to think that they will lead to morefriendly relations between the three parties concerned. If the War Office havebeen thought to have been too interested in retaining control of certain Colonialforces, the argument would apply almost entirely to the African colonies. It shouldbe appreciated that the British officer has a great affection for the African soldierand rightly or wrongly has tried to do his best for him according to his lights.182. I propose to tackle this part of my report under the following mainheadings: -(a) The role of the Colonial territories and the troops required to carry outthat role.(b) The control of expenditure.(c) The control of administration.id) Other bones of contention.(e) Recommendations for the various groups into which the territorieslogically fall.(/) The provision of officers.(?) The command structure in Africa.183. I have no recommendation to make in respect of Colonial Navalforces T do not think that any changes are necessary, or that any matters otimportance are at issue.33184. As regards Colonial Air Forces, there is one matter which obviouslyrequires fresh examination-the Auxiliary Air Force squadrons in the Federationof Malaya and Singapore. As this matter is already under examination betweenthe Colonial Office and the Air Ministry, I make no further reference to it inthis report.1. The Role of the Colonial Territories in War(a) The Need for a Re-Appraisal185. In February, 1955, the Oversea Defence Committee Secretariat, as aroutine matter, produced a re-draft (O.D.C. (53) 3) of the existing paper on thissubject.186. To my mind this did not fit the bill, as it did not sufficiently take intoaccount present-day conditions, and it seemed desirable that the role of theColonial forces should be reassessed in the light of the latest appreciations of thenature of a future war, and of the United Kingdom defence policy. The relevantfactors as represented by the Colonial Office are as follows: -(a) A global war against the Communist powers in which nuclear weaponswere used would presumably be decided within a short period and inthe metropolitan theatres; that is to say before the Colonial forcescould be attacked in their own home territories (with the possibleexception of local fighting in Malaya), or could have had time to bebuilt up or brought into action elsewhere. The concept of reserves ofman-power being gradually brought into play, which underlies the1949 decision about African forces, seems thus to be rapidly becomingout of date.(b) For the same reasons of time and space, the maintenance of Colonialforces cannot contribute appreciably to the deterrents against aglobal war.(c) Most important Colonial areas are too remote from Communist territory(with the exception of Malaya and Hong Kong) to be threatened byfurther limited non-nuclear &quot; aggressions by proxy &quot; on the Koreanmodel. Theoretically, they could raise forces for service in limitedwars away from home (there is an East African battalion serving inMalaya now); but the nearer they approach independence the morepolitically difficult this will become.(d) Certain Colonies can look forward to achieving full self-government inthe fairly near future; but the possession of weak conventional forces(which is the most which those territories could maintain) is in themodern world no longer an effective guarantee of independence. Smallcountries can only safeguard themselves from external dangers byjoining larger combinations (such as the Commonwealth) includingGreat Powers who possess the decisive modern weapons; and themilitary contribution which the smaller &quot; non-nuclear &quot; countries canmake to such combinations seems to be progressively diminishing.Hence it is apparently less necessary than in the past to endow aterritory with considerable indigenous military forces as part of theprocess of preparing it for self-government.187. I agree in general with these arguments, except in two respects, firstlythat (a) does not disprove the desirability of certain Colonial forces being madeavailable for service in the Middle East as and when possible; and secondly, (d) doesnot adequately cover the case of Malaya. Perhaps it was not intended to. Thesetwo points are dealt with later in this report.(6) The Chiefs of Staff New Appraisal188. Accordingly, I asked that the whole matter of the role of the coloniesm war be looked at again by the Chiefs of Staff. They reported in C.O.S. (55) 42 f 25th February, 1955, with the following conclusions: -&quot; (a) The role of the Colonies in war should be-(i) to provide for their internal security;(ii) to provide, as far as possible, for their own local defence;47969 says such action would be politically disastrous. The police view is that the lawsays murderers must be arrested, and that short of legislation nobody can stop thepolice from doing their duty. The administration view is that the ultimate responsibility for law and order is theirs, that the police are their instrument, andthat in an emergency expediency must sometimes prevail over legality.174. The real point is that in many parts of Africa law and order havehitherto been administered by the District Officer, very efficiently, on &quot; Sanders ofthe River &quot; lines. With the improvement in communications, the spread of the( police force over the country and the loss of the magisterial function by theAdministration Officer as District Magistrate, this kind of authority is graduallydying away. The future lies with the police. But they are not yet altogether readyto assume their responsibilities, and meanwhile it would be folly to uproot theexisting system.175. It is worth remembering that the dualism which has led to so muchtrouble in Kenya existed perfectly happily in India, where the DistrictSuperintendent of Police was clearly subordinate to the Administrative Officer asMagistrate. The latter, for example, authorised the opening of fire (Punjab PoliceRules, Chapter XIV, paragraph 56). It also exists in Malaya, where the policehave been able to take over control at all levels.Recommendation176. This is a matter calling not for pronouncements of constitutionalprinciples, but for the practice of compromise and common sense.
2,51 2V(iii) to provide for Commonwealth land, sea and air forces suchinstallations as are necessary to facilitate their strategicemployment;(iv) to provide reserves of man-power on which we can draw after thefirst phase of nuclear war to sustain whatever operations arenecessary;(v) to provide such industrial and material resources as can be developed.&quot;189. In the body of the paper they pointed out that in the case of the Army,the assessments in the draft O.D.C. paper were still valid with the exception of the african Colonies, and that in their case the requirements were now for one infantry brigade for operational employment in the Middle East from each of East and west Africa as soon as practicable after the outbreak of war. It was hoped thatthis would be within six months.190. An agreed interpretation, dealing with the only outside requirements inthe event of global war, was subsequently issued, and worded as follows:  &quot; 1. The requirement is for a Brigade Headquarters and Brigade Signal section and three Infantry Battalions from each of East and West Africa. Theremay be a subsequent requirement but no cognizance need be taken of it until after the outbreak of war.2. The Brigade Headquarters and Signal Sections and Infantry Battalions willbe accepted on the internal security organisation and scale of equipmentdecided upon in peace-time in the territories concerned.3. It is hoped that they may be despatched to the Middle East as soon aspracticable after the outbreak of war, but this decision will rest withthe Governor concerned in the light of the internal security and politicalsituation at the time.4. No accompanying administrative units need be maintained for these forcesin the territories concerned.5. Any additional equipment required and the necessary administrative backingfor a war role will be provided in the Middle East theatre as a WarOffice responsibility.6. Similarly, any additional training to fit them for their war role will becarried out in the Middle East theatre.&quot;191. Since this wording was agreed upon, I have thought it right to includesmall transport, medical, ordnance and repair units in each of the two infantry brigades.192. These will allow each Brigade to be reasonably self-supporting andwill give it some mobility. The total administrative personnel required for eachBrigade is 7 officers, 12 British other ranks and 150 local other ranks, with only62 vehicles.193. West African administrative units are on a station basis and therefore not mobilisable in present shape. The same situation exists in East Africa, thoughsince the Mau Mau rebellion started, the original static administration units have become to some extent merged in reinforcing administrative units from the UnitedKingdom and it is therefore difficult to say exactly what the situation is today. Itwill be necessary to make a plan for the removal of these few administrative units from the static set up before they are required in the Middle East in war; but thenumbers involved are so small that they should present no problem.(c) The New Scale194. To sum up, the Chiefs of Staff have decided that internal security shouldbe the new role for the Colonial forces. The next step was to establish the numberof units required for that role. (I deal only with the regular forces of the importantColonies and territories, since anything else does not appreciably affect the problem.)The Colonial Office has agreed to the following scale:  East Africa 5 to 5\ Battalions (after the Mau Mau rebellion has been put down).
.     West Africa 9 Battalions (plus two equivalent infantry Battalions from the static andtraining organisation).Somaliland 1 Battalion.Caribbean 2 Battalions.Federation of Malaya 12 Battalions by 1962 (see paragraph 259 later).Singapore 1 Battalion.UD The New Organisation and Equipment195. Having now established the role and the number of major units requiredfor internal security purposes, I caused to be examined in the War Office the outlineorganisation and equipment of the forces required, in the light of the experience gained in the past including Malaya and Kenya, though in both of these countries the troops are doing considerably more than normal internal security duties.196. There are certain basic requirements necessary to meet both internal security duties and if it comes to that the local defence of frontiers against borderraiding. These may be summarised as the maximum number of lightly equippedRifle Company personnel, good communications and a sufficiency of transport togive the necessary mobility. No heavy support weapons are required, and sothere is no need for the Support Company in a Battalion. There may be differences in the requirements of the different territories, which would be reflected in the equipment of units, but in general terms they must all be capable of maintainingsupply and communications over wide areas of broken country where few roadsor communications exist.(e) The Resultant Savings197. All this will have to be gone into in great detail between the ColonialOffice, the War Office and the territory concerned. All I can do in this report isto indicate the order of the financial and man-power savings which would result.Though my terms of reference do not direct me to produce any such savings, Ihave thought it proper to try to do so, particularly as some of my recommendationsunder police and intelligence mean money, whether found by the colonial government concerned or by the United Kingdom.198. I take the case of the four West African territories and the three in east Africa.(i) West Africa199. The present order of Battle comprises 9 Infantry Battalions andand 1 independent Infantry Company, 2 Field Artillery Batteries, 2 Field EngineerSquadrons and 3 Signal Squadrons. I propose that the Infantry and Signals bereduced to an internal security basis and that the Artillery and Engineer units be abolished or converted.   This would produce an approximate saving as follows:  200. From a preliminary examination of the administrative units it isestimated that on this basis it would be possible to effect an overall saving ofapproximately 25 per cent, in British and locally-enlisted personnel and vehicles in these Units, if the above reductions are carried out. Having effected these reductions, it will still be possible to produce for internal security purposes the equivalent of two additional Infantry Battalions from the remaining administrative and training units, even at the new reduced scale.British Officers    ......British other ranksLocally-enlisted other ranksVehicles   ...50 per cent.50 per cent.25 per cent.40 per cent.479.69F 2
201. If the above is translated into terms of man-power and money, it would eventually produce the following savings:  Man-powerBritish officers    ............... r British other ranks        ...............Locally-enlisted other ranks     ............Vehicles    .....................        j8UM0Xeria                        ............ LOSofoOOnrfrlr^t                                               ... 780,000Gold Coast ................ ? SO 000Sierre Leone.................. ?nmnGambia ......... ^Total     ..................     2,100,000202. These figures have been broken down by territories on the assumptionthat the savings would be proportional to the cost at present attributable to each,and this is probably not very far out. The figures must in any case be regardedas E. and O.E. I have not attempted to work out where this saving of  2 -1 million would fall, as between various United Kingdom votes, but on this basis the wholesum would be saved by the United Kingdom as opposed to the territories concerned.203. However, it is not as easy as all that, and it will be some time beforethe full savings are effected.204. To take one example alone, the proposal means the reduction of british officers per Battalion from the present number to nine, their places being filled by African officers. This process will take a little time, and I make certain recommendations on this subject later in my report.205. I have attempted to split the overall figures of savings down into thoserealisable in the near future and those which are somewhat longer term, and the answer looks like this:  Near Future206.  1-5 million would be the saving in a normal year after the man-power, &amp;c, reductions have been put into effect. This saving would not, however,actually be achieved within a year of the decision being taken because reduction in numbers could only be effected over a period, and expenditure in terminal benefits,repatriation of United Kingdom personnel, &amp;c, must be met.Longer Term207.   A further  0-6 million, making  2-1 million in all.(ii) East Africa208. I have not found it possible to forecast the savings which would accruein the near future, once it becomes possible to proceed with the reductions I have recommended, for the reason that the time factor governing the replacement ofBritish by African officers cannot at present be estimated.209. The eventual savings, however, for the East African forces would be 980,000, all of which would be a saving to United Kingdom funds.2. The Control of Expenditure(a) The Present System210. Two functions are in question financial responsibility and financial control.211. Financial Responsibility means the obligation to provide the funds tomeet all required expenditure as and when it arises. To-day the ultimate financial responsibility for the cost of the East and West African and West Indies Forcesrests on the War Office. The financial responsibility of the East and West african territories is to provide annually a certain sum towards this cost.  In addition, the
Colonial Office (through the Colonial Services Vote) provides a further sum whichvaries from time to time. All expenditure in excess of that covered by the territorial and Colonial Office contributions rests on Army funds.212. Financial Control means the power to decide how much shall be spent onany Service and in what way; together with the machinery for watching expenditurein order to ensure that any such decision is not departed from without the approvalof the appropriate controlling authority. In the case of the East and West african and West Indies Forces, financial control is in the hands of the War Office with allthe usual safeguards for expenditure of Army funds. The Army account, however,does not enable the actual expenditure on these forces to be isolated, and theexpenditure can never be precisely known so long as it is sunk in Army expendituregenerally. Though this does not weaken the actual financial control of day-to-dayexpenditure by normal Army financial methods, it obviously produces a very unsatisfactory situation, both for the Colonial Office and for the territory in question.The contributions from the territories and from the Colonial Office which providethe cash or part of it, are assessed on an agreed basis in the light of the cost estimated by the War Office. The capitation basis is the best method the War Office has of arriving at the average rate of expenditure at any moment. It follows that at atime of rising prices, pay or wages, the calculations of cost will always be on thelow side, e.g., the capitation rates used to estimate costs in 1955-56 are calculatedabout October, 1954, on data relating to an earlier period.213. No one would deny that the present system of holding periodicalconferences to settle the financial contributions of the various parties is most unsatisfactory and takes place in an atmosphere of mutual irritation.214. Undoubtedly, from many points of view the War Office have had the worse of it all round. They have often borne more than their strict share of thecost of these forces, and at the same time have become the object of a good dealof suspicion and ill-will. Negotiating methods fail from the Colonial Office orterritorial point of view to explain in any satisfactory detail why costs have increasedso much. The War Office reply that these are the best figures they can give, unless they are completely to reorganise their whole method of accounting for the british army. However this may be, the fact remains that the greater part of the costof the East and West African Forces (the only ones which really matter in this argument) is properly regarded as &quot; internal security&quot; and hence a localresponsibility. But control rests with the War Office, who thus say what is to be spent, without having to find the greater part of the money. Those who do or atany rate on whom the primary liability rests-have no share in the process of votingestimates; they have no opportunity to say &quot; stop this is too much. In thecircumstances we can get better value for money by dealing with internal security in some other way perhaps by putting greater emphasis on the police.&quot; They mayof course say this, but they can do nothing about it,(b) The Need for a Change215. I consider the case for a change has been well summarised inparagraphs 16 and 17 of GEN. 485/12 of 22nd February, 1955, which read asfollows:  &quot; 16. The financial system in operation for the African forces, and for others administered or proposed to be administered by the War Office, has proved in practice to be increasingly unrealistic and productive of friction.It is the War Office, as the administering authority, who must decide how much is to be spent and on what things; Colonial Legislatures are thus requestedannually to vote money to recoup expenditure already decided on, over whichthey have no control, and in respect of which the War Office have hithertofound it difficult to furnish detailed information. Thus control of expenditure is remote from those who are expected to meet most of the bill. It is common ground between Departments in London that Colonial Governments shouldbe urged to take over full financial responsibility for the local forces as soonas they can. But with the development of elected Legislatures in the Coloniesit will be politically impracticable to achieve this without conceding to them atthe same time a large measure of control over the expenditure. NoLegislature can be expected indefinitely to pay the piper unless it can call thetune. The difficulty of making effective concessions in this direction so long asthe forces remain under War Office control has led to friction with Colonial
252 z.xGovernments and to part of the &quot; colonial &quot; share of the cost of the forcescoming back on Her Majesty&apos;s Government through the Colonial ServicesVote to perhaps a greater extent than would be otherwise necessary.Consultative machinery which has recently been devised for some areas seems unlikely to do more than patch over the difficulties.17. As well as the difficulties over political and financial relations withColonial Governments to which the present system increasingly gives rise, it also has the weakness that the essential purpose which budgetary control should play in any financial system is in fact frustrated. There is in practiceno point at which the necessity for expenditure in relation to the real needscan be scrutinised before commitments are incurred, because those who draw up the estimates are not responsible for finding most of the money, and thosewho are asked to find the money are not shown the estimates in sufficient detailor at an early enough stage to influence them. The cost of the forces is risingalarmingly and a halt must be called. Budgetary control is, as in the UnitedKingdom, the natural and most suitable instrument.&quot;216. Obviously some change is necessary. It is, however, quite impracticable to introduce one umbrella decision which will cover all the various territories concerned. The system in force must vary in accordance with the conditions in thevarious territories.217. My recommendations are given in sub-section 5 below which deals with both financial and administrative control and responsibility under a series ofgroup headings.3. The Control of Administration(a) The Present System218. The function in question is administrative control. This means theday-to-day administration in all matters involved in running the armed forces,e.g., the maintenance of personnel records, of accounts, &amp;c, ensuring that supplies and stores are available where they are needed, the consideration of changes inestablishments, scales, diets, &amp;c, to meet changing needs and habits, makingnecessary arrangements for movement whether local or out of the Command, the supervision of depots, workshops, transport companies, educational establishments,the maintenance of accommodation, including furnishings and the designing, sitingand building of new accommodation.219. The Army system maintains a general control by the War Office of allthese things and in some cases, e.g., rates of pay, a detailed control while leaving the general day-to-day management to local Commanders. Under this system the local Commander is generally responsible for ensuring the maintenance of necessary stocks of supplies, stores, vehicles, &amp;c, and apart from local purchase,he relies on the War Office or the appropriate Army installations in the UnitedKingdom to meet his indents without undue delay. The whole home organisation is designed to ensure that there are adequate supplies and stores, &amp;c, availablein the United Kingdom to meet demands from Commands all over the world.220. If this system of Army administration were replaced by local administration, then it would be necessary for each territory to establish stocks,together with a procurement machine which would ensure that orders forreplacements were placed in time to be delivered before they were needed. Beingpart of a large organisation, like the War Office machine, enables Commands to rely on a steady flow of nearly everything they require, whereas local administration would involve the placing of separate and comparatively small orders with theappropriate civilian firms, through some central agency in London. The chances of delay in the ordering and delivery machinery would be considerably greater.(b) The Colonial Office Case for a Change221. The Colonial Office would like to see this system replaced as before1939 by local administration. Their case is stated in paragraphs 12 and 13 ofGen. 485/12 of 22nd February, 1955, which reads as follows:-&quot; 12. With internal security as virtually the only role of the colonial forces, and increased emphasis on Colonial self-help in that field, the factors which led to the forces themselves being for the most part administered and.
352 &apos;2x4. Other Bones of Contention225. There are two other matters which give rise to friction out of allimportance to the amount of money involved defence contributions and militarylands.(a) Defence Contributions226. The current doctrine is that Colonies may be asked to pay or to volunteer some contribution, but they may not be compelled to do so. This must obviously be correct, since in the last resort the use of reserve powers in a matter ofthis kind is quite unthinkable. The War Office certainly agree to this, but a processof dunning goes on which probably does more harm to relations with the Coloniesthan it does good to Her Majesty&apos;s Governments finances. The War Office is of controlled directly by the United Kingdom Government (through the WarOffice), no longer hold good. While British Army advice and assistance willcontinue to be needed for officering and training and generally on thetechnical level, internal security is a civil government responsibility which theWar Office and G.O.C.&apos;s in C. overseas are not designed to discharge; and itwould be more in accordance with the normal principles of British colonial administration if the administrative control and policy direction of theColonial forces were devolved on to Colonial Governments. Such a transferwould not of course impair the ultimate authority of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment over the forces so long as each territory remains dependent on her majesty&apos;s Government, but Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ oversight over theforces would be exercised through the Secretary of State for the Colonies.This would restore the pre-war position.13. The argument for such a change is reinforced in the case of thoseColonies which are already constitutionally far advanced and can look forward to full self-government (it is to be hoped, within the Commonwealth) withinthe measurable future. It is obvious that a new country, on attainingindependence, must be prepared to maintain and control its own armed forces;this is a natural and proper consequence of their progressive assumption ofresponsibility for internal security. It would be inefficient and productive of friction to retain the forces under direct United Kingdom control until thelast moment, and then improvise a rapid handover. Transfer of control of theforces to Colonial Governments, at the stage when those Governments arestill under the influence and ultimate authority of Her Majesty&apos;s government through the reserved powers of the Governors, seems the best way of makingthe transition, and of paving the way for a fruitful future collaboration with united Kingdom influence replacing United Kingdom control.&quot;(c) Comment222. I do not entirely agree with the reasoning of paragraph 12 quoted above.Nobody has ever doubted that internal security is a civil government responsibility,and nobody has ever suggested to my knowledge, that any G.O.C. in C. in East orWest Africa should take over responsibility for internal security. The G.O.C. in C.is charged with advising Governors of the territories regarding the military measures necessary to support the civil power in the event of the trouble becomingtoo much for the civil power to handle. What we are discussing is the military administration of the forces and not their ultimate administrative control or theirpolicy direction.223. It seems to me obvious, however, that it should be agreed in principlethat the administration of Colonial forces by the War Office must eventually bebrought to an end and replaced by administration by Colonial Governments. Butthis principle equally obviously cannot be applied simultaneously over the wholefield. The pace must be dictated by local circumstances. I give my recommendations later.224. Finally, under this subject, I have considered whether administrativecontrol on the one hand and financial control and responsibility on the other mightbe partly or wholly divorced from each other. I think it is certain thatunsatisfactory results would in practice flow from any such system. It might possibly be made to work, with real goodwill, but 1 am afraid that the history ofthis argument over recent years would preclude this.
362     i ii40 ^course an interested party, since all defence contributions are credited to WarOffice funds and not to the Treasury, and so it is very natural that the War office should strive by every means to get as much as they can.227. The Treasury on the other hand, though hardly soft, see things in the round and they relate this problem to the wider picture of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ total financial relationship with the Colonies and take into accountsuch matters as the indirect contributions made to the economy of the UnitedKingdom by, e.g., Malaya or the Gold Coast dollar earnings, all of which are relevant.228. It seems to me that the idea behind Colonial defence contributions is a sound one. The children who are out in the world and earning money may beexpected to contribute to the well-being of the family as a whole. But it may wellbe that the method by which it has, up to now been the practice to ask forcontributions, has been unimaginative. A territory might well be more willing togive a certain sum for a specific purpose, as opposed to seeing their chequedisappear into the maw of the general account, so to speak.229.   I make no recommendation on this matter, but merely draw attentionto it as a cause of friction.(b) Military Lands230. This whole problem is bedevilled by a long history which is both obscureand contentious. The issues involved are incapable of clear summary, but what happens in practice is that there is great difficulty and bad feeling both about theterms on which lands are made available for military purposes and about the termson which they are surrendered when no longer required. It is alleged that theWar Office have demanded  100,000 for the return to a Colonial Government ofa title to land which the War Office have not used for 30 years, and whichwas made available to them gratis over a century ago. Whether this is factuallycorrect is not important. It is an example of the type of argument which persists.An attempt to rationalise this whole business has been on the stocks for more than three years at the instance of the Singapore Government, where the matter isacute. Little, if any, progress has been made. The trouble seems to be thatthe two parties concerned, the War Office and Singapore Government, cannotnegotiate directly. What seems to be necessary is that either the War office should delegate more power to the local Commander-in-Chief, or that the singapore Government should delegate more power to the Colonial Office. AllI would plead is that there be an injunction to settle these problems soon on theofficial level, failing which the whole matter should be put to Ministers within areasonable time. I suggest six months.5. Recommendations for the various groups into which the Colonial Territorieslogically fallCategory I:   Territories which can be Ignored because the local administration is Incapable of Assuming Responsibility231. (This is the wording which has been used in this context by the ColonialOffice. I do not entirely agree with it since I do not believe that there is any territory which is not capable of handling its own Q.M.G. services withoutWar Office assistance should this be politically or militarily desirable. ByQ.M.G. services I mean all matters of procurement, housing, clothing, feedingand movements. It would be highly desirable that general staff matters, suchas training and operations, should be continued to be guided by the localCommander-in-Chief.)232. In any case there are only four territories possessing regular forces which come into this category:  (a) Somaliland233. The War Office are quite willing to hand over all matters of procui-ementto the Somaliland administration, and I recommend that this be done. the somali land Scouts are a small and efficient force. I consider that no harmwhatsoever would come to them if all procurement, &amp;c, matters were handledfor them by the administration in the same way as used to be in force in theSudan Defence Force.
352 zx(b) Aden234. The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs visited Aden and the WesternProtectorate in January of this year and as a result made various recommendations on the scale and nature of the forces required, after consultation with the governor and the A.O.C.235. He concluded his report by saying that in his view these questionswarranted a special enquiry and that the question of whether the forces in Adenshould continue to be an R.A.F. responsibility should not be excluded, particularly as we are obviously precluded on political grounds from using the air in the most effective way against the Yemen.236. As this matter is now under discussion between the Minister of defence and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, I have not considered it in this report.I only mention it here as it is a matter which is outstanding.(c) Sierra Leone and Gambia237.   I deal with these under Category IV.Category II: The Caribbean238. The problem here centres round the West India Regiment. This is along and complicated story, the details of which I have relegated to Appendix VI.Briefly, proposals for the re-formation of the West India Regiment have beenunder consideration for some years, the object being to establish a force of two battalions in the Caribbean which would be adequate to meet local internal security requirements and eventually permit the United Kingdom troops at present in that area to be withdrawn. In October 1954 definite proposals were put before all theWest Indian Governments, who were asked whether they would accept the financial commitment; whether they agreed that the War Office should be asked to startraising the Regiment; and whether they agreed to the necessary legislation being introduced in the United Kingdom Parliament.239. No official replies have been received to this despatch, but present indications are that British Honduras and British Guiana, the two mainlandterritories, will stay out of the scheme initially. The others will probably play.The only thing to do is to make a start without the mainland territories and hopethat they will change their minds later.240.  Recommendations(a) The maximum pressure should be exerted on the Island Governments andLegislatures in order to obtain their earliest agreement to the re-formation of the regiment;(b) Planning should proceed on the assumption that British Guiana and british honduras will participate in the scheme.(c) The Governments and Legislatures of British Guiana and British Hondurasbe urged, in the strongest terms, to secure their participation as early as possible.(d) The Location of the Regiment as set out in Appendix VI be accepted for planning purposes.Category III: The Anti-Aircraft and Coast Artillery Defence of defended ports or Islands, i.e., Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Singapore, HongKong241. I have not considered in any detail the requirement for Anti-aircraft and Coast Artillery units in individual Colonial territories since the world-widerequirement for such units is under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff. I have noted, however, that the Chiefs of Staff have confirmed (CCS. (55) 44) a continuing need to provide conventional A.A. defences at those ports and basesoverseas where the threat is likely to be from conventional rather than nuclearattack.242. Units from the United Kingdom are not now available for the defenceof Colonial ports and bases, nor is it likely that they could be on the spot in timeto be effective even if they were available. The most practical and at the sametime the most economic means of providing the necessary defences is clearlythrough locally enlisted units on a territorial basis.  Certain of such units already
exist, e.g., the Royal Malta Artillery, and might well be expanded to provide themeasure of defence considered necessary. I doubt if sufficient suitable man-powerexists in Gibraltar.243. It seems unlikely, however, that all such units could reasonably beregarded as a financial commitment of the Colonies concerned. The bases and installations for which defence is required are for imperial use, any threat existslargely because of such imperial use, and it can certainly be argued therefore thatthe cost of their defence is an imperial responsibility. On the other hand, coloniessuch as Hong Kong and Singapore might well be persuaded to make some contribution towards their anti-aircraft and coast defence on the grounds that theirmercantile harbours and trade will receive incidental protection from such defences.Recommendation244. Locally enlisted units on a territorial basis; the cost to be an imperialresponsibility, but colonies to be invited to contribute.Category IV: West Africa(a) Gold Coast245. The requirement is for the existing 3 Battalions but on a newestablishment. One Field Battery and the one Field Company can be abolishedor converted, since they are neither required for internal security duties nor essential for the West African contribution in the Middle East in the event of global war.If the Colony wishes to keep them it must pay for them. I do not think that theirabolition or converson would have any serious effect on morale.246. The Gold Coast will, as far as can be foreseen, achieve self-governmenton 1st January, 1957. Financial and administrative responsibility for the forces must be handed over to them before that date in order to allow for a running-in period. During that period the responsibility will rest with the Governor andnot with Gold Coast Ministers.247. The aim in the Gold Coast is to achieve self-government not later thanthe 1st January, 1957, but present indications are that this target date may be too optimistic. Full responsibility for the Gold Coast forces should be handed overto the Gold Coast Government before that date in order to allow for a running-in period. During the period preceding independence, control of and responsibilityfor these forces would under the present Constitution rest with the Governor andnot with Gold Coast Ministers, though the Gold Coast Legislature would of course have the responsibility of voting military expenditure.248. The Colonial Office and the War Office have recently agreed on the1st July, 1956, as the date to recommend to Ministers for the hand-over. It is mostimportant that an early Ministerial decision should be reached on this point inorder to enable detailed planning to proceed as quickly as possible, with the aim of ensuring a smooth hand-over to the Gold Coast Government.Recommendations249. (i) 1 Field Battery and 1 Field Coy. to be abolished or converted.(ii) Planning for hand-over of financial and administrative responsibility toproceed as quickly as possible.(b) Federation of Nigeria250. The requirement is for the existing five battalions but on a newestablishment. There is some question that a sixth battalion will one day berequired to allow for a decrease in inter-territorial availability of the three gold coast Battalions. In any case it is not necessary to plan for it at this stage.The existing Field Battery and Field Squadron should be abolished or converted,since, as in the case of the Gold Coast, they are not required for internal security duties, nor are they essential for the West African contribution in the middle east in the event of global war.251. The future of the Nigerian forces is inevitably bound up with the wholeconstitutional and political future of the country, which is due to be reviewed at a conference to be held not later than August 1956.  The political problem is,
very briefly, how to hold the Nigerian Federation together in spite of the strongseparatist elements at work within it. It is arguable that if the armed forces were to be handed over to the Federation soon, regions would find it harder to lay hands on them, and so wreck federation, than they would when theirpretensions were further advanced. For example, the fact that the police arefirmly in Federal hands makes it possible to resist the attempts of the North to setup a regional police force. On the other hand, it can be argued that so longas the armed forces are under War Office control, defence is less likely tobe a bone of contention with the separatists; it can be represented to them as a subject beyond the present capabilities of any Nigerian; moreover, the armed forces are less likely to be the object of envy if responsibility for them lies notin Lagos but in Whitehall.252. I incline to a middle view, and recommend that the Nigerians should be told, now, that they could if they so wished, take over control of their armed forces in July 1957; this not by any means to imply that July 1957 was the targetdate for independence, which was a separate issue altogether. I have in factselected this date as being a year after the hand-over in the Gold Coast. But theNigerians could be told that it represented our estimate of the time when theyshould, if all goes well, be capable of accepting responsibility for their armed forces.Recommendations253. (i) 1 Field Battery and 1 Field Squadron to be abolished or converted,(ii) The Nigerian Government to be told, now, that they could takeover control of their armed forces in July, 1957.(c) Sierra Leone and Gambia254. These present a very small problem, having 1 infantry battalion and 1infantry company respectively. The pattern will emerge once the plan for Nigeriahas been decided upon. Until Nigeria achieves self-government, the future G.O.C.Nigeria should, if politically possible, command such troops as there are in sierra leone and Gambia. After that date, it may well be that an O.C. Troops sierra leone and Gambia will have to depend directly on the War Office.Recommendation255.   This will depend on what happens in Nigeria.Category V: Present Areas of Conflict(a) Federation of Malaya and Singapore256. The present situation as regards the financing and administration of thelocal forces in Malaya is satisfactory and is briefly as follows:  257. The War Department has assumed responsibility for the maintenance ofall the regular Federation forces, with certain minor exceptions. These forces are maintained in the same way as the British units in Malaya. The cost is recovered from the Federation on a per capita charge, based on the initial cost of the article,depreciation, wastage rates and cost of maintenance. This rate is agreed betweenthe Command Secretary FARELF and the Federation, and is subject to periodicalreview.258. There is no question to my mind of recommending any alterations to thissystem while the emergency continues. If it comes to that, the system is workingwell and I am doubtful whether any change is even desirable.259. There is however one aspect to which I would like to draw attention.All political parties in that country reckon on getting their independence within five years or less. The Government has frequently stated that the suppression ofthe emergency and the improvement of relationships between the varyingcommunities are prerequisites to self-government. Few people really believe thatthe necessary harmony can be produced within five years. Nevertheless, I would say that the various political leaders probably consider that their thesis of independence within five years is tacitly accepted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.The existing local armed forces are quite insufficient to compete with the dangers which would arise after the granting of self-government and perhaps after theremoval of British troops. It is probable that the armed forces required would cost something in the nature of  20 million a year, while as far as I know, the local47969
defence budget could not exceed something in the nature of  5 million a year. If,therefore, the Federation is granted self-government, with only the armed forces for which it can afford to pay, there is to my mind, a strong probability that aperiod of chaos will be followed by Communism. Alternatively, a very considerableannual contribution will one day be necessary to enable the requisite armed forces to be maintained.260. No long-term plan has yet been made and I consider that the matter should be tackled as one of urgency. The eventual armed forces will require to beofficered by Asians. These Asians must be trained. They are unlikely to wish tobecome officers until they can see that there is an assured plan for their future.Today there is no such plan for the forces which I believe will eventually berequired and so we are in a vicious circle.261. In view of the importance of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore,both strategically and financially, I consider this whole complicated problem should be tackled as a matter of urgency.Recommendation262. No change necessary now, but the long term problem should be tackledurgently.(b) Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda263. At present these territories find seven Battalions. The eventualrequirement is for five or five and a half, though in all three territories it mayconceivably be possible, in due course, to reduce this somewhat.264. Until the Mau Mau rebellion has been put down, it is to my mind quiteout of the question to perform any surgical operation on the local forces, or in anyway to interfere with the existing system of administration. This view is acceptedboth by the Colonial Office and the War Office.265. In spite of this something must be done in order to settle existingdisputes. There is on the part of Tanganyika and Uganda a growing dissatisfaction with the present system, and a decision in principle, to transfer the administrationof their forces to them in the course of time, would I believe help to discourageany idea on the part of these two territories to &quot; contract out &quot; of an East Africanregional defence organisation.  It is most important that they should not do so.266. As I have said before, no one would deny that the basis worked outin 1949 has in practice broken down. It is not reasonable to expect the War Officeto have to justify their annual estimates in detail to local legislatures, even if that were technically possible, which I am assured it is not. The Colonial Office accept this and I agree with them. On the other hand, we cannot expect these legislaturesmeekly to vote even larger sums, year by year, with only comparatively generalexplanations of the causes. The latest costing figures produced by the War office for the East African territories covering the year 1955-56 appear to me to becast in a form which should be acceptable, and the Colonial Office agree. Theproof of the pudding, however, is in the eating, and it is as yet too early to say whether these figures, in their new form, will satisfy the legislatures concerned.It may well be that they will not.267. The only system which would appear to have a chance of success wouldbe to limit the Colonial responsibility, not to a proportion of the total, whichfluctuates (always upwards) in an alarming and to them unacceptable manner,but to set out sums which would hold good over fairly long periods, of 3-5 years.At the end of the selected period, these sums would be reviewed and renegotiatedin the context of a review of the role and scale of the forces themselves. This would of course leave the United Kingdom holding the baby between reviews, but thisis in fact what to some extent is already happening, owing to the extreme difficultyof adjusting Colonial contributions upwards year by year.268. The Colonial Office view is that a conference of this type, if prefacedwith the knowledge that a decision in principle had been taken in due course,i.e., as soon as administratively possible after the putting down of the Mau Manrebellion, to restore administrative responsibility to local governments, would goquite well and might elicit from these governments greater contributions than ithas been possible to extract from them under present arrangements.
6. The Provision of Officers271. It is obvious that the efficiency and morale of the Colonial Forces must depend to a great extent on their officers, i.e., on the provision of the best possibleBritish officers and on the careful selection and training of an increasing numberof local men for training as officers.(a) The Provision of British Officers272. To-day the War Office is required to provide more than 1,700 officers for the Colonial Forces. I doubt if this heavy load is fully appreciated. this number represents about 5 per cent, of the total officer strength of the British army.It is nearly double what it was before the war, when the figure was 3 %.273. The Colonial Office consider that the prospects of attracting sufficientBritish officers of the right quality would be increased, if service with the colonial forces became, as it was before the war, more of a career and if it were possibleto offer fairly long term secondment free of United Kingdom income tax and with good local allowances. This is at present impossible in Colonial Forcesadministered by the War Office and paid for in the first instance out of UnitedKingdom funds.274. There are a variety of factors influencing the provision of sufficientvolunteers. Compared with the situation before 1939, there is a background ofinstability throughout the army although all possible measures are taken to reduceits impact on the individual. Practically the whole of the British army, apart fromthe training machine, is serving outside the United Kingdom, but with the formationof the hoped for Strategic Reserve between now and the middle of 1956, I believethat the number of volunteers for employment with Colonial Forces is likely toincrease appreciably.275. Then again, officers marry at an earlier age than was common in thepast, and this makes them reluctant to volunteer for service which involvesincreased instability through moves and possible separations.276. Young men to-day consider the career problems. Long service withColonial Forces is bound to have disadvantages which a good and ambitiousBritish army officer will take into account. A young officer to-day has to jump a succession of hurdles if he is to be satisfactorily placed, and have the necessarybackground by the time he becomes a commanding officer. Ideally, it is highly desirable that during his formative years he should do a period of secondment toColonial Forces, but as things stand to-day, there is no doubt that it is difficult to fit this in for the high-class young men.277. There will I am sure, always be some volunteers for short periods withthe Colonial Forces, though there will always be difficulty in obtaining volunteers269. I recommend that this be done in the case of Uganda and Tanganyika.I am not in favour of making a similar pronouncement in the case of Kenya asthe political future of that territory is so uncertain. There are two other factors which have influenced me in this opinion. Firstly, that the administrative backingfor any future reinforcements from the United Kingdom into East Africa, or from kenya to the other territories, must be provided from Kenya, and it seems to medangerous at this moment to take any step which might endanger the efficientfunctioning of that requirement. And secondly, that the detailed shape and size of the East African Forces with the administrative backing required is now understudy between the War Office and the G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa (under the LongShot II proposals), and I would not wish to pre-judge the issue in any way atthis stage.Recommendations270. (i) Number of battalions to be reduced from 7 to 5 or 5 .(ii) No change until Mau Mau rebellion put down.(iii) Governments of Uganda and Tanganyika to be told now that it has beendecided in principle to hand over as soon after this as practicable; no pronounce-ment in the case of Kenya.(iv) The financial responsibility of governments to be laid down for a periodof 3-5 years, and then reviewed.
for long periods of service. The real reason why an officer in the old days went to the Colonial Forces was that he was certain to get good sport, he hoped for thespice of adventure, and he was reasonably certain that he would carry out hisperiod of secondment in the company of other good officers. This was in fact agood basis on which to volunteer and one which no one would like to see changed.278. The Colonial Office are in favour of reverting to the contract system bywhich the Government concerned tries to produce financial and other conditionswhich will attract the type of officer that it wants. If contract terms are offered,then the officers so seconded are not subject to United Kingdom income tax, andthat, not unnaturally, is a considerable attraction. I do not think however thatthis would solve the problem to-day. Malaya went to contract terms about threeyears ago. As a result they got a better supply of better officers, but recently,perhaps because the shooting has largely ceased, the marked improvement both in quantity and quality of volunteers has fallen off considerably.279. But apart from that, there is one serious disadvantage of any system of contract. Officers cannot be compulsorily posted to serve on a contract, and theintroduction of such terms would in itself be no absolute guarantee that enoughvolunteers would come forward. If the contract terms fail to produce sufficientof the right type of officer, it would be impossible to post officers compulsorily tomeet what would presumably be the minimum requirement in the forces concerned.This seems to me to be an over-riding consideration, as our second state might be worse than the first.280. An even more difficult situation is likely to occur as and when these territories attain self-government. I am very doubtful whether under those conditions service with the local forces is likely to prove a popular career, whatever the financial terms of service. In spite of high rates of additional pay, the WarOffice have always had difficulty in meeting our commitments in India and pakistan, and has had to resort to compulsory posting.281. If I am right, then the solution must lie in the commissioning at anincreased speed of a greater number of local officers from the Colonial territoriesthemselves.Recommendations282. (i)  To increase the provision of local officers (see (b) below).(ii) Contract terms of service should only be adopted for those territoriesenjoying self-government.(hi) Every effort should continue to be made to get improved terms of service for British officers seconded to Colonial forces.(b) The Provision of Local Officers283. I believe that this problem has got to be tackled really seriously, notonly in order to ease the load on the British army, but in order to meet the politicalaspirations of the territories concerned.284. Probably the most important territory from this point of view is theFederation of Malaya where the situation to-day is not too bad, though it willrequire complete re-examination in the light of the recommendation which I makein paragraph 262. One hundred and thirty Asians have already been commissioned.There are to-day 43 cadets of the Federation Forces being trained at the RoyalMilitary Academy Sandhurst (for regular commissions) or at the Officer CadetSchool, Eaton Hall (for short service commissions). In the Federation itself thereare to-day 43 cadets under preliminary training, and a start has been made withthe planning and building of a small Federation Military College in Malaya. TheBoys Company of this college is already a good going concern and will produce,in the near future, a constant supply of boys to be trained as officers with thenecessary qualities of character and education. The college is designed to turnout fifty officers a year, after four years in the Boys&apos; Wing and two years in theCadet Wing. It is a comparatively simple matter to estimate the numbers required and the rate of training which must be attained. I deal below with the case of theWest African territories only. As I have already said, the situation is comparativelysatisfactory in Malaya, and in the East African territories it appears to me thatthere are to-day too many imponderables to enable a detailed plan to be made.The other territories concerned, including those in the Caribbean, are too smallseriously to affect the problem.
352. ^xv285. In West Africa, the nine battalions each require 19 African officers assoon as possible, i.e., a total of 171; 35 West Africans hold commissions to-dayThis leaves a deficiency of 136. Against this deficiency 19 are under training to-day at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, or at Eaton Hall.286. Even if young men of the right sort can be induced to present themselvesin sufficient numbers, it will not be possible to commission more than about 26 ayear, or the whole age structure of the future will be thrown wholly out of gear.This means that the process will take at least five years, at the end of which timeall battalions would be Africanised except for nine British Officers apiece.287. Where are these young men to be trained? There are now seven west african cadets at Sandhurst, out of a total of 853 cadets, of which no less than 107are non-British, and 12 West Africans at Eaton Hall, out of a total of about 500cadets, of which 29 are non-British. It seems to me that these numbers cannot be appreciably increased without a general lowering in the standard of efficiency ofthe British cadets, anyway at Sandhurst.288. Quite apart from the fact that Sandhurst is becoming overloaded with non-British cadets, it seems probable that fairly soon after self-government a territory may wish to train its own officers, but in no case, except Malaya, will theofficer cadre be large enough to warrant a military college to train its own young officers. The only sensible answer would be one military college for the whole ofthe African territories, but presumably this can be ruled out on political grounds.I see no answer to the problem, except that Africans continue to be trained atSandhurst. If this is right, then the argument should be explained to the Colonialpoliticians concerned. I think to-day that some of them are probably living in adream world. If for instance the Gold Coast, after self-government, were to insist on training its own young officers, then its minute &quot; army&quot; would quicklydisintegrate into a state of comparative inefficiency.289. To-day in Africa there is no tradition of officer service. The only possible short cut is through the establishment of Boys Companies, for which thematerial is carefully selected. In such companies the boys would receive fouryears&apos; education in English, and. what is equally important, in character andleadership training. Such Boys Companies now exist in Nigeria and the gold coast. It seems to me most important that similar companies should be started in East Africa, if we are ever to give East Africans a proper chance to wincommissions.Recommendation290. (i) A Boys Company in each of the East African territories.291. Various proposals have been considered in recent years for the granting of some form of Governors Commission, in addition to the Queen&apos;s Commission,in order to cater for the type of good African soldier whose educational standardsdebar his taking the course at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. On the short-term view it will be advantageous, without a doubt, to give commission of some sort to a certain number of these good &quot; old sweats.&quot; Since in the west african territories all the type in question, I am assured, speak English, there isno reason to my mind why they should not be trained at Eaton Hall and be givenshort-service Queen&apos;s Commissions. As things stand to-day, this whole matter is held up as between the Colonial Office and the War Office because of certainconstitutional or legal difficulties.292. Firstly, there is the difficulty of granting Queen&apos;s Commissions outsidethe British Army. Secondly, the problem that holders of local Commissions donot have powers of command over British troops, a difficulty which in my opinion is more apparent on paper than in practice. Thirdly, holders of local Commissionsare not liable for service outside the territory in which the Commission was granted, which seriously limits their effectiveness.293. There is to-day in East Africa a rank known as &quot; Warrant OfficerPlatoon Commander.&quot; The G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa, feels the first step should be to give these Africans some form of local Commission. They wouldthen live in a separate officers&apos; mess. I do not think that this would be politicallyacceptable to-day. Even if it was, it would not stay so. for long and I am,therefore, against it in spite of the fact that it would probably produce a larger number of so-called African Officers more quickly than any other method.
352 Z-X tyHowever, such is the urgency of making a start with the commissioning of africans in East Africa, that the matter might be investigated again with the governmentsconcerned.294. I am strongly against the granting of any Commission other than the queen&apos;s. It produces a lower level of officer, it makes necessary a separate officers&apos;mess, and is likely in my view to produce a lot of young men with chips on theirshoulders.Recommendation295. That only Queen&apos;s Commissions should be granted either regular orshort service and that this be agreed upon as quickly as possible between theColonial Office, the War Office and the territories.7. The Command Structure in Africa296. If my proposals prove acceptable, then it would at first sight appearthat considerable consequential savings should be possible in the whole Commandstructure. I am, however, doubtful whether this will in fact turn out to be the case.(a) West Africa297. It is obvious that a considerable re-orientation of the existing systemof command in West Africa will shortly be necessary on constitutional groundsalone. The matter has already been under examination for some time betweenthe War Office and G.O.C.-in-C, West Africa, and early this year the adjutant General to the Forces spent ten days on the West Coast and discussedinformally the problems of these four territories with the Governors and their staffs. The results of those discussions will now form the basis of the War Officeviews in the forthcoming talks with the Colonial Office.298. I do not consider that this problem comes within my terms of reference,but I feel that I must make some mention of it because of my recommendationselsewhere on the matter of the handing over of financial and administrative control.299. It is obvious that when the Gold Coast reaches self-government, it willbe politically impossible to retain a G.O.C.-in-C, West Africa, with the presentHeadquarters, West Africa Command. His place will be taken by a military adviser of some sort, with the requisite staff to co-ordinate organisation,equipment and training for all four territories. At that stage of the proceedings,the troops in the Gold Coast will be commanded by a G.O.C., Gold Coast (aseconded British Officer), responsible until the attainment of self-government tothe Governor, and subsequently to the Gold Coast Government. That much is clear.300. Elsewhere in this report (paragraph 253) I recommend that theFederation of Nigeria should be told, now, that they could if they so wished takeover the financial and administrative responsibility for their local forces in July,1957. They should at the same time be told that they must make up their mindwithin six months, as a period of 18 months will be required to bring about the considerable amount of reorganisation necessary. This reorganisation is not onlyin financial and administrative matters, but includes the eventual commandstructure in Nigeria and Sierra Leone and Gambia. A decision on this pointmust I think be taken before the end of 1955.Recommendation301. In view of the time necessary for reorganisation, Nigeria to be toldnow to decide within six months whether to take over in July 1957 (see para. 253).(b) East Africa302. It is as yet premature to consider this matter in the East african territories. The eventual pattern is still obscure, and may remain so for some considerable time even after the Mau Mau rebellion is put down. This subject is considered in paragraphs 263-270 of my report. For the moment the commandstructure in East Africa must stay as it is.Recommendation303.   No change.
B. The Use of the Strategic Reserve304. It is of course true that the main object of my examination is to make recommendations that will ensure against demands being made for the despatchof troops from the United Kingdom. Though the Colonial Governments mustrealise that they stand in internal security matters as the wicket keeper (and very close to the wicket) the fact remains that, anyway until the various territoriesachieve self-government, Her Majesty&apos;s Government must inevitably be preparedto field at long-stop.305. The Chiefs of Staff have recently considered a report by the directors of Plans on &quot; The Tasks of the United Kingdom Strategic Reserve in Cold War.&quot;As regards the Royal Navy, there is no Strategic Reserve as such, but reinforce-ments for any particular task would be found from existing Fleets. Similarly,there is no Strategic Air Reserve as such, but Air Forces can be moved at short notice, if not committed to specific theatres. As regards the Army, it is plannedthat by April, 1956, two Infantry Divisions (less divisional regiments RAG.) andone independent parachute brigade should be available.306. The paper referred to above analyses the problem under two broadheadings firstly, operational tasks requiring the use of balanced forces, and secondly, internal security tasks. The first of these includes such contingenciesas support of Jordan against Israel in accordance with our Treaty obligations,protection of British interests in Egypt and the external defence of Malaya. though these may be included in Cold War commitments in the proper sense of the term,they do not come within the terms of my examination. The second category dealswith internal security tasks in the proper sense of the word, and for these tasks itshould be adequate to provide the army units concerned with some lesser scale of equipment than normal.307. The paper in question revolves to some considerable extent round theproblem of air transport, and this is obviously of primary importance, since thefirst requirement in those cases must be that the reinforcements should arrivepromptly so that their action can be remedial rather than punitive.308. I do not consider, however, that the paper adequately tackles the internal security requirement. There exists, to-day, one Battalion in the United Kingdomknown as the Immediate Strategic Reserve Battalion. The theory is that thisBattalion would be used in the event of the Overseas Command in question findingitself incapable of producing the required reinforcements from its own resources.In my opinion this does not go far enough, and I recommend that the followingsuggestion should now be examined in detail by the Ministries concerned.309. The requirement in my opinion is that one Brigade of three battalions of the United Kingdom Strategic Reserve be earmarked and trained for internal security duties in the Colonies. These Battalions should, anyway for the nextfew years, be on a special light scale of equipment, which must be determinedas a result of examination. They should be air-transportable, including the bulkof their transport. They should be specially trained in so far as this is practicable,in order to enable them to carry out the duties for which they might be required.This is not impossible. Some measure of training for jungle or bush warfare canbe given in such places as Savernake Forest, provided instructors with the necessarypractical experience are available. They must be taught something about theproblems in the various territories to which they might be sent, and, in particular,the administrative and police structure in those Colonies. They must be taughthow internal security operations are carried out on the ground and co-co-ordinated with the civil administration and the police. They must be taught how Britishtroops can assist, not only the administration in such situations, but the peopleof the territory concerned. I believe a great deal can be done in this way to preparethose Battalions, both professionally and mentally, for any task which they mighthave to carry out.310. If one or more Battalions is sent hurriedly to some territory in the hopes that their despatch may prove a remedial, as opposed to a punitive solution, theyshould be accompanied by certain other personnel, to be earmarked now, including a few Army Intelligence Officers and Special Branch experts from this country.Since in such a situation it is probable that considerable increases in establishmentare being carried out hurriedly by the local police force, one or two police officerswell versed in police organisation and training, could also usefully be included.
252-2. xx&quot;1311. I would like to have recommended that some six young Colonial Officecivil servants should also be flown out at the same time as an administrativeincrement; but I am told that this is impossible since they do not exist. i recommend that the matter be further investigated by the Colonial Office; officers on leave or on courses appear to offer a possible reservoir.312. This civilian increment would not, of course, on arrival in the territory,be allocated to the Army reinforcements. It would be disposed of as required bythe administration.313. I would also recommend that this little task force should include aflight of six light aircraft of the Pioneer type. As things stand to-day these arenot available in the United Kingdom. In fact the only Pioneer aircraft which exist are already in Malaya.314. The whole of this task force must be despatched by air transport,including the light aircraft. If such a force were in existence, then I would hope that,before its despatch, certain preparations would have been made at the receivingend, such as the construction of a few air landing strips in the sensitive areas and the necessary maintenance requirements for the Battalion or Battalions.Recommendation315. (i) That one brigade of three Battalions stationed in the United Kingdombe organised, equipped and trained for Colonial internal security duties.(ii) That a small administrative, police and intelligence increment be earmarked for despatch to any territory to which military reinforcements may be sent.(iii) That six light aircraft of the Pioneer type should also accompany anysuch reinforcement.316. I represented my views on this subject to the Chiefs of Staff on30th March, 1955.  Recommendations (i) and (iii) above are under study by them.
THE TROUBLE SPOTS&quot;Mind the Volcano! &quot;&quot; What Volcano? &quot; Alice Through the Looking-Glass.Introduction317. It seemed to me necessary, in dealing with so vast a subject as that setout in my terms of reference, to make not only general recommendations for improving the system as a whole, but also particular recommendations in regardto the most important areas. Even if some of the former are found unacceptable,I hope that the latter, which follow, will at least be adopted.318. The first step was to define the areas in question. This, I felt, was a task which could best be undertaken by the J.I.C., as the only repository of collectivewisdom of the necessary kind. They reported as follows (LLC. (55) 28 of23rd March):-&quot; The following appear to us to be the five territories in which trouble liableto involve the commitment of Imperial forces is likely to occur in the next fewyears: (a) British Guiana.(b) Cyprus.(c) Hong Kong.(d) Singapore.(e) Uganda.&quot;319. The assessments on which this judgment was based can be found as appendices to LLC. (55) 28; the question was considered under the generalheadings of (i) penetration by Communism; (ii) labour troubles; (iii) racial troubles;(iv) anti-British troubles.320. In addition, the J.I.C. said they &quot; thought it useful to set out certain other categories of territories, apart from Kenya and the Federation of Malaya,since the troubles in those territories are being dealt with and Imperial troops havealready been committed.   The remaining categories are as follows:  (a) Territories where there is an existing or potential commitment for imperial forces for external causes rather than internal securityAden intervention by the Yemen.British Honduras Guatemalan pretentions.Falkland Islands Argentinian pretentions.British Somaliland re-transfer of the Haud to Ethiopian sovereignty.(b) Territories where Internal trouble might arise but which seem unlikely to involve the commitment of Imperial ForcesGold Coast.Nigeria.Northern Rhodesia.Sierra Leone.(c) All other territories the exclusion of territories from any of the above categories is not intendedto mean that in our opinion trouble will arise in no circumstances, but to indicatethat they do not in our opinion fall into any of the categories set out above.&quot;321. I have confined my recommendations to the five principal &quot; trouble-spots.&quot; I realise, of course, how very arbitrary such a limitation must be; but itdoes enable a detailed approach to specific problems.47969
52 f322. Having agreed on the areas, the next stage was to establish the problems.For this purpose the Colonial Office telegraphed a long questionnaire to the governors concerned, the object of which was to elicit whether, in their view, theyhad all they wanted; if not, what they did want; and why, in that case, they had not got it. Their replies form the basis of the individual recommendations which follow. As will appear, I have not always felt able to accept the Governor^ viewof the requirements.323. Over and above these individual recommendations, the Colonial office should, I suggest, make it a rule that any applications from the trouble spots for anything in short supply, be it staff, equipment, or anything else, should be given priority over similar applications from other territories.324.   The &quot; trouble-spots &quot; are arranged in what, in my view, appears their order of urgency (the J.I.C. order is cautiously alphabetical).Recommendation325.   That priority be given to applications from the &quot; trouble-spots &quot; for staff,equipment, &amp;c.1. Cyprus326. [Note : The first five paragraphs which follow were drafted before thebomb incidents began, and before my visit to Cyprus. I have left them as they stand, as they point a moral which might be applicable to other territories. the succeeding paragraphs were, of course, written after visiting Cyprus.]327. While the designation of other territories as &quot; trouble-spots &quot; may beopen to question, nobody is likely to deny the claim of Cyprus to be one. It is an area with a burning problem, Enosis, to which no solution is apparently in sight,and the flames of which are diligently fed both by the national priesthood and bya foreign government. It possesses, moreover, the largest and best organisedCommunist Party in any Colonial territory outside the Far East; this can probablycount on the votes of up to one-third of the electorate, and is perfectly free. Therehave been serious riots in the past, and the situation to-day is uneasy.328. This is the place where we have decided to erect a base which is to bethe key to the Eastern Mediterranean, and on which the defence policy not only of the United Kingdom but of the West hinges. To construct this base we arespending some  30 million.329. It might be thought that, in these circumstances, the internal securityof the base would have the first call on the Governments money, man-power, andgeneral interest. But the Governor himself has told me that in his view the toppriorities in Cyprus to-day are the Information Service, agricultural reform, water,intelligence and police, in that order.330. I can appreciate, as well as anyone, the importance of matters such asagricultural reform in the long-term fight against Communism, and the particularneeds in respect of the fight against Enosis. But, with respect, I cannot understandhow law and order can fail in Cyprus to have top priority. There are, it seems tome, only two assumptions on which it could be relegated to a low one. The first would be if the situation were wholly satisfactory, and nothing remained to bedone. This, it has long been agreed, is not the case; details follow below. Thesecond would be if the difficulties of achieving a satisfactory situation were admitted to be insuperable, despite any system of priorities. This has not, to my knowledge,been suggested. Difficulties, of course, there are. To spend money on the policeis never popular, as expenditure on agriculture would be. To spend very large sums on police might mean so unbalancing the budget that Cyprus would have difficulty in raising development capital on the open markets. But this brings meback to the crucial point I have already touched on in the introduction; can it be wise to give priority to development schemes, if this means skimping on law andorder? Is there much value in agricultural reform, if the land is liable to be laidwaste in rioting? Must we always wait until the emergency has broken out before we spend any money-and then spend millions more than it would have cost toprevent it?331. I have stated the case for action on the Cyprus police with some force,because the history of the subject suggests that it is time to do so. In 1952 the inspector-General (Mr. Muller) made, in his report to the Governor, a series of
5jrecommendations, far too many of which are still outstanding. For example, in1952 Mr. Muller reported that the Special Branch was behind the times, and shouldbe reorganised under a whole-time gazetted officer; that certain subordinate ranksshould have their pensionable status restored; that policy should aim at providinghousing for a high proportion of married men; that high priority be given to police building requirements, since existing accommodation was most inadequate;that there should be a tactical reserve and striking force; that the Police shouldhave enough Law Books; and (I quote verbatim) &quot; I cannot too strongly urge thenecessity for introducing V.H.F. Radio Communication for the general use of thePolice if the force is to be efficient by modern standards.&quot; In August 1954Mr. MacDonald (Security Intelligence Adviser to the Colonial Office) reported thatthe S.B. was &quot; in an embryonic stage.....   It is at present inadequate in strength, completely lacking in training and short of funds.&quot;332. When I enquired into the position in Cyprus, just before the bombingstarted, the position was as follows: The post of Assistant Commissioner special branch was still unfilled; housing and police buildings were as far off as ever(though pensionable status had just, at last, been achieved); no tactical reserve was available; there were still not enough Law Books; and though the Governor had recently asked for the wireless system he was urged to install in 1952, there seemedto be no particular hurry about getting it set up.333. In the second week in April the situation was radically and gratifyinglychanged. Financial approval was given for the Police Commissioner^ desiderataalmost as fast as he could put them in; the limiting factor ceased to be money, and became man-power to fill the new posts. Where problems could be resolved bya stroke of the pen, as in the case of financial provision for communicationsequipment, this was done; where this was impossible, as in the case of providingpolice accommodation or raising pay, the necessary decision in principle was taken,and my suggestion that a token start be made was accepted. The beneficial effecton the morale of the police, at seeing these long despaired of grievances at lastabout to be allayed, must be immense. There will be a corresponding impact onthe internal security of the colony.334. The result of all this activity is that I have, I am glad to say,comparatively little left to recommend. The most important recommendations!made from Cyprus (see Appendix VII) the appointment of a Director of intelligence and an increase in the police establishment have been approved andare under way. At the time of writing, the following other recommendations made from Cyprus are however outstanding:335. (1) An announcement now that an increase of 5 per cent, has been granted in police pay as an earnest of Government^ intention to tackle the job in the 1956estimates.(2) A start to be made on a token 50 married quarters.(3) Explosives to be imported through only one agency, and held and issuedby the police as required.(4) Construction of a five-storey building for police and Special Branch.336. In addition to the above, the following desiderata remain on the special branch side:(i) As the Cyprus Government have now decided to produce establishmentfor a post of Assistant Commissioner Special Branch, this should be filled as soon as possible.(ii) The present Superintendent Special Branch should, in that event, beretained as second-in-command.(iii) It will be some considerable time before Special Branch records are in astate which will enable the Special Branch to function really efficiently.In the meantime, on the short term view, it would be of great assistance if a suitable individual from the Security Service could be found to actas Desk Officer in connection with the short term operations arisingfrom the Interrogation Centre, which I hope will shortly be functioningefficiently.(iv) Two European permanent pensionable registrars are required to deal withrecords. The situation today is that approval has been given for twolocally recruited European female registrars at a fixed salary of  400 ner
3522. yxvannum non-pensionable, in addition to the temporary registrar who isin charge of re-organising records and training staff. This is not good enough.337. As regards Information work, I have not seen the report made by thecompetent Colonial Office official, who visited Cyprus just before me. I have nodoubt his recommendations will receive due attention. But there is an aspect ofthe matter which I suspect has not been adequately studied, and that is the political warfare, as opposed to the straight information, side. In a country where relationshave deteriorated to the extent they have in Cyprus, this aspect becomes at least as important as the other. I suggest that an expert from the Information research department of the Foreign Office, which deals with such matters, be sent to cyprus to study the possibilities. I appreciate of course that no real work can be done in political warfare until a definite policy towards Cyprus has been laid down.Recommendation338. That the Governor be urged to implement the outstandingrecommendations set out above.2. Hong Kong339. The situation revealed here is most unsatisfactory, in view of theexposed and explosive nature of the Colony. Special Branch, in particular, isdangerously weak. It is impossible to foresee when the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment may settle on some pretext, such as the aircraft incident, to createtrouble, yet there is an admitted lack of knowledge of Chinese communistorganisation in the Colony.340. The mose serious deficiencies, as shown in the Governor^ reply to the questionnaire, are as follows:  (i) Police341. (a) The Establishment is deficient, as follows:  Deficiency      EstablishmentOfficers...............       9    out of        62InspectorateN.C.O.&apos;sFemale N.C.O.&apos;sConstables50 ,, ,, 49266 ,, ,, 91210 ,, ,, ^ 2625 ,, ,, 3,893The shortage of officers and inspectors is serious. The deficiencies &quot; will bemade up as soon as possible after 1.4.55.&quot; It is not stated how, nor why theywere not made up before.(b) Accommodation is only enough for about 25 per cent, of marriedN.C.O.&apos;s and Constables, and 60 per cent, of married Inspectors. The bottleneckis availability of architectural and supervisory staff, plus the refugee housingcommitment.  A committee &quot; has the matter under close consideration.&quot;(c) Motor transport is 3 items short of establishment. The establishmentitself is said to be inadequate, as &quot; it was not found possible to approve &quot; theamount asked for (not stated).(ii) Special Branch342. (a) The Establishment is deficient, as follows:  Deficiency  EstablishmentOfficers     ...............         3 out of 8Inspectors...............        15 ,,   ,, 42N.C.O.&apos;s...............        16 ,,   ,, 31Woman Conf. Ass.        .........         4 ,,   ,, 27Interpreters         ............         1 ,,   ,, 15This shortage must be serious. The position is said to be the same as for police.(b) Pensionable status does not apply to 22 female confidential assistants.
3522. xx\/(iii) General343. The policy is said to be &quot; to improve the efficiency of the present strengthrather than to increase the numbers. Every effort is being made within the limitsimposed by overall financial considerations to provide better accommodation and welfare facilities.&quot;344.   My comments on all the above are as follows:  (a) If the above quotation means that the present strength (as opposed toestablishment) is unlikely to be increased, this is not good enough,particularly as regards Special Branch.(b) The &quot; overall financial considerations &quot; may not give a high enoughpriority to police housing. There are still seventy families inGovernment quarters in the Old Bailey living in as bad conditions asanywhere in the Colonial territories. In times of trouble a high proportion of married men in the force must be distracted by thoughts of the safety and well-being of their families. The statement that thematter is under consideration by a Committee is not enough. Thismatter should be energetically pursued from London.(c) The inadequacies in motor transport must be made good.(d) It is not clear whether the establishment of officers includes the 3 additionalAssistant Superintendents recommended by the S.I.A. in his reportof December, 1954, or whether the post of Assistant CommissionerSpecial Branch, has been restored, or whether a Senior Superintendenthas been provided as Deputy. These posts, providing as they do the leadership and direction of the Branch, are of cardinal importance.(e) There are only 4 women confidential assistants, as against the minimum of 9 recommended by the S.I.A.(f) It is not clear whether the redeployment will involve the creation of thethree strong sections to deal with communism envisaged in the SecurityIntelligence Adviser&apos;s recommendations. The creation of a properprotective security section is also most essential and is underlined bythe case of the Indian Airways aircraft incident.(g) It appears that the very necessary reorganisation and strengthening of hong Kong Special Branch is proceeding extremely slowly.(h) There are a variety of recommendations in the S.I.A.&apos;s report ofDecember, 1954, action on which may or may not have been taken.345. The S.I.A. flew to Hong Kong in response to an urgent request inNovember, 1954, and there is still no indication whether his recommendations areto be implemented.  There should be careful follow-up action on his report.(iv) Information346. The Government Information Services, while energetically and efficiently directed, need strengthening in several important respects (there is some prospect of this being done). Additional staff at Victoria and a new Centre atKowloon for the British Council were Drogheda recommendations which remainunimplemented (estimated cost approximately  8,000).347.   I recommend that these be now implemented.Recommendation348.   That the Governor be urged to remedy the deficiencies shown above.3. British Guiana349. This trouble spot is dealt with, to some extent, in Chapter IIIA. (5)Category II (paragraphs 238 to 240), which deals with the problem of Caribbeansecurity in general, and that of withdrawing British troops from British Guianain particular. The root of the trouble, and consequently the way to deal with it, isa political matter outside my competence. But there are various steps which can and should be taken now, on the police and intelligence side, if any realimprovement in internal security is ever to be achieved. The recommendations which follow have been concerted with the I.G. of Colonial Police and the S.I.A.They are without prejudice to any recommendations which the latter may makewhen he has completed his forthcoming Caribbean tour.
I. Police(a) Establishment350. A further 75 other ranks are required. The present short fall is nodoubt due to the normal time lag in recruiting additional establishment already authorised for the current year (i.e., 75). Additional requirement if military forces are reduced is four selected ex-patriate gazetted officers and 150 rank and file.(b) Pay and AllowancesProvided Governments proposals for salaries revision are approved, rates of pay for lower ranks appear to be adequate. Rates of pay for gazetted officers will still be unsatisfactory. These should be put on a close parity with the neighbouring territory of Trinidad; otherwise there will be the inevitable driftof officers away from British Guiana with a low quality intake in replacement.The starting pay for Assistant Superintendents is most unsatisfactory, being  200less than that offered in Trinidad, though the upper segment of the scale is the same.(c) QuartersBarrack room accommodation for all single men must be provided. Thereis ample space for the building of temporary or semi-temporary wooden hutmentbarracks.Office accommodation particularly for Special Branch in out-stationsshould also be provided as a matter of great urgency, if necessary in temporarymaterials. British Guiana has a tropical climate and wooden construction isquite satisfactory.Married quarters should be provided at all stations for at least 60 per cent, of the married strength of constables, sergeants, and Inspectors. This is accepted as an&quot; optimum &quot; but is regarded as &quot; impossible &quot; for financial reasons. This is a very short-sighted policy as the question of adequate housing is paramount in regardto the morale and reliability of the police force.(d) EquipmentThere appears to be no static H.F. network, giving radio communication between all Stations and Headquarters. Mobile Units operating on V.H.F. tostations is being developed but this does not meet the need for maintaininglong-distance communications between all stations and Georgetown.(e) AircraftIt would appear that at least one Grumman Amphibian aircraft is necessaryin this country.II. Intelligence(a) Strength of Special Branch351. Of a total of 45 officers and men employed on Special Branch work,16 are engaged in Immigration and Passport Control duties. There are thereforeless than 30 officers and men engaged solely on intelligence work. This seemsto be quite inadequate to deal with the situation at present existing in british guiana. The request for an extra four constables is most modest.(b) Office EquipmentA Special Branch cannot function without an efficient records system. Steelcabinets are essential for holding files under secure conditions. The Branch mustcertainly have its own Roneo machine for preparing secret reports andappreciations. Typewriters are, of course, essential; card-index cabinets and aDuostat machine are necessary.(c) Technical Equipment(i) It is a matter of surprise that the Minifon recorder has given such good results as it has failed elsewhere. The S.I.A. would like to defer any decision until he has seen results.(ii) Two miniature cameras of the &quot; Robot&quot; type are probably essential.Comment on the other technical equipment required must  await an examination of the problem on the spot.
3S2.Z YXV4. Uganda355. The picture here is most encouraging. I was much impressed with thepains which had obviously been taken to create a model police force and an efficient Special Branch. With one exception, dealt with below, all is either inorder or well in hand. While much of the credit must go to the Governor andhis efficient Commissioner, the gratifying readiness to spend money on the policeis due partly to a fat balance and partly to the fears of the rich Indian merchants,accentuated by the trouble over the Kabaka.356. The only limiting factors in regard to the police programme are,according to the Acting Governor, (a) the inability of the police training school todeal with the intake of recruits a matter on which my recommendations earlier in this Report should help; and (b) limited building capacity, which has made itimpossible to &quot; devote a greater proportion of the available effort to the construc-tion of police accommodation without a politically unacceptable sacrifice of other important public works.&quot;357. This is of course the familiar dilemma. While in general it seems thatUganda is tackling it on the right lines indeed the treatment of the police has beengenerous to a degree there is one assessment of priorities with which I could not agree. The building of the new Police Headquarters, which would provide the accommodation badly needed by an expanded Special Branch, was only to takeplace &quot; within the next two or three years.&quot; This is not good enough. The matter has been outstanding for five years already. When I discussed this matter withthe Acting Governor, I was assured that a settlement would be reached very shortly.There was no longer any difficulty about money, but only about the site; and this could be resolved. If by any chance these hopes are disappointed, the matter should be pursued.358. On the Information side, I was told by the Information Officer,Mr. White (who impressed me very favourably), that while in the long term theestablishment of the East African-United Kingdom Information Office recom-mended by the Drogheda Committee was desirable, his most immediate requirementwas programme staff for broadcasting. I hope it will be found possible to help him over this. Wireless listening is growing at a fantastic pace in Uganda, andthere are important possibilities open to us which should on no account be missed.Recommendation359. That if the question of police accommodation is not settled, it shouldbe pursued, and that the required programme staff be provided.(d) Registry and Clerical StaffPermanent and pensionable posts for key registry staff are essential.(e) Office AccommodationAdequate office accommodation, including a small strong-room, is clearlynecessary. If records are insecure, this is a most serious matter since it may affectother intelligence organisations in liaison with Special Branch.Special Branch staff in out-stations must have their own office. They cannotfunction in Police Station charge-rooms.III. Information Services352. The United Kingdom Information Officer in Trinidad cannot adequatelycover British Guiana, and a separate sub-office in Georgetown seems desirable.This might cost about  500-600 per annum.353. Boosting of the B.B.C. signal has long been recognised as necessary if satisfactory reception is to be obtained; the capital expense of a booster station is of the order of  35,000.Recommendation354. That the Governor be urged to implement the detailed recommendationsabove.
t(2) Special Branch(a) Strength and Establishment361. Special Branch is up to establishment, which appears adequate. Theredoes not appear to be a regular second-in-command of the Branch, and I wouldhave thought that with only two Superintendents the command burden on the SeniorAssistant Commissioner must be very heavy, especially as in a Colony like Singaporehe must necessarily have to make numerous policy decisions.(b) AccommodationPlans for expansion are in hand.(c) organisation the screening sections do not appear to cover protective security (includingthe protection of material and information). It may well be that the Branch requiresreorganisation and redeployment to make the best use of the staff available. Itis understood that the Adviser lent by Security Intelligence, Far East, is making certain recommendations on the internal organisation and functions of the Branchwhich is one of the oldest established and most experienced Special Branches inthe Colonial territories. It is clear that the Branch has adequate resources but onlycloser inspection would reveal whether these are being used to the maximumadvantage.(3) Information362.   There seem to be no important shortcomings.Recommendation363.   That the organisation of Special Branch receive further attention.(1) Police360. Here the Governor appears to have got pretty well everything he wants,and I have no recommendations to make. I can only hope that the force will come up to expectations.
CHAPTER VFINANCE&quot; The little fishes&apos; answer was&apos; We cannot do it, Sir, because Alice Through the Looking-Glass.General364. My approach to the financial aspect of my recommendations is stated inparagraphs 10-13 of the Introduction. I have of course read the Treasury paper(GEN. 485/13), but I have not consulted the Treasury in any way, since I did not feel that this would have been in accordance with the terms of my directive. Iwas instructed to submit recommendations; the question of financing them is outside my competence.365. On the general issue, I agree profoundly with the &quot; insurance premium &quot;view stated in paragraph 20 of the Report on Defence Policy (C. 54/329), andquoted at the beginning of Chapter I; the recommendations in this Report were,I see, endorsed by the Prime Minister. It follows that I differ, equally profoundly,with the Colonial Office view which, in effect, is that colonies should only have thepolice or intelligence forces which their Governors think they can afford. Thequestion the Governor should ask himself, in my opinion, is not &quot; Can we afford an efficient police and intelligence force? &quot; but &quot; Can we afford not to have an efficient police and intelligence force? &quot;366. I understand that the Treasury consider the insurance premium analogyfalse, as the premium is compared only to the possible loss, and not to the probablerisk. But he would be a bold man, inside or outside the Treasury, who wouldassess the risk as low; and taking stake and risk together I cannot see how mymodest premium can fail to be acceptable.(1) Intelligence and Police367. The general recommendations involving expense can be divided into two categories those where the expense might have to fall in whole or in part onthe United Kingdom and those where it should fall solely on the colonial government. To attempt to cost the latter would be a task outside my com-competence; for example, I could not attempt to state in figures the extra expenditureon pay which would be necessary in each territory. The former, however, is capable of expression in very round figures as follows:  Capital Recurrent(a) Intelligence                                                         3 new Special Branch Training Units (seeAppendix II)    ............       28,000 5,6003 Deputy S.I.A&apos;s (extra allowances)       ... 15,00028,000 20,600(b) Police4 new Regional Training Colleges  (seeAppendix I)     ............      219,000 34,0002 extra Deputy I.G&apos;s (extra allowances) ... 10,0001 Assistant Director Colonial Studies     ... 1,50045,500Total............      247,000 66,100352.x xxx

I had hoped to be able to give figures for the cost of implementing mydetailed recommendations under this heading, but at the time of going to press thenecessary information is not available. It can no doubt be produced by the time this report is studied.(2) Armed Forces368.  The financial implications can be summarised as follows:  Savings  m.

357zxxxGENERAL&quot; Who overcomes by forceHath overcome but half his enemy.&quot; Milton.Introduction370. As I explained in paragraph 5 of this report, I consider that the subjectsdealt with in the pages which follow, though strictly outside my terms of reference,are really of the first importance.371. I am well aware that the Committee will, by now, have had enough; butif they would hear me out to the end I should be more than grateful.1. &quot; Operation Service &quot;&quot; The Indian policeman is the ubiquitous embodiment of the government. There aremillions of people in India who have never seen a squad of soldiers, who nevergo even to the headquarters of a district, to whom the British Officer is hardly morethan a name. There is no village, however remote or difficult of access it may be,that is not regularly visited by the police.The range of duties of the Indian Police is far wider than that of the English Police.They are concerned in practically every detail of Indian village life. The state of crops, the irrigation of fields, the condition of roads and paths, private feuds,jealousies and quarrels, feasts, fairs, rejoicings, and all the thousand and one important, trifling, pathetic or humorous details which make up the existence ofan Indian rural community are often of professional interest to the police, whothus touch the life of the people at almost every point. And inside each province the organization of the police is arranged so as to ensure that their control shall beas complete and constant as is possible with the number of men at disposal.&quot;-Curry &quot;The Indian Police&quot; (page 43).372. I feel some diffidence in commending, in this report, an innovationintroduced during my term of office in Malaya. The fact that I do so can be taken as proof of how strongly I feel about it.373. &quot; Operation Service &quot; was started initially as an attempt to bring themembers of the Police Force into a more friendly and confident relationship withthe general public. The idea was to get the public to think of the policeman, not as a bogeyman, but as a friend, and of the police station as a place, not where onegot into trouble, but where one got out of it. The police were disarmed (exceptfor operational duty) and given badges showing clasped hands with the motto&quot; Ready to Serve &quot;; the public were invited to bring their problems and enquiriesto the police station. The campaign was launched with the necessary publicity in press and radio, and was a considerable success.374. The next step was to introduce it to all other branches of theadministration. All public servants were reminded that the need and theopportunity for an operation of this kind existed in all government departments,and that they could achieve the same success as the police if they tried to put this idea of service across as far as their own personal work in their department went.They were urged to remember that as government servants, they were servants ofthe public, not its masters. The need for a kindly and sympathetic approach to apossibly bewildered or suspicious public was explained.375. I am absolutely certain that there is no better way of ensuring thefundamental security of a people than by trying to get the basic humanrelationships on the right lines. In newly developing societies the type of nativewith a little education, who acquires an administrative position, can be far more of a menace to his fellow creatures than the &quot; imperialist&quot; civil servant orpoliceman. Equally, he can be of the greatest value as an interpreter of the newsocial order to his more backward brother.376. The part which those outside the administration can play in humanrelationships is dealt with in the next section. It is of course harder to lay down.But where definite direction can be given, as is the case with an administration, Iwould urge most strongly that the experiment at least be tried.
3bZz ^xy 11 \Recommendation377. That Governors be invited to institute, in their territories, a campaignon the lines of &quot; Operation Service.&quot; It requires careful and detailed planning.2. The Duty of the British Overseas378. The need for friendship and understanding between the British overseas and the peoples of the Colonies and dependent territories during these comingyears is self evident. Quite apart from the cold war, these people are now politicallyexposed to the eddies and swirls of nationalism and to those dangers of xenophobiawhich follow on the tensions produced by rapid social, political or economicchanges. It may be that under the pressure of day to day governmentadministration or commercial competition, the British in our Colonies are apt topay rather more attention to the &quot; technical &quot; aspects of life than to the vitalproblems of human relationships. One of the factors which will influence all thesepeoples must surely be the conclusions they draw about the West from its representatives whether in government service, the armed forces or commerciallife. We British ought to be very conscious of this responsibility and of the potential which we possess for influencing the minds of men and women. It is not sufficient just to wish these peoples well. The hand of friendship must be offered in a definite and practical manner if we are to make a real contribution to theprocess of their development into modern societies.379. Somewhere this has been described as the application of &quot; social skills,&quot;as opposed to the mere offering of technical and administrative assistance and advice. The latter is comparatively straightforward, housing, hospitals, schools,clinics, wages, development schemes and so on. These matters are presumablybeing tackled in all territories as quickly as the financial and other conditionspermit.380. I do not feel so happy about the field of human relationships theother half of the &quot; social skills &quot; which are so necessary. There is no doubt thatin the past we British have been bad mixers. We have done too little too slowlyto eliminate race-consciousness among the various communities. Racial intoleranceis still a factor to be reckoned with.381. There is hardly an activity in any of these territories where the local inhabitants, in their attempts to &quot; get something going &quot; (probably under the urgentguidance of a devoted Government officer or of his wife), do not want a kindlyand a guiding hand, and who will not continue to want that help for a good manyyears to come. I feel sure that in all territories this help is given to an immensedegree by the officers (and in many cases by their wives) of the administration,or of the technical departments, very many of whom work themselves to the bonein the process. But there are not enough of them on the ground and there neverwill be, for a variety of reasons. We should throw our net wider, and it shouldbe the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that we should do so. There are two possible fields commerce and the fighting services.382. As regards commerce (and industry where it exists) any good firmworking in the Colonial territories makes sure that the social conditions of itslabour force are satisfactory. It is easy to say that it does so in its own self-interest and the self-interest of its shareholders. That may well be but thegreat firms (and my contention is reinforced by the record of the great oil companies in the Middle East to-day) realise that these social improvements arenecessary not only in the &quot; compound &quot; of the factory or installation but overa wider field.383. Some steps have already been taken along the right lines. In October,1953, as the result of a Colonial Office initiative, a new organisation called&quot; Oversea Service &quot; was set up under the auspices of the British Council of Churchesand the Conference of British Missionary Societies. It provides courses, lastingsix days and costing 10 guineas, aimed at instilling into those about to take upjobs abroad a proper approach to their new environment. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment make to &quot; Oversea Service &quot; a Colonial Development and Welfare Grant ofthe not very munificent sum of  2,000 per annum, and Colonial Governments have,so far, contributed another  250. This is not enough. More should be done todevelop this instrument, which clearly has tremendous potentialities for good.Here is a chance for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to give a clear and compellinglead.   It is for the Colonial Office to work out ways and means of doing so in
respect of colonial territories. One way which, readily suggests itself is that all members of the Colonial Overseas Services should be invited, in more positiveterms, to attend &quot; Oversea Service &quot; courses at some stage in their career; anotherpossibility would be to include an &quot; Oversea Service &quot; course in the Colonial ServiceCourse &quot; A.&quot;384. As regards the fighting services (of which in this context the army is obviously far the biggest partner), I must firmly believe that we can still do agreat deal to restore &quot; the years that the locust hath eaten.&quot; The many generationsduring which we governed a large part of the vast sub-continent of India are inthis respect a sorry story. The army looked after its servants and I hope their wives and families. But that, by and large, was as far as they ever got in entering into the life of the community as a whole.385. Perhaps the army did not have the imagination to see the possibilities;perhaps the Indian Civil Service (or whichever it might be in other countries) wouldnot have welcomed &quot; outside interference.&quot; But of one thing I am quite sure and that is that the potential dividend of goodwill to be drawn was immense; and still is large, in the difficult days to come.386. It may be said that my views on this vital question are unduly influenced by my personal experiences in the Federation of Malaya. But I do not think so.If it comes to that, I believe that we have only started to scratch at the surfaceof the problem in that small country. And I realise that much is being done inthe same respect in many other Colonies and dependent territories.387. The potential field is immense. To take a few examples, Youth Clubs,Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, approved schools, Social Welfare Department orphanages,&amp;c, medical clinics, Women&apos;s Institutes or the equivalent. Red Cross, St. Johnand in particular the vast amount of social work necessary in such new communitiesas the New Villages in Malaya and the equivalent in Kenya.388. My comments do not apply only to the way of life adopted by theexisting personnel of our firms overseas. They apply also to the methods of selection of our commercial representatives in the Colonies and their elementaryinstruction at the beginning of their careers.389. My comments apply in particular to the wives of our British repre-sentatives overseas, who in many cases do untold harm. I believe this is partly because they have never had their duty explained to them whether it be in theservices or in commerce or (to a lesser extent and here I am thinking of theWomen&apos;s Corona Society) in the Colonial Civil Service and its technicaldepartments.390.   My Recommendations are as follows:  (i) The problem should be studied by a committee representative of allinterests the Colonial Civil Service, the Churches, the army, commerce and industry. The representatives chosen should be selected from thosewho have real experience of these problems on the ground, and whoare receptive to the ideals in question.(ii) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should approach the business interests concerned such as the F.B.I., &amp;c.(iii) The Colonial Secretary should impress on Governors the urgency of this approach.(iv) The Service Ministries should at once ensure that all sailors, soldiers and airmen in the Colonial territories appreciate what is expected of them,and offer their considerable resources in man-power to the localgovernment authorities.3. Education391. It is admitted that, both in the Malayan emergency and in Kenya,penetration of the schools played an important part. In the Far East, Communistpenetration of Chinese Schools is still a very live issue, to which the Hong KongEducation Department sensibly devotes a special section. In Africa subversion insome form or other may now be being preached in the schools, just as hymns toKenyatta were sung in the early days of Mau Mau. There can be few, if any, more dangerous centres of Communist infection.392. The only way to deal with this problem is by having as large and efficient an inspectorate as possible; there can obviously be no hope of exercising
100 per cent, control, but it should not be necessary to fall as far off to the otherextreme as, for example, in Kenya, where in 1939 there were only 14 EuropeanEducation Officers. More recently, the Directors of Education of northern rhodesia, Hong Kong and Singapore have complained of being understaffed.393. The need for an increased inspectorate is clear. How to meet it is muchharder to say. The difficulties are great, and familiar to those responsible. Briefly,recruits are unlikely to be forthcoming from this country, where teachers are shortalready, or from the territories, where the terms of service are not sufficiently attractive to bring in the right men. Presumably better pay is the ultimate answer,though by no means an easy one to put into practice.Recommendation394. That, in view of the great importance of the school inspectorate in preventing the dissemination of Communism, Governors be urged where necessaryto try to get pay and conditions made attractive enouah to recruit the necessary staff.4. Short Tours395. In paragraph 157 I have recommended the institution of short tours and short leaves for the police.396. I am convinced that this is equally necessary as regards administrative officers. Lack of expert knowledge of a district, based on continuing experience in it, is a prime contributor to local troubles. The &quot; general post&quot; which results from the long leave system is too serious a defect to be tolerated any longer. Thefact that short tours may not now be popular is of minor importance; the causes of this must be eliminated as far as possible.Recommendation397.   That short tours be adopted throughout the Colonial Service.5. Trades Unions398. The Trades Unions in all the territories offer an obvious target forattempted Communist penetration. Many, if not the majority, of Colonial TradesUnion officials are extremely inexperienced, and it has occurred to me that perhapsmore assistance could be given to them by this country.399. Both the T.U.C. and the I.C.F.T.U., to which the former is affiliated,send experienced organisers to the Colonial territories.400. The T.U.C. have sent 19 such individuals abroad since 1947 for varyingperiods, only two of whom were concerned in the running of Trades Union training courses of the type which I have in mind. Of the 6 individual visits carried out bymembers of I.C.F.T.U. since 1952, none were concerned with the training of trades Union leaders.Recommendation401. That more emphasis be placed on the organisation of Trade Unionscourses, preferably using T.U.C. personnel, in those territories where potential danger might arise.6. Language Training402. The former high standard of language proficiency has admittedly been allowed to decline in all branches of the service, with a consequential decline inthe intimate relationship necessary between Government officers and thepopulation they administer. This can partly be accounted for by the exigencies of emergency conditions; in Kenya or Malaya officers obviously have little timeto spare.403. But knowledge of the language remains so vital an element in anycolonial officers make-up that a real drive should be made to get back to the oldstandards wherever possible.Recommendation404. That existing regulations regarding language proficiency be strictlyenforced wherever practicable, and that the importance of this subject be drawn tothe attention of all Governors.
APPENDIX ICOLONIAL POLICE TRAINING:  REGIONAL COLLEGESA. General405. There are four levels of Police Training required in the Colonial police service.(a) Force TrainingRecruit training.Refresher training.Specialist training for Constables and Corporals.Promotion Courses for the rank of Sergeant.(b) Regional College TrainingPromotion Courses for Sergeants for the rank of Inspector.Specialist Courses for non-gazetted ranks.Refresher Courses for Inspectors.Cadet Gazetted Officer Courses (non-expatriate).Security Training.(c) United Kingdom TrainingInspectors Courses for promotion.Initial Gazetted Officers Courses.Higher Specialist training.(d) Police College, RytonA.S.P. Courses.   Ryton &quot; A &quot; Course.Senior Officers Courses.  Ryton &quot; B &quot; Course.Command Course. Ryton &quot; C &quot; Course (see Appendix III).Note: Specialist Training to include C.I.D. and Forensic Science,Photography, Traffic, Communications, Prosecutions, Field Training and security Training.406.   The Regional Colleges could be grouped:  (a) Far Eastern, serving Malaya. North Borneo, Sarawak, Fiji, Singapore, Hong Kong (officers from the first four already attend courses at the Police TrainingCollege in the Federation of Malaya).(b) East African, serving Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, British Somaliland, Zanzibar.(c) Central African, serving Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland (Southern Rhodesia and theProtectorates should of course be included if ever this becomespracticable).(d) West African, serving Gold Coast, Gambia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.(e) West Indies, serving All the West Indian forces.Note: Some forces do not fall into a Regional Organisation at all, andmust be dealt with as special cases. They are mostly small forces, e.g., theSolomons should get higher training in Australia; Cyprus and Gibraltar inthe United Kingdom.407. The local needs of each Region differ widely, but in the main highertraining can be fairly well co-ordinated into a common syllabus for about 75 percent, of the time (by the I.G.).
B. Estimated Numbers and Expense414. Tables are given below (i) showing the approximate establishment ofAssistant Superintendents and Inspectors in the four areas, the number whichmight be trained in each area per annum, and the probable permanent InstructorStaff required; (ii) a very rough estimate of the cost.415. As regards (i), it is not possible to give a firm figure for the number of either Gazetted officers or Inspectors who could be spared annually from their territories to attend courses at these colleges. I think that it is agreed that it is most desirable for both officers and Inspectors to continue to come to the UnitedKingdom for Courses at Ryton and Hendon, as well as for specialist courses,e.g., C.I.D. Finger Prints, &amp;c. In addition, there will always be a certainpercentage of officers and Inspectors on leave, and probably (even under idealcircumstances) some vacancies in the establishments. Thus the numbers whichcould be spared for Regional Colleges might well not be high.416. As regards (ii), it is difficult indeed to find figures which would giveanything like a close estimate of costs, as there are so many items to be taken intoconsideration including costs of sites and site preparations, housing for permanent staff, domestic and clerical staff, outside grounds staff, lighting, water, furniture,telephone equipment and a dozen other items, all of which are likely to differ fromterritory to territory according to local labour costs and c.i.f. costs.417. However, I have tried to give some figures which could serve as a guideto minimum costs; in reality they might require up to 50 per cent, upward revisionE. and O.E. depending on the site selected for the particular area college.408. The Regional College should be under a Board of Governors to consistof the Chief Officer of Police of each Colony or Protectorate, with an OverseaCivil Service Officer nominated by the Governor of each country. The Chairman-ship of the Board should rotate between Colonies, term of tenure not less than2 years.409. The size or student capacity of each Regional College to be calculated onthe average yearly requirement for promotion to the ranks concerned. DirectingStaff would be required at about the rate of one D.S. to 10 students. They shouldbe United Kingdom trained. Allocations for vacancies to the College to be madeby the Commandant using the Force Establishment of the rank concerned as a guide.410. The Regional College should be financed by the countries concerned,contributions to be based on Establishments. A contribution from the UnitedKingdom Government will be most desirable. An Overseas Civil Servant will berequired as Secretary and Accountant of each College to work under the commandant.411. A sharp differentiation should be made between the training forGazetted and non-Gazetted ranks. With the exception of specialist training,training for Gazetted ranks should be undertaken in the United Kingdom. Thereis one exception that non-expatriate Cadet Gazetted Officers should receive initial training in Regional Colleges. This should be comparable in scope although longer to the initial Gazetted officer training now given at Mill Meece (United Kingdom).This training is essential to induce well-educated young men of standing to joinPolice Forces.412. Refresher training at all levels will be required after a few years, and regional Colleges should undertake this, as well as Forces.413. The length of courses can only be decided after a study of localconditions in each region. The governing factors being the yearly output requiredfor each type of course and finance. Initially, in the West African and the west indies a higher output of students than the coverage of yearly promotion needsmay be required, owing to the pressure of rapid political development, particularly for non-expatriate Gazetted ranks.

The capital cost of the college is worked on approximately  1,200 perman.421. The cost of instructors&apos; quarters is based on  4,000 per quarter, but doesnot cover quarters for other staff, menial and clerical, the numbers required notbeing known.422.   Recurrent expenditure only covers pay of staff and other charges.423. The building costs in each of the territories in East and West Africavary considerably so that the figures will again vary accordingly depending onwhere the colleges are to be built.APPENDIX IISPECIAL BRANCH(A) Regional Training Units424.   These might be set up as below:  Capital cost Cost ofof quarters for              RecurrentS.B. Unit staff    ;,                           West Africa    ......         6,000 -                      1,400West Indies     ......         6,000 -                      1,400East and Central Africa(based on Kenya)  ...        12,000 4,000                   2,800* Recurrent expenditure only covers pay of staff and other charges.425. The flow of S.B. trainees in West Africa and West Indies is unlikely tokeep the S.B. unit functioning for more than six months each year. An instructorof A.S.P&apos;s mark would be adequate for these areas and should be a supernumeraryS.B. officer which would ensure that he would be fully employed all the year round.426. By combining S.B. training for East and Central Africa and basing thetraining wing on Kenya, where the largest and most advanced S.B. exists, a flow of trainees could be maintained all the year round. Here a Chief Instructorrecruited from United Kingdom with wide intelligence experience would benecessary, together with an Assistant Instructor of A.S.P&apos;s rank.
(C) Syllabi434. These have been prepared in outline for all types of courses, and are heldby the Security Intelligence Adviser in the Colonial Office.(B) Security Service Courses427. Proposals for the future structure of courses for Colonial police officers, to be run by the Security Service in London, and by Regional special branch Training Schools, are set out below.428. Vacancies for the course for senior officers in London should be filled by officers who have been specially selected to attend, and who are sent to theUnited Kingdom for this purpose. Experience of running courses for officers whohappen to be on leave does not lead to the conclusion that this is an acceptableway of selecting officers to attend.429. Mr. C. Fenner of the Malayan Special Branch has collaborated in thepreparation of this paper. He has expressed doubts as to whether the proposedsenior course in London is precisely what is required for highly trained MalayanSpecial Branch officers, who have had the benefit of a local school for some yearswhere much of the instruction is still based on material originally provided by theSecurity Service. The Security Service do not agree with Mr. Fenner and consider that the course as proposed would provide useful instruction for seniorSpecial Branch officers from the Colonies as a whole.430. The Security Service are prepared to organise the proposed courses inLondon at the earliest date on which the Colonial Office is able to nominate suitableofficers to attend. For the senior course they suggest that there should be aminimum of six and a maximum of twelve officers.431. In addition to these proposals, the Security Service will be willing togive such assistance as it may be able to offer by running further courses inLondon, by helping to give local training to Special Branches in colonial territories, and by giving assistance with the setting up of Regional Schools.(i) Courses to be Run by the Security Service in London432. (a) A Course for Senior Police Officers, or others less senior who havealready received the training offered by a Regional School. Duration would be2-3 weeks. The object of this course would be to give senior officers anopportunity for advanced study and the exchange of views on the subjects listed.(b) A Course for Potential Instructors for Regional Schools. Duration wouldbe four weeks. This course would provide potential instructors with the basicinformation they would require for starting Regional Schools.(c) Specialist Technical Courses in the electronic and scientific fields for people who already hold suitable technical qualifications.(ii) Courses to be Run by Regional Schools433. (a) Senior Courses for Gazetted Officers (i.e., down to the rank ofAssistant Superintendent). Duration of this course would be four weeks.Ultimately refresher courses on these lines should also be organised. Thiscourse would give officers detailed knowledge of counter intelligence problems in local territories.(b) Inspectors&apos; Courses. These courses would include Sub-Inspectors andAssistant Inspectors in certain territories where these ranks exist. The syllabuswould be the same as for (a), but the subjects would be handled more simply.Duration would be four weeks. Ultimately refresher courses on these lines shouldalso be organised. The object of this course would be the same a for (a) but ofa lower standard.(c) Special Courses for Other Ranks. These courses would be designed tomeet the requirement for Other Ranks trained in certain specialised techniques,e.g., surveillance. The subjects to be taught and the length of the courses would depend upon local circumstances.
3 SZ z xkxxAPPENDIX IIICOLONIAL POLICE &quot;C&quot; COURSE435. The course should be of four weeks&apos; duration and should be held at theBramshill Wing of the Police College, if possible.436. The course should be attended by not more than 12 Colonial police officers of the rank of Superintendent and above who have attended the &quot; B &quot;Course at the Police College, Ryton-on-Dunsmore.Syllabus(a) Administration437.   Lectures and group study to include:  (i) Deployment and command.(ii) Auxiliary and parallel chains of command.(iii) Supply in its widest sense (including discussion with the Crown Agents).(iv) Transport.(v) Communications.(vi) Emergency training.(vii) Office administration.Assistance for some of these subjects might be sought from the Joint ServicesStaff College and Service Training Establishments.(b) Co-operation with the Armed Services in Time of EmergencyLectures and group study to include:  (i) Military Aid to the Civil Power.(ii) The proper role of police and military in times of emergency and rebellion.(iii) The use. of aircraft in time of emergency and rebellion.(iv) Lessons to be learned from the emergencies in Malaya and Kenya.(v) The studies of various other disturbances involving the use of police andmilitary, e.g., Singapore Riots of 1950.(vi) Demonstrations of the latest types of weapons which might be used bythe police and services in time of emergency, e.g., Major Turp&apos;sdemonstration to the Colonial Commissioners Conference 1954.Visits could be arranged to various Service Establishments such as the School of infantry at Warminster and R.A.F. Stations using helicopters and light aircraft.(c) Civil Defence as it affects the Colonial PoliceA short study of this subject might be arranged with the Civil Defence StaffCollege at Sunningdale Park.(d) IntelligenceA study of the proper position of Colonial Police Special Branches in theCommonwealth Intelligence system as a whole (the training section of the security service (M.I.5) might assist this).(e) Co-operation with other Oversea Service DepartmentsLectures could be given by Colonial Office officials and combined discussionsarranged with officers of other departments attending courses in the UnitedKingdom on such subjects as:  (i) The proper liaison between the administrative service and the police in times of peace and in times of emergency.(ii) The future of native administration police forces and their organisationand training.
APPENDIX IVLOCAL INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES(A) Organisation and Working438. Each Local Intelligence Committee should have a clear charter laying down its functions. These will vary as conditions require, but the following mayserve as a guide:  (a) To consider matters of intelligence policy and to make recommendations to the Governor.(b) To prepare or call for such papers and appreciations on intelligence matters as may be required.(c) To define intelligence targets and to assess success or failure in attainingsuch targets.(d) To furnish guidance to and receive reports from subordinate committees at provincial or district level, where such exist.439. L.I.C.s in the Middle and Far East should maintain liaison with theLLCs in their respective areas, in order to secure the wider perspective and tomake their own contribution to Commonwealth intelligence appreciation.440. All appreciations issued by L.I.C.s should be the joint responsibilityof the committee and should be signed by all the members after consideration indraft.441. Membership of committees should be confined to permanent govern-ment servants. Full (signing) membership should normally be confined to therepresentatives of (a) The Administration.(b) The Security Services.(c) Police and Special Branch.(d) The Armed Services.Officials from other departments should be co-opted to attend meetings as required.442. L.I.C. appreciations and reports will have a strictly limited circulationand dissemination will be controlled on a &quot; need to know &quot; basis. The L.I.C. willbe responsible for ensuring that all information of interest is passed to governmentdepartments or agencies concerned. It should not be necessary to pass summariesor appreciations to other departments of government.443. LLCs will maintain records and minutes of their proceedings and these will be circulated and passed at each meeting of the committee.444. Periodic L.I.C. appreciations and reports will be submitted to theGovernor who will transmit them to the Secretary of State with his commentsor remarks where necessary.(iii) The future of Colonial Police Forces in territories as they develop towards self-government and the protection of these forces against politicalinterference.(iv) Local government in the Colonial Police.(v) The prevention of corruption.(/) Current AffairsLectures by top-class lecturers on Current Affairs and ContemporaryCommonwealth problems.

3S2z   *xxx:\APPENDIX vi the WEST INDIA REGIMENTObject456. For some years past proposals for the re-formation of the West IndiaRegiment have been under consideration, the object being to establish a force oftwo battalions in the Caribbean which would be adequate to meet local internal security requirements and eventually permit the United Kingdom troops at presentin that area to be withdrawn.Background457. The original West India Regiment was raised as part of the British Armyin 1779 and served with distinction during inter alia the Napoleonic, Ashanti andGreat Wars, gaining nine battle honours. In 1919 the disbandment of the Regimentwas first mooted and in 1925 the War Office put it forward again on financial and operational grounds. Despite some resistance from the Government of Jamaica,the proposal was eventually accepted and the Regiment formally disbanded on the31st March, 1927, being replaced by a battalion of British troops.458. During the late war a number of local forces were raised at her majesty&apos;s Government^ expense for the defence of the Caribbean Area, but weregradually disbanded after 1945. In view of local Governments&apos; disappointment atthis development, Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward and Windward Islands,and Trinidad were invited to consider the establishment of a single-battalion toprovide an internal security force for the Southern Caribbean, to be financedDepartmental security448.

locally and drawing its personnel from these five territories. An additional localbattalion v/as to be raised for internal security duties in Jamaica. In the event only.Trinidad was unreservedly in favour of establishing the Southern Caribbeanbattalion and on the 2nd May, 1947, the Overseas Defence Committee agreed thatthere were not sufficient grounds to maintain full-time local forces for internal security purposes in the Southern Caribbean. The proposal for the compositebattalion was accordingly dropped. The proposal for the full-time battalion inJamaica as a United Kingdom commitment was however accepted, and this force is still in existence.459. In April 1949, the Chiefs of Staff assessed the internal security require-ments of the Caribbean Area at two infantry battalions, following which theproposal for a a two-battalion force was revived. It took some time to resolve the initial financial difficulties, as it was clear that West Indian Governments could notbear the whole cost of this force. Eventually it was agreed that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should provide such financial assistance as misht be necessary(through the Colonial Services Vote, not the War Office Vote), and in August 1951,West Indian Governments were invited to agree in principle to the establishment ofa two-battalion force.Present State of the Project460. After inconclusive exchanges with the West Indian Governments overthe ensuing two years it became clear that the proposal to re-form the West IndianRegiment could not be brought to a head unless a definite scheme were placed insome detail before the West Indian Governments and their Legislatures. Theproduction of such a scheme in turn was not made any easier by the absence ofany agreement on the basic principles and by the unavoidable division of administrative responsibility in London between the Colonial Office, the War Officeand Treasury. By agreement between those Departments a despatch was howeversent to all the West Indian Governments by the Secretary of State for the colonies in October 1954 containing proposals of which the following is a summary:  (a) The Regiment to be a mixed West Indian force, consisting of a RegimentalHeadquarters, depot, two infantry battalions and Service elements, foruse within the Caribbean area in an internal security role.(b) The Regiment to be raised by an Act of Parliament, following a resolution of the local legislatures requesting this, to overcome the difficulty of passing thirteen identical local Bills through thirteen separatelegislatures.(c) The War Office to exercise full operational, administrative and financial control over the Regiment as the agent of the West Indian Governments(a local consultative body on which these Governments and the local military Commander would be represented being set up to advise on administrative and financial matters).(d) The War Office to be responsible for planning and approving all expenditure, this being met in part by local contributions (on the basisof one per cent, of the total revenue of each participating territory) andthe balance by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,who would also meet capital costs, less any local contributions made towards these. Any land, plus buildings and services in situ, requiredfor the Regiment would have to be supplied free by the government concerned.(e) Pay and conditions of service should be related to local conditions.(/) West Indian officers should be trained and employed to the greatest extent possible, United Kingdom personnel being made available to meet initialdeficiencies.461. Subsequently agreement has been reached between Departments in theUnited Kingdom on the allocation of responsibility between the Colonial Govern-ments and the War Office for works services, on the outline regimentalestablishment (other than the administrative elements) and on the non-financial conditions of service. These supplementary details are similarly being com-municated to the West Indian Governments for their consideration.462. The despatch of October 1954 concluded by asking the West indian governments and Legislatures whether they would accent the financial commit-ment; whether they agreed that the War Office should be asked to start raising
ZSli xxxx \/the Regiment; and whether they agreed to the necessary legislation being introduced into the United Kingdom Parliament.463. Without agreement on these three essential steps no effective further progress, particularly anything involving financial commitments, can be made.The Regiment will depend on local man-power and (to a considerable extent)local money, and is intended for an internal security role for which it must thereforebe acceptable locally. The willing co-operation of the West Indian governments must therefore be secured. The political and constitutional complications whichthis entails should be recognised. The Secretary of State deals with sevenGovernors on this matter. The Governors of the Leeward and Windward Islandshave in turn each to deal with four separate territories. Barbados, british honduras, Jamaica and Trinidad enjoy advanced constitutions and the legislaturesof all the other territories except British Guiana have unofficial elected majorities,British Guiana&apos;s Legislature being nominated. Among other difficulties is theparochial West Indian outlook, characterised by inter-Island suspicion. This isparticularly noticeable in British Guiana and British Honduras, which are not atpresent participating in the scheme for West Indian federation.464. No official replies have yet been received to the despatch of October1954, but the following indications of progress are available:  Barbados. Ministers are prepared to put Her Majesty&apos;s Government^proposals to the Legislature subject to the financial proviso that the cost ofthe local volunteer forces should be. deducted from the contribution whichBarbados is expected to make towards the West India Regiment. The treasury are prepared to agree to this if no other financial arrangement is likely to be acceptable to the Legislature. An undertaking to this effect has. been askedfor.British Honduras. Ministers are not prepared to accept Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s proposals but are prepared to reconsider them in 1957. TheGovernor reports that there is no prospect of obtaining a majority for theproposals in the Legislature.Trinidad. Executive Council has accepted the proposals, which have alsobeen adopted unanimously by the Finance Committee of the Legislature.Windward Islands. The four Executive Councils agree in principle with her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs proposals but are not prepared to submit them tothe Legislatures until the question of stationing a company of the Regiment inthe Windwards is reopened.Jamaica has recently had a change of government, but opinion is under-stood to be in favour of the scheme. The Leeward Islands have been occupied with constitutional changes. The response from British Guiana is not thought likely to be favourable.465. It looks as if the mainland territories are likely to stay out of the schemeinitially, and are of course those very territories where United Kingdom troops have to be stationed at present. British Guiana and British Honduras must come in if the full benefit is to be derived from this scheme. Although, therefore, it ispossible to make a start with re-forming the Regiment without the initial partici-pation of British Guiana and British Honduras, if they do not participate from the outset it will have far-reaching effects on all planning, e.g., for accommodation ofall natures (some 25 per cent, duplication of barracks, married quarters, stores, &amp;c),and the location of administrative services. It will also considerably increase her majesty&apos;s Governmenfs financial expenditure. The longer British Guiana andBritish Honduras delay after the Regiment starts to be raised, the greater this expenditure and the planning complications will be, and the longer the relief ofUnited Kingdom troops, which is one of the primary objects of this scheme, willbe delayed.. 466. The proposed layout of the re-fprmed West India Regiment wouldbe as follows:-.(a) Jamatca* : Regimental Headquarters and Depot.  One Battalion lessone Company.British Honduras : One Company.(b) Trinidad* :  One Battalion less one Company.British Guiana:  One Company.* Until such time as British Guiana and British Honduras participate in the scheme, temporary accommodation for one extra Company and services in Jamaica and Trinidad respectively should beprovided.
3 52^  -xxxxvTELEGRAM FROM GOVERNOR, CYPRUS, TO SECRETARY OF STATEDated 14 April, 1955.Received on 14 April, 1955.Personal for Secretary of State from General Templer.  Begins: After discussions with Governor, Commissioner of Police, Security ServiceAdviser and Head of Special Branch, I have reached the following conclusions:  (1) Situation is likely to grow worse before it grows better (present lullbeing due to Greek Holy Week).(2) Consequently urgent action in certain respects is still necessary, despitegratifying progress recently made (see Governors Saving telegram No. 563).(3) Priorities are as follows:  (a) Senior Police Staff. Now that a start is to be made with reorganisation and re-equipment, it is essential that it should get off on the right lines,otherwise much money may be wasted. This means that Commissionermust have the officers to cope with it, as follows:  (i) Transport Officer;(ii) Force Communications Officer;(iii) Administrative Planning Officer;(iv) Force Training Officer;(v) Superintendent as Officer Commanding Mobile Reserve;(vi) 3 Divisional Assistant Superintendents.All the above appointments have been approved (except (iii) and(iv) applications for whom are now being made by Commissioner), but none can be filled locally.I suggest urgent steps be taken to recruit these officers immediately.Promising candidate for No. (ii) appears to be Burke from Tanganyika.No. (iv) should be of type of Kane in Malaya. No. (iii) is dealt within Commissioner^ letter to Governor, HQ. 347/39 of 24th January,copied to Stourton.(b) Pay. I appreciate that this cannot be settled overnight.   But it is vital that some visible action should be taken at once. 75 per cent, of force are estimated to be in debt for an average of  150, due solely to increased cost of living. I recommend that it be announced now thatan increase of say 5 per cent, has been granted with immediate effect,as an earnest of Governments intention to tackle problem in 1956estimates. Meanwhile I trust that no discouraging reply will be givento appeal from Cyprus Police Association dated 10th January, andforwarded on the 9th April.(c) Police Quarters. A large proportion of indebtedness referred to above isdue to absence of accommodation, despite recommendation of I.G.sovereignty many years. If recruits for increased establishment are to befound, in face of increasing unpopularity of service due to effect ofenosis campaign in schools, quarters are as necessary as rises in pay.I appreciate that here, too, it is a long job, but I am glad to say thata decision in principle has now been taken that quarters for all policemust be provided by Government; as a visible sign of this decisionyour authority is being sought to provide funds to commence immediateconstruction of 50 married quarters. Remainder of programme shouldbe given high priority.&quot;(d) Intelligence. In general, I hope that the largely technical recommendations made in Security Service Adviser&apos;s Reports, which I have read with interest, will be implemented as soon as possible. In particular, themost urgent requirement is new Interrogation Centre. I am glad tosee that all necessary action is in train here, and I hope that any whichmay be necessary at home will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.Another urgent requirement is a Desk Officer to handle potential doubleagents; this is most important if terrorist agency is to be penetrated,which is best hope of stopping incidents.
(e) Control of Explosives. This is at present inadequate.   I have suggested to Governor that all explosives should only be imported through oneagency, and be held and issued by police as required. . \(f) Office Buildings. Three-storey buildings now planned will be inadequate for increased police and Special Branch requirements. It should befive storeys.2. Above are all urgent matters on which I hope decisions may be takennow. Other minor matters will be dealt with in my report.3. A copy of this is going to the governor who will send you his commentsdirect. He has of course seen it.4. I am sending a separate signal on the subject of a Director of Intelligence.Ends.Governor.
