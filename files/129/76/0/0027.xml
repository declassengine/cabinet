Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1955SECRETCP. (55) 7715th July, 1955CABINETTHE AGRICULTURE ACT, 1947, AND THE agricultural holdings ACT, 1948Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food think that the time has come for a review of:(a) the powers for securing reasonable standards of husbandry and estate management;(b) the provisions for giving security of tenure to tenant farmers.Reasonable Standards of Husbandry and Estate Management2. If farmers or landowners do not comply with minimum standards ofhusbandry or estate management as laid down by the Agriculture Act, 1947, theycan be placed under supervision, given directions, and in the last resort dispossessedof their land. These powers are administered by County Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees and there is an appeal against dispossession to an independentAgricultural Land Tribunal. (Similar arrangements apply under the correspondingAct for Scotland.)3. The philosophy of these powers is that in return for the stability of guaranteed prices, the industry must accept the obligation to comply with certain minimum standards of efficiency enforceable by the State.4. These powers were generally accepted as necessary at the time thelegislation was passed, just after the war. Some people still consider they are a necessary reserve weapon to secure improvements in farming efficiency. But a growing, and influential, section of public opinion (mostly outside the industry)considers such powers to be objectionable, an unreasonable encroachment upon the liberty of the subject, and most difficult to administer fairly as between farmerand farmer.5. The powers were never very widely used. Their administration has nowbeen brought almost to a standstill. Agricultural Executive Committees are becoming increasingly restive because of the uncertainty about the future of themost important statutory functions, which they are responsible for operating.6. I do not think that the present unsatisfactory position can be allowed tocontinue. We must decide either that these powers are still necessary and reasonable and must be exercised in extreme cases or, alternatively, that they are not necessary and should be repealed.Security of Tenure7. The Acts also provide security to the tenant farmer by requiring that if a tenant objects to a notice to quit from his landlord, it does not become effective without the Ministers consent. This must be withheld unless the Minister is satisfied that to grant consent would lead to greater efficiency. Administration is inthe hands of County Agricultural Executive Committees and there is an appeal tothe Agricultural Land Tribunal.8. The philosophy of these provisions is that the good tenant farmer musthave security of tenure to plan his farming operations ahead with confidence.9. These provisions and their administration have been criticised in a numberof quarters as giving too much security to the indifferent farmer and so (a) prejudicing efficiency;(b) putting up agricultural vacant possession values;(c) preventing new blood entering the industry;(d) in the long term tending to bring the system of tenant farming to an end.48407Copy No. 6 4
10. I believe there is substance in these criticisms. I would expect theNational Farmers&apos; Union (N.F.U.) strongly to rebut them. Looking to the future,I consider the restriction of opportunities for farmers&apos; sons and farm workers toacquire farms particularly serious. The whole question needs to be reviewed.Proposal for an Independent Committee of Inquiry11. Both these subjects are highly controversial politically and also withinthe industry itself. In my view the best hope of obtaining impartial consideration for them, and recommendations which have a chance of commanding widespreadsupport, is to set up an independent and authoritative committee of inquiry.12. Such a step would no doubt be criticised by the N.F.U., and also by our political opponents, especially as it was not mentioned in our Election Manifesto.It would be represented that we intended to undermine the whole of the agriculture act of 1947, including the provisions designed to afford stability to the industry.In other quarters I think an inquiry would be welcomed. It could be justified onthe grounds that:  (a) the powers need to be reviewed in the light of present circumstances andthe experience gained during the last seven years;(b) there has been a change in the trend of public opinion which makes itdesirable to re-examine the underlying principles.13. I would suggest terms of reference on the following lines for such acommittee:  &quot; To review:  (i) the present law and practice concerning standards of farming and management of agricultural land; and(ii) the measure and form of security of tenure required by tenant farmers in the interests of efficient food production.And to report.&quot;or as an alternative &quot; To review the present law and practice concerning the standards of farming and management, and security of tenancy, of agricultural land; andto report.&quot;14. The nature of this inquiry calls for a strong Committee, and I thinkthat as Chairman we shall need a lawyer of high standing, or a distinguishedUniversity personage. If it were possible to obtain the services of a High court judge that might be a good solution. I think the other members of the committee might include a landowner, a tenant farmer, a land agent, a business man anda representative of the Trades&apos; Union Congress.15. It would be necessary to arrange with the Chairman that the committee did not encroach on the field covered by the proposed inquiry into problems of administrative law which was proposed in our Manifesto.16. I have consulted the Secretary of State for Scotland who agrees that acommittee should be appointed. While the operation of the powers for securingreasonable standards of husbandry and estate management has attracted lesscriticism in Scotland, the security of tenure provisions have been strongly criticised by landowners and the Secretary of State feels that any inquiry should cover both countries. He does, however, attach considerable importance to the committeebeing an entirely neutral body not containing representatives of either side of theindustry. I suggest that the Secretary of State and I might be left to settle this inthe light of any views that our colleagues may wish to express.Conclusion17.   I ask for the agreement of my colleagues to:  (a) the appointment of a Committee for the purpose explained in thismemorandum; and ,&apos;   (b) the announcement of the decision in the House.D. H. A.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W.1,15th July, 1955.
