(55) 14th Conclusions, Minute 2).I now circulate, for consideration by the Cabinet, a memorandum approved bythis Committee setting out proposals which might be put forward at the conference with the Greek and Turkish Governments.S.

CYPRUSThe United Kingdom invitation to attend a Conference in London has beenaccepted by the Greek and Turkish Governments. The date for the opening ofthe Conference is still under discussion.2. The United Kingdom Delegation will need to have a plan ready to present at an appropriate stage in the discussion. When this stage will come will dependpartly on the tactics we ourselves adopt and partly on the attitudes which theGreek and Turkish representatives take up in discussion.3.   Our objective is to secure an arrangement which:  (a) safeguards our basic political and strategic interests in the eastern mediterranean and Cyprus, and(b) secures at least the acquiescence of the Greek and Turkish Governments,and is accordingly practical politics within Cyprus.4.   Our needs may be summarised as:  (i) a secure position for our Middle East Headquarters and a safe base forthe deployment and supply of a strategic reserve and for staging aircraft;(ii) the maintenance of a physical symbol of British power in the eastern mediterranean and the Middle East;(iii) the maintenance of order and good government in Cyprus and the encouragement of its steady progress towards internal self-government.5. The main Greek objective at the Conference will be to secure recognitionfor the principle of self-determination and its early application to Cyprus.6. The Turkish Government have only recently confirmed to us that they intend to re-state their position in the firmest manner at the Conference. We believethat they are principally concerned:(i) to safeguard the rights of the Turkish community in Cyprus;(ii) to ensure if possible that the island is not handed over to Greece, and inany event not without their consent.It is thus likely to be the first aim of the Turkish Delegates to ensure that theTurkish right to be consulted about the future status of Cyprus is recognised. Theyare likely in addition to press their claim that Turkish agreement is necessary forany change in the status of Cyprus.7. In these circumstances there are, broadly speaking, two possible types ofplan by which we can try to secure a solution. Both types would be based on theimmediate introduction of a new constitution aimed at steady progress towards self-government by the Cypriots in all fields of administration except foreign affairs,defence and police. These would be reserved to the British Governor. In spite ofthe obvious difficulties, both plans could also offer to concede a higher status to therepresentatives of the Greek and Turkish Governments and concessions in culturaland other minor matters. From this common point of departure the two types ofplan diverge as follows:  (i) The first would aim at a permanent settlement by seeking to commit theGreek and Turkish Governments to the. acceptance of continuing british sovereignty and British responsibility for Foreign Affairs and defence(including police), at the price of some association of the Greek and turkish Governments in the administration of Cyprus. Such a plan would, if accepted, have to be embodied in a formal agreement or treaty between the three Governments.(ii) The second type would accept that we should review the future status of cyprus at &quot;the end of a definite period, subject to conditions regardingthe state of the world and the adequate attainment of self-government by the Cypriots. This would amount to an implicit recognition ofCypriot self-determination in an indefinite future. It would involvegiving an undertaking to consult, after x years with the (elected) CypriotGovernment concerning the future status of Cyprus. It might alsobe necessary to seek the view of the Greek and Turkish Governments.Illustrations of the first type of plan are at Annex A; and of the second type at annex B.
8. A solution of the first type would probably be accepted readily enough bythe Turkish Government, since it implies the indefinite retention of british sovereignty. In these conditions, the Turks would doubtless be prepared to acceptthe risk of friction resulting from the association of Greeks with the Cyprusadministration. The Greek Government on the other hand can only be expectedto accept a settlement of the first type in good faith if they can first be broughtto change their position fundamentally. For by acquiescing in such a settlementthey would in fact be recognising the permanence of British sovereignty andabandoning their demand for self-determination. If, contrary to expectation, the.Greek Government were prepared to accept such a settlement, this would have arestraining effect on the majority of Greek Cypriots. But there would probably bea residue of unreconciled Cypriot nationalists who would continue to demandEnosis and who might need to be dealt with by force. In any case, the governor and his principal advisers, including the Greek and Turkish members of his executive Council, are impressed with the extreme practical difficulty of workingsuch a system. It might moreover offer tempting opportunities for Enosist agitationby a Greek Government which was dissatisfied with its working.9. If an arrangement of the second tvpe were proposed, the Greeks would doubtless argue strongly in favour of a shorter time limit than we could concede.They would also resent the fact that our pledge to consultation after the statedperiod was tied to the achievement of Cypriot self-government in the meantime.(The Greeks have consistently agitated in favour of a plebiscite.) Nevertheless, itseems probable that the Greek Government, under pressure of moderate opinionalarmed at the wider repercussions of the dispute, could be brought to accept asettlement on the lines proposed. Conversely the Turks would be suspicious andreluctant. But they might be brought to acquiesce on the clear understanding thatno eventual change in the status of Cyprus would be made without the turkish governments consent. That is to say, they would agree provided they had a rightof veto when the time came for a decision.10. The first task of the United Kingdom Delegation in the forthcoming discussions, after describing in general terms our own basic requirements, will beto probe the Greek and Turkish positions. (A note on possible tactics is at annex C.) When the Greek and Turkish views, and the differences between them,have been clearly defined, the Delegation will require to table a plan of one of thetwo types described above. In choosing between the two types of plan, we must bear in mind that if we tabled unsuccessfully the second type, the first type (whichpostulates the co-operation of the Greek and Turkish Governments) would be useless as a fall-back position since it is so markedly less favourable to the Greekthesis. On the other hand if we decided to propose initially the first type of planthen, in the event of its rejection, it would be possible to proceed to offer the secondtype. But this would be taken as evidence of a retreat by Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment under Greek pressure, and if done at the Conference would expose us tofurther pressure from the Greek Government, e.g., over the time factor.Accordingly, if it became desirable to proceed to the second type after the failureof the first type, then it would arguably be preferable to break off the conferenceand immediately afterwards to put the essentials of the plan into effect by anunilateral declaration or &quot; award &quot; by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.11. We seek the views of the Cabinet on the proper course for the UnitedKingdom Delegation to follow at the conference, and in &quot;particular on which of thealternative broad types of plan they should have discretion to propose at theappropriate moment.48453
annex APLANS OF THE FIRST TYPEBasic PlanSovereignty would remain with the. British Crown but a special position wouldbe given to representatives appointed by the Greek and Turkish Governments.2. The Governor would be obliged to consult these representatives regularlyin the exercise of his duties under the Constitution including his responsibilities for defence, police and external relations. But the decisions would be his own, andin his absence his powers would devolve on his British deputy as Acting Governor.The three Governments would establish joint machinery to settle any differences which arose out of the operation of these arrangements. [In the last resortGovernments might have certain rights to refer matters of importance to theCouncil of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.] [The Greek and Turkish flagswould fly officially alongside the Union Jack.]3. A new Constitution would be introduced providing for an advanced formof self-government with:  (i) an elected Legislature, with seats reserved for the Turkish minority and forthree officials;(ii) a Council of Ministers, of whom the majority would be chosen by theGovernor from the members of the Legislature, after consultation with members of the Legislature.4. Foreign Affairs, defence and police would be reserved to the Governor,but other Departments would be progressively transferred to Cypriot Ministers.The independence of the Judiciary, and the terms of service for civil servants wouldbe safeguarded in the Constitution.5. The Assembly would enjoy full freedom of debate, but any Bill which inthe Governors opinion sought to amend the Constitution or affected the rights of minorities would have to be reserved for the Royal Assent.6. Her Majesty&apos;s Government would undertake to review these arrangementsafter [five] years in consultation with the then Council of Ministers and with theGreek and Turkish Governments. We should aim at maintaining the plan for say,twenty years.7. There should be an instrument or treaty recognising the paramount importance of Cyprus for common defence in present conditions and establishing the special position of the Greek and Turkish representatives. There could alsobe Anglo-Greek and Anglo-Turkish cultural conventions giving the Greek and turkish representatives defined responsibilities in relation to their owncommunities.ANNEX BPLANS OF THE SECOND TYPE(a) Basic plan the Greek and Turkish representatives at the Conference would be informedthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government intend to introduce a new and liberal constitutionleading to full internal self-government to be accompanied by the following provisions and arrangements:  (i) the progressive transfer to Cypriot Ministers of Departments of the CyprusGovernment with the exception of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Policewhich would be reserved to the Governor;(ii) safeguards for minorities;(iii) a declaration that when full self-government was working satisfactorilyand international conditions permitted it would be the definite purposeof Her Majesty&apos;s Government to reach agreement with theconstitutionally-elected representatives of the Cypriot people about thefuture status of the island;
(iv) an undertaking to review the position with the [Cypriot Council ofMinisters] or [representatives of the Cypriot people] in [ten] years time;[(v) a possible offer to discuss with the Greek and Turkish Governmentsmatters arising out of the special cultural and other links between thesetwo countries and Cyprus.](b) Possible Variants2. There could be added to the arrangements in paragraph 1 above anundertaking to associate the Governments of Greece and Turkey with the review inten years time, if that appeared essential to Greek and Turkish acceptances of theplan.3. If either Government had a grievance which could not be solved locallyby their representatives in the island, the two Governments would be accorded theright to make representations to Her Majesty&apos;s Government in London.4. Her Majesty&apos;s Government might possibly also tell the Greek and turkish governments that if their grievances had not been removed after consultation with her Majesty&apos;s Government no objection would be taken to their ventilating thematter in the Council of Europe.ANNEX CCYPRUS NEGOTIATIONSTactics and TimetableThe following considerations should be taken into account:  (a) The Greeks will naturally suspect us of wishing to keep them dangling. Sowe must not give them cause for complaint on this score.(b) But subject to this, we should try to keep the negotiations going as long aspossible. We want to give tempers time to cool and we want if possibleto go on talking so long as the United Nations Assembly is in session.(c) We must be careful not to gang up with the Turks or stimulate theirresistance to self-determination. Otherwise the Russians will probablyget to hear of it and will inform the Greeks with damaging results. Butwe must try to devise a procedure which will make it certain that theTurks state their position clearly.(d) Finally we should bear in mind that the terms of our invitation envisagea conference &quot; on political and defence questions which affect theEastern Mediterranean including Cyprus.&quot;2.   It is suggested accordingly that we should proceed as follows:  (a) There would be only one meeting a day.(b) At the first meeting we should explain why we had called the conference:we are all allies in N.A.T.O.; we have a common interest in an effectivedefence in the West; as allies we have a similar interest in settling any difference which threatens our unity and consequently our defence system. Unfortunately the issue of Cyprus has clouded our relations and threatens to do worse. We must make an effort to settle it.3. In the hope of finding a solution we suggest that the most practical coursewill be for each of the parties to state their views on the whole problem and to define their position. Only when this has been done can we accurately gauge theextent of our problem and consider ways and means of bridging any differences between us. We suggest that as host Government we might begin and be followedby the Greek and Turkish representatives in that order.4. We would then make a statement comprising a review of the strategicsituation in the Eastern Mediterranean, and a statement of our defence requirements.After the Greek statement the Turks would, we hope, make their position clear.
5. The next stage would be for us to define in writing the differences betweenthe three Governments and to make sure that the other two agreed with the definition.6. When this had been done, probably not without some argument ondrafting, we should say that we must now address ourselves to the task of reconciling the differences by a process of compromise. We might suggest an adjournment of ten days for reflection and offer to table compromise proposals on resumption (on the lines of Annex A or B, or whatever the Cabinet may decide). We might have to ask subsequently for an extension of the adjournment.7. In its second stage the conference would consider our compromise proposal and any other proposal which the Greeks or Turks might have concocted.8. Our plan might be rejected. In that event we might propose somevariant of it. Or we might say that having failed to reach agreement we would decide unilaterally what to do and make our statement.9. Or the delegates might judge it necessary to refer our plan to the greek and Turkish Governments. In that event we should have to adjourn, possiblyuntil after the opening of the Assembly and the post-Geneva meeting of the FourForeign Ministers. This would suit us.10. Or our plan might be pronounced worthy of further study. In that case we could appoint a sub-committee charged with the task of translating our plan into an agreed statement and Ministers would only meet again when a drafttext was ready.11. Throughout the negotiations our aim would be to bring the Greeks up against the Turkish refusal to accept Enosis and so condition them to accept asolution which would leave sovereignty in our hands until at least there wastripartite agreement to make a change.
