jHIRE-PURCI-IA.SEMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeCOPY NO.CABINETOh 12th Jttly, the Cabinet invited the Chancellor of the exchequer to report further on the economic situation in the light of consultations with me and with, the other Ministers concerned (C,M.(55) 22nd Conclusions^Minute 3).2. The Chancellor and I have been considering what further restrictions could be imposed on hire-purchase as part of the measuresto restrict credit and restrain inflationary pressure.3. We have not thought it wise to tighten the restrictions overthe whole field, since this would seriously aggravate the difficulties ofthose industries which have already been hit (e, g, furniture).    We suggestinstead more severe terms for a wide range of goods which the restrictionshave not, so far as we can judge, greatly affected.    In doing this, we arenot singling out these particular goods to assist exports, to save scarcematerials or because they may be thought less essential than the others,We have chosen them because they seem to offer the best chance ofsqueezing out some further consumer credit.    The aim of the controlremains, broadly, to reduce the quantity of purchases made from borrowed money, not to hit at particular industries.4. We propose to raise the minimum deposit from 15 per cent to33V3 per cent for the following goods :-Radio and television sets, and gramophones.Domestic appliances - gas and electric fires (butnot cookers), electric washing machines, vacuumcleaners, refrigerators, sewing machines, wringers,irons, etc.Cameras and binoculars.Cars, motor-cycles and power-assisted cycles.We do not propose to shorten the pex*iod for payment below two years05. Any such selective list must be rough and ready, and we wouldnot defend in detail the inclusion of these items or the exclusion of otherscThe inclusion of domestic appliances (except cookers) may well come in; for special attack, probably on the grounds that it will lessen incentive and,retard the improvement in the standard of living of the better paid woske^s^Domestic appliances, however, account for a substantial and rising volumeof consumer expenditure and, as this is a field where hire-purchaseflourishes, it is right to make borrowing there more difficult.SECRETC0Po(55) 8519th July, 1955
63 We have considered the possibility of raising the minimumdeposit for cars still further.,    The Chancellor would on balance favourincreasing the initial deposit to 40 per cent.    This, however, would almost certainly involve issuing a great many individual licences forexceptions, e. g, to doctors, and midwives, small professional menworking on their own account, car hire firms catering for the touristtrade, which I am anxious to avoid.    It would also have the disadvantage of adding a third tier of deposits and so detracting further   from thesimplicity which has so far been an asset of the control.    This is by nomeans an easy measure to defend on any basis a.nd the more complex thecontrol the more difficult it is to defend.7. The higher we drive the deposit, the greater the incentive to evasion, e. g. through hiring.    A deposit of 33^/3 per cent is probably the limit, and even at this level there will certainly be an increase inevasions.    It is important that the nationalised industries should not seta bad example by switching to large-scale hiring, and it might be desirable for the Minister of Fuel and Power to use his influence to prevent this.8. I must warn my colleagues that the restrictions which we are proposing may cattse unemployment in certain firms, particularly thosewhich specialise in the mtanufacture of domestic appliances.    We mustbe prepared to face more instances of the sort of trouble that we havebeen having with the furniture industry.    This must all be seen, however,against the background of very high employment in industry generally and indeed a recovery in the furniture industry.9. If my colleagues agree that these further restrictions shouldbe imposed, the Chancellor will announce them in the comprehensive statement on the economic situation which he proposes to make beforethe House rises.    I will then make the necessary Order to come intoforce immediately.    This procedure will explain the restrictions in their proper context and avoid any forestalling by traders.P.T..Board of Trade, S.W.1,19th July, 1955.i i
