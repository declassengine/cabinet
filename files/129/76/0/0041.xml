(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENT)confidential..P0(55) 9123rd July, 1955CABINETCOPY NO.NEW PARK LANE scheme memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation the Home Affairs Committee have on several occasions since10th December last considered the new Park Lane Scheme,    A shortsummary of the scheme and a map are attached as Appendices 1 and 2.2.        On 20th July (H.P.(55) 9th Meeting, Item 3) the Home AffairsCommittee  -(i) Invited the Minister of Transport to find out what would be the London County Councils (L0C.C.)attitude if the Government were to approve inprinciple their plan for relieving traffic congestion in Park Lane and its environs subjectto the plan including an underpass at Hyde ParkCorner.(ii)  Invited the Minister of Transport to submit to theCabinet their recommendation that the L,C.C.?scheme should be approved, on condition that theL.C.C. agreed to the construction of an underpassat Hyde Park Corner.\3.        I have ascertained informally that the L.C0C., who are the promoters of the scheme, would be prepared to include the construction ofan underpass at Hyde Park Corner if the Government approved the scheme on that basis.4.        In accordance with the Home Affairs Committee,s decision i therefore submit this question to the Cabinet.5.       An improvement in traffic arrangements in this area is urgently necessary.    At the traffic census undertaken in July, 1954s Flyde ParkCoraer was shown to have by far the largest traffic  Low in London with81,446 vehicles passing between 8 a. m. and 8 p0m0 , some 15,000 morethan the next busiest place,,    Moreover, Marble Arch, at the other endof the proposed improvement has9 with a traffic  Low of 58,710 vehicles3the third heaviest traffic movement in London.60 I regard this area as the place most urgently requiring road works in the United Kingdom.7.        This view appears to be generally shareds    In a Home Affairspaper, HoA0(55) 4, dated as long ago as 14th January, the Home Secretarystated that in the opinion of the Commissioner of Police the Hyde Park
Boulevard Scheme (as it was then called) was about the most urgent ofthe schemes in contemplation for easing the flow of London traffic.The Commissioner of Police in his annual report submitted subsequentlystated that in his view the highest priority should be given to this improvement scheme.,    The L.C.C, have been pressing strongly for sememonths for approval to be given to the scheme and the Opposition in theHouse of Commons, notably Mr, Herbert Morrison, have taken the sameline.8.       Since this matter first came before the Home Affairs Committeein December the details of the scheme have been intensively examined by, among others, the Road Research Laboratory, Commissioners of Crown Lands, the L.C.C., Westminster City Council, St. MaryleboneBorough Council, the Metropolitan Police and officials both of theMinistry of Works and of my Department.9.       A difference of opinion has existed between the experts as towhether it would be necessary to include the underpass at Hyde ParkCorner from the beginning or whether it would be sufficient to constructthe roundabout in the first place adding the underpass later, if necessary.Both the Road Research Laboratory and my own road engineers have considered that it would be desirable to include the underpass from thebeginning, whereas the L.C.C. who are the promoting authority, and, asI understand it, the Metropolitan Police,have favoured leaving the under&quot;pass for later construction.10.      However, as stated above the L.C.C. are now prepared, if thescheme is sanctioned, to accept the desirability of including the under-pass from the beginning.11.      I should add that the Ministry of Works have discussed the schemeinformally with the Royal Fine Arts Commission who have expressed theview that the traffic advantages to be gained from the scheme were out&quot;weighed by the necessity to preserve the amenities of the Royal Parks.The consideration of traffic needs is not of course within the terms ofreference of the Royal Fine Arts Commission.    However, in considering this matter I think it is right that my colleagues should know the opinionof the Commission.12.      In view of the facts set out above, of the long period which hasbeen taken in detailed examination of the scheme, and of the steady increasein London traffic there is now great urgency in proceeding with this scheme0London traffic is in my judgment already very near the point at whichreally serious stoppages are likely frequently to arise, and public opinion is rightly impatient of further delays in major road improvements inLondon.    This scheme is not only of itself the most important but, by improving conditions at and between Hyde Park Corner and Marble Archjties up with the proposed Notting Hill Gate improvement and theCromwell Road Extension in a major plan for improving the western approaches to London013D      The actions for which I seek the approval of the Cabinet ares-(i)  That the Minister of Works should be invited to make a formal submission to Her Majesty in order to ascertain whether she is willing to confirm the approval whichHis Late Majesty gave to the scheme in its earlierformc    I understand that informally Sir Michael Adeaneis aware of the present position.
36^(ii)  That subject to Her Majesty&apos;s gracious approval Ishould inform the London County Council ofHer Majesty&apos;s Governments approval of thescheme^ subject to the inclusion of the underpass.(iii)  That I should be authorised to prepare the necessaryhybrid Bill to provide certain of the powers required,,TC.A c.c* - C .Ministry of Transport, W. 1.22nd July, 1955.APPENDIX 1The Hyde Park Ccheme provides for the conversion ofPark Lane into a one-way road going south and the East Carriage Driveinto a one-way road going north,.    The East Carriage Drive would cease to be part of Hyde Park, whose railings would be moved to the west ofthe road.    The two one-way roads would be separated by a centralreserve.2.        A large roundabout would be constructed at Hyde Park Corner.This would involve taking a small corner of the grounds of buckingham palace - all of it outside the inner wall - and two or three Crownproperties east of Apsley House.    The proposed underpass would runfrom east to west between Piccadilly and Knightsbridge030        The re-organisation of the roundabout arrangements atMarble Arch would also be required,4.        The cost of the scheme is estimated at  1% millions exclusive of the underpass which would cost approximately a further  1 million,The rate of grant payable is 75 per cent.
