The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No. J 2C.P.(55) 659th July, 1955CABINETTHE ECONOMIC situation memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee has discussed a Report on balance of Payments Prospects - June, 1955 (E.P. (55) 22) now circulated as C.P. (55) 68.    The salient facts are attached as an Appendix to this paper.    In my opinion some further move is necessary in order to reverse the deterioration which has taken place in our balance ofpayments.    This paper, read with the Report on Balance of&quot;PaymentsProspects and the minutes of the Economic Policy Committee(E.P. (55) 5th Aieeting, Item 1) is designed as a guide to discussion.I reserve the opportunity of making oral comments and additions.2.        The deterioration in our overseas balance has come&quot;about ata time when world conditions could hardly be more favourable to theUnited Kingdom.    World trade is expanding rapidly and at the sametime the terms of trade are not moving against us; and yet the UnitedKingdom is barely in balance instead of achieving the substantial &quot;surplus necessary to meet all its commitments and responsibilities.Against this background the situation revealedis all the more disturb-ing and calls for action.3.        My colleagues will recall that the likelihood that the situation would develop very much on the lines now described by the Committeeon Balance of Payments Prospects was understood early this year.The primary reason&quot; for the deterioration in our balance of paymentshas been a large rise in imports, considerably greater than the smallrise in exports.    The measures of 24th February, namely the higherbank rate, credit restriction and restriction of hire&quot; pur chase, were designed to reduce the excessive level of internal demand which wasboth drawing in excessive imports and discouraging a greater expansion in exports.    These measures which are necessarily only slow in their operation have progressively had some effect in reducing overalldemand.    But, on the other side, wage increases in the first six monthsof this year were considerably larger than we had anticipated and the strikes (particularly the dock strike) have lost us some exports for goods and delayed others.    The measures of 24th February willcontinue to have increasing effect and, in particular, I have recently had very satisfactory talks with the Chairman and Deputy Chairmanof the Clearing Banks Association, which satisfied me that theGovernment is having their full co-operation in operating the creditsqueese.
4.        I have no doubt that our action was on the right lines and whensupplemented in other specific ways, such as by the increase in theprices of coal and sugar, and the increased rates of interest on local loans, is &quot;capable &quot;in due course of lessening the internal pressure.It is, however, being considerably impaired&apos; in its effect by the apparentexemption fr&apos;0&quot;m the policy of restraint of the development programmes ofthe Government and other public bodies (i. e. nationalised industries andlocal authorities).5.       What is really wrong with the economy is that we are trying todo &quot;so &quot;much at borne that we are finding real difficulty in balancing our overseas accounts.    We must slow down&quot;the rate&apos;at which We areincurring new commitments.    I therefore propose &quot;that, after Consulta-tion with the Departments and nationalised industries concerned,expansion in this sphere should be limited.6.      &apos; I think we should also consider whether the nationalised industries could not raise more of the finance they require from theirown resources, for example by making more adequate provision for depreciation.7.       At the same time, besides the above action on the development programmes of the nationalised industries and local authorities, it willbe necessary in &quot;support of our policy to keep the closest watch on other government experiditure,and especially Government expenditure overseas.,The Minister of Defence and I welcome the setting up by the secretaries of State for War and Air of working parties to enquire respectively intoArmy and Air expenditure in Germany in view of the approaching with-drawal of &quot;support costs&quot;.&quot; 8.     &quot; If action on the above lines is not taken (or if it is taken andnevertheless the policy of credit restriction proves inadequate) theonly alternative will be a direct attack on consumer expenditure withthe attendant risk of stimulating wage claims.    Some items such as theabolition of the bread subsidy and a substantial increase of purchase tax could be taken without legislation, but in the event of the inflationcontinuing there might be no escape from more drastic measuresinvolving legislation in the autumn.9.       I ask my colleagues to co-operate with me in&quot;carrying out thepolicy in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 above.    twill, after reflection and discussion, consider whether an announcement should be made inParliament and, if so, what form it should take.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.8th July, 1955.
appendix the salient facts are that the United Kingdom&quot; overall current balance, which exceeded  300 millions in 1953/54, is&apos; estimatedrto have declined to one of  50 millions in 1954/55, and is forecast to be slightly worse in 1955/56.    The gold and dollar reserves&quot; of the sterling area increased by  230 millions in 1953/54 but decreased by 120  millions in 1954/55a    The reserves now stand at  957 millions;and the&apos; forecast is that there might be a further loss of  100 millionsor more in 1955/56.The non-sterling surplus of the rest of the sterling area hasalso fallen by  100 millions in 1954-/55 and is forecast to continue at about the same level, although some slight improvement is possible.
