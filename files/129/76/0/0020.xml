1V(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(55) 70 COPY NO.   /11th. July, 1955CABINETTHE EUROPEAN FUND - privileges and IMMUNITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsAgreement was reached at the Ministerial meeting of the Council ofthe Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) on 9th and10th June that under certain conditions the European Payments &quot;Union (E.P.U0)might be wound up and that there should be established a European Fund ableto provide short-term credit to members in temporary balance of payments difficulties (CtP7(55) 42).    It was also agreed that an attempt should be madeto reach agreement on a system of multilateral compensation which could continue after the winding up of the E,P. U.2.       Discussions are now proceeding in Paris on the cortstitition of thisEuropean Fund and on possible methods of multilateral settlement.    Inaccordance with the instructions of the O.E.E.C. Council,&quot;agreement shouldbe reached by 15th July, with a view to the signature of the necessaryInstrument(s) by 31st July.    This time-table may, however, not be achieved.3i       The draft legal text for the establishment of the&quot; European Fund nowunder discussion in Paris provides that the Fund should enjoy the sameprivileges and immunities as did the E.P. U.    It is probable that a similarclause will be required for any multilateral compensation agency which maybe established by a separate Instrument.4.        The&quot;privileges and immunities which were accorded by Order inCouncil to the E.P. U., and which would now be needed for the EuropeanFund&quot; (and possibly for the Multilateral Compensation Agency) are very limited.    They consist only of immunity from suit and legal process forthe Union itself and freedom from taxes and rates on its&quot;&quot; assets.    I attachas an Annex to this paper the relevant paragraphs of the Order in council which granted these privileges and immunities to the E.F. U. (S.I, 1954No. 1472),-   It will be observed that no privileges or immunities are accorded thereby to any individual.    The reason for this is that theE.P. U. is controlled by a Managing Board of members of nationaldelegations to the O.E.E.C, and operates through an agent, the Bank for international Settlements.    In consequence, it has no staff of its own.&quot;&quot;The position of the European Fund, and Multilateral Compensation Agency,would be similar.
7i04.       I draw this matter to the attention of my colleagues in accordancewith Minute 6 of the 75th Cabinet Conclusions of 31st July, 1952, and seektheir approval to -(a) the inclusion in the Agreement or Agreementsestablishing the European Fund (and anyMultilateral Compensation Agency) of anArticle defining the privileges and&quot;immunities of the Fund (and CompensationAgency);(b) the submission to Parliament in due course ofa draft Order or Orders in&quot; Council based onthat Agreement or Agreements,H. M.Foreign Office, S.W.1.11th July, 1955.annex.        The European Payments Union (hereinafter referred to as theUnion) is an organisation of which Her Majes&quot;ty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom and the governments of foreign sovereign Powers are members.2; The Union shall have immunity from suit and legal process,except in so far as in any particular case it has expressly waived itsimmunity. &quot; No waiver of immunity shall be deemed to extend to any measure of executicn.3.        The Union shall have the like exemption or relief from taxes and rates, other than taxes on the importation of goods, as is accorded to aforeign sovereign Power.
