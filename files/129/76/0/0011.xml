I&quot;7%(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 614th July, 1955RETIREMENT OF VICE -AD MIRAL J. HUGHES HALLETTMemorandum by the Attorney general in view of paragraph 6 of CP. (55) 56, I should make it clearthat in referring to &quot;the doubts which exist&quot; the Law Officers and Counselmean the legal doubts to which they drew attention.2.        While we appreciated that conceding the Admiral&apos;s claim mightconstitute a precedent which would make it difficult to resist other claimswhether by members of the Forces or by Civil Servants for damages forwrong advice negligently given by their superior officers, our advice thatthis claim should if possible be settled was not based upon this consider-ation.3.        The Admiral!s claim as put forward by his solicitors &quot;is for damages for negligence;  i. e. for wrong advice negligently given.    It isnot a claim for retired pay.    We have advised that it is in our view clearthat the Admiral cannot successfully sue for his retired pay.    In thecircumstances I do not know the basis for the view expressed in paragraph 5of C. P, (55) 56 that the Admiral might add a claim for the higher rate of pay &quot;and that would raise legal issues which it was most desirable toavoid&quot;.4.x       It was present to our minds that litigation in the Courts might lead to publicity of a character it was desirable if possible to avoid.That was the reason why we suggested that arbitration might be a possible course and I do not understand why it is thought that it would be undignifiedfor the Crown to agree to arbitration.5.       A plaintiff who is suing for damages is under a duty to minimise,so far as he reasonably can, the damage that he suffers.    If beforeadoption the Admiral had withdrawn at the request of the Admiralty andresumed his service, he would have been able to earn his retired pay andwould not have suffered any damage as a result of the wrong advice givento him.    But a plaintiff is under no obligation to injure his character, his business or his property to reduce the damages payable by the wrong-doer.Whether the Admiral should in the circumstances have withdrawn is anice question of fact.R.E.M-B.COPY NO.CABINET4th July, 1955Law Officers1 Department, W.C.2.
