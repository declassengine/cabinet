SECR E TAgreement relating to the Transferof the Simonstovm Naval Base1.     Consequent upon the intention of the Union Government to expand theSouth African Navy as described in the /accompanying - deleted throughoutboth Agreements/ Agreement on defence of sea routes round Southern Africa,and in order that the Union Government may be able to provide adequatelogistic support for their expanded Navy, the United Kingdom government agree to hand over to the Union Government the administration and controlof the Naval Base at Simonstown in accordance with the provisions which follow.2.     It is agreed that the Royal Navy will continue to require the useof facilities at the base in peace and in war. The Union Government agreethat the facilities of the base will be available for use by ihe royal navy in peace and by the Royal Navy and navies allied to it in any warin which the United Kingdom is involved,   /if the Union is a co-belligerent,it will naturally follow that the Royal Navy and its allies will enjoyfull use^of the maritime facilities of the Union, not only at Simonstown -deleted^/3.     In a war in which the Union is a co-belligerent, priority in theallocation of space and facilities in the base between the two navies willbe settled by mutual consultation between the Commander-in-Chief of the strategic zone referred to in the Agreement on the defence of sea routesround Southern Africa and the South African Naval Chief of Staff, asstrategic and operational needs may require.4.     The expansion of the South African Navy will necessitate theprovision for use in war of naval facilities beyond the capacity ofSimonstown, so as to ensure that the facilities of the base will in fact be available, to the extent required, for use by the Royal Navy and itsallies in any war in which the United Kingdom, but not the Union, is involved.   To this end the Union Government will take, if necessary inpeace, any measures required to ensure the availability of additional facilities elsewhere in the Union for use by the South African Navy ina war in which the United Kingdom, but not the Union, is involved.5.     The Union Government will maintain the facilities of the base atSimonstown in a state of efficiency not inferior to that existing atthe time of transfer.6.     The Union Government recognise that the replacement of UnitedKingdom personnel of the base by South African personnel must be a gradual and controlled process.   Detailed proposals for this replacementare at Annex A.   The Union Government will continue normally to sendSouth African personnel to the United Kingdom for training in dockyardand armament supply work.7.     The Union Government will give to United Kingdom personnel lentby the Admiralty conditions of service not less favourable than those set out at Annex B.   In connection with the condition that suchpersonnel should not be required to learn Afrikaans, the UnionGovernment will take measures to ensure that no difficulty arises inpractice from the use of English by these personnel.&apos; y &apos;&quot;; &apos;
S E G BE 1.(2)8.     In order to ensure that the standard of efficiency of the base ismaintained, the Union Government agree to retain at least the present standard for the entry and training of locally-entered apprentices, andfor the recruitment of skilled and semi-skilled labour generally,9.     The Union Government confirm /agree/7: -(a) that there will be no bar to the recruitment andemployment of non-Europeans.*&quot;  /if there is a deficiency of qualified European labour, non-Europeans of the required standard will be recruited on a basis of meritj/&apos;(b) that there will be no discrimination based on colourin the rates of pay for comparable jobs.   (This is thepresent practice in the Cape Province);(c) that non-Europeans, once recruited, will have the samesecurity of tenure as Europeans (this is the present practice in the Union).10.   The Union Government agree that no locally-entered employee in service in the base at the date of transfer will be discharged except for seriousmisconduct, inefficiency, or redundancy.   The conditions of service andsuperannuation rights of locally-entered civilian personnel in admiralty service when transfer occurs will be not less favourable than those setout at Annex C.11.   The Union Government agree to expand the facilities of the base tothe extent necessary to ensure the fulfilment of this Agreement, taking into acoount the expansion of the South African Navy referred to in theAgreement on defence of sea routes round Southern Africa.   Detailedparticulars of the measures required are set out in Annex D.12.   In peace the refit and docking programmes at Simonstown will besettled directly between the Royal Naval Caranander-in-Chief, SouthAtlantio, and the South African Naval Chief of Staff.   The UnionGovernment will send vessels of the South African Navy acquired from theUnited^Kingdom to the United Kingdom for such refits as cannot be under-taken at Simonstown Dockyard.13.   It is agreed that the Royal Naval Commander-in-Chief, south atlantic, will retain his present responsibilities for, and authority over, the W/T installations known as Slangkop, KLaver, and Cape Eastuntil a date to be decided by mutual agreement, when the South AfricanNavy can provide the officers and senior ratings together with themajority of the remaining communications personnel.   After the transferof the W/T installations, the Union Government will continue to fulfil the requirements of the world-wide wireless organisation of the royal navy and will provide the Commander-in-Chief with the necessary facilities for that purpose; they will also continue to employ royal naval personnel for the maintenance of equipment at the twotransmitting stations until, by mutual agreement, the South AfricanNavy are able to provide all the officers and men required for thispurpose.   The Union Government will, in the event of a war in which theUnited Kingdom, is involved, place the command and control of the W/Tinstallations in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief.S E C R E T
SECRET(3)14.   Arrangements will be made by mutual agreement between the twoGovernments to settle, on the lines suggested in the report of theJoint Working Party submitted in November, 1954, miscellaneous questions arising out of the transfer of the control and administration of the base.These will include the use of detention quarters, recreational amenities,the dockyard church, the sick bay, and the chart depot, the establishmentof distributing authorities, and questions of naval discipline.15* &apos; The Royal Navy will wish to store certain strategic reserves ofammunition (approximately 2,500 tons) at Ganspan after the armament depotthere has been transferred to the Union Government, in addition to 500tons of Royal Naval ammunition that it will be necessary to store atSimonstown.   The Union Government agree in principle to this, subject to conditions to be determined.16.   Financial arrangements: still under discussion by officials.17-   It is agreed that the necessary detailed preparations fpjc transferwill be put in hand immediately upon the signing of this Agreement andwill be completed as soon as possible.    In particular, the UnionGovernment will at once appoint officers to understudy the CaptainSuperintendent of the Dockyard and the Chief Engineer.   It is further agreed that transfer of administration and control will take place assoon as all the necessary preparations have been made, but in any casenot later than 51st March, 1957.   If. however, it should become apparent that all the necessary preparations cannot be completed by that date,the two Governments will consult together on the measures to be taken./The transfer of the administration and control of the base will takeplace three years from the date of this Agreement, or sooner if it should prove practicable to make all the necessary detailed preparatoryarrangements; these will proceed as quickly as possible^/18.   It is agreed that the terms of this Agreement, except when theyspecifically modify the report of the Joint Working Party submitted inNovember 1954, shall be regarded as amplified by that report.19. This Agreement will remain in force until such time as the -faroGovernments decide otherwise by mutual agreement&apos;..Znew paragraph/-&quot;J^jote   -   throughout this Agreement and its Annexes the word&quot;Admiralty&quot; shall be interpreted as referring to theBritish Admiralty./AnnexSECRET
SECEETANNEX AReplacement of United Kingdom Personnel &quot;by South African PersonnelThe replacement of personnel from the United Kingdom employed in the base by South African personnel must, it is agreed, be governed by the need to ensure that the efficiency of the base is maintained.   Initially, anduntil South African personnel have acquired sufficient knowledge and.experience, most of the posts at present filled by United Kingdom non-industrial or industrial staff will have to continue to be so filled.   Itwill be necessary for volunteers from the United Kingdom to come forward for tours of duty under the Union Government; conditions of service forpersonnel lent to the Union Government will be not less favourable than those set out in Annex B.2.     As an exception to this general principle, however, South AfricanOfficers will be appointed to understudy the existing United Kingdom officersin certain appointments, including those of Captain Superintendent of the dockyard and Chief Engineer, for varying minimum periods.   Such an arrangement will not be possible in the posts of the Heads of the Constructive, ArmamentSupply, and Works Departments, these posts will have, together with themajority of the rest at present filled by United Kingdom staff in all thedepartments of the Dockyard, to be filled by Admiralty employees on loanuntil such time as these can be replaced by South African personnel with thenecessary qualifications and experience.   The South African officerprovisionally designated to succeed the Electrical Engineer-in-Charge will besent to the United Kingdom for the acquisition of the requisite knowledge and experience.   On his return to Simonstown he will understudy the UnitedKingdom-based Electrical Engineer-in-Charge for a short period beforerelieving him.3.     In the Chargeman, Inspector, Draughtsman, Foreman, and LeadingDraughtsman grades, it is expected that the periods of the change over from united Kingdom to South African personnel will necessarily be substantial.4.     Details of the replacement of United Kingdom personnel by South Africanpersonnel will have to be worked out in the light of experience, beaxdng inmind the, principle agreed by both Governments that the efficiency of the base must be maintained.3*     Conversely, it might be necessary, in order to meet the needs of theexpansion programme for the South African Navy, to secure for a timeadditional United Kingdom personnel for the Dockyard if the Admiralty arein a position to provide them.jfNote for information of Ministers :-The preyioua xiraft of Annex A included in paragraph 2 suggestions that18 months should be the period of understudy for the Captain Superintendentand the Chief Engineer and that 3 years should be the period of study in theUnited Kingdom for the Electrical Engineer-in-Charge designate; and inparagraph 3 that the periods of change over for the skilled grades namedmight well be of the following order:-; Chargemen 3 to 7 yearsInspectors and Draughtsmen 10 yearsForemen and Leading Draughtsmen      13 years/it was
SECRET-2-It was agreed at official level that these figures should he omitted from the Annex, hut that there should he a private exchange of correspondencedealing with these and a few related points.J7
ANNEX BConditions of Service for Admiralty Employees on LoanIn order to obtain volunteers for service on loan with the SouthAfrican Government the conditions of service offered will need to includethe following(1)   Salary or wages not less than those attaching to corresponding duties in the United Kingdom, plus a foreign service allowance adequate to match the higher standard of living and higher costs in South Afrioa.The methods of calculating this allowance adopted by Departments in theUnited Kingdom will probably be suitable.   In any case the remunerationoffered should not fall below that of a European locally enteredemployee of the corresponding grade.(2)   Free outward and return passages for volunteers and their families, andfor their effects (including furniture) in accordance with the scaleslaid down by the Admiralty.(3)   Payment of all certified removal expenses in connection with leaving and return to the United Kingdom in accordance with Admiralty practice,including liability for unexpired leases and rental agreements up toa maximum of six months.(4)   Return passages and related expenses to be guaranteed except for volunteers who fail to complete the period of loan for reasons within their own control, or who are found guilty of gross misconduct.(5)   Suitable single or married accommodation, as the case may be, to beavailable immediately or very shortly after arrival.   For thispurpose the South African Navy authorities will need for several years to oome to retain for the use of United Kingdom personnel most of the accommodation at present provided by the Admiralty for its UnitedKingdom staff and their families.(6)   Provision to ensure that the period of loan counts under the UnitedKingdom Superannuation Acts.(7)   Free medical, dental, and optical treatment for volunteers and their families in South Africa.   Alternatively the foreign serviceallowance should contain an element to allow for payment of medicalexpenses.(8)   If desired by the parent, free education of appropriate standards for children in schools maintained by South African public authorities.Special provision will need to be made for ohildren between the ages of 5 and 7 years.(9)   Contribution in accordance with Admiralty practice towards school fees and maintenance expenses of children who for educational or other reasons have to remain in the United Kingdom.(10) Loan to be for a fixed period determined beforehand, and personnelconcerned to have the right to return, if so desired, immediately on completion.
Sr&amp;RET-2-(11)   Loan to be to a specified place of duty, and no man on loan to beexpected to serve at any other place in a permanent or quasipermanentcapacity except as volunteers and on payment of all extra expensesinvolved.   Failure to volunteer for extended service elsewhere thanat the place of duty initially specified not to be regarded as a breach of contract.   Men on loan will, however, be expected ifnecessary to spend short periods at other places in the normal courseof their duties.(12)   Overseas family allowances to be paid in accordance with the presentAdmiralty practice.(13)   Civilians on loan to be entitled to the same freedom of organisation for the protection and representation of their interests and the samefacilities for joint consultation with the management as are enjoyedat present by United Kingdom-based staff and agreement workmen.(14)   Men on loan will not be required to learn Afrikaans.(15)   In order to ensure the goodwill of the Staff Associations and TradeUnions representing the Admiralty employees from whom volunteerswill be recruited, the proposed conditions will be discussed withthese organisations before they are promulgated.(16)   The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any Royal Navy personnellent for service in the base under the Union Government.
11.ANNEX CLocally-entered PersonnelLocally-entered personnel in service at the time of transfer will be En general the existing locally-entered personnel should all be/- retained in employment on transfer of the base, subject to the safeguards discussed in paragraph 2 below.   Exceptional cases may, however, arise when an existingSouth African organisation can take over, with little or no increase of staffwork at present performed by Admiralty employees.     It is recognised that insuch cases the Union public service might be quite unable to absorb all theAdmiralty employees rendered redundant in the base.    This might occur, forexample, with motor transport drivers in the Naval Store Department.    Con-ditions governing termination of employment in such cases will be worked outin detail.2.     It is agreed as a general principle that the prospects of the locally-entered staff in Admiralty service at the time should be fully preserved.This applies to both non-industrial and industrial grades.   To give effectto this principle it is agreed that when control of the base in handed tothe South African Navy the following provisions will be applied by the UnionGovernment(i)   No employee in service at the date of transfer will be dischargedexcept for serious misconduct, inefficiency or redundancy.    the disciplinary procedure will provide the employee with the sameopportunity to state his case as he has under Admiralty DookyardRegulations.      In the event of redundancy the order of dischargewill follow the principles in force under the Admiralty.In particular no employee in service at the date of transfer willbe discharged on the ground of unwillingness or inability to reach any particular degree of proficiency in either of the two officiallanguages of the Union.   Equally, no employee over the age of 50will be denied promotion on that ground:   younger men will beallowed a term of not less than three years to acquire any languagequalification laid down by the Union Government for promotion.The wages or salaries and cost of living allowance paid toemployees transferred to Union employment will initially be notless than those in force at the date of transfer, except for any individual downgraded for disciplinary reasons.    Thereafter theywill continue to be related to the practice of good employers inthe area.(iv)   No discrimination in rates of wages or conditions of service basedon race or colour will be applied to employees taken over by theUnion Government unless it is already operating at the date of transfer.(v)   Established employees will be guaranteed continuity of employment to the normal retiring age for their grade, subject only to theright of the Union authorities to discharge any individual for serious misconduct or a decline in efficiency so marked as to make him unfit to perform the duties of his grade or any lower gradefor which he may be qualified.(iii)^
I 2./ANKEX D(vi)   Arrangements will be made to preserve the superannuation rightsaccrued by established employees under the United KingdomSuperannuation Acts and to give superannuation benefits under theUnion regulations in respect of established service rendered afterthe date of transfer.    If possible, established employees alreadyentitled to benefits under the United Kingdom scheme for widows&apos;and dependants&apos; pensions will be afforded similar protection infuture.(vii)   The Union Government undertake to provide in the future opportunities of entry into their &quot;fixed establishment&quot; at least equal to thoseprospects of establishment accorded by the Admiralty at present;and there will be no discrimination in this respect betweenEuropeans and non-Europeans,(viii)   The Union Government give an assurance that unestablished employeesretained on transfer of the base will receive gratuities on abasis not less favourable than they could have expected if theAdmiralty had continued to administer the base;   arrangements to implement this principle will be worked out by experts of the twoGovernments.    The Union Government will also do their best toensure equitable treatment in the matter of gratuities for /Treatequitably in the matter of gratuitiesT&quot; any employees who areredundant as a result of the transfer.(ix)   The opportunities at present afforded to the locally-enteredemployees for making representations to the management will becontinued.(x)   Before the transfer of the base occurs representatives of the twoGovernments will discuss these issues with the ifechanics UnionsJoint Executive and the representatives of the locally-enterednon- industrial staff.   Account will be taken of any proposals madeby them for additional safeguards without any undertaking to adoptall or any of such proposals.
\ 2^ANNEX DExpansion of the Base facilities in order to ensure the fulfilment of this Agreement, taking intoaccount the expansion of the South African Navy referred to in the agreement on defence of sea routes round Southern Africa, the Union Government agreeto take the following measures required to expand the facilities of the base:-(a) in peace to make available alongside berths and full normalfacilities for two frigates of the Royal Navy as required,(for provisions governing war time, see paragraphs 2, 3, and 4in the main body of this Agreement).(b) to develop, by the time that the expansion programme of theSouth African Navy is completed, alongside berthing facilities inthe cambers on either side of the New jetty at the inner end of theeastern arm of the harbour,(c) to acquire at least two small tugs.(d) to work out, and execute to the fullest possible extent, a plan to increase the labour force of the dockyard as required by theexpansion of the South African Navy and the continuing needs ofthe Royal Navy.(e) to provide at Simonstown:-(i)   storage space and office accommodation, as agreed betweenthe two Governments, for stores peculiar to the Royal navy and for a small liaison staff.(ii)   explosive storage for about 500 tons of ammunition for R.N.vessels.(f) to make available living accommodation at the Klaver &quot;\V/T Station,\   or some other suitable location to be agreed, for the ships1companies of ships of the Royal Navy undergoing refit.(g) to ensure that none of the existing Admiralty plant, machinery,and equipment of the base taken over on transfer will be disposedof except by agreement between the Admiralty and the SouthAfrican Navy, and that all, together with works and buildings,will be properly maintained.

SECH E TAgreement on Defence of Sea Routesround Southern africa.     Recognising the importance of sea communications to the well-being of their respective countries in peace and to their common security inthe event of aggression /war/&quot;, the Governments of the Union of SouthAfrica and of the United Kingdom enter into the following Agreement toensure the safety, by the joint operations of their respective maritimeforces, of the sea routes round Southern Africa.2.     The Union Government have approved a programme for the expansion ofthe South African Navy.   The programme will be spread over a period of eight years from 1955 to 1963, and will involve the purchase of the followingvessels, which will be added to the existing fleet:-3. The Union Government will place firm orders in the United Kingdom forthe purchase of these vessels, costing some  18M. The Admiralty agree toact as agents for the Union Government in this matter.4.    After the control and administration of the Simonstown Naval Base arehanded over to the Union Government in accordance with the provisions ofthe /accompanying - deleted throughout both Agreements?&quot; Agreement, the royal naval Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic, will continue to fly the flag towhich he is entitled by R.N. regulations in the Cape area outside Simonstownand to exercise command over any Royal Naval units in the Union.5.     He will also be designated for purposes of planning and operationalcommand in war as Commander-in-Chief of a maritime strategic zone, whoseboundaries will approximate to those of the Royal Naval South AtlanticStation, and will include the Mozambique Channel.   It will, however, excludewaters further north which fall within the responsibility of the Royal naval commander-in-Chief, East Indies.    These boundaries will be subject toadjustment by agreement in the light of changing strategic considerations.6.     Thex Union Government wish to call the whole strategic zone the &quot;SouthernAfrican Strategic Zone&quot;, while the United Kingdom Government wish to retain the title &quot;South Atlantic&quot;.     It is agreed that the title of the zone willbe decided later, when this Agreement comes into force.7.     The strategic zone will include an area to be known as the &quot;SouthAfrican Area&quot;, which will be bounded by the coast of South Africa and a linedrawn from the northern boundary of South-West Africa through positions:-to Cap Sainte Marie (Madagascar), and thence to the boundary between UnionTerritory and Portuguese East Africa.   These boundaries will be subject to modification by agreement in the light of changing strategic considerations.The Union Government will appoint the Flag Officer commanding the SouthAfrican area.3 A/S Frigates, Type 123 A/S Frigates, Type 1510 Coastal Minesweepers4 Seaward Defence BoatslatitudeLongitude20oS50oS50oS30oS
SEC RE T8.     As agreed between the two Governments, forces will be earmarked in peacetime for assignment to the Commander-in-Chief and assigned to him in timeof war as defined in Annex A or emergency likely to lead to such a war.9.     In peacetime the Commander-in-Chief will be directly responsible onlyto the United Kingdom Government- and will have no executive authority overSouth African forces, establishments, or services.   He will, however, have as one of his primary functions the guiding of maritime war planning inthe strategic zone, and will be free to confer on these matters, in con-sultation with the South African Naval Chief of Staff, with the UnionMinister of Defence.   A more detailed description of the position and methodof working of the Commander-in-Chief as the designated supreme naval commander in war, based on N.A. T. 0. practice, is attached as Annex A.10.   A joint maritime war planning committee will be set up, containingrepresentatives of both navies, one of whose functions will be to co-coordinate the use of all maritime facilities in British and South African territories in the strategic zone, /&quot;&quot;added/&quot;11,   In a war in which both the United Kingdom and the Union are involved the Commander-in-Chief will be granted operational command as defined in annex A of all forces assigned to his strategic zone.12.   Since on the transfer of the control of the Simonstown Naval Base inaccordance with the provisions of the Agreement relating to that subject,Admiralty House and the adjacent offices and residences will be handed overto the South African Navy, the Union Government will in agreement with theUnited Kingdom Government provide headquarters in the Cape area, but outsideSimonstown, with requisite communications and operational facilities, for use by the Commander-in-Chief in peace and war.    These headquarters could con-veniently be at Toungsfield, or at Wingfield or any other suitable place inthe Cape area at which the Union Government might decide to establish theirmaritime headquarters.   The Union Government will also provide to the satisfaction of the Admiralty suitable residences for the Commander-in-chief and nine staff officers in an appropriate district outside Simonstown, and asclose as practicable to the headquarters, together with accommodation for single ratings and (on repayment by the U.K.) for married ratings displacedfrom the Simonstown area as a result of the Agreement on the SimonstownNaval Base.13.   The\command and control of the Ti^T installations known as Slangkop,Klaver, and Cape East will be regulated in accordance with the provisionsof the Agreement relating to the transfer of the control and administrationof the Simonstown Naval Base.14.   It is agreed in principle that exchanges of officers and ratingsbetoveen the two navies would be of advantage to both navies and should takeplace whenever practicable.   Such exchanges will be effected by mutual agreement between the two Governments.15.   It is agreed that the South African Navy will introduce a definiteprogramme for the recruitment, as well as the subsequent training in theUnited Kingdom, of Engineering and Electrical Officers in accordance with existing practice.16.   The arrangement outlined in this Agreement will not preclude theassociation of other Governments with the defence of the strategic zone,/should
should all the Governments concerned so agree.   In that event the UnionGovernment would support the United Kingdom Government in the designation ofthe Royal Naval Commander-in-Chief, South- Atlantic, as Commander-in-Chiefof the zone.17.

APPEND IX 0DRAFT MEMORANDUM OP AGREEMENT ON THE NEED for international DISCUSSIONS WITH REGARD TO THEDEFENCE OF SOUTHERN africa.      Southern Africa must &quot;be secured against aggression fromwithout.2.      The internal security of the countries of Southern Africamust,  however, remain a matter for each individual country concerned.3.     As the defence of Southern Africa against external aggression lies not only in Africa but also in the gateways toAfrica, namely in the Middle East, it is the declared policy -(a) of the United Kingdom not only to contribute forces for the defence of Southern Africa and Africa, butalso for the Middle East;(b) of the Union Government to contribute forces in orderto keep the potential enemy as far as possible fromthe borders of South Africa, in other words for thedefence of Southern Africa, Africa and the middle east gateways to Africa.    While the Union&apos;s contribu-tion will depend upon satisfactory arrangements beingarrived at between the countries mainly concerned asto the nature and extent of the contribution which each will make, the Union Government is in the mean-time building up a task force for use outside SouthAfrica against external aggression.h.      In order to implement the above policies, the lines ofcommunication and logistic support in and around Southern Africamust he adequate and securely defended.5.      In this connection the arrangements set out in a separate agreement for the defence of the sea route round Southern Africaare of primary importance.6.      The adequacy and security of logistic facilities and communications within Southern Africa, and particularly along the lines of communication to the Middle East are matters whichshould be further considered,7.     To this end it is agreed that the United Kingdom and SouthAfrica will jointly sponsor a conference to integrate forward and develop the planning already begun at the Nairobi Conference.8.

APPENDIX DDRAFT COMMUNICATION TOMR. SBLWYN LLOYD BY MR. ERASMUSIt is clear that the conclusion of the Agreements whichhave now been signed by us, providing for co-operation between theUnion of South Africa and the United Kingdom in matters relating tothe security of Africa, require as a logical consequence an effectiveform of consultation between our respective Service Staffs on all relevant questions.This essential aim can most effectively be reached by thedevelopment of the existing procedures for exchanging information ina manner which would ensure the frankest form of collaboration on matters falling within the purview of the Agreements.While the Union&apos;s participation in the Middle East would depend on the formal arrangements arrived at after negotiations betweenthe Governments primarily interested, I would be happy to authorise theSouth African Service Staffs to include, in their discussions with yourService Staffs, matters relating to South Africa&apos;s participation in thedefence of that area.    This would of course have to be on a provisionalbasis and without commitment.I should be glad to learn whether the suggestions containedin this letter meet with your concurrence.
