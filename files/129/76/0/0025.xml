PALESTINE settlement memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs when I saw Mr. Dulles, the United States Secretary of State, inSan Francisco he told me that he had reached the conclusion that he wouldhave shortly to make a statement of United States policy on Palestine.    Hehad been under heavy pressure from the Israelis for several months tooffer them a treaty of guarantee and had so far succeeded in putting themoff with the assurance that he was working seriously on the problem and hoped to arrive at conclusions which would satisfy their need for securityeHe did not believe that it would be possible to hold this position much longer.    With every month that passed, the danger of the Palestine questionbecoming an issue in the United States election campaign increased,    S&amp;   ,the meantime our efforts to induce the Prime Minister of Egypt to enterinto discussion of a possible settlement had not achieved results and there seemed little prospect, in view of deteriorating conditions in Gaza, of anyprogress along these lines in the near future.      He therefore thought thatthe time had come to make a public statement of the outlines of the Alphaplan (the Anglo-American plan referred to in C.P.(55) 35) which had been worked out between our two Governments.    Mr. Dulles said he hoped thatI would be prepared to make a similar statement at the same time.2 . I told Mr. Dulles that I understood his difficulties and would consider his proposal sympathetically.    Since then I have learned moreabout his intentions from his representative, Mr. Russell, who is now inLondon.    The position in brief is that the longer Mr. Dulles waits themore difficult it will be for him to make a balanced statement on thesubject of Palestine.  As lite elections approach so the pressure for astatement favourable to Israel will increase.    By making a statement onthe basis of the agreed Alpha plan he would crystallise United states policy on that basis and enable the Administration to hold firmly to thispolicy throughout the election period.    He believes that he might even beable to persuade certain Democratic leaders to come out in support ofsuch a statement and so remove the Palestine issue from the election campaign.    He wishes to make his statement as soon as possible afterthe Israeli elections and suggests about 18th August.    The draft of his statement has been discussed with the Foreign Office, and I attach a copyof the essential passages.    As will be seen it faithfully reflects the mainoutlines of the Alpha proposals with which my colleagues are alreadyfamiliar.3. Mr, Dulles wishes to discuss this with me in Paris on Thursdayand I propose, if my colleagues see no objection, to inform him that subjectto certain conditions set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 I agree in principle toThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No...S.ft;C.P.(55) 7513th july 1955CABINET
support him .in the statement he makes and to offer the co-operation of theUnited Kingdom in the effort for a settlement within the limits already-approved by the Cabinet (C. M. (55)15th  Conclusions, Minute 6).4. I have to draw attention, however, to the risks which this procedure entails.    The statement will be highly unpalatable to the israeli government because it will destroy their hopes (now apparently runninghigh) of securing a guarantee from the United States in advance- of any settlement and without sacrifice on their part.    It is conceivable that anew and &quot;tough&quot; Israeli Government, emerging from the elections, might be tempted to desperate action by a disappointment of this kind.    I do not ratethis danger very high and it must be recalled that Israel is in effect atthe mercy of the United States if the latter should wish to put pressure on her.5.        The greater  dangers lie in the reaction of the Arab world.    Theproposed statement might be taken simply as a further attempt to put pressure on the Arabs to make peace with Israel against their will, andthere might be a considerable outburst of feeling.    This might take various forms.    The refugees might get out of hand in the camps in Gaza and Jordan,,There might be demonstrations against British and American persons and property in Arab States, leading to incidents in which the Arab Legion orthe British forces in Iraq, Jordan or Libya might become involved.    more serious, perhaps, the reaction of the Arab world might be such as to throwaway the progress we have made over the Northern Tier defence and evenendanger our treaty with Iraq.    There might be a new outburst of criticism of Nuri for co-operating with the Western Powers.6,        These dangers, and the particular impact which they might have on British interests and responsibilities in the Middle East, have been strongly emphasised to the Americans.    I have insisted particularly on theimportance of the Iraqi reaction and have told them that my reply toMr. Dulles will depend to a large extent on the advice I receive from. M. Ambassador in Bagdad to whom I am sending out a member of theForeign Office by air to explain the position fully,7.     In this connection it has become apparent that there are certainways in which we could reasonably expect the Americans, in return for our support, to help us over our Middle East policies generally and in particularover Iraq.    These are as follows:-(i)    As my colleagues are aware, the impetus towards area defencecreated by the signature of the Turco/traqi Pact and our accession theretohas been considerably slowed down in recent weeks by the evident factthat the United States was unwilling to join it herself and was even tending to discourage other Arab States, neighbours of Israel, from joining.    Ithas now been suggested informally on the American side that they mightbe willing to tell Nuri that if a settlement on the lines of Alpha could bereached the United States would be prepared to join the Pact,    This wouldgive important additional impulse to the whole Middle East defence system,and I would propose to try to extract definite assurances in &quot;this sense fromMr, Dulles.(ii)     I have also let it be known to the United States Government thatin return for our support in this matter they should take a decision to supplyIraq with British Centurion tanks by off-shore purchase and that Nuri should
be informed of this decision before the proposed settlement is made.This, as my colleagues know, is an objective of the first importance forthe proper development of Iraq&apos;s armed forces on British lines and wouldbe of very great value to Iraq and to Middle East defence generally.    Here,too, I would propose to press Mr. Dulles very strongly.(iii)     Since we are in effect being exposed to possible embarrassmentsand dangers in the Middle East on account of American internal politics,I think we should ask the Americans to consider what physical supportthey would be ready to give us in the event of our becoming involved in fighting as a direct result of the statements or, indirectly, through theoperation of the Anglo/Jordan Treaty and the Tripartite Declaration.I have in mind the possible need to make naval and other dispositions asa precautionary measure.8.        There appear to me to be three courses open to us.    First, wecan support Mr. Dulles1 statement and, by a similar statement from our side, fully share responsibility for the action and for the proposed settle-ment.    In that event we should seek to obtain the price described inparagraph 7 above.    Secondly, we could endeavour to dissuade Mr, Dullesfrom making his statement.    This, I believe, would be extremelydifficult in view of his judgment of his own political position.    Moreover,it would, I fear, lead us to a situation later on in which the United states would be forced to a policy more favourable to Israel, from which we might be compelled to dissociate ourselves openly in order to protectour interests in the Arab world.    Thirdly, we could let Mr, Dulles make his statement but endeavour to dissociate ourselves to some extent fromthe responsibility for the timing of it which admittedly is not a timingwhich we should have chosen,    I do not believe that this would do usmuch good,    We could not avoid admitting that we had been consultedor, indeed, that we had taken part in the elaboration of the plan which heoutlines.    We should have to declare that we were in favour of hisapproach.    I do not believe that the Arab world would understand thefine distinction between approving of what he said and having doubts about his timing.    I fear that we should get just as much obloquy, whilegiving to the Americans and to those Middle East leaders who took thepointy a disagreeable impression of lagging behind the Americans whichwould not be consonant with our position of responsibility in the middle east.9.        In short, I believe that we should agree to support this projectfully and from the beginning.    But I should ask for American agreement to our proposals to reduce the risk and soften the blow.    Fundamentally,the proposals represent a courageous and, I think, right attempt to break the deadlock between Israel and the Arab States.    The Palestinesituation is steadily deteriorating and no prospect shows of achieving a real easement by the methods of secret diplomacy which we have hithertohoped to employ.    The plan of settlement proposed is a fair one; it involves concessions by both sides and it can be shown to be in the realinterests of both sides.    Many people, even some Arabs, have admittedprivately that the issue will never be resolved until the Western Powerstake a hand and state what they think should be done.    In the long run,when the dust has settled, there is a good chance that responsible leaderson both sides will come to see the advantage of the proposals.    in framing the statements and in our subsequent comment we shall be
z*gzcareful not to suggest that we want any immediate answer or any acceptanceof early talks, mediation, etc.    We shall take the line that we have said oursay, that we hope all concerned will give it careful thought before committing themselves and that all we are asking is that, if they feel any interest in it,they should seek further elucidation from us.    The outline of the plan, as my colleagues will see, is in general terms and there is a great deal left for subsequent negotiation.    It would be our purpose, after administering the jolt of public statements, to draw the interested parties back into theprocess of secret, &quot;Trieste-type&quot; negotiation from which eventual agree-ment might be achieved.H. M.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.12th July, 1955.EXTRACTS FROM DRAFT OF POSSIBLEPUBLIC STATEMENT BY MR. DULLES ON ANISRAEL-ARAB settlement the Arab-Israel ProblemWhat are the principal remaining problems ?    There are threethat stand out above the others.The first is the tragic plight of the 900,000 refugees who formerlylived in the territory that is now occupied by Israel.\    The second is the pall of fear that hangs over the Arab and Israelpeople alike.    The Arab countries fear that Israel will seek by violentmeans to expand at their expense.    The Israelis fear that the Arabs will gradually marshall superior forces to be used to drive them into the sea.The third is the lack of fixed permanent boundaries between israel and its Arab neighbours.There are other important problems.    But if these threeprincipal problems could be dealt with, then the way would be paved forthe solution of others.It seems to me that these three problems are capable ofsolution and surely there is need.Border clashes take an almost weekly toll of human lives.    the sufferings of the 900,000 Arab refugees are drawn out almost beyond thepoint of endurance.    The fears which are at work, on each side, lead toa heavy burden of armament, which constitutes a serious drag on economic
and social progress.    Responsible leaders are finding it hard to turn their full attention and energies to the positive task of creating the conditions of stability and healthy growth out of which strong nations could emerge.Serious as the present situation is, there is a danger that unless it improves it will get worse.    One ill leads to another, and cause and effect are hard to sort out.    Both sides suffer greatly from the presentsituation, and both are anxious for what they would regard as a just and equitable solution.    But neither has been able to find that way.    This maybe a situation where mutual friends could, through their good offices, serve the common good.The United States, as a friend of both Israelis and Arabs, has given the situation deep thought and has come to certain conclusions, theexpression of which may help men of good will within the area to freshconstructive efforts.    I speak in this matter with the authority of thePresident.     x know that the British Government, with whom we havebeen in consultation, have reached similar conclusions^/I.We find no single and easy answer to the plight of the 900,000 Arabrefugees who formerly lived in the territory that is now Israel, who fledat the time of the fighting in 1948 and were barred from returning to their homes and the cost of whose maintenance now falls directly on the inter-national community.    But we do feel that an answer can be found in a combination of measures which, together, would re-establish these uprootedpeople and offer them hope of a new life.Compensation by the State of Israel is due for the land and buildings belonging to the refugees which are now in Israel&apos;s possession.Perhaps Israel cannot, unaided, now make adequate compensation.    if so, there might be an international loan to Israel of the balance of the sumnecessary.    The President would recommend substantial participationby the United States in such a loan for such a purpose.\The money must be used to create more arable land on which the refugees could make permanent homes and work to produce a self-respecting livelihood.    Money alone, however, will not solve the problem.It is no longer possible for Israel to take back all or most of the refugees.But she might reasonably be asked to find homes for a limited number ofthose who might choose to return.    Large numbers, however, will necessarily remain.    Many of these could be settled over a period ofthe next few years as a result of projects such as the Jordan ValleyDevelopment Plan, the Sinai Project, and as a result of the increasedopportunities provided by the expanding economies of countries of the area,Here, too, outside help might be required.II.The second principal element which I mentioned is that of fear.The nature of this fear is such that it is not within the capacity of any single country of the area to take measures to dispel it.President Eisenhower has authorised me to say that,if a solution can befound to the other related problems, he would recommend that the United
States enter into formal engagements with the countries concerned to take appropriate action to prevent or thwart any effort by either side to alterby force the boundaries between Israel and its Arab neighbours,    I hopethat other countries would be willing to join in such a guarantee, and itmight perhaps be sponsored by the United Nations,III.If there is to be a guarantee of borders, it would be normal thatthere should be a prior agreement upon what the borders are.    That is thethird major element.    The existing lines separating the Arab States fromIsrael were fixed by the Armistice Agreements of1949.    They reflected the status of the fighting at the moment.    They were not&quot; designed to be permanent frontiers in every respect.    They clearly require rectification-tions and adjustments.For example, there should presumably be an allocation of thepresent demilitarized zones and &quot;no man&apos;s lands&quot; created by theArmistice Agreements,It would seem desirable to restore to Arab border villages atleast some portion of the immediately adjoining farm lands upon which thevillagers must depend for their livelihood and from which they are nowcut off by the Armistice Line.Also, adjustments might give Israel the use of the normal road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The Arab world, which is now separated by Israel possession ofthe Negev, understandably desires an unbroken land connection.    this could be provided, without prejudice to any of Israels vital interests,by ceding to one or two Arab nations sovereignty over triangular portions of the Negev having little or no economic value and now wholly barren.The Arab triangles could be based on the Egyptian and Jordanian frontiersrespectively so that their apexes meet at a point on an Israeli route to thesouth, where a suitable overpass could be arranged.    Thus the nowdivided Arabs would re-establish sovereign contact, while the sovereignconnection of Israel with the port of Elath would be maintained.IV.If agreement can be reached on these basic elements - refugees,boundaries and the elimination of fear - it should prove possible to findsolutions for other questions, largely economic, and to bring to an endexternal economic measures, such as blockade, which presently  an theflames of hostility and resentment.It should also be possible to reach agreement on the status of jerusalem.    The United States would give its support to a United Nationsreview of this problem.
