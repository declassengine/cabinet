CJP,(55) 8019th July, 1955CABINETENSIGNS INCREASIMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerIntroductionI warned my colleagues in March that at some stage theGovernment would have to consider the introduction of a pensions increase Bill to improve the pensions of retired members of thepublic services generally, both civil and military - that is, the Forces,civil servants, teachers, police, firemen, etc.   (C.C.(55) 27thConclusions, Minute 5).2,     Since then the internal position has made further economydesirable0    But the pressure for further relief has continued to growand the public pronouncements of the Government have been increasingly-conciliatory.    For instance on 4th May, it was stated in parliament that:-&quot;We mean to keep the position of these pensionersunder review sympathetically and understandingly andif a further Measure is warranted we shall certainlyintroduce it.    The present law on the subject is not like the law of the Medes and Persians which cannotbe altered. &quot;The Pensions (Increase) Act of 1952, though the best we could affordat the time, was not a very generous measure J there is a case for doing more;  and we should at least consider our policy again.30     At any rate, I consider that we ought to be ready by the timeParliament reassembles after the summer recess with a new schemeof pensions increase which could be introduced at a moment&apos;s noticeas and when necessary.    On my instructions a good deal of preliminary-spade work has been done in the Treasury, but no further progress canbe made without my colleagues&apos; general agreement on the basic principles which should govern the preparation of any such scheme in.detail.Pensions Increase Philosophy4C      The basis of the existing Pensions (Increase) Acts passed by successive Governments has been that public service pensions onceawarded are not normally varied thereafter, but that where there havebeen severe falls in money values special increases may be justifiedto relieve real hardship among pensioners with small total means,The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No. &amp; 4
In practice this has mean-; that under the existing Acts no pensionerswith a total income above  650 (except certain former civil servants and Forces officers affected by stabilisation and consolidation in1932-35 who are eligible for a special increase of 10 per cent with no limit on size of pension) can get any increase at all,5.      I am sure we must stick firmly to the basic philosophy.    ButI think that the time has come to take a more lenient view of what ishardship.    In particular I suggest that it is reasonable to accept that, if a man!s pension is drastically reduced by inflation of the sortwhich has occurred since 1939a then he deserves some compensation,whatever the size of his pension - though doubtless the compensationgiven to larger pensions should be proportionately less than that givento smaller ones.    I think too that the time has come to recognise thatthe compensation should be given irrespective of what the pensioner !sother means may be,     This seems to rr:..-c to be defensible in principleonce one gets away from the test of severe hardship as interpretedhitherto; and, in any event, if there is no limit to the size of the pension eligible for assistance then it is impracticable to have an&quot;other income&quot; test.    It also follows that the distinction hithertodrawn between pensioners with dependents and pensioners without shouldbe dropped.    In short, what we should look at is the pension and notthe pensioners other circumstances,6.      This would amount to a substantial modification of the attitudeunderlying the provisions of the existing Acts and defended on numerousoccasions by successive Governments.    I think we are unlikely,however, to meet much criticism on this score.Outline of a Possible New Scheme7.      My preliminary view of the way in which we might put this new approach into effect is, very generally, as follows(i)  On the civil side further increases should be given to pensioners whose pensions were awarded before, say,April 1952 - except that some earlier date should be operative for fee-highest pensions^ perhaps those of dcMwq f*o**civilian(V\** 0^scuj l,500 and above.    On the Forces side date of award ofpension has not the same significance as it has on thecivil side, but mutatis mutandis corresponding increase should be given to members of the Armed Forces retiringunder past Codes;  and almost certainly to most at anyrate of those retiring under the present (1950) Code.(ii)  This further increase should be one of up to 10 per cent of the basic pension, subject to a maximum of  100.This, of course, would be over and above anythingreceived under the existing Acts.(iii)  These increases should be payable, without regard to apensioner^ private means, on all pensions irrespective of size, and irrespective of whether the pensioner hasdependants or not.(iv) The means tests in the existing Acts should be removed and so should the limits on the size of pension which atpresent qualify under them.    This could mean   the paymentof up to  86 in addition to the  100 at (ii) above in the caseof the larger pensions.
8.     The total cost of a scheme of this sort might be about 10 millions a year to start with, decreasing as time goes on.    About75 per cent of this would be a charge to the Exchequer, the rest tothe rates*Some Comments9,     (i)      There may well be criticism on the score that inabsolute money terms a good deal more will begiven to those with large pensions/incomes than to those with small pensions/incomes.    the answer to this criticism is that the larger pensions/incomes have had little or nothing before, whereas -the small pensions have already had substantial increases.    In any case, even with increases ofthe order mentioned above the large pensions would still be getting relatively less generous treatmentthan the small ones.    For example, the total increase on a local government pension of  150which started in 1939 would be  86 i, e, 57 per cent,whereas for a corresponding pension of  1,200 itwould be  186 i, e, only 15, 5 per cent,(ii) The scheme outlined above makes no claim, any morethan do the existing Acts, (a) to bring existingpensions up to the level of current pensions, still less (b) to restore the original purchasing power infull.    We must stick to this though it means that thepensioners1 associations will not be satisfied:   (a)would be unworkable and (b) indefensible- since itwould produce results incompatible with the levelof pensions awarded to those retiring currently.In any case both would be too costly,(iii) It will not satisfy the Forces officers retired underthe 1919 Code who regard themselves as entitledto a further increase of 20 per cent and who assertthat there is a breach of faith until they get it.But this is a rather special problem and it isdifficult to envisage any approach which would atonce satisfy this group and yet be such as we couldmanage and as would be fair to all.Timing10, We shall have to consider whether to introduce a newmeasure in the autumn.    Certainly on the civil side the longer we waitthe more we may have to concede and the greater the chance of reper&quot;cussions.    But the matter will have to be carefully considered especiallyin relation to the Forces, many Forces pensioners having already had their pensions brought up to the levels prevailing under the current Code0Conclusion11. I ask my colleagues approval of the preparation by theTreasury and the other Departments responsible for both civil andmilitary pensioners, of a scheme of pensions increase on the lines setout above which I will lay before them at the earliest possible moment forfurther consideration both of its content and of the timing of its introduction.Treasury Chambers, S,,W01.18th July, 1955,
