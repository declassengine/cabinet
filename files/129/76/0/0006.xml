THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1955SECRET Copy No. ^ iCP. (55) 561st July, 1955CABINETRETIREMENT OF VICE-ADMIRAL J. HUGHES HALLETTMemorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyLast September the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I recommended thatVice-Admiral J. Hughes Hallett, who had retired from the Royal Navy to becomeConservative candidate in the bye-election at East Croydon, should be awardedretired pay at the rate of  1,200 instead of the  873 to which he was entitled underthe regulations, on the ground that he had been wrongly advised by my then NavalSecretary about the conditions of his retirement. The full circumstances are set outin C. (54) 290.2. The Cabinet considered that it was undesirable and unnecessary to reach adecision at that time (C.C. (54) 61st Conclusions, Minute 5). It was undesirablebecause the award of retired pay outside the regulations to an officer who wasstanding as a candidate for the Government party might be misconstrued. It was unnecessary first because Admiral Hughes Hallett had been informed of his truerate of retired pay before he actually retired and yet he had continued with hiscandidature; and secondly because it was open to him to bring an action, when theGovernment could consider whether to contest his claim or, if his case were considered to be a strong one, to concede an additional payment.3. On 24th November the Admiralty received a letter from Messrs. CharlesRussell and Company, Admiral Hughes Halletfs solicitors, stating his intention of taking legal proceedings for damages if his claim to the higher rate of retired paycould not be met.4. At the Cabinet meeting the then Attorney-General had said that in hisopinion, although Admiral Hughes Hallett might have a strong moral claim, it was by no means certain that he. would succeed in law in satisfying the courts that hehad suffered damage. On the other hand although the Admiralty had made their original proposal to the Treasury on ethical grounds, I was aware that theChancellor had agreed to recommend my proposal to the Cabinet on the basis of preliminary legal advice that Admiral Hughes Hallett would probably succeed inthe courts. Before approaching the Cabinet again I therefore considered it essentialto seek a formal opinion from the Law Officers on the whole case. This is containedin the annex to this paper.5. The legal issues are obviously complicated. Much turns on the questionwhether there was a special relationship between my Naval Secretary and admiral Hughes Hallett such that a special duty of care was created. So far asit goes, the weight of legal precedent seems to indicate that there was not.Nevertheless Messrs. Charles Russell must be aware of that and they may have advised the Admiral to pursue the matter, if necessary, to the House of Lords, wherethe correctness of certain judgments, which might appear to be adverse to his claim, would be open to argument. There is, moreover, a danger that in any proceedings the Admiral might add a claim for the higher rate of retired pay andthat would raise legal issues which it is most desirable to avoid in a case where thereis so little merit on the Crown&apos;s side. In any case the Government and theAdmiralty would get little credit if the details of this case had to be discussed inthe Courts.48287
ANNEXVice-Admiral John Hughes HallettOpinion of the Law Officers of the Crown and Mr. Rodger Winn1. Our Instructions state that it is generally understood that officers ofFlag rank turn to the Naval Secretary for advice on the general conditions on whichthey may be employed and retired: that it is conceded that officers of Flag rankare entitled to look to the Naval Secretary for information as to their retired pay and to rely on the information they receive from him: and that it was part of theNaval Secretary&apos;s official duty to advise Flag Officers upon the conditions of theirretirement.6. The Law Officers may have had some such considerations in mind when,in making the following recommendation, they referred to &quot; the doubts which exist &quot;:  &apos;: In our opinion Vice-Admiral Hughes Halletfs claim should only beadmitted if it is clearly well founded. On the information in our possessionthat does not appear to be the case. In our view therefore his claim should be resisted, but, having regard to the doubts which exist, we recommend that theclaim should if possible be settled. If it is not settled, one possible solution would be an arbitration.&quot;7. I still think that the right course is to pay the higher rate of retired pay.There is no doubt whatever that the Admiral was wrongly informed by a highly-placed servant of the Admiralty. In their opinion the Law Officers say &quot; Itis difficult to appreciate what damage he would have suffered if he had refused togo before the [East Croydon Conservative] Association on the ground that theAdmiralty required his services.&quot; From a legal point of view the damage may beconsidered remote, but I think that from a political point of view it is clear enough.I do not agree with the implication that to withdraw from the election would havehad no effect on the AdmitaPs political career. From my knowledge of AdmiralHughes Hallett, I. am sure that he will take legal action if his claim is not met.Public opinion would be against us. I believe that we shall be forced in the end tomeet this claim in full and I think that we should do so with good grace now.8. If the Cabinet are not prepared to agree to this course but nevertheless donot consider they can reject the claim outright, the other suggestions of the LawOfficers fall to be considered.9. I do not think that the Crown could with dignity agree to arbitration insuch a matter.10. Negotiations with Messrs. Charles Russell would presumably be conducted by the Treasury Solicitor who would need to know within what limits,if any, he should work. In my view such negotiations are unlikely to be successfulunless a sum representing the greater part of the claim is conceded. (The treasury solicitor does not agree with this view and believes that there is a fair chance ofsuccess on a fifty-fifty basis.) The potential loss which the Admiral has suffered,based on a retired pay  327 a year less than he expected, commuted into a lump sumunder the standard commutation tables, is  3,933 16s. Od.11.   The Cabinet are asked to decide:  (a) whether Admiral Hughes Hallett should be granted retired pay at the rateof  1,200 a year, the award being noted in the Appropriation Account;(b) whether an attempt should be made to settle the claim on a compromisebasis, involving a lump sum payment; or(c) whether the claim should be rejected outright.J. P. L. T.Admiralty, S.W. I,29th June, 1955.
2. Assuming, as from our Instructions would appear to be the case, that theeffect of Admiral Onslow&apos;s statements to Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett was that hewould receive the full rate of retired pay despite his voluntary retirement, it doesnot necessarily follow that Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett has any legal rightsarising therefrom.3. It is in our view clear that Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett cannot sue for hisretired pay (Leaman v. R. 1920 3 K.B. 663: Mitchell v. R. (1896) 1 Q.B. 121) andin our view he cannot successfully rely upon the decision in Robertson v. Ministerof Pensions (1949) 1 K.B. 227 (see Combe v. Combe (1951) 2 K.B. 215).4. In our opinion Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett could only succeed in his claim against the Crown if he established that Admiral Onslow when making hisoral statements was under a special duty arising from a special relationship to himsuch as to render the Crown responsible in law for damage resulting from admiral Onslow&apos;s negligent advice.In Derry v. Peek (1889) 14 A.C. 337 Lord Herschell, at page 360, put on one sidethose cases where a person within whose special province it lay to know a particularfact has given an erroneous answer to an inquiry made with regard to it by a persondesirous of ascertaining the fact for the purpose of determining his course of action and has been held bound to make good the assurance he has given. In Nocton v.Ashburton (1914) A.C. 932 Lord Haldane observed that in Derry v. Peek their lordships &quot; must indeed be taken to have thought that the facts proved as to the relationship of the parties were not enough to establish any special duty arising outof that relationship other than the general duty of honesty.&quot; He said at page 948&quot; whether such a duty has been assumed must depend on the relationship of theparties &quot; and more than once he referred to the duty as a fiduciary obligation(see pages 946, 951, 952, 953, 955, 956), though without defining precisely what hemeant by that.5. In Candler v. Crane (1951) 2 K.B. 165 the Court of Appeal by a majorityheld that an accountant instructed to furnish information at the request of hisprincipals to a third party was not liable to that third party in damages, there being no fiduciary relationship between them.6. The first and most important question therefore is whether a special relationship of such a fiduciary nature existed in this case. The precise meaning of &quot; fiduciary &quot; in this context is still not clear, and on the information given to usit is not possible to give a positive answer. As Lord Haldane said at page 950&quot; such a special relationship must whenever it is alleged be clearly shown to exist.&quot;7. In our opinion it cannot therefore be said that the existence of such aspecial relationship is in the circumstances of this case clearly established. If itwas, a further question remains for consideration, namely whether Vice-AdmiralHughes Hallett had before he learnt the true position acted on the misrepresentationto an extent rendering it not reasonably practicable to withdraw from offeringhimself as a candidate.8. There is no doubt that Vice-Admiral Hughes Hallett acted on the assurances he received and he maintains that before he learnt the true positionhe had taken steps from which he could not withdraw without detriment to his political future. It is difficult to appreciate what damage he would have sufferedif he had refused to go before the Association for adoption on the ground that theAdmiralty required his services. He had at that time only been selected for adoption.9. In our opinion Vice Admiral Hughes Halletfs claim should only beadmitted if it is clearly well founded. On the information in our possession that does not appear to be the case. In our view therefore his claim should be resisted,but, having regard to the doubts which exist, we recommend that the claim should if possible be settled. If it is not settled, one possible solution would be an arbitration.(Signed)   REGINALD MANNINGHAM-BULLER.H. HYLTON FOSTER.RODGER WINN.Law Officers&apos; Department,7th April, 1955.
