Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1955SECRET Copy No. 6 5CP. (55) 8120th July, 1955CABINETFEDERATION OF MALAYA: CONSTITUTIONAL development memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the first elections to the Federal Legislative Council in Malaya will takeplace on 27th July and will result in a Council with a small majority of elected members.2. All the major political parties contesting the elections have already committed themselves to secure the establishment of some sort of Commissionto examine the constitution with a view to recommending a rapid advancementtowards self-government.3. It is certain that after the elections pressure for such an advance willmount rapidly and, unless the initiative is first taken by us, it will lead to extravagantand competitive claims by political leaders for early self-government, taking no account of the fact that the Federation of Malaya will for some time to comebe quite unable without outside help to defend itself against external aggression,to maintain internal security or even to balance its budget. It is therefore important to anticipate this development and to bring the leaders of political opinion in the Federation to face the need to make satisfactory arrangements toensure their survival against hostile forces before they proceed to the more congenialtask of discussing the next stage of development towards internal self-government.If we do not make the next move, others will, with really embarrassing consequences4. The constitution of the Federation of Malaya is embodied in an Agreementbetween Her Majesty and the Rulers of the Malay States. I suggest that the nextstep should therefore be to negotiate the substance of a new agreementincorporating satisfactory arrangements about certain fundamental points. Thenegotiations might take place between a team from the United Kingdomrepresenting Her Majesty as one of the principals and a team representing the rulers as the other principal. The leaders of political opinion in the Federationcould participate as advisers to the Rulers. The objects of the talks would not beto negotiate any new constitution, but to incorporate in a new agreement satisfactory arrangements to cover the following points, before there is any further discussionof advance towards internal self-government.(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Governments responsibilities for the defence of theFederation. It is clear that the Federal Government will not be able to provideor pay for the forces necessary to protect it, unaided, from external aggression formany years to come, if ever. We should, therefore, seek from the Rulers areiteration of their desire that we retain this responsibility; and to enable us to fulfilit when Malaya has become internally self-governing, the Rulers and their advisers should be asked to agree to provide the necessary facilities and to guarantee theseby incorporation in the new agreement. This part of negotiations would in effectresult in a form of agreement covering the establishment of United kingdom military bases in the Federation.(b) The maintenance of internal security in the Federation. The threat tothe internal security of the Federation arises partly from the physical features of48420
the country, partly from the plural nature of its society, but mainly from its close proximity to Communist China and its satellites, combined with the existence inthe Federation of a large Chinese population. This imposes an unusually gravesecurity threat which requires larger forces to meet than the federation government will be able to provide for some time to come. It will, therefore,be necessary for us to give some assistance, at least in the transitional period beforefull internal self-government: and it would be desirable to incorporate in the new agreement a clear and definite statement on the extent and manner of this assistance.(c) Reconsideration of the financial relationship between Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Federation. It is clearly incompatible with even internal self-government that we should continue virtually to underwrite the financialposition of the Federation generally and certain specific programmes, in particularthose for education and the replanting of rubber. It is necessary to reach somesettled formula on the extent of our financial assistance. The objective of suchan agreement should be to ensure that any assistance which has to be given duringthe period of transition towards self-government can be tapered off during thatperiod. Full self-government and financial dependence are not compatible andeven if it might eventually be necessary in the special circumstances of Malayato devise some means of assistance after full internal self-government has beengranted, no such suggestion will be made to Malayan leaders at this stage. It isalso necessary that there should be specific agreement in regard to any further financial assistance which may be necessary to finance development projects duringthe transition period. In the absence of such formulas and agreement it must beexpected that there would be irresponsibility by the Federal Government in financial matters.(d) The relationship of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom to the Federation. This would determine the status and functions of the HighCommissioner and his authority and responsibility in relation to such matters asdefence and external affairs.Opportunity might also be taken to seek agreement on two other issues inthe course of these talks.(e) A Malayan nationality. The present citizenship laws are unsatisfactoryin that they deny citizens&apos; rights to large sections of the Chinese community andthey stand in the way of the possibility of a satisfactory agreement with Chinaon the subject of dual nationality. They also tend to admit as subjects of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies persons whose loyalty to the Crown is doubtful.There might, therefore, be great advantage in the recognition of a special Malayannationality. This is a matter of such importance that it could properly be thesubject of negotiation between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Rulers at thehighest level.(/) The Composition and Terms of Reference of a Constitutional Commis-sion. If agreement were reached on the points enumerated at (a) to (e) above,then there would seem to be no good reason why proposals for further constitutional change, with a view to a further measure of self-government withina limited field, should not be worked out by a body consisting mainly of Malayans,with the addition of some expert advice about constitutional forms. In other words, the way should be clear for the appointment of a Commission to review the remaining points of the constitution as incorporated in the present agreement and to make recommendations which would then be likely to be acceptable tous without putting us in the embarrassing position of having to reject populardemands on the grounds of security and defence.5. The further constitutional change envisaged in the preceding paragraphcould properly embrace the question of the constitutional position of the Rulersin a democratic form of government based on universal suffrage a question that could only satisfactorily be solved by local discussion and agreement.6. It is very desirable that the idea of negotiating the framework for further constitutional change towards self-government should be put to the Rulers and accepted by them at an early date. To leave the matter until there is strong pressure for the early appointment of a Commission to consider these changes, or untilMalay nationalism has gathered further momentum or until the Emergency haspetered out and is no longer a present threat to the security of Malaya,might prejudice the satisfactory outcome of negotiations in regard to British bases
and the fundamental issues of responsibility for external and internal defence. i therefore propose to discuss this matter during my forthcoming visit to theFederation with the Conference of Rulers and the elected Ministers of the newFederal Government and to try to reach agreement with them in principle on theneed for such high-level talks.7.   I invite the agreement of my colleagues to the following propositions:  (a) that we should seek to secure a new agreement with the Rulers, with the safeguards for the future I have set out above, before discussing anyfurther advance towards internal self-government; and(b) that I should discuss this proposal with the Rulers and with leaders ofpolitical opinion in the Federation during my forthcoming visit to malaya.A.
