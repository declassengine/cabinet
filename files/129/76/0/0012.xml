(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE.PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-&quot; r     ---------------- -j secret.Pa(55) 625th July. 1955CABINETROAD HAULAGE DISPOSALSMemorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil aviation in C. (55) 59 I gave a report to my colleagues on the then positionof Road Haulage Disposals.    I indicated that sales in small units were continuing satisfactorilyj that sales in large units were negligible;  andthat it was probable that decisions&quot;would be required in the early summer,At the time of that paper 12,698 vehicles had been sold out of 18,347 offered for sale.The present position&quot;2,        Disposals began in November, 1953,&quot;   Twenty-three lists havebeen offered, 5 of them containing only vehicles which had been previouslyoffered, but the later lists have included vehicles of this kind as well asvehicles which had not been on offer before.    So far 24,569 vehicles havebeen offered and 15,668 sold.    The results of one list containing 1,3 66vehicles are not yet known,3.        Four thousand vehicles engaged on parcels work have with theappropriate premises been placed in a Parcels Company which&quot;it isintended to offer in&apos;the autumn.    Two thousand contract hire vehicles,under contract for example to Lyons, will, under an arrangement reached by the Commission, the Disposal Board and the Road Haulage association and approved by me, be offered for sale graduaUy up to the end of 1956,4.        Excluding the parcels and contract hire vehicles and about 1,000vehicles which the Commission say cannot be offered for sale, there are about 8,000 vehicles which have not yet been sold although all but about750 have been offered at least once.&apos; 5.        In March, the largest list (No. S0 4) comprising over 6,000vehicles in 160 medium and large units, was put on offer, and tendersclosed on 20th April.    Only 506 vehicles in 22 units were sold,    rumours of an Election may have contributed to the disappointing result, but &quot;theChairman of the Disposal Board had many&quot; months before told me he had &quot;failed to find any substantial interest in medium and large units or in salesby the Company method.6C        My colleagues will see that the conspicuous feature of thesituation as described in C0 (55) 59 continues, that is, that it is easy to soliin &quot;penny packets&quot;, and except in special cases virtually impossible, atany rate under the conditions laid down in the 1953 Act, to sell large units.COPY NO.
7.        The question for decision now therefore arises as to whether weare to continue to operate the Act of 1953, or take steps to&quot; amend it.&quot;The point now arises with special force because we have reached the point at which further disposals on any appreciable scale under the Act of 1953will necessarily involve the break-up of the main trunk services developed and now operated by British Road Services under the British transport commission.    The fundamental question is as to whether we wish to do this and if we do not what steps we should now take.The 1953 Act&quot;8.        Section 1 requires the Commission to dispose of all property held for the purposes of the old Road Haulage Executive except for a part which Section 4 permits the Commission to keep.    In terms of vehiclesthere were when the Act came into force about 32,500 to be sold and about,500 which the Commission could keep.9.        The Act provides for four methods of sale (a) by public tender for units comprising vehicles and premises or vehicles only, (b) by makingover property to Companies under the control of the Commission and byselling all the shares of the Company in one parcel, (c) by selling the shares of a Company by private treaty if the Commission think that thesale of shares by tender would be inappropriate and unlikely to secure thebest possible price and (d) by selling vehicles as chattels without the rightto special &quot;A&quot; licences.Views expressed by public bodies10,      A number of bodies have made their views known.    TheAssociation of British Chambers of Commerce greatly fear that BritishRoad Services trunk and regular services might be disrupted and that nocomparable services would take their place.    They have Suggested thatthe Act might be amended to enable the Commission to keep a larger number of vehicles or that preferably Companies should be formed-and upto, but not more than, 49 per cent of the shares sold, the balance being held by the Commission.ll.x     The Federation of British Industries stresses that the 1953 Actis a combined road and rail Act conceding greater freedom to the railways in the matter of charges in return for real competition from road haulage.If the Commission were to retain a huge trunk nucleus there would be too great a risk that the Commission would in hard times take advantage ofits position of virtual monopoly and arrange road and rail rates non-competitively.12a      The Road Haulage Association, fearing the failure of List S. 4,some months ago suggested to me and to the Disposal Board that greater use should be made of the Company methodo&quot;13.    &quot;The Trades Union Congress have pressedthat disposals should cease because apart from disrupting the present trunk services, sale in small units would, they think, jeopardise both the negotiating and consult&quot;ative machinery which has been established by the Unions and BritishRoad &quot;Services and present British Road Services standards of regular hours and vehicle&quot; maintenance,,&apos;&quot;   They think the effect on industrial relationsmight be serious and have recently asked to see me.
14.The following courses are open to us -(a) to leave the Act as it is, and go on putting up units for sale, mainly of course small units;(b) to amend the 1953 Act drastically so as to facilitatesale in larger units by the Company method;(c) to halt disposals, and legislate so as to convertBritish Road Services into a large company &quot;partly (either 49 per cent or 51 per cent) owned by the British Transport Commission, and place the balance of the shares on the market;(d) to put up List S.4, and another list of small units,announcing that these will be the last lists andthat British Road Services will retain vehiclesremaining unsold;(e) to halt disposals forthwith.All these courses, some of which could be followed in combination with others, would require legislation, except course (a).    Although theDisposal Board are under a statutory duty under the 1953 Act to proceed as speedily as possible with disposals, I understand from the Chairmanthat he would be prepared to hold up disposals if publicly requested bythe Government to do so, with the promise of subsequent legislation.In the absence of any Government action his duty is, of course, toproceed with disposals, and I understand List S. 4 will in the ordinary way be put up again towards the end of the month,15. I comment briefly on the courses indicated above and would wish to amplify this orally.(a) -    Though the prospects of sale of larger units have probablyimproved a little as a result of the General Election, theChairman of the Disposal   Board does not think thatif List S. 4 is put up again,as indicated in paragraph 14,that more than a few hundred of the 6,000 or so vehiclesWill be sold.    To make sure of disposal it would thenbe necessary to break these units up into &quot;pennypackets&quot;.    There is no indication that any of the bigger people ousted from the industry by the 1947 Actwish to return or that existing road haulage operatorswish to buy these larger units.    I have no doubt thatin small numbers they can eventually be sold off.    Todo so would involve the disappearance of British road services trunk services.    These have grown up sincethe war, and to destroy them would be severely criticised, and contrary&apos;to much of what was saidduring the passage of the 1953 Act.    As an indication of the feeling which this subject would arouse I maysay that the present Chairman of the Disposal   board would not remain to conduct the process.
(b) To make the sale of the larger units more attractiveas companies it would be necessary to legislate toamend the 1953 Act -(i) so as to permit Companies to be retained for a year or two after formation so thattrading results, etc. might be known!(ii)  so as to provide for transfer of goodwill, etc,by British Transport Commission, and toremove from the British transport commission their present right and duty to compete with units they have sold;(iii) to permit sale of shares from time to time, andnot, as under the present Act, in onetransaction.Such legislation would make sales somewhat less &quot;difficult.    But it would be bitterly opposed, and thethreats of re-nationalisation which would doubtless bemade would not help the sales.(c) If the new Company were under British Road Servicescontrol, this course would be subject to criticism &apos;that all we had done was to transfer a remunerativeinvestment from the British Transport Commissionto the City.    The sale of 49 per cent would similarlyleave British Road Services in de facto control, unlessone buyer could be arranged for the whole of theremainder of the shares.    This would be difficult toarrange without incurring the charge of favouringsome interest.(d)-      This involves the risk, if sale of List S. 4 is unexpectedlysuccessful, that we might damage trunk services while leaving the ruins of them in the British transport commission^ hands.    Such success is unlikely andthe consequence could be mitigated by allowing BritishRoad Services, in this event, to acquire additional&quot;A&quot; licences so as to repair the damage.    This coursehas the advantage over course (e) that it does not without warning deprive prospective buyers of any opportunity to buy.(e)       Is politically difficult and subject to criticisms made immediately above.16. All the above courses, and any variant on them, havedisadvantages.    On balance I prefer (d).170 I do so because I think it would be unfortunate to destroy the trunk services from a purely transport point of view.    It would leave a good deal of bitterness behind;   it would deprive the hard&quot;1pressed British Transport Commission of a substantial&quot;source ofrevenue;  and it is clear that if we wish to bring this question to anend, our position now after a successful General Election is strongo
It would, of course, be criticised by the extremists, and be subject tothe real criticism that it is unfair to those who bought lorries &quot;in the belief that British Road Services would not be there to compete withthem, at any rate on such a scale.18. If, however, my colleagues feel that disposal must becarried through, I think course (b) is the only feasible method.    Itwould, of course, involve highly controversial legislation and keep thedisposals problem alive for two or three years.19. It may help to put the matter in perspective if I mention that, despite the &quot;political feelings which are involved in this matter,we are concerned with some 8,000 general haulage vehicles out of171,600 &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; licensed vehicles on the roads&quot; of this country.There are in addition some 700,000 &quot;C&quot; licensed vehicles.20. If we decide to follow course (d) as I have suggested, thepresentational aspect would be reinforced by the fact that we had alreadysold half the total number of vehicles involved, and made arrangementsfor disposal of about one-fifth more; that the small man has beengiven, and has in large degree taken, the opportunity to come back into the industry; that the 25 mile limit on the private haulier has been abolished;  and that in these ways the object of the 1953 Act, the re-introduction of competition into the industry, has been achieved.21. I attach as an appendix a note on British Road Servicesfinance,22. In view of the present position, as indicated in the last sentence of paragraph 14, the matter is of some urgency.J.A.B.-C.Ministry of Transport, W.l.4th July, 1955.
1 c\0APPENDIXBRITISH ROAD SERVICES FINANCE1. During 1953 British Road Services showed net trafficreceipts (after meeting depreciation and renewals but before meetingcentral charges) of  8, 9 millions.    For last year at the end of which about 12,000 vehicles had been sold net traffic receipts were on thesame basis  8. 7 millions.2. At the end of 1953 when disposals began the net bookvalue of vehicles, property, plant and equipment was  41, 6 millions.In addition there was a goodwill figure of about  32 millions in theCommission^ books which has later been adjusted to  31.4 millions.Up to 26th March of this year, the latest date for which figures areavailable, the Commission had received about  17. 5 millions forassets whose net book value was  7.2 millions.    The surplus togetherwith payments from the Transport Fund created by the TransportLevy offsets the goodwill element in the Commission^ books adjusted to the assets sold and certain other charges.
