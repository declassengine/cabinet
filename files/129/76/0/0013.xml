(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET &apos;C.P.(55) 63 COPY NO.  /9th July, 1955CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1955/56 session memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the&apos; Cabinet, at their meeting on 28th June, 1955, agreed to review the state of the legislative programme again at an early meeting(C.M.(55) 18th Conclusions, Minute 7).    The Cabinet will remember that,in my earlier memorandum (C. P. (55) 52), I selected certain Bills whichI suggested should be introduced before Parliament adjourned for the summer recess, and certain other Bills which, I Suggested should be gotready for introduction immediately Parliament re-assembled in October.The present position&quot; on each of the Bills included in these two categoriesis set out in the Appendix.    Category A (Bills to be introduced before&quot;Parliament adjourns) contains two additional Bills which were suggested for early introduction during the Cabinefs last discussion, namely&quot;a rural Water Supply and Sewerage Bill and a Sudan Officials&apos; CompensationBill.&quot;2. The&quot; Bills of greatest significance in Category A are those on health, Welfare and Safety in Agriculture and Forestry, and Clean Air;-It now seems doubtful whether the former of these Bills can, in fact, begot ready for &quot;introduction before the end of this month.    Moreover, the chances of the Glean Air Bill being ready have also diminished on accountof difficulty in securing agreement on outstanding points of policy.    these points are due to be considered by the Cabinet on 12th July.&quot; If neither ofthese Bills iSi in fact, able to be introduced before Parliament adjourns,the Government will undoubtedly be in difficulties as regards the business to be taken when the House first re-^assembles after the summer recess.The only additional Bill of substance which &quot;it seems possible to considerfor introduction before the&apos;end of July is the Family&apos;Allowances Bill, thepolicy of which has now been approved.    It would clearly be most helpful to &quot;the programme if the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance could see his way to introducing this Bill before Parliament adjourns.H.C.JGwydyr House, S. W. 1.8th July, 1955.
