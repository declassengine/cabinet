1XO(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 6611th July, 1955CLEAN AIR bill memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentI have been invited by the Home Affairs Committee to submit to the Cabinet for decision a major question of policy which has arisen in the preparation of the Clean Air Bill (H.P.(55) 6th Meeting, Item 1).2, The Bill, as now drafted, provides that a Local Authority may,by Order subject to the Minister&apos;s approval, create a &quot;Smoke ControlArea&quot;, in which the emission of smoke would be an offence.    Such anOrder may, however, provide for the exemption of specified buildings orclasses of buildings, or of specified fireplaces&apos; or classes of fireplaces.This ensures the flexibility necessary to enable, for example; condemned .property, on which it wao undesirable to spend money, to be excluded.3. The question at issue is whether smoke from domesticchimneys should be included within the provisions of the Bill, and if so,to What extent should the owners of these houses be required to meet theexpense of adapting (where necessary) their fireplaces for burning smoke-less fuel.4. &quot; The Bill, as drafted, provides that half of any approvedexpenditure incurred on the adaptation of domestic fireplaces shall bemet as to 3 7^- per cent by the Exchequer and as to 12 j per cent by theLocal Authority.    In addition, Local Authorities are given discretion topay all or part of the remaining 50 per cent, though these additional payments would not attract further Exchequer grant.5. In the discussions at the Home Affairs Committee there v/as astrong feeling that these financial arrangements&quot; might place an excessiveburden upon Owners of house property.    However, it was not found j^ossibleto reach agreement upon the best method of meeting this difficulty.6. I was accordingly invited to submit to the Cabinet two possiblesolutions:-(a) that existing dwelling houses should be excludedaltogether from the operation of the Bill; and that,so far as the control of domestic smoke is concerned,we should confine ourselves to requiring that allhouses to be built in the future should be equipped with1 fireplaces suitable for burning smokeless fuels   or(b) that the minimum grant payable on approved expenditure incurred on the adaptation of domestic fireplaces shouldbe raised from 50 per cent (as proposed in the Bill) to75 per cent, of which 50 per cent would be paid by theExchequer and 25 per cent by the Local Authority.COPY NO.6  -hCABINET
7. The obvious attraction of alternative (a) is that it entirelyremoves all financial burden not only from house-owners,, but also fromthe Exchequer and the Local Authorities.    On the other hand, it is open tothe following objections:-(i)    The Cabinet authorised me to state in the SecondReading debate on Mr. Nabarro&apos;s Clean Air Billlast February &quot;that the Government had in hand the preparation of legislation to implement therecommendations of the Beaver Committee&quot;(C.C.(55) 8th Conclusions, Minute 10);  and itwasonly on the strength of this assurance that the Bill,which was warmly supported in all parts of the House,was withdrawn,(ii)   Measures to deal with domestic smoke form a fundamentaland integral part of the recommendations of the BeaverCommittee, who emphasised that &quot;nearly half Of all thesmoke iii the air comes from domestic chimneys&quot;; andthat there would be little justification for requiringindustry to take costly Steps to eliminate smoke fromfactory chimneys, if the problem of domestic smoke werenot tackled also.    (Paragraph 68 of Report).(iii)    The Federation of British Industries and the National Unionof Manufacturers have promised to co-operate incarrying through a clean air policy on the clear under-standing that it would apply to domestic as well as&quot;industrial smoke, on the lines recommended by theBeaver Committee.&apos; 8. The advantage of alternative (b) is that it reduces to &quot;areasonable&apos; level the &quot;expenditure which owners might have to &quot;meet, while at the same time adhering to the basic principles of the Beaver Committee^Report.    Itmay be objected that it would increase the charge upon public funds.&apos;   But this is far from certain.     The increase in the proportionpayable by Local Authorities from 12^r per cent to 25 per cent would undoubtedly make them more careful to avoid including in smoke controlareas the type of house property upon which heavy expenditure would be involved.    It must further be remembered that all such Orders requireconfirmation by the Minister,    The Government would, therefore, be ableto control the rate of expenditure and keep it within any given ceiling.9, &quot; Having regard to all the circumstances Ihave no hesitation in recommending that alternative (b) should be adopted and that the draftBill should be amended accordingly.D.S.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W.1,9th July, 1955,   ,
