*&quot;2 &quot;2 &quot;?THE TURCO-IRAQI PACTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsPakistan has announced its decision to accede to the Turco-Iraqi Pact to whichthe United Kingdom became a party last April.2. Pakistani accession will not materially affect our responsibilities. Article Iof the Turco-Iraqi Treaty reads as follows:  &quot; Consistent with article 51 of the United Nations Charter the HighContracting Parties will co-operate for their security and defence. such measures as they agree to take to give effect to this co-operation may form thesubject of special agreements with each other.&quot;It will be seen that this wording is very general and that in practice the accession of Pakistan will add little to our present (undefined) obligations to her as a memberof the Commonwealth.3. But Pakistani accession will bring into operation Article 6 of the Pact.This provides for the establishment of a Permanent Council of Ministers to functionwithin the framework of the purposes of the Pact, as soon as four Powers have become parties to it. This will not in itself increase the military commitments ofthe United Kingdom; but it will alter the look of the Pact. By giving it some machinery it will make it more important.4. We hope to keep the structure as simple and economical as possible. Thearrangements might be as follows:  (a) PoliticalA permanent council on the lines of the North Atlantic treaty organisation Council, on which all parties to the Pact would be represented.This might meet in Bagdad and the member States (other than Iraq) could berepresented by their Ambassadors acting as Deputies. There would also bethe occasional meetings of the Council at Ministerial level. Such meetingsmight be held in the capitals of any of the signatories.(b) MilitaryA permanent military planning organisation in Bagdad reporting to theCouncil. This should be on quite a small scale. There would be no command organisation at any rate in the first instance.5. Since it is most important to keep the Americans in step with us in our plans for Middle East Defence, these ideas are being discussed confidentiallybetween our Ambassador in Washington and the United States State Department.6. Of course, we want the Americans to join the Pact. They won&apos;t do so now,but they might later on.H. M.Paris,15th July, 1955.48416Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 cp.
