(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNIvIENT)SECRETCP0(55) 86 COPY NO.   fi l\20th July, 1955CABINETGUIDED WEAPONS TRAINING RANGE JN THE HEBRIDESNote by the Minister of defence on 13th July the Defence Committee approved the establishmentof a guided weapons training range in the Hebrides and invited me to bringthe project to the notice of the Cabinet before any public announcement was made (D.C.(55) 6th Meeting, Item 2).2.        I now circulate a draft of a non-oral Question and Answer aboutthe project.    The Answer has been prepared in consultation with theDepartments concerned and arrangements have been made for local interests to be informed in the next few days.3.        It is proposed to arrange for the Question to be put down forreply on Wednesday, 27th July, when the local interests will have beeninformed.S.L.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1.,20th July, 1955.QUESTION:To ask what action is to be taken to provide the Services witha guided weapons training range.ANSWER;Existing ranges suitable for guided weapon firing are usedprimarily for development work and have insufficient capacity to meetthe requirements of the Services for training in the operational use ofthese weapons.    The Government have, therefox*e, decided that in view ofthe great importance of proper operational training, a special range mustbe provided to be devoted primarily to this purpose.    After carefulconsideration they have concluded that the range must be in this countryjto establish it overseas would be impracticable not only because of thedifficulties of maintenance and supply, but because it would entail theabsence of front line units of the Home Forces for unacceptably long periods.
Investigations have shown that the only area in the United kingdom which is suitable for the purpose is in the Hebrides, with the rangehead onthe island of South Uist and with facilities on neighbouring islands for flying piloted and target aircraft.All firings will be made out to sea under clear range procedures and there should be no serious interference with fishing or shipping.There will be some encroachment on common grazing land but every effort will be made to limit the loss as much as possible, and compensation willbe payable.A detailed survey will be necessary before the precise areasrequired for the range can be determined.    There will be full opportunity,under the Services Land Requirements procedure, for the considerationof objections.Substantial numbers of men will be employed on the constructionof the range, many of whom it is hoped will be recruited locally.    the range is also expected to provide permanent employment for a numberof local residents.
