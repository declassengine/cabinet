(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 55 COPY NO.29th June, 1955CABINETEUROPEAN INTEGRATIONNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate for consideration a Report by officials on the implications of the communique issued after the recent MessinaConference of the six member countries of the European Coal and steel community.    It refers particularly to our attitude to the invitation tobe sent to us to join in the work arising out of the Conference.I propose to comment orally on this Report.R.A.B,29th June, 1955.
EUROPEAN INTEGRATION (MESSINA CONFERENCE)Report by officials the six member countries of the European Coal and steel community (E.C.S.C.) resolved at Messina to make further advancestowards the economic unification of Europe.    A Preparatory Committee(under the Chairmanship of M. Spaak) will draw up a report, as a prelim-inary to conferences which will be convened to work out treaties and otheragreements to implement the proposals for unification.    An invitation totake part in this work is to be sent to the United Kingdom, as a member of theWestern European Union and an associate of the Coal and Steel Community.2. A communique (Annex A) issued after the Messina meetingcontained a general statement on intent as follows:--&quot;(The Governments of the six countries) consider that itis necessary to work for the establishment of a unitedEurope by the development of common institutions, the progressive fusion of national economies, the creationof a common market and the progressive harmonisationof their social policies. &quot;3. In particular, the communique suggested the following asobjectives:-(a) joint development of major European channels ofcommunication  (including air transport);(b) co-ordination on questions affecting productionand consumption of power;(c) the creation of a common organisation for the peaceful development of atomic energy (to becarried out with the help of a common fund for finance and the pooling of raw materials and scientific results);(d) the establishment (by stages) of a European marketfree from all tariffs and quotas;(e) the creation of a European Investment Fund;(f) harmonisation of social policies, in the field ofworking hours, overtime rates, etc. ;(g) a gradual increase in the free movement of manpower.4, Dr. Beyen, the Netherlands Foreign Minister and recentlyacting as Chairman of the Foreign Ministers of the six countries, has beenin London for informal discussions on these matters.    In particular heattended a meeting under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequerwith the Ministers principally concerned (the minutes of this meeting areat Annex B).    The meeting confirmed the impression already formed, thatthis move by the six countries is inspired as much by political as by economic
motives, and is regarded by some as a further means of binding Germanyto Western Europe.    Dr. Beyen said that the six believed that their aimscould not be achieved by institutions functioning on the basis of inter-governmental co-operation; they seek a manifestation of the &quot;community&quot;idea.    While they do not wish to set up a series of High Authorities on the model of the Coal and Steel Community, their aim, according to Dr. Beyen,seems to be to devise some form of community institution which (a) has some responsibility of its own and (b) is responsible to a common politicalassembly.5, It appears that the problems on which the Preparatory Committeeis likely to lay particular emphasis are the creation of a co-ordinating body for atomic energy, and the establishment of a common market (probablysheltered behind tariff barriers).    On these two specific points our attitudemust be governed by the following considerations:-(a) Atomic energy the United Kingdom cannot be committted on future arrangements.It must be borne in mind that we are already engaged in international discussions on the peaceful use of atomic energy, both in the organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E;.C.) and elsewhere, and that weare already involved in bilateral associations with two of the six countrieswhich took part in the Messina Conference (France and Belgium).    It isclear that in a general organisation of the sort envisaged we would have much to give but little to gain.    We cannot of course prevent other countriescombining in a common organisation for the development of atomic energyif they so wish, and we might eventually find it useful to have some form of association with it.(b) Common European MarketWe have repeatedly made it clear that we cannot accept as an objective for ourselves the creation of or participation in a common market.It may be however the intention of the six Governments that they should dono more than consult with us as to how best they could achieve a common market among themselves.    We could not object to this; but the process which they envisage would almost certainly affect the obligations which the six GCvernments (and also the United Kingdom) already have to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) and the O.E.E.C.   Moreover,developments of this kind may lead to some form of discriminatory blocin Europe, even though the six countries profess that their aim is to encouragecompetition and economic efficiency by creating a wider and freer market.The low tariff European countries would no doubt deny that they wanted tosee the common market protected from the competition of third countries,and claim that such a development could be inconsistent with their basicaim; but Dr. Beyen admitted that it would certainly be easier to secure agreement among the six if the group were able to discriminate against therest of the world and work for their objectives over a lengthy transitional period in which such discrimination would be abated only as the common market developed strength.6. Discussions on integration in the fields of transport and power(and to some extent atomic energy as well) seem likely to duplicate work being done in O.E.E.C. or which could be undertaken by the EuropeanConference of Ministers of Transport.    Holding as we do the chairmanship of Q.E.E,C. we must be careful not to give in any way the impression thatwe are weakening its status.    On this point Dr. Beyen&apos;s assurances werenot satisfactory and there is a danger, which we must resist, that these freshdevelopments would either confuse existing counsels in Europe or indeeddisplace them.
7. The United Kingdom reply to the invitation should therefore becoupled with reservations about our own attitude to the solutions which aresuggested by the Messina Conference.    Each of the separate proposalslisted in paragraph 3 above causes difficulties, but it would be preferable to make a general reservation in connection with the statement of intentionof the Messina Conference which is quoted at paragraph 2 above.    TheUnited Kingdom does not accept the objectives on which the six countries have agreed in principle, and joining in discussion to work out the meansof achieving their aims must not be taken to commit us in any way to joiningor supporting any common institutions which may be set up.    This reser-vation should be made publicly known, to avoid any misunderstanding of ourposition either at home or in Europe.8. It is not suggested that we should reject an invitation to take partin discussions.    There is much in these proposals as they stand at presentwhich is unacceptable, but in itself this may be an argument for joining the discussions.    We cannot stop the six countries doing what they want,but if we accept their invitation we can seek to ensure that their actionsare as little prejudicial to our interests as possible.    And it may be possibleto guide their thought towards suggestions for forms of co-operation inwhich we would be willing to join.9. Politically- refusal to have anything to do with the work of thePreparatory Committee would undoubtedly be misunderstood by the countrieslaunching it and would tend to undo some of the good achieved by the lead we gave in creasing W.E.U. and associating ourselves with the E.C.S.C.   More-over, though we might have preferred a pause for thought in Europe before any re-opening of controversial issues, we have a strong interest in any newlinks binding Germany with the West and, in principle, can only look withfavour on efforts by the Messina countries to achieve closer association between themselves, provided their association does not create a cleavagebetween them and us.    We have a perfectly good standing as a countryassociated with the E.C.S.C. (from outside) and a member of W.S.U. forattending the talks without committing ourselves in any way to the specificnew objectives of the Messina Conference^10. \      If the invitation is accepted, it is necessary to consider the alternatives of full membership of the Preparatory Committee or the associa-tion with it of British observers.    Since the objectives set out in the Messinacommunique are unacceptable, it does not seem appropriate for the UnitedKingdom to have more than observer status in the proposed Committee.    Itis understood that the observer status would not detract from the part we might play in the counsels of the six countries and to that extent the usualobjections to such status do not apply.    The impression obtained from thediscussion with Dr. Beyen was that the proposals of the Messina conference were strongly influenced by political motives.    They have not been very carefully thought out and may well increase rather than reduce the difficultiesof the movement towards multilateral trading policies which are being pursued in other international organisations.    It is thought therefore that it would bebetter not to become too closely identified with the deliberations of thePreparatory Committee.Re commendations11. It is recommended that Ministers should agree thatt-(i)   when we receive an invitation to take part in the work ofthe Preparatory Committee, we should accept, but asobservers only;
(ii)  in doing so, we should publicly make a general reservationas suggested in paragraph 7 above, and should emphasise that we attach great importance to full collaboration withOJE.E.C. and the avoidance of unnecessary duplication of effort or of institutions;(iii) a directive to our representatives should be inter-departmentally agreed at the official level;(iv) we should explain our intentions beforehand to the scandinavian countries, who are the most important group of O.E.E.C..countries not covered by the Messina proposals, and to othermembers of the Commonwealth,\
MM a communique ISSUED AT THE CONCLUSIONOP THE MESSINA conference the Governments of the Federal German Republic, Belgium, France,Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands believe that the time has cometo make a fresh advance towards the building of Europe.    They areof the opinion that that  must be achieved, first of all, in theeconomic field.2.      They consider that it is necessary to work for the establish-ment of a united Europe by the development of common institutions,the progressive fusion of national economies, the creation of acommon market and the progressive harmonisation of their socialpolicies.3.      Such a policy seems to them indispensable if Europe is tomaintain her position in the world, regain her influence and prestige and achieve a continuing increase in the standard oflivin^ of her population,,h.     To these ends, the six Ministers have agreed on the followingobjectives:-1)   The expansion of trade and the freedom of movement call for the joint development of the major channels ofcommunication,    A joint study will accordingly be under-taken of development plans based on the establishment ofa European network of canals, motor highways, electrifiedrailways and on a standardisation of equipment, as wellas a study of possible means of achieving a betterco-ordination of air transport.2)   A fundamental condition of economic progress is that theEuropean economies should have at their disposal cheaper,and more plentiful supplies of power.    For this reason,xall possible steps will have to be taken to developexchanges of gas and electricity as necessary to increasethe profitability of investment and to.reduce the costof supplies.    Study will be given to methods forco-ordinating a joint approach to questions affecting thefuture production aifd consumption of power, and fordrawing up the general lines of an overall policy.3)    The development of atomic energy for peaceful purposeswill in the near future open up the prospect of a new industrial revolution out of all proportion to thatwhich has taken place over the last hundred years.The six signatory States consider that it is necessaryto study the creation of a common organisation to beentrusted with the responsibility and the means for ensuring the peaceful development of atomic energy,while taking into account the special arrangementsmade by certain Governments with third countries.These means should comprise:/(a)    The
(a) The establishment of a common fund derived from contributions from each of the participating countries, from which provision could be made for financing the installations and research workalready in progress or planned.(b) Free and sufficient access to the raw materials,and the free exchange of expertise and technicians,by-products and specialised equipment.(c) The pooling of the results obtained and the grantof financial assistance for their exploitation.(d) Co-operation v/ith non-member countries.5*     The six Governments recognise that the establishment of a european market, free from all customs duties and all quantitative restrictions, is the objective of their action in the field ofeconomic policy.    They consider that this market must be achieved by uoages and that its entry into force requires a study of thefollowing questions:(a) The appropriate procedure and pace for the progressive    suppression of the obstacles totrade in the relations between the participating countries, as well as the appropriate measures for moving towards a progressive unification of theirtariffs against third countries.(b) The measures to be taken for harmonising thegeneral policy of the participating countries inthe financial, economic and social fields.(c) The adoption of methods designed to make possiblean adequate co-ordination of the monetary policies of the member countries so as to permit the creationand development of a common market.(d) A system of escape clauses.(e) The creation and operation of a readaptationfund.(f) The gradual introduction of the free movementof manpower.(g) The elaboration of rules which would ensure theplay of competition within the common market soas to exclude, in particular, all discriminationon a national basis.(h) The institutional arrangements appropriate for introducing and operating the common market.6.     The creation of a European Investment Fund will be studied.The object of this fund would be the joint development ofEuropean economic potentialities and in particular the developmentof the less developed regions of the participating states.7.     As regards the social field, the six Governments consider it essential to study the progressive harmonisation of theregulations in force in the different countries, notably those/which
which concern working hours, overtime rates (night work, Sunday-work and public holidays) and the length and rates of pay forholidays,8.     The six Governments have decided to adopt the following procedure:-l)    Conferences will be called to work out treatiesor other arrangements concerning the questionsunder consideration.2)    The. preparatory work will be the responsibilityof a Committee of Governmental representatives,assisted by experts, under the chairmanship of apolitical personality responsible for co-ordinating the work in the different fields.3)    The Committee will invite the High Authority ofthe E.C.S.C. and the Secretariats of O.E.E.C.,the Council of Europe and the European Conferenceof Ministers of Transport, to give the necessaryassistance.k)   The report of the Committee, covering the wholefield, will be submitted to the Ministers ofForeign Affairs by not later than the 1st ofOctober 1955.5)   The Ministers for Foreign Affairs will meet before that date to take note of the interim reportsprepared by the Committee and to give it thenecessary directives,6)   The Government of the United Kingdom, as a power which is a member of W.E.U. and is alsoassociated with the E.C.S.C., will be invitedto take part in this work.7)    The Ministers for Foreign Affairs will decide indue course whether other States should subse-quently be invited to take part in the conference or conferences referred to in paragraph l) above.

EUROPEAN INTEGRATIONDR. BEYEN outlined the background to the Conference ofttye Foreign Ministers of the member countries Of the european coal and Steel Community (E.C.S.C.) recently held at Messina.It had been felt by the Benelux Governments that there was a danger of confusion arising between the interests of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.3.C.)in such matters as energy and transport and those of the member countries of E.C.S.C.  and that it would be wise to attempt tocanalize the work to be done in promoting further european co-operation and integration in these and in other economic fields,,There had also been a danger of a drift back to bilateraleconomic relations between European countries.    It had therefore been decided at the Messina Conference to set up a committee with the task of preparing for a conference on the various aspects of further European economic integration.    The subjects to be studied were not limited to those of most direct concern to the members of the E.C.S.C., but it had been decided that progress would best be made if the preparatory work wereinitiated by the six member countries with expert assistancefrom existing organisations? such as the O.E.E.C.,,  the EuropeanConference of Ministers of Transport and the Council of Europe.It had. also been decided to invite the United Kingdom toparticipate in the preparatory work of the Committee from the outset, and the six countries very much hoped that the UnitedKingdom, would be able to accept the invitation.    The preparatory committee, over which M. Spaak had agreed to preside, would,in addition to its other tasks? consider which non-E.C.S.C.countries should be invited to participate in the ensuingConference.    The Committee would doubtless find it convenient to work mainly through sub-committees composed of experts inthe various subjects appointed by the Governments concerned.It. was not the intention of. the six countries concerned toestablish a multiplicity of &quot;high authorities&quot; for the differentsubjects mentioned in the Messina communique, but they adhered to their view that the most effective form of organisation for their purposes.would be a &quot;community&quot;, comprising an executive authority responsible to a common assembly, ratherthan an inter-governmental organisation.    They realised,however, that the United Kingdom could not accept thesupra-national principle and could not therefore become a full member of any body of that nature which might be set up as aresult of the work to be undertaken.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the UnitedKingdom Government were grateful to have this opportunity of discussing with Dr. Beyen and his advisers the proposals containedin the Messina communique.    He wished to make it clear,.in orderto avoid possible misunderstanding,  that the United Kingdom.Government could not, without considerable further study, reach a decision on whether they could accept the invitation whichwas to be addressed to them, to participate in the work of thePreparatory Committee.    Speaking as Chairman of the ministerial council of O.S.3.C., he was disturbed by the prospect ofconsiderable duplication between, the activities of O.E.E.C.and the work envisaged in the communique.    He hoped that therewould be detailed discussions between the six countries and theC.E.E.C. as to how this duplication could best be avoided.
He himself had two main points.    First, the proposed commonEuropean market might in some ways run counter to the objectives of the O.E.E.C. Code of Liberalisation and the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).    Second, previous proposalsfor the creation of a European Investment Fund had been criticised by the International Bank and it was not clear in what respects the present proposals differed.    He would ask the United kingdom ministers present to put to Dre Beyen specific questions arising from the communique which concerned their particularfields of responsibility.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the precise form whichinternational co-operation in the development of nuclear energyfor peaceful purposes should take had not yet crystallised.The O.S.S.C. were actively interested and an importantinternational conference was to be held in Geneva in August.He thought that progress would be retarded if further bodiesundertook exploratory work in this field.    It would in any event be difficult for the United Kingdom to envisage further action until the Working Group recently established by O.E.S.C,had submitted its report.DR. BSYSN said that the prospect of the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes made a strong appeal to public imagination in Europe, and there was considerable pressure on the Governments concerned to establish an organisation for the common production of nuclear energy.    Hethought that the invitation which was to be issued to O.S.E.C.to participate in the work of the Committee should serve toavoid any duplication with the work recently put in hand bythat Organisation.    It might be desirable for the six E.C.S.C.countries to agree with G.E.S.C. on the establishment of a newjoint body to co-ordinate the various enquiries which were proceeding in this field.   As regards the proposed EuropeanInvestment Fund, the fact that it had been included in the communique as a subject for further study did not rule out thepossibility of carrying out the objectives in some other way, e.g.by setting up a new branch of the International Bank.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that the proposalto establish a common market raised fundamental issues ofcommercial policy,    Was it envisaged that the common market should be protected      a tariff wall against the outside world,and that the United Kingdom should be invited to join such a market?DR. BEYSN said that the Benelux countries did not considerthat a tariff barrier should be erected between the common market and the outside world, but it had to be recognised thatit would be easier to persuade other countries to join thecommon market if it were to be protected in that way.    he agreed that existing obligations under the O.E.S.C. Code of liberalisation and the General Agreement on Tariffs and trade might prove serious obstacles to the establishment of such a market.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT asked how it was proposed thatthe studies to be undertaken of the possibilities of co-ordinationof ground transport, in particular highways and railways, shouldbe separated from the work of the European Conference of ministers of Transport.    There was an even greater risk of duplication inthe case of air transport, since there was apparently no provisionfor collaboration with the Secretariat of the International CivilAviation Organisation.
DR. BEYEN said that the section of the Messinacommunique dealing with transport was perhaps not as explicitas it should have been.    He assumed that the preparatory committee would set up a Sub-Committee on Transport, whichwould maintain the necessary contact with the work of existing organisations in this field.    He thought that the question offurther co-ordination in air transport might in practice not be pursued.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thanked Dr0 Beyen for the explanations he had given, and hoped that Dr. Beyen would fullyunderstand that no indication could be given at this stage of the policy which the United Kingdom Government would adopting regard to the matters which had been discussed.    He wouldnot wish to underestimate the difficulties for the UnitedKingdom in co-operating with the six E0C.S0C. countries in themanner proposed, particularly in atomic energy and the approachtowards a cus-coms union.    The United Kingdom attachedconsiderable importance to the role of the O.E.E.C. in promoting European economic co-operation and development, andhe hoped that the six Eo0oS,,C.  countries, in working towardsfurther integration, would collaborate fully with theOrganisation,Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd June, 1955&quot;
