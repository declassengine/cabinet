BHHHHHHHHHI      WMthis document is the property of her britannic majestvs governmentThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No..^..?..C.P.(55) 5327th June, 1955CABINETMALTA;  CLAIM FOR representation in PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Maltese party leaders (the Prime Minister, Mr. Mintoff,representing the Malta Labour Party, and Dr. Borg Olivier, representingthe Nationalist Party), are now in London for round table talks about theoffer to transfer responsibility for Maltese affairs to the Home Secretary,and about any Maltese proposals arising out of that offer.2. Mr. Mintoff won the elction last February on a policy of integration of Malta with the United Kingdom.    This is summarised inits latest form in the memorandum reproduced as Annex I.3. I shall be reporting to my colleagues in due course on how much of this proposal for closer association with the United Kingdomappears to be financially or otherwise practicable;  but it would be helpful to know their views at this stage on the proposal for representation at westminster,, which Mr. Mintoff puts forward as a cardinal feature inhis plan.4. This proposal has been given considerable thought already.Attached at Annex II is an extract from the 1951 Report of the Committeeof Enquiry into Constitutional Development in the Smaller colonial territories.    The recommendation was against considering Malta and gibraltar for inclusion in the United Kingdom, with representation inParliament.5. . My predecessor put this point to his colleagues last year inCo (54) 141 of the 14th April, 1954.    I reproduce in Annex III an extractfrom the argument in that paper.    C.C.(54) 29th Conclusions, Mlinute 6records that  &quot;there was general agreement that representation of Maltain the Parliament at Westminster could not be contemplated. &quot;6. The arguments previously adduced have obvious force, but arenot necessarily conclusive.    If the Maltese Members belonged to different parties, their presence would scarcely affect the balance of parties at Westminster.    The unique position of Malta, recognised by&quot;the Home Office offer&quot;, could be cited as sufficient reason for refusal to extend the system to other territories.7. If full membership of the House of Commons could not be accorded, the proposal might take the shape that Maltese Members should sit in the House of Commons, without the right to vote except on matters-1-
closely concerning Malta itself.    (The Maltese Governments advisersare known, to have been making a close study of parallels from the representation of Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico in Congress).Annex IV gives a summary of these United States arrangements, and also of the French system for colonial representation in Paris.    But neither of these systems appears to be working to the entire satisfaction of itsbeneficiaries.8. Another possibility would be the devising of some system,short of Maltese representation at Westminster, that would link parliament with the Maltese Legislature through some form of joint committee orassembly.    I give in Annex V a type of arrangement that might betentatively suggested.9, The proposal to link Malta closely with us, in contrast totendencies so prevalent elsewhere, must command at least sympathy.(Sir George Schuster said to me, that we might find ourselves at thesame time, shooting down Cypriots because they wanted to join greece and Maltese because they wanted to join Britain).10. There are indications that some (but by no means all) Membersof all parties are attracted by the possibility of meeting the claim for representation in some shape or form. The best course might be torefer the question to a Speakers Conference or to a Select Committee.11. There are certainly great difficulties in all these solutions,one of them being illustrated by the passage from a letter addressed bythe Roman Catholic Archbishop of Malta to the Governor, which isquoted in Annex VI, but which is I think based on a serious misunder-standing as to the effects on the Roman Catholic Church of 1 integration&apos;.12. I have no doubt that if the principle of representation at westminster is turned down, Mintoff will come forward with an intolerablealternative, independence with a Defence Treaty and considerable financial aid from the United Kingdom.    In this, the two Delegations, divided hithertomight well be united,     V/e might in negotiation be able to find someacceptable alternative but I am not very hopeful.    I should like to discuss this with my colleagues.A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.27th June,1955.-2-
2. We shall now indicate the broad principles under each of these three headings on which we hope agreement can be secured at this conference, leaving the examination and solution of details to a later stage.(A) C onstitutionalThere should be a Maltese Parliament which should consist ofa one House Legislature.Elections to the Maltese Parliament should be based on universaladult suffrage.    The present system of proportional representation shouldbe replaced by the British system of direct voting,The legislative powers reserved to the Maltese parliament should extend to all matters other than foreign relations, defence and direct taxation (Income Tax and Death Duties).    The matters excludedwould be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Imperial Parliament.The Constitution Act of the Imperial Parliament should giveMalta the right to send not less than three members to the House ofCommons with full powers.(B) economic the United Kingdom should agree to extend help in the economicand social development of the Islands.    This, in part, is in consideration for the facilities in the Islands and in payment on local taxation on behalfof the Imperial and Allied Forces to maintain common sexwices, includingeducation, on the Islands.(a) There should be agreement in principle for the United KingdomGovernment to contribute to recurrent expenditure for a first period of, say, ten years on the framework of developsment of Malta and the size of the Imperial contribution to it.The independent economic experts put the sum needed underthis heading at  1B 5 millions per annum, increasing as the educational facilities are expanded towards the minimumMEMORANDUM BY THE MALTA GOVERNMENTDELEGATIONAide Memoire on Constitutional, Economic andAdministrative proposals we have in our First Memorandum given only the barest possibleindication of the practical proposals by which the principles put forward inthat document can be expeditiously implemented.    We indicated that thenew Constitution should be modelled on Northern Ireland with such modifica-tions as appeared necessary to meet the particular problems of Malta0Adequate aid was in our submission necessary to provide a solution for theunbalance of the Maltese economy and administrative organs had to be devised to take the place of the dyarchical system which never has, inpractice, fulfilled the hopes placed in it by its authors.
level needed, and certain additional social services aredeveloped which are essential for the smooth functioning ofthe Maltese social and economic system.    We anticipate,however, that with the increase in Maltese national income and revenue this contribution will later decline.(b)    Make a contribution administered by the London Inter-Governmental Committee to the capital cost of develop-ment so as to make up the deficiency of the War DamageFund and after its gradual exhaustion to provide a basis forthe capital investment needed for the diversification of the island *s economy.    The economic experts put this sumtentatively rising to  3- 3, 5 millions per annum as the war damage Fund is exhausted.(c) Use her good offices to facilitate the procurement of loans atfavourable terms through the Local Loans Fund, through theLondon market or from international agencies.(d) Undertake to extend to Malta the benefits of a double taxationagreement.(e) Include the Islands in the benefits of the &quot;Special Area&quot; Acts.(f) Provide experts needed to start the development programme -technical, administrative and commercial.(g) Persuade firms in the United Kingdom (if necessary through theuse of so-called &quot;experimental&quot; contracts) to open branchfactories in Malta, and to establish suitable Governmentworks (e. g. atomic energy) in Malta.(h) Make use of Maltese factories in the supply of Forces based in Malta.As Maltese reconstruction proceeds, and Maltese supplies ofcapital (as well as capacity to borrow) increase, the direct capital contribu-tion will also tend to decline.    Eventually the British contribution underboth headings will reach the level appropriate as the permanent annual contribution of the Imperial Forces to the general overhead costs of the islands.    In this transition period direct taxation will fall under thecompetence of the Malta Government and Parliament acting on the advice of the Mixed Committee specified under heading (c) of the next section.The Imperial contribution and the capital expenditure projects on theother hand will fall under the jurisdiction of the London Inter-governmental committee - section (d).    Finally, at the end of the transition period, anew settlement will have to be made in which Malta shares the burdensand receives the benefits of full membership of the United Kingdom.(C) AdministrativeThe Administration shall have four components(a) A local Maltese Administration run   solely by the maltese government.(b) An Imperial Branch responsible solely to Westminster inso far as foreign affairs and defence are concerned.
(c) A combination of (a) and (b) on a basis of absolute parityand presided over by the Maltese Minister of Finance todetermine -(i) the tempo of increase in direct taxation;(ii) the progressive betterment of social servicestowards the British level;(iii) the co-ordination of wages and their upgradingtowards British standards J  and(iv) to scrutinise economic trends and make recommendations on economic projects to the maltese Cabinet.(d) An inter-governmental Committee in London of Cabinet rankmeeting periodically, and representing the British Governmentand the Maltese Government and presided over by the HomeSecretary.    The Committee^ functions shall consist mainly in supervising the economic plans submitted to it by the maltese Government.    It should act as a means of consulta-tion on the size of Service expenditure and on the measures necessary to maintain full employment on the Island.    TheCommittee should have executive powers and it should havethe services of a permanent secretariat to keep thedevelopment of Malta under constant review.
annex iiextract from the repoiit of. the committee. 01&apos;&apos; enquiry intoconstitutional- developllilct &quot;in the smaller colonial teeri-tories5 august, 1951.&quot;Incorporation in the United Kingdom is another possible solution of the problems of the future of the smaller terri-tories which we have considered and rejected.     By incorporationwe mean an arrangement by which an overseas territory would notbe regarded as a separate political unit, but as part of theUnited Kingdom.      Such an arrangement clearly implies that thepeople of the territory should be represented in the Parliamentof the United Kingdom ... Gibraltar and Malta are the two territories for which we think, incorporation would be most appropriate and we have given special consideration to their cases.     We understand that in G-ibraltar local opinion seemsdefinitely in favour of a closer link with the United Kingdom,and it is of course by far the nearest of the territories underreview.     But its population is much smaller than that of a normal parliamentary constituency and, from a local governmentpoint of view,  falls far below that of a normal county borough.Malta on the other hand has the requisite population both for parliamentary and for local government purposes.     But if both these territories were to be regarded as qualifying for incor-poration,  the fact that their populations are predominantlywhite might lead to charges of racial discrimination withunfortunate repercussions elsewhere;    and if only Gibraltarwore considered,  its new relationship with the United kingdom might be regarded as having special significance and wouldprobably give rise to strong adverse reactions in Spain.     Forall these reasons,  therefore, we conclude that the inclusion inthe United Kingdom of any of the smaller territories is not apractical possibility.&quot;
AN1-05X IIIEXTRACT FROM MEMORANDUM BY VISCOUNT 0 HAND OSTO THE CABINET C. C5k) lhl&apos;&quot;of li fch APRIL, 2.95k-&quot;For the moment,  the idea of integration with the UnitedKingdom depends very largely on whether representation of Maltaat Westminster can he seriously considered.     The number of maltese representatives would he about three,  judging- by the size of their electorate.     There are massive arguments against such a system.     First,  the precedent would be created and other territories might claim the same privilege .,.    Secondly, sucha system, which has some resemblance to the Union Francaise, hasthe inherent defect that the Members elected from those terri-tories soon lose touch and influence with their constituents andhave little or nothing to contribute in the day to day life ofParliament at Westminster.     Thirdly, in a Parliament wherethere is a small balance between the two great parties the few&quot;oversea&quot; Members might have a power over our domestic affairsout of all relation to their knowledge or responsibility .....&quot;.\
annex iv-UNITED STATES AND FRENCH systems OF REPRESENTATIONOF OVERSEAS TERRITORIES in THE METROPOLITAN LEGISLATURESUnited States TerritoriesAlaska and Hawaii are United States Dependencies, which have sought Statehood for &quot;iany years, hut so far without success.The Federal Government has complete:- authority over the dependencies, and Congress has the power to make all necessaryrules and regulations; respecting them.     Congress can pass lawswhich apply to or car. he extended to the Dependencies without consultation, or it can delegate powers to the local legislaturesAlaska and Hawaii each elect one delegate every two years, who issent to Congress with voice hut not voto.     Criticisms have,however, been made that their presence is in no way tantamount to representation of the peoples of the territories in Congress.The Commonwealth, of Puerto Rico has full internal self-government, its relations with the United States being governed by an Organic Act passed by Congress.     The United StatesFederal authorities directly control foreign affairs, defence,immigration,  tariffs, etc.      Puerto Rico is represented in washington by a Resident Commissioner elected every four years,who is a non-voting member of the House of Representatives.    Hehas the right to address committees,  and is responsible for introducing legislation relating to Puerto Rico.     He also hasthe right to address the House.French systemFrench colonies forming part of the French Union are represented in the Assembly of the Union, a consultative body,and in the National Assembly.     The proportion of Deputies toelectors is not, however,  so great in overseas territories as in metropolitan France.-The Assembly of the Union is at present houses inVersailles, remote from the political centre in Paris.     its members, who are separately elected,   tend,  therefore,  to beinferior politicians, unable to secure election to the national assembly.     It therefore tends to be a quite unimportant body.Some French territories, physically overseas, are treated in all respects as departments of Metropolitan France.     What issaid above relates to those oversea territories that are notdepartments.     The presence in the National Assembly of a sub-stantial number of overseas Deputies not necessarily attachedpermanently to French political parties but nevertheless votingupon purely metropolitan issues raises certain problems.     Undereffective leadership such as is currently provided bym. Senghor,  the Deputy for Senegal,  this group can sway the vote on an evenly contested issue and can use this power as a bargaining counter to obtain concessions in overseas territories.A further disadvantage of this system is that the Oversea Deputyis frequently quite remote from his home territory which he maynot have visited except spasmodically over a period of years.There appears to have been a considerable change recentlyin French political thinking about their colonial problems.   the trend of informed opinion in France and the French Union is nowaway from the idea of maintaining the Union as a close unitarysystem, and towards the establishment of something more in thenature of a federation.
TENTATIVE SUGGESTION FOR A SELECT COMMITTEEON MALTESE AFFAIRSThe House of Commons might appoint a Select Committeeon Maltese Affairs, without power to hear evidence, &quot;but with power to consult such members of the Maltese Legislature as might be appointed for the purpose.     The Committee could sit in London ors as necessary, in Malta.     The MalteseLegislature would similarly appoint its Select Committee with power to consult such members of the House of Commons as might be appointed for the purpose.      This body might also sit in London if necessary.     Each House would appoint itsCommittee by its normal method.      The two Committees mightsit and debate together, either in Malta or London, as they&apos;wished.      The terms of reference of each Committee would beto consider such matters as were referred to it by its government, and to report to its parent House.Such an arrangement would provide the Maltese with anopportunity to discuss matters of common interest with members of Parliament, and so to air their grievances and aspirations.      It would go far to meet any complaint thatthey have   no direct access to the ultimate legislative andfinancial authority in this country.      There are, however,disadvantages in providing an opportunity for debates ofthis kind which would no doubt be largely conducted, atany rate on the United Kingdom side, by private Members,whereas the proper channel for Maltese representations is between responsible Maltese Ministers and responsible ministers in the United Kingdom.These disadvantages could be avoided by creating a consultative body in London to which Maltese ministers would be able to come periodically for consultation with united Kingdom Ministers on matters of current concern.      Itwould, however, be the revival of a proposal that was dis-cussed with the Maltese Government a few years ago, and ultimately rejected by the then Maltese Prime Minister.      Thepresent Maltese Government might regard the establishment ofsuch machinery as going some way towards enabling them tobiding their views directly before United Kingdom Ministers inLondon.
ANKEX   VIExtract from recent letter from Monsignor Michael G-onzi,Roman Catholic Archhishop of Malta, to the G-governor&quot;There is, however, one point of jirinciple, on whichI may comment now, and that is that the Church would view with disfavour any proposal whereby the people of these islands were to be absorbed as a unit of the United Kingdomv/ith representatives in the British Parliament, since thisabsorption would, without any doubt, create difficulties,which sooner or later are bound to be the cause of trouble.The absorption of -peoples with different customs, languageand religion is an unnatural union, as history has shown.In the circumstances &quot;the Church would be unable to co-operate with Her Majesty&apos;s Government,  should any dispute ariseregarding any matter affecting the supremacy of the CatholicReligion in these Islands&quot;.
