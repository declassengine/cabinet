A.E.&apos;17th July, 1955PALESTINEI had a talk with the President for three-quarters of an hour this afternoon,,    We began with some discussion of Alpha, when Igave him a copy of the attached memorandum (C,P.(55) 75).    ThePresident read it carefully and said that he would of course considerit.    He had not quite understood that our two countries were not incomplete agreement on the line to be taken.    I said that we had been inentire agreement and still were as to the terms of a possible settlementbut hitherto we had also wanted to negotiate it secretly with the two sides.    Admittedly we had not made much progress.    Now the proposal was for a public statement by the United States.    This raised important considerations.    I felt in some doubt about how the Arabs would takethe statement and of course the main burden in that part of the world if anything went wrong would fall upon us, since we had forces and interestthere.    On the other hand I also understood how much the problem ofthe Jews loomed in American domestic politics.    The President saidthat the latter was true.    There was no Arab Lobby,nor I interjected,a British Lobby either *    The President laughed and said we had notto trouble about that.    The only reaction there against very friendly relations between Britain and the United States came from the small but vocal Irish group.    Reverting to the Jewish situation the president said that he wondered whether it was really necessary to take a decisionto make such a statement now.    He would like to think the whole matter over, and we could talk about it again before I left,2. As to the off-shore purchases he would tell me frankly hisdifficulty.    If we could give a little help, however small, in these mattersourselves his task would be easier.    Whenever he asked for appropriationsfrom Congress they were apt to complain that nobody else seemed to betaking a share.    He did not want to put undue burdens on us at a timewhen we were just getting our head above water but if he could find someway of showing that we ourselves were also bearing part of the burdeneconomically he would be in a much stronger position to help.    I under-stood him to add that Congress had been more reasonable recently aboutgiving him latitude in the use of the appropriations they had voted.Finally the President asked me if I knew how large an order for tanksthis would be,    I said I did not know, but I imagined something in theorder of 100 would be quite important in the scale.    The Presidentreplied that in that case he felt sure they could do something.    He would get into touch with St&amp;sean  who was still in Paris or with some other authority to try to get me an answer before I left.    I said I should be grateful for that because I was quite sure that if we were going to act inthis matter the sooner we could reach agreement and, that the soonerthe Iraqis knew that the tanks were coming the better it would be.
germany in the course of the conversation alone with thePresident this afternoon we reviewed the discussion that hadtaken place with Monsieur Faure and the three foreign secretaries in the morning,,    The President said that hethought he had persuaded Monsieur Faure not to refer to thequestion of the demilitarised area except in general terms,I said that the form in which Monsieur Faure had phrased itwould have created alarm and despondency among the N.A.T.O0Powers,    I added that I agreed and that we had to be careful not to propound precise boundaries at this stage or we shouldbe held to anything we offered,    I thought the really importantissue at this Conference was Germany,    I hoped that he and Iwould press together strongly to try to move the Russians onthis.    The President cordially agreed.A.E.17th July. 1955
When I was alone with the President this afternoon we had discussions at some length on the Far Eastern situation.    I told him that I thought that there was no immediate danger of war in Europe.The President agreed.    On the other hand I was deeply concerned at theposition in the Far East, especially in respect of the off-shore islands cfQuemoy and Matsus.    Whatever view the Presidents advisers mighthave about Nehru it was the fact that the Indians had worked hard to persuade the Chinese to moderate their attitude.    The Presidentindicated that he thought this might well be so in respect of Nehru, butmade it plain that he had not much use for Krishna Menon&apos;s methods,,He thought that the latter concealed intellectual arrogance under thecloak of humility.    I said that as I had explained to Mr. Dulles in timesgone by one had to look at the problem of the off-shore islands as Pekingmight see it.    If I was Chou en-Lai I should not wish to see the americans out of Quemoy and Matsus.    1 should say to myself that aslong as the Americans were there they were to some extent at my mercy0I could put them in a dilemma at any time.    If I take or threaten totake Quemoy and Matsus I know the Americans will have to come to the help of Chiang kai-Shek, in which event they would not be supported byworld opinion, or they will have to leave him to his fate which would bea blow to their authority,.    Therefore, speaking from our point of view,it seemed to me that the United States would be much better placed inevery way both locally and before world opinion if Chiang kai-Shek&apos;s forces were withdrawn from Quemoy and Matsus.2.       The President said that he did not dispute this at all.    No subject had given him more concern and he only wished he could see a clear way through the difficulties.    They were however   very real.    He had to face the fact that he must count on Chiang kai-Shek to defend Formosa.Chiang kai-Shek encouraged by the Americans at the time of the Korean,war had built up strong forces in Quemoy and Matsus.    He had tried to persuade him to at least reduce these forces to relatively weak outpostswhich could inflict loss on the enemy if attacked and could then havebeen withdrawn without disaster to Chiang kai-Shek&apos;s prestige.    However-Chiang had not been willing to do this.    The President had sent a mission over to Formosa to try to persuade him but he did not think thatthe mission had done its task very well.    At any rate it had not succeededoHe had even considered the possibility of inviting Chiang to washington and trying to see what he could do himself.    He felt the difficulty of thisalso,    I said I understood his hesitation about inviting Chiang to washington a&quot;s such an event would certainly have wide publicity, with perhaps some unhelpful repercussions,    I thought that Chiang probablydid not want to accept the Presidents advice because, among other thingsvhe would not be sorry to see the United States embroiled with CommunistChina0    The President said that there was still the problem of thedefence of Formosa.    The United States owed Chiang kai-Shek nothing but he was necessary to the defence of Formosa.    When I mentioned that&apos;I understood the Formosans themselves were not sympathetic tothe Communists, the President said that this was true but if onceChiang kai-Shek disappeared there might not be much as an alternative to Peking.
30       We continued to discuss the topic for a considerable time andthe President repeatedly assured me of his concern about the positionand his anxiety to be quit of the islands if he could contrive it.    Atone point he said that if he could put them under the sea he would gladlydo so.    I said that my own impression was that Chiang kai-Shek*withdrawal from Quemoy and Matsus would have no adverse effect on either his authority or that of the United States in the Far East.    Thesame would not be true of course of a withdrawal under pressure fromFormosa.    The President said this might be right and that he was glad of our talk together on this difficult subject.    I said that I had raised itbecause it seemed the one issue on which our two countries could soeasily be divided and he would know how sincerely anxious I was toavoid anything so dangerous.    The President agreed and said that hisrelations with Great Britain were quite exceptional.    No other country was in the same position except his neighbour Canada,    The Presidentasked me to give him an opportunity of thinking over what I had said and to talk to Mr. Dulles about it who he assured me was also muchmore concerned on this matter than the public generally thoughto&apos;   after that he would certainly wish for another opportunity for us to talktogether on the matter while he was still in Geneva,A.E.17th July. 1955
A.E.\19th July, 1955.In the course of our talk at dinner tonight I remarked to marshal Bulganin that though the situation in Europe was difficultit was not dangerous.    He cordially agreed and added that thepossibility of war in Europe was so far away it was hardly worthtalking about.    He agreed however that the Far Eastern situation was much more anxious.    He spoke of Formosa and the dangers there,,I said that Quemoy and Matsus worried me much more.    Krushchevinterjected here that the Chinese had been very patient.    He did notthink that the&apos;Russians would have been so patient,    I replied that heunderestimated his own statesmanship.    The position of Quemoy andMatsus was very difficult for the Americans and for everybodyconcerned.    The Americans might wish Chiang Kai-shek to reducehis forces on the islands.    It did not follow from that that they couldcompel him to do so.    We were not always able to get our friends todo what we wished.    The Russians appeared to accept this but theywere clearly still anxious about the Far Eastern situation.    TheForeign Secretary suggested that the Americans would be very happyif Quemoy and Matsus were sunk under the sea.    This suggestionappeared to receive universal approbation except, possibly, we alladmitted from an absent Chou En-Lai.    The Russians commentedthe master of the house is absent.
GERMANYMarshal Bulganin and Krushchev, with Molotov, Zhukov andMalik, came to dinner with the Foreign Secretary and myself tonightsDuring dinner I sat between Bulganin and Krushchev and had a frankand intimate talk with the former, who appeared to wish to give a clear account of his genuine preoccupations.    After some preliminarytalk about the war years, Bulganin plunged into the problem of Germany.He explained on familiar lines how real were Soviet fears of a Germanrecovery.    Almost every family in Soviet Russia, including his own,had suffered some personal loss0    I replied that we in Britain had also no reason to feel tenderly to the Germans after the experienceof two wars.    But one had to look to the future and whatever the fear of Germany had been, I could not believe that in this nuclearage Germany could really be a formidable danger to Russia,Bulganin however would not altogether accept this.    He admitted thatGermany might not be able to make hydrogen bombs, but after all they could be given to them.    We had some talk about these new weapons and their possible consequences for the world.    Bulganinhowever maintained that the problem was for the present, and wouldbe for some time to come, one which only concerned the United States^Russia and ourselves.    He did not foresee a future when the smallerPowers would be able to make the bomb.    I argued that whatever theSoviet fears of Germany, we were all agreed that some time germany must be united and my suggestions had been based on a desire to meetwhat I well understood to be Russian fears.    Bulganin said he thoughtthat some of our suggestions were important and more than once inour conversation emphasised the part that we would have to play in trying to find a solution.    We discussed the possibility of reachingsome agreement about forces and armaments in Germany andneighbouring countries and some form of supervision to control it.He thought this worth examining, but said that he had not thoughtabout it,    I advised him to give it consideration.    We also discusseda Security Pact and I told him I thought it a pretty hopeless propositionto try to create a Pact for all Europe.    How for instance could Titoand Franco be accommodated together ?    He laughed and said that perhaps this was not necessary; maybe the Soviets cast their netstoo wide,    Ferhaps it would be possible to form some Pact between us which covered at least a part of Europe.2.       In later discussion, when Krushchev was present, thesuggestion was the N.A.T.O. Powers maintaining their organisation andthe Warsaw Powers maintaining theirs, and that all these should join the European Pact with the addition of some other countries.    Theygladly accepted that this should include the United States and Canada,,39       After we had discussed these matters for some time,Bulganin said that he wanted to say something to me which he had saidto nobody else.    It was really not possible for his Government toreturn to Moscow from this Conference having agreed to the immediateunification of Germany,    They were a united Government and reasonablysolidly based in the country but this was something that Russia wouldnot accept and if they were to agree to it, neither the Army nor thepeople would understand it and this was no time to weaken theGovernment.    The people would say this was something Stalin would never have agreed to0    On this therefore he simply could not meet usc
i\)04.        In further discussion with him, and later with Krushchev,it emerged that while they could not agree to the unification of Germanynow, they might be prepared to consider terms of reference for theForeign Secretaries, which would contemplate such unification togetherwith other compensating conditions.    At Bulganin&apos;s request I repeatedafter dinner to Krushchev the kind of directive I hoped we might givethe Foreign Secretaries,,    This would consist oi.%&quot;(1)   an instruction to study the unification ofGermany, having regard to the securityof all concerned;(2)   study of a security pact for Europe, or apart of itj(3)   study of the limitation of forces and arma-ments in Germany and in the countriesneighbouring Germany,      and(4)   study of the possibility of creating ademilitarised area.Both Bulganin and Krushchev appeared to agree that such terms ofreference were acceptable ones for the Foreign Secretaries, but they said it would be necessary to draft and study them.    Molotov being present by this time, I suggested that as an expert draughtsman heshould try his hand at the task.5.        In a long experience of talks with Russians, I think that thiswas the most important and certainly the frankest conversation that Ihave known.    I have not thought it useful to repeat the many compli-ments to Britain and references to a personal part in relations in years gone by.    All this could properly be ascribed to a desire to divide us from the Americans.    But I do not think that this would be acomplete explanation.    It is rather my impression that they regardus as the only possible bridge between themselves and the UnitedStates and that they are anxious that this bridge should be built.    TheFrench were never mentioned, the United States were always referredto with respect, and as being our friends - from whom we should notbe divided.    Each time I mentioned Canada, her position was immediately accepted,,    Nehru&apos;s visit was frequently mentioned with satisfaction.A.E.
U121.   THE WORK OF THE CONFERENCE,     2.  palestine the Foreign Secretary and I had breakfast with the Presidentthis morning, when Mr. Dulles and Mr. Dillon Anderson were also present,   &quot;I began by giving the President at his request an account ofour discussion with the Russians at dinner last night.    He seemedencouraged by the progress we had made and repeated this as I wassaying good-bye to him an hour and a half later.2.        Our talk dealt almost entirely with the work of the Conferenceand the President showed himself much more keen to get positiveresults.    After canvassing various possibilities we agreed that some immediate agreement to apply supervision to the forces of East and west in a part of Europe would be the best tangible result we could hope for.    The president suggested that there might for instance be such joint inspection to a depth of 100 miles or so on either side ofour existing line in Germany.    I suggested that it would be good toget General Gruenther&apos;s view of all this and the President thought thisan excellent idea and is sending for him and I understand forAdmiral Radford as well.3.        We also agreed that at luncheon today he would pressZhukov on the importance of some concrete result emerging fromthe Conference and that I would take the same line with Bulganin,with whom I am to lunch.4.        In general the President showed himself impressed by thechange in climate which he really believes has come over Soviet opinion.We both agreed however that an agreement to immediate action inrespect of the unity of Germany was nc?b to be got here.    It might wellbe beyond the power of the Soviet rulers to come so far so soon afterthe agreement on Austria and visit to Yugoslavia and making a gestureof friendliness to Western Germany,5.       At the conclusion of our discussion we spoke for a few minutesabout Alpha and impressed on our American friends the importance ofgiving Nuri some tangible indication of our friendship and our desireto help him in the form of the tanks which he had so long been waiting for.    A separate telegram is being sent about this.6. We are to renew our 8.30 breakfast tomorrow in order todiscuss Far Eastern affairs, which we had no time to reach today.A.E..20th July, 19550
If) 4THE FAR EASTAt the Presidents suggestion Mr. Foster Dulles accompaniedby Mre Phleger came to breakfast this morning with the foreign secretary and myself in order to discuss the Far Eastern situation.The outcome was not encouraging.    Mr. Dulles went once again overthe old ground saying that the Chinese Communists were impatient;why did they alone of the nations recently embroiled expect to haveeverything come right for them at once ?    Korea was still divided,so was Germany.    Why should the Chinese Communists expect tohave everything rounded off for them at once ?   He referred to theOffshore Islands.    I said amongst other things they were in a positionto round those off for themselves.    They had the power to do it.Mr. Dulles said he supposed that was true.    At the same time if onlythe Chinese would act reasonably for a year or two they would find thewhole climate of world opinion changed and their admission to theUnited Nations for instance would certainly take place.    I explainedthat being a revolutionary power and waiting for a year or two mightnot greatly appeal to them.    The Foreign Secretary then asked whatwould in fact happen if the Chinese did act in the manner I had suggestedthey could.    Mr. Dulles said that he could not tell but if we wantedhis guess it was this.    If Quemoy and Matsus were attacked and thewhole thing was over in a short time, say in a day or two, there wouldprobably be no reaction in the United States.    It was certainly notthe UeS. Governments intention to act at once.    If on the other hand the fighting was protracted and for instance a gallant resistance was put up by Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s men as at Dien Bien Phu, the demand forintervention in the United States would be very strong and his own view was that as a result the United States would act.    I wouldremember how at the time of Dien Bien Phu the pressure then of american public opinion for action had been strong and Indo-China was more remote.    I said the value of the intervention was also considerably in doubt, which he accepted.    I said that the situation he put before us was a very dangerous one.    It seemed terrible that a war might dependon how long Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s men held out on these islands, for weunderstood the difficulty of American military intervention there0Mr. Dulles said that the position was undoubtedly highly dangerous andwe might be said to be living over a volcano.    On the other hand theUnited States Government had done everything possible to persuadeChiang Kai-shek to get out of the Offshore Islands and he would not.They had sent Admiral Radford and Mr, Robertson on a special-rnission0They had used every possible argument and they had failed,,       Afterthe meeting had broken and as I was escorting Mr. Dulles to his carhe said that he begged me to believe that the Americans had doneeverything they possibly could to persuade Chiang but that he wasimmovable. J7    * said that I had been very much struck by something which the President had said to me at our last talk$ namely that the dangers could be very much decreased and the military position ofChiang strengthened if instead of holding these Onshore Islands with50,000 men or whatever the number now was he held them merely asan outpost.    He could mine them and make them unpleasant to take inany other way he liked, but if he held them as an outpost and the chinese communists did attack, Chiang&apos;s prestige would not be involved, and still less that of the United States.    This seemed to me to makepolitical and military sense because the weakness of the present position was that Chou-En-lai by attacking could face the United States with anappaHing dilemma, either to intervene for their friends with consequencesno-one could foresee, or to leave their friends to their fate before the
worlde    Mr. Dulles said that the President had spoken to him about hisoutpost idea and he knew that he was very keen on it but so far he hadnot been able to sell it either to the Chiefs of Staff or to Chiang Kai-shek,I said that nonetheless it seemed to me to make sense.20        I asked Mr, Dulles if he thought we could do anything in thecircumstances with the situation so dangerous.    I thought I wouldtake the opportunity tonight when dining with the Russians to speak tothem about that danger.    Mr. Dulles said yes, he hoped that I wouldand that should aid things with Chou En-lai.    Probably we could not do very much ourselves, but our Asiatic friends should do all theycould to persuade Chou En-lai to wait.    I said that was just exactly what they had been doing and I thought that was why the position hadbeen quiet but I doubted very much if it would be held in that wayindefinitely.    Mr. Dulles said we must just try to carry the babyalongo    In time the matter would solve itself.    Already in Formosathe army was changing character.    It was being more and morecomposed of young Formosans who did not want to return to the mainland and if that developed the Offshore Islands would matterless and in another two or three years something might happen tomake that position soluble.    In the meanwhile, by the talks they had proposed at Geneva the Americans hoped some arrangements couldbe arrived at which would be helpful not only about the prisoners butperhaps also about restraint on attacks on shipping and other arrange-ments of that kind which would reduce the danger of incidents.A.E.22nd July, 1955.\
A.E.23rd July? 19550After the dinner given by the Soviet Delegation on 22nd July1 had some conversation with MM, Bulganin and Khrushchev about theFar East.    Marshal Zhukov was also present, but took no part in this conversation.    MM4 Bulganin and Khrushchev said that they had been,greatly impressed by what they had seen during their visit to China0The new leaders there were men to be reckoned with.    BothMao tse-Tung and Chou En-lai were strong characters, but men ofbalanced judgment who were unlikely to take hasty or ill-consideredaction.    The regime was firmly established;  much material progress was being made; and in ten years or so China would be a strong modemState.2.      Meanwhile, their revolution was young.    It was naturaltherefore that they should resent Chiang*soccupation of Quemoy andthe Matsus so near their coast-line, and United States protection ofChiang in Formosa.    It was natural, too, that they should wish to takeChina1 s seat in the United Nations.    On that point they certainly hadright on their side.3.       I said that President Eisenhower was doing his best to keephis public opinion under control on the subject of Quemoy and theMatsus.    The Russians should, however, recognise his difficulties.This was a subject on which emotions ran high in the United States.Our own interests in China had been mainly commercial: we hadtraded there for a long time, and over the years had earned a goodcommercial return for what we had invested.    But the Americans,during the war and since, had poured money into China; and theaverage American now felt that the Chinese had bitten the hand thatfed them.    As a result the Americans were specially sensitive aboutthe present situation.    The President was doing his best, in spite ofthis, to calm things down and to counsel patience.    If he were givenmore time, all might yet be well.    Were the Chinese prepared to be equally patient?40       M. Khrushchev said that traditionally the Chinese were apatient people.    He believed that they would not take any rash action at the present time.    It was to be hoped, however, that some fruitfulresult would come from the meetings which were to be held in Genevabetween the Ambassadors of the United States and China.5B      I said that these discussions should help.    Though theywould begin with such questions as release of prisoners, they mightwell broaden out to cover some of the more substantial issues.
