secret.P.(55) 74COPY NO.   6 513th July, 1955CABINETJAPANESE WAR criminals memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsPROBLEM    &quot;Recent developments have made it desirable to review ourpresent policy towards Japanese war criminals.BACKGROUND(i)    Major or Class &quot;A&quot; criminals.    These were convicted andsentenced by the International Military Tribunal for theFar East.    The power to exercise clemency is vested inthe eight powers represented on the Tribunal who subsequentlyratified the Japanese Peace Treaty, namely the United Kingdom,the U.S.A., Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Netherlands,France and Pakistan.    These Powers can take decisions by majority vote, but they have always hitherto actedunanimously and it has been our desire that they should doso.    There are at present 7 major war criminals still in prison, all of whom were condemned to life imprisonment,and 5 who are out of prison on special medical parole.(ii)    Minor or Class &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; criminals.      These wereconvicted by British courts and Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentexercise jurisdiction over them.    There were 81 of thesemen in gaol on 1st July, 1955.    Annexed is a statement ofthe number of &quot;minor&quot; war criminals tried and convictedby British military courts, together, with an account of therate at which their numbers will be reduced by expiry of sentence.    The last prisoners will not be due for releaseuntil I960 in spite of the fact that we have reduced the&quot;quantum&quot; of life imprisonment to 20 years.Major war criminals3. There has been pressure for some time from the Japanese/and other Powers for the exercise of a greater  degree of clemencytowards these men.    We have wished to follow the policy of reviewingeach case on its r.:erits with a view to seeing whether the exercise ofclemency is justified.    The representatives of the other nations concerned,however, have not accepted any of our proposals for reduction of sentences; they wish to see a more general measure of clemency.2.There are two sets of Japanese war criminals:-&quot;
mo4. The United States Government have now suggested formallythat all major war criminals should be released on parole after they have spent 10 years in gaol.    The French and Pakistan Governments stronglysupport the United States position.    The Canadian Government are on thewhole in favour of early release but would support any proposal whichcould be approved by a majority of the Powers concerned.    &quot;We have knownfor some time that this was the position of these Governirients, but thebalance has now been swung by the fact that the New Zealand Governmenthave come out in support of the United States proposal and are urging itupon other members of the Commonwealth.    The Australian Governmenthave also just decided that they should exercise a considerable degree ofclemency towards minor war criminals - see below - and that so far asmajor war criminals were concerned they would accept any arrangementacceptable to the majority of other countries concerned provided thismajority included all the interested members of the Commonwealth.Only the Netherlands Government have expressed no particular viewthough their position has generally tended to be closer to ours than tothe Americans.    But whatever the Netherlands&apos; view may be there arenow 6 Governments out of the 8 concerned who are evidently ready toparole war criminals after 10 years.5. We know the Japanese attach the highest importance to therelease of war criminals.    Mr. Shigemitsu, the Foreign Minister whowas himself convicted of being a war criminals naturally feels particularlystrongly, but national feeling on the subject appears to be united.    if nothing further is done about these men shortly, there is a danger thatthey will become martyrs in the eyes of the Japanese and the beneficialeffects of their condemnation may be lost.6. These decisions by the other Powers have put us in an isolated and dangerous position.    If we were to resist the release of the major war criminals we should be over-ruled by the majority, but the japanese would learn of our attitude and this could only damage Anglo-japanese relations.    On the other hand a decision in favour of greater clemencywould have a good effect on the Japanese and might help to show up theRussians in the present Soviet/Japanese negotiations.    In the circum-stances I consider that we should fall in with the views of the other powers concerned and release the major war criminals after they have spent 10years in gaol.    This would permit the majority of the major war criminalsto be released in September or December of this year and the last one would come out next April.    I do not think there would be any point inreleasing these men on parole since a parole system would almost certainly be unenforceable.    It would be better that the men should be released out-right.    I have instructed H.M. Ambassador accordingly to propose this tothe representatives of the other Powers concerned, but if they insist onparole he is authorised to concur with their views.Minor war criminals7. Here, too, we have followed the policy of reviewing each caseon its merits to see whether clemency is justifiable.    This process hasresulted in a number of reductions of sentence, but it is slow and has not made an appreciable difference to the majority of sentences.    In thesecases also recent decisions by the other Powers who control war criminalshave left us isolated.    The United States Government already regax*d theirminor war criminals as eligible for parole after 10 years.    The french have released all their criminals, as have also the Philippine Government.Even the Australian Government who have to reckon with a sensitive public
inopinion towards the Japanese, now propose to release on parole all the minor war criminals held under their jurisdiction after they have servedone-third of their sentence or a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.If we were to maintain our policy on minor war criminals we should notbe able to hide behind the decisions of other Powers as in the case&quot; of major war criminals and we should appear to be more bitter andunforgiving than other nations.    This could do us no good.    TheJapanese feel as strongly about minor war criminals as about the -\:.ajorand of course there are many more of them involved.    A decision toexercise greater clemency over these minor war criminals in such a manner as to permit the problem to be settled at an early date could onlybenefit Anglo-Japanese relations which may otherwise be embittered bythis issue for years to come.    In the circumstances I think we should adopt the same policy towards minor as towards major criminals andrelease them after they have spent 10 years in gaol.    Moreover, if weare to release these men we should take as much credit as we can for doing so and should arrange that our decision be made public.POINT TO BE DECIDED8. As regards the minor war criminals I ask my colleagues to agree that I should make a Submission to The Queen that those whohave been sentenced to more than 15 years should have their sentencesreduced to 15 years, which, with one-third reduction for good conduct,would enable them to be released after 10 years.    The commonwealth and other Governments would be informed of the action we propose totake.    After The Queen has approved the Submission I would make anannouncement of our policy in response to a Parliamentary Question.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1.13th July, 1955.J
