(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 60 COPY NO. C? *-f2nd July, 1955CABINETAPPLICATION FOR A PASSPORT BY MRS. NUNN MAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe wife of Dr. Alan Nunn May applied in May for a passportto travel to Austria on&quot; holiday with her infant son.    A passport has notyet been issued and she has not pursued the matter.2.        Mrs. Nunn May, who is of German birth, was formerly marriedto an Austrian Communist and was herself a member of the Communistparty in Austria.    Although she may genuinely wish only to revisit friends in Austria, we cannot exclude the possibility that her real intention is toreclaim Austrian nationality and remain in that country in the hope that dr. Nunn May may be permitted to join her on compassionate grounds.From Austria they could both defect to an Iron Curtain country without difficulty.3.        Dr. Nunn May has applied for a passport three times since his release from prison.    His applications have been refused because if hedefected there would be an outcry in the Press both here and in the U.S.A. ,which would prejudice Anglo-American relations generally, and inparticular the negotiations fOr the United Kingdom/United States civil andmilitary agreements on atomic information (Cmd. 9507-8).    Neither Dr.nor Mrs. Nunh May is believed to possess information of any value to theRussians and no security factor is, therefore, involved.4.        The then Foreign Secretary, in refusing a passport to Dr. Nunn May,was exercising a discretion based on precedent in respect of the very rarecases where the activities of an individual were so notoriously undesirableor dangerous that Parliament could be expected to uphold his action.The Cabinet endorsed this view on 30th December, 1952 (C.C.(52) 100thConclusions, Minute 6) and further agreed on 18th December, 1953 (C.C.(53)80th Conclusions, Minute 8) that the Home Secretary should, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour, do his best to ensure that Dr0 Nunn Mayremained in the United Kingdom.5.        It is very doubtful whether Mrs. Nunn May&apos;s relationship to dr.&apos;Nunn May and her Communist antecedents bring her within the category of persons in respect of whom there are precedents for refusing a passport,A visit by Airs. Nunn May to Austria might, however, receive publicity inthe Press which in turn might affect the attitude of Congress towards theAnglo-United States Atomic Energy Agreements which were signed on15th June and are now before Congress for a period of 30 days.
6.        There appear to be three courses open:-(i) to grant the passport forthwith;(ii) to grant it only after Congress has approved the Atomic Energy Agreements;(iii) to refuse it altogether.I regard this as a delicate and a very open question.I should welcome my colleagues&apos; opinion as to which ofthese three courses is to be pursued.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1.1st July, 1955.
