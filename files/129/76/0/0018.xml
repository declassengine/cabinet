Comparison between forecasts in P (55) 18 and the present report
Note by the Chairman of the committee this is the first report of a new Committee set up to replace the oldProgrammes Committee. Historically the report of that Committee was designedto present to Ministers recommendations about the level of departmental import programmes under conditions of State trading. The balance of payments analysiswas background information against which Ministers took their decisions. Thedepartmental-controlled programmes are now relatively insignificant and it was felt that Ministers now needed an analysis of the balance of payments positionand prospects against the background of which they could take major decisions ofeconomic policy in both the external and internal fields.2. This report takes account not only of assessments made by Departments,in the light of their contacts with industry, of what exports and imports are likelyto be; it also takes more account than has hitherto been possible of the general development and prospect of the economy as a whole on the one hand and of current developments in the exchange markets and world economic prospects onthe other. This will result in reports for Ministers which are more broadly based,and the figures in this report should, therefore, be viewed as indications of trendsunder existing policies.(Signed)        A. W. FRANCE.22nd June, 1955.
COMMITTEE ON BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROSPECTSREPORT-JUNE 1955Introductory1. On this occasion we examine the year 1954-55 (July to June) and theprospects for 1955-56. For purposes of comparison we also give the figures for1953-54. This is convenient because it shows how our position deteriorated duringthe second half of 1954 and smoothes over the artificial disturbance of the dockstrike last autumn, which postponed till 1955 transactions which would otherwise have taken place in 1954. But for the first half of 1956 the basis for forecastingis extremely thin, and the figures now tentatively put forward for 1955-56 arebest thought of as a summary presentation of the trend which we think eventsmay take in the second half of 1955.C)Table current Balances and Changes in United Kingdom Monetary Assets and liabilities 1953-54 to 1955-56  millionUnited Kingdom current balance (includingDefence Aid)       ...      .........Sterling Area balance with non-sterlingworld: United  Kingdom  current  balance(including Aid)    .........R.S.A. surplus*       .........Total (surplus -f, deficit -)Change in United Kingdom Monetary assets and Liabilitiesf with non-sterling, world(improvement     deterioration -)of which Gold and dollar reserves (rise -f-,fall -)       ............1953-54+3001954-55(forecast)+ 501955-56(forecast)-I- 50+200+250+250+230-250+100-150-100/150-120$(- 40)-200+100-100Seeparagraph 15andAnnex I(paragraphs39-42)* Including official assistance.f Gold and dollar reserves and official holdings of non-dollar currencies, less sterling liabilitiesand the\debit balance in E.P.U.% The figure includes the  80 million special repayments in the second half of 1954  40 millioneach to I.M.F. and bilateral payments in reduction of E.P.U. debits. The figure in brackets excludesthem.The year 1954-552. The year 1953-54 was a favourable period in every respect; and yet theUnited Kingdom current balance was the sort of outturn we need it to be if weare to carry out our commitments and our responsibilities, especially the financing of development in the Commonwealth. The United Kingdom had an overallcurrent balance exceeding  300 million, within which was a substantial favourable balance with the non-sterling world. Together with a non-sterling surplus of over 200 million earned by the R.S.A. this led to a  250 million Sterling Areanon-sterling surplus: sterling was very strong and. the reserves rose by  230 million.3. In its last report (P. (55) 18) in February, the Programmes Committeecommented on the position up to the end of 1954, but the deterioration in 1954-55compared with 1953-54 can now be seen in better perspective than it could inFebruary.j i1) Throughout this report we have rounded the figures, more drastically in the main reportwhere we are dealing with the broad trends and less drastically in relation to specific subjects in the annexes. Owing to this figures in tables do not always add up and figures quoted do not alwaysagree in every detail.48250 B 2

In the United Kingdom, the comparative stagnation of exports in themiddle of 1954, which owing to the dock strike continued in the late autumn, now appears more as part of a seasonal pattern superimposed on an increase of5 per cent, or  140 million for the year which was already in progress. Imports,on the other hand, have increased (beginning only late in the autumn of 1954) by 300 million. A 6 per cent, increase in volume accounted for only  180 million of this: import prices were rising and the Board of Trade index reached a peak of 105 in February and then fell back slightly the terms of trade are shown inTable 3. There has also been a serious deterioration in invisibles (Annex I,Table 8), the net oil credit falling by  50 million (owing partly to a non-recurrentchange in the tax arrangements) and Government overseas expenditure (net) risingby  40 million.5. For the Sterling Area as a whole the position is very much worse; the deterioration in the United Kingdom current balance is solely with the non-sterlingworld ( 300 million), while the R.S.A. non-sterling surplus falls by  100 million.Thus the non-sterling position of the Sterling Area as a whole is a deficit of  150million in place of a surplus of  250 million. The effects of this on the positionof sterling and the reserves have been greatly moderated by a heavy inflowof short-term capital in the second half of 1954.6. The worsening of the payments position which started in the fourth quarterof 1954 was reflected in the movement of the reserves and exchanges. Thepayments deficit led to there being too much sterling in the hands of foreigners.This, combined probably with a view that the full convertibility of sterling wasnot imminent, caused the rate for sterling on transferable account to fall to apoint at which a variety of transactions became profitable, all of which tended to divert dollars away from us. Among them were increased buying of dollar goods for sale for sterling (where that is allowed) and the &quot; shunting &quot; of Sterling Areacommodities via non-dollar markets, which meant a loss of business to UnitedKingdom merchants who were not free to use the cheaper transferable sterling.7. The deterioration gathered speed early in 1955, so that instead of a seasonalstrengthening of the reserves and exchanges there was a weakening, particularlyin February. On 24th February action was taken to tighten credit and to authoriseintervention in the market for transferable sterling with a view to bringing therate to a point close to the official rate at which the transactions which have been described were no longer profitable. The Governments policy had marked effect
on confidence abroad and the rate for transferable sterling was brought closer to the official rate (which itself appreciated) with only moderate intervention bythe authorities.8. Throughout 1954 the balance of payments was considerably relieved bythe running down of recorded stocks of imported commodities, partly because ofthe change-over from Government to private trading, and it is not thought that other stocks of raw and partly-processed materials were increasing faster than was required by the increase in production. The very high imports in the first quartersuggest, however, that the normal seasonal fall of stocks did not take place, andit may have been partly as a result of the Governments measures that imports fellback heavily in April and May (a change which is fully allowed for in our figures).9. But the main object of the measures announced on 24th February was togive relief to the balance of payments by limiting internal demand through theincrease of Bank Rate to 4% per cent, and the imposition of hire purchase restric-tions. As a monetary measure the increase in Bank Rate, with its consequentialeffects on other market rates, may be expected to operate not only through the checkimposed by higher rates themselves but also through the effect on credit resultingfrom the pressure on.bankers&apos; liquidity. While it would be wrong to attribute to thehigher Bank Rate all the movements in the banking figures which have occurred since the rate was raised there has, for example, been an important seasonalreduction in the short-term financing of the national expenditures the influence of the tighter monetary conditions is to be seen in the fall in deposits betweenFebruary and May of  153 million this year compared with a rise of  97 million in the same period of 1954. So far this contraction in deposits has been accompanied by a reduction in bankers&apos; investments rather than in advances, whichhave in fact been rising though probably by less than they would have risen ifBank Rate had not been increased. The restrictions on hire purchase are intendedto curb a form of purchasing power not readily responsive to the interest rate,and will be supported by the stop on additional hire purchase finance from banksand other sources of capital. There has been some contraction in the furnituretrade; but it is still too early to judge the extent to which in general the restrictionsso far imposed have had a real effect.10. It was to be expected, however, that more fundamental reactions, andthe slowing up in the rate of expansion of activity which the situation required,would take longer to show themselves. The effects of higher rates have shown themselves in the monetary system but it is not clear that tighter credit has as yetdone more than curb the rate at which the economy might otherwise have beenexpanding. Despite lower gilt-edged prices the Stock Exchange is optimistic and indeed the index of industrial ordinary shares is daily reaching new peaks. Again,before the strikes, unemployment (some 220,000) was still falling while the numberof vacancies to be filled (some 420,000) was steadily rising. None of this suggestsa condition in which industrialists are having to look for new export outlets, orsufficient labour is available to move where it is most needed.11. It may well be that the growing influence of the tighter credit policyis now about to make its impact felt upon the economy as a whole. It is beyond our scope to judge of this, or the speed and depth with which its effects, once felt,will spread. It is the major &quot; unknown &quot; which might alter the trend presented in our forecasts.The Year 1955-5612. The assumptions we. have made in looking at developments in 1955-56are in line with the Chancellors Budget judgment and take account of the taxconcessions. They are set out in Annex I, in which we also comment more fullyon the trends expected in the various groups of transactions which make up thebalance of payments, and deal with a number of specific factors to which attentionmay be called.13. On these assumptions and subject to the very important qualificationsin the next section of the report, we expect some further deterioration in the overallcurrent balance of the United Kingdom in 1955-56 compared with 1954-55. Butthe figures for 1954-55 include a satisfactory first quarter and three unsatisfactoryquarters.   Thus, within the broad margins of error of such calculations, the
indications are rather in the sense of &quot; no change &quot; from the recent position than of any further deterioration. There is little change for the year as a whole inthe rate of expansion of exports (5 per cent.) or of the volume of imports (6 percent.). The improved trade figures for April and May, which follow a very badfirst quarter, are in keeping with our forecasts. Our assumptions imply aboutthe same import prices as the average for 1954-55. It is impossible to forecast the course of world prices, but the assumptions about the terms of trade we have adopted (Table 3 below) are the best we can make.Table 3United Kingdom Terms of Trade(1954=100)1953-54                1954-55 1955-562nd        1st          2nd       1st 2nd       1sthalf      half         half     half* half*     half*1953     1954        1954      1955 1955     1956(Board of Trade Index)    (forecast) (assumed)Prices of imports c.i.f.   ...       100        99          101       105 103       103Prices of exports f.o.b.   ...       101       100          100       101 101       101Terms of trade    ......         99        99          101       104 102       102* The indices for these periods are based on the average prices during each period taken as awhole. They are therefore not strictly comparable with the Board of Trade index which is an averageof prices in each month of the period, and not of the period as a whole.14. The whole deterioration in the United Kingdom current balance in1955-56 is with the Sterling Area; this takes the impact of the Australian importcuts, while there is a reduction of the net oil credit (and exchange surplus) in theR.S.A.,(2) which is offset by an improvement in the non-sterling world. The current balance with the non-sterling world may actually improve a little; there is animprovement in special receipts (offshore purchases, &amp;c.) from the United Statesand Canada which is roughly equal to the fall in Defence Aid. A small improve-ment in the R.S.A. non-sterling surplus is also possible. The Colonies non-sterlingsurplus is likely to turn into a small deficit, and they are expected to increase theiroverall current deficit to about  80 million, though this deficit would still beoutweighed by an inflow of capital (see Annex I, paragraph 35).15. Thus for the Sterling Area as a whole the trends suggest a deficit of about 100 million compared with  150 million in 1954-55. But given our margins of error, we regard this as a check to the deterioration rather than a definite turnfor the better; we have already explained how uncertain the data for assessing1956 must be. Moreover, the second half of the year is seasonally bad; and in1955 it follows on a poor first half year and may precede another. (Figures forthe calendar year 1955 are given in Annex II, along with the changes since thelast report of the Programmes Committee both for 1954-55 and for the year1955.)16. Thus the second half of 1955 could have serious dangers for the positionof sterling and the reserves. We have drawn attention to the large short-timecapital inflow which limited the fall in the reserves in the second half of 1954.We cannot rely on this being repeated in 1955-56. Accordingly we think that ourfigures suggest a fall in the reserves in 1955-56 of probably more than  100 million;and, given the seasonal improvement to be expected in the first half of 1956,the fall in the second half of 1955 might be nearer  150 million, of which about half would occur on 31st December when the United States and Canadian loan charges are met. The fall in the reserves could be considerably less than this if themeasures adopted to correct the situation were manifestly adequate and successful.Indeed, if this were not apparent the fall might well be greater by reason of a lossof confidence in sterling.(2) It may be expected that large sums accruing to the Middle East oil countries will be held intheir sterling balances (Annex I, paragraph 36) for the time being. This will relieve the immediateposition, though it will have its dangers for the future.
Certain major uncertainties in the figures for 1955-5617. There are, however, three important qualifications to be made. Theserelate to:  (a) Wage claims;(b) Strikes;(c) The measures to restrict credit,18. The figures used in this report, being necessarily based on calculations putin hand some weeks ago, make allowance for only moderate increases in wages afterthose agreed in March. Those agreed in April are at an annual rate of  50 million;this was somewhat unexpected, and if this tendency continues it will, on the onehand, make a substantial addition to purchasing power at home, so increasing the pressures, and on the other worsen our competitive position abroad.19. The strikes could have a considerable effect on the balance of payments,especially if prolonged, when the effect will become progressively more serious.Apart altogether from the effect on confidence abroad, and so on short-term capital movements and the exchange rates, the dislocation will lead to loss ofproduction. Imports which do not come during the dock strike will for the mostpart be made up afterwards; but some of the exports will be lost for good and withthem, perhaps, continuing markets. This is the second time within a year thatdeliveries to overseas customers have been interrupted. The liner strike will loseus tourist earnings. But none of this can be put into figures. The first signs are that the effect of the railway strike may be less than might have been expected andthat the dock strike will have a more serious impact.20. While in respect of both the wage increases and the strikes the positionwe suggest in this report may prove to have been optimistic, measures to restrictcredit could cause a markedly better outturn. If the monetary measures already taken, together if necessary with some tightening up and the use of other measures affecting general demand, succeed in slowing up the rate of expansion there wouldbe real improvement. Some industries would then find the home markets lessattractive and be impelled to look for additional exports, while industries withgrowing export opportunities could attract labour and materials more easily fromothers less well placed. The changes take time but once business men realised thatthis slowing up was really going to happen, there might be immediate relief to thebalance of payments from reductions in stocks of materials, work in progress and finished goods as distinct from the check to increases which, as we indicate inparagraph 8, may already have taken place. These stocks are put, in the economy as a whole, at  7,500 million, so that a small proportionate reduction could givesubstantial relief to the balance of payments.21. We are quite unable to judge how deeply the measures of 24th February,discussed in paragraphs 9-11, will bite; still less whether intensification is neededor would,be acceptable. It is not possible to assess, until there has been some experience,xhow big a correction can be applied to the balance of payments through such measures without so great a slowing-up of the economy and effect on employment as would be damaging economically or unacceptable socially. Butthis report should certainly not be read as suggesting that credit restriction cannotcorrect the position without intolerable strains. Undoubedly the process will involve some hardship: profits will be harder to earn; there will be some temporaryunemployment while labour moves from industries which can no longer see marketsahead to those which can. But no method of dealing with this kind of situationcan be painless. And this policy will certainly have the best chances of success ina period such as the present in which world trade is progressive and expanding.Such an environment should also offer the best assurance against any danger thatthe credit contraction might prove difficult to check and lead the economy overinto a wholly unwished-for depression.Specific problems22. It would be wrong to lose sight of certain specific weaknesses. We need only refer to the coal problem and draw attention to the adverse impact on shipping of the import of coal. The present excess of demand for steel over production iscostly. Imports on animal feeding-stuffs are a heavy item, and the greater economicuse of grass would be of value. Imports of pulp, paper and board are large and increasing rapidly with modern packaging standards; complete liberalisation in thefirst half of 1956 (except newsprint) is allowed for in the figures (Annex I).
World economic trends23. Before examining the long-term prospects, there are some other considerations to weigh.24. The assumptions underlying our forecasts are in line with the analysis inthe latest report on World Trade and Economic Conditions. That report pointsout that the expansion of world trade over the past year was uneven and was concentrated to a large extent in Western Europe and North America, with only a relatively small expansion in the rest of the world. This unevenness in growth maywell continue for some time. The point is of importance for the United Kingdom,which is more dependent for its exports on the Sterling Area and other marketsoutside Europe and North America than are most of the other main manufacturingcountries. If we are to maintain our present share of world trade in manufactures,we must therefore make our exports more competitive than they now are, to penetrate further the expanding markets of Europe and North America, while atleast holding our own in the rest of the world.25. Secondly we note the rising United States trade surplus. It is true that,with their high rate of military expenditure and aid, the United States still expectan overall deficit of SI billion in 1955. But aid is increasingly linked with thepurchase of United States surpluses. And both military expenditure and aid aretending to shift from Europe to South-East Asia, that is to say to countries whichmight for various reasons more readily spend their dollars in the United Statesthan allow Europe to earn them by exporting. Both these trends could increasethe United States trade surplus and so decrease the net outflow of dollars.26. All this draws attention again to the importance of our competitive power. There are signs that we may be falling behind, and we are examiningwhether a comparison of changes in our wage, price and productivity levels withthose of our principal competitors, both the United States and some european countries (above all Germany), can usefully be made; but statistical comparison is difficult. There can, however, be no doubt that a period in which our costsrose less than those of our competitors would be of the greatest assistance incorrecting our balance of payments.The long-term prospects27. Looking now to the long-term, we are once more importing more than we can afford. This has been a continuing tendency since the war, masked fromtime to time by favourable movements in the terms of trade, and aggravated byunfavourable ones. But we ought to emphasise that the unfavourable movementin the terms of trade since April 1954 has been by no means severe, and is not morethan we ought to expect in conditions of world prosperity. We certainly cannotrely on substantially lower import prices except in association with a recessionwhich would damage our export markets. The Government have always taken the view that our interests are best served by expanding world trade; we see noreason to depart from it.28. If we are to take advantage of expanding world trade to secure theimprovement in our standards of living that the Government want to see, we need to aim at a steady rate of progress which is not impeded by changes in the economic climate whether brought about by monetary and fiscal measures or by other means in order to cope with recurring payments difficulties. We do not yet seemto have found the means of combining a steady expansion in production under conditions of full employment with the voluntary disciplines necessary to keepincomes whether from wages, salaries or other sources in step with the increasein production. This would seem to be the major economic problem before thecountry. To solve it will give the best hope of a constant improvement in ourliving standards for which we must not only produce rapidly increasing quantitiesof exports, but also sell them in competition with the United States, Germany,Japan and other countries.Summary and Conclusions(a) The overall current surplus of the United Kingdom, which was  300 million in 1953-54, is expected to have fallen to  50 million in 1954-55. The non-sterlingposition of the Sterling Area as a whole is expected to have changed from a surplusof  250 million to a deficit of  150 million (paragraphs 2-5).
(b) The United Kingdom overall current surplus is forecast to fall a littlefurther in 1955-56, and the Sterling Area deficit to be reduced somewhat. Withinthe margin of error of our forecasts we do not yet see any real change from the unsatisfactory position of 1954-55 (paragraphs 13-15).(c) The reactions of the underlying position on the sterling exchanges and reserves in the second half of 1954 were largely neutralised by a substantial inflowof short-term capital. We cannot rely upon this being repeated in 1955. Unlessthe remedial measures which have been taken are firmly maintained and reinforcedif necessary, the reserves may fall in 1955-56 by more than  100 million and thefall in the second half of 1955 (given the seasonal pattern) might be still larger.Indeed, unless the remedial measures are seen to be adequate and successful thefall could be greater by reason of a loss of confidence in sterling. Thus the second half of 1955 could be serious (paragraph 16).(d) The strikes and wage increases agreed since March could make the positionworse than our figures suggest. But remedial measures could bring about amarkedly better outturn if they succeed in slowing up the expansion of the economy. We have not yet the experience to judge how big a correction can beapplied to the balance of payments by this means without damage or unacceptablerepercussions. But we certainly do not suggest that credit restriction, to be effective,must bring about intolerable strains (paragraphs 17-21).(e) Coal, steel and animal feeding-stuffs are heavy items in the import bill and paper, pulp and board are increasing and will continue to do so (paragraph 22).(/) Our competitive position is exceedingly important, and we could well do with a period in which our costs rose less than those of our competitors(paragraphs 24-26).(g) If we want, under conditions of full employment, a steady expansion inthe economy without checks due to balance of payments difficulties, we must find the voluntary disciplines to keep incomes in step with the increase in production(paragraph 28).22nd June, 1955.48250c
ANNEX IAssumptionsThe assumptions on which our forecasts have been drawn up have been asfollows:  (a) The United Kingdom Index of Industrial Production will rise by 5 per cent.between 1954 and 1955, or 5* per cent, between 1953-54 and 1954-55and 4\ per cent, between 1954-55 and 1955-56.(b) Consumers&apos; expenditure will increase in real terms by 3\ per cent, between1954 and 1955, or 5 per cent, between 1953-54 and 1954-55 and 2\ percent, between 1954-55 and 1955-56.(c) Privately-held stocks of imported commodities will be at such levels as would be determined by commercial considerations in the light of an effective 4\ per cent. Bank Rate. In the economy as a whole stocks and work in progress will in general continue to increase in line with production, but less rapidly than in 1954, subject, however, toqualification so far as the effects of a 4\ per cent. Bank Rate would lead to a different conclusion^3)(d) Import and export prices will be those ruling in the markets about the endof April 1955, except where there are definite reasons for expecting.achange.  (In some cases, however, a basis in March has been taken.)(e) Recovery in the United States will be maintained.   About the middleof 1955 the level of industrial production will correspond approximatelyto the highest levels reached in the middle of 1953 and thereafter increasemore slowly, subject to seasonal adjustments. There will be continued expansion in Europe, though at a somewhat lower rate than in 1953-54.The United KingdomImportsGeneral1. We expect the volume of imports in 1954-55 to be some 6 per cent, higherthan in 1953-54, and the forecast for 1955-56 is a further increase at about thesame rate. Prices were rising sharply during most of 1954-55, while we assumelittle change for -1955-56 compared with the average for 1954-55. In value terms the increase in arrivals at  310 million or 17 per cent, in 1954-55 slows down to 130 million or 4 per cent, in 1955-56 (Table 4).2.\ In 1954-55 food, drink and feedingstuffs on the one hand and industrial materials on the other each account for some 40 per cent, of total imports (Table 4).But while an unchanged volume of food, drink and feedingstuffs cost  80 million more in 1954-55 than in 1953-54, the forecast increase of 4\ per cent, in volumein 1955-56 would, at the prices assumed, involve no further increase in value.Most food prices rose between 1953-54 and 1954-55 and a few (particularly meat)are expected to remain higher (on average) for 1955-56 than 1954-55, but others,especially tea, coffee, cocoa, and cheese are expected to stand at lower levels. Onthe other hand we forecast for industrial materials in 1955-56 a continuance of the 8 per cent, volume increase between 1953-54 and 1954-55: these volume increases would account for about  100 million increase in value in each year, but with higher prices the value increases are  150 million in 1954-55 and rather less (say 120 million) in 1955-56.3. Throughout the period there are reductions in recorded stocks of imported,commodities, due largely (though not exclusively) to the drawing down ofGovernment stocks at a greater rate than the rise in commercial stocks. these reductions amounted to under  15 million in 1953-54 but are forecast at over  50million in 1954-55 and under  20 million in 1955-56.   But we must emphasise1 (3) Our advice has been, however, that the interest rate to be paid, as distinct from traders&apos; viewof the market or actual refusal of finance, would have little effect.
that there may have been different trends in the movements of unrecorded stocksor partly processed materials, while changes in the total of stocks of all kindsheld in the economy (estimated at some  7,500 million) could have considerableeffects on import requirements.Table united Kingdom Imports by Commodity Groups				  millionTrade Accounts		1953-54	- 1954-55	1955-56Class and Division			(forecast)	(forecast)A.l-11, B.2, 13 ...

Apparent consumption (imports less re-exports plus recorded stockreductions) of imported food, drink and feeding-stuffs rises 5 per cent, in volumebetween 1953-54 and 1954-55; we forecast a further 1 per cent, rise in 1955-56.5. It is calculated that between 1953-54 and 1954-55 supplies allowed for a5 per cent, increase in real expenditure on food (at 1954 retail prices). This high rate is the same as the increase in real consumers&apos; expenditure as a whole, andwas largely accounted for by the increased consumption of meat followingderationing. It is thought that consumption did not immediately pick up to its full level on derationing, so that with this and the further 3 per cent, increase inconsumers&apos; real expenditure a further 2 per cent, increase in meat consumption is forecast for 1955-56. In general it is not to be expected that expenditure on foodwill increase as rapidly as other forms of consumers&apos; expenditure, while to someextent the increase may also tend to be concentrated on associated services, packingand processing rather than on the actual food-stuffs. We have allowed for onlya 1-j per cent, increase in real personal expenditure on food as a whole for 1955-56.6. The relation between total food supplies and apparent consumption ofimportedxfoods is of course far from direct (apart from the fact that the latter figure covers feeding-stuffs also). In particular, imports of cereals in 1953-54 were reduced by a bumper harvest, while the rate of home meat production in 1954-55was raised by early slaughtering and cannot, it is thought, continue.Feeding-stuffs7. Imports of feeding-stuffs (including coarse grains) cost  100 million in1953-54 and are rising about 10 per cent, a year: about 40 per cent, come fromthe Dollar Area. In considering the cost in terms of imports of feeding&quot; concentrates &quot; to animals, it is necessary to look also at the use of other&quot; concentrates&quot; offals and oilcake which are also by-products of home millingand oilseed pressing, imported feed wheat and home-produced grains. The usageof home-grown wheat may fluctuate widely between seasons, and thus distort the picture. But we are advised that wheat is probably not grown by farmers in orderto feed to their own animals, in the sense that grass is so grown. Thus in principleit is right to take home supplies as independent of demand and to assume that anyvariation of consumption of concentrates would fall upon imports. The total valueof concentrates (not all of them, of course, imported or capable of replacing otherimports) used in 1953-54 at a rough estimate of  27 a ton would be nearly 350 million. It is clear that any replacement of concentrates by grass, if it couldbe carried out in an efficient manner, could have a relatively large influence onimport requirements.48250 c 2
Industrial Materials8. One would not necessarily expect any close correlation between apparentconsumption of imported industrial materials and industrial production. the differences in raw material content of various types of production are very wide.While some materials are almost wholly imported others are largely produced athome, though home production may increase or (as in steel) fall behind relative to requierements. Apparent consumption of imported industrial materials is increasingby 8 per cent, in 1954-55 and 6 per cent, in 1955-56 rather faster than industrial production. This has also no doubt been influenced by the relaxation of control on certain materials (particularly timber, pulp and paper) supplies of which hadbeen wholly or partly restricted.9. Imports of all the main classes of industrial materials are increasing, withthe major exception of textile materials. The latter are showing relatively little change from  350 million in 1953-54; stocks have been falling but are now expectedto level out. Non-ferrous metals imports increased 10 per cent, between 1953-54and 1954-55 (when they were some  260 million) and are forecast to increase at a rather slower rate in 1955-56: the largest factor in this is aluminium, which isbeing more and more widely used for many purposes (aircraft and defence account for only 20 per cent, of direct consumption). Both copper and aluminium prices have risen, though we have assumed a price of only  310 per ton for copper for1955-56 (10 per cent, above 1954-55 and 35 per cent, above 1953-54, but somewhatbelow the current market quotation).10. Timber imports rise from  150 million in 1953-54 to  180 million in1954-55, but we forecast only a small further increase to  190 million in 1955-56.A large factor in the slower increase of timber imports is the expected check tothe increase in the rate of house-building, though more timber may now be usedper house: building accounts for 40 per cent; of softwood imports (which is the biggest item over  100 million). An actual reduction in the rate of building could have a significant effect on timber imports.11. Pulp and paper imports rise from  110 million in 1953-54 to  145 million in 1954-55, and at much the same rate, to  175 million, in 1955-56; these havebeen affected by considerable relaxations in 1954 and 1955, and take into accountproposals for Open General Licences, from January 1956, except for newsprint, asa way of meeting our liberalisation obligations.12. Steel imports rise from  25 million (f million ingot tons) in 1953-54 to 40 million (1 million ingot tons) in 1954-55 and  50 million (I  million ingot tons)in 1955-56. The greater part has to be taken from the Dollar Area. home production has proved inadequate to meet the increase in demand. The improve-ments in industrial production are of course largest in engineering and metal-using industries; apparent consumption is not extraordinary, the indices being 100, 109and 114 respectively, but it is possible that there is some hidden stock building. Thetotal imports of iron and steel ores, scrap and metal rise from  85 million in 1953-54to  100 million in 1954-55 and  130 million in 1955-56. As the cost of the iron-oreor even pig-iron content is far lower than that of steel, it is clear that the shortageof steel is a serious drain on the balance of payments; and this would be true evenif more steel production required not only more capacity, but more coal imports.Coal13. Imports rise from  5 million in 1953-54 to  35 million in 1954-55 and 55 million in 1955-56; about  20 million of the last figure is from the United States.The freight costs for 1955-56 are another  20 million-either in foreign shipping or british shipping diverted from other employment. The forecast assumes importsof 12 million tons in 1955; Ministers have so far only authorised 9  million tons forthe year ending October, but disappointing production has been further aggravated by the strikes in Yorkshire, and the extra must be allowed for if the policy it still to be to avoid shortages. The forecast assumes continuance in 1956 of the presentexport programme of 11 million tons per annum; this is under discussion, however,and is likely to be substantially curtailed in order to save still further imports.Imports by Area14. While imports from all areas have increased and are expected to increase,the greatest part of the expansion-over 50 per cent, of the whole between 1953-54
and 1954-55 is in the Dollar Area, which in 1953-54 provided only 17- - per cent, ofthe total. We expect only a little smaller proportion of the further increase in1955-56 to be in the Dollar Area. But to see this in perspective it is necessary topoint out that the percentage for 1953-54 was a very low one: the average for1948-54 was 20 per cent. Against this must be set the 21 per cent, reached in1954-55 and 22 per cent, forecast for 1955-56.Table united Kingdom Imports by Area  million f.o.b.			Per cent.

The main groups in which imports from the Dollar Area have increasedmost sharply are cereals and feeding-stuffs, and steel; non-ferrous metals, timber,pulp and paper, cotton, chemicals, vehicles, machinery and metal goods, and coalare also important. All except cotton are groups in which total imports haveincreased considerably, and the general indication is that the Dollar Area has not so much replaced other suppliers as met a large part of the increased demand.16. It looks, however, as though there may be a slight reduction since 1953-54in the volume of imports from the Sterling Area. But the volume of imports fromthe Sterling Area for 1953-54 was extraordinarily high, both in relation to previous years (19 per cent, above the average for 1948-54) and in relation to total imports in that year (which were 8 per cent, above the average for 1948-54).Exports17. The trade returns already available make it reasonably safe to anticipatean increase of some 5 per cent, in export earnings in .1954-55 compared with1953-54. On the information so far available we shall probably still be losing asmall fraction of our share in world exports of manufactures, and we must forecasta continuation of this trend in 1955-56. In fact we have to reckon with the increasingly competitive position of Germany and Japan as well as the effects of amore widespread relaxation of discrimination against dollar goods. Taking allthese general factors into account and allowing for the unfavourable outlook inAustralia for 1955-56, we do not think we can expect more than a slight improve-ment in the rate of increase in the value of exports in 1955-56. We do not look forany significant change in prices overall.18. , For exports to the Dollar Area in 1955-56 we forecast shipments to theUnited States at some 10 per cent, about 1953 levels and to Canada at aboutthe 1953 level. Exports to Canada have been slower to recover; while we lostground relatively in that market in 1954 we should regain some of this if demandrevives, particularly in wool textiles, and if United States competition becomesless severe, as it may with increasing home activity.19. We expect exports to O.E.E.C. countries to benefit from the continuedrise in industrial activity and incomes in that area. Further liberalisation of trade should help also. Some  20 million of the increase between 1954-55 and 1955-56represents increased off-shore purchases. In the group of other non-sterling countries, our exports to Finland, Egypt, Persia and Argentina in particular canbe expected to improve.

The forecast of a modest increase in exports to the Colonies, and indeedmost other R.S.A. countries, takes account of growing competition from japan and O.E.E.C. countries; South Africa is expected to increase its imports relativelysubstantially, and although we face stern competition in this market we should share to some extent in the benefit. The Australian restrictions are taken to cuther imports by not more than  80 million per annum below the 1954-55 rate, ofwhich the cut for United Kingdom goods would represent about  35 million:while these will not begin to reduce Australian imports until about October, theywill, owing to the time factor, affect our export shipments as from the beginningof 1955-56. No further increase in shipments to New Zealand is expected.Table 7Types of United Kingdom Exports^Engineering productsTextiles   ...Other exports1953-541,0103401,3301954-55(forecast)1,0603201,4102,790  million1955-56(forecast)1,1803101,4302,920Total shipments of exports        2,670* Excluding re-exports.21. While we forecast a 5 per cent, increase in total export shipments for1955-56 we expect little change in textile exports as a whole; but there will probablybe a fall in cotton goods despite some improvement in exports to India and Pakistan.Exports of engineering products are expected to expand by 12 per cent, and to account for nearly 85 per cent, of the whole increase, which is even more than theydid between 1953-54 and 1954-55. Road vehicles play a large part in this, despite the cut in their important Australian market. Chemicals among the great variety of other exports have done well and are expected to continue to do so.

The oil industry, while no different in principle from other British-ownedextractive industries operating internationally, calls for special treatment by reasonof its importance, complexity and flexibility. It imports oil, mainly in crude form,to provide for United Kingdom oil consumption and exports of refined products;takes United Kingdom exports of equipment: supplies oil for Her Majesty&apos;s forces overseas; and provides for substantial increases in our overseas investments (forthe development of production, refining and marketing facilities, and by thepurchase or sale of assets). After paying for all these transactions (which feature,as net debits in various parts of the Balance of Payments) from its overseas earningsthere remains an exchange surplus. The sum of all these appears therefore in theBalance of Payments as the net oil credit in Invisibles; it is an estimate of the net profit from the oil companies&apos; overseas operations, corresponding to the net profits of tea or rubber plantations or of tin mines.Table 9Oil Transactions in the United Kingdom Balance of Payments  million1953-54 1954-55 1955-56(forecast)       (forecast)Items (debit) (oil, equipment, tankers, &amp;c.)included in Visible Balance   ......... 70 95 80Oil for Her Majesty&apos;s Forces overseas includedin Government expenditure    ......... 10 10 10Net investment and other capital transactions ... 120 45 45Exchange surplus, after providing for above   ... 35 30 40Net oil credit in Invisibles*......... 230 180 170United Kingdom consumption ...      ...      ...

The jump in the visible debit balance in 1954-55 was due largely to a fall in exports of equipment, which are, however, expected to recover in 1955-56.Home consumption, particularly in black oils, is increasing steadily. Despite thegrowth in the industry&apos;s world-wide operations, the &quot; profits &quot; (net oil invisibles)have been reduced by the growth of payments, to Persia, and to the local governments of oil producing countries in the Middle East mostly in the sterling area under the new agreements recently negotiated or under negotiation withthem by the oil companies. Year-to-year variations are also affected by changesin timing of payments, arrears and advances of tax these swelled the credit in1953-54 and reduce it in 1954-55 and 1955-56. Given stability in internationaloil prices and in the revenue arrangements with the Middle East countries, and
subject to the hazards of all economic forecasting, there is now a prospect, withthe increasing demand for oil in the world and especially in the Eastern Hemisphere,of growth both in the net oil credit and in the exchange surplus from oiltransactions.24. Net investment overseas is falling, partly because of the completion oflarge refinery programmes in the R.S.A. and elsewhere and partly because of risingdepreciation on these and other assets. Generally speaking, however, the oil industry is maintaining the level of its gross investment overseas. The exchangesurplus brought in by the oil industry in 1953-54 was in the R.S.A. and non-sterling countries outside the Dollar Area. There was a deficit of over  250 million withthe Dollar Area. This dollar deficit has fallen considerably (to  180 million) andshould remain at about this level in 1955-56, though it is threatened by the pressure in United States to reduce oil imports. The surplus in the R.S.A. is disappearingowing to the increase in payments already referred to, but that in the O.E.E.C.countries is increasing rapidly.Government Overseas Expenditure25. There is an increase of some  40 million in net expenditure between1953-54 and 1954-55, caused about equally by greater expenditure (mainly military expenditure in the Colonies and Colonial grants) and smaller receipts, but we hopethere will be no further increase in 1955-56, despite the inclusion of a paymentof  10 million in the first half of 1956 towards the cost of maintaining our forcesin Germany. This is expected to rise to some  80 million a year unless germany can be induced in N.A.T.O. to share the burden. We have made no provision forour liability to the United States for the cost of logistic support in Korea.Special Receipts from United States and Canada26. These include expenditure by the United States and Canadian forcesin this country and offshore sales for delivery to our own forces (but not for export to other countries, such sales being included in exports). They have been extractedboth on account of their intrinsic importance and to avoid distortion of the&quot; Government expenditure&quot; and &quot; Other invisibles &quot; items between which the programmes Committee used to spread them. The jump from about  75 million in 1954-55 to  95 million in 1955-56 is due to the big deliveries of a large order of aircraft expected in the first half of 1956; it seems that about half the offshoreorders for items for delivery to the United Kingdom will remain to be completed.This virtually offsets the fall in Defence Aid.Other invisibles -27. Other invisibles (net) are expected to continue their slow fall in 1955-56.United Kingdom earnings from investments in the R.S.A. are some  25 millionhigherin 1954-55 than 1953-54, owing mainly to higher prices for the products in which we are interested. We expect this level to be maintained in 1955-56despite, on balance, lower prices, since the amount of United Kingdom investmentshas been steadily growing; but there will be a sizeable increase in outgoings for interest, profits and dividend owing to the effect on the cost of servicing sterlingliabilities of maintaining dearer money. Higher tramp freight rates in whichgrowing pressure on shipping to carry out imports of coal is an important factor and increased quantities of imports lead to a large increase in shipping payments.Earnings, however, also improve significantly, through the modest rise in liner-freights, the increased shipments of exports and our share in the carriage of ahigher volume of world trade, and the overall shipping credit rises slightly overthe period. In travel the increase in pur earnings is not quite keeping up with therise in our outgoings; the earnings are predominantly from the R.S.A. and the dollar Area and the outgoings of O.E.E.C. countries.The Rest of the Sterling Area28. Our forecasts indicate a gradual rise (of the order of 5 per cent, perannum) in the exports of the R.S.A. to the world as a whole with little change in average prices; this is parallel with a rather higher rise in imports. This rise in imports has been rather more rapid in the case of imports from the rest of theworld than in that of imports from the United Kingdom; the decline in the UnitedKingdom share in Colonial imports is from about 45 per cent, in 1953-54 to about

Allowing for seasonal fluctuations the non-sterling surplus of the R.S.A.began to decline sharply about the beginning of 1954; we forecast a veryconsiderable decline between 1953-54 and 1954-55, with some recovery in 1955-56.As is apparent from Table 10, however the greater part of this fluctuation can beascribed to changes in the position of Australia, and in the remaining countries ofthe R.S.A. as a whole the general trends referred to above are reflected in the comparatively moderate and continuing reduction in the non-sterling surplus.32. World prices of most R.S.A. export commodities, with the majorexception of wool, rose between 1953-54 and 1954-55. The forecast for 1955-6implies rather a lower level of prices. The increase in earnings in 1954-55represented by these movements has been offset, however, by the severe declinein, the price of merino wool. Australia^ loss between 1953-54 and 1954-55 on non-sterling wool earnings was some  35 million, and very little improvement isexpected in 1955-56. Developments which might favourably affect the woolposition would be a strong increase in world demand and further purchases by russia but no such developments are in sight. The recovery in the United states is expected to have a relatively limited effect on clothing sales, and wool has tomeet increasing competition from synthetic fibres.* Inter-R.S.A. trade is excluded from the totals on which these percentages are based.48250D40 per cent, in 1954-55, with little change forecast for 1955-56, while the UnitedKingdom share in the imports of the Independent R.S.A. is expected to fall moregradually from 52 per cent, in 1953-54 to 50 per cent, in 1955-56.*29. Apart from the growing effectiveness of German and Japanese corn-petition, the increase in imports from sources other than the United Kingdom canparticularly be ascribed to the influence of loans and grants and to a variety of measures of liberalisation. The latter include non-discrimination against the dollar Area by South Africa and Pakistan, relaxation of restrictions on importsfrom O.E.E.C. countries and Japan in the Colonies, and all round relaxations inAustralia and New Zealand.10. R.S.A. imports from Japan are expected to increase by about 50 per cent,(over  50 million) between 1953-54 and 1954-55; little further change is expected in 1955-56, though we have forecast some increase in R.S.A. exports to Japan inview of our efforts to induce her to balance her sterling payments position.
33. The world price of rubber rose sharply at the end of 1954. The averageassumed for 1954-55 and 1955-56 is around 2s. per lb., nearly 40 per cent, higherthan 1953-54, but below the current price. With strong competition from syntheticin America it is improbable that a substantially higher price will be maintained for very long. But the strength of world demand for natural rubber, especially in western Europe, should be adequate to maintain firm prices.34. The price of tea, both Indian and Ceylon, reached in 1954-55 an average level 60 per cent, higher than in 1953-54; even after the recent break it is only alittle below the halfway level which we assume for 1955-56. Tea affects mainly,though not exclusively, trade with the United Kingdom. Amongst other commodities important for non-sterling earnings, the price of copper has been rising since 1953-54 and is expected to continue at high levels in 1955-56, thoughthe price we have assumed,  310 per ton, is somewhat below the present market.Cocoa, which has secured very high prices for some years, has fallen heavily andwe have assumed for 1955-56 a price more than 10 per cent, below the 1953-54level.35. An increase of some  40 million in the deficit of the Colonies on current account is forecast for 1955-56 compared with 1954-55. This is based on the assumptions (which may or may not prove correct) that the surplus which WestAfrica has had for some years will disappear, mainly as a result of lower cocoaprices, and that there will be little change in other regions taken together. TheColonies as a whole are expected to have an adverse current balance of some 80 million, outweighed by a substantial, inflow (mainly for the United Kingdom)of capital, which, for developing countries, may be said to represent a normalpattern.36. Perhaps the best single indicator of the trend in the overall position ofthe R.S.A. countries, taking the development of their transactions with the UnitedKingdom and the non-sterling world together, can be seen in the movements oftheir sterling balances. Colonial sterling balances have been rising steadily for anumber of years; there should be little change in the rate between 1953-54 and1954-55, in each of which the increase would be of the order of  100 million, but our forecasts (paragraph 35) imply increase of only about  40 million in 1955-56.A striking feature of our forecasts for 1955-56 is an expected increase of  140million in the balances of the Middle East oil countries. This reflects the verylarge and rapidly growing payments they receive on account of royalties and taxes(see paragraph 23). For the moment these large sums are mainly held on depositor invested in sterling securities and it is difficult to foresee the use. to be made ofthem as they continue to flow in in the future.37. Owing to the rapid increase of imports in 1954-55, and lower export earnings mainly on account of the weakness in the wool market, Australia^ sterling balances, which had been, approximately unchanged in 1953-54, are expected to fall by as much as  120 million in 1954-55. Some recovery of exports and therestrictions on imports recently imposed by the Australian Government areexpected to check this decline in 1955-56. They are calculated to save  80 million of imports in a full year ( 35 million from the United Kingdom and  45 million from other sources) but will not be fully operative on goods arriving in Australiabefore October 1955. The Australian non-sterling surplus is expected to increase from about  35 million in 1954-55 to  65 million in 1955-56.38. Our forecasts imply a comparatively modest drawing down of balances inthe remaining countries of the R.S.A,, broadly offsetting in 1955-56 the increase inbalances anticipated in the Colonies. This is mainly accounted for by New zealand and South Africa. The New Zealand position depends very largely on meat andcrossbred wool prices, while the development of imports under the new regime of credit restriction following on the abolition of exchange allocations is particularlydoubtful. The level of South African imports has been increasing and is expectedto increase further, and the Minister of Finance has indicated that he would regardwith equanimity a loss of reserves on the scale expected (much wider fluctuations in the balances might in fact be occasioned by changes in capital movementsbetween the United Kingdom and South Africa). South Africa&apos;s non-sterlingsurplus is expected to decline only moderately from  80 million in 1954-55 to 60 million in 1955-56, compared with  50 million in 1953-54.
United Kingdom Capital Transactions: Movements of MonetaryAssets and Liabilities39. Movements of capital above all of short-term capital are difficult to.estimate and only in the most limited sense can they be forecast. We can onlyuse available estimates of capital movements to date, and assume that these willcontinue, taking account of known specific obligations and transactions andabnormal circumstances. Certain important types of short-term capital movement the sale or purchase of gold or dollars against holdings of sterling balances do not of course directly affect the figures of monetary assets and liabilities, sincethe consequent changes in sterling liabilities and reserves cancel each other out inthe total. Many other types of short-term capital movement (including &quot; leads andlags &quot;) must however be taken into account, and these are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, confidence and many other unpredictable factors. Thusat best our forecasts of the movements of monetary assets and liabilities are anattempt to indicate the underlying effects which might be expected to result fromthe forecasts we make for the current balance and the Sterling Area surplus or deficit.40. We have made allowance in 1955-56 for the repayment of  7^ millionborrowed in the United States in 1954-55 against purchases of tobacco. Most ofthe long-standing  20 million credit obligation to Argentina is now expected tobe used in .1955-56. Drawings of  1 million on the  10 million Export Creditsfacilities for Persia are provided for, as well as  5 million for the United Kingdomsubscription to the International Finance Corporation. On the other hand we allow for no further increase in the Japanese &quot; usance credit,&quot; which was considerablyexpanded in 1954-55. Capital receipts by British Petroleum Limited from thepartners in the Persian Oil Consortium amount to  16 million in 1954-55 but only 8 million in 1955-56. There was a considerable inflow of short-term capital in sterling balances in both halves of 1954-55. While there was in addition asubstantial inflow of other forms of short-term capital in the second half of 1954,there was an offsetting (but possibly smaller) outflow of these in the first half of1955.41. Our forecasts suggests that the gap between the non-sterling deficit andthe movement of monetary assets and liabilities (see Table 1) would probably widenagain and indeed be rather greater than in 1953-54. The reserves were fortified in1954^55 by short-term capital movements in the form of increases in sterling balances, and by &quot; swap &quot; transactions (e.g., for Argentina) which are expected tobe reversed in 1955i-56, while there were large increases in 1954-55 in Japanesesterling holdings which, if our policy succeeds, will not be repeated on so great a scale in 1955-56. These and other factors suggest, unless there were large short-term capital inflows or changes in long-term capital movements, a larger fall in the reserves in 1955-56 than in 1954-55 despite the reduced non-sterling deficit.42. We forecast little change in the flow of &quot; Investment, borrowing, &amp;c.&quot; tothe R.S.A. This forecast is in fact very hazardous; the flow is particularly subjectto the state of the United Kingdom capital market, for only a moderate proportionof it is for official loans and development projects.
