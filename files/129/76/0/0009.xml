Her Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the initiative ofthe Maltese Prime Minister in putting forward proposals for a oloserassociation between Malta and the United Kingdom.     The administrative and financial aspects of these proposals are at present under discussionwith the Maltese Government Delegation.These proposals include a suggestion that Malta while retain-ing its own Legislative Assembly should in future be represented in the parliament at Westminster.     The Government view this suggestion withsympathy and feel that this sentiment will be shared by the House.Before embarking, however, on an innovation of such importanceHer Majesty1 s Government feel that it would be right for them to havethe &quot;benefit,of the general feelings of the House.     They therefore propose to convene a special conference, comprising representatives ofall the political Parties in the Parliament at Westminster, to consider this particular aspect of the problem.     This conference would call into consultation the representatives of ^the two political Parties in Maltawho are now in London.     The Government intend that, when this special conference has completed its deliberations, its conclusions shall betaken into account in the round-table talks which the Colonial secretary is conducting.copy wo.CABINET
