I believe that it is impossible for a country to avoid progressiveinflation while it sustains over-full employment.3. I believe that it is also impossible to avoid continuous increases in prices in that situation.4. Three adverse consequences are probable from allowing demandfor labour to exceed supply:-(a) The consequent rise in prices will reduce our exporttrade in favour of countries where inflation is at a lower rate than ours: in effect we shall be pricedout of the markets.    This is a present danger.(b) We shall lose export trade to countries that can promiseearlier deliveries: this is now happening in the ship-&quot;building industry.(c) Productivity will not increase as quickly as new processeswould justify.    Human nature being what it is, industrial workers do not put out their best endeavours in a periodof over-full employment.5. The core of our trouble is that we are trying nationally to dotoo much - an error for which we roundly condemned the Labour Govern-merit,60 We have been urging increased productivity on those engagedin industry and restriction of credit on the banks.    In neither case does the Government control the situation, and both bodies of people in private conversation are asking, not unnaturally, what we are doing as a Govern-ment with the situations we can control,,.7, The power of the Treasury to check further inflation by monetary policy is now very limited: it is a power to curb and not a power to cure.The bank rate has, I believe, done as much as it is likely to be able to dowithout disturbing international confidence: the financial squeeze by the
banks will help, but it is mainly operating against private house-building and private enterprise in industry.80 Inflation is a consequence and not the cause of the trouble weare in     I submit that the Government should take defined and declaredsteps to reduce the excessive demand for labour and materials, so thatwe move to a position in which demand for labour no longer exceeds thesupply.    This is not to advocate the creation of unemployment.    Thereis a great deal of difference between the Government fulfilling all the pledges that it has given to create and maintain a high and stable levelof employment;  and trying to do everything at once in its desire to get on speedily with needed improvements in our economic and social life.9. I recognise the difficulty in deciding where to act.    I makebold to say that a postponement for twelve months might be possible inour railway and road programmes; some deliberate reduction in thehousing programme as fore-shadowed by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand, I should hope, some reduction in the demands of the Services both for equipment and for men.10.        Such a course would be unpalatable to the Ministers concernedbut I greatly fear that if we go on overburdening the labour force as weare doing at present we shall be on the road to a much graver situationinvolving more serious issues than the postponement for a year of someexcellent programmes of development.11. I repeat - the problem calling for action is a reduction in thedemand for labour.    If we secure this we will check the rises in prices,we will encourage productivity and assist our balance of payments, andit may well be that we shall improve industrial relations.12.        To those who fear that any curb on development may affect our industrial efficiency I draw attention to the fact that this is muchmore likely to occur as a result of the credit squeeze on private enter-prise than from a reduction in public spending of the kind I propose.\ .W.Office of the Duchy of Lancaster, S0W.l. ,26th July, 1955.
