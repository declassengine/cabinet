confidential.P.(55) 9223rd July, 1955JAPANESE WAR criminals memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs this is the story of the Japanese war criminals.2.        Major War CriminalsThese are held by 8 Powers.    Of these, 6 including all theCommonwealth Governments concerned, think they should be let out after10 years from the date of their arrest and we have decided to agree.We are not sure of the attitude of the Netherlands, but they seem likelyto follow suit,    On that basis the 7 major war criminals still in prisonwill be let out on different dates between September 1955 and April 1956.The only question still at issue is whether they should be releasedunconditionally, or only on parole.3.        Minor War CriminalsThese are the ones for whom we have the sole responsibility.I propose that the same principle should be applied.    They should be letout after 10 years.    The effect would be that releases would be spreadfrom now over the next 3 years (see Annex I).\4,        Other countries are broadly accepting the 10 year principle sofar as their prisoners are concerned (see Annex II).    If the Cabinet, as i hope, agrees that we should show not less clemency than the United States,Australia, France, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Canada and NewZealand, I would be willing to see General Percival (President of the Fax*East Prisoners of War Association) if possible before the government&apos;s decision was made public.H.M.Geneva,22nd July, 1955.COPY NO.3tCABINET
