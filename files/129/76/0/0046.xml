(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 96 COPY NO. (9 f25th July, 1955CABINETNEW PARK LANE scheme memorandum by the Minister of works in C.P. (55) 91 the Minister of Transport submits proposals forcarrying out the original Hyde Park Boulevard scheme together with an east-west underpass at Hyde Park Corner.    I am very conscious of the traffic difficulties, both at Hyde Park Corner and at Marble Arch, butthere is little doubt that this scheme will meet with very strong opposition,2.        The scheme involves the loss of a considerable strip on the eastand areas on the north and south edges of Hyde Park, much of the presentSpeakers1 Corner, the whole of the recently reconstructed Hamilton Gardens,part of the Green Park, part of Buckingham Palace gardens, several lodgesof some artistic interest and about 100 trees, half of which are big trees.Some of the trees to be lost on the Piccadilly side of the Green Park andin Buckingham Palace gardens are particularly fine ones,3.        The Royal Fine Art Commission have stated in a letter to theLondon County Council that, in their opinion, &quot;such traffic advantages as might result are heavily outweighed by the disadvantages to the park ....the scheme is not one which the Commission could in any circumstancessupport&quot;.    I think a great many people will agree with them.4.        My colleagues will have seen an article in &quot;The Times&quot; onFriday, 22nd July, in which these words occur - &quot;the Royal Parks areamong the most cherished amenities of London and the envy of all othercapitals.    They have been guarded from encroachment through thecenturies and to propose tampering with them now raises questions ofthe utmost seriousness&quot;.    The article goes on to point out that thisencroachment will pave tlae way for further demands as soon as theproposed scheme proves inadequate for future traffic.5.        The Road Research Laboratory expressed some doubts as towhether the original scheme without an underpass would do much to solve the traffic problem.    The proposed underpass is an addition to the original scheme and was never an integral part of it.   It does seem possible that,if the problem is re-examined from the beginning on the understandingthat underpasses will be allowed, some different scheme less damaging to the amenities of the parks might be devised.N.B.Ministry of Works, S.E.I. ,25th July, 1955
