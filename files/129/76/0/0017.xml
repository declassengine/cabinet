COPY NO.  O 7HOUSING SUBSIDIESMemorandum by the Minister of housing and -Local GovernmentI was invited by my colleagues to submit a memorandum&quot;On thequestion of housing subsidies (C. M. (55) 21st Conclusions, Minute 7),2.     At present 40 per cent of the cost of the typical Council house is paid for out of subsidy (three-quarters by the Exchequer and one-quarterby the local authority).    This year the Exchequer subsidy on permanent houses in England and Wales amounts to nearly  50 millions, and is increasing at the rate of  5 millions each year.3.     The large subsidy has encouraged local authorities to chargeunjustifiably low&quot; rents.    In many areas the rent (exclusive of rates) fora post-war three-bedroomed house is no more than 12/- a Week, and insome Cases the rent for a similar pre-war house is as little as 7/-.With &quot;the average worker in industry to-day earning over  10 a week,it is&apos; evident that the majority of Council tenants could well &quot;afford to pay more than they do and that an increasing number have no need to be subsidised at all.4. There is, therefore, a clear case for a substantial reduction in theExchequer contribution to local authority housing.5.     We will, of course, have to continue to pay subsidy on housesalready built or approved.6.     As regards house-building, I am in process of working out proposals which would have the effect of reducing the number of new houses on which subsidy was payable to about 100,000 a year, as comparedwith about 180,000 at present.    This would be achieved by concentratingthe subsidy on the most important objectives, namely slum clearanceand the relief of urban congestion.7.     The curtailment of subsidy would no&quot; doubt lead to some reductionin house-building by local authorities in areas where the need is nolonger great.    On the other hand, in districts wherethere is still aserious shortage of accommodation, it should not prevent Councils frommaintaining a high rate of construction,8,     The number of new dwellings built each year normally representsonly a small proportion of the total&apos;pool of Council houses in the area.The lose of subsidy could, therefore, usually be offset by small increases(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(55) 6712th July, 1955CABINET
in rents spread over the whole pool.    As an alternative, it couldbe offset by introducing one&quot;or other of the differential rent schemes, under whichtenants are required to pay as much as they can reasonably afford.9.     The Cabinet&quot;will obviously not wish to take any final decision onthis important matter without a good deal of further thought.    Meanwhile,the raising of the &quot;interest rates of the Public &quot;Works Loan &quot;Boards, withthe resultant increase in the costs of local authority housebuilding, is bound to lead to Questions in Parliament as to whether we intend toincrease the housing subsidy.10.    If my colleagues approve, I should like to take this opportunity tosay:-(a) that the Government definitely do not intend to increasethe housing subsidy;(b) that, in fact, we are at present examining the rates ofthe housing subsidy and the purposes for Which itis allocated, with a view to considering whether any changes are desirable;(c) that I shall shortly be having discussions with LocalAuthority Associations on this &quot;subject and that afurther statement will be made after the recess.11.     A statement of this kind would have two advantages&quot;.    &quot;First, itwould begin to prepare the minds of all concerned for some reduction ofthe housing subsidy.    Secondly, it would enable me to discuss the problem,in general terms, with the Local Authority Associations and to obtain from them the information and advice which I need before I can formulatefirm proposals.12.    I accordingly ask my colleagues to authorise me to reply to questions on the lines indicated in paragraph 10 above.D.S.Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, S. W. 1.11th July, 1955.
