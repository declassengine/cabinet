secret.P.(55) 69 COPY NO.11th July, 1955CABINETMONOPOLIES COMMISSION REPORTON COLLECTIVE DISCRIMINATIONMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeTwas asked to circulate a note indicating the line&apos;&quot;I proposedto take on the Monopolies Commission Report, both in my meeting withthe Trade and Industry Committee of the Party on Tuesday &quot;and in opening the Debate in theHouse of CommonS&quot;on Wednesday,    I have discussed it with my colleagues on the Committee appointed for this purpose and they agree with it and with the draft Motion (set out in the Annex to this paper)which has been placed on the Order Paper,2. There is a majority and minority report of the Commission,There is at any rate this common ground between them - that somesensible method has to be found of sifting those practices which aretolerable in the public interest from those which are not.    The majority report favours prohibition of the practices subject to an arrangement for allowing exceptions where a case for doing so can be made Out,    the minority report favours registration of the practices followed by a continuation of the existing arrangements for case by case examination.It seems to me to be inherent in either of these proposals&quot;&apos;that industrialistswho claim that they can establish a case for continuing their &quot;practiceshould have an opportunity of being heard before the practice is banned,3, The drawback to accepting the minority report is that apartfrom registration we should go on exactly as we are.    The&quot;drawback  &quot;&apos; .to the majority report is that if we followed it in detail (see for exampleparagraph 248) we should be declaring a whole range of practices deeplyimbedded in British industry to be criminal, and be fixing a date (whichwe should find it very hard to keep to) at which they would have to cometo an end.    Further, on the majority report as it now stands &quot;we should leave individual resale price maintenance,&quot; which was in general bles&quot;sedby the Lloyd Jacob Report, without any effective method of enforcement.&apos;4, In these circumstances I propose a course mid-way between these two views as follows  -(a)   We should require registration of those restrictive practices which we specify,   &quot;Th&apos;e&quot;se may extend beyond those referred to in the report.    It would for example be our intention to require registrationofall arrangements for collective price fixing&apos;.    In thecase of practices outside the scope of the Report nofurther general action would be taken upon them pending areport from the Monopolies Commission.

(b) In the case of those practices which are concernedwith &quot;collective discrimination&apos;(i. e. those dealt withinthe Report) no one would be allowed to resort tothem who had not registered them, and after registrationthey would be called upon to come forward and &quot;make out their &quot;case before a tribunal for employing these particulardeviceso    The onus of showing that the practice was inthe public interest would be placed upon the industrialistconcerned.(c) If the tribunal decided in&quot; favour of the applicant he wouldbe able to go on with the practice subject to&quot; any provisions which&apos;the tribunal might lay down.    If it decided against him he would have to abandon that practice.&quot;5. These arrangements combine, in my view, the best of bothreports.    They avoid the wholesale outlawing of practices and the note of criminality inherent in the majority report, as well as the apparentinertia of the minority report.6. There is an important matter concerned with the enforcement of individual price maintenance.    In our judgment machinery for enablingindividually fixed prices to be maintained ought to go on, and I proposeto say so.    I would, however, also say that we are examining &quot;whether&quot;methods could be&quot;found whereby these individually fixed prices can bemaintained by methods less open to criticism than some referred to inthe report.7. For the rest I propose to draw attention to the large &quot;range of important problems of a highly complex and technical character which remain to be solved,    I would invite the House to let us have their comments upon them; they include such questions as what kind of a tribunal should be set up.    Should it be a new form of monopolies&quot;commission?    Should a Judge or a Minister make the ultimate decision?What kind of guidance on public interest should be given to it?    It mightbe right in some cases, e, g. aggregated rebates, to indicate&quot;that the onus would be easily discharged.    In other cases, e, g, those singledout by the minority, the test would be stricter.    In. all these &quot;matters theviews expressed in the course of Wednesday^ debate and the subsequentcomment and discussion will be of considerable assistance in draftingnecessary legislation.8. * It is the method of enforcement of the practices referred towhich gives rise to a great deal of public criticism.      Even &quot;where&quot; thetribunal decides that a practice may be continued we should examineclosely the actual methods, e, g. collective boycott or private courts,used to sustain the practice, and do our best to ensure &quot;that the obnoxiousfeatures, e, g. secrecy, which give rise to unfavourable comment areeliminated.9. I am satisfied, from the soundings I have already taken invarious quarters of the Conservative Party, that we shall get &quot;general support for this policy and for the Motion attached at the Annex.Board of Trade, S.W.1.9th July, 1955.
TERMS OF GOVERNMENT MOTION&quot;That this House welcomes the Reportof the Monopolies Commission on collectivediscrimination as a basis upon which theGovernment can formulate its proposals. &quot;
