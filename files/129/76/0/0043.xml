THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1955SECRET Copy No.  g $CP. (55) 9325th July, 1955CABINETNEWSPRINTMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade at present detailed control is exercised over the delivery of newsprint and thenumber of pages (whether or not printed on newsprint) which any newspapermay publish. This is because we have been unable to afford unlimited imports,the bulk of which would come from Canada.2. All this involves detailed intervention in the affairs of the Press, regularattacks upon the Government by them and, more recently, the problem of reconciliation between The Times, which is determined to print a much largerissue on a rather different sort of paper, and the other newspapers.3. In an endeavour to ease the situation, the Chancellor of the exchequer has agreed that the level of imports may be raised substantially and, while suppliesup to this level are unlikely to be obtainable at present, we are at least sparedthe accusation of deliberately creating a shortage.4. I have informed the Newsprint Supply Company that, while this ceilingon imports must continue as a safeguard to the balance of payments, it was asthey admitted purely nominal, and that in these circumstances the proper course,which they have long pressed on me and my predecessors, was to withdraw alldelivery and page controls, leaving them freedom to use as much paper as theyindividually desired and could obtain.5. The Times naturally welcomes this conclusion. The other leading nationaldailies on the Board of the Newsprint Supply Company have expressed extremeanxiety (always on behalf of newspapers not present at my meetings) at the dislocation which might ensue from the revival of the &quot; underlying contracts &quot;between individual newspapers and the mills which make the newsprint. these contracts cover large supplies to some newspapers; and little, if anything, to others.6. The mills, for their part, are quite ready to re-negotiate these contractson a realistic basis of fair shares for all and, in particular, to accept as a first charge on their output the needs of the small newspapers, mainly local weeklies,who would certainly suffer in a scramble and for whom the home mills recognisea responsibility.7. But the bigger newspapers have, in effect, implied that they are not willing to sacrifice any part of the supplies coming to them under the underlyingcontracts and will hold Her Majesty&apos;s Government responsible for any sufferingwhich may occur should control be removed before there is sufficient newsprintto satisfy all requirements. There is a certain element of bluff in this. Not allthe big papers are equally well safeguarded, and some would benefit byredistribution. Conversely, some of the small locals are part of influential Groups.The hostility to freedom comes from those papers whose supplies are not as firmlyguaranteed as they would like (e.g., the Express) and from those like the Telegraphwho fear they will be unable to keep up with The Times.48454
8.   There are only two alternatives:  (1) To retain all the present controls until the Newsprint Supply Companyagree that supplies are ample. This could not be before 1957, and ismuch more likely to be 1958 or even 1959. This course could andwould be represented by The Times as designed solely to prevent it from using the additional paper supplies which, by its enterprise, it had made available.(2) To announce, about mid-August when the current rationing period ends,that it was my intention to remove all controls (other than a highimport ceiling) six months later. I would emphasise the importanceHer Majesty&apos;s Government attached to the provision of adequate supplies for the smaller papers, and express the hope that in the intervening six months the large newspapers with underlying contracts and the home mills could find means of safeguarding this point.9. I have told the Newsprint Supply Company that I favour the latteralternative, but that before making the announcement I will consult my colleagues.The decision would not be irrevocable. If by, say, December it was clear thatthe large newspapers were unwilling, or unable, to arrange for a distribution of available supplies which gave reasonable safeguards to the smaller papers, itwould be open to us to call the operation off upon the basis that our prerequisitecondition had not been met. At best, we shall achieve the abolition of these controls; at worst, we shall demonstrate where the responsibility for a further three years of detailed control lies.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,23rd July, 1955.
