Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1955CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   78CP. (55) 7615th July, 1955CABINETGOVERNMENT POLICY ON CHARITABLE TRUSTSNote by the Lord President of the council the report of Lord Nathan&apos;s Committee on the Law and Practice relating toCharitable Trusts (Cmd. 8710) was presented to Parliament by the former PrimeMinister on 16th December, 1952. It was then stated on behalf of the Governmentin the House of Lords that the report was receiving the careful consideration ofthe Government, who would announce their decision upon the recommendations in due course (Official Report, Col. 998). The recommendations in the report have since been studied in detail, under the aegis of the Home Affairs Committee, firstby a Committee of officials and thereafter by a Sub-Committee of Ministers underthe Chairmanship of the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance. The HomeAffairs Committee recently agreed to recommend to the Cabinet that the Govern-ment should now announce their decisions on the various questions which arise onthe report in the terms of the draft White Paper attached to this note (Appendix A).2. In Chapter 8 of their report the Nathan Committee made certain recommendations about the range of trustee investments. To the extent that these recommendations concern charitable trusts, they are dealt with in paragraphs 17-18of the draft White Paper. For the rest, they are dealt with in a separate draft statement of Government policy which has been prepared in the Treasury and approved by the Home Affairs Committee. This draft is attached to this note as appendix B.3. On behalf of the Home Affairs Committee, and in agreement with theChancellor of the Exchequer, I invite the Cabinet:  (a) to agree that the attached White Paper should now be presented toParliament;(b) to approve the issue at the same time of the attached draft statement aboutamendment of the Trustee List.S.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,13th July, 1955.47949a

introductory. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the Report(Cmd. 8710) of the Committee under the Chairmanship of LordNathan on the Law and Practice Relating to Charitable Trusts inEngland and Wales. This memorandum considers the problem underthe headings of the Committee&apos;s Report, sets out the Governmentsconclusions and explains the nature of the legislation which theyconsider to be required. For convenience of reference the numbersof the relevant paragraphs of the Report are given in the margin.The Definition of Charity(Chapter 3 of the Report)2.   No clear statutory definition of &quot; charity &quot; now exists.   The Cmd. 8710,decision whether or not a trust is charitable depends on a body of Paras,case law, which in its turn rests on &quot; the spirit and intendment&quot; of 120-140the preamble to a statute of Elizabeth I.  The Committee considerthat the existing content of the term &quot; charity &quot; is substantially right;but that it would be well to provide a new statutory definition, havingmuch the same effect but no longer resting on the obsolete statute of Elizabeth I, provided that the existing case law can be preserved.The Government have much sympathy with this proposal, but they believe that it is not practicable (judgments given by the Court sincethe Committee reported have made this clearer than before). Any newdefinition that could be devised would be new in substance as wellas form; and if the case law is to be preserved, with it must be preserved, implicitly or explicitly, the preamble of the statute ofElizabeth I on which it is based.3. Therefore, the choice is between leaving things as they areand adopting a new definition which is different in substance. TheGovernment agree with the Committee that there is no reason to change the present content of charity and therefore they do . not propose that a fresh statutory definition should be enacted.The Recording of Charitable Trusts(Chapter 4 of the Report)4 It is accepted that the basic details relating tc all charitable para- 150,trusts with endowments falling within their jurisdiction should be recorded with the Charity Commissioners or the Ministry ofEducation. It is desirable to lay on the trustees of such trusts an rjtexpress statutory obligation to record with the Commissioners orthe Ministry such details as may be prescribed. If a founder wisheshis anonymity to be preserved, that can be arranged.Penalty for Non-Compliance5.   The Government do not consider that the present sanction for Paeas.failure to furnish information to the Commissioners, of committal 162-166for contempt of court, should be abolished and its place taken by aprovision rendering each trustee personally liable to a penalty347949 b* 2
recoverable in a court of summary jurisdiction. It might causesome resentment if this form of procedure were introduced, and itis not thought to be necessary. The ultimate sanction of committalshould therefore be retained.Central and Local RecordsParas. 6.   The Government agree that there should be central classified167 -174 records, but not that the Charity Commissioners and the ministry should be under a statutory obligation to send copies to localauthorities as a matter of course. This disagreement follows fromthe different view which the Government have formed of the part to be played by local authorities and also from practical considera-tions. The central records will be available to local authoritiesand to voluntary bodies, and the Government share the Committee&apos;shope that some voluntary bodies will prepare central and local lists of all charities providing welfare services of one kind or another.Powers of Enquiry(Chapter 5 of the Report)7. The Government agree with the general conclusion of theCommittee that the existing powers of enquiry are wide enough; that,broadly speaking, they have been exercised on the right lines; that much could be done by voluntary bodies to encourage efficient administration of charitable trusts; and that it should be the function of the Charity Commissioners and the Ministry to stimulate and encourage work of this kind rather than to undertake it themselves.8. It is not accepted that accounts submitted to the CharityCommissioners and the Ministry should always be audited. the accounts of large trusts are usually audited in any case; audit wouldbe of little value for the smaller ones and would impose anunwarrantable expense on them. Nor is it considered necessary toimpose a standard form of accounts; the Charity commissioners and the Ministry have found no difficulty in persuading trustees torender accounts which are intelligible and adequate for their purpose.9. The Commissioners and the Ministry should be empoweredto permit individual charities to send in accounts less frequently than once a year, if occasional scrutiny would suffiee.\l0. The Government agree that the publication of accounts ofall trusts is unnecessary. The accounts should be available for inspection, as at present; the proposal that copies of accounts shouldbe sent on by the Charity Commission and the Ministry to the localauthority concerned is not accepted.11. It is agreed that, if a person is called upon to travel morethan 10 miles for the purpose of being examined, his expenses shouldbe tendered to him.Official Custodians(Chapter 6 of the Report)Para. 229 12.   It is agreed that the present system of vesting land in the: Official Trustee of Charity Lands and securities in the OfficialTrustees of Charitable Funds is advantageous, and that its use shouldbe encouraged.   But it is not considered that charity lands andParas.194-197Paras.20O-201Paras.202-203Paras.207-208Para. 211
securities should be so. vested as a statutory requirement and by Paras,operation of law. 230-23113.   It is agreed that the facilities of the Official Trustees should Para. 232be available on application and free of charge to all trustees ofcharitable funds whether or not their assets fall within the jurisdiction.14. The changes in title which the Committee propose for the Para. 237Official Trustees are accepted.Control of Dealings in Land; Mortmain; Charitable Uses(Chapter 7 of the Report)15.   The Government accept the proposals of the Committee paras.about the control of dealings in charity land. 239-25216. The Committee propose that charitable trusts should cease to be subject to the law of mortmain.  This is accepted; and, as thelaw of mortmains other applications serve little, if any, useful purposeat the present day, there is a strong case for its entire repeal. Itis also agreed that the law relating to the recording of assurances ofland for charitable uses should be repealed.Paras.262-274Range of Trustee Investments(Chapter 8 of the Report)17. The Government consider that a distinction should be Paras,drawn between the arrangements relating to Charitable Trusts- and 289-293those relating to other trusts. Where charities are concerned thereis room for some relaxation of the procedure for widening the range of investment. Hitherto, the Court, on application by trustees ofcharitable trusts, has, on occasion, given them wider powers of investment, subject to appropriate safeguards. The government consider that powers should be sought for the Charity Com-missioners and the Ministry to do the same. They would have complete discretion in the matter; but, for the guidance of trustees,it would be made clear in general terms what safeguards andconditions they would require before granting wider powers of investment, and how far in suitable cases they would beprepared to widen these powers. The Government propose to dealwith the wider question of amending the Trustee Act, 1925, and theposition of non-charitable trusts in a statement which will be madeseparately. \18.  The Government agree that trustees should be able to Para. 294acquire freeholds either for use or as an authorised investmentwithout  having  to  obtain  the  consent  of  the   scheme-makingauthorities, but think that the acquisition of leaseholds shouldcontinue to be subject to their prior approval.The Alteration of Trusts(Chapter 9 of the Report)19. The Government believe that the Committee have under- paras.estimated the extent to which charitable trusts can be altered under 299-316the present law. When the Court makes a scheme, it can go as farfrom the original purposes of the charity as the circumstances of thecase require; and in some recorded cases it has gone much further than the Report of the Committee would suggest. But, though thecy-pres doctrine is elastic, it is not clear, without recourse to theSi
Court, how far it can be extended. This is dealt with in paragraph 24below. There are other respects in which some relaxation is needed,particularly in the definition of antecedent circumstances in whichschemes may be made. On the other hand, the Government do notin all respects go as far as the Committee, particularly where the initiation of schemes is concerned. They place more emphasis onthe individual responsibility and initiative of the charitable trusteesand on their duty to carry out the terms of the trust so far aspossible. This does not mean that the Government consider that noreform is needed; but they believe that it must come by persuasion.The Charity Commissioners and the Ministry of Education can helpin this work of persuasion, as they have done in the past, but theirwords will carry more weight if they remain as they are at present, thefriend and adviser of trustees and not their master. Much good canbe done if the various voluntary bodies concerned with charities andwith the social services take the initiative in persuading, enquiringand stirring up local interest. &apos; &apos;20. The Government do not consider that the jurisdiction underthe Charitable Trusts Acts should go so far as the present jurisdiction of the Minister of Education under the Endowed Schools Acts. they see no reason to restrict the latter in any way, but they regard it lessas a model for general legislation than as special means to meet specialcircumstances (in this, similar to the treatment of hospital endowmentsunder Section 7 of the National Health Service Act, 1946). It istherefore considered desirable to retain the Endowed Schools juris-diction, side by side with the Charitable Trusts jurisdiction, without making any changes of substance in the former, though opportunity should certainly be taken to simplify the procedure, to remove minoranomalies and to consolidate the legislation. The rest of thismemorandum, therefore, deals only with the reform of the CharitableTrusts Acts.Circumstances in which Schemes may be madeParas. 21.   The   Government  agree  with  the  Committee that  the318-319 conditions which must exist before the objects of a trust may be changed should be stated explicitly. It is considered that this shouldbe done in such a way as to make it clear when scheme-makingauthorities, including the High Court, can alter the objects of a trustwhich does not carry out the founders intention. The cases to be covered should include the following:  \(a) with changing circumstances (including changes in the scope ofpublic or local services), the category of the communitydesignated as beneficiaries has dwindled, or is hard to identify,or. is so defined as not to correspond to contemporaryconditions;(6) the purposes of the charity are obsolete or insignificantcompared with the size of the endowment;(c) the endowment is no longer of any real use to beneficiaries;(d) the geographical area of benefit needs redefinition; and(e) the endowment can be more effectively or economically usedin conjunction with some other like endowment.,22. The Commissioners and the Ministry, according to existing practice, would not alter objects which are related to religiousdoctrines without the consent of the congregation or religious bodyconcerned. &apos;
23. As at present, there should be power to make schemes forthe purpose of altering the administrative provisions of the trust,without changing its objects.Limitation on Power to Alter Objects of Trusts24. The Government agree in general with the recommendations paras.of the Committee, but wish to place special emphasis on the area 320-325and on the category of persons which the founder wished to benefit.Subject to that, the scheme-making authority should have as wide a discretion as possible, once it is necessary to alter the objects of a trust at all, to apply the endowment as may be best for the purposeof effecting the aims of the founder in the changed circumstances.25. The Court and the Commissioners already have certain specific statutory powers to vary trusts in particular directions. these should be maintained and in one case extended: the CharitableTrusts Act, 1914, enables them to extend the benefits of a charitywhich is restricted to any parish within a municipal borough, to thewhole or any part of that borough and adjacent parishes; this power should be applied to civil parishes and county districts as well asboroughs and should be extended to the Ministry of Education.26. The authority when making a scheme should have power toamalgamate a charity with one or more other charities or to dividecharities.Period of Immunity from Alteration27.   The Government agree that the objects of a trust should paras.not be altered (except by the Court) within thirty-five years of its 326-329foundation, without an application by the trustees; the donor, ifliving, would doubtless be consulted, but his consent should not bea statutory requirement.Initiation of Schemes28. The Government believe that the power to make proposals paras.initiating a scheme should normally be confined to the trustees of 330-333the charity concerned. But the central authorities should be ableto proceed with a scheme without application by, or consent of, the trustees, though this would be done only in very exceptional cases.This power would be exercised by the Minister of Education and bythe Commissioners, but, in the case of the latter, should be subjectto the approval of the responsible Minister (see paragraph 42 below).The existing power of the Attorney-General to apply to the court to make a scheme should be retained. In the Governments viewno other body, should be empowered to. propose a scheme: inparticular, it is thought to be wrong to put the appropriate local Para. 332authority in the same position as the trustees. Local authoritiesshould have no independent powers; their proper course is to persuade the trustees to ask for a scheme. If the trustees will not do so, the local authority can ask the scheme-making authority totake independent action; but it is hoped that such cases will be rare.29. The Government do not think that any body other than thescheme-making authority should have the right to insist upon a localpublic enquiry. At present the scheme-making authority decideswhether or not to hold a local public enquiry: this has worked well,and the Government see no need to vary it.
The Scheme-making AuthorityPara, 340 30.   It is agreed that the High Court, the Charity commissioners and the Minister of Education should, as at present, be the scheme-making authorities in relation to both original and cy-pres schemes;and that, if a charity is being converted from educational to non-educational uses, the scheme should be made by the Commissioners,Para. 341 antjs vjce vers(lt by the Minister, though in each case theconcurrence of the other authority will be necessary.Para. 342 31    jt fs agreed that the existing scheme-making powers ofcounty courts should be abolished.Para. 342 32,   The Committee proposed that the powers of the Chancery-Division of the High Court should remain unchanged. TheGovernment think that, with the exception of the power to amendenactments (sec paragraph 35 below), the powers of the Court mustbe co-extensive with those of the Commissioners and the Ministerof Education.33. The power of the Court to determine when a scheme needs to be made must not be altered; this power is exercised, on theapplication of the trustees or persons having the endowment, either (a) before the charity has come into operation, as in the case ofa will, when the Commissioners (or the Ministry) may nothave heard of it; or(b) once the charity is in operation, when the leave of theCommissioners (or the Ministry) is required for theapplication.At present the Court itself, by Order by way of scheme or by Orderdirecting the settlement of a scheme in Chambers, either deals withthe matter itself or directs that a scheme should be prepared by theparties for its approval. The Court should have power at discretion to direct as an alternative that the Charity Commissioners or theMinistry should prepare and put a scheme into effect within suchlimits and for such purposes as the Court has declared. TheCommissioners will be aware of other charities operating for the like purposes in the locality of the new charity, or of other circumstances having bearing upon its convenient administration,and these factors unknown to the Court should have their due weightin the framing of the scheme.Control of the Scheme-making PowerParas. X34.   The Government agree with the Committee that appeals344-357 against schemes made by the Commissioners (or the Minister) shouldlie to the Chancery Division of the High Court and not to Parliament.As at present, a right of appeal should be available not only to the trustees but to any other interested body or any member of thepublic authorised by the Attorney-General. It is assumed thatappeals will, as hitherto, be rare. Moreover, as the Committee pointout, since the Weir Hospital case it has been the settled practice ofthe Court not to interfere with a scheme settled by the Commissionersunless they have acted ultra vires or the scheme contains somethingwrong in principle or in law. As at present, the consent of the attorney-General or the Commissioners or the Minister of education should be required for an appeal by the trustees, whatever the grossincome of the charity.
Amendment of Statutes and Charters35. It is agreed that the Commissioners and the Minister of Paras.Education should have power to amend trusts based on private or 358-359local Acts or on subordinate legislation, but it is difficult to draw alogical line between these forms of legislation and public Acts.There are public and general Acts governing particular charitieswhich it would be quite unsuitable for the scheme-making authorityto amend in the ordinary exercise of their jurisdiction (for example,general hospital endowments are governed by the National health service Act, 1946); but there are other Acts whose status as public and general Acts arises from mere accidents of history. It istherefore proposed that the Commissioners and the Minister ofEducation should be given power to amend any Act of parliament and any subordinate legislation made under any such Act, providedthat the scheme is embodied in a statutory instrument which willitself be subject to the control of Parliament.36. It may be necessary on occasions to have an Act ofParliament for schemes which propose some alteration of the objectsor scope of a charity wider than the law permits, or which otherwisego beyond the provision of the existing law.37. Schemes which involve the revision of a Royal Charter Para. 359could not come into effect until the Charter had been amended; inorder to avoid the need for supplemental Charters, it is intended toprovide that such amendments to Charters as are needed to carryout schemes made by the Commissioners or the Minister ofEducation can be made by Order in Council, even if the originalCharter does not (as some already do) provide for amendment inthat way.Scheme-making Procedure38.   It is agreed that the procedure is generally satisfactory. Para 360though there will be details in which it would be hoped that it couldbe simplified if and when amending legislation is introduced.39. The Committee&apos;s suggestion of a streamlined form, of Paras,procedure, to be used in some minor cases, is attractive, but the 361-363Government do not consider that it should be adopted. It is difficultto define in general terms classes of cases which will not becontentious. For local and special reasons, even small alterationsmay sometimes be contentious in particular cases. To dispense with local publication of a scheme would mean little saving either of time or of expense. The Government feel that it is better to preserve the present safeguard of full publicity.The Central Authority(Chapter 10 of the Report)The Charity Commissioners and the Minister of Education40.   The Government agree that the Minister of Education Para- 369should, as at present, have jurisdiction to make schemes affectingeducational trusts.Quasi-Educational Trusts41.   It is considered that the balance of advantage is in favour para. 370of maintaining the transfer  to  the Minister of Education  of jurisdiction over quasi-educational trusts which was made under
the Minister of Education (Transfer of Functions) Order, 1949(S.I. 1949, No. 1845). The Government do not think that it isnecessary to provide that no scheme for these trusts should be made without the consent of the trustees, but it is clear from paragraph 28that a scheme would be made without the consent of the trusteesonly in most exceptional circumstances.A Minister for the Charity CommissionParas. 42.   The Government accept the recommendation that a Minister374-376 should be appointed to represent the Commissioners in parliament and in the Government with power to approve rules and regulations made by the Charity Commissioners but, subject to paragraph 28above, to give them general guidance only, not direction. It isproposed that the Home Secretary should undertake these functions.The office of Parliamentary Commissioner would be abolished.Constitution of the Charity CommissionParas. 43.  The Government do not accept  the proposal  of the377-379 Committee that the Commission should be reconstituted as a part-time body of &quot; men and women of standing in public and charitableaffairs.&quot; Under the Governments proposals the Commission would remain a body whose primary task was to deal with proposalsinitiated by trustees. It is considered that a whole-time commission with a predominantly legal composition is the right body to carryout this task, but that it could be usefully strengthened by theintroduction of a non-legal element. The Government, therefore,contemplate that in future there should be three non-ParliamentaryCommissioners, of whom two would be persons with legalqualifications.44.   Hitherto the two legal Commissioners have been barristers.In future it is proposed that solicitors also shall be eligible.Staff RequirementsParas. 45.   Probably  any   reform  would  mean  that   the   Charity381-388 Commissioners and the Ministry would need more staff. In presenttimes it is not easy to envisage a large increase of staff in any office,and this must be a factor in determining the pace at which reformscan be carried out. But it is plain that, to the extent that a new taskis undertaken, staff must be provided to carry it out.FeesPara. 389 46.   It is accepted that fees should not be charged to charitiesfor the services made available to them by the Commissioners andthe Ministry.Exceptions from the Jurisdiction(Chapter 11 of the Report)Para. 392 47.   Under the Governments proposals, the implications ofexception from the jurisdiction are naturally rather different fromthose described in paragraph 392 of the Committee&apos;s Report. TheGovernment^ proposals mean that (a) the trustees of excepted charities would be under no obligationto register details of the charity;(b) they would not be under an obligation to lodge accounts;
(c) they would not be subject to the supervisory powers of theCommissioners except in the cases mentioned in paragraphs53-54 below, where it is proposed that the Commissioners andthe Minister of Education should retain their general powersof enquiry set out in Section 9 of the Act of 1853; and(d) they would be able to obtain authoritative opinion and advice,when required, from the Commissioners.48. It is proposed that it should be made clear that the provisionsof the Charitable Trusts Acts can be extended in whole or in part,either permanently Or ad hoc, to an excepted charity or to particularparts of its endowment, at the request and with the consent of the trustees. Schemes of any kind could be made for excepted charities,at the request of the trustees and with their consent, without affectingthe excepted status of the trust (unless the provisions of the schemethemselves removed the grounds for exception). This is contrary tothe opinion mentioned in paragraph 415 of the Committee&apos;s Report para. 415that, if an excepted body asked for a scheme under the Acts it wouldgive the Commissioners (or Minister of Education) permanentjurisdiction over the trust concerned.49.   It is agreed that the following should continue to be exceptedfrom the jurisdiction University bodies.Paras.400-418Paras.419-420Paras.423-431Paras.432-433Paras.434-436Paras.137-438Cathedral or collegiate churches.The Church Commissioners.The British Museum.Charitable funds of any Society registered under the friendly societies Act, 1896, or under the Industrial andProvident Societies Act, 1893.Funds or property of missionary societies not having fundsor property in England or Wales.Universities and Schools50.   The   Committee   draw   attention   to   several   particular Paras,problems which arise in the case of university bodies and make some 400-418tentative suggestions for their solution.   The Government agree in substance with almost all their recommendations but believe that theycan be put into effect by other and simpler means.   These shouldbe discussed with the universities and colleges concerned, and alsowhether it is necessary to retain the powers of supervision overcertain of their investments and land transactions which are atpresent exercised under the Universities and College Estates Act,1925.51.   Schools  would be subject to  the jurisdiction of the Paras.Minister of Education broadly to the same extent as they are at 439-447present, subject to certain modifications which will be discussed withthem. . . -t Further Exceptions52. Since the Act of 1853 experience has shown that in somekinds i of charities supervision by the Commissioners serves no useful purpose. It is proposed that the list of exceptions should be extendedso as to recognise this fact.      :U
53. First there are local trusts, in various forms, for the benefitof religion and religious congregations. The congregation looks after its own, and the Commissioners&apos; work is largely duplication. It isproposed that the present exception in favour of registered places of worship should be enlarged by excepting the following classes oftrusts from the jurisdiction (a) trusts whose endowment is a building used as a place ofworship, or as a residence for a minister of religion;(b) trusts for buying or erecting such a building;(c) trusts for endowing or augmenting the stipend of a ministerof religion.. 54. The Commissioners should, nevertheless, retain their general powers of enquiry into these trusts and they would be able to help them, like all excepted trusts, by giving authoritative opinion and advice (paragraph 47 (d) above) and by making schemes at therequest and with the consent of the trustees (paragraph 48 above).55. It is proposed that trust property held by a hospital authoritysubject to the provisions of Section 1, Section 59 or Section 60 of theNational Health Service Act, 1946, should be excepted from thejurisdiction.56. There are a number of other charities which are subject to close supervision by Government departments and are sometimesadministered by them (e.g., certain service charities vested in theAdmiralty and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General; andother national institutions whose position is similar to that of theBritish Museum) where the additional supervision by the Commis-sioners serves no useful purpose. It is proposed that, in order to dealwith such cases, the Commissioners and the Minister of education should have power by order to except from the jurisdiction any namedcharity or class of charities.Plain and Mixed CharitiesParas- 57.   The confusion surrounding the subject of plain and mixed451-482 charities has been due mainly to the fact that while the law exceptsfrom the jurisdiction any donation or bequest (to a mixed charity)which may be legally applied by the trustees or other governing bodyas income in aid of voluntary subscriptions, it has not excepted theproperty given on precisely identical trusts to a charity which, at thetime when the gift is made, is not a mixed charity. There have beenvarious subsidiary difficulties, for example, the difficulty of knowingwhen a charity had ceased to be plain by acquiring some propertyother than voluntary contributions, and the difficulty, felt moreespecially by the Committee, that owing to changes in the nature ofthe property owned by a charity, the charity can move in or out ofthe jurisdiction.58. The Government believe that it is impossible to simplify thelaw, in the sense suggested by the Committee, to prevent charitiesmoving in or out of the jurisdiction, but that it is possible so to simplify the law that the main difficulty mentioned above is obviated.59. The Government propose that the law should be amended so that any property which a charity may possess for the time being on a trust which authorises the trustees of their own motion to resort to the capital and spend it as income, would be excepted from thejurisdiction of the Commissioners or the Minister.
60. Such an amendment of the law would wholly or mainlyremove the difficulties which have troubled lawyers and others in thepast as to whether any given charity was at the critical date plain ormixed, or whether any given part of the property of such a charitywas excepted. It would merely be necessary to look to the stateof a particular piece of property and the trusts affecting it at any given time and decide whether the trusts affecting the property at thattime authorised the trustees, of their own motion, to realise it andexpend the proceeds as income. If the answer was &quot; yes,&quot; then theproperty would be excepted at that time; if the answer was &quot; no,&quot;it would be subject to the jurisdiction. The Commissioners and theMinister of Education would be empowered to determine at any given time whether any particular piece of property is within or outsidethe jurisdiction.61. It will be apparent that the emphasis would remain on thetrusts affecting any particular item of property of any charity and notupon the nature of the charity itself, so that there would be no need to give exception to a charity as distinct from its property or partof its property. In other words, there would be no need to retain the present law as to the division between plain and mixed charities.The point is of importance when considering the requirement of registration; trustees and the Commissioners and the Ministry mustknow clearly what has to be registered.Imperfect Trust Instruments(Chapter 12 of the Report)62. An Act to validate existing imperfect trust instruments sofar as is expedient has already been passed. It is agreed that it isnot expedient to attempt to validate imperfect trust instrumentscoming into existence in the future.Part III of the Kepori63. This part of the report is mainly concerned with the way inwhich the proposed new powers would be exercised. The Govern-ment*s approach to the whole question differs in many respects from that of the Committee; in particular, they put a differentemphasis on the respective powers and duties of trustees and public authorities. Itjollows from this that the Government do not approveall of the suggestions of the Committee in Part III. They commenthere only on such points as touch on legislation. The other,administrative, questions should be considered by the appropriate authorities, in the light of the Government^ general policy, whenthe law has been altered.The Shape and Organisation of Charitable Trusts(Chapter 13 of the Report)64.   The Government think that the Committee&apos;s proposal for Paras,unified trust funds is valuable, but that it must be left to private 555-557initiative to found unified funds such as are proposed; and trusteesthemselves must decide whether their endowments should be put in them. It would be possible under the existing law to arrange for this,
but a heavy responsibility would rest on the trustees who put theirinvestments into such a unified trust fund if anything went wrong:they have no cover if they delegate the control of their funds to anyonebut the Official Trustees. It is proposed that new legislation should provide statutory authorisation for trustees to put their endowmentswith any unified trust fund approved for this purpose by theCommissioners or the Minister of Education. The legislation wouldalso provide for bodies such as colleges, societies, &amp;c, to establishunified trust funds with the Commissioners&apos; or Ministers consent (this can be done at present, but only by way of scheme, or under special powers relating only to certain universities and colleges).Para. 567 65.   The Government agree that trustees of various charities,whether operating in the same area or having a similar purpose,should be enabled to spend money on common services or on working out a scheme for merger, provided the Commissioners or the Ministerof Education approve.Paras. 66.   Practical difficulties make it impossible for the Government573-575 to accept the Committee&apos;s proposal that the approval of theappropriate authority should be obtained for any substantial changein the Memorandum and Articles of Association of a company, being a charity, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1948, otherwise than under Section 19.Parochial Charities(Chapter 14 of the Report)Para. 589 67.   It is agreed that the relevant provisions of the LocalGovernment Act, 1894, should stand, subject to the accounts being sent to the council in parishes which have a parish council, insteadPara. 590 of the chairman of the parish meeting. The publication of the namesPara. 587 Qf tne beneficiaries of dole charities is a relic from Poor Law days and it is agreed that it should be discontinued: indeed there is noreason why they should be made open to public inspection. TheGovernment do not think it necessary that the accounts which arelaid annually before the parish meeting should be audited (seeparagraph 8 above).Paras. 68.   The Government agree that local authorities have a useful590-595 part to play in reviewing local charities as indeed have other,unofficial, local bodies. County and county borough councils arealready empowered, by the Charity Inquiries (Expenses) Act, 1892,to move the Charity Commissioners to make such enquiries and tocontribute towards their expenses. County and county borough councils should also be empowered, subject to the consent of the trustees and in consultation with them, to carry out reviews themselves,at their expense, of such non-ecclesiastical charities in their areas as are within the jurisdiction of the Charity Commission; but they shouldnot be armed with any compulsory powers for this purpose, nor would any recommendation by a local authority become effectiveunless the Commissioners made it so by means of a scheme which, &apos;in all but very exceptional cases, would need the consent of the trustees (see paragraph 28 above). In special cases county and countyborough councils should be authorised to delegate their powers ofenquiry to other local authorities. Reviews of this kind should,as the Committee say, be by way of conference with trustees, not of formal enquiry,
Common Good Trusts(Chapter 15 of the Report)69. The Government agree that it would be advantageous if local common good trusts were established more widely than atpresent, and that they should be spontaneous in origin and unofficialin character. It is proposed that the title &quot; Common Good Trust&quot;should be protected by requiring the permission of the Commissionersfor its use. However, it is not agreed that national common goodtrusts should be subsidised or set up by the Government. This seemsto be essentially a matter for private initiative. There would in any event have been serious objection to transferring bono vacantia to national common good trusts.Simplification of the Law(Chapter 17 of the Report) .70.  The Government agree with the Committee that the statute Paras,law needs revision.   But the way in which the revision is to be 668-675undertaken, and the ultimate form of the legislation, are not questionswhich can be considered from the point of view of charities alone.Paras.608-611Paras.6J5-619Para. 617v

APPENDIX draft STATEMENT ON AMENDMENT OF THE TRUSTEE LIST1. The Government have given careful consideration to the suggestion of theCommittee on the Law and Practice relating to Charitable Trusts (the NathanCommittee) that the range of investment authorised for trustees of all kinds shouldbe extended. In particular, the Committee suggested that the range shouldcomprise (subject to certain safeguards) the debentures and stock and shares(including equity stock and shares) of financial, industrial and commercialcompanies quoted on the London Stock Exchange. The Committee also suggestedthat trustees should be permitted to invest in authorised securities standing at apremium.2. In the opinion of the Government the proposal for a general extension ofthe range of investment to include equity stocks and shares is open to serious objection. The very considerations which in some circumstances would lead to theenhancement of the trust funds might in other circumstances lead to considerablelosses and the Government has to recognise the possibility that the inclusion withinthe Trustee List of securities hitherto excluded might be regarded by the general public as conveying a measure of official guarantee of their suitability for investment. The object of the Trustee List is to ensure the safety of the trust funds in cases where, for example, the settlor has not thought fit to give a wider powerof investment. Its purpose is not to offer wider opportunities to trustees toexercise the skill in investment which the management of investment in equitysecurities continually requires. The List also affords a protection for trustees whohave to balance the interests of tenants for life against those of remaindermen.Furthermore, trustees of existing trusts can already obtain extended powers of investment either by agreement with the beneficiaries (in certain cases) or by leave of the High Court. The Governments conclusion is that any general extension ofthe powers of investment of trustees would not be desirable.3.   As has been outlined in paragraphs ...... of Command Paper ............the Government have it in mind to take powers to simplify the procedure by which trustees of charitable trusts can obtain wider powers of investment (on application to the Ministry of Education and the Charity Commissioners). Theyhave given careful thought to the feasibility of introducing some similar new procedure in the case of non-charitable trusts but have reluctantly reached theconclusion that this would be impracticable. In the case of non-charitable truststhere are\commonly divergent interests, the pattern of which is very varied, andconsiderations of a nature with which only the Courts can properly deal often arise.Such difficulties are generally not involved in the case of charitable trusts, whichare virtually all perpetuities.4. On the other hand, there are some minor amendments to the Trustee Listwhich the Government propose to make. First as the Nathan Committeesuggested the removal of the anomalous restrictions on investment in certainstocks standing at a premium. Secondly and this is at present the subject ofdiscussion with the representatives of local authorities the removal of someanomalies regarding local authority stocks and mortgages. Thirdly the inclusionof sterling securities of the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development.The Government propose at a convenient opportunity to introduce legislation tocarry these proposals into effect.
