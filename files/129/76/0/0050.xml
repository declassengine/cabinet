Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1955SECRET Copy No. 74CP. (55) 10012th August, 1955CABINETDISARMAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRecent developments the United Nations Disarmament Sub-Committee which had been meeting in London since 25th February adjourned on 18th May, shortly after the soviet delegation presented their latest disarmament proposals. It is due to meet again in New York on 29th August.2. Meanwhile, the Geneva Conference has given &quot; disarmament&quot; a newimpetus. The Prime Minister put forward a proposal for a practical exercise ininspection, to cover some of the forces at present facing each other in Europe;President Eisenhower put forward a proposal for exchanging blueprints ofmilitary establishments and for aerial surveys of the United States and soviet union; M. Faure put forward a proposal for a form of budgetary control of disarmament; Marshal Bulganin repeated the substance of the Soviet proposalsof 10th May. The directive issued at the close of the Conference stated that thefour Heads of Government agreed to work together to develop an acceptablesystem of disarmament through the Disarmament Sub-Committee; to instruct theirrepresentatives in this Sub-Committee to take account of the views and proposalsadvanced at Geneva, and to instruct their Foreign Ministers to take account ofthese proposals as well as the proceedings in the Disarmament Sub-Committee.Future Course of Discussion3. When the Disarmament Sub-Committee resumes, the Minister of State,Mr. Nutting, will represent the United Kingdom. The session should last abouta fortnight. The Sub-Committee will then report to its parent body, the united nations Disarmament Commission, which will in turn report to the United nations general Assembly. Both these bodies will debate the problem in public. Theywill almost certainly authorise the Sub-Committee to continue its efforts, thoughit can hardly meet until after the Conference of Foreign Ministers at Geneva,which is due to open on 27th October.Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs policy. We are at present reconsidering our disarmament policy in certainfundamental respects. In the first place, the existence of nuclear weapons seemsmore likely to preserve than to threaten the peace of the world. Secondly, we nowrealise that no known control system can ensure adequate control either over thestockpiles of nuclear weapons already existing in the world or over new productionof fissile material. The United States Government are also reconsidering theirpolicy. While they have decided that total nuclear disarmament appears to be impracticable, they have not yet reached any conclusion as to what degree of nuclear disarmament or control will be possible. The Soviet Government alsorecognise the problem of control and have indeed drawn attention to it in their proposals of 10th May.5.   Our problem is thus to decide what we ought to say or do. It is temptingto suggest that we should concentrate on conventional disarmament which is48570
easier to control and suits our book. Unfortunately, conventional disarmamentalone has little attraction for the Russians whose chief concern has always been to remove the nuclear threat. As a first step we are trying to determine whichaspects of disarmament (both conventional and nuclear) can be effectivelyr supervised. It will, in any case, be difficult to arrive at final conclusions on thesefundamental questions until we know more about the trend of American thinking.So far, the Americans have produced no firm views.6. It would have suited us and the Americans better if the next session ofthe Disarmament Sub-Committee could have been postponed. But the united nations calendar makes this impossible. We must therefore decide what line the Minister of State should take in the Sub-Committee on 29th August. his principal task will be to balance the record before the proceedings are published.At present the Russians appear to have the initiative as a result of their proposalsof 10th May. We also have to show that the Western Powers are not only sincerein their desire for disarmament but are approaching this problem constructively.I suggest that the Minister of State should take the following line.7. Mr. Nutting will draw attention to the Prime Ministers proposal for apractical inspection scheme in Europe. He can do this because the directive fromthe Geneva Conference requires our representative to take account of the views and proposals advanced by the Heads of Government. He will not attempt todevelop or embroider the proposal since the details of any inspection system mustbe worked out with Supreme Allied Commander Europe and with the north atlantic Treaty Organisation Governments before it can be seriously discussed with the Russians. There is no time for such consultations before theSub-Committee meets. He will, however, emphasise that the purpose of theproposal is to enable experience to be gained in the working of a control system,which experience may lead to a growth of confidence.8. He will then seek to concentrate discussion on the specific problem ofcontrol of disarmament. Here he will base his remarks on the Prime Minister^statement at Geneva that &quot; no disarmament plan can be acceptable which does not contain a system of inspection and reporting which is adequate to support everyphase of the plan.&quot; He will urge the Sub-Committee to concentrate its efforts ondevising a system of control for the efficient supervision of all disarmament. Themain difficulty concerns nuclear disarmament and the Soviet Union has alreadyrecognised this difficulty in its proposals of 10th May. They say that &quot; there arepossibilities beyond the reach of international control for evading this control andfor organising the clandestine manufacture of atomic and hydrogen weapons evenif there is a formal agreement on international control.&quot; We must try to get theRussians to recognise their inconsistency in pressing for total nuclear disarmamentwhen they themselves have said that there is no known way of enforcing it. If wecan induce them to agree that we are all confronted by the same dilemma, we shallhave widened the areas of agreement between us.9. Our past proposals, and particularly the Anglo-French Plan which provides for complete nuclear disarmament, all depended on a water-tight systemof control. Since it now seems impossible to devise such a system, we cannot continue to reaffirm our support for these past proposals without frankly admittingthe difficulty which faces us all. This applies particularly to the sections of theAnglo-French Plan which refer to the elimination of nuclear weapons. If theMinister of State is pressed in the Sub-Committee, he would deny that we haveretreated from this plan but would go on to emphasise that it depends on thecreation of an absolutely water-tight control system and he would emphasise thatthe Soviet Union itself has drawn attention to the increasing difficulty of creatingsuch a system.President Eisenhower&apos;s Proposal10. President eisenhower&apos;s proposal was for an exchange between the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union of blueprints of military installations and of aerialsurveys. Recently Marshal Bulganin indicated that the Soviet Union has seriousdoubts about this plan although it has not been rejected. In its present form it doesnot involve the United Kingdom directly. Until we learn more of Americanintentions, we shall avoid any definite statement of attitude towards it apart from
M. Faure&apos;s Proposal11. M. Faure&apos;s proposal was for the establishment of an international fund to which States would make a fixed financial contribution to be used for the benefitof under-developed countries. States would, in theory, reduce their armamentsexpenditure by the amount of their contribution to this fund and M. Faure claimed that a real measure of disarmament would be achieved because no State would be willing to maintain its present rate of expenditure on armaments if it had to bear theburden of contributing to such an international fund. This may be true of the democracies, I am not so sure about the totalitarian regimes. In any case sucha scheme would have to be supported by other sorts of control, such as ground and air inspections, if we were to have any assurance that States had reduced theirarmaments expenditure by the prescribed amount. This could only be after a comprehensive disarmament treaty had come into force. Nor do I think that theChancellor of the Exchequer would welcome this method of earmarking any savings which disarmament might achieve. However, as this scheme has specious politicalattractions, I suggest that Mr. Nutting might let somebody else kill it or smother it.Recommendation12. I seek the approval of the Cabinet for the general line which I proposethat the Minister of State should take. He will be going to New York on24th August for discussion with the Americans, French and Canadians and willtry to work out an agreed line of approach before the Sub-Committee meets on29th August.H. M.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,11th August, 1955.welcoming it, as the Prime Minister did at Geneva, as another example of a&quot; practical scheme &quot; for developing confidence.
