CLEAN AIR bill memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer set out &quot;here my views on the question whether the exchequer should pay three-eighths or one half of the cost of converting houses tomake them smokeless.&quot;2.       The Beaver Committee (paragraph 85) &quot;thought it would be reasonable for the Exchequer to bear 50 per cent of the total cost andthat the local authority should decide in each case how much of the balancethey should contribute and how much should be borne by the owner. &quot;3.       The Bill as drafted provides in effect that 37^ per cent of thiscost should be borne by the Exchequer, and that l&quot;2j per cent (or more,at local authorities&apos; option) should be borne by the local authority.4.       The Treasury was originally persuaded to accept the37^ per cent as the basis&apos;of the proposals for the Bill on the grounds &quot;thatthis is the provision made in 1949 for grant for similar work on houses for improvement and conversion under the Housing Acts.    I understandthat the Minister of Housing and Local Government does not accept thisanalogy as being relevant here.5.        If this&quot;analogy is not accepted, it would seem to me that the &quot;appropriate question is whether 3 7^- per cent is not a disproportionatelyheavy burden on &quot;the Exchequer.    The advantages of this legislation willunquestionably be predominantly local;  the implementation of the poHcywill depend upon local initiative, and the economic advantages (e. g. savingexpenditure on laundry, painting and decorating, and reduction &quot;of &quot;deterioration of buildings, metals, furnishings and materials generally)will accrue to the businesses, property owners and residents in theselocalities.6.       I cannot accept a burden on the Exchequer of more than3.7.a per cent for this grant.    To increase to 50 per cent, as is proposedin paz*a graph &quot;6(b) of &quot;the. Minister of Housing&apos;s paper fC.P.(55) 66), is bound to increase the cost to the Exchequer&quot; sometime by one-third;on the programme suggested by the Minister, there would be an increaseof about  15 millions.7.        The Minister of Housing implies that the&apos;increase fromPer cent to 50 per cent in Exchequer grant need not, perhaps^ increasethe charge&quot; on public funds, for the amount of work&quot; permitted to be donecould be reduced correspondingly.    Obviously there would ultimately &quot;be a highex* charge, for on this basis the programme would have to coverCOPY NO.CABINETSECRETC.P.(55) 7111th June, 1955
a longer period. &quot;But even on the short run, I doubt whether this is avery effective safeguard, for in these circumstances the Minister might find himself having to restrict authorisations to local authorities&quot; &quot;sotightly that &quot;he and the Government would be under great pressure to spend more*8.       I therefore propose that we should retain the 37j per centExchequer grant in the Bill J and that we examine the position againwhen we have had some experience of the working of the Bill.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.11th July, 1955.
