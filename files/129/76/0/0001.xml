ERASMUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, the Minister of Defence and theFirst Lord of the AdmiraltyWe circulate herewith the documents which have emerged from our discussions with the South African Minister of Defence, Mr. Erasmus,,during the past week.2.        All our discussions have been ad referendum on both sides,although in our view Mr. Erasmus has authority to conclude agreementsforthwith on the transfer of Simonstown and the naval defence of SouthAfrica. :3.        The documents cover -(a) Simonstown(b) Naval Defence(c) Middle East Defence and the proposedAfrican Defence OrganisationSimonstown4.        An agreement governing the transfer to South.

V/* appeax- to have reached a satisfactory agreement on this,including in particular safeguards for coloured workpeople in the base,subject only to two outstanding points -(i)   The date of transfer.    We have suggested threeyears from the date of signature of the agree-ment or sooner if the necessary preliminariescan be completed more quickly.    The south africans wish a period of one year to benamed.(ii)    Financial arrangements for the acquisition bySouth Africa of the substantial assets (buildings,works and equipment) comprised in the base.-There .is-a colourable case under an agreement^oncluded in 1930 for the South Africans to claim most of these assets for nothing.
mNaval Defence5.       An agreement on the naval defence of the sea routes round the cape is at Appendix B.    We appear to have reached an almost entirely-satisfactory agreement on this, committing the South Africans to purchase 18 millions worth of British ships. United Kingdom command and control in a war in which South Africa is engaged, arrangements for joint planning and training in peacetime, and the use of Simonstown in a war in whichSouth Africa is neutral.6.        In our view these naval agreements are satisfactory in themselvessubject to a reasonable settlement of fee two outstanding points in      -paragraph 4.Middle East Defence and the proposed African Defence Organisation7.       Attached as Appendices C and D are two documents on theserelated subjects which we have been discussing with the South Africans.No agreement to either of them has yet been given by the South Africansor ourselves.H.S.L..J.F.L.T.22nd June, 1955.
SECRET.   APPENDIX   A,     Agreements on Sinonstown -and Defence of Sea CommunicationsAlthough, the Agreement on the defence of sea coiHnunidations roundSouthern Africa and the expansion of the South African Navy might he thoughtlogically to precede the Agreement on Simonstown, the South Africans haveinsisted that the latter should be regarded as the first document.2,     By the Simonstown Agreement we should hand over the administration and&quot;control of the base in order that the South Africans may bo able to provide adequate logistic support for their expanded Navy. - In return, the south africans give a number of undertakings, which may be summed up under three main headings:-Availability of the base facilities to the R.N. in peace and war.Maintenance in an efficient state.Safeguards for Admiralty employees and for future non-European workers.Availability in peace and war.     The facilities of the base -Kill be available to the R,N. in peace, andto the R.N. and its allies in any war in which the U.K, is involved.   V/henthe Union is a co-belligerent, priority in the use of the base will besettled in-mutual consultation,   (it can be assumed that in thesecircumstances the R.N. and its allies would also be able to use other SouthAfrican ports, but LCr. Erasmus is unwilling to say this explicitly in theagreement.)   To ensure availability of the Simonstown facilities in the eventof South African neutrality, the South Africans will maintain facilitieselsewhere for their own Navy to use in a war in which we, but not they, are involved.Efficiency4.     The South Africans will maintain the facilities of the base in theirpresent state of efficiency.   They recognise that to do this they will haveto retain a considerable number of staff from the U.K. on loan for aconsiderable time, and to rely on us for the training of their key men inthe dockyard organisation.   In addition, they agree to retain at least theexisting standard for recruitment of locally-entered apprentices and skilled and semi-skilled labour generally.5.    In peacetime they willhave to provide permanently for two frigates ofthe Royal Navy and for their own expanded Navy.   They will accordinglyenlarge the capacity of the base to ensure the fulfilment of the Agreement;this enlargement will take the form both of physical construction and, ifpossible, of expansion of the labour force.Safeguards for Admiralty Employees and Coloured \7orkersU.K. based employees6.     The conditions of service of staff seconded from the U.K. will beat least as good as present Admiralty practice, and they wall not berequired to learn Afrikaans.Locally Entered employees in service at time of transfer7.

(They may be expected to give preference toqualified Europeans, but the shortage of. these will oblige them to recruitskilled non-Europeans. )   There -vri.ll be no discrimination based on colour in rates of pay for comparable work or in security of tenure.Special provision. for Cape V/T Stations9.     The Cape Vi/T installations will not be handed over until the south africans can provide sufficient qualified personnel to run them.   after their eventual transfer they will continue to fulfil the requirements of theRoyal Navy&apos;s worldwide wireless organisation, and in a war in which theU.K. is. involved their control will pass back to the R.N.

E0Draft Heads of AgreementI.   Agreement relating to the Transferof the Simonstown Naval Base1.     Consequent upon the intention of the Union Government to expand theSouth African Navy as described in the accompanying Agreement on defence of sea communications round Southern Africa, and in order that the UnionGovernment may &quot;be able to provide adequate logistic support for theirexpanded Navy;    the United Kingdom Government agree to hand over to the UnionGovernment the administration and control of the Naval Base at Simonstown inaccordance with the provisions which follow.2.     It is agreed that the Royal Navy will continue to require the use of thefacilities of the base in peace and in war.    The Union Government agree thatthe facilities of the base will be available for use by the Royal Navy inpeace and by the Royal Navy and navies allied to it in any war in which theUnited Kingdom is involved.     /if the Union is a co-belligerent, it will naturally follow that the Royal Navy and its allies will enjoy full use of the maritime facilities of the Union, not only at Simonstown^/&quot;3.     In a war in which the Union is a co-belligerent, priority in theallocation of space and facilities in the base between the two navies willbe settled by mutual consultation between the Commander-in-Chief of the strategic Zone referred to in the accompanying Agreement on the defence of sea communications round Southern Africa and the South African Naval Chief ofStaff, as strategic and operational needs may require.4.     The proposed expansion of the South African Navy will necessitate theprovision for use in war of naval facilities beyond the capacity ofSimonstown, so as to ensure that the facilities of the base shall in fact beavailable, to the extent required, for use by the Royal Navy and its allies in any war in which the United Kingdom, but not the Union, is involved.   Tothis end the Union Government will take, if necessary in peace, any measures required to ensure the availability of additional facilities elsewhere in theUnion for use by the South African Navy in a war in which the United Kingdom,but not the Union, is involved. .SECRET/5.
SECRET- 2 -5.     The Union Government will maintain the facilities of the base atSimonstown in a state of efficiency not inferior to that existing at thetime of transfer.6.     The Union Government recognise that the replacement of United Kingdompersonnel of the base by South African personnel must be a gradual and controlled process.   Detailed proposals for this replacement are at Annex A.The Union Government will continue normally to send South African personnel to the United Kingdom for training in dockyard and armament supply work.7.     The Union Government will give to personnel seconded from the UnitedKingdom conditions of service not less favourable than those set out at annex B.     In connection with the condition that seconded personnel shouldnot be required to learn Afrikaans, the Union Government will take measuresto ensure that no difficulty arises in practice from the use of English bythese personnel.-8.     In order to ensure that the standard of efficiency of the base ismaintained, the Union Government agree to retain at least the existingstandard for the entry and training of locally-entered apprentices, and forthe recruitment of skilled and semi-skilled labour generally.9.     The Union Government agree:-(a) that if there is a deficiency of qualified European labour,non-Europeans of the required standard will be recruited on abasis of merit(b) that there will be no discrimination based on colour in therates of pay for comparable jobs.    (This is the existing practice in the Cape Province).(c) that non-Europeans, once recruited, will have the same securityof tenure as Europeans, as is the existing practice in the Union./10.
SECRET- 3 -10.   The Union Government agree that no locally-entered employee in service in the &quot;base at the date of transfer will be discharged except for seriousmisconduct, inefficiency, or redundancy.    The conditions of service andsuperannuation rights of locally-entered civilian personnel in admiralty service when transfer occurs will be not less favourable than those set out at Annex C.11.    The Union Government agree to expand the facilities of the base to theextent necessary to ensure the fulfilment of this Agreement, taking intoaccount the expansion of the South African Navy referred to in the accompany-ing Naval Defence Agreement.     Detailed particulars of the measures requiredare set out in Annex D.12.    In peace the refit and docking programmes at Simonstown will be settleddirectly between the Royal Naval Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic, and theSouth African Naval Chief of Staff.    The Union Government will send vessels of the South African Navy acquired from the United Kingdom to the UnitedKingdom for such refits as cannot be undertaken at Simonstown Dockyard.13.    It is agreed that the Royal Naval Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic,will retain his present responsibilities for, and authority over, the W/Tinstallations known as Slangkop, Klaver, and Cape East until a date to bedecided by mutual agreement, when the South African Navy can provide theofficers and senior ratings together with the majority of the remainingcommunications personnel.     After the transfer of the W/T installations,the Union Government will continue to fulfil the requirements of the world-wide wireless organisation of the Royal Navy and will provide the Commander-in-Chief with the necessary facilities for that purpose;    they will alsocontinue to employ Royal Naval personnel for the maintenance of equipment atthe two transmitting stations until, by mutual agreement, the South AfricanNavy are able to provide all the officers and men required for this purpose.The Union Government will, in the event of a war in which the United kingdom is involved, place the command and control of the Vf/n installations in thehands of the Commander-in-Chief.
-   414.   Arrangements will be made by mutual agreement between the twoGovernments to settle, on the lines suggested in the report of the Joint&quot;forking Party submitted in November, 1954, miscellaneous questions arisingout of the transfer of the control and administration of the base.   these will include the use o:? detention quarters, recreational amenities, the dockyard church, the sick bay, and the chart depot, the establishment of distributing authorities, and questions of naval discipline.15.     The Royal Navy will wish to store certain strategic reserves ofammunition (approximately 2,500 tons) at Ganspan after the armament depotthere has been transferred to the Union Defence Force, in addition to 500tons of Royal Naval ammunition that it will be necessary to store atSimonstown.    The Union Government agree in principle to this, subject to conditions to be determined.16.     Financial arrangements:    still under discussion by officials.17.     The transfer of the administration and control of the base will takeplace three years from the date of this Agreement, or sooner if it should prove practicable to make all the necessary detailed preparatory arrange-ments;.   these will proceed as quickly as possible.18.    It is agreed that these Heads of Agreement, except when they specificallymodify the report of the Joint Working Party submitted in November 1954,shall be regarded as amplified by that report.Note   -   throughout this Agreement and its Annexes the word&quot;Admiralty&quot; shall be interpreted as referring to theCommissioners for the time being for executing theOffice of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland./Annex A
oANNEX AReplacement of United Kingdom personnel by South AfricanpersonnelThe replacement of personnel from the United Kingdom employed in the base by South African personnel must, it is agreed, be governed by the need to ensure that the efficiency of the base is maintained.   Initially, anduntil South African personnel have acquired sufficient knowledge and experience, most of the posts at present filled by United Kingdom non-industrial or industrial staff will have to continue to be so filled.    Itwill be necessary for volunteers from the United Kingdom to come forward for secondment to the Union Government;   conditions of service for personnelseconded in this way will be not less favourable than those set out in annex B,2,     As an exception to this general principle, however, South AfricanOfficers will be appointed, so soon after the conclusion of this agreement as the Union Government wish, to understudy the existing United Kingdomofficers in certain appointments, including those of Captain Superintendentof the Dockyard and Chief Engineer, for varying minimum periods.    Such anarrangement will not be possible for the Heads of the Constructive, ArmamentSupply, and Works Departments, who will have, together with the majorityof the United Kingdom Staff in all the departments of the Dockyard, to beretained on secondment until such time as they can be replaced by SouthAfrican personnel with the necessary qualifications and experience.    TheSouth African officer provisionally designated to succeed the ElectricalEngineer- in-Charge will be sent to the United Kingdom for the acquisition of knowledge and experience;   he will return to Simonstown when it is agreed between the Admiralty and the South African Navy that he is able to undertake the responsibilities of taking charge in this particularly difficult field,/and
and will then understudy the United Kingdom based Electrical Engineer-in-Charge for a short period before relieving him.3.      In the Chargeman, Inspector, Draughtsman, Foreman, and LeadingDraughtsman grades, it is expected that the periods of the change over from United Kingdom to South African personnel will necessarily be substantial.4.     Details of the replacement of United Kingdom personnel by South Africanpersonnel will have to be worked out in the light of experience, bearing inmind the principle agreed by both Governments that the efficiency of the base must be maintained.5.     Conversely, it might be necessary, in order to meet the needs of theexpansion programme for the South African Navy, to secure for a timeadditional United Kingdom personnel for the Dockyard if the Admiralty arein a position to provide them./   Note for information of Ministers:-The previous draft of Annex A included in paragraph 2 suggestions that 18 months should be the period of understudy for the CaptainSuperintendent and the Chief Engineer and that 3 years should be theperiod of study in the United Kingdom for the Electrical Engineer-in-Charge d .signatej    and in paragraph 3 that the periods of change over forthe skilled grades named might well be of the following order:-Chargemen 3 to 7 yearsInspectors and Draughtsmen 10 yearsForemen and Leading Draughtsmen 15 years it was agreed at official level that these figures should be omitted from the Annex, but that in a private exchange of correspondence itshould be recognised that periods of this order vrould be likely^/&quot;
^zANNEX BCONDITIONS OF SERVICE FOR SECONDED STAFFIn order to obtain volunteers for service on secondment with the SouthAfrican Government the conditions of service offered would need to include thefoilowing:-(1)     Salary or wages not less than those attaching to corresponding duties inthe United Kingdom^ plus a foreign service allowance adequate to match the higher standard of living and higher costs in South Africa.    The methods of calculatingthis allowance adopted by Departments in the United Kingdom would probably be suitable.    In any case the remuneration offered should not fall below that of a european locally entered employee of the corresponding grade.(2)     Free outward and return passages for volunteers and their families, andfor their effects (including furniture) in accordance with the scales laid downby the Admiralty.(3)     Payment of all certified removal expenses in connection with leaving and return to the United Kingdom in accordance with Admiralty practice, includingliability for unexpired leases and rental agreements up to a maximum of six months.(4)     Return passages and related expenses to be guaranteed except for volunteerswho fail to complete the period of secondment for reasons within their owncontrol, or who are found guilty of gross misconduct.(5)     Suitable single or married accommodation, as the case may be, to beavailable immediately or very shortly after arrival.   For this purpose theSouth African Navy authorities would need for several years to come to retain forthe use of seconded personnel most of the accommodation at present provided bythe Admiralty for its United Kingdom staff and their families.(6)   Provision to ensure that the period of secondment counts under the United/Kingdom
-   2   -Kingdom Superannuation Acts.(7)   Free medical, dental, and optical treatment for volunteers and their families in South Africa.   Alternatively the foreign service allowance should contain an element to allow for payment of medical expenses.(8)    If desired by the parent, free education of appropriate standards for children in schools maintained by South African public authorities.   special provision would need to be made for children between the ages of 5 and 7years.(9)    Contribution in accordance with Admiralty practice towards school fees andmaintenance expenses of children who for educational or other reasons haveto remain in the United Kingdom.(10)    Secondment to be for a fixed period determined beforehand, and personnelconcerned to have the right to return, if so desired, immediately on completion.(11)    Secondment to be to a specified place of duty, and no seconded personnel tobe expected to serve at any other place in a permanent or quasipermanentcapacity except as volunteers and on payment of all extra expenses involved.Failure to volunteer for extended service elsewhere than at the place of duty.&apos; initially specified not to be regarded as a breach of contract.   Seconded men would however, be expected if necessary to spend short periods at other places in the normal course of their duties.(12) Overseas family allowances to be paid in accordance with the presentAdmiralty practice.(13) Seconded civilians to be entitled to the same freedom of organisation forthe protection and representation of their interests and the same facilitiesfor joint consultation with the management as are enjoyed at present by united Kingdom based staff and agreement workmen.
-2A-(14)   Seconded men should not he required to learn Afrikaans.(15)   In order to ensure the goodwill of the Staff Associations andTrade Unions representing the Admiralty employees from whomvolunteers would be recruited, the proposed conditions shouldbe discussed with these organisations before they arepromulgated,(16)   The foregoing would apply mutatis mutandis to any Royal Navypersonnel seconded for service in the base under the UnionGovernment.\jSSCRiST
iJMEX CLocally-entered personnel in general the existing locally-entered personnel should all beretained in employment on transfer of the base, subject to the safeguardsdiscussed in paragraph 2 below.   Exceptional cases may, however, arise when an existing South African organisation can take over, with little or no increase of staff, work at present performed by Admiralty employees.It is recognised that in such oases the Union public service might be quite unable to absorb all the Admiralty employees rendered redundant inthe base.   This might occur, for example, with motor transport drivers inthe Naval Store Department.   Conditions governing termination ofemployment in such oases would need to be worked out in detail.2.     It is agreed as a general principle that the prospects of thelocally-entered staff in Admiralty service at the time should be fullypreserved.   This applies to both nen-industrial and industrial grades.To give effect to this principle it is agreed that when control of the base is handed to the South African Navy the following provisions shouiabe applied by the Union Government;-(i) \No employee in service at the date of transfer shouldbe discharged except for serious misconduct, inefficiency,or redundancy.   The disciplinary procedure should providethe employee with the same opportunity to state his case as he has under ii-dmiralty Dockyard Regulations.   In the.event of redundancy the order of discharge should follow the principles in force under the Admiralty.In particular no employee in service at the date of transfer should be discharged on the ground ofunwillingness or inability to reaoh any particulardegree of proficienoy in either of the two officiallanguages of the Union.   Equally, no employee overthe age of 50 should be denied promotion on that ground:/younger.. ...S E C RET
L\&apos;CDyounger men should be allowed a term of not less than three years to acquire any language qualification laiddown by the Union Government for promotion.(iii)   The wage or salaries and cost of living allowance paidto employees transferred to Union employment shouldinitially be not less than those in force at the dateof transfer, except fir any individual downgraded fordisciplinary reasons.   Thereafter they should continue tobe related to the practice of good employers in the area.(iv)   No discrimination in rates of wages or conditions ofservice based on rase or colour should be applied toemployees taken over by the Union Government unless itwas already operating at the date of transfer,(v)   Established employees should &quot;be guaranteed continuity of employment to the normal retiring age for theirgrade, subject only to the right of the Union authoritiesto discharge any individual for serious misconduct or adecline in efficiency so marked as to make him unfitto perform the duties of his grade or any lower gradefor which he might be qualified,(vi)   Arrangements should be made to preserve the superannuation rights accrued by established employeesunder the United Kingdom Superannuation Acts and togive superannuation benefits under the Union regulations in respect of established service rendered after thedate of transfer.   If possible, established employeesalready entitled to benefits under the United Kingdom schemefor widows&apos; and dependents1 pensions should be affordedsimilar protection in future.(vii)   The Union Government should undertake to provide in thefuture opportunities of entry into their &quot;fixed establishment&quot;at least equal to those prospects of establishment a^ccordedby the Admiralty at present; and there should be no/discrimination...
discrimination in this respect between Europeans and non-Europeans.(viii)   The Union Government will give an assurance in principlethat unestablished employees retained on transfer of the basewill receive gratuities on a basis not less favourable than theycould have expected if the Admiralty had continued to administer the base;   arrangements to implement this principle vrlll be worked out or experts of the two Governments.     The UnionGovernment will also treat equitably in the matter of gratuitiesany employees who are redundant as a result of the transfer,(ix)   The opportunities at present afforded to the locally-enteredemployees for making representations to the management should becontinued.(x)    Before the transfer of the base occurs representatives of the tiwGovernments should discuss these issues with the MechanicsUnions Joint Executive and the representatives of the locally-entered non-industrial staff.   Account should be taken of any proposals made by thea for additional safeguards without any undertaking to adopt all or any of such proposals./Annex D
