NEHRUNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate for perusal and return, a record of the talks with Mr. Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, on 8th and 9th July.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK.\Cabinet Office, S.W.I,11th July, 1955.

The following points were covered in the discussions on 8th July betweenthe Prime Minister and Mr. Nehru, and on 9th July between the Prime Ministerand. Mr. Nehru, Mr. Krishna Menon, Mrs. Pandit, Sir R. Pillai, Mr. HaroldMacmillan, Lord Home, and Mr. Malcolm Macdonald.Soviet policy . Mr. Nehru said that he had been greatly impressed by the changedatmosphere in Russia. He had seen a great deal of all the principal Soviet leaders,with the exception of Mr. Molotov, who left the day after Mr. Nehru&apos;s arrivalto go to San Francisco. They seemed to be on remarkably good terms with one another. His impression had been that towards the end of the Stalin regime therehad been a strong reaction against Stalinism and in particular against some ofthe people who surrounded Stalin, like Beria. The new leaders had eliminatedBeria as soon as they felt themselves strong enough to&apos; do so. It was significant that of all the present Soviet leaders Malenkov had been the one closest to Stalin.There had been a remarkable rise in the standard of living. Housing and thesupply of consumer goods had vastly improved, and it was now even possible for ordinary Russians to have their own motor-cars. In fact the traffic on the roadswas surprisingly heavy. Everywhere he went there were vast schemes of industrial expansion in hand.3. All this meant that the inclination of the Russian leaders, and those oftheir people, were pushing them in the direction of a-relaxation of tension. Hehad the impression that the Russians wanted to settle down. They were fully occupied in developing their own economy and wanted some relief from militaryburdens.4. His impression was that the Russians were negotiable. But that did not mean that they would be negotiating through weakness. We and the americans should realise this. He believed that we might be at a great turning point in historybrought about by the advent of the new Russian leaders and also perhaps by thatof nuclear weapons. Certainly the Russians were coming to realise what nuclearwarfare meant.   They had genuine fears of American strategy.5. The Prime Minister explained in general terms to Mr. Nehru alone our proposals for giving the Russians some reassurance that the adherence of a re-unitedGermany to the West would not mean an increased threat to Russian security.Mr. Nehru agreed that Germany was the core of the problem and said that theseideas were very much in line with his own thinking.Far East \6. Mr. Nehru said that although there had been a lull in the past six months in the Formosa situation, it could not be expected to continue indefinitely so longas Chiang-kai-Shek with American support, continued to occupy the OffshoreIslands. Chou-en-Lai was looking for some sign of progress in American policyand expected India to help over this. He had made a contribution by releasingthe four American fliers, but this had not so far been matched by a similarcontribution by the American side. Mr. Nehru had had three messages fromChou-en-Lai on the subject and he was in some difficulty to know how to reply.Mr. Krishna Menon had found in Washington that the Americans had, if anything,become less conciliatory. After Chou-en-Lai&apos;s speech at Bandung, Mr. Dulles had said that he was ready for direct negotiations. Mr. Nehru had received in Romea long and friendly message from the President in which the latter said that he was prepared to send a representative of the United States Government, of the status of Ambassador, to meet a similar representative of the Chinese Communists in&apos;Geneva. Their discussions should be concerned with matters affecting relationsbetween the two countries only, and not those which affected third parties. It was clear that what the President had in mind was principally the question of theAmerican prisoners in China and that of the Chinese Nationals in the United States.7.1 Mr. Nehru and Mr. Krishna Menon thought that this proposal did not go nearly far enough. It did not touch the core of the problem, which was theOffshore Islands. Unless the Americans were prepared to discuss that, thenecessary atmosphere for an improvement in Chinese-American relations would48383
&quot;2.oA Far Eastern Conference10. Mr. Nehru said thatBulganin and others in Moscow had tried to persuade him that the Geneva Conference should be followed by a Six-Power one with theChinese Communists and the Indians, on the Far East. Mr. Nehru had repliedthat in his view the time was not yet ripe. The Prime Minister agreed. Mr. Nehrucontinued that in present circumstances it would never be possible to get agreement on the composition of such a Conference, and so long as that situation lasted, he did not think it useful to pursue this idea. The Russians would certainly raiseFar Eastern matters at Geneva.Cambodia11. The Prime Minister explained to Mr. Nehru the great importance he attached to the idea that the Indians should send a Mission to train the Cambodianarmy. If the Indians were in there and in Laos, the Communists would not want to make trouble there. This was perhaps the only way in the long run to maintainthe independence of Cambodia and Laos.12. Mr. Nehru said that he had been prepared to send an Indian Mission oftwo hundred men. U Nu had discussed this in Bangkok with Mr. Dulles whoseemed to support the idea. The subsequent actions of Mr. Dulles had been difficult to understand. Chou En-lai had reacted very strongly to the american agreement with Cambodia on military aid. There was also the difficulty that theCambodians themselves seemed reluctant to accept an Indian Mission. Theywere accustomed to the Franch and did not want to see them replaced either by indians or by Americans. Moreover, they had asked India for 40 million dollars&apos;worth of aid, which it was out of the question for her to provide.13. The Prime Minister said that we did not consider the American-Cambodian agreement incompatible with the Geneva settlement. The Cambodiansneeded the dollars, which only the United States could provide. He still hopedvery much that Mr. Nehru would be willing to send a Mission.14. Mr. Nehru did not commit himself but did not reject the idea. Hefinally produced a telegram from U Nu in Washington to the effect that the latter had discussed the subject with Mr. Dulles who had said that if the Indians sent a mission the Americans would be prepared to delegate to it the supervision of theend-use of American military aid. This seemed to Mr. Nehru to be an advance on the part of the Americans. The Prime Minister said that he would raise thequestion with the President at Geneva.Laos15. The Prime Minister showed Mr. Nehru telegram No. 254 from Vientianeshowing that the Pathet Lao forces, supported by the Viet Minh, had launched anattack against Laotian Government posts. He said that he was worried about theposition in Laos where it had always seemed to him that the real intention of the communists was to take over the two northern provinces.    ;- 1 ......---------not be created. It was necessary to bring the Americans back to the position ofbeing willing to have direct discussions with the Chinese Communists withoutprovisos of a kind contained in the President^ message.8. On the question of Chinese Nationals in the United States the americans were making difficulties. They were insisting that these people should leave before6th September, which was impracticable. The Chinese maintained that their numbers were much greater than the Americans admitted. It would be necessaryfor some third party to help over the practical arrangements and finance.9. Meanwhile the situation in the Offshore Islands remained dangerous. Itwas no use expecting the Communists to say that they would never use force therein any circumstances, when the islands were heavily fortified with American help.The present lull would not be expected to last much longer. If the Chineseattacked in the Offshore Islands and the Americans did not go to the help ofChiang-kai-Shek, the United States would lose prestige. If on the other handAmerica intervened, that would mean atomic war. The Americans must be helped to extricate themselves from this dilemma.
16. Mr. Nehru and Mr. Krishna Menon maintained that it was the RoyalLaotian Government who were blocking a political settlement. They were doing so by attaching impossible conditions to the elections, conditions which would infact mean that the Pathet Lao would be excluded from participation. Mr. MaicblmMacdonald denied that this was so; on the contrary, it was the Pathet Lao whohad been trying to secure disproportionate representation for themselves. ThePrime Minister repeated that the best chance of bringing about a political settlement in Laos, which Mr. Nehru and Mr. Krishna Menon agreed was essential, was forthe Indians to play an active part there.Viet Nam17. Mr. Nehru had little to say about this, except that he had formed an unfavourable impression of Diem&apos;s Government from the attitude of his repre-sentative at Bandung. The latter had made a violent attack on a resolution putforward by Mr. Nehru expressing the hope that the Geneva settlement would becarried out.18. Mr. Nehru had useful talks with the Polish Government in Warsaw aboutthe work of the International Mission and the importance of upholding the Genevasettlement.10th July, 1955.
