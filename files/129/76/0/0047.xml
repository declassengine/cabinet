Printed for the Cabinet. August 1955SECRET Copy No.CP. (55) 9710th Augusts 1955CABINETSINGAPORE : CONSTITUTIONAL CRISISMemorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial affairs my colleagues are aware of the events which led up to a resolution by theLegislative Assembly in Singapore endorsing the Chief Ministers view that wherethe Governor is required by the constitution to consult with the Chief Minister heshould act in accordance with such advice and stating that a new constitutionproviding for self-government should be granted immediately. I attach at appendix A a brief summary of the history of these events. I also attach, at appendix B, a note showing the sections of the constitution which require theGovernor to consult with the Chief Minister and explaining what would be involved on each such occasion if the Legislative Assembly resolution were accepted.2. The Colonial Secretary has discussed matters with the Chief Minister, theGovernor of Singapore and the Commissioner-General for the United Kingdom inSouth-East Asia and has sent the following assessment of the situation andrecommendations as to what should be done. From these it clearly emerges thatthere are now two issues to be faced. To the original demand that the governor should always accept the Chief Ministers advice where he is required to consulthim has been added the wider demand for a general re-examination of theconstitution. The Colonial Secretary will be required to give decisions on thesematters when he returns to Singapore on 15th August.3. It is evident from his talks with the Colonial Secretary that the ChiefMinisters main concern is to secure early agreement that the Governor should accept his advice in all cases where he is required to consult with him. Provided thathe gets this agreement in relation to those sections of the constitution which dealwith the appointment and dismissal of Ministers and the allocation of duties to them(that is those referred to in the first six paragraphs of Appendix B), he will in theColonial Secretary&apos;s view probably accept some retention of the Governorsdiscretion under those sections which deal with the prorogation and dissolution ofthe Assembly and the establishment and functions of committees of the Council ofMinisters.4. As regards those sections of the constitution which relate to theappointment and dismissal of Ministers and the allocation of duties to them, theGovernor himself feels that it would be more satisfactory if his discretionary powers were removed both because their retention widens the field of possible constitutionalcrisis otherwise bounded by his Reserve Powers and because it is wrong that theGovernor should be dragged into the personalities and politics which arise from such appointments. He also considers that the Chief Minister should be placedin a position where he has to defend himself in the Assembly and in public onsuch matters and there should be no grounds for attacking the Governor in association with him.5. As regards the Governor^ discretionary powers in relation to the prorogation and dissolution of the Legislative Assembly, the Colonial Secretaryagrees that in the present circumstances of Singapore it is essential that theGovernor should retain his discretion in the power of dissolution.   But he has48555 B
asked whether, if pressed, it might be possible to make some concession in regardto the power of prorogation. In the United Kingdom there is, in fact, somedistinction between the two. I understand that although The Queen wouldinvariably agree if advised that Parliament should be prorogued, there is authorityfor the proposition that in certain circumstances The Queen might constitutionallyrefuse to accept the Prime Minister^ advice to dissolve. On this analogy it wouldbe possible if the Colonial Secretary finds that some concession on the issue ofprorogation is essential, to agree that the Governor should follow the advice of theChief Minister regarding the prorogation of the Assembly, but insist that he should retain his discretion on the power of dissolution.6. I consider also that it might be possible, if the Colonial Secretary considersit essential, to concede that the Governor should accept the advice of the chief minister regarding the establishment and functions of committees of the Councilof Ministers provided that it is clearly understood that the Governor may use hisreserved executive power to secure that such committees should include any minister whom he considered to be directly affected by their work.7. The obvious way to meet the Chief Ministers point of view on thesematters would be by means of an amendment to the constitution. The chief minister, however, is anxious that this method should not be pursued both because he has hitherto taken the line that his request amounted to no more than a &quot;liberalinterpretation &quot; of the present constitution and this course would be a furtherpublic indication that he was wrong, and also because he has said that if therewere any question of making amendments to the constitution he would have totake the occasion to ask for a number of other changes which would be contentiousand embarrassing and which he does not wish to raise yet. It is clearly impossibleto accept the Chief Minister^ suggestion that the change can be effected by a&quot; liberal interpretation &quot; of the constitution, since Her Majesty&apos;s Government havepublicly endorsed the view that the changes requested by the Chief Minister would run contrary to the constitution and would amount to an amendment to it. Itwould also make impossible the differentiation between prorogation and dissolutionsuggested in paragraph 5 above and it would be a most embarrassing precedentelsewhere e.g., in the Gold Coast.There is fortunately a third way of meeting the Chief Ministers request which involves neither accepting his interpretation of the constitution nor amending theconstitutional instruments. Section 7 of the Order in Council provides that theGovernor should act in accordance with such instructions as may from time to time be given to him under Her Majesty&apos;s Sign Manual and Signet or through a Secretaryof State. It would therefore be possible for the Colonial Secretary to issue formalinstructions to the Governor that he should accept the advice of the Chief minister on those occasions where the constitution requires him to consult with him subjectto the reservations referred to in Appendix B.8. The demand in the Legislative Assembly resolution for the grant of immediate self-government was largely forced upon the Chief Minister by themanoeuvres of the Right wing party who hoped thus to recover ground they had lost in an earlier debate. In the view of the Colonial Secretary the Chief minister himself, if he were a free agent, might agree that no more should be said at present about a further re-examination of the constitution; but he is not his own masterin this matter and unless something is said to meet the strong views of theLegislative Assembly on the issue he is likely, to lose the support of his ownMinisters and his Government would then fall with the disastrous consequencesexplained in paragraph 10 below. The Chief Minister realises that it is out ofthe question that Singapore should at any time take over responsibility for its ownexternal defence or for foreign affairs, but he is very anxious, in order to maintainhis position in the Legislative Assembly, to be able to give some date for the achievement of full internal self-government. The least that- he could acceptwithout seriously endangering his own position would be the announcement of aconference next year in London to review the constitution in the light of theyear&apos;s working.The programme which the Chief Minister has in mind is  i(1) talks in London in 1956;(2) these to lead up to the creation of a Ministry of Justice (not responsiblefor internal security) and an enlarged Legislative Assembly; and(3) full internal self-government in 1959.
jProvided that the programme resulted in agreement, leaving the Governor with responsibility (as in, e.g., the Gold Coast, Jamaica and Nigeria) over foreign affairs,external defence and internal security (i.e., the Police), it might be acceptable,The Chief Minister may at a later stage make difficulty over internal security butthe Colonial Secretary has said that this must be regarded as of vital concern toHer Majesty&apos;s Government.9. The Colonial Secretary is convinced that nationalist feelings have risen sofast in Singapore that it is no longer possible unilaterally to control the pace of constitutional advance. The choice lies between a refusal to make concessionswith what the Colonial Secretary has described as &quot; bloody and disastrous consequences &quot; and meeting the demand for constitutional advance fast enoughto keep the peace and retain a guiding influence over developments.10. The Colonial Secretary considers that the Chief Minister, although at times unreasonable and obstinate, is a man with whom it would be possible tosecure reasonable co-operation in the future conduct of the Government provided the present difficulties are overcome. He considers that there is no real alternative to seeking to secure his co-operation. The Chief Minister is genuinely anti-Communist and the only figure at present who has a chance of standing up tothe extreme Left wing. His resignation or defeat would play straight into the handsof the Communists in that it would lead to the complete breakdown of the present constitution and an indefinite period of direct control backed by large militaryforces and accompanied by widespread strikes and civil disturbances. It is most unlikely that any alternative Government could be formed from the presentLegislative Assembly except possibly one even more to the extreme Left, whilefresh elections would in all likelihood produce a Government of the extreme Leftwing People&apos;s Action Party, whose policy would almost certainly make the existing constitution unworkable.11. In considering all these matters the Colonial Secretary has made it clearthat he has in the forefront of his mind the great Imperial interests in defence andother matters reaching far beyond Singapore which we must strive to preserveundamaged. He is satisfied in the light of his assessment of the situation setout above that the best way of preserving these interests is to maintain the chief minister in office. He asks that he may be authorised to negotiate the best possiblesettlement within the limits of the terms set out below. These terms do not byany means go the whole way to meet the Chief Minister^ claims and they safeguard the position on those points where it is important in our interests that the governor should retain his existing powers:  (a) That the Governor should in future accept the advice of the Chief minister on all matters relating to the appointment and dismissal of ministers and Assistant Ministers and the allocation of duties between them.x These are set out in paragraphs 1 to 6 inclusive of Appendix B to this paper and reservations would be necessary as suggested at the end of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Appendix, as regards the allocation of subjects to ex officio Ministers and the appointment of Assistants to them.(b) That the Governor should accept the advice of the Chief Minister regardingthe prorogation of the Legislative Assembly but he should retain his discretion regarding its dissolution. This concession should only bemade as a last resort if it was clear that the success or failure of the talks depended on it.(c) That the Governor should accept the advice of the Chief Ministerregarding the establishment and composition of committees of theCouncil of Ministers but that he should retain the right to insist thatall such committees should include any Minister whom he considersto be directly affected by their work.(d) That the above changes be not made by means of a &quot; liberal interpretation &quot;of the constitution or by an amendment to it but by means of formalinstructions to the Governor containing the reservations quoted inparagraph 7 above; any amendments to the constitution.can be left toa suitable future occasion. :(e) That it should be agreed that there will be talks in London next summer to review the constitution in the light of its working since April 1955.The Colonial Secretary would wish to be authorised to add if need bethat such talks would be comprehensive and include consideration ofthe timing of possible future constitutional advances.48555 B 2
The Colonial Secretary should, I suggest, also endeavour to secure that anyagreed statement covering these five points should include (1) a recognition by the singapore Government that the present constitution was a great step forward and,given good will, is fully workable; and (2) an expression of the sincere intentionof that Government so to work the constitution.H. H.Colonial Office, S.W.1,9th August, 1955.Appendix a background TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS INSINGAPOREThe present constitutional crisis arose from a request to the Governor bythe Chief Minister on 9th July for the appointment of four additional AssistantMinisters. The Governor would only agree to appoint two on the grounds thatthere were already ten Ministers in a Legislative Assembly of thirty-two and thatthere was no real need for more than two additional Assistant Ministers. He feared that to appoint more would lend colour to an accusation that the objective was toprovide &quot; jobs for the boys.&quot;2. The appointment of Assistant Ministers is in the discretion of the Governorwho may appoint them after consultation with the Chief Minister. The chief minister realising that his case for the additional Ministers was weak now shiftedhis ground and raised the general constitutional principle that the Governor should adopt a &quot; liberal interpretation &quot; of the constitution and should in all cases wherethe constitution obliges him to consult with the Chief Minister accept the latter&apos;advice. He maintained that to reject the Chief Ministers advice in such cases would imply lack of confidence in him which must lead to his resignation. TheGovernor replied that the correct interpretation of the constitution left discretion in such matters with the Governor and that to accept the Chief Ministersinterpretation would amount to an amendment of the constitution. He maintained that such an amendment could not be agreed between the Governor and the chief minister but must be the subject of consultations with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.He suggested that this subject should be one of the matters to be discussed withthe Colonial Secretary during his forthcoming visit to Singapore. The colonial secretary informed the Governor that he supported his view and the way he washandling the situation.3. At this stage it was reported that, the other Ministers were divided andthat the Chief Minister did not have their unanimous support, but by 19th July ithad become clear that the Chief Minister had persuaded them to his view andwith their support he threatened to resign if it was not accepted. On 21st July theColonial Secretary reported the position to the Cabinet (CM. (55) 25th Conclusions,Minute 8). He left for the Far East on 23rd July.4. The position at that stage therefore was that the Secretary of Statesupported the Governor:  (a) in refusing, on merits, to appoint four additional Assistant Ministers;\b) in his interpretation of the constitution and in his view that to accept11,,.- the Chief Minister^ interpretation would amount to an amendment ofthe constitution to which he could not properly agree and that suchan amendment must be the subject of discussions and agreement with her Majesty&apos;s Government; and(c) in suggesting that the matter should be discussed with the colonial secretary during his forthcoming visit to Singapore.i:;H ; &apos;5; -The Chief Minister called a special meeting of the Legislative assembly which on 25th July passed a resolution supporting the Chief Minister^ view thatthe Governor should accept his advice in all cases where the constitution required
him to consult with the Chief Minister and also stating that the time had comefor the grant of a new constitution providing for immediate self-government. TheGovernor sent a temporising reply to this resolution which he promised tocommunicate to the Colonial Secretary. The matter was reported to the Cabineton 26th July by the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs (CM. (55) 26thConclusions, Minute 5).6. The Chief Minister who had threatened to resign if the Governor did not immediately act on this resolution agreed to wait and to discuss the position withthe Colonial Secretary who was due to arrive in Singapore on 31st July. TheLegislative Assembly was adjourned until 2nd August and the Chief Ministerindicated he would make a statement to it then.7. On 28th July, the Defence Committee were informed that the colonial secretary planned to hold preliminary discussions with the Chief Minister during his visit to Singapore and to tell him that he would need to consult his colleaguesbefore these constitutional issues could be decided. The Defence committee approved this course (D.C. (55) 7th Meeting, Item 4). During the next few days,however, the Secretary of State received reports from the Governor of singapore and the Commissioner-General, South-East Asia, of a number of public statements made by the Chief Minister and their assessment of the situation. From these hejudged that it would be impossible for him to carry out his original tactics but thatit would be essential for him to have some freedom of manoeuvre in his discussions with the Chief Minister on 1st August if he were to avoid the resignation of theGovernment and the consequential serious political situation which would arise.This freedom of manoeuvre was given by the Prime Minister on 1st August in personal telegram No. 86 which was circulated to Cabinet Ministers.Appendix BMATTERS ON WHICH THE SINGAPORE CONSTITUTION requires the GOVERNOR TO CONSULT THE CHIEF MINISTEROrder in council.   &quot; S.21 (2). Of the appointed Ministers:  (a) one, who shall be styled &apos; the Chief Minister,&apos; shall be appointed by theGovernor acting in his discretion; and(b) the others shall be appointed by the Governor after consultation with theChief Minister.&quot;Comment. This relates to the choice of the appointed Ministers (by definitionex-officio Ministers are excluded). The Order in Council lays down that there shallbe six of them. The Council of Ministers is required to be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly and the Governor for practical reasons would normallyaccept the advice of the Chief Minister on the persons with whom he is preparedto work. The Governor did so when the present Labour Front Government was formed in April this year.2.   &quot; S.22 (2)-The office of an appointed Minister other than the Chief minister shall become vacant:  (a) if the office of the Chief Minister becomes vacant; or(b) if the Governor, after consultation with the Chief Minister, revokes his appointment thereto by Instrument under the Public Seal; or(c) if he shall leave the colony for any country or territory other thanthe Federation of Malaya without written permission given by theGovernor after consultation with the Chief Minister.&quot;Comment. This, relates to the dismissal of individual Ministers other thanex-officio Ministers and the Chief Minister and the granting to them of leave toleave the Colony. For the reasons given in paragraph 1 above the Governor would normally accept the Chief Ministers advice over the dismissal of an individualMinister and there would normally be no reason for him to dissent from such: adviceregarding leave of absence. ,,,, ,,,,,
3. &quot; S.30 (1). The Governor, after consultation with the Chief Minister, may, bydirections in writing:  (a) charge any Minister with the responsibility for any department or subject;and(b) revoke or vary any directions given under this sub-section: provided thatan appointed Minister shall not be charged with responsibility for anyof the matters set out in the Third Schedule to this Order.&quot;Comment. This relates to the allocation to Ministers of departmental responsibilities. The subjects reserved in the Third Schedule to the Order relateto internal security, defence and external affairs. The Governor would normallyaccept the Chief Ministers advice on this matter except that he would notnecessarily agree to any variation in the subjects normally dealt with by theex-officio Ministers.4. &quot; S.32. The Governor after consultation with the Chief Minister may, from among the Elected Members of the Assembly, appoint Assistant ministers to assist Ministers in the discharge of their duties and functions.&quot; -Comment.-This section was the cause of the present constitutional crisis. TheOrder in Council lays down no limit to the number of Assistant Ministers whichmay be appointed. The Governor would normally accept the advice of the chief minister as to the personalities to be appointed as Assistant Ministers. There seemsto be no practical objection to his accepting the advice of the Chief Minister as tothe numbers provided that it was clearly understood that the Governor had nodiscretion in the matter and the Chief Minister therefore took full responsibility forthe number appointed. The Governor would probably, however, wish to retaindiscretion over the appointment of Assistant Ministers to assist the ex-officioMinisters.5.   &quot; S.33 (/). The office of an Assistant Minister shall become vacant:  (a) if the office of Chief Minister becomes vacant; or(b) if the Governor, after consultation with the Chief Minister, revokes his appointment thereto; or(c) if he shall leave the Colony for any country or territory other than theFederation of Malaya without written permission given by theGovernor after consultation with the Chief Minister.&quot;Comment. These provisions for the vacation of office for Assistant Ministersfollow the same lines as those for Ministers and the same comments apply.6. &quot; S.35. The Governor, after consultation with the Chief Minister, may grantleave of absence from his duties to any Minister or Assistant Minister.&quot;Comment. There seems to be no objection to the Governor following theadvice of the Chief Minister on the granting of leave to Ministers and AssistantMinisters provided that the normal leave arrangements for ex-officio Ministers arenot thereby affected.7. &quot; S.67 (1). The Governor, after consultation with the Chief Minister, may atany time prorogue or dissolve the Assembly by Proclamation published in the Gazette.&quot;Comment. It is necessary that the Governor should retain his discretion inrelation to the dissolution of the Legislative Assembly. This discretion is retained in other Colonial territories in correspondence with the constitutional position ofthe Crown in this matter in the United Kingdom. There is, however, room forconcession over the prorogation of the Legislative Assembly.*Royal Instructions8. &quot; Clause 13 (1). The Governor may, after consultation with the Chief Minister,by directions in writing, establish a committee of the Council of Ministers(hereinafter in this clause referred to as &quot; the Committee &quot;) to exercise such functions of the Council as he may specify in the said directions andat any time when there is a committee so established any law authorising the Council of Ministers to exercise the functions so specified shall beconstrued and have effect as if the references therein to the Council of
Ministers were references to such Committee: Provided however that no decision of any such Committee shall be regarded as a decision of theCouncil of Ministers unless and until it has been ratified by the Council ofMinisters.2. The Committee shall consist of such persons, being Members ofthe Council of Ministers, as the Governor may, by directions in writing,appoint either by name or by reference to their offices; and any such person who shall be appointed by name shall, subject to the provisions ofthis clause, hold his seat in the Committee for such period as may be prescribed by any such directions.&quot;Comment. This relates to the setting up and functions of a committee or committees of the Council of Ministers. If the Governors discretion were abandoned in this matter it would be possible for the Chief Minister to oblige theGovernor (subject, of course, to the Governor^ use of the reserved executive power) to delegate to a committee of the Council the consideration of important matters. It would also be possible (subject, of course, to the exercise by theGovernor of his reserved executive power) to exclude from the committee any ofthe ex-officio Ministers since the Governor^ power to appoint members of thecommittee under Clause 13 (2) would be one of the matters on which he would be bound under Section 19 of the Order in Council to consult the Council of ministers and to follow their advice. This point could therefore only be conceded if theGovernor were given power to appoint to such committees any Minister whom he considered to be directly affected by their deliberations.
