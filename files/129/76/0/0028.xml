(T^HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL,C,P.(55) 73 COPY NO.   ^%16th July, 1955CABINETRELATIONS WITH THE independent television AUTHORITYNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach a note setting out recommendations on what should be the broad relationship between Government Departments on the one hand andthe Independent Television Authority (I.T.A.) and its programme contractorson the other.    The note has been drawn up after discussions with all departmental Chief Information or Public Relations Officers, and has their agreement.    I ask my colleagues to endorse its recommendations.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.15th July, 1955.RELATIONS WITH THE independent television AUTHORITY\Government Facilities for Independent Television AuthorityProgrammesWhen four programme companies and Independent Television NewsLimited (formed to supply picture news to all programme companies) areadded to the newspapers and the B.B.C., the pressure on the time ofinformation staffs and others of Government Departments will be very heavy.    It may not be physically possible to arrange all the facilities which may be requested.    Nevertheless, the I.T.A. is a statutoryorganisation and, within the limits of available resources, it would be right to start by treating its programme and news companies on an equal footing with the B.B.C. and cinema newsreels.    (When the application ismade by a sub-contractor of free-lance producer, Departments will use their discretion, judging the standing of the producer and his access toI.T.A. programmes. )   This should be done as a matter of practice.    But,since it is impossible to foresee just how the relationship will develop,it will be advisable, while experience is gained and in order to preservesome freedom of action, not to declare parity of treatment as a principleat the outset.

-hit2. Moreover, the opportunity should be taken of getting the best possible terms for further use by the official information services ofI.T.A. films produced with official help.    It is therefore suggested that.&quot;(a) &quot;When a Department provides facilities for a programme ornews company it should be clear to what uses the resultingfilm is to be put by the company.    No doubt programme contractors and the Independent Television News Companywill develop links with television networks overseas.    Thisis to be welcomed since it will provide additional channelsfor oversea distribution without cost to Her Majesty,sGovernment.    But the Government may later wish to distribute some of these films in countries which theywould not reach commercially, and must be protected against excessive charges for the right to distributefilms which have been made possible, in the first place,by the granting of official facilities .    Further, Depart-ments will wish to safeguard themselves against improperuse of the material.(b) It should be stipulated that the material will be madeavailable to the Department and the Central Office ofInformation (C.O.I.) if required as footage for libraryuse at reasonable rates (i. e. , the same rates as arealready agreed with the B.B.C.).If these two points are accepted by all the Departments concerned, theycould best be met by a collective approach to the I.T.A. companies withthe object of an agreement covering all facilities.3. At the same time, programme companies should be asked in allcases to:- -(i)     take exceptional and continual steps to ensure that there isno awkward or embarrassing juxtaposition between advertis-ing &quot;spots&quot; and following or preceding programmes forwhich official facilities have been given or in which aCrown servant appears;(ii)     make requests for the appearance of a civil servant orserving officer to the Department and not to the officerdirect;(iii)    take special care in the rehearsal and presentation ofcivil servants, in order to avoid not only reducing theinformation&apos;value of the programme but also damagingthe prestige of the Department and the Civil Service.$)and^:Foints Jbf and Jef have already been put to the B.B.C.J which has promisedits co-operation.    A draft Treasury circular on uCivil Servants on television and Sound Radio&quot; has been discussed with the National staff side and is now the subject of further consideration by departmentalestablishment officers.
12th July, 1955.4.        There would be considerable advantage in getting uniform practiceamong Departments on charges for providing library material and complete films to I.T.A,, contractors.    It is agreed that this might usefully be discussed between the Departments concerned and the FilmsDivision of the C. O. I, , which already has a scale of charges for these purposes.Official Photographs5.        Crown copyright still photographs required by I.T.A. companies for programme use should be charged for at the same rates as are charged for other television uses.    For use in advertisements higher rates shouldbe charged.    No acknowledgment should be required.    (The C.O. I.Photographic Library is mainly affected and minimum rates andconditions are to be discussed by the Departments concerned with the photographs Division prior to negotiations with the association represent-ing I.T.A. companies. )Advertising &quot;Spots&quot;6,       A distinction has to be made between programmes and advertisingintervals.    Advertising agents may approach Departments for facilitiesor for film material in connection with advertising &quot;spots&quot;, possiblysuggesting that there will be departmental advantage in association withthe advertisements.7.        The majority of Public Relations Officers are against anygeneral rule that the Government should give no assistance in fillingadvertisement &quot;spots&quot;; it is suggested that each Department must make its own decision as a matter of policy, and ensure that official material is used only in conditions and surroundings which it approves.    Thelatter course would follow that now adopted in the case of press advertise-ments; but the problems which will arise from television advertisingwill be much more severe.8.        If official film material or photographs are supplied, normal commercial rates, which for these purposes are high, should be charged,.This also can usefully be discussed between the Departments involved andthe C. O. I. when the principle is cleared.Government Advertising9.        The Government cannot use an expensive new medium until itseffectiveness can be gauged.    It will be necessary to demonstrate that money spent on advertising on television would be more effectively usedthan the same amount spent on advertising in another medium.    Advicewill be taken from,the media experts - the advertising agents- but itmust be some time before evidence oh which to base a judgment can beavailable.    In any event, because of the political significance of such astep, Ministerial authority will be sought before time is first booked.
