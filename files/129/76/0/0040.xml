secret.P.(55) 9023rd July, 1955NATIONAL SERVICE: SCIENCE TEACHERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Minister of Labour and National service on. 18th July we were invited by the Sub-Committee of the HomeAffairs Committee on the Supply of Scientists to submit a paper to theCabinet about the deferment of scientists.2.        The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Educationhave asked that deferment should be granted to&apos;those 1st and 2nd classhonours graduates in science and mathematics who are prepared to take up teaching and so long as they remain satisfactorily employed in thatoccupation.3.        This proposal cannot be considered, however, without regardto the general deferment situation.    There has been a steady increase inthe number of deferments granted for scientists and engineers, mainly in connection with work of high priority on the defence programme:  thenumber granted annually has increased from 107 in 1950 to 899 in 1954, andthe number of applications is continuing to increase.    In addition, thereare new claims for deferment, for example, for scientists on work on the nuclear power programme and on research for the Coal Board.    At this rate, in a few years more scientists may be deferred for civilian employ-ment than go into the Forces and it would become impossible to claim thatthe principle of universality of service was being maintained,4.        The general view of the Sub-Committee was that a ceiling shouldbe fixed limiting the total number of deferments that might be granted forall civilian purposes other than teaching.    Within this ceiling some kindof system would have to be devised for allocating the deferments amongthe various interests concerned.5.       As regards deferment for school-teachers, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Minister of Education have represented that because of the difficulty of distinguishing between the merits of differentschools, they could not operate a quota system in this field.    In view ofthis, the general opinion of the Sub-Committee was that indefinite defermentshould be granted to 1st and 2nd class honours graduates in science andmathematics who are prepared to take up teaching in a school which is either maintained or aided out of public funds or recognised as efficientin England and. Wales, or which the Education Ministers think should be similarly treated for this purpose.    While no precise estimate can bemade of the number of deferments that might be granted under this arrange-ment, it has been estimated that the number might be about 75 in 1956,COPY NO.cabinet

i 6.       We recommend that, as regards deferment for purposes otherthan teaching, a ceiling should be established to limit the total number ofdeferments for such purposes, and that an Official Working Party shouldbe set up to consider on what basis such a ceiling should be established,and to advise on the ways and means, such as a quota system for different users, by which the ceiling might be made effective.7,        On the question of deferment for teachers, we recognise thedifficulty of the Education Ministers in attempting to discriminate between schools.    On the other hand, it would embarrass the Minister ofLabour if in this one part of the scientific field, deferment were to begranted without any limit whatsoever, and particularly if this were publicly announced.    We recommend, therefore, that the public announcement should say simply that favourable consideration will be given to defermentfor this purpose.    It is not expected that the numbers of applications fordeferment in 1956 will greatly exceed the figures given in paragraph 5above, but if it appears that they are likely much to exceed 100 in thatyear, there should be consultation between the Education Departments andthe Ministry of Labour.    We understand that there is to be a debate inthe House of Commons on 26th July on Scottish Education, and that theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State will be pressed to make a state&quot;ment on the recommendations of the Appleton Committee about defermentfor science and mathematics teachers.    We suggest that he should make astatement in the terms of the attached draft.    The arrangements proposedin this paragraph have been agreed with the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Education.W.W.M.23rd Julv, 1955.annex draft of a Statement to be made by theParliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor ScotlandIt has been decided that as from next year, 1956,favourable consideration will be given to indefinitedeferment of 1st and 2nd class honours graduates in science and mathematics who take up teaching in a school which is either maintained or aided out of public funds, or which inthe view of my Rt. Hon. Friend should be similarly treated for this purpose.    In England and Wales similar arrange-ments will be made which will include schools recognised as efficient.
