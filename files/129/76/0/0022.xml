United States-Chinese RelationsWhen I saw Mr. Nehru off at the airport to-night I told him that we had hada message from the United States Government telling us the text of the President^message to Mr. Nehru which they rightly supposed we might have discussedtogether. The message went on to ask us to convey the communication to theChinese contained therein to Mr. Chou-en-Lai. As Mr. Nehru would be awareit was our task to look after United States interests in China, and that being sowe were just being used as an intermediary. Mr. Nehru said he quite understoodand that of course we had no choice.2. I said that we would, however, before sending a message tell the Americansof our doubts as to the value of that particular approach and if Mr. Nehru wanted to express his views I thought it would be useful if he could do so within thenext day or two in Washington. I continued that I thought that the americans were in part prompted by the desire to get some kind of conversation going withthe Chinese before the Geneva talks, in the hope that this would make it easier to handle Chinese affairs there.3. Mr. Nehru said he fully understood this but that everything of courseturned on whether their communication was sufficiently helpful to keep thingsmoving, or was interpreted by the Chinese as the end of the discussion.  I agreed.Indo-China4. Mr. Nehru said that he wondered whether I would consider the possibilityof calling together the two Permanent Chairmen of the Geneva Conference andthe representatives of the International Commission in the near future. he understood that it might not be possible to do this at Geneva. At the same time he would be glad if I would think the question over. He understood that theCanadian Government were in favour of such a meeting and that there were anumber of questions to review. I said that I would consider this and discuss thematter further with Mr. Pearson when he came.A. E.10th July, 1955.\

EgyptMr. Nehru said that he was going to Cairo that night and would have theopportunity for a talk to Nasser. He was not quite sure what was the best linefor him to take with Nasser in the circumstances. Had I any suggestions to make?2. I said that General Burns had been trying very hard to bring Egypt and israel together to reduce tension at Gaza. My impression was that the main difficulty in the situation was that Nasser would not appoint a sufficiently senior officer to negotiate effectively with the Israelis. Could not Mr. Nehru press himto do this? It was not in Nasser&apos;s interest that tension should continue. Mr. Nehrusaid he agreed with this and he felt fairly confident that Nasser would also.Unfortunately he had some wild men round him who were apt to say foolish things.He would, however, bear in mind what I said when he saw Nasser.A. E.10th July, 1955.
