(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C.P.(55) 73        . COPY NO.   g 313th July, 1955CABINETROAD HAULAGE DISPOSALSMemorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil AviationAs invited by the Cabinet on 7th July, I submit for approval theattached draft of an announcement of the decision to bring road haulagedisposals to an end (C. M. (55) 21st Conclusions, Minute 5).2.       As I understand this decision no change in the present status ofBritish Road Services is involved.    I fully agree with this view.3.        It would, theoretically, be possible to carry out our policy of leaving British Road Services as the operators of the road haulage trunkroutes while altering their status either by constituting them a separatenationalised corporation or by converting them into a companyj possiblypartly owned by the British Transport Commission (alternative (c) inparagraph 14 of C.P. (55) 62).4.        I see no advantage in either of these courses.    The creation ofa new nationalised industry, with a new Board, would not only be politicallysomewhat embarrassing, but would make no contribution to efficiency andwould result&apos;merely in superimposing a Board and Secretariat on theexisting organisation.5V&apos;      I do not think we could sell all the shares in a British road services company.    It is going to be difficult enough to sell the shares inthe parcels company and I would not wish to divert what investment is available to a new company.    A partly owned company presents thefundamental difficulty of control.    If the Transport Commission is toretain control there would be no change of management and the only result would be, in respect of the minority holding of shares, to transfera remunerative investment from the Transport Commission to the City.6.       If the Transport Commission were to retain 49 per cent of the shares it would exercise de facto control unless the whole of the remainder were transferred to a single individual or body, e. g. by setting up a holding company.    This might well be criticised on the grounds that itdenied opportunity for the ordinary investor to participate and deprivedthe Government of the chance of getting the highest possible price forthe shares.    Nor do I see what practical advantage would in thesecircumstances result from leaving the Transport Commission as alarge minority shareholder.
7.        It is worth recalling that the Transport Act, 1953, proposed toleave British Road Services with some 3,500 vehicles, and to leave BritishRoad Services as a part of the Transport Commission.    I do not think thatthe validity of the conclusions on which that decision was based are in any degree varied as a result of increasing the vehicles retained from 3,500 to,say, 8,000.8.        I have drafted the statement therefore on the basis that theCabinet assumed no alteration in the position of British Road Services.But as the point may be raised in subsequent discussion, I felt that ought to invite my colleagues&apos; attention to the alternatives open though I,myself, regard them as undesirable for the reasons stated.9.        I would suggest that this statement, if approved, be made onWednesday, 20th July.J.A.B . **G.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W.l.12th July, 1955.DRAFT statement as I informed the House on the 11th July during the debate on theAnnual Report of the British Transport Commission, Her Majesty*sGovernment have been giving consideration to the position which has beenreached in the disposal under the Transport Act, 1953, of the road haulageinterests of the British Transport Commission.2.        Her Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that the objects of theTransport Act, 1953, in this respect have been achieved.    The 25 mile limit on private hauliers has been abolished; vehicles operated by theBritish Transport Commission have been placed under the licensing system of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933;  and considerable progress has been made with the disposal of vehicles owned by the british transport Commission.3.        Of the 32,500 vehicles originally thought to be available for disposal,^ current disposal figure to be inserted^ vehicles have been soldmainly in small units.    In addition the parcels company with 4,000 vehicleswill be put on offer under Section 5 of the Act in October, and arrangements have been made for dealing between now and the end of next year with theCommission^ 2,000 contract hire vehicles.
4.        When allowance is made for a small number of vehicles whichare for one reason or another unsaleable, there remain for disposal underthe Act of 1953 some 8,000 vehicles.    The majority of these are at present used to operate the Commissions trunk services.    These services have developed substantially in scope and efficiency during the last year or two,and are rendering a good service to industry and commerce.    In thesecircumstances Her Majesty^ Government have come to the conclusionthat it would be wrong to sell off the vehicles required to operate these services, and that these services should continue to be operated by BritishRoad Services.5.        Her Majesty!s Government have asked the Disposal   Board toadvise them as to the number of vehicles required to be retained for thispurpose over and above the total of 3,500 vehicles for all purposesalready authorised for retention under the Act of 1953.    Before theadvice of the Disposal Board is received I cannot state precisely what this number will be but the information at present before me suggeststhat this may involve increasing the number of vehicles to be retained by British Road Services by some 4,500.6.        Her Majesty&apos;s Government have asked the Disposal   Board toput up for sale as quickly as possible the balance of the vehicles still held by the Commission which are available for disposal and notrequired for retention to operate the trunk services.    These vehicles willbe offered for sale in a list or lists to be put up for sale in the nearfuture.    At least one list containing small units suitable for purchase by the small operator will be offered.    All other arrangements previouslyannounced will be carried out.7. Legislation will, of course, be necessary as a result of thisdecision, and Her Majesty^ Government propose to lay a Bill beforeParliament in the autumn.
