a lb C lie iS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(69)1357th October, 1969CABINETINDUSTRIAL POLICY; AN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS bill memorandum by the Firofc Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Employment and productivity in my memorandum (C( 9) 123) I recommended the introduction of a&quot;limited Bill&quot; to give effect to those proposals in the White Paper &quot;In Placeof Strife&quot; which were directed primarily to protect the individual employee.I suggested that a Bill of this nature was to be preferred, on the one hand,to more comprehensive legislation and, on the other, to no Bill at all.In paragraph 34 of that memorandum, however, I drew attention to someof the disadvantages of a limited Bill; and I undertook to report further on the problems which would confront us in taking a measure of this kindthrough Parliament.    I think it only right to take this early opportunity of warning my colleagues that recent discussions I have had, and advice Ihave received, have increased my doubts about the advisability of introducing a limited Bill.2.      First of all, I have been warned that the scope of a limited Bill onthe lines I recommended could not be relied upon to be proof against askilful and determined effort to open it to a wide-ranging debate at theCommittee stage because individual employer-employee relations andcollective bargaining can not be regarded as completely separate Issues.There would, I am advised, be ample opportunity for members to introduceamendments on many, if not most, of the proposals included in the white paper which were excluded from the Bill.    We should therefore have toexplain to our supporters why they should not move or resist amendments which were entirely in accordance with the policy of the White Paper andwould have to engage In debate on ground which we had not ourselveschosen in circumstances which would be likely to cause us considerableembarrassment.3.      Secondly, we should naturally need to justify a decision to introduce a limited measure which omitted a number of proposals in the White Paper.This justification would have to be in terms which made it clear that theGovernment was withholding from the unions a number of statutory changes-1-COPY NO,
which would be to their advantage until it could be seen whether the tradeunion movement could discharge, without public supervision, theobligations it had undertaken.    I think the Labour Party Conference hasunderlined the fact that such an explanation would be bitterly resented bythe Trades Union Congress (TUC) in its present highly sensitive frame of mind.4.      I argued in my earlier memorandum that a comprehensive Billgiving effect to the White Paper would be open to the objection that, in theabsence of any provisions to supervise crade union rules and behaviour,it would be overwhelmingly favourable to the trade union interest.    It iscertainly true that a comprehensive Bill would include a number of provisions intended to strengthen the hand of the trade unions (notably theright to recognition, the obligation on employers to disclose information and protection for inducement of breach of a commercial contract in thecircumstances of a trade dispute); but a comprehensive Bill would alsocover matters on which the TUC had expressed reservations (for example,the proposed amendments to Section 4(4) of the 1871 Trade Union Act and to section 4 of the 1906 Trade Disputes Act to enable a union to be sued in tortexcept in the circumstances of a trade dispute, on the first of which inparticular there might well be TUC resistance).    It would also include provisions for which the TUC have expressed little enthusiasm (for example,the Trade Union Development Scheme and the establishment of theCommission o&amp; Industrial Relations as a statutory body) but which can be defended as both useful and desirable on their own merits,    A comprehensiveBill could not therefore be attacked as a competely unbalanced &quot;trade unioncharter&quot;,5,      In the light of all these considerations I now believe that thebalance cf advantage lies in the direction of a comprehensive Bill giving effect to those proposals in the White Paper not ruled out as a result of the18th June agreement with the TUC (that 13 to say, alternative (ii) inparagraph 28 of the earlier memorandum).    The TUC consider that theagreement precludes legislation on trade union registration and rules andthe establishment of an independent review body to hear complaints by individual trade unionists.    On registration, I am clear this cannot beincluded in a Bill.    The same probably applies to legislation relating tocomplaints by trade unionists even If I cannot persuade the TUC to set up its own appeals body, which I shall try to do.conclusion.      I recommend the introduction of legislation which would give effectto the proposals outlined in the White Paper, with the exception of thosewhich would involve penal sanctions against a trade union or an employee,and which could therefore be construed as a breach of the June agreement by the TUC.Department of Employment and Productivity, S.W.I.7th October, 1969
