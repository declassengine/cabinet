IINTRODUCTIONSCOPE AND PURPOSE1. The purpose of the White Paper is to increase public understanding and knowledge of the prison service of England and Wales. It is clearly right that both Parliament and the public should be fully informed about the aims, achieve-ments and problems of any public service and be in a position to form their own judgement of what is being done in their name. To this end, the Government isproviding this portrait of our prisons in a form which, though it cannot claim togive the full picture, is more authoritative than a descriptive pamphlet and. morewide-ranging than an annual report.2. It records many substantial changes in our prisons in the post war years, andcomes at a lime when the Government is embarked on an expanding programmeof expenditure and has undertaken a complete overhaul of the structure of the prison Department. Recent developments in the modernisation, rationalisationand. expansion of prison industries, the improved relationship between prisoners and staff, and other developments here described, have brought the prison service to a position from which it can hopefully look forward, to a period of innovationand constructive advance. Accordingly, in the pages which follow, the aim willbe not only to take stock of what has been achieved but also to try to point theway ahead.THE PLAN OF THE WHITE papers. This White Paper cannot give a full description of the work of the prison service in all its aspects; it aims merely to present a balanced and not uncriticalpicture. Part II outlines the tasks of the service and briefly summarises the back-ground to its work. Part 111 examines in more detail what is involved in thetreatment of offenders in custody, and includes a condensed report of what hasbeen done in the last few years to improve the quality of medical and psychiatrictreatment, remedial and. higher education, vocational training and groupcounselling in prisons and borstals, together with present achievements and.future plans for prison industries. Some of the most important of the recent developments concern a new emphasis on the help and. supervision available tooffenders after release. Part IV of the Paper therefore describes the links betweenthe offender and the community, outlines the work of the probation and after-care service in helping offenders and. their families during and after a period in
custody, and summarises the promising results from the first year of the newparole scheme, introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1967. Part V includesinformation about the records of different groups of offenders after release anddiscusses the present and future contribution of research to our knowledge of the effectiveness of the work of the prison service.4. Part VI describes the strategy of the prison system: it describes, that is tosay, the different types of institutions dealing with different groups of offendersand summarises the Governments plans for each group. It refers to the changesbeing made in the branch of the system that deals with women and girls; and itexplains why the Government is initiating a full inquiry into the form of custodynow appropriate for young offenders under 21. It describes the role of the localprison and the very difficult problem of the containment of maximum securityprisoners. The strategy of the prison system is shaped by its buildings, many ofwhich are grossly overcrowded, and most of which are obsolescent. Part VIsets out the Governments plans for an expanding building programme and forgiving a fresh impetus to the modernisation and redevelopment of outdated andunsuitable buildings.5. There are 15,000 men and women in the prison service. Part VII of theWhite Paper gives as comprehensive an account as is possible within a briefcompass of the different groups of staff working together in the service, andemphasises in particular the changing role of the prison officer. It also describes the current re-organisation of the central and regional administration of the prison Department.6. Finally, Part VIII aims to bring all the threads together. It indicates whatthe Government considers to have been the most significant of the recent develop-ments in the work of the service, what are the major problems now facing itand what are the Governments plans for the development of the service in thenext few years.
GLOSSARYThose not familiar with the details of our prison system may find it useful tohave the following brief explanations of terms used in the White Paper. Theyare not intended as comprehensive legal definitions: those who need suchdefinitions will normally have access to books in which they may be found.Adult OffenderA person over the age of 21 when convicted.After-CareThe support and supervision given to an offender after release from custody.All young offenders and some adult offenders (see paragraph 104) are subject to compulsory after-care. This is after-care given to an offender by aprobation officer during the period after release when he is liable to be recalled to custody if in breach of the conditions on which he was released.Voluntary after-care is the support available to other offenders after releaseif they choose to accept it.Borstal TrainingA court may sentence a young offender to borstal training if he is convicted ofan offence for which an adult offender may be sent to prison and if the courtconsiders that he should receive training for at least six months. The period in custody depends on the response to training but cannot exceed two years.OosedA closed borstal or closed prison is one surrounded by a wall and/or fence asa barrier to escape.Detention CentreAn institution to which young offenders may be sent after conviction of an offence for which an adult may be sent to prison. The sentence is normallythree months but can go up to six months. (See paragraphs 149-150).Halfway HouseAnother term for an after-care hostel (see below).HostelThe term is used in different contexts in the White Paper.The Hostel Scheme is a term often used to describe the arrangements out-lined in paragraph 98 under which certain adult offenders may live in part ofa prison set aside as a hostel but go out to work for an outside employerduring the last six months of a sentence.After-Care Hostels (see paragraph 111) are those provided by voluntary organisations for homeless offenders who require some degree of socialsupport, often immediately after release from custody.
Indictable OffencesThese include all serious criminal offences against the person or property. Anindictable offence is one for which the accused may be (and has a right to be)committed to a higher court (assize or quarter sessions) for trial before a jury.Some of the most serious indictable offences must be tried at a higher court.The great majority of indictable offences can be, and are, dealt with in magis-trates&apos; courts.InmateAny person of any age held in custody in an institution for which the PrisonDepartment is responsible, whether in a prison, borstal, remand centre or detention-tion centre.Parole scheme a term used to describe the arrangements outlined in paragraph 114 underwhich the Parole Board may recommend to the Home Secretary the release of a prisoner after he has served part of his sentence. A prisoner released in this wayis subject to compulsory after-care while on licence.OpenAn open borstal or open prison is one with no physical barrier designed toprevent absconding.PrisonsDescriptions of the role of various types of prisons are given in Part VI of theWhite Paper.A Local Prison is one to which adults and some people under 21 are sentdirect from the courts either when remanded in custody before trial, or afterconviction or sentence. All local prisons are closed and the great majorityof prisoners in them sleep in cells.A Training Prison is one to which sentenced prisoners are transferred afterinitial assessment in a local prison. Such a prison may be either open orclosed.PrisonerThe term normally used for adults in custody. A young prisoner is a person under 21 who serves a sentence in a prison and not in a borstal or detentioncentre.Remand CentreA special institution (see paragraph 147) designed to hold people, especially those under 21, awaiting trial or in the period immediately after conviction orsentence.Visiting Committee and Board of VisitorsA Visiting Committee is a body of magistrates appointed for each local prison(and remand centre) by courts which commit people to that prison. A Board ofVisitors is a body of men and women, some of whom must be magistrates,
appointed by the Home Secretary at each training prison, borstal or detentioncentre. These Committees or Boards have a general responsibility to satisfy themselves about the state of the buildings, the administration of the establish-ment and the treatment of inmates. They report annually to the Home Secretary.They have certain disciplinary powers in relation to serious breaches of discipline,hear applications or complaints from offenders and provide a valuable contact between the local community and the institution.VisitorsPrison visitors are private citizens appointed to a prison by the Home Office onthe recommendation of the governor to visit and befriend prisoners. (See para-graph 94).Young OffenderAn offender under 21 at the time of conviction. Most of the young offenderswith whom the prison service has to deal are 17 or over and this White Paperdoes not deal with the general treatment of those under 17. But some young people aged 15 or 16 may be sent to remand centres or sentenced to borstaltraining, and there are junior detention centres (see footnote to paragraph 149)for offenders aged 14-17.pr a*
IITHE TASK OF THE PRISON SERVICEAIMS AND PURPOSESPRISONS AND THE PENAL SYSTEM7. We start from the point at which people enter prison, omitting such earlier stages as the detection of crime and the place of the courts or the criminal law inour society. We shall consider what happens to the fifteen hundred or more peoplecommitted to custody every week, and the staffing and organisation of theprisons, borstals, detention and remand centres in England and Wales to whichthey are sent. Every week another fifteen hundred people are released fromcustody. Society expects these to knit together once more the scattered strands oftheir life in the community. The White Paper therefore deals with parole andafter-care, which are now regarded as an integral part of the whole penal system.8. Despite this concentration on the penal system and what happens to thoseoffenders who are convicted and committed to custody, it is important to emphasize that the prison system is only part of a whole process of socialrehabilitation. Its work has to be seen as contributing to one overriding purpose;and that purpose is the protection of society.9. The part played by the prison service in the treatment of offenders mustfollow the part played by the courts. It is true that members of the service makereports to the courts, and that these may properly influence what happens toan offender, but no member of the service has any authority to decide whether a citizen should or should not be sentenced to imprisonment. Nor, with someexceptions in the case of detention centres, has the service any control over thetotal number of people committed to its custody. The service cannot put up a&quot;house full&quot; notice, tempted though some governors of local prisons may havebeen to do so in recent years.PRISONS AND SOCIETY10. Penal institutions, on the other hand, do not exist in isolation. They form part of our society. So do all members of the prison service and all people in custody. A great deal follows from these principles. Everyone in custody expects to return sooner or later to the community, the average stay in custody afterconviction being less than twelve months. It follows that what happens to people in custody must always be planned with conditions after release in mind. It alsofollows that the probation and after-care service, which helps in a person&apos;s pre-paration for release and provides continued support and guidance when hereturns to society, sometimes for years, sometimes for life, should be closely
associated with such plans. It is because of the close and growing associationof the two services that the part played by the probation and after-care service will be a constantly recurring theme in this Paper.11. Members of the prison service expect and must be given working con-ditions in prison which compare with those to be obtained in other occupationsin society: conditions that were normal and acceptable fifty years ago will not be acceptable now. The same is true of the living and working conditions ofprisoners. Standards thought adequate fifty years ago would be thought inde-fensible today and not only material standards. Men and women do not cease to be human beings when they are convicted or when they are sent to prison.The moral standards by which society lives apply to the treatment of offendersin custody. The prison service is a part of the community, and must reflect thecommunity&apos;s own moral concepts. It should therefore receive its due share ofthe resources of the community in carrying out its work.THE AIMS OF THE SERVICE12. The prison service cannot make the best use of the resources available toit unless it is clear about its aims. The service is both large and complex, employ-ing 15,000 men and women in 111 different establishments, and responsible for35,000 people in custody. Few large organisations have only one aim, and it oftenobscures the real situation to try to bring all the activities of any one of themwithin one simple formula or slogan. Some of the confusion felt about the aims of the prison service arises from attempts to do so.13. Those aims can best be summarised as follows. First, it is the task of theservice, under the law, to hold those committed to custody and to provide con-ditions for their detention which are currently acceptable to society. Second, indealing with convicted offenders, there is an obligation on the service to do allthat may be possible within the currency of the sentence &quot;to encourage and assist them to lead a good and useful life&quot;.*14. One possible source of confusion should be cleared up. The general aimsdefined in the previous paragraph govern the treatment of all convicted offendersand do not vary according to the reasons for which the courts send any one person to custody. A court may properly pass a custodial sentence on oneoffender to act as a general deterrent to the commission of crime, and on anotherbecause the court believes he is in need of training that can be given to him in custody. The duty of the prison service in respect of each of them remainsunaffected.LIVING CONDITIONS15. The first task of the service, &quot;humane containment&quot;, may appear a prosaicand limited one. With the large and constantly changing population of our over-crowded Victorian prisons it is not an easy one. This said, it must be admitted that in some respects the conditions of a prisoners daily life fall short of what*See Rule 1 of the Prison Rules 1964.
society would currently approve. Later Parts of this White Paper describe someof the measures being taken to raise standards to a more acceptable level. Thereare critics of present policies who argue that the provision of better living con-ditions for prisoners is wrong. They feel that imprisonment should deliberatelybe made a harsh and disagreeble experience, and that such harshness is a neces-sary deterrent to the commission of crime by others or of further crime by theman being punished. This criticism is mistaken. Imprisonment is by its natureunpleasant. One of John Heywood&apos;s &quot;Proverbs&quot; runs: &quot;No man loveth hisfetters, be they made of gold&quot;. The deterrent effect of imprisonment lies in theloss of liberty it involves, and in the restrictions inherent in any prison regime.There is no reason to suppose that it would be made more effective by revertingto such barbarities as the treadmill. On the contrary, measures designed to preserve and enhance a man&apos;s dignity and self-respect are most likely to assist inhis rehabilitation.SECURITY16. Another very different criticism of present policies is also heard. It is thatemphasis on security on the prevention of crime during sentence by preventingescapes from custody must hamper the longer term prevention of crime by making more difficult the task of rehabilitation. Security is, of course, one of theimportant factors to be weighed in making some decisions about an offender in deciding, for example, if he should be sent to an open prison or borstal. If an institution holds offenders who need to be contained within secure conditionsthere are inevitable restrictions that have to be placed on the activities that can take place inside it. But the simple antithesis of security versus rehabilitation isfalse. One does not vary in inverse proportion to the other. In every modernpenal system yet conceived some offenders must be kept in secure conditions.There is no reason in logic or experience to suggest that a &quot;secure&quot; institutionfrom which an escape can in fact be made is better, whether in terms of its dailyregime or in terms of the training of the offender, than an institution from which no one escapes. Indeed, there is some reason, including the experience of othercountries, to suggest that an institution in which the staff have full confidence inthe security arrangements can develop a more relaxed atmosphere and can there-fore provide a better regime than one in which the staff are continually worriedabout possible escapes.17. For many years before 1966 insufficient resources had been devoted to themaintenance of the security of our closed prisons, and in the last three years ithas channelled time and money away from other matters. Security had to take precedence, and the number of escapes from closed prisons was reduced to abouta quarter of what it was in the years before 1966. Many of the deficiencies setout in Lord Mountbatten&apos;s Report* on prison security have now been remedied.The Government believe that the further development of the security measuresdescribed in Part VI of this Paper, together with the better classification of offenders according to the degree of security they need, will enable the purelycustodial aspect of the prevention of crime to be seen in its proper relationship as one element, but only one, in the tasks of the prison service.*Report of the Inquiry into Prison Escapes and Security, Cmnd. 3175. (1966)
REHABILITATION18. The &quot;humane containment&quot; of offenders cannot be the sole task of the prison service. If, as the late Sir Alexander Paterson put it, prison is seen only asa cloakroom in which the enemy of society is duly deposited till called for after a fixed period, the protection afforded to society is temporary and the offender mayreturn to the community more embittered and anti-social than before. It hasbeen the aim of the service, since the turn of the century, to attempt the more constructive and more difficult task of releasing offenders who, in the well knownwords of the Gladstone Committee*, might be &quot;better men and women, physic-ally and morally, than when they came in&quot;. A variety of terms, reflecting the complexity and uncertainty of the task, have been used to describe this attempt:reformation, re-education, treatment, training, rehabilitation. Later Parts of this white Paper describe some of the ways in which it is now being tackled, showinghow the treatment of an offender in custody must be viewed as a whole, and howall aspects of the work of the prison service must contribute to a common aim.19. Nor can the prison service tackle the task of rehabilitation unaided. It needsthe help of members of the community who can assist the offender both while he is in custody and after release; and this must involve a wide range of voluntary and statutory services. It needs, for example, the help of various local authoritydepartments, of the Department of Health and Social Security and of the Depart-ment of Employment and Productivity. Above all it needs to work in closepartnership with the probation and after-care service. Later Parts of this white paper indicate how that partnership has begun to develop in the last few years,through the appointment of members of the probation and after-care service toserve as prison welfare officers, through the better exchange of ideas and infor-mation, and through the release of a greater number of offenders into the com-munity for supervision by members of that service.eport from the Departmental Committee on Prisons, 1895.9
THE SOMBRE BACKGROUND20. The work of the prison service has greatly increased in both size and complexity in the last twenty-five years; and the recorded rise in crime has provided a sombre background throughout. There is no one measure that can betaken of the rise in crime but the following diagram shows, as one example ofit, the increase in the number of people found guilty of indictable offences.Persons found guilty of indictable offences 1938-1968250,000200,000150,000&apos;100,00050,0001938 1943 1948 1953 1958 1963 1968The figures it shows should be compared (and never confused) with the much larger figure of indictable offences known to the police to have been committed.In 1968 that figure was 1,289,090*.21. Most offenders are not sent to custody by the courts after conviction.Nearly half the 195,000 offenders of 17 or over convicted of indictable offencesin 1968 were fined. Less than one in five received a custodial sentence althoughanother 12 per cent, received suspended sentences of imprisonment. The follow-ing diagram gives the detailed figures and shows the effect of the criminla justice Act 1967 in reducing the proportion of offenders sent to prison, especially for short periods.

INCREASE IN NUMBERS22. Nevertheless for every one offender in custody before the war there are nowthree. For every two offenders in custody in 1950 there are now three. Thefollowing diagram shows how great the increase has been.RECEPTIONS AND POPULATIONNote: Up to and including 1949 the graph of receptions relates to allreceptions on conviction.

The diagram shows both &quot;receptions&quot; and &quot;population&quot;. The line for &quot;recep-tions&quot; shows the total number of people committed to custody after sentenceduring the year. The line for &quot;population&quot; shows the total number of people in custody at any one time (the figure used being the average for the year). Thisaverage population obviously varies not only with the number of &quot;receptions&quot;but also with the average length of sentence, or period in custody on remand. the relationship between these factors is discussed in the note on page gj. It showsthat the increases which have taken place in the average length of prison sentenceare largely accounted for by the fact that a smaller number of people are nowsent to prison for very short periods.THE SIZE OF THE SERVICE23. There are now about 35,000 people in custody compared with about 20,000in 1950. About 9,000 of them are sleeping two or three in a cell compared with ,000 in 1950. During the same period the total number of staff employed inthe prison service has increased from 5,500 to 15,000 and the total annual expenditure, capital as well as current, from under  6 million to about  50million a year. The Prison Department is now responsible for 111 institutionscompared with 57 in 1950.THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TASK24. The work of the prison service is inherently complex because a prison mustbe, in most respects, a micro-copy of the world outside. People live, eat, work andsleep in prison. There must be hospitals, chapels, classrooms and workshopswithin the perimeter of the prison, as within the confines of other &quot;total&quot;institutions. There is the further responsibility for security. &quot;Rehabilitation&quot;itself is complex. There is no such person as the average offender. How should there be when all human beings are different? All generalisations about the characteristics of people in custody are therefore suspect. (There are exceptionseven to the generalisation that people in custody are there unwillingly). the prison service has to deal with offenders, some of whom are dangerous andmany of whom are afflicted by emotional and personality disturbance and social inadequacies. It is also true that the prison service has to cope with manywith whom other social agencies have in some way failed.25. These inherent complexities are not new, although we are becoming increasingly conscious of the task of rehabilitation in relation to them. There isnow a wide variety of penal institutions: remand centres, detention centres,borstals and prisons for those under 21 and both open and closed prisons for those over 21. Increasingly, moreover, the service aims to provide a range ofregimes even within one type of institution and has to assess the suitability of offenders for transfer from one to another. Obviously it is simpler to organise a prison in which the inmates are held in solitary confinement than one in whichthey can associate with each other. It is also easier in such a prison to providesecurity against escapes. It is simpler to organise and control the hand-sewing ofmailbags than the modern types of industrial work now being introduced. Asthe diversity of skills and experience to be found among the staff of a prisonbecomes greater and more staff of all grades are involved in the treatment of offenders, so it becomes more difficult to ensure that their work serves a set ofconsistent aims.

It showsthat the increases which have taken place in the average length of prison sentenceare largely accounted for by the fact that a smaller number of people are nowsent to prison for very short periods.THE SIZE OF THE SERVICE23. There are now about 35,000 people in custody compared with about 20,000in 1950. About 9,000 of them are sleeping two or three in a cell compared with ,000 in 1950. During the same period the total number of staff employed inthe prison service has increased from 5,500 to 15,000 and the total annual expenditure, capital as well as current, from under  6 million to about  50million a year. The Prison Department is now responsible for 111 institutionscompared with 57 in 1950.THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TASK24. The work of the prison service is inherently complex because a prison mustbe, in most respects, a micro-copy of the world outside. People live, eat, work andsleep in prison. There must be hospitals, chapels, classrooms and workshopswithin the perimeter of the prison, as within the confines of other &quot;total&quot;institutions. There is the further responsibility for security. &quot;Rehabilitation&quot;itself is complex. There is no such person as the average offender. How should there be when all human beings are different? All generalisations about the characteristics of people in custody are therefore suspect. (There are exceptionseven to the generalisation that people in custody are there unwillingly). the prison service has to deal with offenders, some of whom are dangerous andmany of whom are afflicted by emotional and personality disturbance and social inadequacies. It is also true that the prison service has to cope with manywith whom other social agencies have in some way failed.25. These inherent complexities are not new, although we are becoming increasingly conscious of the task of rehabilitation in relation to them. There isnow a wide variety of penal institutions: remand centres, detention centres,borstals and prisons for those under 21 and both open and closed prisons for those over 21. Increasingly, moreover, the service aims to provide a range ofregimes even within one type of institution and has to assess the suitability of offenders for transfer from one to another. Obviously it is simpler to organise a prison in which the inmates are held in solitary confinement than one in whichthey can associate with each other. It is also easier in such a prison to providesecurity against escapes. It is simpler to organise and control the hand-sewing ofmailbags than the modern types of industrial work now being introduced. Asthe diversity of skills and experience to be found among the staff of a prisonbecomes greater and more staff of all grades are involved in the treatment of offenders, so it becomes more difficult to ensure that their work serves a set ofconsistent aims.
NOTE TO PART IICHANGES IN PRISON population and LENGTH OF SENTENCEi. The number of offenders in custody at any one time depends on severalfactors: the number convicted by the courts, the number committed to custodyand the length of sentence imposed. The work of the prison service is thereforecrucially affected not only by the total rise in the number of offenders but by changes in the sentencing practice of the courts. This note analyses the effect ofsome of those changes in the last few years. Also, because the information is notwidely known or readily available, the note makes some comparisons betweenthe post war position and that in 1913 and 1938.ii. Table 1 shows how many people were committed to custody in selected years from 1913 onwards. Table 2 shows how many people, on an average day, were in custody in the same years.TABLE 1People Committed to Custody (Males and Females)	1913	1938	1948	1958	1961	1964	1967	1968Remands etc.*	15,402	9,506	11,667	18,059	18,682	22,591	29,394	30,864Detention Centre	 	 	 .	1,302	2,311	5,890	7,220	7,675Borstal	487	1,347	2,115	3,162	3,715	3,863	5,160	5,153Sentenced to								imprisonment!&apos;	138,570	30,772	35,277	34,239	40,581	44,013	48,333	36,069Civil prisoners								and others	14,987	8,246	5,372	9,377	9,676	9,633	8,011	7,505Total	169,446	49,871	54,431	66,139	74,965	85,990	98,118	87,266*Persons remanded or committed in custody who did not return to custody on sentence,tlmprisonment includes court martial sentences, life sentences and death sentences commutedto life imprisonment.

Fewer people now go to prison for a short period.

Table 4 combines the information about offenders sent to prison and aboutthe total prison population with an index of the average length of sentence. it shows how these factors have varied in relation to each other over the years. two points need to be emphasised here, in drawing any conclusions about greaterseverity or greater leniency on the part of the courts. The first, which is perhapsobvious, is that as we achieve the very desirable aim of not sending people to prison for a few weeks when there are other ways of dealing with them, so theaverage length of sentence is bound to increase. Second, the figures given arethose for all offenders, including those under 21, sentenced to imprisonment.Statutory restrictions on the powers of the court to send young offenders to prison and the greater use of borstal and detention centres are likely to affect theaverage length of prison sentences.TABLE 4Sentenced PrisonersComparisons of Receptions, Population and A verage Length* of Sentence(Males and Females)1	2	3*	4	5*	6*			Average		Index of	Receptions		Population		Average	under\	Index of	of sentenced	Index of	length of	sentence	receptions	prisoners	population	sentence1913	138,295	342-0	Not available	 	17 01938	30,646	75-8	7,674	36-8	38-91948	34,687	85-8	14,665	70-3	82-71958	34,009	84-1	17,817	85-4	98-81961	40,440	100-0	20,845	100-0	100-01964	43,977	108-7	20,759	99-5	84-41967	48,234	119-3	23,782	114-0	93-41968	36,020	89-1	21,401	102-7	119-3&quot;Columns 3, 5 and 6 are indices with 1961			taken as 100.		fExcluding Court Martial cases, but including persons sentenced to life imprisonment except where sentences of death were later commuted.
v. Table 3 showed the number of offenders received into prison in certain yearswho had received sentences of particular lengths. Table 5 analyses the same set of figures so as to show what percentage of those sentenced to imprisonment in thesame years received sentences of particular lengths. (In both tables offenderscommitted to custody in default of payment of fines are treated as though theyhad been sentenced to imprisonment). It shows that the proportion of offendersreceived into prison with sentences of more than 5 years is greater now than before the war or in 1948.TABLE 5Analysis of Length of Prison Sentence expressed as percentages*(Males and Females)	1913	1938	1948	1958	1961	1964		1967	1968Up to 2 weeks	58-6	28-7	100	8-9	7-6	7	-2	5-1	8-1Over 2 weeks up to									5 weeks	21-9	24-4	16-7	14-5	14-2	16	-0	14-6	10-5Over 5 weeks up to									3 months	12-2	23-0	24-7	24-7	25-2	27	-3	28-3	19-2Over 3 months up to									6 months	3-7	12-9	18-3	19-7	20-4	23	-5	23-8	21-6Over 6 months up to									12 months	2-1	61	14-3	14-2	14-7	11-	7	11-8	16-2Over 12 months up									to 18 months	0-7	2-3	7-1	6-3	6-1	5-	1	5-9	8-8Over 18 months up									to 3 years	0-5	1-9	7-4	8-5	8-6	7-	1	7-6	11-3Over 3 years up to 5									years	0-2	0-5	1-0	2-1	2-1	1-	6	2-0	3-0Over 5 years	0-1	0-2	0-4	1-0	1-0	0&apos;	5	0-7	1-0Life	 	 	0-1	0-1	0-1	0-	1	0-2	0-3&quot;Including periods imposed in cases of fine default.Excluding court martial prisoners.Criminal Justice Act 1967vi. It has been the policy of successive Governments throughout this century toattempt to limit the number of people sent to custody and to encourage othereffective ways of dealing with offenders. In particular there has been a series of statues aimed at reducing to the minimum the number of young people and first offenders sent to prison. One of the main purposes of the Criminal JusticeAct 1967 was to accelerate the shift of emphasis away from imprisonment. Onemajor innovation introduced by that Act was the suspended sentence, enabling the courts when passing a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years or less to suspendits operation for a period of between one and 3 years. In any case where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months or less (as were over 60 percent of those sent to prison in 1967) the court is obliged to suspend the sentenceunless the offence is one involving violence or a weapon, or the offender has previously received a prison or borstal sentence (including a suspended sentence)or is subject to a probation order or an order of conditional discharge. the offender serves his sentence only if, within the period of suspension, he commitsa further offence punishable with imprisonment; in that event, the suspendedsentence is put into effect unless the court considers that it would be unjust to doso in view of any circumstances that have arisen since it was passed.
vii. It is too early to pass any judgment on the effect of the new provisions in keeping people out of prison and deterring them from committing fresh offences.It is not simply a question of counting the number of suspended sentences passedand the number subsequently enforced after fresh crimes have been committed,since the figures suggest that some courts may have passed a suspended sentencewhere before 1968 they would have imposed a fine. Nevertheless the first year&apos;s figures are encouraging. In 1968 32,002 offenders received suspended sentencesand within that year only 4,222 were committed to prison after a subsequentconviction.viii. The 1967 Act contained other measures designed to reduce the number of people sent to prison for short periods. These included legislative restrictions onremands in custody, the freer use of bail, the more widespread use of socialinquiry reports as a guide to sentencing, increased powers to fine offenders, andmodified fine-enforcement procedures. Here also the preliminary results are-encouraging. The number of people received into custody before sentence andthis, for almost all adults, means detention in grossly overcrowded local prisons -fell by 1,564 (or 3 per cent) in 1968 compared with 1967 and the number ofthose sent to prison in default of fines fell by 4,395 or 34 per cent.Lengtli of Prison Sentences in Recent Yearsix. Paragraphs iv and v show that fewer people are being sent to prison for short periods than before the war and that the average length of sentence hasincreased. Table 6 gives more detailed information about the average length of sentence in each year since 1961. It shows that this fell between 1961 and 1963,and has increased, again since 1966. The sharp increase in 1968 is a reflection ofthe fall in the number of offenders received, into prison on short sentence as aresult of the Criminal Justice Act 1967. it is too early to say what the long termtrend will be.TABLE 6Comparison of Receptions, Population and Average Length&quot; of Sentence in recent years(Males and Females)1	2	3*	4	5*	6*	Receptions tinder^ sentence	Index o receptions	A verage Population of sentenced Prisoners	Index of Population	Index of A verage length of sentence1961	40,440	100 0	20,845	100-0	100-01962	45,868	113-4	22,282	106-8	91-61963	45,939	113-6	21,890	105-0	84-31964	43,977	108-7	20,759	99-5	84-41965	45,440	112-4	20,681	99-2	83-61966	50,032	123-7	22,316	107-0	93-91967	48,234	119-3	23,782	114-0	93-41968	36,020	89-1	21,401	102-7	119-3*Columns 3, 5 and 6 are indices with 1961 taken as 100.1&apos;Excluding Court Martial cases, but including persons sentenced to life imprisonment except where sentences of death were later commuted.
Very Long Sentencesx. There is a widespread impression that more very long sentences are nowbeing imposed. Table 7 gives some information about the number of offenderssentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or over (including life) in each year since1958. It shows that while there has been an increase in the number of offendersreceived with life sentences, the number of fixed sentences of 10 years and overhas not changed greatly in the last decade. On the other hand, there has been achange in the number of offenders received with fixed sentences of 14 years andover. Table 8 shows the number of such sentences imposed in each year since1949. As the Advisory Council on the Penal System pointed out in their Reporton the Regime for Long-Term Maximum Security Prisoners*, the secure yethumane containment of this very small group of prisoners creates special problems for the prison service.*Thc Regime for Long-Term Prisoners in conditions of Maximum Security. H.M.S.O. 1968.

New problems have also been created for the prison service by the increasein the number of prisoners serving life sentences. 10 years ago, at the end of 1958,there were 139 prisoners serving life sentences or detention &quot;during Her Majesty&apos;pleasure&quot;. 5 years later the figure was 329. By 31st December 1968 it had risen to
598. It seems likely that the number will continue to rise. The term of imprison-ment actually served by prisoners sentenced for life is determined according tothe circumstances of every particular case and every case is different. Since thewar most life sentence prisoners have served a term equal to that served by a prisoner with a long fixed sentence of between 10 and 18 years. Out of 180 suchprisoners released in the 10 years 1959-1969 all but 19 had served for periodsequivalent to a fixed sentence of 10^ years or longer on which the normal onethird remission had been granted. A few life sentence prisoners were detained, for much longer periods. One had spent 15 years in prison, one 20, and two were released after 21 years. Such very long periods have been unusual since the war.But the position is changing partly as a result of the abolition of capital punish-ment. There are some men who have already spent a considerable period in custody (in one case more than twenty years) and whom it would not in thepresent state of knowledge be safe to release into the community. A few mayhave to be detained for something approaching the term of their natural life.
IllOFFENDERS IN CUSTODYTHE PEOPLE IN CUSTODY26. This and the next Part of the White Paper deal with the treatment of people in custody, with their daily lives and with what is done to conduce to theirrehabilitation as members of the community. It will be useful, first, to describe the people in custody, and, second, to clarify what is meant by &quot;treatment&quot;.27. The Appendix (page 000) shows their ages, the offences of which they havebeen convicted, and how many times they have been in custody before. In 1968there were on average over 31,500 men and boys but only 800 women and girlsin custody: a ratio of about 40 to 1. The following table shows the main groups:	Male	Female1. In prison		(a) unsentenced	3,474	182(b) sentenced to imprisonment up to 18		months	9,628	275(c) sentenced to  imprisonment over 18		months	11,351	1472. Sentenced to Borstal	5,648	1783. At a detention centre	1,555	23Total       ......	31,656	805UNSENTENCED PRISONERS28. About 10 per cent of all those in custody are being held on remand orawaiting sentence. They are detained in local prisons or special remand centres,and Part VI of the White Paper gives some account of the staff time occupied inlooking after them and the related escort duties and court work.SENTENCED PRISONERS29. The people in custody are predominantly young. About 28 per cent of all those in custody are under 21, while of the men over that age, almost half are under 30. The figures given in the Appendix show that the majority of convictedoffenders have been found guilty of offences against property (theft or burglary)and that only a very small proportion are first offenders -less than one in ten of adult men sent to prison, and less than one in thirty of young men at borstal.
Moreover, and this is equally important to any assessment of the task of theservice, the majority of convicted offenders in prisons and borstals are not servingtheir first sentence but have been in custody before.LENGTH OF SENTENCE30. The majority of convicted offenders are in custody for less than twelvemonths. Young offenders sent to detention centres normally serve a fixedsentence of three or six months, on which one-third remission is now granted;and the normal period of detention at borstal is a little over a year. Only about one in five of adult offenders in prison have to spend more than two years in custody *.TREATMENT31. No clear distinction can, or should, be drawn between the aspects of trcat-ment that are primarily designed to regulate the daily life of an offender in custody and those that look primarily towards his return to the community.For example, a man&apos;s attitude to authority after release may well be affected bythe conduct of a disciplinary hearing in prison. The clothes that a young man atborstal has to wear may affect his self-respect and thus his view of himself andof society. Again, work is central to the treatment of many offenders in custody.Well organised and productive work can provide training that is of value to anoffender after release. In addition, the organisation and. tempo of work in a prison or borstal affect the attitude of the offender to his daily life and the atmosphere of the institution in which he is detained.32. Thus it is wrong to think of treatment as an item, or choice of items, that can be added at will to the daily regime of a prison or borstal to meet the needsof offenders. Neither our capacity for the diagnosis of the needs of offenders northe ability to effect a cure is at present as great as many advocates of this or thatform of treatment have implied. We need a view of treatment that embraces allthat is done by or for the offender in custody. But there is also a place in the prison system for the use of the term in the alternative sense in which it relates toa diagnosis and to the possibility of a changed way of life; and there are already in the system a wide variety of forms of treatment that have been evolved in thehope that they may directly affect an offenders behaviour both in custody andafter release and may assist his rehabilitation.DAILY ROUTINE33. It is not possible within a brief compass to describe all aspects of the treat-ment of offenders in custody in the wide variety of establishments for which the prison Department is reponsible. The following paragraphs describe some of themain aspects of the daily routine of a prison or borstal. Here, and elsewhere inthe White Paper, most of what is said of prisons and borstals applies also todetention centres and remand centres.The note on page ^ refers to the special problems created for the prison service by the small number of men serving very long sentences.
A SOCIETY IN MINIATURE34. In many ways a prison or borstal is a society in miniature providing for those in custody most of the essential facilities of living that the citizen enjoysoutside. The original basic elements of the well-ordered Victorian gaol werefood, shelter, clothing, exercise (of a sort), religious services and medical treat-ment. &quot;Good order and discipline&quot; were maintained by the separation ofprisoners and the enforcement of the rule of silence. Mere incarceration was not thought punishment enough. As Wilde wrote in his Ballad of Reading Gaol:&quot;/ know not whether laws be rightOr whether laws be wrong;All that we know who lie in gaolIs that the wall is strong,And that each day is like a year,A year whose days are long.&quot;But now to the original basic elements are added work, access to books, oppor-tunities for education, and opportunities for social life and recreation within theinstitution. As a result the prison society has become increasingly complex.DISCIPLINE35. The entire regime must rest on a foundation of discipline and good order.As with all societies a prison or borstal must have rules, and sanctions that canbe imposed for breaches of them. But discipline depends far more on the atti-altitudes of staff and of the offenders in their charge than it does upon sanctions.The relationships in the daily contacts between members of the prison serviceand offenders in custody are generally good. (A visitor whose image of a prisonhas been formed by the harshness of its Victorian buildings, and by grim talesof prison life, is very often surprised by the relaxed atmosphere he finds inside the wall.) In the last few years the uniformed officer has been encouraged to get to know and to concern himself with the treatment of those in custody, with theresult that there has been a noticeable improvement in the atmosphere of ourinstitutions. This process will continue. There will always be a small minority of offenders needing strict control and supervision and there are some offenderswho, if given any opportunity to do so, will dominate the larger group of whichthey form a small part. For the majority of offenders no more restrictions need be imposed than are necessitated by the efficient performance of the task of theestablishment within the limited space available, and by the maintenance ofgood order.ASSOCIATION36. The Gladstone Committee recommended in 1895 that &quot;the privilege oftalking might be given after a certain period as a reward for good conduct on certain days for a limited time&quot;*. The difference between this cautious recom-mendation and the present practice is one illustration of the change in the atti-tude of our prison system to the social life of people in custody. Restrictions on*Paragraph 73 of the Report.
prisoners talking to each other have long since been abolished, and it is theGovernment^ policy to allow them to associate with each other at work, atmealtimes and in the evenings. The fact that in our local prisons too many arelocked in their cells for up to 18 hours out of the 24, and sometimes longer atthe weekends, shows the extent to which progress is still hampered by Victorianbuildings, designed for solitary confinement, and by shortages of staff. In many local prisons most prisoners have to eat in their cells, because there is no room for them to do so anywhere else, and spend the evening hours in their cellsbecause of the lack of space for classes or other activities. (An evening, in prison,starts at 5 p.m.) At the other end of the spectrum is the purpose-built trainingprison in which prisoners eat their meals together, and in which rooms are avail-able where, in the evening, they can watch television, play table tennis orbilliards, or talk. Between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. in these prisons a man does nothave to be locked in his cell except for very brief periods. In this respect, the establishments for young offenders are at the same end of the spectrum as thetraining prison. The staff complement of all borstals and detention centres is designed to allow a full day&apos;s activities, including work, opportunity for sportand recreation, and evening association.OTHER PRIVILEGES37. The reference in the quotation from the Gladstone Committee Report tothe grant of &quot;the privilege of talking ... as a reward for good conduct&quot; illus-trates two other points. First, the way in which the privileges of one generationbecome the accepted practice of the next library books, for example, are nolonger a privilege to be allowed only to some people; and, secondly, the use of privileges as rewards for good conduct. There is certainly a place for the pro-gressive grant of privileges if they entail greater responsibilities on the part ofthe inmate, and mark real progress in his response to training. This is still oneof the main features of the borstal system. But any graded system of privilegesis liable to become automatic and bureaucratic. The Government decided in1967 to abolish the gradation of minor privileges in prisons and those parts ofthe old &quot;stage&quot; system that still remained, and changed the emphasis by retain-ing and strengthening the power of the Governor to withdraw privileges, suchas that of eating meals in association, from the minority who abuse them. Onesuch development was that prisoners in cellular training prisons may now havepersonal radio sets.THE PRISON COMMUNITY38. There are dangerous and violent people in custody; but, although themaintenance of good order and discipline is the first duty of any penal adminis-tration, the staff are not merely detached preservers of good order. Their role ismore complicated and more important than that. To understand their role it isfirst necessary to abandon the presumption, frequently and naively made, thatthe prisoner is the passive recipient of punishment or of instruction, or that he isthe unprotesting object of institutional control.39. Offenders see committal to custody as a mark of society&apos;s rejection. while some are genuinely filled with regret for their offences they do not necessarily
accept that their sentences are just. Moreover, life in custody, with its inevitablereduction of personal choice in companions, possessions, and activities, may beseen by the offender as a threat to his own sense of identity. He may seek to counter this threat by his own individual response to the regime or by sharingin the collective attitudes of those around him. Acts of indiscipline and dis-obedience are the overt expressions of such protest. Manipulation of &quot;thesystem&quot;, of the procedure for redress of genuine grievances, of staff and of otherinmates, are less obvious but not less serious manifestations of the attitudes of offenders to the reality of custody, and can lead to the undermining of authority or to a situation in which a great deal of the work of the staff is taken up with itsmaintenance.THE ROLE OF THE STAFF40. Most observers of the prison community would accept this generalanalysis, although there would be dispute about the details. Many offenders seemembers of the staff of the prison or borstal as part of a hostile community. It istherefore of vital importance to find means, particularly through staff training,to avoid such a general polarisation of attitudes. For if someone in custody isable to make a personal contact with a member of the staff he may begin to appreciate that the staff are fellow human beings, who have many other functionsthan that of representing the restrictive aspects of authority. Such appreciationmay enable him to reject the pressures for a collective and unreasoning hostility to the staff, and encourage him to think about his own present behaviour andthat which brought him into custody. When an offender begins to understand the reasons for his own behaviour there is a much better chance of his being able to change it in future.PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS41. There are many opportunities for offenders to develop personal relation-ships of varying kinds with members of the staff within the prison society: withofficers in the daily activities of the prison, in personal interviews and recreation,with instructors in workshops and teachers in classes, with chaplains and welfare officers, with assistant governors and governors. All these situations provide thestaff with opportunities that can be used to demonstrate that good relationshipsare possible; and if the staff have received training in the skills of individual casework and in the understanding of group processes, such personal influence islikely to be the more effective.A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE COMMUNITY42. Individual case work of this nature may take place within the prisoncommunity as it exists. Or there may be a conscious attempt to alter the structure of that community in such a way that the offenders in it can help others and themselves to deal in a positive way with their destructive tendencies. Anyattempt to change the attitudes of offenders by these methods requires training and understanding on the part of the staff, and makes heavy demands on them.43. The prison service is engaged in an attempt to develop a constructivecommunity atmosphere at Grendon, under psychiatric supervision. Other prisons
and borstals have experimented in the conscious shaping of a regime and of staffattitudes to this end. For example, group counselling has been found a usefulway of helping some young men in borstals to face up to their difficulties and tounderstand more easily the reasons for behaviour which is not acceptable tosociety. It is hoped that research, particularly in certain borstals, may in timeshow what types of offenders are receptive to individual treatment, to treatment in groups, and to the more traditional forms of training, for it is very likely that group treatment will not be beneficial for all.44. The efficacy of such concepts in reducing criminality is as yet unproven.What does seem clear is that staff involvement with offenders, and greaterunderstanding of the nature of custody, have brought about an encouragingalteration in the social climate of many institutions, a lessening of tension and areduction of violent outbursts by prisoners. The alteration in atmosphere has brought benefits as well as challenges to staff no less than to offenders.WORK45. In no part of the prison system have there been greater changes in the past few years than in the sphere of work. The policy that work for prisoners shouldbe punitive, and therefore as purposeless and degrading as possible, was aban-abandoned long ago, and the belief that the offender, especially the young offender,might be reclaimed by being taught a trade lay behind much of the penal reform in the period before 1914. It was in 1914 that that shrewd observer Kin Hubbardwrote of a man that &quot;he has decided to go to work until he can find somethingbetter&quot;. Between the wars, considerable attempts were made to improve workand industrial training, but the economic climate was not favourable. After thesecond world war economic conditions had altered and more and better work was available to prison workshops. But these opportunities came at a time whenthe number of offenders in custody was increasing rapidly, and as both the opportunities and problems grew it became clear that the prison service lackedthe organisation to implement new policies efficiently.PURPOSE OF WORK46. In 1960 an Advisory Council on the Employment of Prisoners was set upto advise the Government of the day how things might be improved. In threereports the Council defined the purpose of work for offenders, suggested the kinds of employment that were suitable and set out the changes in organisation that they thought were necessary. Real progress is now being made on the basisof the Council&apos;s recommendations. Current developments have two aims. Thefirst, and more important, is that offenders in custody shall be given training and experience that will fit them to get and keep jobs on discharge. The second isthat the best possible economic use be made of prison labour. For the most partthese two aims can go hand in hand. Modern semi-skilled work the kind ofproduction work done in the bulk of the industries of the country is what isreadily available to most offenders on discharge. It is also the kind of work that can be organised in prisons and borstals so as to make a useful contribution tothe national economy. The Government recognises that it is right to provide
facilities for the comparatively small proportion of offenders who are capableof learning and benefiting from a skilled trade, and more also needs to be done for the comparatively small proportion who can realistically hope to return to&quot;white collar&quot; employment. It is, however, neither practicable nor indeednecessary to provide for most offenders exactly the same work in custody asthey might obtain after release. The need is the inculcation of the habit of regular and purposeful work at a tempo and in conditions as close as possibleto those of outside industry.PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES47. In developing this kind of work the Prison Department faces practicaldifficulties that are not met by outside employers who can choose whom theywill employ. Some prisoners are not inclined to work and others lack the adapt-ability to take on even fairly routine jobs. A small proportion would probablybe regarded by any outside employer as unemployable. Some, like Mark Twain,&quot;dislike work even when another person does it&quot;. There is about a 400 per centturnover each year in the labour force of the average prison workshop. This is partly because of the number of offenders serving short sentences and partly because of the transfers that are necessary from one establishment, or part of an establishment, to another. It is a situation that might face a business with over100 branches each of which changed its labour force every three months. Alsomost prisons were built at a time when the policy regarding prison work was quite different, and the demand for workshop space far smaller. Existing builcl-ings cannot easily be adapted to house modern manufacturing processes; inmany cases there is neither enough space nor enough power.48. There is, however, an obligation to provide some sort of work for everyonein custody. In overcrowded prisons this means the overmanning of workshop and the absorption of further surplus labour into the domestic services of the prison. Security, which can never be ignored, affects the layout of workshops;and in closed prisons it involves arrangements for escorting prisoners to andfrom work that cut into normal working hours. In local prisons in particularthere are many other claims on staff time that may have to take priority overthe manning of workshops.49. In the past few years considerable resources have gone to help to overcome the physical handicaps. New workshops have been built, power supplies havebeen improved and about  750,000 invested in machinery in the last four years.But this has still not caught up with the deficiencies of the past. A long period ofsustained building and equipping of workshops lies ahead.THE ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT OF WORK50. The pace at which buildings, services and equipment can be modernised isnot the only factor governing the effectiveness and economics of work. Thereports of the Advisory Council on the Employment of Prisoners laid stress onthe need for better organisation and management. In 1964 the legacy from thepast was a collection of 36 manufacturing activities spread over a hundred andmore establishments. Three years ago a start was made in reducing this complex
of activities to a small number of industries that could be organised on a sound economic basis and that would still provide a wide range of semi-skilled work.The industries chosen were light engineering, carpentry, garment making, metalrecovery, weaving and laundering. Under present plans most prisons will eventually have no more than two main industrial activities.51. This smaller number of industries requires efficient management. TheAdvisory Council pointed the need for the same calibre of management as wouldbe found in an efficient firm. Acceptance of their recommendations has called for a reorganisation of the whole management structure of prison industries.The new management of prison industry cannot be based entirely on outsidepatterns. It operates in, and must understand, the special constraints of the prison situation in which profitability is not the overriding consideration. Itmust also operate in the framework of annual estimates, and the careful checkand control of public money, that stem from accountability to Ministers and toParliament and do not always allow of commercial flexibility. Nevertheless, the prison Department has looked to outside industry for staff and for ideas. It hasintroduced modern techniques such as work study, management accounting,marketing, quality control and management development of staff, that arc anaccepted feature of modern industry but were new to prison industries. All thishas required an increase in the number of civil servants employed in what hasbeen an under-managed area; and. more staff, especially senior managementstaff, will be needed in the next few years to complete the process of modcrnisa-tion.
VALUE OF PRODUCTION m11 T-1-1-1-T 1 PRISON INDUSTRIES:1962 &apos;64    &apos;66    &apos;68    &apos;70    &apos;72FINANCIAL RETURNS52. The financial returns from prison industries as a whole have shown encouragement-aging improvement. The value of production is rising. The graph on this pageshows the estimated value of production in each year since 1962 and the increaseplanned up to 1972. The trading results are also improving. Against the value ofgoods produced by prison industries must be set the costs incurred in their pro-duction. These include the normal industrial costs of materials and overheads(including rent). They also include the cost of supervision in prison workshops.The diagram above puts the value of production and costs together to show the trading results for 1962, 64, 66 and 68 and the projected outcome in 1970 and1972.MAKING A PROFIT53. In the past, prison industries always made a loss. It reached about  750,000in 1966, and had been reduced to  450,000 in 1968. The current loss is about 350,000 a year. The Governmenfs immediate aim is to turn the loss into a profit of  500,000 by 1972. Profit depends on productivity. The annual value ofgoods produced by the average prisoner in prison industries today is about 420. The comparable figure for an operative in outside industry is about

 2,500, and the gap between the two shows the theoretical scope for improvingproductivity in prison workshops. The unique handicaps faced by prison indus-tries will always put the national figure beyond reach, but by 1973 about 16,000operatives (an increase of 23 per cent over the present number) should be pro-ducing per head goods to the value of  700 per year, and, as a long-term aim, a figure approaching  2,000 per head might be a realistic target. Productivity ofthis order would show a substantial profit.OCCUPATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL WORKSHOPS54. It is only in a proportion, though an increasing proportion, of prisonworkshops that work can be efficiently organised. There are some old and over-crowded workshops known as &quot;occupational shops&quot; where ,because of the size and quality of the labour force, &quot;employment&quot; is little more than a way of spending part of the day. These differences are reflected in the costs incurred.As the diagram on page 000 shows, the cost of supervision and overheads isproportionately higher in occupational shops, which accordingly make a loss.The remaining shops, the &quot;industrial shops&quot;, are now breaking even.MARKETS55. As production expands so prison industries require bigger markets. Themain markets will probably involve the production of goods and services forgovernment departments (including the Prison Department). But production forsale to commercial firms and nationalised industries will increase. To someextent, since prison industries see their future in association with outside indus-try, this will be through sub-contracting arrangements with firms. To a lesser extent, it will be through competition on fair terms. It is important for prisonindustries to have the understanding and co-operation of both sides of outsideindustry. This has lately been forthcoming, and the Government is grateful for itand will do all it can to preserve this goodwill.COLDINGLEY56. At a new prison at Coldingley in Surrey many developments described in previous paragraphs are being taken a stage further. The regime of this newprison is geared to industry, and prisoners work in light engineering, or in thecommercial laundry, with equipment and in conditions comparable with thosefound in efficient organisations outside. This project is designed to be an econ-omic success. Its industries, employing 240 prisoners, should have an annualturnover of  400,000. More important, Coldingley will test the possibility of&quot;training the whole man&quot; in an industrial prison environment with a regime towhich all the other interests in the prison service can also make a contribution.NON-INDUSTRIAL WORK57. 80 per cent of the population at Coldingley will be employed on industrialwork. In prisons as a whole only about half the population is so employed. too many prisoners are at present under-employed in the domestic services of the prison, such as cleaning, and in the kitchens. There is room for much improve-
ment in the efficiency of domestic services and a start has been made by applyingwork measurement to such services and setting standards of efficient manning of parties. Several thousand more jobs will have to be provided in industry and building to absorb the prisoners released from domestic work.FARMING58. There is scope for similar improvement in fanning. The Prison Departmentowns or rents about 11,000 acres of farm land. This employs an average of 1,200people and produces about  600,000 worth of food a year. The yield from thesefarms is above the national average, but the use of labour is uneconomic, andthere have been unrealistic assumptions about the training value of work on farms for men and boys likely to return to urban areas. There is scope, however,for a rationalised modern farm system giving efficient work to a relatively small number of offenders and making a contribution to the national economy. Someof the more isolated farms manned by parties of prisoners travelling daily froma parent prison might be capable of being developed as separate residentialestablishments. A study is being made of the feasibility of this and of the regimesthat might be suitable. One suggestion is that they might be used as an experi-mental form of treatment for some categories of socially inadequate offenders.ORGANISED WORK OUTSIDE59. Some open prisons and borstals supply parties to work for farmers in theneighbourhood, particularly at harvest time. Other parties help to improve localamenities, such as canals, and take part in archaeological excavations. While theGovernment is in sympathy with the employment of offenders on outside work that has clear social value, the contribution prison labour can make in thisdirection is limited by security considerations, shortage of supervisory staff andthe need to devote resources to improving work within institutions.BUILDING WORK60. There is wide scope for increasing the amount of building work done byoffenders. There is nothing new in prisoners producing work that benefits the prison system and the Government does not accept that it is wrong so to employthem. Their labour can make an important contribution not only to the badly needed maintenance and rebuilding of some of the older prisons and borstals,but to the building of new establishments. The building of the detention centre at Eastwood Park, in Gloucestershire, was an example of what can be done.Almost the whole of the work was done by prisoners who were brought to the site daily from Leyhill and Bristol prisons. The buildings cost 25 per cent less(that is about  100,000) than they would have done had the work been done by outside contract. The prisoners benefited because their work had obviouspurpose and value, and was done in conditions, and at a tempo, comparable to that of a sizeable building project. Both prisoners and staff benefited from theharmonious working relationships that grew up on the site.61. The success of this project has encouraged the Prison Department to extendplans for the efficient use of its own labour force, for example in the rebuilding
of major parts of the borstal at Holleslcy Bay, Suffolk, and of the prison at TheVerne, Dorset, and in other long-term redevelopment plans*. These projectshave shown the value of the right kind of training. The emphasis in trades otherthan building is changing to provide practical training that the prisoner can put to profitable use during his sentence as well as in employment after his discharge.CO-OPERATION IN RESETTLEMENT62. An important feature of the Eastwood Park scheme described above wasthe part played by the local officers of the building trade unions. They took an interest in the prisoners&apos; work. Before the end of a prisoners sentence they inter-viewed him and in suitable cases arranged his admission to a union and helpedhim to settle in the building trade on his discharge. The Amalgamated Union ofBuilding Trade Workers has agreed to national arrangements of this kind. the prison Department has made similar arrangements with the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union and hopes to do so shortly with other unions; it is alsoseeking further co-operation from employers who might help in the resettlement of offenders on release. It is felt that young offenders in borstal can, for example,benefit considerably from an increase in building work, the practical trainingallied to it, and arrangements with trade unions to help in resettlement in theworking community. In the engineering industry, co-operation with an outsidefirm has produced schemes under which prisoners arc given production trainingon up-to-date engineering machines supplied by the firm and arc able to apply for jobs in the firm&apos;s factories on discharge. These arrangements also have beenmade with the support of the trade unions.EARNINGS63. The average earnings of offenders in custody at present arc 7s. a week.This is no more than pocket money. It allows no scope for savings to be madefor the offenders discharge, or to help his family. As an incentive to hard work it is derisory. The Government believes that the improvement in the tempo ofwork, and the increasing opportunities to do a useful and productive job, canthemselves have an important effect on the rehabilitation of offenders and thedevelopment of prison industries. But there must also be an improvement in earnings, and that must come from greater opportunity for employment in moreskilful work. This approach makes sense in economic terms, and in terms of thegeneral treatment of offenders. It is Government policy therefore to tie higherearnings to improved standards of work. New rates have been introduced andsome prisoners will be able to earn up to 33s. a week in return for increases in productivity.INCENTIVE SCHEMES64. The new incentive schemes started in 1967 in the workshops at Kirkhamprison in Lancashire and in selected workshops at other prisons. The prisonersemployed on the building of the detention centre at Eastwood Park receivedincentive payments. The results were encouraging. A further experiment at*See paragraph 186.
Kirkham has shown that similar incentive schemes can be applied to other types of work and can produce an increase in productivity approaching 40 per cent.They also bring a much brisker atmosphere to the whole prison. The Govcrn-ment plans the extension of incentive schemes. Their introduction depends onthe careful application of work measurement techniques by skilled staff and onthe provision of more jobs to absorb the prisoners made redundant by moreefficiently organised work. Progress is therefore steady rather than spectacular.1,000 prisoners are now being paid on an incentive basis. By the end of this year there should be at least 2,000. An experimental scheme has started, at one borstal.FUTURE PLANS65. It is often suggested that offenders in custody should, receive earningscomparable with those of average workers in outside industry and. that fromthese earnings they should meet their commitments to their families, and the costof their board and lodging, now borne by the taxpayer. The Government regardsarrangements of this kind as its ultimate aim. But prison industries are clearly avery long way from being able to meet on an economic basis the  30 millions ormore a year that it would cost to pay everyone now in custody the national average wage.66. There arc two possible policies that could be followed in the next few years.The general level of earnings of all prisoners could be gradually increased as theefficiency and profitability of prison industry improves, or increased, earningscould be confined to those prisoners whose work became more efficient andprofitable than the average: there are already some workshops which couldsupport pay of several pounds a week to those working in them. These twopolicies arc not mutually exclusive, and. whatever increase becomes possible inthe general level of earnings the Government hopes that individual prisoners willcontinue to be able to earn more than the average by their own efforts.FOOD AND CLOTHING67. Reference was made earlier to the basic elements of the prison regime.These include food and clothing. Prison food, is wholesome and. adequate. Inthe past the chief criticism has been that it was monotonous and badly served.Much has been done since the war to improve the preparation and serving offood, and, where space has been available, to improve messing facilities. fndi-vidual establishments are able to introduce more variety into their menus. Thegeneral standard, of prison catering now compares favourably with that in hospitals and other institutions. As in any other institution the quality of themeals depends largely on the efforts and imagination of the person in charge ofcatering, and the general improvement of recent years owes a good, deal to thework of the catering officers of the service.68. Prison clothing has also been much criticised, and although many of the critics have underestimated, the practical problems of providing serviceableclothing for a rapidly changing population, the Government agrees that there isconsiderable scope for improvement. Most women and girls in custody are now
allowed to wear their own clothing or civilian clothing bought for them. Thishas improved their morale and their self respect. The problems of security and discipline are different for men and boys in custody and the Government has noplans for allowing convicted offenders in male establishments to wear their ownclothes. The aim rather is to encourage self-respect by improving standards ofuniform clothing.69. The battledress blouse has been the outward mark of an offender in custodyfor many years. It is neither smart in appearance nor particularly serviceable.It is now being replaced by a jacket that is more attractive and more comfortableto wear. Shirts, socks and underwear of a more modern design have also been introduced. The redesigned garments require fewer manufacturing operations in prison workshops and are cheaper to produce, and it has been possible toimprove the frequency of issue, which is particularly important for underwear.It should soon be possible to introduce, without increase of cost, more varietyinto the clothing provided, and to allow most men and boys in custody somechoice of what they will wear. It should, for example, be possible to have a range of shirts in different colours. Pyjamas are now being issued in prisons as well asin borstals (the latter have had them for some years); among the inheritedVictorian traditions was one that required prisoners to sleep in their shirts.MEDICAL SERVICES70. Because of the National Health Service and changing social conditions thepeople who now come into custody are generally in a better physical state thanthose received into prison 20 years ago, and the treatment of serious physicalillness forms a smaller part of the work of the prison medical officer than it did.But each prison or borstal has some accommodation for sick people and thereare larger prison hospitals, some with up to 100 beds, to which patients can betransferred if they need treatment not so readily available in their own establish-ments. The prison medical service can call on the consultant and specialist services of the National Health Service and patients can, where necessary, besent to outside hospitals.PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT71. There is a steadily increasing awareness of the need for psychiatric care in custody and the last few years have seen substantial development in the psychi-atric services. About 15 or 20 per cent of all offenders and more than half of all women in custody receive some form of psychiatric treatment during theirsentence. Two-thirds of the full-time medical officers in prisons and borstalshave had psychiatric experience outside the prison medical service and there are40 visiting psycho-therapists. The psychiatric work in prisons is not confined tothe treatment of those who are manifestly ill. There are many offenders whoneed some degree of psychiatric support and supervision at various stages of a sentence, especially a long sentence, and they include, inevitably, some whoapply frequently to see a doctor for what is ostensibly some physical ailment.An important part of the work of medical officers in relation to the prisonsystem as a whole is that of increasing the understanding among staff of all
grades who have to deal day by day with disturbed offenders. It is by this means,as much as by the various forms of medical and psychiatric treatment, that theservice can lower the risk of violent outbursts by unstable offenders in custody.72. Grendon, opened in 1962 as our first psychiatric prison, is pioneering thetreatment of personality disorders in a prison setting, and techniques now being developed at Grendon may be of value in other establishments. There arc otherpsychiatric centres in the prison service at which patients may receive psychi-atric treatment. Both physical and psychological treatments arc available. Atsome establishments special treatment is available for alcoholics, and the prisonmedical service is developing its work with drug addicts.OTHEIl FORMS OF TREATMENT73. Two widely differing examples may be given of the way in which modernmedical techniques can assist in the rehabilitation of offenders. First it is wellknown that a considerable proportion of the young men and women who comeinto custody have been tattooed, and many regret it. Arrangements can be madefor offenders to undergo surgery during sentence for the removal of unwanted orobjectionable tattoos. Secondly there is reason to hope that a small number of abnormal sexual offenders may be helped by the use of hormone therapy as anadjunct to psychotherapy. This is an area in which pioneer work is being donein the prison medical service.THE GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PRISONMEDICAL SERVICE74. The prison medical service has a responsibility for the physical and mentalhealth of all those in custody, and a responsibility to give advice on any aspect oftheir treatment, including living and working conditions, clothing, and diet. the prison medical officer may advise, for example, on the general type of regimemost likely to suit a particular offender. The regular medical and psychiatricreports made on those serving life sentences are of great importance in deciding whether they can safely be released. (The note to Part IV deals with the pro-procedures for considering the future of life sentence prisoners and the periods oftime they should spend in custody.) A major responsibility of the prison medical service concerns unsentenced prisoners. Prison medical officers examine andreport on the physical and mental health of those remanded in custody andawaiting sentence and offer such advice as courts may require. About 13,500such reports were made in 1968*. For this work adequate diagnostic facilities and medical staff must always be available in local prisons and remand centres.DEVELOPMENT OF PRISON HOSPITALS75. The older prisons were built when the simplest physical care of offenderswas the main task of the prison medical service. This situation has altered.Medicine itself has become more complex, and the current need is for the*\n carrying out this work for the courts, as in some other aspects of their work, medical officers have the helpful co-operation of prison psychologists, whose general role in the service is discussed in paragraph 211.
expansion of selected prison hospitals to which patients can be transferred ifthey need treatment not readily available in their own establishment. Principaland Senior Medical Officers already supervise groups of smaller establishmentsto which they act as consultants and advisers. It is intended to develop the largerprison hospitals by reconstruction or rebuilding if necessary as grouphospitals. These should be able to provide a fuller range of treatment facilities,especially in the psychiatric held, as well as making better use of valuablenursing staff; and they already have close and long-standing links with bothN.H.S. and Teaching Hospitals.PHYSICAL EDUCATION76. Physical education and sport have always been seen as a valuable part ofthe regime in establishments for young offenders. Why not for adult establish-ments too ? Here at present the facilities are often poor, but a start is being made.A new training centre for the initial and refresher training of physical educationinstructors, of whom the service now employs about 170, is to be developed atSwinfen Hall, and one of its purposes will be to make a detailed study of the ways in which physical education may assist offenders over the age of 40.77. Where trained staff and adequate facilities are available, the physicaleducation instructor can often help offenders who are not physically fit, bymeans, for example, of remedial gymnastics. Physical fitness is likely to help anoffender in the daily routine of life in custody, enabling a man in a crowded localprison, for example, to come to terms with sedentary occupations making littledemands on mind or body. Sport in prison can be more than an enjoyable formof exercise: it can provide the means of demonstrating a skill, and the offenderwho can prove to himself and to others that he has learnt a skill may improvehis self-respect and gain acceptance in the eyes of other people. Not the least,physical education can assist the return of the offender to the community byhelping to ensure physical competence to take up work outside.EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL training the PURPOSE OF EDUCATION78. Education has been described as an aid to living. It has an important part to play in the life of the prison society, where, as in few other places wherepeople are taught, the best teacher (as Sir Walter Raleigh said) is the one whose main interest is the scholars not the subject. Some prisoners will turn to it forthe relief of boredom to find that it pushes back horizons, occupies time in apersonally satisfying way and increases self-respect. People in custody, as insociety at large, include some who look to education for assistance in under-standing themselves, their fellow men, and the world in which they live and work.At its most utilitarian level it provides a means of acquiring skills which will assist an offender on his return to the community.
THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS79. Education for those in custody remedial, academic, cultural, recreational,vocational is provided by local education authorities at the invitation of the prison Department. In the financial year 1968-69 the cost to the department was just over  600,000. The local education authorities provide &quot;tutor organ-isers&quot;, some full-time, some part-time, who are responsible for the education service in each establishment. There is a small but growing number of full-timeteachers, but the great bulk of teaching is done by part-time teachers.80. All offenders under 21 have to attend a certain number of classes each week, but adults are free to engage in education or not, as they please. Most ofit takes place outside working hours. But daytime education is provided for thosewho lack the basic skills of reading and writing, and normal working hourshave been used for promising experiments in general education for a few selectedoffenders, especially those capable of advanced academic work. Over 200,000individual classes are held each year, covering a wide variety of subjects. they include academic and technical subjects which may in suitable cases lead tooffenders obtaining nationally recognised qualifications, current affairs dis-cussions and, not the least important, the encouragement of handicrafts andhobbies. Under the terms of an award founded by Arthur Koestler in 1962,prizes are available to people in custody for work showing talent in art, literature,and music. The publicity given to these awards, especially by the arrangement ofan annual exhibition, has helped to make more generally known what can beachieved under this kind of encouragement. The Koestler Award was extendedin 1969 to achievements in the field of vocational training and industry.PLANS FOR THE FUTURE81. The present administrative arrangements are largely those recommendedby the Prisoners&apos; Education Advisory Committee in 1947 and conceal a gooddeal of variation, as between one institution and another, in the effectiveness ofthe education provided; a variation due partly to differences in the facilities available, the kind of people in each establishment and their average length ofstay, but partly also to differences in their approach to education. Education in custody is generally least effective when presented as schooling and most effectivewhen treated in an adult way and presented informally to small groups.82. In the light of changes in the penal system and in the organisation of&quot;further education&quot; outside, the Prison Department has started to re-examinethe place of education in the treatment of offenders. An immediate result hasbeen the amalgamation of the education and vocational training units. The aimis to develop them under the guidance of a chief education officer into a &quot;further education&quot; service as that term is understood in the public system outside. TheDepartment is also seeking closer co-operation with local educational authori-t ies, especially in the adult and further education fields, and liaison with voluntary bodies and with teachers&apos; organisations is being strengthened. A review of the recruitment, conditions of service, duties and training of full-time and part-timetutor organisers and teachers has already been made.pr b*
83. The education service, especially in adult establishments, needs betteraccommodation, furniture, teaching aids, and equipment, although the claims for these have to be balanced against other claims. But most important is theneed to relate a prisoners education more closely to all other aspects of histreatment: an aim that is easier to state than to achieve. On the one hand, one ofthe strengths of a further education service is its voluntary character. Withinthe confined life of a closed institution, offenders benefit from taking part inactivities which appear to have no direct connection with the rest of the regime.On the other hand, an offenders education, especially where it involves theacquisition of particular skills, or includes teaching to certain academicstandards, ought to be closely related to his prospects after release.VOCATIONAL TRAINING84. Offenders are prone to believe that the difficulties that got them intoprison will not recur on release if only they can be given a vocational trainingcourse. Often, therefore, they plead for inclusion in such a course withoutrealising what is involved. A vocational training course will in the long runhelp an offender only if (a) it is within his capacities, (b) it provides a skill whichwill assist him in obtaining better employment on his release, and (c) he willhave the opportunity, ability and determination to find and retain such employ-ment. For many offenders, the shorter periods of training, for example in building work, described in paragraph 61, are more suitable. Nevertheless for a minority of offenders a vocational training course leading to an acknowledgedqualification, such as that of the City and Guilds of London Institute, is valuable and appropriate. The Prison Department runs about 100 such courses a year.Most are in borstals. They are spread over 19 trades, including plumbing,welding, and electrical installation. In the financial year 1967-68, 897 peopleentered for public examinations at the end of these courses; 675 were successful.RELIGION AND SOCIAL WORKWORK OF THE CHAPLAIN85. In the past the chaplain has pioneered much of the educational and welfarework among people in custody. The appointment of welfare officers, tutororganisers, and assistant governors has progressively relieved chaplains of suchdemands and given them a new freedom to develop their own contribution tothe treatment of offenders. There are those who argue that, as a chaplain is responsible only for the spiritual welfare of the offenders, he should restrict him-self to giving spiritual, advice and interpreting religion in a narrow sense. Thechaplains reject this view and increasingly regard themselves as members of ateam of people concerned to help offenders. Training, in which chaplains andall ministers of religion share, is designed to help them to take their part with others who are seeking to affect the attitudes and behaviour patterns of the offender. The chaplain makes his own particular contribution and in additionto leading worship and administering the Sacraments he can meet offenders as individuals and remind all in the prison service of the uniqueness of each individual man or woman in his charge.
86. Increasingly, Britain is a multi-racial society, and offenders of differentraces and religions are committed to custody. Tn consultation with representativesof these groups in the community arrangements are made to enable prisoners ofnon-Christian religions to comply with the tenets of their faith in matters of dressand diet.SOCIAL WORK87. There is a particular place for the professional social worker. After con-sidering a report by the then Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders,to which further reference is made in Part IV, the Government decided that from 1st January 1966 prison welfare officer posts should be filled by probationofficers on secondment for limited periods. Prison welfare officers previouslyappointed became probation officers on that date and since then fresh appoint-ments have been made by the secondment of serving probation officers. Thenumber of posts is now about 200, double the 1966 figure. On 1st January 1969the probation and after-care service were also made responsible for filling thesocial worker posts that had already been created in detention centres, remandcentres and borstal allocation centres; and, like the prison welfare officers threeyears before, those in post became probation officers.88. The welfare officer or social worker has an obvious role in giving immediate and &quot;first aid&quot; help with the welfare problems of offenders coming into custody,in acting as the focal point of social work in the institution, and, as explained in Part IV, in providing a link throughout the man&apos;s sentence between theinstitution and the members of the probation and after-care service working in the community. In many establishments, especially the local prisons, sheernumbers do not yet allow the prison welfare officer to undertake case work inany great depth. But at three prisons in the Midlands the number of welfare officers has been substantially increased as part of an attempt to assess theplace of social work in prisons. The experiment is linked with research studiesby the Home Office Research Unit, and although the results are not expectedfor at least another 18 months these investigations and the experiment itselfhave already helped to identify many of the problems of administration and organisation that need to be solved.SOCIAL TRAINING89. Previous paragraphs have described ways in which an offender during hissentence may receive help towards his rehabilitation and ways in which he maybe encouraged to help himself. But if an offender leaves custody thinking only of himself he is unlikely to find a place in a society in which no-one can escapeobligations to other people. Our forefathers were perhaps more confident than we that they knew how moral teaching should be given in prisons. The need forsuch teaching has not diminished, and the offender needs the opportunity andthe encouragement to help other people. He can help those inside the institutionand in many cases can also help those outside it. Offenders are often verygenerous, and their generosity can take the form, for example, of making toysfor handicapped children. In borstals it is possible to go much further; most
borstals maintain close links with other establishments in their areas such asCheshire Homes, psychiatric hospitals and old people&apos;s homes, and the young offenders visit these establishments and offer a range of practical and willinghelp. Detention centres, also, have recently been encouraged to find ways inwhich boys can give help to the community. Such voluntary work helps thepeople to whom it is given. But more profoundly, and sometimes more perman-ently, it helps those who give it. &quot;One must be poor&quot;, as George Eliot said, &quot;toknow the luxury of giving.&quot;
IVOFFENDERS AND THECOMMUNITYFAMILY TIES AND LINKS WITH THE COMMUNITY90. Most of the offenders who leave custody each year and return to the com-munity have spent less than a year &quot;inside&quot;. Those who have had the custody ofthem have increasingly realised the need to see the period inside as an interval between two periods outside, and not the other way round. This Part shows someof the methods that are used to help the offender in custody to see himself asstill a member of society, to preserve his vital links with wife and family, and toassist his reabsorption into the community.LETTERS91. The limits that are still placed on the number of letters, and the number and length of visits, reflect the demands on staff resources for censorship and super-vision, and the lack of space in visiting rooms. In this sphere, as in all too many others, it is the prisoner in the overcrowded local prison whose deprivations arethe most severe. There are security and general reasons why the censorship of letters is necessary, but the Government has reviewed the rules, and in trainingprisons a man may now regularly write three letters a week, on two of whichhe himself meets the cost of postage, and receive the same number.VISITS92. In local prisons priority has to be given to visits to those who are on remandor who have appealed. Because of this, and the poor visiting accommodation,other prisoners may have to be limited to a visit lasting half an hour every four weeks. The Government does not regard this as sufficient. At other establishmentslonger visits are possible, and , at some, visits are now allowed every fortnight.Although many visitors still have to travel considerable distances, and maywelcome help from volunteers in transport for the journey or in looking after thechildren, the decision to allocate as many men as possible to establishmentswithin a Region* has done a good deal to make the visiting of long-term prisonersless difficult. So has the recent change which has enabled those in receipt ofsupplementary benefit, and others not in full-time employment who are equallybadly off, to be assisted each month with the expenses of visiting a relative in prison, and not once in two months as previously. The governor can grantadditional letters and visits when there is a special need for them to help a familyto meet a domestic crisis.*See paragraph 170.
FAMILY PROBLEMS93. It has been said that if prisoners share a single common factor it is theirpropensity to attract problems to themselves; and they are usually family pro-problems. The prisoner can seek help from the prison welfare officer and throughhim from the probation and after-care service outside. He is seen, anyway, bythe welfare officer soon after reception, and his immediate domestic problemscan be referred if necessary to a local probation officer often in touch with the family already and likely to remain so throughout the sentence. When the familygoes to the prison on visits, the welfare officer will often be available to discuss their problems. We are a very long way from being able to provide for all prisoners and their families the skilled social work that they may need, nor,indeed, have we yet discovered how this type of social work is best done in the prison setting, but progress has been made.CREATING NEW LINKS94. Some of those in custody are so isolated that they have no ties with familyor friends. To such men the work of over 750 prison visitors who regularly visitprisons is invaluable. Prison visitors were among the pioneers of voluntary social work in prisons and the unique appeal of the prison visitor remains as one ofthem once put it that &quot;he is unpaid and comes to the prison because he wants to and for no other reason&quot;. Where there are no existing ties to preserve, the attempt is made to forge new ones. Various methods are being tried. At someprisons, for example, the governor will put an isolated offender in touch with a voluntary &quot;associate&quot;, a man willing to attempt to build up a personal relation-ship with him both during sentence and after release. At others the local pro-nation  and after-care service has taken the lead in making similar arrangements.YOUNG OFFENDERS95. The previous paragraphs have been concerned primarily with the inmatesof prisons. In borstals it has always been recognised that the young offendermust be kept in touch with his family. Throughout the sentence there is direct contact between the training borstal and the probation officer who is going to beresponsible for the supervision of the offender when he goes out on licence. in detention centres the problems are different because of the shortness of the sen-tencc, but a social worker in each centre helps the young offender to keep intouch with his family by writing to them and by encouraging visits, and is in regular contact with local colleagues in the probation and after-care service whowill supervise him after release.HOME LEAVE96. Another way of enabling someone in custody to preserve links with familyor friends, or to make new contacts with people who may be able to assist him onrelease, is to allow him to visit them. It has long been the practice to allow young offenders at borstal a period of home leave towards the end of their training.Similar arrangements have existed at some training prisons and for long sentenceprisoners. The Government has recently introduced an extension of home leaveso that prisoners serving sentences of three years or over in training prisons are
now considered for two periods of home leave in the last year of their sentence.Prisoners serving two years and less than three will be considered for one such period. Further extensions of this scheme will be considered when the effects ofthe new arrangements, have been assessed. The Government believe that the granting of home leave in suitable cases is the most promising way of assistingpeople in custody to maintain their family relationship, ft believes this is a pre-transferable alternative to allowing what are called &quot;conjugal visits&quot; by wives. Thereare manifest difficulties in providing acceptable conditions for such visits and a real risk that their artificiality would, on balance, do more harm than good to themarital relationship.THE PERIOD BEFORE RELEASE97. Almost every prisoner needs practical help in the period, immediately before release (though not all will accept it). Whether or not the released prisoneris going to be subject to supervision on release, the prison welfare officer canassist him in finding accommodation before he leaves custody. The Departmentof Employment and Productivity will always help offenders to find, jobs, and representatives of that Department regularly visit institutions to interviewoffenders and to try to place them in employment. All those at borstal, and. all prisoners who have served, long sentences, are given a full set of clothing ondischarge; but these and other practical steps, though important, meet only partof the problem. An offender leaving custody may also face emotional andpsychological problems, the nature of which will vary with his temperament and circumstances and. the length of time he has been in custody. It has long been recognised that someone who has spent any considerable period in any closedcommunity (not only a penal institution) may have difficulty in making the adjustment to life outside, and the aim has been to find various ways of makingthe change from incarceration to complete freedom more gradual. In borstal,the basis of training has always been the gradual widening of the offendersresponsibilities and the range of choices open to him, and. the lessening of controltowards the end. of the period in custody is often accompanied, by a move fromone borstal house to another. Likewise it is fairly common for a prisoner servinga long sentence, including a life sentence, to be transferred to an open prisontowards the end of that sentence.PRE-RELEASE EMPLOYMENT SCHEMES98. Long sentence prisoners may be gradually re-introduced to freedom byleaving the prison every day during the last stage of their sentence and working for a private employer. Any prisoner serving a sentence of 4 years or more(including one serving a life sentence who has been given a date of release) is now considered for outside employment on such a scheme. The detailed arrange-ments vary slightly (and experimentally) from one prison to another; but in essence, a man who is selected, for the scheme is allowed to take work outside the prison for about the last six months of his sentence. He may live in normalaccommodation within the prison, or he may live in a hostel that is separate from, though within the perimeter of, the prison from which he goes out to work
daily. Plans are also being made for opening the first hostel to be physicallyseparated from its parent prison as recommended by Lord Mountbatten in his report on prison security. The hosteller works for a private employer as if he were a free man, receiving normal wages, and meeting people outside the prisonenvironment, and he is able to resume some of the obligations of a free man forexample by supporting his family. At the same time the prison staff can watchhis progress. When the hostel scheme first started at Bristol prison in 1953 it was designed for men sentenced to preventive detention who were in the last monthsof their sentence. Some of these men had spent many years in custody on succes-sive sentences and were so accustomed to life in an institution that they found it extremely difficult to cope with life outside. The scheme has greatly expandedsince then and all long sentence prisoners, including men serving their first period in custody, are now eligible for consideration. There is a similar schemefor women. The main purpose of the scheme remains that of aiding the re-adjustment of people who may have spent long periods of their life in institutions.SELECTION99. It is not possible for all long term prisoners to work for outside employers in this way. Some men will have shown, perhaps by the nature of their offences,perhaps by their behaviour in prison, that they are not suitable. But each case isconsidered on its merits by the governor of the prison, who is advised by a selec-tion board consisting of members of the prison staff who know the man, repre-sentatives of the Board of Visitors or Visiting Committee, and a representative ofthe Department of Employment and Productivity. The aim is to place thoseselected near their homes or near where they intend to settle after release. About1,000 prisoners a year are eligible for consideration for this scheme, and about two thirds of those eligible are selected. There are about 375 places available atany one time. 75 of these places are at Pentonville, 48 at Wormwood Scrubs and46 at Wakefield. The remaining 200 places are divided among 18 other establish-ments in various other parts of the country.SAVINGS100. It is implicit in this gradual re-introduction to freedom that a prisoner isnot given complete control of his weekly wages. The first call on his income isthe amount, if any, being paid by the Department of Health and Social security for the maintenance of his dependents. Then a charge is made for his board andlodging in the prison. He retains any money necessary for fares and lunches, andalso up to 30s. as pocket money. The remainder a minimum of  1 must be saved. Thus a man supports his family, has normal responsibilities, and alsosaves money towards discharge at a rate which usually means that he leavescustody with at least  25, and maybe a good deal more. When the man&apos;s wage is insufficient to support both his family and himself, it is possible to help him byabating the board and lodging charge and by other subsidies. He is allowedweekend leave to visit his home, and a certain degree of freedom during theevenings.RESEARCH101. The Home Office Research Unit is undertaking research into the effects ofthe scheme. The research covers selection, men&apos;s behaviour while in a pre-
release hostel, the attitudes of men and staff to the scheme and a comparison of offences and work records before and after the sentence. Provisional resultsindicate that those who successfully completed the hostel period were slightly less likely to be reconvicted after final discharge than if they had been releaseddirect from prison and that these men seem better able to maintain themselves in work.AFTER CARE102. The development of after-care has followed a pattern to be found in thiscountry in many other services aiming to help people in need. It had its beginningsin voluntary effort in the nineteenth century; it was continued in the twentiethby voluntary organisation, in partnership with public agencies: and it has now become the responsibility of a statutory service the probation and after-careservice. At the same time, and here again the pattern is not unique to after-care,the total task is not one which any statutory service can tackle unaided. The help of members of the community is needed, working under the guidance of trainedprofessional workers.THE NEW ORGANISATION103. The major changes of the last few years were foreshadowed in 1963 by areport from the Home Secretary&apos;s Advisory Council on the Treatment of offenders. This recommended that professional social workers should beemployed on after-care, both in penal institutions and in the community, and thatthere should be a greater use and involvement of community resources in the rehabilitation of offenders. These recommendations were accepted. The enlarge-ment of the probation service into a probation and after-care service was givenformal effect in the Criminal Justice Act 1967. The Government also decided thatsocial workers in prisons and detention centres should belong to, and be drawn from, the probation and after-care service. (The present arrangements for borstalafter-care are dealt with in Part VI.) By 1967 therefore the foundations had been laid for a unified professional after-care service.OFFENDERS LIABLE TO RECALL104. Offenders who were under 21 when sentenced are subject to supervision inthe community after release from custody. So are (a) those adult offendersgranted early release on licence under the new parole scheme referred to inparagraph 114; (b) those subject to an extended sentence (whether paroled ornot); and (c) those released on licence from a sentence of life imprisonment. Foroffenders in these categories, supervision in the community is part of the sentence;and the sanction of recall to custody exists in the event of failure to observe theterms of supervision. Apart from these, most adult offenders are not subject to recall or to compulsory after-care, but they are encouraged by prison welfare officers to take advantage, voluntarily, of the after-care that is offered.THE PURPOSE OF AFTER-CARE105. The aim of after-care, whether or not it is backed by the sanction of recallto custody, is not only to assist the offender on his return to society but also to
give him. continuing help with fundamental problems that may have got himinto trouble. The licence provides an element of control and stability during theperiod of resettlement when an offender is at greatest risk. Used imaginatively, itcan set limits whilst the individual builds up his own controls; for in this processof re-adjustment after-care gives the offender the help of a skilled caseworker whowill not only assist him directly but may also mobilise on his behalf the resourcesof the community provided either by statutory or voluntary agencies or by individuals.THE WORK OF THE PROBATION OFFICER106. if the offender is to derive the maximum benefit from after-care, itsfoundations need to be laid early in his sentence. It is easier to do this if the offender or his family have already had some contact with the local probationand after-care service. More and more often, a probation officer will have seen the offender while he was making a social inquiry for the court before sentence.After sentence the probation officer at the court tries to see him to discuss anyurgent domestic or other problems with him, and to make sure that, if he has a wife and family, they are given help and advice while he is in custody. So far asis practicable, and this depends on the availability of staff as well as on theattitude of the family, contact is maintained both with the family and with the prisoner during sentence, and the probation officer will try to visit the prisonerbefore his discharge to discuss plans for his future.107. Which would be the more effective, voluntary after-care on a more intensive scale or compulsory after-care for more and more offenders? There is evidence that the approach described in the previous paragraphs is providing the answer. With the encouragement of the probation and after-care service, and, inparticular, of the prison welfare officers, more adult prisoners are making use of&quot;voluntary after-care&quot; facilities. In 1966, the first year in which the probation andafter-care service became fully responsible for it, 18,522 prisoners had somecontact with the service after release. In 1967 this figure increased to 22,441,contact being maintained also for longer periods. This trend continued in 1968and it may well be that experience will confirm that it was right to have contem-plated the extension of voluntary after-care rather than a general extension of compulsory after-care to larger groups of adult prisoners.OTHER AGENCIES108. Because the probation and after-care service is a nation wide service, the probation officer being equipped by his training to carry out this form of social work, it is right that the major contribution to after-care should be made by that service, and by probation officers in the districts to which offenders go on release.The work of the service can and should, however, be supplemented in various ways, including the continuing interest of members of the prison service informer offenders. At a few establishments members of the staff who have been concerned with individual offenders have been encouraged to maintain contact with them after discharge; and this is particularly appropriate where the staff have developed special skills in the handling of disturbed offenders and havewon their trust.
VOLUNTARY EFFORT109. As indicated in paragraph 102 the individual citizen will always have a part to play in the many social services that aim to help people in need, and nowhereis this more so than in achieving the main object of prisoners&apos; after-care: thereintegration of the offender within the community. In 1965 the Governmentappointed a Working Party under the Dowager Marchioness of Reading toadvise on the best possible use of this voluntary effort, and it has produced twovaluable reports.110. Probation officers are increasingly recognising the value of volunteers, ofwhom there are now over 1,200 working actively in conjunction with the pro-nation  and after-care service. They provide a wide range of support from baby-minding during prison visits and collecting prisoners&apos; luggage, to the long-termbefriending of wives and families during the prisoners absence and of the wholefamily after his release. The work of such a volunteer, or &quot;associate&quot; as he ismore usually called, can best be summarised as the provision for an ex-prisoner of someone who will befriend him, knows and accepts his story of past failure,and is willing actively to help him to a more successful future. It is someone towhom he can turn for guidance and advice on matters often outside the range ofthe official agencies, and whose help is sometimes as simple as the filling up of a form, the drafting of a letter, or the making of a telephone call. The &quot;associated&quot;main strength lies in the fact that he has a status which his protege has tempo-temporarily lost, and that he is willing to use it for his protege&apos;s benefit; for the latter&apos;sbiggest loss is usually his self-esteem, the most profound consequence of imprison-ment. A housing society has been formed to help to prevent the break-up of families as a result of imprisonment, and many other voluntary societies andtrusts are finding ways of helping ex-offenders, including helping them to findjobs, and of providing the financial means. Supplementary financial support isprovided by the Home Office for approved organisations undertaking such work.AFTER-CARE HOSTELSHI. A particular field in which voluntary organisations have always taken a leading part is the provision of hostels for offenders. The substantial number of offenders who have nowhere to go on release obviously face special difficulties,and experience shows that they are very likely to return to prison, often afterconviction for comparatively minor offences. The Government decided, havingconsidered a Report by the Working Party mentioned in paragraph 109 that itwas right to retain the voluntary and non-official character of after-care hostels,which is known to make them more acceptable to those who would use them, butalso that Government financial help should be made available to them.FINANCIAL PROVISION112. Grants have accordingly been given since 1965 to those hostels which provide personal help and support for offenders in addition to reasonablestandards of board and lodging. The condition of grant is that the offenders inthe hostel have been discharged from custody in the preceding twelve months or are subject to compulsory supervision. The grant is designed to help to meet thedifference between contributions from residents to their board and lodging andthe running costs of the hostel. The annual grant per place was increased from
 100 to  125 in April of this year. The Government also recognised the difficultiesfacing hostels which aimed to give continued support to certain groups of formerprisoners with special problems for example, alcoholics and a higher annualgrant with a maximum of  200 per place for hostels meeting these special needs,introduced in 1968, was increased to  225 on 1st April of this year. At present 72such hostels receive grants in respect of 774 places for former prisoners.113. Some voluntary bodies have not found it easy to raise the capital needed to build or extend hostels. In 1967 a Housing Association was formed to acquire,convert and hold properties to be managed by voluntary bodies as after-carehostels. It is rim by an honorary committee, but the Home Office has made grants to meet administrative costs and to provide some working capital. It can obtaingrants and loans from local authorities on the same basis as any other housing association. The Government hopes to see a considerable increase in this kind ofhostel provision for former prisoners in the next few years.PAROLEOUTLINE OF THE SCHEME114. Under section 60 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, every prisoner serving(in effect) a fixed sentence of imprisonment of over 18 months is eligible forconsideration for parole when he has served one third of his sentence, or 12months, whichever is the longer. Unless he specifically declines the opportunity,each prisoner who is eligible for parole has his case considered by a local review committee at the prison in which he is detained. The committee reports to theHome Office, and all cases in which a committee thinks a prisoner suitable forparole are now referred by the Home Office to the Parole Board. Additionally,some cases are referred which the local committee has not deemed suitable.No prisoner may be released on licence unless the Board recommends release tothe Home Secretary.* The licence prescribes the conditions with which the prisoner must comply while on parole, and the Board has statutory responsibilityfor advising the Home Secretary what these conditions should be. Where a manon parole is in breach of the conditions of his licence, the Home Secretary may refer the case to the Board which considers whether he should be recalled. (If therecall is urgent, the Home Secretary may authorise it himself, but the case has tobe considered by the Board as soon as possible).RESULTS SO FAR115. The Parole Board, under the chairmanship of Lord Hunt, began con-sidcring cases in November 1967 and the first prisoners were released on licenceon 1st April 1968 when the relevant provisions of the Act came into force. TheBoard is an independent body, and in its initial report it gives a full account ofthe first year&apos;s work and that of the local review committees. By 30th September1969 the Home Secretary had accepted the Board&apos;s recommendation to release2,500 prisoners on licence. Only 91 of them had to be recalled during this period.The Government believes that the results so far achieved, and the very small number of offenders whose licences have had to be revoked, are encouraging and go far to justify the hopes expressed when the scheme was introduced. Thefollowing table gives the figures in more detail:*Scc note at the end of this Part about life sentence prisoners.fThe Report of the Parole Board for 1968. Qouse of Commons paper 290.

A STAGE IN REHABILITATION116. It is only a minority, although an increasing minority, of prisoners whoare found suitable for parole. For them release on licence represents an importantstage in the process of rehabilitation, a stage during which an offender who would otherwise be still in prison is assisted to resettle in the community with the help and supervision of a probation officer. In considering whether a prisoner issuitable for release the local review committee, the Home Office, and. the ParoleBoard need to know about his past record, the circumstances of his offence, hissocial background, his general attitude and response in prison, and his probablecircumstances on release. In the past these matters have often been looked, at in isolation; the home conditions and. the likely circumstances on release have appeared to be the concern of the probation and after-care service, and theoffenders time in custody the concern of the prison service. The introduction ofthe parole scheme has made more apparent than ever the need for a continuity of approach and treatment. This has led the prison service to keep better records ofthe information available about each prisoner who will become eligible forparole. Even more important, it has reminded, all those who deal with the prisoner of the need to look outwards towards his return to the community andnot to sec a spell in custody as a self-contained episode.THE PROBATION SERVICE AND PAROLE117. Members of the probation and after-care service provide information about an offenders social background both at the time of his conviction and.when he is being considered for parole. Reports by flic prison welfare officers arcavailable to local review committees and to the Parole Board. When it has beendecided that an offender should, be released, on licence, the arrangements for his release are discussed, between the prison welfare officer and the probation officer who will be supervising the offender after release. The probation and after-careservice thus plays an essential part in the earliest stages of a man&apos;s preparation for release, as well as giving him skilled assistance during the period of super-vision.RESEARCH118. There is no doubt that the introduction of the new arrangements hasaffected the attitudes and responsibility of the prison service and. of the probationand after-care service, and has had. the incidental but valuable effect of strengthen-ing the co-operation that was growing between them. It is too early to judge thesuccess of the new legislation in its primary aim of assisting the resettlement of offenders. Research is being carried, out on the effect of the scheme on all prisoners eligible for parole and also into the methods of selecting prisoners for release.THE EFFECTS IN THE PRISON119. Account must also be taken of the effect of the scheme on the majority ofprisoners who are not granted early release. In 1968 there was some anxiety lestrefusals might not only embitter the individuals concerned but also have an
adverse elTecl: on Ihe general atmosphere of the prison. These gloomy forecastshave not been fulfilled. The prison stall&apos; dealing with men serving very longsentences who arc not suitable for parole have the difficult laslc of helping (hemto come to terms with their situation, but the provision for regular review means that the prisoner serving a long fixed sentence need not feel that all is lost if as aresult of a review he is not released on licence. Iliscase must be reviewed againafter 12 months provided that a month or more on licence would still bepossible and may be reviewed after a period shorter than this. Parole hasalready become an accepted part of the prison scene, viewed with hope orcynisism according to Ihe temperament of the offender, but offering Ihe possi-bility to many that they can affect their own future by their own efforts.NOTE TO PART IVLife Sentence PrisonersThe previous paragraphs, and the figures given in them, have referred only to prisoners serving fixed sentences of imprisonment. The Parole Hoard also adviseson the release of life sentence prisoners (or persons detained during Her Ma jesly&apos;pleasure). Because these sentences are indeterminate and Ihe risk to Ihe publicpotentially greater, (he release of such prisoners is governed, by a somewhat different procedure. Each case is carefully considered at an early stage and a date is fixed for review, normally after four years, though in rare cases a review may lieheld earlier. This review at four years is carried out in the Home Ollice, its main purpose being lo decide whether, exceptionally, Ihe local review committeeshould, be asked Lo review the case within the following two years. Such a reviewis unusual. The usual practice is to seek the views of the local review committeeafter an offender has served seven years whether or not it appears likely that a provisional release date can reasonably be fixed. (Such a dale is usually fixed ayear in advance.) The Home Ollice considers the ease and forwards it to IheParole Hoard whether or not the committee before&apos;s recommendation is favourable. TheLord. Chief Justice, and the trial judge if available, must by law be consulted before any prisoner in this category is released. The note on page 000 deals withthe actual periods likely to be served in different cases.
VASSESSMENT AND RESEARCHINTRODUCTION120. This White Paper has now described some of the work of the prison service and some of the methods used in the treatment of offenders. Whatresults are being achieved? Some things can be measured: the rise in the outputof prison industries or the fall in the number of escapes. But we have no effective means at present of measuring other things: the value, for example, of the educational programme of a borstal, or of the psychiatric treatment provided in a prison. Nor have we the means of estimating the cost to the community ofthe crimes that the offender might have committed had he not been confined tocustody. We must try through research and the use of new financial and economictechniques to find ways of evaluating the results of the prison system as a whole,but this is not an easy task and we are a long way from being able to make suchcomprehensive assessments.121. Nor can one generalise about the effect on offenders of their treatment in custody. The testimony of those offenders who write books and articles aboutprisons is not necessarily representative, or even accurate, although it cannot be ignored merely because it is not in general nattering to authority. A morefavourable picture can be drawn by using the testimony of those offenders whoexpress appreciation of efforts made by the staff to help them, but it would be equally unwise to place too much reliance on them. We must also remember,and this is the vital importance of after-care, that it is what happens to anoffender after he has left custody, rather more than what happened to him in custody, that may determine whether or not he returns to crime.RECONVICTION RATES122. Information can and should be collected about how many offenders areagain convicted after release. There are, however, certain weaknesses andlimitations about the use of &quot;reconviction rates&quot; as a means of measuring theresults of a form of penal treatment. It must never be assumed that an offenderwho goes straight after release does so because of what happened to him in custody. Nor must it be assumed that an offender has gained no benefit fromhis treatment in prison or borstal because he again comes before the courts.His reconviction may be for a relatively minor and isolated offence as a resultof which he may not return to custody and which may not prevent him from becoming an acceptable and useful member of society. Finally, because offenders,even those serving similar sentences, vary so widely in their temperaments,backgrounds, and criminal or non-criminal careers, an average reconvictionrate may conceal such wide variations as, of itself, to be of little significance.
123. All this should be borne in mind in considering the information given inthe following paragraphs. The figures given come from a combination of statistics now obtained by the Home Office Statistical Division and the resultsof special research by the Home Office Research Unit*.ADULT OFFENDERS124. There are no figures yet available to show the average reconviction ratesof all adults released from imprisonment. Indeed they form so heterogeneous a group that such general figures would hardly be useful. The following infor-mation is based mainly on records of adult men released from sentences of over18 months&apos; imprisonment during 1965. Slightly more than half the men whohave served sentences of more than 18 months for an indictable offence arereconvicted within two years of release from prison. Only a small, and diminish-ing, number of offenders are now sent to prison for a first offence. Of thesefirst offenders, 90 per cent are not reconvicted within two years of release. At theother extreme, more than two-thirds of persistent offenders released afterserving sentences of 4 years or more are reconvicted within two years of release.YOUNG OFFENDERS125. There are also a wide variety of young offenders in custody at any onetime, ranging from a few with no previous convictions to those who have oftenoffended before; and some of the latter will already have experienced the full range of methods at the disposal of the courts. The figures t show that, on average, between 55 per cent and 60 per cent of young offenders released fromsenior detention centres are reconvicted within three years. So are about 70 percent of those released from borstal. Of the young men released on licence fromprison after sentences of over three months about 75 per cent are reconvictedwithin three years.126. These are average figures, and it is the general experience with offendersof all ages that first offenders are less likely, and offenders with several offencesare more likely, than the average to offend again. About one in eight of the boysat detention centres and one in thirty of those at borstal were first offenders,and the information available suggests that the reconviction rates for these firstoffenders were in each case about 20 per cent lower than the averages given inthe previous paragraph. So, for example, only 40 per cent of first offendersreleased from senior detention centres were reconvicted within three years.127. On the other hand, young offenders with a series of previous convictionscould be expected to have reconviction rates worse than the average. A courtdealing with an offender under 17 is nowadays unlikely to make an approvedschool order until the boy concerned has appeared before the courts on several occasions; similarly borstal or imprisonment are sentences given to the more*While a good deal of statistical information is available about offenders sent to detention centres and borstals the information about prisoners has in the past been inadequate. TheHome Office Statistical Division have introduced new systems which should provide betterstatistical information in future not only about the reconviction rates but for other purposes.tBecause of the use of the three year &quot;follow-up&quot; period, the latest figures available are those for offenders released in 1965 and for reconvictions up to 1968.
serious offenders, many of whom have experienced the range of institutionalsentences available to the courts for juvenile offenders. It is not thereforesurprising that young offenders for whom past institutional treatment hasalready proved unavailing should have reconviction rates which are 10-15 percent higher than the appropriate averages quoted in paragraph 125. Thus as many as 80-85 per cent of young men released from borstal with past experienceof juvenile institutions were reconvicted within 3 years.128. To some these rcconviction rates will seemdauntingly high; they certainlyreflect the measure of the problem which the staff in detention centres andborstals have to face and live with. But it is right to sec the figures in positiveterms. The following table summarises the information in the three previousparagraphs in terms of the proportion of young offenders who were not recon-victed within three years of leaving a senior detention centre or borstal.Type of Offender Percentage NOT reconvictedwithin three years ofleavingDetentionCentres BorstalsFirst Offenders (a)       ........       60-65 50Offenders  with  several  offences  who   had previously attended approved schools (b) ..       30-35 15-20All offenders      ..........       40-45 30(a) The proportion of first offenders among those received into detention centres and borstals was 12 and 3 per cent respectively.(b) These offenders accounted for 11 and 35 per cent respectively of allreceptions at detention centres and borstals.129. Changes in the type of offender sent to custody arc likely to producechanges in the rcconviction rates for that type of custody. An apparent worseningin the records of those released from borstal may therefore be due to an increasedproportion of young men who reach borstal only after the courts have triedother methods of dealing with them. Allowance can be made for these changes and calculations done of the number of the various groups of offenders who, inthe light of experience, can be expected to be reconvicted. When the necessaryallowances have been made, the changes in the reconviction rates of young offenders released from custody arc seen to be in line with changes in the type ofoffender committed to custody in the last few years.PERSISTENT OFFENDERS130. What really matters to the community is not so much the number of young offenders who are reconvicted on one occasion after release as the numberwho repeatedly commit further offences and end among the hard core of thepersistent adult offenders. Of the 70 per cent of those released from borstal whoarc reconvicted, perhaps one fifth to one quarter are reconvicted only once and thereafter stay clear of further trouble. Those young offenders most likely tocontinue in a life of crime are those who are first found guilty at an early age.Any study of adult prisoners shows a high proportion of those whose criminal
career started early and even, for example, among long sentence prisoners atDartmoor, a record of early offending and early institutional experience con-tinues, statistically speaking, to increase the chances of reconviction manyyears later. This persistent recidivism, whose roots may go back to an offenderschildhood, illustrates the importance of the measures which the Government istalcing to deal more effectively with offenders under 17. It also represents (hemost intractable problem confronting the prison system of this and othercountries, on which much more work needs to be done.RESEARCH131. To find other answers to the question &quot;what is achieved&quot; we must turn to the results of research. It is not the purpose of this White Paper to attempta summary of the present slate of knowledge in penology and criminology;these disciplines cover a very wide field of which research on custodial sentences(particularly prison sentences) constitutes as yet a relatively small part. It seemsappropriate, however, to give a brief outline of the main aims of such research,some of the conclusions suggested by the results so far obtained, and a shortsummary of future plans.AIMS132.   The aims of research on custodial sentences may be set out as follows:(a) It is generally agreed that imprisonment, or any custodial sentence,may serve several purposes: for example, protecting the public by keeping offenders segregated from the community; acting as a deter-renl to potential (or actual) criminals; and providing an opportunityfor reform or rehabilitation. Investigation of the extent to which allthese purposes are fulfilled or could be belter fulfilled should be themain object of research in the prison system; and it is the last of themthai requires the greatest research effort.(b) Research, then, has to evaluate the effectiveness of imprisonmentcompared with other kinds of sentence -lines, probation and so on -and also has to study the relative value of various methods of dealingwith different types of people serving custodial sentences. Older,well-established routines have to be studied, as well as newer and more promising techniques suggested by experience or by the results of research itself.(c) Continuing observation and assessment of the organisation and management of the prison system is needed if research is to be of real value to it. Such work includes the collection and transmission to management of information about the working of the system, includ-ing the study of communications and, the structure of responsibility,the way in which staff are employed, and their roles vis-a-vis the prisoners.CURRENT STATE OP RESEARCH133. The Note at the end of this Part lists some investigations being carriedout. The list is not comprehensive, but indicates the main areas of current
research. A broad, imprecise distinction can be drawn between descriptiveresearch (the attempt to state with authority what is happening a task not aseasy as it sounds) and evaluative research (the attempt to assess the results ofwhat is done).134. The greater part of research effort so far has been devoted to attempts to evaluate the effects of different kinds of sentence on offenders&apos; subsequentcriminal careers. The fact that a known proportion of discharged prisoners arenot convicted again does not of itself tell us anything about the efficacy of theway in which they were treated in custody. We need to estimate, for we can never know, what would have happened to a prisoner if the court or the prisonsystem had dealt with him in some other way. We can attempt this by comparing the subsequent criminal records of similar groups of offenders given differentsentences or allocated to different kinds of routine or regime. A difficultyimmediately arises. Such comparisons would be completely valid only if the individuals in the experiment had been allocated randomly to the differentsentences or regimes in the first place. This is something that, for obvious reasons, is not ordinarily possible. The alternative is to make statistical correc-tions for relevant differences between the groups before making the final com-parison.135. Investigations carried out so far suggest that fairly crude measures of anoffenders past criminal history have a closer statistical association with hisfuture criminality than either the decision of the court or what happens to him in custody. This suggests that prison or other penal measures have only a limitedbeneficial effect on offenders, but it may also mean that we have not yet learntto select the best way of treating different types of offender, so that bad effects on some cancel out the good effects on others.136. Much further work remains to be done in order to see whether differences in the personality and social backgrounds of criminals can be used effectively to make some broad classification for the most hopeful forms of treatment.Such research may also suggest new and better forms of treatment, and anythat are promising must be tried out and evaluated.137. Research has confirmed already that a steady proportion of recidivistprisoners are basically inadequate people who cannot cope unaided with thedemands of life &quot;outside&quot; and who have never had, or have lost, the familyand other ties that assist more fortunate citizens in times of difficulty. such people clearly need long-term support, but the right way to provide this is not by successive periods in prison. Development of hostels and &quot;half-way houses&quot;may well prove a more successful and economical alternative. Research has also indicated that reconviction rates would not be reduced if a larger proportionof offenders were committed to custody, or if those imprisoned were given longersentences. A policy of keeping as many offenders as possible out of custody stillseems the correct one and will continue to shape Government plans.FUTURE RESEARCH138. Plans drawn up by the Home Office Research Unit, and now underconsideration, include proposals for a detailed description of the male prison
population and of prison routines and regimes, particularly of work in prisonsand the attitudes of staff and prisoners to it. A good deal of previous research in penology has been concentrated on young offenders, but little has been done to attempt to describe the adult male population in prisons the large majorityof people for whom the Department has to provide; nor has there yet beenenough scientific description of the treatment that prisoners receive or of theirreaction to it. Investigation of regimes, and their evaluation, lead naturally tothe study of attitudes among staff and prisoners, to observation of the variousroles that staff are required to play in the course of their work and of the effectof all this on the prisoners themselves.NOTE TO PART VCURRENT RESEARCH PROJECTS(See Paragraph 133)Research Supported by Home Office GrantCambridge University (Institute of Criminology)An evaluative study of the training programme of a medium security borstal.A study of the nature and origins of parole and an examination of the operationof two American parole systems.A descriptive study of the prison population at Birmingham, and of transfer toand from other prisons.Durham UniversityAn investigation of psychological changes associated with long-term imprison-ment.London University (University College)A comparison and follow-up study of boys aged 17-20 in borstals, prisons anddetention centres.Borough PolytechnicResearch into certain aspects of parole.Manchester UniversityA general sociological study of Styal prison for women.Maudsley Hospital, Institute of PsychiatryA study of women offenders in Holloway prison.Oxford UniversityThe use of Part V of the Mental Health Act, 1959, including transfers from penalinstitutions to mental hospitals under sections 72 and 73 of the Act.A population study of Oxford Prison.Southampton UniversityAn investigation of the social difficulties which arise from a conviction for a criminal offence.

vi the STRATEGY OF the prison SYSTEMINTRODUCTION139. This Part of the White Paper deals in turn with the main groupings of thepresent system, namely those dealing with women and girls, with young menunder 21, and with men over 21. It summarises the present strategy of eachpart of the system. It then describes a building programme that appears, in thelight of the current strategy, to make the best use of available resources.THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON THE PENAL SYSTEM140. It is the Government^ responsibility to determine the priorities of the prison system, and to attempt in the light of available resources to direct changes to consistent aims. Advice is available from outside as well as inside the service.In particular the Government seeks advice from the Advisory Council on the penal System. This Council, which was set up in 1966, is a strong, expert andbroadly based body under the chairmanship of Mr. Kenneth Younger. It has a present membership of 18 on which both Houses of Parliament, the judiciary,the social sciences and the police are represented. Its terms of reference are:&quot;To make recommendations about such matters relating to the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders as the Home Secretary may from time totime refer to it, or as the Council itself, after consultation with the Home Secre-tary, may decide to consider&quot;. In addition to an important study of non-custodial penalties there are two other current inquiries by the Council: into the detention centre system and into the possibility of giving the concept of repar-ation by the offender a more prominent place in our penal system. The AdvisoryCouncil has already completed studies (which have been published) of the regime for long term prisoners in conditions of maximum security (see para-graph 176) and the suitability of the detention centre as a method of treatment for young women and girls (see paragraph 144).WOMEN AND GIRLS141. In 1968 the Government made a thorough review of the way in which the prison system should deal with women and girls, and the Home Secretaryannounced its conclusions in a Parliamentary statement in December of thatyear. The number of women and girls in custody is small. In 1968 it averaged805, a figure that has not changed much since 1938 although in that time the male population in custody has trebled. The following table shows how thepopulation of women&apos;s institutions was made up:
	Age under 21 at	Average Population 1968	time of reception	Age 21 and	or conviction	overUntried	44	58Convicted, unsentenced	43	32Awaiting removal to approved school	3	 Civil prisoners		2Sentenced		6 months and under	11	125Over 6 months to 18 months	2	137Over 18 months to 3 years	3	85Over 3 years, under 10 years	2	44   -10 years and over, including life sentences	1	12In borstals	178	-In a detention centre*	23	 TOTAL	310	495Nearly 50 per cent of the women and girls who receive custodial sentences areguilty of offences against property. Others have been convicted of offencesrelating to prostitution (over 20 per cent), drunkenness (about 15 per cent),violence or assault, cruelty to children and, in a very small number of cases,murder. There is a relatively small group of offenders who have been imprisonedfor arson, drug offences, bigamy and motoring offences.AIMS142. The Government sees no reason to expect any considerable increase in thenumber of women and girls in custody in the foreseeable future. New develop-ments in penal treatment, including those that may result from the review nowbeing made by the Advisory Council on the Penal System of non-custodial and semi-custodial treatment, may result in a decrease. The Governments aim,therefore, is to provide adequate facilities for the treatment of the relatively small number of women and girls in custody, together with the considerablerange of specialist facilities and the high staff ratio that experience shows to benecessary. There must also be sufficient flexibility to meet additional demands and to enable facilities to be modified in the light of future developments.143. The aims of the prison service are the same for women and girls as formen, and, although some methods of treatment may differ, many of the methodsof treatment mentioned in Parts III and IV are applicable to women. They need,for example, constructive work, the personal interest of the staff, and religiousand educational support. Many women in custody are clearly in need of medical and psychiatric treatment. This must take place within a regime in which good order and discipline are maintained, but, except for a small minority of women*Now closed (see paragraph 144).PR C
prisoners, the element of security is not so important, and in the management of the women&apos;s prison system there has been a steady tendency towards relaxingcontrol.CLOSING OF DETENTION CENTRE144. The Government has decided that the women&apos;s system need no longerinclude a detention centre. The Advisory Council on the Penal System, whichhas been reviewing the general operation of detention centres, made an interimreport about detention centres for girls. The Council concluded that short periods of custodial training were in principle undesirable for girls, and that, ingeneral, girls sent to the former detention centre at Moor Court would havebeen better dealt with either by non-custodial treatment or by the sentence ofborstal training which would have provided the longer period of treatmentthat many of them require.THE SHAPE OF THE SYSTEM145. With the closure of the detention centre at Moor Court there are now 10establishments holding women and girls. (In four of them, as the list on page 00shows, women&apos;s units are attached to male establishments.) The total capacityof about 1,100 places is adequate, but about half of them are in the obsolescentbuilding at Holloway. Very small institutions are not economic and cannotprovide the range of facilities needed. Since the number of women and girls in custody is small, the Government cannot plan to provide prisons and borstalsfor them in all parts of the country, and some offenders have inevitably to besent a considerable distance from their homes. Married quarters are not providedfor women officers and nursing sisters, so that the availability of locally recruitedstaff is an important factor in planning the system. Moreover, a women&apos;s prisonneeds to be where outside consultants can readily visit patients and where accessis convenient to other visitors.146. The Government has decided to create a northern and southern complex of female establishments. Each will have closed and open prisons, remandfacilities, a closed borstal and adequate psychiatric resources. It is feasible tomaintain only one open borstal for the whole country. The northern complexwill be based on the existing prison at Styal. Holloway will be the centre of thesouthern complex. The Holloway buildings, especially the present hospitalfacilities, are inadequate, but the site meets the needs indicated in the previous paragraph, and will be totally redeveloped to provide the principal women&apos;sestablishment in the country. Because most women and girls in custody require some form of medical, psychiatric or remedial treatment, priority will be givenin the redevelopment of Holloway to the construction of a new hospital. It will thus become a medically-orientated establishment with the comprehensive,versatile and secure hospital as its central feature. The redevelopment of Hollowayis a major project and the planning for the design and construction of the new building, and for the training and selection of staff, is in its early stages. TheGovernment hopes, however, that within the next ten years the redevelopmentof Holloway will have been completed and that the general policy announced to Parliament last year will have been fully implemented.
MALE YOUNG OFFENDERSREMAND CENTRES147. About 12 per cent of the young men in custody at any one time are onremand: that is they are either awaiting trial or, having been convicted, are heldwhile enquiries are being made to assist the courts to decide how best to dealwith them. Only a small proportion of these young men will be sentenced to imprisonment, and they ought not to be held on remand in a prison. In the last ten years, special remand centres* have been opened for both young men and young women. These centres have two main purposes. First, to detain in suitableand secure conditions those remanded in custody by the courts, and to providethe facilities, including those for visiting by solicitors, probation officers andrelatives to which an unsentenced person is entitled. Second, to provide a service to the courts by the assessment of these unsentenced persons by exper-experienced staff, including medical staff. There is not yet enough separate accommo-dation for all young offenders under 21 remanded in custody, and until thebuilding programme described in paragraph 192 is completed some must continue to be held in local prisons.148. It had been intended that remand centres should eventually provide facilities for the detention and assessment of adults as well as those under 21,and the purpose-built centre at Risley has this role. For the reasons explained in paragraph 164 the Government now feels that, in most parts of the country,adults on remand should be detained in local prisons, leaving remand centres todeal with those under 21.DETENTION CENTRES149. About 6,000 young men are sent each year to a senior detention centre.Most are sentenced to three months&apos; detention, less remission, but about one ineight receive a six months&apos; sentence. (For more details about the records ofthese young men see the Appendix.) The 13 seniort detention centres for youngmen aged 17-21 contain about 1,500 places and now serve courts in all parts ofthe country. In 1968, for the first time, the supply of vacancies was generallysufficient to meet the current demand. There is one open centre, North SeaCamp. The others are closed establishments with a relatively high degree of security.150. In July 1967 the then Home Secretary asked the Advisory Council on the penal System to review the operation of detention centres, and the Council setup a sub-committee for this purpose under the chairmanship of the Bishop ofExeter. This review was timely because of past and current changes in theregimes at these centres. Statutory provision for detention centres had beenmade in the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and the statements then made suggested*They are listed in the note on page 00.$There are also 5 junior detention centres for boys aged 14-16. The Government will in due course be ready to discuss with local authorities ways in which these facilities might be incor-porated within new schemes of supervision or residence of the type described in the white paper &quot;Children in Trouble&quot; and provided for in the Children and Young Persons Act 1969*
that the centres were intended primarily as a deterrent and that regimes shouldbe relatively punitive. Experience of operating the centres soon showed thatdespite the short length of sentence there was opportunity for positive training.In consequence the regimes now, although brisk and well disciplined, also aim to incorporate a good deal of moral and social training in the teaching of self-discipline. The main Report of the Advisory Council is expected to be publishedsoon.BORSTALS151. Very few of the 5,000 young men sentenced to borstal training each year are first offenders. The Appendix gives the figures. The borstal sentence is tosome extent an indeterminate one it is for not less than six months and notmore than two years; and it includes a statutory period of supervision afterthe completion of the custodial training. As soon as possible after sentence toborstal, young offenders are sent to allocation centres. At present these centresare in unsuitable buildings in separate wings of the adult prisons at manchester and Wormwood Scrubs. The Government intends to replace them as soon aspossible by two new purpose-built allocation centres one at Glen Parva, nearLeicester, and another in the South. The staff of an allocation centre make an assessment of each young offender, taking account of his background beforesentence, his mental and intellectual ability, his age, his degree of criminalsophistication and the likelihood of his seeking or taking an opportunity toabscond. The offender then goes to one of the training borstals listed in the note on page 00 which aim to provide a range of regimes to deal with the various types of offender.TRAINING152. A high proportion of those sentenced to borstal training have been ininstitutions before, whether in approved schools or detention centres or both.The proportion has increased in the last few years, and more of those at borstalseem criminally sophisticated. Research data has provided independent con-firmation of the impression of borstal governors that they have a higher propor-tion of difficult people to deal with. A smaller proportion are now suitable fortraining in open borstals. As a result the greatest pressure in the last few years has been on the closed borstals and those allocated to them have had on occasion to wait for several weeks or months in unsuitable conditions before transfer.The Government is considering the possibility of providing closed units inotherwise open establishments, as for example at Hollesley Bay, so as to adjust the balance of the system to these changing needs. The term &quot;closed borstal&quot; is perhaps misleading. The security of a borstal is important, but it is not and isnot intended to be absolute; and a considerable number of boys in &quot;closed&quot;establishments can expect to spend a proportion of the day on outside working parties. Some of those sentenced to borstal are transferred from closed to openunits during the course of their training, and others may be selected to go out towork under arrangements made with private firms.DEVELOPMENTS IN BORSTAL TRAINING153. Something was said in Parts III and IV about the treatment of offendersfn borstal. It is well worth emphasising again that the borstal regime is so devised
that the staff can get to know individually each one of a small group of offenders.(A small number of women are being appointed as Assistant Governors in suitable male borstals.) An important recent development is one at Ipswichunder which young offenders work for outside employers and from an early stage of their borstal sentence live in a small house in the town. This house is associated with the open borstal at Hollesley Bay and is staffed by officers fromthat borstal. Suitable young men are selected within the first month of their arrival at Hollesley Bay and can spend the rest of their sentence at the house,going out to work for employers in Ipswich. The sanction of return to a normalborstal is always available. The experiment, of which a careful assessment isbeing made, is designed to test the value of such a scheme in the training ofhomeless offenders who may already have spent long periods in institutions.The hope is that it may have the result of breaking down still further the barriersbetween holding a young offender in custody and letting him live in the com-munity with support and supervision.BORSTAL AFTER-CARE154. After-care for young men released from borstal was until recently in thehands of the Borstal Division of the Central After-Care Association. As anew development, governors and housemasters now develop their own links with the probation and after-care service, both with the principal probationofficer for the area in which the borstal is situated, and with the officer likely to supervise a boy after release. This development has given greater emphasis tothe fact that after-care is part of the borstal sentence from the time the offenderis committed to custody. The borstal pre-release unit, now a part of the HomeOffice Prison Department, maintains a general oversight of the new arrange-ments.YOUNG PRISONERS155. For some years it has been accepted policy that offenders under 21 shouldnot be sent to prison unless no other alternative appears open to the courts.There are, however, as indicated in the Appendix, about 1,000 of them servingsentences of imprisonment at any one time. Most of them are aged 19 or 20 andhave previously been in a borstal or detention centre, or both. It is also acceptedpolicy that these young offenders should be kept separate from prisoners over 21.It is obviously not easy to provide a range of suitable establishments and regimesfor this particular group, but it must be admitted that until recently youngprisoners have been towards the end of the queue in the allocation of available resources.156. Young offenders sentenced to periods of imprisonment of less than sixmonths have to remain in local prisons, where often very little can be done forthem. (Recently one or two local prisons in each region have, however, beenable to provide a self-contained unit for young prisoners.) Those sentenced tolonger periods of imprisonment go to one of four young prisoner centres. two are self-contained establishments at Aylesbury and Northallerton, and two arein separate wings of the adult prisons at Liverpool and Stafford. There have not
been enough places in these centres, with the result that some young prisonershave had to wait for too long in local prisons before transfer. The Governmenthas recently decided to provide a further 100 places at Aylesbury by closingthe detention centre there and by using the buildings as an extension of theadjacent young prisoners centre. This will enable more of those sentenced to imprisonment to receive better training, with adequate work and provision for physical and other education, for a longer period of their sentence. Some youngprisoners are serving very long terms for very serious offences; 50 of them are serving life sentences4&apos;. A handful are Category &quot;A&quot; prisoners for whom adequatesecurity must be provided. All young prisoners are reclassified as adults at about the age of 21 and transferred to adult training prisons if they still have asubstantial period left to serve, although the exact time of transfer is adjusted tomeet an offenders degree of maturity and the plans for his training.THE PRESENT SITUATION157. Three forms of custodial treatment of young offenders have now been described: detention centres for sentences of between 3 and 6 months; borstal,where the period in custody ranges from 6 months to 2 years and depends on theoffenders response to training; and imprisonment, normally for sentences of6 months or less or of 3 years or more. Young offenders sentenced to imprison-ment for over 18 months are eligible for consideration for parole, but in anycase all young offenders on release from custody are liable to supervision forthe full remaining period of the sentence.158. There are powers in the Criminal Justice Act 1961 to remove altogether from the courts the power to sentence young offenders to short-term imprison-ment once sufficient places become available in detention centres. These powers have not yet been implemented and although only a relatively small number of young offenders are sent to prison for short periods it is not certain that all ofthem could appropriately be dealt with in the present detention centres. Theoperation of detention centres is now under review by the sub-committee of theAdvisory Council on the Penal System referred to in paragraph, 150. Anothersub-committee of the Council is examining the possibility of new forms ofnon-custodial and semi-custodial treatment for both young offenders and adults.159. The borstal system is now more than 60 years old. Many changes havebeen made in its training methods to adapt them to modern social conditions andto the type of offender being received. (The effect of current legislation is thatthe sentence of borstal training is now passed on virtually all young offendersfor whom the court feels a period of custody of between six months and twoyears is appropriate.) A good deal of borstal training takes place within a generalframework devised between the wars, and the Government^ view is that thereshould be a fundamental review of the system.This includes some sentenced to &quot;detention during Her Majesty&apos;s Pleasure&quot;.
THE CHANGING BACKGROUND160. Changing social conditions and changes in the type and character of young people now being received into custody have challenged many of the basic concepts on which the regimes in young offender institutions have been based. Young people grow up more quickly than they used to. Many of theyoung men now received into custody are married and many have children.Changes in the age of physical and mental maturation have been reflected in thedecision to reduce the age of majority to 18. Although the Latey Committee, onwhose recommendation the change was made, excluded the criminal and penalfield from their recommendations, the formal change and the context in whichit was made must have implications for the treatment of young offenders.A NEW REVIEW161. The Government&apos;s White Paper &quot;Children in Trouble&quot; and the legislation which followed provide a new pattern of jurisdiction and treatment for young offenders under 17. The Government has announced that it would now be appropriate to undertake a comprehensive review of the custodial treatment ofall young offenders above that age. The review will be conducted by the AdvisoryCouncil on the Penal System and will require time and preparation. preparatory work has begun in the Home Office and the Government hopes that the reviewitself will begin next year. The Government will ensure that in the meantimethere is no inhibition on necessary change and progress for example, in dealingwith detention centres or in considering non-custodial penalties.MALE ADULT PRISONERS162. Information about the 20,000 male adult prisoners in custody at any onetime is given in the Appendix. Almost half are serving sentences up to and includ-ing eighteen months. Almost a quarter are serving sentences of over three years.These 20,000 prisoners are contained in nearly sixty different prisons, of whicha list is given on page 00. The basis of the system is still the local prison to whichprisoners go direct from the courts and in which more than half the adult maleprisoners are held, often sleeping two or three in a cell, in buildings which all are agreed are obsolete. The local prison is overcrowded and it is trying to perfonntoo many functions.LOCAL PRISONS163. The first responsibility of any local prison is to the courts. The first priority in the deployment of its staff is in the reception of prisoners from court and despatch to court, in escorting prisoners to and from the higher courts and in ensuring their security. This work is fluctuating in its demands, and workshops in many local prisons sometimes have to close for lack of staff ondays on which the demands of court work are high. In addition to men waiting to appear in court, local prisons hold civil prisoners, long sentence prisonerstemporarily sent back to a local prison to receive visits from their families,young men awaiting vacancies in borstal allocation centres or young prisonercentres, and large numbers of men sentenced to terms of imprisonment for whom vacancies cannot yet be found in training prisons.
164. Yet, for all their manifest disadvantages, local prisons have one great advantage. Most of them are in the right places to perform their trial-and-remand function. They are near some of the courts they serve; they have readyaccess to outside medical and other specialist services; because communications are good it is possible for solicitors, probation officers, and others to visitprisoners on remand and after trial, and families do not have to make longjourneys for visits. Staff can be recruited, including specialist staff of various kinds. In recent years separate remand centres for people under 21 have been built. As indicated in paragraph 147 they have many advantages, but experience has shown the extreme difficulty of getting sites in the right places with goodcommunications.165. The Government, after re-examining the role of the local prison, hasevolved new plans for a major, though gradual, shift of policy. It has decidedthat the local prison should retain its traditional trial-and-remand function foradult male prisoners. It has also decided that the role of the local prison should in future include certain other functions which are either closely associatedwith the trial-and-remand function or require the services of the same specialiststaff. These are:(a) allocation and categorisation of convicted prisoners;(6) medical examination and treatment; and, at least in some cases,(c) pre-release arrangements for long sentence prisoners.A NEW DESIGN166. All this does not mean that the functions of the local prison can be satisfactorily carried out in the existing Victorian buildings. There are plans forthe gradual modernisation and redevelopment of old buildings as described inparagraphs 183-186, but, in addition, the Government has set in train a full-scalestudy of the design of a local prison. This will be carried out by the PenalEstablishments Group of the Ministry of Public Building and Works. TheGroup works in close association with the Home Office and the governor of a prison has been seconded full-time to it. This is the first study of its kind to be devoted to the special design problems of a local prison and will include an analysis of what would be involved in the complete redevelopment of one ofour Victorian prisons. The recommendations of the Royal Commission onAssizes and Quarter Sessions&quot; will also be considered in planning the localprison of the future.CLASSIFICATION167. The Government decided a few years ago to set up regional allocationcentres in the local prisons at Liverpool, Birmingham, Wandsworth and Bristol.All men sentenced to long periods of imprisonment are now sent to one of thesecentres for a period of assessment after conviction. In addition, observation andclassification units have now been established in all local prisons for the assess-ment of men serving other sentences of 3 months or more. Thus, for the first*Cmnd. 4153 (1969).
time, a proper assessment can be made of the great majority of men sentenced to imprisonment. The assessment process has four aims:(a) to obtain and record certain basic information about each prisoner,and about his family background;(b) to attempt to identify his needs and, if possible, the factors that mayhave led to his criminal behaviour as an essential to any attempt todeal with them while he is in custody;(c) to settle his &quot;security&quot; category (see paragraph 168 below);(c/) in the light of these factors, and of the resources available in the region,to recommend where he should serve the whole or the first part of hissentence.SECURITY CATEGORIES168.   Prisoners are now placed in one of the following categories.Category A. Prisoners whose escape would be highly dangerous to thepublic or the police or to the security of the state.Category B. Prisoners for whom the very highest conditions of securityare not necessary but for whom escape must be made verydifficult.Category C. Prisoners who cannot be trusted in open conditions but who do not have the ability or resources to make a determinedescape attempt.Category D. Those who can reasonably be trusted to serve their sentencesin open conditions.169. The categorisation arrangements were introduced in 1967 on the recom-mendation of Lord Mountbatten, after his inquiry for the Home Secretary intoa number of prison escapes. Obviously there arc no clear cut lines to be drawn between prisoners placed in one category and those placed in another. Also aprisoners security category may be changed during his sentence. The experienceso far gained suggests that the prison service should plan on the basis that about1 per cent of the convicted prisoners in custody will be in Category A, about 30per cent in Category B, about 50 per cent in Category C, and 20 per cent in Cate-gory D. One important qualification has however to be made to the definition ofa Category D prisoner. Local people feel understandably alarmed at the prospectof an open prison being built in their neighbourhood, even though once the prison has become accepted the alarm generally disappears. At the planningstage the Department is often asked to give pledges that no prisoner convicted of offences involving sex or violence will be sent to a particular open prison,even though experience suggests that some of these offenders could be transferredwithout risk after a period of observation in a local prison.TRAINING PRISONS170. In a training prison there is little worry about the court and escort work that makes continuity of training and of staff influence so difficult in a busyPR c*
local prison. The great majority of convicted prisoners, apart from those servingvery short sentences, ought to be in training prisons; and one of the unsatis-factory features of the present situation is that men serving up to four years&apos;imprisonment may serve all their sentence in an overcrowded local prison. the prison Department divide the country into four regions, and most prisoners wholeave local prisons are transferred to training prisons within their own region.It was decided in 1966 to do this also with long-term recidivist prisoners (i.e.those who had served previous sentences). In the past men from the North andthe Midlands have had to serve long sentences at Parkhurst and Dartmoor,which, though ironically known as &quot;central&quot; prisons, could hardly have been further from their homes. It is hoped that within two or three years it will beunusual for a recidivist prisoner not in the highest security category to be allo-cated to a prison outside his region. One of the reasons why this has become possible is that the Criminal Justice Act 1967 abolished the special sentences ofcorrective training and preventive detention. It is no longer necessary to set aside some closed prisons, or parts of them, for recidivists serving these sentences,whose needs and characteristics were often indistinguishable from those of mensentenced to ordinary imprisonment.VARIATION IN REGIME171. Ideally all convicted prisoners would be sent to training prisons with aregime suited to their needs, and with a degree of security no greater than wasnecessary. We are very far from this ideal, but here too a start has been made for example in differentiating the functions of particular institutions. The newprison at Coldingley mentioned in paragraph 56, whose predominant featurewill be its industry, will aim to train the prisoner in an industrial environment.This type of industrial regime may well prove to benefit considerable numbersof medium and long-term prisoners, but it is not designed to cater for the moredisturbed prisoner. In addition to the special regime at the psychiatric prison atGrendon there are other prisons at which facilities are being developed for thetreatment of disturbed prisoners. At one or two prisons there will be opportunities for education or specialised vocational training which it is not economic orpracticable to make generally available.CATEGORY C PRISONS172. The measures in the Criminal Justice Act 1967 designed to keep men outof prison altogether led, at least temporarily, to a fall in the number of mensuitable under present criteria for open prisons. There is no immediate need forthe provision of more open prisons although more men sentenced to longersentences should have the opportunity to spend part of their sentence in an openprison within their own region. There is however an urgent need for moretraining prisons for Category C prisoners (i.e. men not suitable for open prisonsbut unlikely to be &quot;escape risks&quot;). The Government plans to provide newCategory C prisons for men serving sentences of up to 18 months. The openingof such prisons would relieve the pressure on local prisons, give convictedoffenders much better facilities for work, education and recreation than are possible in overcrowded local prisons, and leave other closed training prisons to tackle the particularly difficult problems of prisoners serving longer sentences.
173. The new Category C prisons will have an effective perimeter fence, but will not have the elaborate security precautions of a Category B prison. Prisonerswill sleep in cubicles and not in secure cells, and there will be a degree of freedomof movement during the day. The Government believes that, within a secureperimeter, it will be possible to reproduce for these prisoners many of the provedadvantages of the existing open prisons.CATEGORY A PRISONERS174. Only about 1 per cent of all convicted adult male prisoners, and a handfulof women and young prisoners, are currently placed in the highest securitycategory: those whose escape would be highly dangerous to the police or thepublic or to the security of the State. Almost all convicted Category A prisonersare serving sentences of ten years and over, and about 40 per cent are serving lifesentences. They are not a homogeneous group in other respects. They include-one or two spies, and a considerable number of professional criminals, most withviolent records, some of whom have associates outside who might be willing tohelp them escape. About one third are dangerous sexual offenders whose escapewould endanger the public but who may present no particular threat while in custody. The security category of all Category A prisoners is regularly reviewed,and experience shows that it is safe to downgrade a number of them to CategoryB in the course of a long sentence.SECURITY WINGS175. To meet the new threats to security referred to in paragraph 199 theGovernment found it necessary to maintain small &quot;special security wings&quot; in parts of the existing prisons at Parkhurst, Durham, Leicester and Chelmsford.A secure wing at Brixton is used to hold Category A men awaiting trial. Condi-tions in these wings, and the adjacent exercise areas, have been much improvedsince they were opened, but it remains undesirable that men should be detained for very long periods in such confined conditions.DISPERSAL176. The containment of Category A prisoners poses difficult problems forthe prison service and indeed for the community. They were fully discussed inthe 1968 Report of the Advisory Council on the Penal System &quot;The Regimefor Long Term Prisoners in Conditions of Maximum Security&quot;. The Councilaccepted that the concentration of all Category A prisoners into one or two small maximum security prisons would make it easier to provide &quot;near-absolutesecurity&quot; for them. They were concerned, however, that the atmosphere of suchinstitutions containing a concentration of evil and dangerous men might becomerepressive and that the maintenance of good order would be very difficult ifprisoners could not be transferred between a number of equally secure prisons,either to split up associates or to separate enemies. They recommended insteadthat Category A prisoners should be dispersed among the population of a small number of secure establishments.177.   The Government thought that, on balance, this policy of dispersal was to
be preferred to one of concentration, and decided not to build Alvington-theproposed maximum security prison for 120 prisoners on the Isle of Wight.Instead, work was pressed forward to strengthen the security, especially the perimeter security, of a number of long-term prisons, and this entailed the moresecure containment of a considerable number of Category B prisoners as wellas those in Category A. Apart from those in the special security wings, recidivistprisoners in Category A are now held at Gartree in the Midlands, at Hull in theNorth, and at Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight. It is proposed to send others toAlbany, next door to Parkhurst, and to the new prison at Long Lartin, inWorcestershire, which should open in 1971. Prisoners in Category A without serious previous criminal records may be allocated to Wakefield or WormwoodScrubs.178. In accordance with another recommendation of the Advisory Council,a small segregation unit is to form part of each of these dispersal prisons. Thepower to send a disruptive or violent prisoner for a period to the segregationunit is one that safeguards the regime of the prison for the majority of its population, and will assist governors to deal with the small minority of prisoners,whether in Category A or Category B, who appear determined to stir up troubleand to incite others to do the same. The dispersal policy will also give flexibility in the transfer of such prisoners between establishments. It is still necessary tohold a minority of Category A prisoners in the special security wings. Thepopulation of those wings has, however, been substantially reduced from 62in April 1967 to about 45 and they will be kept under review as experience ofthe dispersal policy is gained.THE CAREER OF THE PRISONER179. Paragraph 167 described the initial assessment and allocation of a prisoner.Assessment must be a continuing process, and allocation needs to be reviewed.Some prisoners will be transferred to take a vocational training course. Somewho are in closed prisons at the beginning of a sentence can, and thereforeshould, be trusted in an open prison towards the end of it. Also, as indicated inparagraph 98, those sentenced to four years&apos; imprisonment and over can spend the last part of their sentence working outside the prison for a private employer.The arrangements for planning what may be called the &quot;career&quot; of a prisonerserving a long sentence have not in the past been satisfactory. Therefore, along-side the new arrangements for the initial assessment and documentation ofconvicted prisoners serving long sentences, the Government has introducedbetter methods for the review of a prisoners situation and progress at regular intervals during sentence.180. The introduction of parole has, however, introduced a new complicationinto the pre-release employment scheme. The stages in a prisoners career oughtto be related to his likely date of release. That date may now be brought forward by release on parole but those in the prison charged with the duty of looking after the long sentence prisoner cannot know in advance whether he will be selected for parole or not. Arrangements already exist under which the ParoleBoard may fix the release of a long sentence prisoner several months ahead and
indicate that they feel he should first spend a period on a pre-release employmentscheme. Further study is needed of other ways in which the Prison department and the Parole Board can co-operate in the planning of the career of a longsentence prisoner with a view to his release to supervision in the communityafter training in custody; and they must be ways which do not cast doubt onthe responsibilities of the Prison Department or on the statutory independence of the Parole Board.EXISTING BUILDINGS181. Of the 46 closed prisons in which male adult prisoners were held on 1stJuly 1969, only 5 have been built as prisons since 1914. As the list of existingestablishments given in the note on page 00 shows, our old buildings also houses considerable number of young offenders. The prison service is not alone in-having to work with outdated capital assets. But it is particularly handicapped bythe fact that not one closed prison or borstal was built in the 40 years 1918-1958,so that the proportion of obsolete buildings is unusually high.182. Many people concerned with the prison system have said, or been tempted to say, that the only thing to do with our Victorian inheritance is to pull it down.But even assuming, and it is a very big assumption, that suitable sites could befound for modern buildings to replace them, the provision of 20,000 new places in secure prisons and borstals in modern buildings would cost something over 100 million. The prison service needs new buildings and they are being planned.(See paragraphs 190-192 below.) But we have to face the fact that the resources to replace all unsuitable buildings are simply not available, and that the service will enter the last quarter of the twentieth century with buildings designed in the nineteenth. The need, therefore, is to make the best use of them and see how theycan be improved.RENOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT183. First, it is necessary to ensure that the services of our old buildings donot break down. There is a real risk of this happening, since in many of them the heating systems, drains, and power supplies are reaching, or have reached,the end of their useful life or are inadequate for modern needs. The Governmenthas embarked on a major programme for renewal of these services, includingnew boiler houses, at a cost of between    and    million a year over the nextfew years. An important part of this programme is the increase of power supplies to enable modern industrial machinery to be used and lighting to be improved.Second, on some sites there is space available on which new workshops can beadded to or substituted for old, and a programme designed to do that will cost over    million a year in the next few years.REFURBISHING PROGRAMME184. Quite minor improvements can alleviate the harsh and drab appearance of much of our old accommodation. Since the war, for example, the floors of manyprisons and borstals have been covered with new coloured tiles. The Government
thinks that such relatively minor improvements are of great importance. a systematic programme has been drawn up to give new impetus to such work,which will be done, as far as possible, by prisoners themselves under the directionof works staff. The programme will start this financial year and in the first phase30 prisons, mostly dating from the last century, will be redecorated. The workwill include substantial retiling of floors and the cost will be of the order of  lm.Similar redecoration will later be carried out at an additional 46, mainly hutted,establishments at a cost of about  -J-m. It is also proposed, as the programmeproceeds, to replace old cell furniture with up to date patterns.&quot;SLOPPING OUT&quot;185. All new prisons are being designed to avoid the need for &quot;slopping out&quot;.Experiments in the automatic unlocking of cells may provide the means ofsolving the problem of night sanitation in existing prisons, although the systemso far examined would cost a great deal to install. But if there is no early prospectof getting rid of slopping out in most of our closed prisons it is possible toimprove their sanitary facilities. At 8 Victorian prisons  lm. is to be spent toprovide more showers, toilets, and wash basins, and on improvements in lightingand ventilation. This scheme has had to be restricted, initially at least, to 8prisons, partly because the cost is high, partly because it entails reducing the places available by giving up cells to make room for the additional showers andlavatories. While this carries with it some risk, particularly at a time when thecurrent rise in the prison population is expected to continue, the government believes that it is a risk that should be taken because of the general improvementthat will result and to point a way for similar work, perhaps on an enlargedscale, in the years ahead. Another experiment which could provide a prototypefor the future, if it is successful, is the complete reconstruction of a cell blockwhich was badly damaged by fire. This reconstruction includes flooring in someof the &quot;well&quot; of the block to provide badly needed association or recreationareas. Some parts of the programme described above, including the redecorationof 30 Victorian prisons, will be completed within the next 2 years and the whole&quot;refurbishing programme&quot; should be complete within 5 years.REDEVELOPMENT186. There are plans for the comprehensive redevelopment of a number of establishments. Priority will have to be given to closed prisons where the need is greatest, but comprehensive redevelopment will not be confined to closedprisons. Many of the open prisons and borstals are in hutted accommodation which is reaching, or in some cases has reached, the end of its economic life, andthe Government plans the gradual redevelopment of such establishments on existing sites. The following is a list of establishments at which major building work is already proceeding, or in which new units or rebuilding will, it is hoped,start in the next five years, although in some cases plans are in their early stages.
t At these establishments the greater part of the work is being or will be done by the prisonersor young offenders themselves.LiverpoolMaidstoneNottingham!Portsmoutht (already started)Readingf (already started)SudburyfSwanseafThorp ArchThe Vernef (already started)Winchester!Wormwood ScrubsLatchmere HouseMorton HallNew HallUsk (Prescoed)tWetherbyfAdult establishmentsAppleton Thorn jAshwellf (already started)BrixtonBristolEastchnrchfFordfGloucesterLeedsLeicesterLewes (major improvementsbeing made after fire)LincolnYoung Offenders EstablishmentsDover (already started)Gringley Campt (already started)HatfieldHollesley Bay Colonyf(already started)NEW BUILDINGSSITES187. The present gross overcrowding in local prisons, and the resumed rise inthe total number of offenders in custody, would alone point the need to a continuing programme of new buildings. The first task is to find sites. If suitablealternative sites could be found it would be possible, for example, to considerreplacing the worst of the Victorian prisons now occupying central sites inLondon and other large cities. But new sites in towns are unlikely to become available and would be very expensive; and the proposal to build a new prisonin any town would encounter strong opposition. The building of a new institution,and the housing for its staff, on open land within easy reach of a large centre of population perhaps the best solution has to meet formidable planning objec-tions. A site in a more remote or barren area may isolate the institution, its staff, and the families of its staff, from the community. Not only is accessdifficult for the families and friends of offenders, and for probation officers,medical consultants and other visitors, but it may become impossible to recruitand retain all the necessary staff, both full-time and part-time. There are very real staffing difficulties at some of the institutions built since the war in rural areas. Many of these difficulties are not unique to the prison service they apply to other services maintaining residential institutions of one kind or another; but there is, perhaps, an added difficulty in the alarm often expressed bylocal residents at the suggestion that a prison should be built in their midst.
188. It is not, therefore, surprising that a good deal of staff effort has to be devoted to finding suitable sites. It has been Government policy that, so far aspossible, new institutions should be built on land already in public ownershipbecoming redundant to the needs of other Government departments. TheHome Office, like all other departments, consults planning authorities aboutthe development of new buildings and where there is local objection a public inquiry may be held. It is right that these procedures should be followed andthe interests of all those affected adequately considered. But the inevitable result is that the process of acquiring sites and developing them takes a long timeand involves much work that in the end may prove abortive. It can take seven years or more from the time that the Department provisionally selects a siteto the time when the new building is opened. In those seven years the demands on the prison service will have increased. It is hoped that better organisation ofthe Department will reduce unnecessary delays but the process will always take several years.189. There is always a danger that a large institution will become authoritarianand impersonal in its attitudes and organisation, and, partly for this reason, thetendency since the war has been to plan and build smaller institutions than in the nineteenth century. But the same objections may not apply if two or three units are grouped into one complex, and if this is done there is scope for economy inthe provision of common services, such as boiler houses and administrativeoffices, as well as the advantage of making more intensive use of a site. This is why the Prison Department is likely in future to resort to this practice and build rather larger institutions.NEW ESTABLISHMENTS FOR ADULTS190. Paragraph 172 explained why the Government intends to give high priority to new prisons for Category C prisoners those not thought suitablefor open prisons but not likely escapers. The first of these are now being provided in camps at Haverigg, in Cumberland, and at Northeye, near Bexhill in Sussex;but design work is now beginning on purpose-built Category C prisons. these may hold up to 200 prisoners in each of four units, or 750-800 in each prison;and it is hoped that the construction of six such prisons, built so far as possibleto a standard design, may start within the next five years. Among the sites beingconsidered are Full Sutton and Ulnes Walton, in the North Region, Gartreein the Midland Region, and Wrabness in the South East.191. There is also an urgent need for more accommodation for prisoners of ahigher security category. The training prison to hold about 300 Category Bprisoners opened this year at Coldingley, in Surrey, has already been mentioned.A training prison for about 500 is being built at Long Lartin in Worcestershire,and should be open in 1971. Design work is now well advanced on a prison inOxfordshire to be known as Lockwood prison. This will have two sections: thefirst section will be a training prison for about 300 prisoners; the other, a localprison for 200 will enable the small and obsolete prison at Oxford to be closed,thus fulfilling a long outstanding commitment. There are plans for an importantclosed prison in the North Region on which building work should start by the

Design work is now well advanced on a prison inOxfordshire to be known as Lockwood prison. This will have two sections: thefirst section will be a training prison for about 300 prisoners; the other, a localprison for 200 will enable the small and obsolete prison at Oxford to be closed,thus fulfilling a long outstanding commitment. There are plans for an importantclosed prison in the North Region on which building work should start by the

In the last two years, the houses provided by government building have been supplemented by purchase from private owners or builders,and as a result of these special efforts about 650 quarters were built or acquiredin 1968. The number of officers waiting for quarters at the end of the year was less than 250.GENERAL194. The Ministry of Public Building and Works handles most major newprison projects. Other work, including work within existing prisons or borstals(where security considerations are likely to arise), is carried out by the PrisonDepartment. On its works side, as with prison industries, the Department hasbeen under-managed, and an expanding building programme requires morestaff to control it effectively. The whole programme, including that for which theMinistry of Public Building and Works is responsible, is now being planned on abasis of annual &quot;starts&quot; for each of the ensuing five years.195. The following diagram shows the total of capital expenditure since 1960,including that on quarters and on physical security, and estimates of expenditureup to 1971/72 (the figure shown for 1971/72 is a provisional estimate).

The aim is to providereasonable working conditions for prison stall&apos;, and. reasonable living and.working conditions for offenders. Modern materials bring long-term economic advantages and modern techniques are being used. The installation of automaticlocking systems, for example, can lead to economies in stall&apos;as well as helpinglo banish from new establishments the degrading practice of &quot;slopping-out&quot;.New buildings can provide belter standards for all who use them.SECLJRrrY197. In October 1966, following the escape of George Blake from WormwoodScrubs, Lord Mountbattcn was appointed lo conduct an Inquiry &quot;into recentprison escapes . . .&quot; and to make recommendations for the improvement of
prison security. In his Report, published in December 1966 (Cmnd. 3175), he made a series of far-reaching recommendations to improve prison security andthese, accepted by the Government, have been progressively put into etfect inthe last three years. As the following diagram shows, the number of escapes fromclosed prisons and remand centres has been reduced to a quarter of those forearlier years.Escapes from closed prisons and remand centres19G2196319641965196619671968CLOSED PRISONS	REMAND CENTRES45	1159	1277	1663	1668	1718	510	11Total escapes19621968SECURITY WEAKNESSES198. There were various reasons why security in closed prisons had fallenbelow an acceptable level. The deterioration of the fabric of old buildings wasone reason. Another was the freer movement and association of prisoners inbuildings that might have remained secure if used for their original purpose of
solitary confinement. Moreover, the post-war training prisons, such as Blundes-lon, had been designed on the assumption that the buildings themselves couldbe made so secure that a fence sufficient to hinder rather than to prevent escapescould replace the traditional perimeter wall. This assumption, and the buildingsdesigned on il, have both had to be modified.THE NEW THREAT199. In addition, the prison service had been slow to react to a change in thenature of the threat it had to meet. Some escapes are made on impulse, some arethe result of careful planning inside the prison, some reflect careful planningwith associates outside. The longer a man&apos;s sentence, the more IiRely it is thathe will plan to cscape*. Since the greater the resources a prisoner can commandoutside both in terms of money and influence the more likely he is to receiveassistance in securing his escape, the emergence of large-scale organised crimeis directly relevant to prison security. It is very difficult to judge how manyprisoners in custody might, with such outside assistance, be able to engineer anattempted escape. But there are undoubtedly some and their safe keeping raisesspecial problems. Finally although in the past very few prisoners serving lifesentences have escaped, or attempted, to do so, a new factor has been introduced by the abolition of capital punishment and the consequent detention for very long periods of some prisoners who might previously have been executed.THE NEW DEFENCES200. The procedure by which prisoners are now placed in &quot;security categories&quot;was described in paragraph 168. It has necessitated, as its chief aim, strengthenedsecurity at the prisons holding men in categories A and B. First, the conventionalbarriers of bars and walls have been improved. New bars have been filled tomany windows and the structure of cells and other buildings has been strength-ened. The erection of additional inner fences has greatly strengthened perimetersecurity at 17 prisons. Double fences will provide the basic perimeter securityof new category B prisons. (The Government has rejected the suggestion that security should, be maintained, by the use of armed, guards on the perimeter.)Second, the Prison Department; is making increasing use of modern technicalequipment and has benefited from expert scientific advice. (The Prison Depart-ment is now advised on prison security by a high level Advisory Group of scientists.) The new equipment already in use includes better lighting, closedcircuit TV, personal wireless sets for staff and various alarm devices lilted on or near perimeter boundaries. The programme of improved, physical security andof new equipment is not yet complete but it has already done a great deal toraise standards.201. More stall have been employed on security duties. New wall patrols andmore staff on duty on the perimeter are merely the obvious additions. Theremust also be staff in control rooms and in the operation of security equipment.*In the years 1961 1966 about 20% of cscapers, ignoring those on remand, came from abouj2% of the prison population: those serving determinate sentences of ten years or more. Thincrease in the number of very long sentences has been described in the note on page 00. e
Training courses have been held, including those for the security officers appointed-ted at all closed prisons. The basic aim of training in security duties, as inother spheres, is to make the stall&apos;more professional in carrying out their tasks,for the best of security devices depends entirely on the training and alertness ofthe staff who operate and use them. Lord Mounlbatten recommended thatprison officers should be trained as dog handlers and provided with their owndogs. Thanks to the co-operation and ready help of the police, a prison dogservice has been trained and built up, and it will soon reach the planned comple-ment of 210 dog handlers for patrol duties at 24 closed prisons. Dogs are neverused to assist in the routine escorting of prisoners within a prison. They arc a deterrent to escape attempts, including attempts to breach the perimeter of a prison from outside. An important clement in increased security effectivenesshas been the growth of co-operation between the prison service and the police,including the provision by the police of up-to-date information as to a prisonersknown criminal associates at large.THE COST OF SECURITY202. In general the aim has been to concentrate the new security measures onthe perimeters of closed prisons, which means that greater security docs not involve the placing of greater restrictions on the activities and movement ofprisoners. Indeed, in the long run, a strengthening of perimeter security should enable some of the restrictions imposed, on security grounds within closed prisonsto be relaxed. Greater security can be obtained without serious detriment to thetreatment of prisoners. It cannot however be obtained without the expenditureof a lot of time and money. When resources arc limited, difficult decisions mustbe taken about the relative priority of expenditure on security measures andexpenditure on new building and other necessary prison improvements.NOTELIST OF PRISON SERVICE establishments in USE ON 1st JULY 1969Local Prisons for MenNameBedfordBirminghamBristol . .CertifiedNormalA accommodation*167527407Date first usedfor custody of offenders184818451883Purpose for which builtCounty GaolCity GaolBuilt by Prison Commis-sion.

VIISTAFF AND ORGANISATIONGENERAL203. There are about 15,000 public servants working in the prison service.Their wages and salaries in the last financial year amounted to about  24m.,something over half the total cost of the prison system. Like any other service organisation dealing with people the prison system is, therefore, &quot;labourintensive&quot; and it is important that staff should be of the right quality, welltrained and efficiently used. This Part gives some account of the work andtraining of the many different types of people employed by the service andemphasises in particular the role of the modern prison officer. It also deals withthe organisation of the service, both at headquarters and in institutions, anddiscusses some of the decisions that have to be made about the best use of the human resources available.204. The following table shows the main groups of staff and the type ofinstitutions at which they work:

INCREASE IN STAFF205. The following table shows how the total number of staff has increased since 1964:	Average prison Population	Total Prison Officer grades in post at end of year	Total staff in post at end of year1964 ..	29,600	8,109	11,7701965 ..	30,421	8,261	12,0421966 ..	33,086	8,909	12,8831967 ..	35,009	9,532	13,8101968 ..	32,461	10,202	14,7921st July 1969 ..	34,782	10,607	15,245Various factors in the past few years have made it necessary to increase the staff.They include the increase in the numbers of offenders in custody, the opening ofnew establishments, usually smaller than those of a previous age, and requiringa greater ratio of staff to offenders, new security and escort duties, the develop-ment of new activities and new methods of treatment and the decision to allowoffenders more time out of their cells. The Prison Department must always be seeking ways to use staff more economically but, in general, improvements in the prison system entail additional staff, although in some cases (e.g. automaticlocking systems) they should lead to economies.GOVERNORS AND ASSISTANT GOVERNORS206. The governor of a prison is responsible for the maintenance of security,good order and discipline, for the effective co-ordination of the work of all themembers of his staff, for the regime of the establishment and the treatment andtraining of offenders, and for the proper use of public money and property. Thisis a formidable assignment. It requires qualities of leadership and management,allied to a continuing concern for individuals. Assistant governors have mana-gerial and administrative responsibilities for certain parts of an establishment,or certain aspects of its work, or for the devising and implementation of themethods of training offenders. They play a large part in assessing the suitability of offenders for parole, and in selection for home leave or pre-release employ-ment schemes.
RECRUITMENT OF GOVERNORS207. There are about 400 governors and assistant governors. They are at presentrecruited in three ways:(a) by an annual limited competition open only to serving members of the prison officer class;(b) by the promotion of chief officers;(c) by open competition.Some prison officers, and occasionally other members of the prison service,enter the Governor class by open competition, but, in the main, successfulcandidates in the competition have come from outside the service, some direct from Universities, others after experience in a wide variety of occupations. Thefollowing table gives the details of recruitment in the last five years:	Limited					competition	Promotion	Open competition		Total from	(prison	(chief	(open to those in	Total	prison	officers	officers)	and outside the		officer	only)		Service)*		class1964	5	1	16   (0)	22	6  (27%)1965	6	1	19   (4)	26	11   (42%)1966	10	1	15   (1)	26	12  (46%)1967	10	1	39   (4)	50	15   (30%)1968	13	2	39   (7)	54	22  (41%)208. 151 serving governors have come from within the service and, as the table shows, the number of such governors has risen over the years. But demand has risen also and, while it has been the aim of successive governments since 1948 to recruit as far as possible from within the service, progress in this direction hasbeen slow. The Government is convinced that there is much untapped talentwithin the service and that faster progress towards a unified service would bebeneficial. A working party of departmental and staff representatives under thechairmanship of the Director General of the Prison Service has been set up toexamine this problem. Its terms of reference are:&quot;(1) To recommend what changes are necessary to secure that over aperiod a one-tier system is introduced into the Prison Service inEngland and Wales and that meanwhile an increasing proportion ofthe vacancies in the governor class is filled from within the prison service; and for this purpose*Figures in brackets indicate the number of serving members of the prison officer class.
(2) to examine:(a) what modifications are needed in the arrangements for the recruit-ment of prison officers, their conditions of entry and opportunities of promotion to assistant governor;(b) what improvements are needed in the facilities available to suitableprison officers wishing to prepare for such promotion; and(c) what steps are needed to remove any circumstances which maydeter officers from seeking such promotion&quot;.THE MEDICAL SERVICEDOCTORS209. The Prison Medical Service is staffed by some 90 full-time medical officersand an equal number of part-time medical officers who are usually also general practitioners in the National Health Service. There are also visiting specialists,including psychotherapists, dentists, surgeons, anaesthetists and venereologists.The Working Party on the Prison Medical Service, which reported in 1964,recommended the establishment of posts in forensic psychiatry jointly betweenthe Home Office and the various regional hospital boards. Four consultant postshave, so far, been created, and further appointments of joint consultants andregistrars will be made as suitable candidates are found.OTHER STAFF210. The medical staff is supported by nursing sisters and hospital officers, andthe service employs its own pharmacists. The nursing sisters are under thedirection of the Nursing Matron-in-Chief and are mainly stationed in establish-ments for women and girls and for boys, but some are also in post at WormwoodScrubs and Grendon. Hospital officers are members of the prison officer class andwhenever possible are recruited from men who are qualified as state registered orenrolled nurses. As the number from this source is inadequate for the needs ofthe service anyone (including any serving officer) who has experience of, or anaptitude for, nursing may apply to be trained as a hospital officer. All potentialofficers must first undergo the normal initial training course for prison officersand obtain some experience of discipline duties. They then attend special training courses, at the end of which they take an examination, success in which qualifiesthem for the Prison Nursing Certificate.PSYCHOLOGISTS211. The Prison Department now employs 60 psychologists and 20 psycho-logical testers, their services being used in a wide variety of ways. When psycho-logists were first appointed to the prison service their role was seen mainly as thediagnostic assessment of prisoners on remand, and some psychologists still do this work in local prisons or remand centres. Others work in allocation centrescontributing to the initial assessment of prisoners received on conviction, andothers in training prisons where the task may be that of assessing change inattitudes and behaviour during sentence. Whatever the area of his work, the
psychologist aims to provide recommendations on which operational decisionsmay be made and to collect data for evaluative research into the effectiveness ofthe system to which.he is contributing. Psychologists have played a considerable part in the development of group counselling at certain establishments to which reference was made in paragraph 43, and they take training and support groupsfor the staff engaged on this work. In his general approach to his work in the prison service, the psychologist aims to assess and understand institutionalprocesses and the ways in which they can affect both prisoners and staff.ADMINISTRATION212. Working under an Administration Officer there is, in effect, a secretariat ineach establishment whose staff are drawn from the general Civil Service executive,clerical and typing classes. As the number of offenders in custody increases sodoes the work of this administrative staff, for example in correspondence withthe courts and the police. New legislation can also add considerably to its work the parole scheme introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1967 made substantialdemands on staff responsible for obtaining, assembling and copying the necessarydocuments. Normally, the administrative staff are not directly involved in thetreatment or supervision of offenders, although there are some areas, for example in the new provisions concerning legal aid, where, in co-operation with prison officers, they do play such a part; but the smooth running of the establishment and the ability to reach informed decisions about the treatment of offendersobviously depend on the efficiency of the administrative machinery.OFFICE ACCOMMODATION213. Staff must be given decent working conditions. Too often, with theincrease in numbers in recent years, the office accommodation-whether forprofessional staff, prison officers or administrative staff is inadequate and over-crowded. Some staff have to work in converted cells, others in temporary accom-modation. There are some establishments where new buildings provide satis-factory working conditions; and part of the modernisation programme of olderbuildings must be devoted to bringing more offices up to this standard.PRISON OFFICERS214. Two thirds of the staff employed in prison service establishments are the prison officers. The general public all too often sees these officers as gaolers, and little more. This picture is false.SPECIALISATION215. Prison officers may be divided into two broad groups: 7,500 carry out thegeneral work of the establishment including, at a local prison, the work at thecourts. The remaining 2,500 have chosen to specialise, at least for part of theircareer. The specialists, in this sense, include the instructors referred to in para-graph 217 below, the hospital officer, catering officer, physical educationinstructor, the dog handlers and the trade assistants and works officers. Thetrade assistant is responsible for carrying out works services (for examplepr-d
maintenance work, plumbing, carpentry, decorating) and for Hie instruction and supervision of offenders engaged on such work. The works officer, is a moresenior officer with general responsibility for this work in an establishment. Newphysical security arrangements and the new impetus to improve the physicalconditions of old buildings, together with the never-ending maintenance work inobsolete buildings, have combined to place a heavy burden on this group ofprison officers in recent years.THE TREATMENT OP OFFENDERS216. Much of the time of the general prison officer is spent on custodial duties,including court and escort work, and recent measures to improve security haveadded considerably to those essential tasks. Hut the prison officer has been encouraged in recent years to become more involved, in the treatment of theoffenders he deals with. A Working Party, which includes representatives of management and stall&quot;, meets regularly to explore areas in which the prison officercan play a more constructive role, and has already made good progress. In manyestablishments an officer now has the responsibility for a group of ollcnderswhom he can get to know and in whose activities he may join. The assessment andrecording of information about offenders, for example in classification pro-ccdures and for parole, provide prison officers with opportunities for new andrewarding work, and often reveal new skills which, with training, are of great value in the modern treatment of offenders.INSTRUCTORS217. Personal influence is often best exercised when working together on a job,and there is probably no section of the staff better placed to influence offendersthan the instructors in the workshops and on the prison farms. There arealtogether some 1,160 instructors, 650 belonging to the prison officer grades.The rest arc civilian instructional officers. While in many workshops discipline isstill maintained by prison officers undertaking general custodial duties, experience shows that in an increasing number of cases security and discipline in the shopscan be left to the instructors themselves. This points to the need, for greatertraining of civilian instructors in the treatment of offenders so that they can make a contribution to the work of their establishment which goes beyond their technical and managerial work. Equally, as the place of industry in the regime ofa prison becomes more important, there is a need for members of the stall&apos;to learn more about the functioning of industry.HIGHER GRADES OF PRISON OFFICERS218. The Chief Officer in each establishment is responsible to the Governor forthe deployment and. efficient use of the prison officers under his control. Underthe Chief Officer are a number of Principal Officers whose main responsibilitiesmay be in one wing or house of an institution and who arc increasingly being given a managerial role. Last year, in accordance with a recommendation of theMountbatten Report, a third grade called. Senior Officer was introduced. So farover 900 basic grade officers, including 100 specialist officers, have been pro-promoted to this new rank.CM
STAFFING NEEDS219. For some years pasl there has been a need for more prison officers. Theirchanging and developing role and the move towards giving them a live day week have added to (he shortage. In the last three years there have also heenadded the heavy security duties already mentioned, and further escort duties.The effect of all this together with the improved classification procedures, theoperation of the parole and legal aid schemes and the extension of eveningassociation for prisoners, has been to produce a serious shortage of trainedofficers.EFFICIENCY220. There arc three ways of meeting this shortage: by economics in the uscofmanpower, by recruitment, and by overtime working. A survey is now beingmade of the utilisation of manpower among prison officer grades in certainestablishments. Another study--also conducted by Home Office management services in co-operation with the prison service has been made of liiTtinge-mcnls for escorting offenders to and from court and from one establishment toanother. There must be other such studies. The prison service, like any other, has its share of hallowed customs and procedures that have outlived llicir usefulness.RECRUITMENT221. Regardless of the fruits of such studies, the recruitment (hive must con-liiuic. This diagram shows the rise in the total number of officers in post in eachyear since 1958. It also shows the planned rale of growth in future years based ona current assessment of stalling requirements and assuming recruitment andwastage continue at about the present rale.Experience has shown that advertising in newspapers is an olleclive way ofobtaining recruits.  180,000 was spent in the financial year 1968/69 on suchadvertisements. In the same year, and. in line with a recommendation in I lie Reportof the Select Committee on Estimates, new recruiting arrangements were broughtinto operation, involving four permanent selection boards able to make immediateoffers of appointment to suitable candidates, subject to satisfactory referencesand. other checks. Formerly the selection was carried out in stages, the finalappointment being made at I ho training school some three months after I herecruit had joined the service.222. The recruitment target for the financial year 1969/70 is 1,150. This allows for a net increase of about 750   which is as many new officers as the service can effectively train and absorb. There may well be a shortage of 750 basicgrade olliccrs at this end of 1970. Allowing for normal wastage and for theopening of new establishments and for new duties already foreseen, it would be unrealistic to think that the stalling of all establishments can be brought to a desirable level for several years.

OVERTIME223. Staff shortages must be made good by overtime. The staffing needs ofinstitutions vary from day to day, for example with the incidence of court workand escorts, and it would be wrong to base permanent staff complements onperiods of peak activity. It will never therefore be possible to abolish overtime inthe prison service entirely. But at present it is a matter of great concern thatprison officers must regularly work overtime (both in the way of additional hours and of rest day working) to an extent which impairs efficiency and may affecthealth and welfare.TRAINING224. The prison service, like other public services, has increasingly come torealise in the last few years that training is not a once-for-all operation at thebeginning of a career. Central training in the service is undertaken at the Wake-field Staff College, with residential accommodation for 110 students, and at twoOfficers&apos; Training Schools, one at Leyhill and one in new premises at Wakefield,which together have over 250 places. A Principal Officer at every prison has parttime responsibilities for training, but the possible amount of formal staff trainingvaries greatly from one establishment to another.PRISON OFFICERS225. Prison Officers have three months&apos; training on joining the service, two ofwhich are spent at a Training School to which they return for a fortnight at theend of their year&apos;s probation. This first year should be planned with trainingvery much in mind although this ideal is rarely attainable in busy short-staffedestablishments. On promotion to Principal Officer or Chief Officer, officersattend courses at the Wakefield Staff College, where the emphasis is on mangage-ment, and there are specialist courses for security officers, for those in charge of pre-release hostels and for others.OTHER STAFF226. The initial training of assistant governors aims to provide the basis onwhich management, custodial and institutional social work skills can be de-developed. The course lasts eight months, part of which is spent working in prisonsor borstals and with the probation and after-care service. There are shortcourses for members of the governor grades and other senior staff at various stages of their career, and there is one for probation officers on appointment asprison welfare officers. The graph below shows the number of students attendingcourses at the Staff College in each academic year since 1962/63.

WIDER EXPERIENCE227. The prison service does not and should not attempt to be self-sufficientin its training programme. The staff are encouraged to attend courses arranged by the extra mural departments of Universities and local Colleges of further education. About 800 attended such part time courses last year. A small numberattend full time courses such as those at the Cambridge Institute of Criminology.There are links with other Universities, particularly at Leeds, where five lecturersalso teach at the Wakefield Staff College. Since prison staff should have the oppor-tunity of getting to know members of other services with common problems, an increasing number of prison officers now spend a few days attached to the localprobation and after-care service or to psychiatric hospitals. Some staff areenabled, under the auspices of the Council of Europe, to study the penal systems of other countries, and the Prison Department is regularly represented at inter-national conferences.228. All this emphasises that training is not to be seen as merely the absorption of knowledge or skill. It is an opportunity for sharing experience and discussingcommon problems. Too little is done at present to bring together in this waypeople of different grades and disciplines within the prison service itself. TheStaff College has organised some small and successful joint conferences, but if itis to do more of this work, and if its staff are to carry out a programme of evalu-ation and research into the aims and effectiveness of training, the College will need new and more suitable premises.THE ORGANISATIONOF THE PRISON DEPARTMENT229. Unlike many of the other civilian services for which central Governmenthas a general responsibility, the prison service is directly administered as part ofa Government Department and not by a local authority or public corporation.This direct Ministerial responsibility reflects the frequent and proper public and parliamentary interest in the treatment of people in custody. It is one indication of this interest that Home Office Ministers in 1968 answered over 100 Parlia-mentary Questions and about 1,500 letters from Members of Parliament on thetreatment of particular offenders in custody, on parole, and on various matters dealt with by the Prison Department. Increasingly the work of that department is linked to that of the Probation and After-Care Department of the Home office as well as to that of the Department of the Office with responsibilities for the criminal law. The prison service also needs to be in close touch with the develop-ment of modern management techniques in the public service.MANAGEMENT REVIEW230. The Government accordingly decided to carry out a wide ranging reviewof the organisation, functions, management and administrative practices of the prison Department. This review was entrusted to a team including members ofthe Home Office and Civil Service Department Management Services and of outside consultants. They obtained and discussed the views of members of the
Department, both at Headquarters and in institutions, and of the Staff associated -ations. There was general agreement that :(a) Too much detailed work was centralised at headquarters.(b) It was necessary to establish clearer lines of authority and responsibilityat headquarters, and between headquarters, regions and the field, andto integrate the work of the administrative and executive classes and ofthe professional advisers.(c) There was inadequate provision for planning the use to be made of available resources, and for assessing the effect and value of changes inthe treatment of offenders in custody. A planning organisation divorced from the heavy pressure of Parliamentary and other day to clay work was needed.(d) Inspection had been too closely linked with executive functions andhad not been sufficiently comprehensive.The Review Team put forward proposals designed to remedy these and otherdeficiencies, proposals which were generally in line with the recommendations ofthe Fulton Committee on the organisation of the Civil Service. Some members ofthe Review Team had been associated with that Committee.THE NEW STRUCTURE231. The Government announced earlier this year the changes it had decided tomake in the management structure of the Prison Department following themanagement review. A Deputy Under Secretary of State was appointed fulltime Director General of the Prison Service, while retaining a responsibility forthe Parole scheme. The day to day work of the Department and the servicebecame the joint responsibility of a Controller (Administration) and a Controller(Operations). The appointment of a Controller of Planning and Developmentgave one person responsibility for the direction and co-ordination of all medium and long-term planning for the service. The Inspector General, freed of executive responsibilities, became head of a new team to carry out a co-ordinated inspection of all aspects of the work of institutions. This team could call on the services of people of different disciplines and different previous experience. A new andsmaller Prisons Board was set up which, subject to the general supervision of thePermanent Under Secretary of State and the direction of Ministers, sharescollectively in the formulation of major policy developments and decisions. TheDirector General is Chairman of the Board, and its five other members are theControllers of Administration, Operations and Planning and Development, the inspector General and the Director of Prison Medical Services.232. Under the new organisation there are no longer senior posts which arc the exclusive preserve of members of the administrative or executive classes of theCivil Service and others which are the preserve of those who have previously beengovernors of prisons or borstals. Nor are the latter seen primarily as advisers.Staff of different backgrounds and experience work as an integrated team. Thefollowing chart gives the main features of the new organisation.

REGIONALISATION233. A regional office of the Prison Department had already been established at manchester. The Government now proposes to develop as rapidly as possible a regional structure in each of the four regions into which the country is dividedfor this purpose (Northern, Midlands, South Eastern and South Western). Thiswill enable a great deal of detailed work and correspondence to be devolved fromthe London offices, and will enable each institution to obtain decisions, advice and assistance from a regional management that does not seem remote from it.The new arrangements, together with the proposed system of regular inspections,should assist in the flow of information throughout the service, making eachinstitution more aware of its particular role in the system, and of the totaldemands on resources that prevent its own particular needs being met as quickly as the governor and his staff would like.MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONS234. In the past, prisons have sometimes changed too radically with a change of governors and although many important improvements in the system have had that origin, decisions about the allocation of resources must be accompanied bythe efficient management of individual institutions. The first need is for a definition of the role of each institution within its region and within the system asa whole. Personal initiative is still needed, and the opportunity to put forwardfresh ideas, but it is important that developments should not be started if there isno reasonable prospect of the resources becoming available to complete them,and that the continuation of experiments should not depend on the enthusiasm ofone or two individuals. The creation of the new planning and development organisation should mean that the future role of each institution in the system is planned more carefully than has been possible in the past, although so long as thesheer pressure of numbers continues unabated there may have to be occasionalchanges in the role of institutions.TRADITION AND CHANGE235. The efficient management of a prison or borstal is not easy. Since the warinstitutions have undertaken new tasks and recruited new grades of staff to perform them. Assistant governors are used in very different ways in differentestablishments, some largely in a managerial role and some largely as caseworkers; and the development of casework has bred a good deal of uncertainty and experimentation concerning the relative responsibilities of the assistantgovernor, the prison welfare officer and others. The variety of tasks to be per-formed makes it the more important that all staff should understand how their particular role in an institution relates to the general regime. Some governorshave recently found it helpful to designate all the senior staff as part of a manage-ment group, with scope for formal and informal means of cosultation betweenthe governor and staff of all ranks. In the future development of the prison service there may well be a need, as Lord Mountbatten pointed out in his Report,for radical changes in the internal organisation of institutions, with moredifferences than at present between one institution and another.
STAPh AND ORGANISATIONCh. VII236. The interests of the staff themselves and of their families, whose life is affected by their hours of work, must never be forgotten. There is an increasingexpectation that all staff will be able to work the five day week that most have atpresent and will have alternate weekends free of duty. Accordingly, since offendersare in custody for 24 hours a day 7 days a week and some staff have always to beon duty, a major problem in the next ten years is going to be the accommodation of all the various activities within staff working hours. It will become more acuteas a greater proportion of prisoners become fully occupied for seven or eight hours a day for five days of the week in productive industry or in building work.Difficult decisions will have to be taken on such questions as whether familyvisits, interviews with prison welfare officers, group work and many other activities should be allowed to cut into the normal working hours or left to befitted into the remainder of the day or weekend. The answer cannot be the sameat all institutions and must depend partly on the role of the institution within thesystem. There are a wide variety of people in custody. We must provide a wide variety of regimes and opportunities for them.
VIIICONCLUSIONNUMBERS AND OVERCROWDING237. Two factors have dominated the history of the prison service ever since thewar. The first is the rise in numbers, and the consequent overcrowding. The second is the development of alternatives to the traditional form of imprisonment.RISE IN NUMBERS238. In 1967 the daily average number of people in custody was the highest everrecorded: 35,000. It fell in 1968 to 32,500. (This was primarily clue to the pro-visions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 summarised on page 000, which were designed to reduce the number of people sent to prison for short periods.) the daily average in the first half of 1969 has been nearly 34,000. On the best evidence available, and taking account of recent crime figures and the likely growth of thetotal population of England and Wales, the Government believes that the prison service must plan on the assumption that the number of people in custody islikely to continue to rise by over 1,000 a year, thus reaching about 40,000 by theearly 1970&apos;s.OVERCROWDING239. There are today about 9,000 prisoners sleeping two or three in a cell.Overcrowding is the worst feature of our prison system, worse even than the oldbuildings in which it takes place, and its effects are seen throughout the system.It is true that it has been found to be possible for men to sleep two or three in acell with surprisingly little friction and with no obvious detriment to health.Some men prefer the company. Others feel the total lack of privacy. But it is not so easy, though it has to be done, to overcrowd men in workshops, to produce more meals from the same kitchens, to give more men baths in old bath houses,or to supervise more visits in the same visiting room. Overcrowding weakenssecurity and makes it more difficult for staff to get to know prisoners. Shortage of places in training prisons means that many men must remain in local prisonsthroughout their sentence. Shortage of places in training borstals means thatyoung offenders have to wait in local prisons, or in allocation centres, for a vacancy. This waiting period is sometimes far too long and makes a deplorablestart to a borstal sentence. With the general pressure on numbers it sometimesseems that the wonder is not that things occasionally go wrong, especially inovercrowded local prisons, but that the system functions as well as it does.
CHANCES INTRADITIONAL FORMS OF IMPRISONMENT240.   The traditional form of imprisonment involved sending people to a building designed largely for solitary confinement, providing the minimumnecessities of life and allowing the minimum contact with the outside world.Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote in The DeviTs Thoughts:&quot;As he went through Cold-Bath Fields he sawA solitary cell;And the Devil was pleased, for it gavehim a hintFor improving his prisons in Hell.&quot;Offenders were kept in prison for a predetermined period and then releasedabruptly to complete freedom. The account given in this While Paper of thevarious aspects of the work of the modern prison service shows how far we have moved from this concept of imprisonment to a more constructive one.DETENTION CENTRES AND BORSTALS241. Most offenders under 21 whom the courts commit to custody for a short period no longer go to prison at all: they arc sentenced instead to a period in a detention centre. The Government has virtually completed a programme for building new detention centres so that this alternative to imprisonment is now available to courts in all parts of the country; and in 1968, for the fust time, thesupply of places was adequate to meet the current demand. The borstal system has long provided an alternative to the traditional forms of imprisonment for young offenders, and it has expanded since the war so that it now provides thenormal method of treatment for those under 21 whom the courts commit tocustody for a period of between six months and two years.OPEN PRISONS242. Another major development since the war has been the use of openprisons for adult prisoners. About 4,000 places have been provided in theseprisons, and the selection of men and women for transfer to them is but oneexample of the increasing importance of assessing individual offenders, and developing a range of different prisons with different degrees of security and with different regimes.243. A beginning, though only a beginning, has been made in providing a wider range of prisons for adult offenders. Prisons such as Wakeficld andMaidstone pioneered the idea of the training prison with a full and constructiveday&apos;s work. Other prisons, notably Blundeston, have concentrated on the rc-habilitation of &quot;inadequate&quot; offenders. At Grendon psychiatric prison importantwork has been done in the treatment of disturbed offenders.THE CHANGE IN ATMOSPHERE244. One must not exaggerate the extent of all these changes. About 40 per cent of all those in custody, and more than half the adult men, are in overcrowded
Ch. VIIIconclusionlocal prisons. Some borstals are in prison buildings. Moreover, the designation ofan institution as a detention centre, a borstal or a training prison does not, of itself, alter the basic condition of custody, the artificiality of the inmate&apos;s life, theboredom or the drab uniformity. On the other hand, even in the Victorianbuildings in which most prisoners still live, there have been preat changes. The lastvestiges of the rule of silence have long since disappeared in the noise of radios inworkshops, and people in custody may now talk freely to each other. So far as the severe limitations of space and shortages of staff allow, offenders in prison, aswell as in borstals and detention centres, now eat meals together and canassociate with each other in the evening. Books, radio, television and news-papers provide some contact with the world outside. Above all, staff of all gradesare now encouraged to get to know offenders and to concern themselves withtheir treatment. All this has produced a change in atmosphere, and in theattitudes of staff and prisoners to each other.WILL PRISONS DISAPPEAR?245. Some people feel that our society ought to be able to do without prisons.The Government hopes that in the years ahead new penalties and new methods oftreatment, and the greater use of existing alternatives to prison, will furtherreduce the proportion of offenders committed to custody. Hopes too thatthere will be further changes designed to break down the old rigid barriersbetween a period of incarceration and a period of complete freedom. There maybe extensions, for example, of the scheme under which long sentence prisonerscan already spend the last six months of a sentence working for an outsideemployer or of the experiment under which young offenders at borstal live in ahostel and go out each day to work. There may be extensions of the Parolescheme and of after-care hostels for inadequate offenders. But no large modernstate has found it possible to dispense with some form of imprisonment. What-ever may be the changes in our penal system in the last third of the twentiethcentury there is no immediate prospect of the prison system withering away.Indeed it is likely that there will be more people in custody in the next few yearsthan ever before. These are unpalatable facts, but they will not be altered by ourwishing they were otherwise.BUILDINGS AND STAFF246. The community has been slow to accept the need for new prisons andborstals, and equally slow to recognise the need to devote resources to theimprovement of existing buildings. There is a vast backlog to be disposed ofbefore the service is within sight of even its more limited aims the elimination ofovercrowding and the provision of currently acceptable living conditions for all those in custody. Indeed the number of those in custody is likely to rise more quickly in the years up to 1972 than the number of new places becoming availablefor them. On the other hand the Government has set in hand a regular and properly planned building programme. The total capital expenditure planned for1970/71 is about  10m. and this figure should increase in future years. equally important, the balance is being adjusted so that a greater proportion of theresources made available to the prison service is devoted to capital expenditure.
The ratio of capital to current expenditure which was only 1: 7 in 1959, will beabout 1: 4 next year and is likely to be higher than 1: 3 in a few years&apos; time.This means that the last third of the twentieth century will be as important aperiod as the middle of the nineteenth century in altering the shape of thebuildings in which and with which the prison service has to work.THE CONTROL OF RESOURCES247. It is not enough simply to ask for more resources to meet increased demands. The more complex the system and the greater the resources devoted toit, the more important it is that the management of the prison system should be efficient. Efficient organisation is not an end in itself, although the taxpayer is entitled to require that his money is well spent and that the service for which hepays will be well administered. Only if the organisation is efficient can the efforts of all members of the prison service be consistently directed to achieving its aims.STAFF248. The most important of the resources available are the 15,000 members ofthe prison service. More than half the money devoted to the prison service eachyear is spent on their wages and salaries. While there are some purely custodialduties in which new equipment and modern techniques, such as automaticlocking, can be of great assistance, the treatment of people in custody must depend on the humanity, skill and training of the staff. The Governments plans for improving the training of staff emphasise the need for training throughout a career, and the importance of training staff of all disciplines to understand their role in the service and how that role relates to that of their colleagues.249. The complement of the prison service has increased by about 1,000 a year in the last few years. The Government plans for a further increase of 1,000 in thecurrent financial year and hopes that this rate of increase can be maintained.STAFF FOR THE TASKS OF THE SERVICE250. The extra staff are needed if the service is to carry out its first task ofdetaining people in custody in currently acceptable conditions. For example, thesecurity duties found necessary to reduce the rate of escape from closed prisonsrequire more staff. It is not currently acceptable to hold large numbers of offendersin solitary confinement, and it requires more staff to supervise men who are in association with each other than it did to supervise them when locked in theircells. Since everything that happens to people in custody must be seen as part oftheir treatment, the additional staff needed when offenders work for longerhours, or have more frequent visits, are contributing also towards the secondtask of the service: the rehabilitation of the offender.251. Staff are also needed for the development of the further education service for those in custody, using modern skills and techniques, and for the continued expansion of medical and psychiatric treatment especially of the disturbed andunstable offender.
EVALUATION252. There is a natural desire to press ahead with all these activities. Bui manymake heavy demands on stall&quot;. Some require skilled and highly trained pro-fessional stafl&quot;, and others a substantial increase in the ratio of stud&apos;to prisonersso as to allow treatment of offenders in small groups. Moreover, many of these methods of treatment have not yet been adequately evaluated, and (heir ellicacyin altering the attitudes and behaviour of offenders after they leave custody isunproven. Not enough is known, for instance, about Ihe effects of long periods of imprisonment and it is hoped that research already in progress will throw morelight not only on the effects of prolonged imprisonment, but also on the develop-mcnt of effective forms of custodial treatment for these men. Although thenumber of such prisoners is still small it is growing and many of tliem arevicious, ruthless and resourceful, so that Ihey impose a totally disproportionatestrain on the human and material resources of the prison service. One of the most difficult problems in any service is to know how far to assign resources lo theevaluation of work already in progress and how far il is right lo expand activities which, though apparently promising, have not yet been fully evaluated. In thenext few years the emphasis may well need to be on more careful evaluation ofsmall scale experiments in the treatment of offenders rather than on the planning of a general expansion of methods of treatment that make heavy demands onlimited resources.AFTER-CARE AND THE CONTRIBUTION OFTHE PUBLICAFTER-CARE253. The probation and after-care service is now responsible for the after-care o&apos;all groups of offenders, including those released on parole. If after-care is to befurther developed as a major aspect of the treatment of offenders the service will need more trained stall&quot;, most working in the community but a proportionworking as welfare officers in penal institutions. There were 2,100 establishedprobation officers in 1964. There arc over 3,100 today and the&apos;Governmentexpects that there will be 3,500 by 1971. Associated with them will bean increasing number of voluntary workers.254. The Government intends to do all it can to encourage and assist voluntary organisations to expand the work of after-care hostels. The Government isalready making grants to 72 hostels in which nearly 800 places are available for people discharged from custody and it is hoped that at least another 1,000 placesmay be provided in the next few years.THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE PUBLIC255. Members of the public have an important part to play in after-care.Voluntary organisations can provide hostels, private individuals can befriend thedischarged prisoner and his family and can work as volunteers under the guidance
of the probation and after-care service. Private persons can also assist whileoffenders arc in custody. Voluntary organisations and private individuals may,for example, be able to help the wives and families of offenders lo meel (heloneliness and hardship Ilia! (he sentence may inevitably cause them, They can help during visits by looking after children. They can act as prison visitors. Theycan provide transport for relatives and friends to visil people in prison.256. K is not only the individual offender who can benefit from the maintenanceof a link with the community. So can the si off of the institution in which he isdetained. For example, the local College of Further Education or University mayassist with the training of slaff. On special occasions (he local parish may worshipin (he prison chapel. The Government thinks il important (lml a prison or horslalshould develop lies with (he local community. There may be a spoils day lowhich local people come, or an &quot;open day&quot; timing which Ihc local press and members of the public can learn of (he work of (he institution. There is the formal and valuable link provided by the Hoard of Visitors or Visiting Com-mittee* for the institution.257. The Government believes that such links wit Ii the local community help the stall&apos; to sec themselves as members of that community and enable I he public to take a more informed interest in what is being done in I heir name. For the routine opposition that is so frequently expressed to any proposal lo build a prison or borstal, or lo set up a hostel for ex-prisoners, in a particular area is often an opposition based on lack of information. The Govern men I and the prison service have an obligation lo provide such information. This is whyfacilities are now freely given to research workers and others lo study the work ofthe prison service, and why reporters and cameramen from press, radio and television are given much more access (ban hitherto.258. The share of national resources given lo the prison service and the probation and after-care service must, in a democracy, reflect in par! (he degreeof public knowledge, public understanding and public support of their work.It also reflects something of Ihc values of a. nation, changed as Ihey are from the days when Hawthorne could write of &quot;the black flower Of civilized society a prison&quot;. These services are charged with the duty of looking after and endeavour-ing to rehabilitate the offenders whom society has for a lime, anil for lack of anysafe alternative, committed lo custody. A society that believes in the worth of individual human beings can have Ihc quality of its belief judged, at least in part,by the quality of its prison and probation services and of the resources madeavailable to them.**A very brief account of the duties of these bailies is given in the glossary on page QJ],109
APPENDIXPROFILE OF POPULATION IN PRISON SERVICEESTABLISHMENTS1. The following paragraphs aim to give certain facts about people in custody: how many there arc; how old they are; of what offences they have been convicted; whatsentences they are serving and in what type of institution and how many times theyhave been in custody before. Some comparisons are made with earlier years. All thefigures relate to England and Wales. Much of the information comes from an analysis of the different groups of people sent to custody (&quot;receptions&quot;) in 1967, some comes from an analysis of the average population of prisons, borstals and detention centres in1968 and some from a special analysis of the records now available on a Home Officecomputer of all those in custody in March 1969. The totals in the different tables arenot therefore identical. Figures for prisons include remand centres.THE TOTALS FOR 19682.   The charts below show the main groups of people in custody in 1968.People in custody 1968Main groups of males in custody 1968 Main groups of females in custody 1968At a detention centre At a detention centreOn remandor awaiting sentenceSentencedto borstal155530425648.Civil prisoners&apos;A32Sentenced to imprisonmentup to 18 months&quot;Sentenced to imprisonmentover 18 months11.351Sentenced to imprisonmentover 18 months ;147Sontenced to imprisonmentup to 18 months&quot;275Civil prisoners178Sentenced to borstal180On remandor awaiting sentence123&quot;Including thoso committed to prison in default of payment of fines.31,656 male805 female

The number of women and girls in custody is only 800, not very different from the number in 1938 and much less than in 1913 while the number of men and boys in custody has increased three times since 1938. The illustration also shows how the prison service has devoted more of its resources since the war to special institutions for young offenders, only relatively few of whom now go to prison.4. The number of people in custody at any time is very small when expressed as a proportion of the total number of people in the country. Nevertheless as Table 2 shows the proportion of men and boys in custody has risen in the last ten years.TABLE 2Number of males and females in custody per 100,000 of the population&quot;in England and Wales in selected yearsMales Females		Number per		Number per		100,000 of male		100,000 of female		population of		population of year	A verage population	14 years of age	A verage population	16 years of age	in prisons.	and over in	in prisons,	and over in	borstals and	England and	borstals and	England and	detention centres	Wales	detention centres	Wales1958	24,459	146	920	5-11959	25,727	152	896	4-91960	26,198	154	901	4-91961	28,094	162	931	5-11962	30,066	171	997	5-41963	29,925	169	971	5-21964	28,718	161	882	4-71965	29,580	165	841	4-51966	32,127	178	959	5-11967	34,056	189	953	4-81968	31,656	175	805	4-2The population figures are the Registrar Generafs figures for the home population.
PERSONS NOT UNDER SENTENCE5. The charts on page gg showed that about 10 per cent of men and boys in custodyand over 20 per cent of the women and girls had not been sentenced. Table 3 showswho these people are.TABLE 31968Males FemalesUnder 21    21 and over    Under 21    21 and overUnconvicted........ 567 1,309 44 58Convicted and awaiting sentence etc. 526 640 46 32Civil prisoners       ..      ..      ..   432   2(A civil prisoner is one detained for failure to obey court orders, generally in respect of debts.)It is often appropriate to remand someone in custody if the court requires a full medicalor psychiatric report to be provided and there are some people who cannot safely beallowed bail. 30,864 of the people who were remanded, or committed in custody in 1968,most for short periods, were not sent to custody after sentence. Any unconvicted person is entitled to certain special facilities in custody and although this group of people formonly a small proportion of the total population at any one time, the prison service hasto devote a great deal of staff time, effort and skill to looking after them in local prisons(see paragraph Qjg) and in special remand centres for those under 21 (see paragraph g).YOUNG OFFENDERS6. The following paragraphs describe the young men in custody in senior detention centres and borstals or as young prisoners. They do not deal with women under 21 in custody or with the junior detention centres, whose average population in 1967 was267. A detention centre sentence is short, so that although 5,824 young men were received in the centres in 1967 the average population was only 1,318. The first twocharts at the top of the following page show their ages and the offences of which theyhad been convicted.7. The third chart shows that a small proportion of boys sent to detention centres only one in 8 were first offenders, while three quarters had between 1 and 5 previousproved offences. On the other hand only 1 in 7 of these boys had previously been at an approved school or received any institutional sentence. This is shown in the tableopposite.

Thus an offender who had been both fo an approved school and to a detention centre would be counted &quot;twice and..the figures given -are not mutually exclusive.
BORSTALS8. A young man sentenced to borstal training may spend between six months andtwo years in custody the average being something over a year and may be recalledto custody while under supervision after release. About 5,000 young men were sentenced to borstal training in 1967 and about the same number in 1968. The average population in 1968 was 5,648 and the following table shows where these young men were detained.TABLE 4Distribution of Borstal Population in 1968Prison or remand centre      ..      ..       259Allocation centreTraining borstalRecall centrePsychiatric centre7014,37729021Total5,648The two upper charts opposite show the age at which the young men received in 1967were sentenced and the offences for which they have been convicted.Almost half those sent to borstal have been convicted of breaking and entering and almost a quarter of theft.9. In terms of their previous criminal careers the young men at borstal are very different from those at senior detention centres. Only 3 per cent have no previousconvictions and over a quarter have more than six previous convictions. This infor-mation is given in the lower chart opposite (left).Even more striking is the fact that two thirds of the young men at borstal have pre-viously been in custody or approved school, often more than once (lower chart oppositeright). The table below the chart shows that over a third have been in approved schools and slightly more in detention centres.

YOUNG PRISONERS10. About 2,200 young men were received under sentence of imprisonment and 1,300in default of payment of a fine in 1967; the average number in custody in 1968 was985. Any figure for an average length of sentence would, however, be virtually meaning-less since because of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1961 almost all youngprisoners are either serving short sentences (of up to six months) or sentences of eighteen months and over. (See paragraph 00.) 292 were serving sentences of up to sixmonths, 69 over six and less than eighteen months, 463 from eighteen months to threeyears and 161 over three years.11. The upper chart opposite (left) shows that 3 out of 4 young prisoners were aged 19or 20 when sentenced. They are thus an older group than those sent to detention centres or borstal.As with all other young offenders the largest group had been convicted of breaking andentering, but as the upper chart opposite (right) shows 1 in 5 young prisoners in custodyhave been convicted of crimes of violence, including 2.6 per cent convicted of murder.12. Most young prisoners have been in trouble before only 1 in 12 being firstoffenders and more than 1 in 3 having more than 5 previous proved offences. Theproportion of young prisoners with no previous institutional sentence is however high(43 per cent). The information is given in the lower two charts and the following tableopposite.

Thus nn offender who has been to both an npproved school and to a detention centre would be counted twice, and the figures given are not mutually exclusive-
ADULT MALE PRISONERS13. Almost two thirds of those in custody are men over 21 sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Most of the men in this group are fairly young. Just under half are under thirty and only 1 in 5 is over 40. The age distribution is given in the upper chartopposite (left).14. As with young offenders the largest group of adult prisoners are serving sentencesfor breaking and entering or for theft. The next largest group of those in custody(about 10 per cent) are serving sentences for violence against the person and there aresmaller groups serving sentences for sexual offences, robbery and fraud. Theinformation is given in the upper chart opposite (right).LENGTH OF SENTENCE15. Table 5 shows the proportion of men in custody serving sentences of differentlengths. About 1 in 3 are serving sentences of from 6 to 18 months and less than 1 in 20is serving a sentence of ten years or more.Some further information about length of sentence and the small group serving very long sentences is given on pages 00-00.TABLE 5Analysis of the sentenced adult male population by length sentence(Based on population in March 1969)Length of sentence                                   No. in custody* %Up to 6 months.............. 3,071 14-8Over 6 months and up to 18 months ..      ..      ..      .. 6,501 31-4Over 18 months and less than 3 years        ..      ..      .. 3,699 17-93 years................ 2,191 10-6Over 3 years and less than 10 years........ 4,273 20-710 years................                 195 0-9Over 10 years (excluding life)..........                 202 1-0Life       ................                 566 2-720,698 100-0&quot;Including those committed to prison in default of payment of fines.PREVIOUS RECORD16. About 31,000 adult men were received under sentence of imprisonment and11,000 in default of payment of a fine in 1967. About 1 in 10 were first offenders andat the other extreme about 1 in 10 had over twenty previous convictions. 60 per cent of those sentenced to imprisonment had been in prison before. As many as 1 in 3 ofthose sentenced to imprisonment had not received any previous form of institutionalsentence while less than twenty per cent had already served 6 or more such sentences.The information is summarised in the two lower charts and in the table below them which, like the table on page 00, does not show how many offenders have previously been committed to more than one type of institution (see note at foot of page 00).It must be remembered, however, that these facts relate to all those sentenced to imprisonment and not to the population in custody at any one time.
