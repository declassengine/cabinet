TERMS FOR PARTIAL CONTRACTING OUT OF THE NATIONAL SUPERANNUATIONSCHEMEIntroduct ion2.      Last  January  in the White Paper &quot;National Superannuation and social  Insurance&quot;   (Cmnd.  3883)   the Government put  forward their proposals  for a national  superannuation scheme,  in which boththe pensions and the contributions were fully earnings-related,and which was designed to work in partnership with occupational pension schemes.    Facilities for partial  contracting out were included as an integral part  of  the arrangements,  so as  to reducethe need for occupational pension schemes to be cut  back to take account of  the enlarged State scheme.    Since January,  thesecontracting out  arrangements  have been worked out  in much more detail, and submitted for consideration to a wide range of representative organisations;.    After taking full  account of  theviews of  these organisations and following extensive discussions with them,  the Government have now reached their decisions on the contracting out provisions  for  inclusion  in the Bill which willembody their proposals  for earnings-related social  security.    they intend to present  the Bill  to Parliament  early in the new session.    The main features of  the contracting out arrangements are described  in the present White Paper.2.     Among those consulted in preparing the arrangements were theTrades Union Congress,  the Confederation of British Industry,  the life Offices Association and Associated Scottish Life Offices,  theNational Association of Pension Funds,  the representatives of the nationalised  industries:   there have also been discussions with anumber of  others,   including representatives; of  the local authorityassociat ions .STRUCTURE OF ABATEMENT SYSTEM3.     Basis of  contracting out  arrangements.    The basis  of  theproposed contracting out  arrangements was outlined  in chapter 5of &quot;National Superannuation and Social  Insurance&quot;.   Contracting outwas  to affect retirement pensions paid from the national superannuation Fund and c on tr ibu t i ons.. t o that Fund.    For an employeenot contracted out   these contributions were to amount  to&apos;4^ per cent of his earnings,   subject  to a ceiling,  and his employer was  tocontribute 4j per cent  on the whole of  the  employee^  earnings.    Thetotal  contributions of which these formed part were  to be at  the rateof 6-f per cent for  the  employee and at  the same rate for  the employerSince publication of  the &quot;White Paper the contracting out arrangements proposed have been thoroughly  tested in discussion and  they are nowadopted in the f ol lowing form.- -    Employ e e s   who  arecontracted out by their employers as members of  an occupational pension scheme will pay national  superannuation contributions at  a lower percentage of  their earnings  than other  employees,  and the employer&apos;s contribution for them will also be at a lower percentage up to2.
the scheme&apos;s  earnings ceiling   (of  about  36 a week  in  terms ofApril  1969 earnings).    As  counterpart,   there will  be a deduction from the employee&apos;s personal  retirement pension under  the state scheme, which will  be made  good by a pension guaranteed  to him under his   occupational   scheme.    Technically,   this   is  known as  an&quot;abatement&quot;  system,   the reductions  in State  scheme contributions and benefits being referred  to as &quot;abatements&quot;.    The contributionabatements will   apply   to periods   of  contracted out   serviceoccurring at  any  time between the beginning of  the  income  taxyear  in which an employee  reaches   the  age of   19  and attainment of State pensionable age   (65  for men,   60  for women).4&quot;.      If an employee  leaves  an employment   after  less  than 5 years&apos;contracted out   service  it will  be open to his  employer  either  toprovide him with an occupational  pension  of   the  required amount,or alternatively  to buy him back fully into  the State scheme by making a &quot;payment   in  lieu of   contributions&quot;   to  that   scheme.    This&quot;payment   in  lieu&quot; will  be  simply  the amount  needed   to make upto the full  rate the abated contributions paid by  the employeeand his  employer.    As under  the present contracting outarrangements,   the employer will  have a right   to recover  the employee&apos;s  share of   the &quot;payment   in  lieu&quot;  from any  refund  of occupational   scheme contributions due   to  him for  the  periodconcerned.     In conformity with  the Governments  general  policy  onthe preservation of  occupational  pension rights,  as  set  out   in chapter 6 of  &quot;National Superannuation and Social  Insurcince&quot; ,   the employer will  be required  to provide an occupational pension(deferred or  in payment,  according to  the employee&apos;s age)   for anyemployee who  leaves  after his  contracted out  service under the new scheme has  lasted for 5 years  or more.5.     An &quot;undynamiscd&quot; abatement  system.     In developing  theproposals for partial  contracting out, a basic  issue  to be decidedwas whether  the pension to be guaranteed by  the occupational scheme should be fixed  in money  terms, or whether,  as proposed for the State pension,  it  should be subject   to revaluation every two years to reflect movements  in price and  earnings  levels.     Itwas argued by  the nationalised  industries  in particular,   thatcontracting out  facilities  should be provided under which  thepart of  the State pension for which the occupational  schemes  took over responsibility would   include a &quot;dynamic&quot;  element;   that:   is,as a condition for  contracting out,   the  occupational  scheme wouldhave to guarantee  to provide an amount of pension to be revaluedperiodically,  up to  the point  of  award,   in line with  the risein national  average earnings,   in the  same way as State pension entitlement will  be revalued.    This was  seen as a means of enabling  schemes which have pensions  based3 .
on  the  employee&apos;s  final   salary  -  and  thus already   include a&quot;dynamic&quot;  element   -  to  live alongside  the new State  scheme without   the need  for  substantial   adaptation of   their ownprovi s i ons.6.      The Government   saw  two  obstacles  to  this   suggestion.     Inthe  first  place,   there would be  no  satisfactory basis   for determing what  abatements  should be allowed   from the state scheme  contributions under a system which  required  the occupational   scheme   to  guarantee  to  provide a pensionincorporating  at   least   as high  a degree of  &quot;dynamism&quot;  as   theState  pension;     this   is because  the   cash amount   of   pension  tobe provided at   pension  age by  the occupational   scheme  couldvary  over a very wide  range depending  upon  the   future movementof  earnings.     Secondly,   it  was  clear   that   although  certainlarge  schemes would  feel   able  to bind   themselves   to  fulfil   the open-ended commitment   involved,   smaller  schemes   in  the  private sector  - and  indeed many of   the  larger  schemes   - would not   (eelable   to undertake  to do  this.     Unless  therefore   there  was adifferent   contracting  out   system  for   them,   which would  over-complicate  the   arrangements,   they would  effectively be denieda  contracting  out  option.7.       For   these  reasons,   the Government  have decided   that   theyshould provide  a  single  contracting  out   system and   that   thisshould be &quot;undynamised&quot;.     Thus,   the  pension  to be guaranteed by  the  occupational   scheme will   be   fixed  at  a  specific  cashamount   (related  to   the  employee&apos;s  earnings)   and   the  state scheme will  be  responsible  for providing  each  contracted outemployee with the   same  enhancements  of his  pension   to  reflectprice and  earnings  rises  as   if  he held not  been   contracted  out .This means   that   for  contracted out   employees   the  State  scheme will  be providing  these  improvements,  not  only on  the amount  oftheir State  pension,   but   also on  the amount  of  pension which their occupational   scheme   is  required  to  guarantee.     This   is a factor of   considerable   importance  in  assessing   the Statebenefits which  contracted out   employees will   receive   in  returnfor  their  contributions.8.      A single  level  of   abatement.    The nationalised   industries were  also  prominent   in  representing   that,   even  though   therewere   to  be only one kind of   contracting  out   system,   therewould be advantage  in offering  abatement   at  more   than  one   level.Employers would thus be able  to  choose whether  to  take over responsibility  for a smaller or  larger slice of   the  State  schemepension.    Those supporting  this view argued that   such a choicewould be helpful   in limiting  the need  to  adapt  occupational schemes  since,   in each  case,   the abatement   level   could be selected which best  fitted  in with the scale of benefits  already provided under   the particular occupational   scheme.4.
9,      The Government   examined this  suggestion with great   care.They had to weigh its attractions against  the  consideration  thatto have alternative  contracting out  options,   associated with alternative  levels of  State  scheme  contributions,  would be boundto add complication and difficulties on  the  introduction of   thenew State  scheme.    A  fully earnings-related  State pension  schemecannot avoid a considerable degree of complication asexamples of  such schemes   in other countries   show;    but to keepthe  scheme  understandable   is  essential   to   its  smooth  introductionand effective working.     It   is   significant   that  nowhere else   inthe world has  a precedent  been  found  for   incorporating   in  such  a fully earnings-rel ated scheme a  contracting out   facility  - even at one  level   - designed  to provide a basis of  partnership withoccupational   schemes.     Having weighed  the advantages  and disadvantages,   the Government   have been bound  to   conclude  that,even  though a  choice between  two  levels of  abatement  would helpsome occupational   schemes,   the   interests of   contributors  and employers   in having   clear-cut  arrangements  require  that   thereshould be no more  than a  single   contracting out  option.PENSION ABATEMENTS]0.    The  pension  abatements for men.     The  essential  nature of   the contracting out   facility having been decided,   it  was possibleto tackle   the  crucial  question of  the  level   at  which the  pensionabatements  and  the  contribution  abatements  should be  set.There was  general  agreement   that   it  would be  right   to  considerfirst   the  best   level   of  pension  abatement  and  then  to   settle the abatement   terms by deciding  what   the  contribution abatementsshould be  for these  pension abatements    Clearly,   the  pensionabat ements mus t not  be   set   so high as  to  be  in any danger ofmore  than  eliminating  the whole  State  pension.     This  points   toa level  of   abatement  not   exceeding  the minimum  rate  at whichpension builds up in  the State  scheme,   i.e.   the  rate of build-upfor a person who  is  19 when  the  scheme  starts and  earnsthoughout at   the  top earnings  level  covered by  the  scheme.Taking this   into account,   the Government   suggested   initially,,as a basis  for discussion,   that   the   right  annual  pensionabatement   for men might  be around 0.8  per  cent   of   the  employee&apos;sreckonable  earnings   in  his   contracted out   employment,   or perhapssi igh 11 y higher .11.    In the event,   the  response  from those concerned withoccupational   schemes  showed that  there would be wide  support for going beyond a pension abatement of  0.8 per  cent  and setting  the pension abatement  level  at  1   per cent ofreckonable  earnings.     Some of   those  particularly concerned with  the  larger schemes would have wished5.
to go higher  - even as high as  1.8 per cent  of  reckonable earnings.This would mean,  however,   setting the pension to be guaranteed byoccupational  schemes at  a level which many schemes with a moderatescale of benefits  would not be able to match.    With a pensionabatement much above  1 per cent  of  earnings,   there could be no guarantee that,  even allowing for rising  earnings, abatement wouldnot eventually lead  in some cases  to  the total  elimination of   theState pension.    There would also be a  serious risk that  contracted out employees,  particularly those  in the younger  age groups atthe start  of  the new scheme,  would qualify for  lower Statepensions  than they would have received under  the present   scheme.This  in turn would mean that  some occupational   schemes wishing to contract  out would actually have to increase  their  benefits for particular  groups  of  employees  if  the total  State and occupational benefits of   these employees were not  to fall below their existing  level.    This would add  to the problems  of adjustmentwhich it  is   the Government 1s  intention to minimise.12.    The Government have decided,   in the light  of   the  response  tjtheir earlier proposal,   that   it would be right  to raise  thelevel of pension abatement  for men to  1 per cent  of  reckonableearnings.    Most of  those who took part  in the discussions agreedthat  this  is  the  best  single  level  of abatement  for men,   in thatit will most  easily enable  schemes  to live alongside  the state scheme.    A 1 per  cent pension abatement will mean that for  each 1,000 of  earnings on which an employee contributes  to  the state scheme at  the contracted out  rate,  his State pension will belower by  10 a year  than if he had paid  the full  contribution on those earnings;     and his occupational   scheme will have to guarantee to provide an equivalent amount  of pension.13.    The pension abatementsfor women.     It has all along been recognised  that  if  the pension abatements for women were  to be  setat the same   level  as  for men,  their contribution abatements wouldhave to be higher  than  for men.    This  is because it necessarilycosts much more to provide a given rate of pension for a womanfrom her minimum pension age of  60  than for a man from hisminimum pension age of  65.    Among  those consulted,   there weredifferences  of  view on whether  it  wj uld be better  to   start  offthe new scheme with a common pension abatement  for men and women,or a common contribution abatement;     everyone recognised thatit would not be possible  to have both.    The Government have decidedthat,   taking into account  convenience of payrol 1 ing for  employers,it will be best  to start  the  scheme with a common contributionabatement  for both  sexes,   so that  for contracted out  employees,as for others,  the contribution rates  for men and women willbe uniform.     In view of  the many changes  that will  affect  employersat the start of  the  scheme,   there  is a strong case for making  the initial  arrangements as simple as possible,   even  though,   later  on,circumstances could arise as a result  of  which the contributionabatements  for men and women might diverge.6.
14,   The Government Actuary was  asked  to advise what   the pensionabatement   should be for women  to match a pension abatement  of1 per cent  of   earnings  for  men,   on  the assumption   that   the contribution abatement   would  be uniform for both  sexes.    As   shownin paragraph 7 of the annexed memorandum,  he advised  that  the pensionabatement   for women  should be set  at   0.55  per .cent  of reckonableearnings.    The   interests  consulted have not   differed from this advice,  which, the Government, have accepted.nONTRIBUT ICN ABATEMENTS15,    Basis  for  assessing  the_contribution abatements.Having  secured  a wide measure of  agreement  on  the pension abatements,the next  step was  to determine  the contribution abatements.    TheGovernment  referred  this  question for  advice  to  the government actuary,  who  is   the Government&apos;s  independent  professional   adviser on all  actuarial  matters  and   is  responsible also for advising anumber of  occupational  pension schemes  in  the public  sector.    Thegeneral  basis for assessing the contribution abatements had been laid down  in paragraph  139 of  &quot;National    Superannuation and social insurance&quot;,  which  said   that   the &quot;formula  linking  the deduction from contributions  to   the deduction from pension would be  fixed in sucha way  that   the   total  amount  by which contributions were reduced  -for employer and employee  together represented,  on average,   thecommercial  cost  of providing  the pension for which  the occupational scheme was  taking over responsibility from the State.    The main factors  to be taken into account   in fixing  the formula would be   the accumulation of   interest  on an invested  fund,  mortality,  and  theage distribution and  earnings of  contracted out   employees&quot;.16.    Reviews  of   the abatement   terms.     Before  the Government  Actuarycould make his assessment he needed  to know what  arrangements wouldbe made for keeping the  terms of abatement under review.    Thenecessity for regular reviews was urged by all   those  consulted.But although assurance was needed that  the  terms would not  beallowed  to remain for  long periods out  of  line with current  costs,it was also essential   that  occupational  pension schemes  should beable to rely on a reasonable degree of  stability  in thearrangement s .17.    To provide  this  stability  the Government decided  that   the levels of pension abatement   laid down should be regarded as apermanent  feature of   the scheme and  that  the  legislation should contain no power  for   them to be  altered.    Thus,  any changes7.
needed in  the abatement   terms  from time  to  time,   to reflectchanges  in  the  factors on which  they are based,  will  be effected by altering  the contribution abatements  and not   the pensionabatements .18     As  the regular   interval between reviews,  a period of 4 years has proved generally acceptable to those consulted,and is what  the Government have decided on.    The government recognise,  however,   that  circumstances  could  occasionallyarise in which  this   interval would prove  to be too long.They have  therefore decided - again with a wide measure of support  -  that  there should be held  in reserve the possibilityof an additional review at  the mid-point  of  any 4-yearlycycle if  there had been such an exceptionally large changein the rates  of  interest  or other relevant  factors  sincethe previous review as  to leave the terms badly out of   line with current  circumstances.    As part  of  their commitment on the review arrangements  the Government now state,  as their firm intention,   that  the  initial   terms  laid down should remain in operation for at  least   3 years  from the start  ofthe new scheme  (including the  time that will  be needed to effect any change after   it  has been announced).19.    When   the   terms  are  due   to be  reviewed,   the Government will arrange  for  consideration  of   the  relevant   factors  by   theGovernment Actuary  and  for consultation with representatives  of occupational pension schemes and with both sides  of   industry.    no decision will  be made about  any change  in  the  terms  before  thisconsultation has   taken place.    Any change decided upon will  beeffected by Order requiring  the affirmative  resolution of bothHouses  of Parliament.    A sufficient  interval will  be allowed afterthe announcement  of   the change  to give  employers   time   to review the effect  on  their occupational  schemes  and on  their contracting out decisions.    Any change will   take effect  from  the  beginning  ofan income   tax year.20.    The Government Actuary&apos;s  advice  on  the abatement   terms.The Government Actuary advised  that,   on actuarial   grounds,   taking into account   the arrangements  for periodic review of   the abatementterms,   a  contribution abatement  amounting  to 2.5 per  cent  of   the employee&apos;s  reckonable  earnings   -   that   is   1.25 per  cent  each   foremployee and employer  - would represent   terms which should be fairboth to  the average contracted out  scheme and  to employees notcontracted out.    The  full   text of  the Government Actuary&apos;s adviceis reproduced  in the annexed memorandum.    He based his  calculationson the following assumptions:1.       interessees t.    The average yield obtainable  on newinvestments   in  the  first 4-year period  from  the start of  the new scheme would be l\ per cent and  the averageyield on reinvestments of   interest over  the period untilthe employees  concerned  reached pensionable  age would be5j per cent.8.CONFIDENTIAL
2.      Mor ta1i ty.     The mortality rates  should be  based on   therates used  in  the national population projections,adjusted  to  take account  of   the   lower mortalityexperienced among members  of  occupational  pension schemes and making allowance  for future  improvement   inmortality  in  the   light  of  past  experience.3.      Expenses.    7 per cent  of  the amounts derived fromcontribution abatement would be absorbed  in meetingexpenses.21.    The correctness  of   the Government Actuaryrs advice,   on  thebasis  of   the assumptions  he had made,   was not  challenged.    Butthere were various  criticisms of   the assumptions   themselves,leading up   to  the general  criticism  that   the  terms were  tootightly drawn because  they provided no financial  inducement  tothe average  scheme  to contract  out and would be particularlyunattractive   to schemes with a membership  older   than  the average.22.    Suggestion that  a financial   inducement   to contract  out  shouldbe  linked with  &quot;super-abatement&quot;.     It would  undoubtedly  encourage the spread of  occupational  schemes  if  it  were known  that by setting up a contracted out  scheme an employer could reduce hisown contributions  to  the State  scheme and  those  of  his  employeesby an amount which would  be more   than sufficient   to providepensions  equivalent   to  the deductions  from  the State pension.     the resultant  &quot;profit&quot;  could  either be used  to  limit   the  occupational scheme contributions of  employers and employees   (so  that   in totalthey would pay  less  than   if   the  employees  participated  fully  inthe State  scheme)  or else could go to provide occupational  schemepensions which would be higher  than  the amounts deducted from  theState pension.23.     In order   to  secure   that  generous  contribution abatementswould be used for providing extra pension under any  schemes  setup with  the  intention of   contracting out,   and not   for other purposes,   it was  suggested by some of  those consulted  that   itshould be made a condition  for contracting  out   that   the pension   tobe guaranteed by  the occupational  scheme must be higher by,   say20 per cent  than  the amount  to be deducted  from the State pension.The Government  recognise   the force of   the argument   for  anarrangement  of  this  sort,  which has been called &quot;super-abatement&quot;.After careful  consideration,  however,  and  taking  into account   the strong body of  opinion against  it,   they have decided  that  super-abatement  should not be adopted.     In  the  first place,   anythingother  than a direct  equivalence between the pension abatementand the amount of pension  to be  guaranteed by  the occupational scheme would make  the arrangements more difficult    to understandand to work.    Secondly,   although super-abatement would ensurethat &quot;profits&quot; derived from occupational   schemes set up with  theintention of contracting out went  into  the provision of better pensions,9.
it would by no means follow that  contracted out  employees werepaying a proper contribution to the State scheme for  the benefitsthey would receive from it.    On the contrary,  if  the contributionabatements were large enough to ensure that,  for no greater  totalcontributions  to  the State scheme and their  occupational   scheme,contracted out  employees  could be guaranteed higher  total    pensionsthan other  employees,   this must mean that  the contributions of contracted out  employees would not  represent   their  fair  shareof the cost of   the State scheme.    To provide conditions  in whichoccupational  schemes will  thrive is  one of  the Government *sprime objectives,  but   it  cannot be pursued by means which wouldbe unjust  to those employees who are not members of  occupational scheme s.24.    Decision on the abatement  terms.    The Government  recognisehowever  that  the age distribution of  individual schemes may bewide of  the average;     they recognise too  that   the large majorityof schemes have only a  small number   of members,  and  that  inconsequence they tend  to have costs which are disproportionatelyhigh.    The effect  of   these factors will  vary as between schemes;but as  the Government Actuary has  explained in paragraph 9 of his memorandum,  even a  slight  &quot;improvement&quot;  in the contracting outterms could  significantly increase  the number  of  schemes whichdecide  to take advantage of  the contracting out  facility.Admittedly,   such an &quot;improvement&quot; would have to apply  to allcontracted out  schemes,   including  those which would have foundterms based on strict averaging acceptable.    Furthermore,   theinterest rates used by the Government Actuary in his calculations(paragraph 3 of his memorandum)  are so much below those now rulingthat a continuance of  interest rates at  their present   levels to uldmake the contribution abatements he has recommended more  thansufficient  in most  cases  to provide  the amounts of pension  to be guaranteed,  even for  schemes with above-average costs.    But  thefact  remains  that,   for a  large number of  schemes,  even a slightadjustment  of   the  terms  could prove  to be crucial.    After carefulconsideration,   the Government have decided that,  for  this reason,they are justified  in going beyond  the terms recommended on strictactuarial  grounds by the Government Actuary,  and setting  the contribution abatements for both men and women at  2.6 per cent  ofreckonable earnings  i.e.   1.3 per cent  a side.    This  should make a significant difference to the number of   schemes  contracted out,  andis thus consistent with  the Government 1s  aim of providing scope for at  least as much contracting out  as  at present,  and perhapsrather more.    To have  gone further and allowed contributionabatements of   1.5 per cent  a side,  as was urged by a great majorityof the organisations  consulted, would have left  employees notcontracted out  with  the  legitimate complaint   that  the differencebetween their State scheme contributions and  those of contracted out employees was greater than the difference in their pensionscould justify.10.
EFFECT OF ABATEMENT ARRANGEMENTS25.    Effect  on contributions.    Assuming,  as  in &quot;national superannuation and Social Insurance&quot;,  a  total contribution of6l per cent  of reckonable earnings *  for employees not  contracted out,  a contribution abatement of  1.3 per cent a side wouldmean a contribution of  5.45 per cent   (6.75 per cent   less  1.3 percent)  for  those contracted out.    At  the  top of the earningsrange covered by the  scheme,  a person contributing on  36  a weekearnings  (the approximate  level  of  the new scheme&apos;s  earningsceiling at   1969    earnings  levels)  would pay 9s.  4d.  a week  less  ifcontracted  out  than if  participating fully in the State scheme;and there would be an equivalent  reduction  in the employer &apos;scontributions.    The effect of  increasing the contribution abatementto 1.5 per cent  a  side,  as was urged by the great majority  of  the organisations consulted,  would have been  to add  Is.   5d.  a  side to the maximum reduction of State scheme contributions  on accountof contracting out.26.    The effects  of   the change from the present  scheme  contributions to the new scheme contributions  on the amounts which contracted out employees have to pay will  depend on  the level of present scheme contributi ons at  the time the new scheme  starts.    On thebasis  of  the rates payable under  the present  scheme  from November  this year,   the following  tables   (see pages   14 and  15)compare    the rates of  contribution paid by employees  at .variousearnings  levels under  the present  scheme with those that would be paid bycontracted out  employees on  the same earnings under  the new scheme.27.    Effect  on the finance of  the State scheme.    Since  thenational  superannuation scheme will be  financed on a pay-as-you-gobasis,  any contracting out  facility is bound to bring forward  thepoint at which an  increase  in the  initial contribution rates willbe needed to prevent   the scheme 1s   income falling  short  of  its  outgo.This  is because the effect  of  the contribution abatements  for those contracted out will be felt   immediately, whereas  thecorresponding saving  in pension expenditure will   emerge onlygradually as  the people concerned come to draw their pensions.Detailed estimates,   showing the  effect  on the finances  of  theState scheme of a  1.3 per cent  a side contribution abatement withparticular numbers of  employees  contracted out,   will be given  in  thereport by  the Government Actuary on the Bill providing for  thenew scheme.     It  can be said now,  however,   that  even allowing forsome increase   in  the present numbers contracted  out,   the  initial* The employee&apos; s   total contribution may not be precisely 6^ percent  of his  reckonable earnings.    This  is because  the 2 per cent for purposes  other  than national  superannuation may requirerevision,    for   the reasons explained in paragraph 41  of  the white paper &quot;Social  Insurance;    Proposals for Earnings-Related Short-Term and Invalidity Benefits&quot;   (Cmnd.  4124);    no final decision has yet been taken,  but  the figures will  be in the Bill   shortly to be pub 1i shed.11.
contribution rate to  the National Superannuation Fund proposedin Cmnd .   3883  (4jf per  cent  of  earnings,   subject  to a ceiling,for employees;     and 4^ per cent, with no ceiling,   for  employers)should,  on the  terms  of abatement   set out above,  be sufficient for 5 years or  so after  the start  of  the scheme.CONCLUSION28.    In devising  the arrangements  for partial  contracting outof the national   superannuation scheme the Government&apos;s aim hasbeen to provide a firm basis  for partnership between  the state scheme and occupational  schemes.    The form of   this partnershiphas to take account  of   the wide variety among  schemes bothin size of membership and scale of  benefits.    Decisions aboutcontracting out  are ultimately for   individual  schemes  and for employers  to take,  but  the Government&apos;s purpose has been  to  settleterms consistent with the aim of  enabling the number of  employeescontracted out   to continue at  least at  the  same level  as underthe present  scheme,   and perhaps  rise rather higher.    After carefulconsideration,   the Government have decided  that  it  would be rightto provide abatement   terms rather more fabourable  to occupational schemes  than could be justified on a strict actuarial  calculationbased on averages.    They have recognised, however,   that  such animprovement must  not be pressed beyond the point at which  it  wouldbecome unfair  to  the many employees who have no opportunity of membership of  a contracted out  scheme.    To have accepted the viewof the great majority of organisations consulted  that  the contribution abatements  should be set at  1.5 per cent a side ofreckonable  earnings,   in relation to  the pension abatementsproposed,  would have involved a deliberate and unjustified tiltingof the balance against  those employees who were not  contracted out.29.    Taking all   these considerations  into account   the Government 1sdecision is  that,   subject  to Parliamentary approval,  partialcontracting out  of   the national  superannuation scheme  should beon the basis of pension abatements amounting to  1 per cent  ofreckonable  earnings  for men and 0.55 per  cent  of  reckonableearnings for women;     and  that, as counterpart,   the abatementsof the employees&apos;   and  employers&apos;   contributi ons  should be1.3 per cent a  side of the employee&apos;s reckonable earnings,  for both men and women.    These  terms,  which would remain  in effect for at  least the  first  3 years  of  the  scheme,  would be reviewed at 4-yearly intervals  - with the possibility of  a change half way through  the 4-yearly cycle,  but only if  there had been  such an exceptional  change  in interest  rates or other relevant  factors as to make  the current  terms badly outmoded.30.   The new State scheme will  replace the  exis ting scheme ofnational  insurance,  which provides a basic  flat-rate retirement pension with a small  graded element,  by a comprehensive scheme  offully earnings-related national  superannuation which will   for  thefirst  time offer  to all  contributors,  whether  or not  they enjoy12.
the cover  of an occupational  scheme,  retirement pensions at anadequate  level.    This will necessarily require employers andothers responsible for   the management  of  occupational  schemes to consider what adaptations might be needed  to  take accountof the changes  in  the State provision.    The Government  have recognised  from the outset  that  for many occupational  schemesparticularly those which make substantial provision for  their&apos;members,  the conclusion must  be  that  some adjustments wouldhave to be made.    The adjustments needed would not,  of coursereduce pensions already earned;     they would affect futurecontributions and  the future buiId-up of benefits.    The formof adjustment  may differ from scheme to scheme,  as best  servedthe interests  of   the  scheme members (and in some cases  the  scheme may be enlarged so as  to satisfy  the contracting out conditions).The purpose of  the contracting out   system is to offer  goodoccupational  schemes  the opportunity of  limiting  the degree ofadaptation needed,  by abatement of  the State scheme contributions and benefits.    The Government are confident   that  the arrangementsfor partial   contracting out  set out  in this White Paper will  be of substantial  assistance  in reducing  the disturbance caused and  inmaking  it  easier  for occupational  schemes  to  live alongside  thenew State scheme  - whose main object  it  is   to  ensure a betterstandard of  pension provision than ever before,   financed on abasis which will be fair  to all.13.

annex memorandum by the Government Actuaryon Terms; of Contracting out.      The White Paper of January 1969 (Cmnd. 3883) stated the principlethat for employees subject to partial contracting out the deduction from national Superannuation contributions should be linked to the deduction from pensions on the basis of &quot;commercial cost&quot;.     The considerations involved are similar in many ways (but not all) to those which enter intothe assessment of rates of premium on life office pension contracts and contributions to self-administered occupational pension schemes.     I havebeen assked  to advise  the. Secretary of State for Social Services on(i)the contribution abatement that would be appropriate to a pensionabatement for a man of 1% of earnings and (ii) what the correspondingpension abatement should be for a woman if her contribution abatement werethe same as for a man.2.      The rates of single premium charged by life assurance companies forwithout-profit pensions provided an obvious starting point for assessing&quot;commercial cost&quot; but these rates were unsatisfactory as a basis forseveral reasons.       In the first place the rates vary considerably from oneoffice to another;   secondly, fewer than one-half of the members of occupational pension schemes have their benefits provided through contracts with life assurance companies and there has been a marked trend in recentyears for such contracts to be on a with-profits basis.     Those coveredby without-profit contracts are nowadays very much in a minority and are usually members of smaller schemes, which tend to be relatively expensiveto administer.     It was also difficult to derive a suitable basis from a consideration of the finances of privately-administered funds for manyreasons including the fact that provision is usually made, directly or indirectly, for future changes in earnings levels which are irrelevantwhen considering terms for contracting out under the system proposed.It was, therefore, necessary to make a special calculation taking intoaccount the basic factors of interest, mortality and expenses.Interest16.
Interest&apos;3.      It is intended that the terms for contracting out should be examined at four-yearly intervals, with the possibility of a review at the raid-point of any four-yearly cycle if circumstances demand it.     I have considered the rates of interest at which it might be possible to makeinvestments in the first four-year period from the start of the new scheme,tho target date for which is 1972.     The yield at present obtainable on long-terra British Government securities is over 9%&apos;     This ishistorically high and in assessing &quot;commercial cost&quot; some reduction should,in my view, be allowed for;   I have thought it reasonable to assume that anaverage yield of        would be obtainable on new investments in the period in question.     Investments made during&apos; these four years will themselvesproduce income which will need to be reinvested until the employees concerned reach retirement age.     I have assumed that the average yieldobtainable on such reinvestments will be 5%%.Mortalityk.      The mortality assumptions have to be appropriate to members of occupational schemes which cover employees in a wide range of occupations.The Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau of the Institute and the faculty of Actuaries has examined the mortality of members and pensionersunder insured pension schemes and I have used the results of theseinvestigations, supplemented by data from a number of large public serviceschemes, to obtain factors indicating the amounts by which mortality underoccupational schemes is lpwer than that of the population of England andWales.     The calculations were based on the mortality rates used in thenational population projections adjusted by the above factors.     these rates make allowance for future improvement in mortality in the light of past experience.     Specimen rates are shown in Table 1.Expenses5.      I have assumed that T/o of the amounts derived from contributionabatements will be absorbed in meeting expenses.     From the information available to me this is likely to be greater than the provision needed by large pension schemes where economies of scale can be assumed, butbelow the provision in small schemes which are relatively costly toadminster. &apos;Relationship17.
Relationship between abatement of pension and abatement of contributeon6.      Using these bases, calculations were made of the relationchipwhich should hold between tha abatement of contribution at any ,given age and the corresponding abatement of pension.     Under the proposed methodiof contracting out, however, it is essential for practical reasons to have one overage factor for all men irrespective of age, and a correspondingfactor for woman.     This involves a system of averaging which should take account of the distribution according to age and earnings of members ofpension schemes;     for this purpose I have used the distribution of employees contracted out under the existing arrangements.     Under theproposals it v/ill be possible for an employee leaving a recognisedpensionable employment to be brought back into the State scheme tay makinga &quot;payment-in-lieu&quot; if the contracted out employment has lasted less than five years;    after that, the occupational scheme will have to make provision for preserving the pension.     The malting of a payment--in-l:i.euwill effectively cancel contracting out and most such cases will occurat the younger ages.     To allow for this I have used the distribution byage and earnings of employees now contracted out at ages 25 and over (see table 2).    On this basis  the abatement  for men is 2.5 per cent of reckonable earnings,   that   is  1.25 per cent  each foremployee and employer  in return for an abatement of  1 per cent of earnings from the pension eventually receivable from theState.7.       There is to be a common rate of contribution abatement for bothsexes but allowance has to be made for the facts that women live longer than men, their pensionable age is five years younger and their distributionaccording to age and earnings is different.     Taking these into account the pension abatement for women (corresponding to 1% for men) is 0.55/u 0^earnings.     &apos;),l8.      Although the above overage relationships will, in my view, be fair,as between those contracted out of the State scheme and those notcontracted out, and v/ill be appropriate for most schemes, the actual agodistribution of a scheme will be an important factor to be considered byan employer when deciding whether or not to contract out.     Those withan unusually young staff should find the abatements of contribution morethan adequate to replace the part of the State pension which their employees will forfeit on contracting out, whereas the reverse will applyto those with a staff whose average age is relatively high.     It isimpossible with a scheme based on averages to avoid these effects in suchcases. . i1-8 - 8A.CONFIDENTIAL
!);.   Something can be done, however, to ease the difficulties of schemes which find these &quot;average&quot; terms barely attractive enough on financial grounds.I understand that for this reason the G-overnment have decided to allow anabatement of contribution of 1 .3Jo a side of earnings, instead of 1.25$!, fora pension abatement of 1% of earnings for men or of 0.55% for women.   Theaverage ages for the various schemes tend to be closely concentrated aboutthe &quot;breakeven&quot; point and this improvement in the terms should be sufficientto make them financially acceptable to a further number of schemes coveringan appreciable number of employees.Revision of terms10.   The need for revision of the terms of contracting out will occur ifthere has been a significant change in interest, mortality or expenses andperiodical reviews will have to take into consideration any movement inthese.11.   The basis of averaging the calculated age-related rates in order toarrive at the single factors required in practice is also of great importance and will have to be considered carefully in relation to information regardingthe numbers, ages and earnings of employees contracted out of the new schemeand further information which may become available regarding the membership of occupational pension schemes as a whole.HERBERT TETLEYGovernment Actuary1 s Department.19.CONFIDENTIAL
