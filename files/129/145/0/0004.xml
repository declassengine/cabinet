IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(69)1293rd October, 1969CABINETCONTINUANCE OF THE MURDER (ABOLITION of death PENALTY) ACT, 1965Memorandum by the Attorney General and the Solicitor general as agreed by Hie Cabinet on 25th September(CC(69) 45th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Lord Chancellor has asked us tosubmit advice on the question whether legislation extending the life of the murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act, 1965 could be introduced duringthe latter part of the next Session if resolutions under section 4 of thatAct were moved shortly after its commencement and were defeated in either House,2,      The basic rule, as stated at page 396 of Erskine May, is:- &quot;Noquestion or Bill shall be offered in either House that is substantially thesame as one on which its judgment has already been expressed in thecurrent Session&quot;.    We understand that officials in both Houses take theview that it is out of order to introduce a Bill producing a result identicalto that rejected on an earlier resolution.    Thus if a resolution undersection 4 of the 1965 Act to make that Act permanent were defeated atthe commencement of next Session, it would be impossible to make itpermanent by legislating in that Session.    On the other hand, therewould seem to be no procedural objection to a Bill extending the 1965Act for a period of years.3,      One possibility which has been canvassed is that an amendment to the resolution under the 1965 Act might be moved in one House or theother in an attempt to provide for the extension of the life of the Act bya period of years, instead of making it permanent.    We understand thatsuch an amendment would not be ruled out of order in either Hoosa,    Ifsuch an amendment were carried it might give rise to doubts about itslegal effect.    In such an important matter as this, in our view legislation would be neces-sary to put the matter beyond doubt.    We have consideredwhat form such legislation could take0    If the resolution under the 1965Act had been amended to provide for the extension of the life of that Actfor a period of years, then it is likely that it would not be in order tointroduce in the same Session a Bill making that Act permanent.    This-1-copy NO.     &quot; *
is because a vote for the amendment to the resolution is in effect a vote against making the 1965 Act permanent, and the basic rule wc have described above would apply.    Another question is the effect of thepassing of such an amendment upon the possibility of introducing legislation to extend the 1965 Act by a period of years.    Provided that the Billproposes a different period from that specified in the amendment tothe resolution we can see no reason why there should be any proceduralobjection to such a Bill.40      We have considered what amendments would be within the scopeof a Bill to extend the life of the 1965 Act for a period of years.    Byanalogy to the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill it would appear thatamendments intended to revive the death penalty for particularcategories of murder subject to it under the 1957 Ac*:, or to reviveit for other categories, cr otherwise to alter the law of murder wouldnot be admissible.    Unfortunately the rules about scope arc verydifficult to apply with any degree of certainty, and the possibilitycannot be ruled out of such an amendment being called if it is skilfullydrafted.5.       Our conclusions arO(l)     If the resolution to make the 1965 Act permanent is rejected in either House it will be possible to legislate in the same Session to extend the life of that Act for a period of years, but not to legislate to make theAct permanent.(2)     If the resolution to make the 1965 Act permanent is amended by either House in an attempt to extend the Act for a period of years, itwill be possible to legislate in the same Session to extend the life ofthe Act for a different period of years;  and such legislation would, inthat event, be necessary.(3) A Biil to extend the life of the 1965 Act would bo of limited scope,and amendments to it intended to restore the death penalty for categories of murder or otherwise to amend the law about murder would be likely tobe ruled out of order.F.E.
