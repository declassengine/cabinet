IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(69) 138 COPY NO.10th October, 1969CABINET64THE QUEEN&quot;11 S SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF parliament note by the Lord President of the CouncilOn 7th October I circulated for the information ox the Cabinet a draftof The Queen*o Speech on the Opening of Parliament prepared in the light of consideration by the Ministerial Committee on The Queen^s Speeches.    Ihave revised this to take account of the decisions reached in Cabinet on 7th and 9th October and now seek the approval of my colleagues to the draft annexed to this note.    Some drafting changes have also been made.2,      I have added to the draft references to Mineral Workings (OffshoreInstallations) (paragraph 14), Industrial Commission (paragraph 16), and housing Rents (paragraph 33),    I have sought to cover Trawler Safety byamendment of the paragraph about Merchant Shipping (paragraph 18), which already contained a reference to safety of fishermen.    This means that thedraft makes reference to all Bills in the main programme except investment grants for Shipss which it was agreed should not be mentioned,, andTransport (London) Acts 1969 (Amendment) which is a somewhat technicalmatter.3.      The reference to Local Government Reorganisation (Wales)(paragraph 31) has been recast in the form agreed at Cabinet last Tuesday.4.      We agreed Saafc Thursday that we would endeavour fco find room later in the Session for Civil Aviation and Registration of Employers and Self&quot;jSgj-Plpyed Persons in the Construction Industry.    It is for consideration whether reference should be made to them in the Speech,    I haveprovisionally recast the references - paragraphs 17 and 19 - In terms of proposals.    Considerations of length may tip the balance.5.      Legislation apart, the Cabinet will probably wish to look at the reference to Northern Ireland (paragraph 8).    It may be that there shouldbe some reference to the legislation proposed.
6,      The revised draft runs to about 990 words, compared with thenormal 1,000o    Any further additions will therefore need to be matched bydeletions,.T F privy Council Office, SSW,1010th October, 1969
