DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC I.IAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department i have now received a copy of the Report to the Northern ireland government of Lord Hunt&apos;s Advisory Board on the future of the royal ulster Constabulary and of the Ulster Special Constabulary,    In viewof the security issues involved I propose to report orally to the Cabineton the recommendations it contains,,2.       The two Governments have also received reports from four jointWorking Parties,    Three Working Parties have examined the extent towhich the Government of Northern Ireland&apos;s present practice or pledgedcommitments adequately ensure -(i)  The promotion of good community relations by methods includingthe prohibition of incitement to religious hatred,(ii)  The avoidance of any discrimination in any form of publicemployment,(iii)  The fair allocation of houses by public authorities.The fourth Working Party has assessed the economic and industrialprospects in Northern Ireland in the light of recent events.3,      I propose to visit Northern Ireland later this week to discusswhat action should follow from these five Reports.4.      The Working Party on Community Relations (which also hadadvice from officers of our Race Relations Board and community relations Commission) have produced three Bills: one to establish a Commissioner for Complaints, to investigate maladministration bylocal authorities and public boards;  one to establish a community relations Commission (on the model of our Commission); and oneto deal with incitement to religious hatred.    The first of these Billshas now been introduced and the second has been approved by theNorthern Ireland Cabinet for early introduction.    A Minister for community Relations has been appointed,    I understand that theC(69)1315th October, 19&amp;9CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND
Northern Ireland Government want to press on with the appointment ofthe Commissioner and members of the Commission, together v/ith their staff, in advance of the Bills completing their passage,.    The working party have also explored what to do about areas of discriminationoutside the public sector, and have recommended Government initiative in prescribing anti-discrimination clauses in Government contracts, andin seeking the co-operation of trade unions and employers to eliminateracial discrimination in private employment.    They have done a thoroughjob and, assuming their recommendations arc acceptable to the NorthernIreland Government, there is no other major issue I shall need to press.5q       The W or king Party on Public Employment have made a detailedreview of measures which could be taken in the Civil Service, localgovernment and statutory bodies.    The senior Civil Service is almostentirely Protestant for historical reasons.    The Catholics did not startcoming into the Civil Service in any numbers until 10 to 15 years ago.Northern Ireland officials do not accept that discrimination is practisedin the Civil Service but acknowledge that there is a thorough-goingpractice of discrimination in local authority recruitment and promotionespecially among lower levels of staff.6,       The Working Party&apos;s recommendations include the adoption ofmodel codes of practice by local authorities and public boards (to bemade available to employees and applicants for employment);  and theappointment of senior officials to supervise the application of the codeat lower levels.    They recommend an appeals machinery for bothrecruitment and promotion complaints against local authorities and statutory bodies.    This machinery will be within the purview of theCommissioner for Complaints, and the powers of the parliamentary commissioner for Administration will be extended to Civil Servicestaffing.    The Northern Ireland Government had already set in handarrangements to bring the machinery for Civil Service establishmentswork more in line v/ith ours but the Working Party have also recommended using outside members on recruitment boards.7.       I have maintained close contact with the Northern IrelandCommittee of the Irish Trades Union Congress, and I propose tofind out what help they would be willing to give to ensure thatappointments are made without regard to religion.8.      Apart from the appeals machinery, perhaps the mosthopeful long-term proposal is the Working Party Js recommendedstudy of a Public Service Commission to cover all employment inthe public sector.    I propose to endorse this.    I also propose to stress the importance of ensuring that the new machinery operates -and is seen to operate - effectively with manual and unskilled posts,since it is in this area that complaints of discrimination have been most widespread and are not seriously challenged.    Finally, sincemembership of the public boards themselves (which was outside theWorking Party&apos;s terms of reference) is so crucial to public confidence
in an impartial employment policy, I shall be inviting the Government toconsider the idea of an advisory panel, of balanced composition, whichcould be consulted by Ministers, about prospective appointments.9.       There is another aspect of this in which my colleagues can help.United Kingdom Departments employ numbers of staff in Northern Ireland,and I should bo glad if my colleagues would examine their Departments&apos;appointment and staffing procedures in relation to offices in NorthernIreland, so that no-one can accuse us of discrimination.    This isparticularly important for the Post Office, in view of the large numbersof staff employed there, and I shall be in touch separately with the newPost Office Board about this.10.       The Working Party on Housing Allocation have examined the model allocation scheme which the Northern Ireland Governmentrecommended to housing authorities daring the summer and whichis now being implemented by all but about six of the 65 housing authoritiesin the Province,    They endorsed the scheme as broadly satisfactory in achieving an impartial method of allocation.    But thio leaves the questionwhether the Roman Catholic minority will have sufficient confidence inthose who administer the scheme, and I asked our representative on theWorking Party to ensure that this received detailed consideration.    TheWorking Party have accordingly explored:(i)  Various measures which would leave responsibility for housingwith the local authorities but provide for some form of supervision - e, g*legislation to allow the Northern Ireland Government to appointCommissioners to take over the housing functions of authorities which are not performing them satisfactorily.(ii)  Legislation which would involve removing responsibilityfor housing from local authorities altogether, and giving them tothe Northern Ireland Government or to the Northern Ireland HousingTrust (a statutory and impartial body which commands general respect),11.       Northern Ireland Ministers will probably argue that, as only about 10 per cent of housing authorities are implicated in discriminationcharges, the allocation scheme and the appointment of a Commissionerfor Complaints (who will be competent to consider complaints ofmaladministration in the allocation of housing) will be sufficientto give confidence.    I do not accept this and I intend to ask that responsibility for housing should be transferred to the NorthernIreland Housing Trust.    I recognise that a decision to transfer responsibility for housing would have implications for the wholefuture of local government in the Province and that it might benecessary to examine this much wider question at the same time.Important and controversial proposals have already been published by the Northern Ireland Government which would involve reducingthe number of separately elected authorities from 73 to 17 authoritiesand the virtual removal from the new units of responsibility for health,
welfare, child care, education and public libraries.    Northern ireland government officials argue that responsibility for housing would raisethe question whether local government could continue in any recognisableform at all,,    I believe this to be greatly exaggerated.    Local authorities would still deal \v:th town and country planning, building bylaws, localroads and street lighting, sewerage and drainage, traffic management,cleansing and parks, among other things.12.       The Housing Trust at present owns 40,000 houses (localauthorities own 76,000), and the Trust has 30 regional officesthroughout Northern Ireland.    It is therefore well-placed, witha substantial additional effort, to extend its services to all publichouse building and allocation throughout Northern Ireland.    It isreluctant to do so because it fears it will become involved in politics,but if asked to take over, it will do so, subject to certain conditions.The conditions are that it will remain independent of political influence,both in the appointments of its Chairman and members and in subsequentmanagement;  and that the takeover should not be for an interim period(e. g. until the new local authorities come into existence in 1971).    the trust would also want to choose its own staff for its extended functions and not have to take over local authority staff now employed on this work.It seems to me that these are eminently reasonable requirements.13.       I shall run into a great deal of trouble over this proposal, as itwould take away housing from the local authorities to which NorthernIreland Ministers (and especially Mr. Faulkner) are committed.    but whatever system we settle for, it must be seen to be fair and giveconfidence to the minority.14.       The Economic Mission have reported that in the short term the disturbances have had less effect than might have been expectedon trade and employment; and virtually all the firms which suffered damage are now back in production.    The total bill for compensationis put at  11 million.     The longer-term effects are, however,potentially very serious.    Leaving aside the lose of tourist revenue,the principal threat is to the prospect of attracting new industrialdevelopment, upon which future economic progress largely depends,and a consequent worsening of an unemployixient rate which alreadyexceeds 7 per cent,15.      In this situation, the Northern Ireland Government propose the following immediate measures:(i) To introduce a scheme of free compensation to new investorsagainst the coot of any futtvre riot damage, includingconsequential loss.    This would fill certain gaps in theexisting arrangements for statutory compensation and isregarded as an essential step if there is to be any hope of attracting new investment.    Private insurance is unobtainable,SECRKT
(ii) To raise the level of investment grants by 5 per cent for a periodof three years,,(iii) To defer at any rate until 1971 the discontinuance of the selective Employment Tax 7s, 6d, repayment,(ii) and (iii) together would go some way to restore relative levels of inducement, which have been significantly eroded in recent years,(iv) To initiate a  2 million programme of labour-intensive works -on roads, forestry and land drainage - directed in particular atthe peak unemployment areas of the t/est,16,      I would regard all these measures as more than justified in thelight of the economic appraisal made by the officials of the sevenY/hitehall Departments who have been involved.    I understand thatthe Chancellor regards the Public Expenditure Survey Committeeconsequences as manageable.    As regards the compensation scheme,I would propose in any public announcement later this week to make clear Her Majesty&apos;s Governments continued intention to operatefinancial arrangements between the two Governments so as to cover the agreed capital requirements of the Northern Ireland Government.17,       The effectiveness of these measures is linked with the restorationof political stability and confidence.    Without being unduly pessimistic,however, and even assuming an easing of tension, I doubt whether they/ill prove sufficient to hold the employment position, still less ensurean acceptable rate of future economic progress, and more work must bedone on this problem.18,       Finally, we shall need to review the political and securityposition again.    I suggest that we should do this after my returnat the end of this week from my visit,JLj. J. home Office, S.Y/.1,5th October, 1969
