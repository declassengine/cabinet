(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)C(69)1336th October, 1969COPY NO.CABINETINDUSTRIAL policy note by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister, I am circulating to the Cabinetthe attached memorandum which has been prepared by a working party of officials in pursuance of the Cabinets decision at their last meeting(CC(69) 45th Conclusions, Minute 5).(Signed)  BURKE trend cabinet Office, S0 W. 1.6th October, 1969
ANNEXINDUSTRIAL policy the following notes examine certain issues arising from theCabinet,s discussion on 25th September of a possible merger betweenthe Monopolies Commission and the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI).    They concern:(i)  The future development of prices and incomes policy,(ii) The proposed legislation on rents,(iii) Arrangements for determining pay in the public sector,(iv) Ministers&apos; responsibilities for industrial efficiency in the public and private sectors.FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF PRICES AND INCOMES policy ,       The Cabinet have already agreed that from the end of 1969 prices and incomes policy should be based on the activation of Part II of the 1966Act which gives the Government power to delay pay settlements and priceincreaser for three months while the NBPI reports on them.    It will benecessary to publish a White Paper setting out guidelines which will formthe basis on which these matters are considered by the NBPI and theGovernment.    This can hardly be published - or the Order activatingPart II debated - until well into November, which means that any reference in The Queen&apos;s Speech to a merger between the Monopolies Commissionand the NBPI would precede it by some weeks.3.      In announcing the merger decision it would be necessary toexplain the relationship between the development of the prices and incomes policy and the establishment of the new Commission,    Inparticular the Government would have to be able to show that therewould be an orderly transition to the new basis for dealing with prices and incomes questions, in which the essential continuity of the policypursued in recent years was preserved,,    This would be important bothin order to avoid any impression that the activation of Part II, to whichthe Government are committed in the Letter of Intent to the international monetary Fund, was a mere formality; and in order to secure thecontinued co-operation of industry in operating the voluntary early warning system on price increases in the coming months.    It v/ouldalso be desirable to give industry some reassurance that in operatingthe new policy the Government would strike an appropriate balancebetv/een wage and price problems.
4,      An early decision would be needed on the scope of the powers to betaken under any legislation establishing a new Commission.    There is nothing inherent in the concept of a merged Commission to prevent theGovernment from retaining Part II type powers of delay over wages and prices.    But if Ministers decided not to incorporate in the new legislation(which unlike Part II would be permanent) any power to delay wage settlements it would be very difficult to retain any general power to delay price increases.    Any suggestion that the Government were proposing to retain detailed powers of price control while abandoningall control over incomes would arouse strong opposition in industry andmight well make it impossible to continue the present voluntary early warning arrangements, for example in the food trades, after the endof this year.    Industry would also resist strenuously the use of price control to prevent companies from adjusting prices to higher labour costswhen the pay settlements involved were not subject to control.5.       This does not mean that in the absence of any power to delay wage settlements all powers over prices would necessarily have to be dropped.Under existing legislation  he Government have power to control the priceof goods which have been the subject of an adverse report by the monopolies Commission.    It was assumed in C(69) 12?. that ministers would have available broadly the same power in respect of reports bya new Commission though its application might be of limited durationand restricted to cases where the Commission recommended that itwould be an appropriate remedy.6.      Industry would be likely to oppose strongly the retention of any power to control prices following reports by a new - and to manybusinessmen suspect - bodyj and this opposition would be intensifiedif the legislation provided that absolute size and not just monopoly could make companies liable for enquiry.    Indus try&apos;s attitude would be greatly influenced by their judgment of the Governments objectives in setting upa new Commission and of the circumstances in which the accompanyingpowers would be used0    It would be desirable to define these as closely as possible in any legislation and in particular to make it clear that itwould not be used as an instrument of general prices policy, in effectcontinuing Part II powers over prices.7.      More generally, there would be presentational problems involvedin making a transition, during 1970, from a prices and incomes policy basedon Part II of the 1966 Act to the new and much looser regime envisaged inC(69) 123,    A possible method of presentation might be on the lines that until the improvements in the balance of payments had been sustainedover a period the Government considered it necessary to continue onthe present lines with statutory powers to delay the implementation of wage settlements and price increases; for the longer term, however,it would be possible to move forward to a system in v/hich prices and incomes policy was subsumed in a more general framework for encouraging industrial efficiency and labour productivity; thePart II powers would accordingly run until the new legislationhad been enacted and the merged Commission had come into effective existence towards the end of 1970;  they would then lapse,
RENTS8.       The great majority of the legislation for the control of privaterents is of course permanent.    But certain provisions were includedin the 1968 Prices and Incomes Act which gave the Housing Ministersnew powers to require phasing of increases in private rents which are permitted under the Rent Act 1968, and also to control increases in rentsof local authority houses,,    These powers expire at the end of 1969, and part II of the 1966 Prices and Incomes Act does not apply to rents,9.      Cabinet agreed on 30th July (CC(69) $Oth Conclusions) that theHousing Ministers should explore with the Local Authority Associationsthe possibility of an agreement which Would limit increases in localauthority rents tc an average of 7s. 6d, a year and an individual maximum of 10s. Odo a year, with statutory powers in reserve.    The LocalAuthority Associations (but not the Greater London Council) havenow agreed to an arrangement of this kind, which was presented to them in the context of prices and incomes policy, until June, 1971.10,      A decision to establish a new Commission wh5.ch would take overthe present functions cf the NBPI would not in itself affect the question ofthe continuation of powers over rents.    Although the question of increases in local authority rents was on one occasion referred to the NBPI, it is unlikely that this would be done on a further occasion.    The NBPIrecommended guidelines for such increases which have now beenadopted.    It is therefore doubtful whether it would be necessary forthe possible scope of references to a new Commission to extend torents (although it might be presentationally awkward to exclude them).110       The agreement with the Local Authority Associations was concluded on the basis that it would form part of the prices and incomes policy after the end of 1969, the other features of which were still underconsideration.    If it appeared that the other aspects of the policy werebeing abandoned,, the Local Authority Associations would no doubt argue that the situation had changed, and that it would be wrong to single outrents alone for continued controls.    These arguments would not applyto the period during which Part II of the 1966 Prices and Incomes Actwas activated and it would be logical during that period to perate theagreement with the Local Authority Associations, accompanied byreserve statutory powers of control.12.       If, hov/ever, no similar prices and incomes powers were retained after the creation of a new merged Commission in the early autumn of 1970, and the special statutory powers of control over localauthority rents were ended at the same time, it would mean that thelegislation required to support the agreement v/ith the Local authority associations would have only a limited life.
13.      Whatever the decision on a new Commission, a very early decision is needed on the proposed rent legislation to accompany the agreement with the Local Authority Associations, since it will need to be passed by the end of 19690    In addition the Housing ministers are in favour of continuing the phasing of private rent increases.    this possibility was also envisaged by the Ministerial Sub-Committee on future Prices and Incomes Policy in May, 1969 (Pl(F)(69) 3rd Meeting).If the Cabinet were to decide in principle that legislation was needed tocontrol rent increases by local authorities and in the private sector, theHousing Ministers would be able quickly to put detailed proposals fox-consideration by the PI(F) Sub-Committee and, subsequently, theCabinet.PAY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR14.      In July, 1969, the Government announced that they had decidedthat the arrangements for determining pay in the public sector in itswidest sense should be more closely co-ordinated, that the revised arrangements would envisage giving the NBPI a more central role,and that any changes would be made in coacultation with those concerned.Since then, the PI(F) Sub-Committee has been consideiing precisely what changes should be made for this purpose and will be able to consider further proposals by officials after the Cabinet discussion on a possiblenew Commission.15.       The Pl(F) Sub-Committee agreed at its meeting on 31st July thatthere should be no change in the existing negotiating machinery which covers the greater part of the public services.    These include theindustrial and non-industrial Civil Service, teachers, police, nursesand most other National Health Service staff, local authority employees and the fire service.    This Pl(F) decision need not be affected by any decision on a new Commission.160       The PI(F) Sub-Committee agreed also that the NBPI should undertake periodic reviews of pay structures and efficiency in thepublic services which have existing negotiating machinery.    Thiswas subject to the reservation that before a review of any particular service was authorised, the agreement of the Ministers concerned wouldhave to be secured or a collective decision taken by the Government as awhole.    The decision was also based on the assumption that the role ofthe NBPI was not materially changed.    No decision has been taken onthe precise nature of these reviews, the machinery for conducting them,the groups to be reviewed or the timing of the reviews.    These questions will need to be considered by the PI(F) Sub-Committee after the cabinet discussion.    In the report by officials circulated with C(69) 122, it was assumed that if a new Commission were set up it would conduct reviewed/sof this kind and it would be consistent with the Cabinet decision of July,1969, to entrust it with the responsibility for public sector reviewed/s.However, if Ministers decide upon the new Commission, this aspect of its functions v/ill need further study.
17,      At the present time, there are standing references to the NBPI onthe pay of the Armed Forces and of university teachers - two groups for whom no negotiating machinery exists at present, though the possibilityof creating such machinery for the university teachers is under discussion.These standing references could be transferred to the new Commission,leaving open (as at present) the possibility of withdrawing or alteringeither of them at any time a    The position of the Kinder sley Review body on the Pay of Doctors and Dentists and the Plowden Committee on the pay of the Higher Civil Service within the general framework for dealing v/ithpublic sector pay has not yet been discussed by Ministers,    A decision to change the arrangements in these fields could not be taken without full discussion with the interests concerned.    Even if a new Commissionsimply took over the NBPI&apos;s powers, the announcement of its establishmentwould arouse suspicion in the medical profession, which could be allayedonly by making it clear av the time of the announcement that the Kinder sleyReview Body would not be affected,18,      It is unnecessary to decide whether a new Commission should begiven specific responsibilities in other sensitive areas of the public sector.    The NBPI has been given responsibility for advising fromtime to time in some of these fields (e, g. Chairmen and Boards ofthe nationalised industries),,    It would be sufficient if the terms ofreference of a new Commission were drawn widely enough to enablereferences to be made where Ministers considered it desirable,19,       There is no need for Ministers to take decisions immediately on any of the questions outstanding in this section;  but if any public statement were made about the establishment of a new Commission,it would need to include a passage in suitable terms to reassure suchgroups as the medical profession that the new organisation did not imply any change in the arrangements for advice on their pay,MINISTERS&apos; RESPONSIBILITIES FOR INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY20,      At the discussion in Cabinet on 25th September there was generalagreement that if there were a merger of the Monopolies Commission andthe NBPI it should not involve any &quot;derogation from the existing powersand responsibilities of sponsoring Ministers to stimulate efficiency andregard for the public interest in industries for which they are responsible in the public and private sectors of the economy&quot;,21.       Production departments  relations v/ith the industries theysponsor play a central role in the Governments industrial policies,In the public sector the Ministers concerned have direct responsibilityfor important aspects of the nationalised industries&apos; activiti.es and areaccountable to Parliament for them.    In the private sector, relationsbetween the production Departments and their industries have become very much closer in recent years.    There is a growing dialogue with individual companies and the Working Party on Industrial Policy (MCW)v/ill shortly be submitting a report to Ministers on how consultationsbetween Departments and large companies might be strengthened andsystematised,
22.      It would be important in defining the functions of a new Commissionto recognise that formal enquiries are only one aspect of the complex of relations between Government and industry,,    They are in no way a substitute for, nor must they be allowed to prejudice, the maintenance and development of the less formalised dealings with sponsorDepartmentSo    They are an additional tool to supplement andreinforce Departments where a detailed outside enquiry maybe needed to establish whether a firm is acting in the publicinterest or where an independent report on certain practicesmight be more effective than informal consultation and pressure.To the extent that the scope of a new Commission appeared to industryto go significantly beyond a continuation of current developments in theworking of the two existing bodies, there could be a serious withdrawalof confidence.    Moreover, if any new arrangements could be interpreted as reducing the relative importance oi the sponsor&quot; Department in theGovernments dealings with industry large companies might attach less importance to the development of the two-way contacts which it is theGovernments aim to encourage.23.      These are not new problems.    They exist wherever a body whichis responsible to one Minister has powers of enquiry or action in a fieldcovered by other Ministers, as is the case with the monopolies commission, the NBPI and the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation.Experience suggests that so far as formal machinery is concerned thebest arrangement is for references to bs made jointly by the minister responsible for the body carrying out the enquiiy and the productionMinister concerned.    These would follow agreement between the two ministers concerned or collective decision.    In many cases, indeed,the sponsor Department might suggest references.    The responsibilityfor follow-up action in the private sector would be shared with theproduction Department taking the lead wherever practicable.Responsibility for follow-up action in the public sector would rest with the sponsor Department concerned.24.      Ministers have still to consider the precise arrangementsfor referring increases in charges by nationalised industries in thenext phase of the prices and incomes policy.    Officials are generally agreed that more flexibility is desirable in deciding whether or not itwould be useful to make a reference in a particular case.    enquiries into the efficiency of the nationalised industries raise special problems and consideration is already being given to the way in which efficiencystudies can be so carried out as to be of real assistance to the industries and Ministers concerned.    It is particularly desirable to developarrangements which the industries can see as contributing to management rather than as providing an additional basis for public criticism.    Ministers responsible for the industries will wish to retain some flexibility in the means available to them for discharging their duty to promote efficiency, but with the opportunity now provided to reviewcurrent procedure, the new body could make a contribution.25.      The principles in this section would apply, mutatis mutandis, toDepartmental responsibilities in relation to pay in the public sector.
