IhIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.   6 7CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION IN wales memorandum by the Secretary of State for wales the Minister of Housing and Local Government has been asked toconsider the implications for England if we were to introduce in the 1969-70Session a Bill to reorganise local government in Wales on the lines of theWhite Paper &quot;Local Government in Wales&quot; iue, to create a system of sixcounty councils, 35 district councils and three county boroughs.    Iunderstand that he foresees the following main difficulties?-(a) There would be embarrassment for English Departments in negotiating a Maud-type unitary system based on authorities ofnot less than 250, 000 population if Wales were to legislate for a two-tier system with authorities of smaller size than Maud*sminimum,,(b) The retention of three county boroughs In Wales would be embarrassing since it would conflict with the principle of joiningtown and country.In the light of this, he suggests that I should reconsider my proposals atleast for South Wales and that The Queen*s Speech should contain no greatercommitment than that studies are being pressed forward in reorganisationin all three countries of Great Britain.    This suggestion present s mewith serious difficulties and I would like to comment on his propositions.The embarrassment to England if Wales has two tiers and some authorities of less than 250,0002.      I make two points here,,    First, it has been implicit ever since we decided to have a Royal Commission for England and to publish separateproposals in a White Paper for Wales that we were agreeable toreorganisation in the two countries proceeding on different lines.    I cannot see any necessary embarrassment if Wales, England and Scotland eachadopts different solutions best suited to their own circumstances.    Indeed-tlwC(69)1283rd October, 1969
at the Local Government Reorganisation Committee last month there was general agreement that so long as there was a common philosophy of approach it was right that the local government systems of all three countries should differ having regard to differences in historical tradition,geography, population and communications.3.      Second, so far as North and mid-Wales is concerned there is nodoubt that what the White Paper proposes is the right and whollyjustifiable solution.    A Maud-type solution simply will not work in these areas sinces-(a) All but Clwyd are very large in area compared with Maud*s Englishunits and probably have v/orse communications.(b) Unlike the Maud units of comparable area &quot; Norwich and Norfolk,York, Northumberland - they have no experience of large-scalecounty government.(c) Unlike these Maud areas they contain (except for Clwyd) no sizeabletowns to form centres for a unitary government.    For day to daypurposes, the local authority services will need to be administered from a number of small towns.These are perfectly understandable differences of circumstances and i cannot see that they need cause embarrassment to my English colleagues.4,      The difficulties as I see them arise only in South Wales and theyturn basically on the problem of the county boroughs with which I now deal.Town and country50      I recognise that the retention of the three County Boroughs ofCardiff9 Newport and Swansea is seen as an embarrassment by the Englishdepartments since it might be held to perpetuate differences between townand country.    But every solution, to be viable, must meet the needs of thearea concerned and the topographical and social circumstances ofSouth Wales are exceptional.    It is an area with a series of long valleyswith distinct separated communities which dees not lend itself at allreadily to the socio-geographical unitary pattern proposed for England.I have looked carefully at a variety of possible &quot;Maud11 type patterns for south Walec but I have been unable to arrive at any which could in my view be guaranteed to lead to a better and more acceptable system than theWhite Paper,6.      None of the three towns is particularly large by English standards.They certainly do not approach city region scale.    Two of them haverecently had major boundary extensions.    Moreover the proposal whichI am at present considering for a major growth point at Llantrisant usisigNew Town machinery would make it difficult at this time to draw a betterboundary between Cardiff and the valleys.** 2***
7.       Whilst therefore I do not dissent from the general principle I believethat there is a good case for exception in South Wales and the extent of theexception is so limited as hardly to affect the issue in the large urbandominated areas of England,,    Nevertheless In order to minimise anyembarrassment which my colleagues might feel, I should reluctantly beprepared to include provision in the Welsh legislation for me to review the boundaries of the three County Boroughs at a later date.    There are obvious objections to introducing further uncertainty in the very legislation designedto bring a lasting solution; but if it would help my colleagues I would accept it.8.      I therefore feel entitled to ask my colleagues to accept that legislation on the lines of our White Paper for Wales need not be an embarrassment to them in their consideration of English and Scottishreorganisation? and to agree to my introducing a Bill on these lines in thenext Session.    It is essential that drafting work should start without delayif we are to have a Bill ready on time.The implications of delay9.      As a Government we stated in our White Paper in 1967 that we had decided to proceed with the reorganisation therein described (rather thanremitting it to the Royal Commission) because the need for early action was particularly urgent in Wales; and because the considerable work already done made it apparent that local government could be reorganised on lines which would secure its early strengthening.10.      In the intervening two years we have engaged in an exhaustive seriesof discussions with virtually every local authority in Wales and with thelocal authority associations.    As a result preparatory work in the legislation is far advanced and this is widely known.    Although there has never been any public commitment to legislation in 1969&quot;70 there is general expectation that a Bill will be introduced next Session.    E we do not now proceed weshall be exposed to widespread criticism and risk forgoing much of the goodwill that our efforts have won for us.    To say that we cannot find timefor a Bill will produce the certain response that despite all ourprotestations about concern for Wales, the need for urgent action and so on,when it comes to the point of acting, we have more important things to dealwith.    One short Act - the Welsh Language Act, 1967, will have been our only exclusively Welsh piece of legislation in this ParliamentAlternatively if we explain our failure to legislate in 1969-70 by referenceto the need to study further the situation in South Wales where half the Welshpopulation live, we shall be told that at the end of the day the Governmentdemand that Wales should fall in line with the recommendations of an EnglishRoyal Commission which had no knowledge of Wales, made no study of itand formulated proposals relating wholly to English conditions.-3-
11.       These are not agreeable alternatives.    I am convinced that on everyground the sensible course is to proceed with a Bill on the lines of theWhite Paper in the 1969&quot;&apos;70 Session.    I invite my colleagues to agree tothis course.G.T.Welsh Office, S. W.I.3rd October, 1969i-4-
