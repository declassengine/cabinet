C(69) 153 COPY NO,__6318th November,) 1969CABINETABUSE OF SOCIAL SECURITYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services and theFirst Secretary ox State and Sec.reta.vy of State for employment and ProductivityDuring the last few weeks there has been a marked renewal of criticism both in the Press and in Parliament of abuse of the social security system.    Some of this criticism no doubt springs from politicalmotives, bufc thei-e is evidence of widespread, if ill-informed, disquietamong the public at large,, among staff in the local offices of ourDepartments^ and even our own supporters,2,      Recent criticism has concentrated mainly on abuse of stipplementarybenefits I but malpractices are by no means confined to that field and fromtime to time abuses of national insurance attract attention.    Listed beloware some of the most common forms in both fields,(-)    Abuse of National Insurance(a) Drawing unemployment benefit while working on the side(&quot;signing and working&quot;)a    This is a matter for the Department ofEmployment and Productivity and there is probably nothing that can be done about it without more staff for more searchinginve stigation,(b) Whole or partial avoidance of contribution liability by employersand employees, especially in the const ruction industry,,(c) Receipt of unemployment benefit by well-to-do occupational pensioners who have no real intention of resuming work,(d) Malingering in order to claim sickness benefit.    There is no evidenceof pure malingering among the long-term sick.    There are alreadyspecial measures,, which are adopted as necessary from time totime, for checking on people who claim frequently for short periodsand for trivial complaints8 or at times of strikes or paid andpublic holidays,-1-IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)
(^)    Abuse of Supplementary Benefit(a) Settling back on supplementary benefit when the claimant is capableof work and could find work if he tried hard enough,,(b) As with unemployment benefit^, working on the side and not disclosingearnings,(c) Collusive or fictitious desertion in order to qualify for benefit.(d) Evasion of the rule which forbids payment of benefit to womenco-habiting with a man not himself eligible for benefit,,(e) Squandering of benefit with the result that further payments haveto be made in order to avoid acute hardship,,Measures already taken in the field of supplementary benefits3a      As a result of the great upsurge in the number of claimants betweenAugust^ 1966 and December, 1967 the staff handling supplementary benefitclaims were very severely stretched and both the quantity and the quality of the checks suffered,.    We are nows however,, recovering from this situation as the following figures shows-1967     1963     1969 (first half)Prosecutions for fraudulentlyclaiming supplementary benefitCases handled by SpecialInvestigatorsAllowances teirminated or reduced as a result ofinvestigationAnnual rate of recovery inliable relative cases(iBe0 follow-up and enforcement of maintenance allowances)2,2113, 6779S700 13,000    7.0004.300    69 0003,300At July, 1963About  5,, 000, 000NowOver  6, 000, 000Further, as the general situation has improved it has been possible to devote more staff effort to the policing of the supplementary benefitscheme.    For example,, the number of special investigators looking out,mainly, for collusive desertion and c cohabitation and undisclosed earningshas been increased to nearly 200*   As a result of a deliberate change ofpractices, approved by Ministers, the Supplementary Benefits commission have made and will continue to make8 a b*g drive on &quot;layabouts&quot; deliberately-seeking to live on supplementary benefit.    Since JulyP 1968 there has been***2**
a rule that after four weeks of unemployment, supplementary benefit, willnot be paid to single unskilled men under 45 capable of work and living in areas where work is available, if it appears that the continuingunemployment is voluntary,.    Since then 80, 000 allowances have beenterminated within the four weeks and a considerable proportion of theseterminations can be attributed to the rule.    The Commission have alsodeveloped a system under which all other unemployed people who are fitand under 45 are interviewed after three months (if this has not happenedbefore; e.ga wage-stopped cases are interviewed after seven weeks)?  andtheir benefit can be terminated if this is appropriate.4.      Measures to date have therefore been far from unsuccessful but clearly it would reassure the public if additional ones could be announced..The Supplementary Benefits Commission are already well, aware that thewhole Supplementary Benefits Scheme could become discredited if theywere thoxight to be complacent about abuse and it is proposed to discuss with them the possibilities of further tightening up in administration,e, g, extending to married men without children and to single menbetween 45 and 50 the four weeks rule now applied to single men under 45.Further measures in the Supplementary Benefit and Insurance Fields5.      Any greater stringency in the administration of the supplementary benefits Scheme is unlikely to produce striking results.    Moreover thereare other fields in which public concern is being expressed^    For these reasons and to show that the Government are determined to tackle problemsof abuse and misuse seriously we consider that the Government should(a) make certain changes in the law relating to supplementary benefit in the industrial field? and(b) make changes in the conditions under which comfortably-offoccupational pensioners can claim unemployment benefit,,These (which are discussed below) and any changes which the supplementary benefits Commission may be willing to makes should be announced as apackage when the National Superannuation Bill is published.    The reasonfor this is that the Bill will draw attention to the position of strikersbecause it will contain two provisions^ which we have already decided upon,,favourable to the trade unions, namely -(i) to limit the disqualification for unemployment benefit and supplementary benefit (which have always been in identical terms)where employment is lost as a result of a strike to thoseparticipating in it or directly interested in the disputeo    (At presentthe disqualification also extends (l) to people who are &quot;financing&quot;the dispute - for practical purposes this means belonging to a tradeunion which is financing the strike and (2) to people who belong to agrade or class any member of which is participating in . directlyintex-ested ina or financing the dispute)*
(ii) to legalise the practice whereby income tax refunds and strike payreceived by persons disqualified for unemployment benefit as aresult of a strike are disregarded^, up to the level of the claimantssown requirements (at present  4 per week) in determining theamount of benefit payable for his family.Changes in lav/ relating to supplementary benefit in the industrial fieldA.      Payment of benefit to strikers after return to work6.      A recent development which may fairly be called a misuse of the supplementary Benefits Scheme is the growth in the practice of relyingexclusively on supplementary benefit, instead of obtaining advancea ofwages (subs) when the strike is over and the men are back at work.    Thebenefit then payable differs from that payable when on strike in that it isobtainable by single men? it covers the married. strxker% own requirements as well as those of his family^ and income tax refunds aretotally disregarded,,    (Also,, like all supplementary benefit^ it is not taxed).As a result there is frequently a sharp rise in the family income of strikerswho have been on supplementary benefit durmg the strike.7.      It was National Assistance Board (NAB) practice, aati has continuedto be the practice of (he Supplementary Benefits Commission^ to put pressure on employers^ early in a strike^ to agree to pay subs on the returnto work, and until a few years ago employers in general agreed to do so.It seems hov/ever in the last year or two to have become more generallyrealised that it is to the strikers&apos; advantage to press their employers notto make advances8 which are sraparf aW.e5 so that fe&amp;y       ottfaansupplementary benefit in full, which is not.    There was a particularlyclear example in the Ford strike earlier this yeare when some of theCornpany*s plants originally agreed to give subs but withdrew underpressure from the workers at one plant.    During the three weeks of thatstrike there were 18.300 payments to 12P 360 claimants at a Cost of 104^ 000.    In the two weeks f following the return to work 14, 600 payments were made at a cost of  7Sa0Q0.    Similarly^ at the end of the recent miners-strike, National Coal Board (NCB) Headquarters gave instructions that nosubs were to be paids although in the region principally involved the localNCB management agreed to give subs of  4.    The total paid out in benefitafter that strike had ended was  446, 000; during the strike the total was 123,000.    The corresponding figures for some major strikes in the last few years are set out in the annex,,8.      We have considered whether to recommend to our colleagues thatthis situation should be brought to an end by legislation providing that unless he could prove urgent needj a striker could net receive benefit for himself and his family after he had returned to work and was awaiting his wages.This would be altogether too drastic a cures it would cause the most hostile reaction from the unions, on a number of grounds *- that it was vindictive;that if employers did not give subs, or gave inadequate subss the strikers&quot;
families could be in real want? and that it was unfair that the strikershould be denied benefit both at the beginning of a strike and after its end.It could lead to considerable practical difficulty in that local staff of theDepartment of Health and Social Security would have to examine largenumbers of &quot;urgent need&quot; claims, to decide which claims were genuine,and to assess the amount of benefit, a difficult enough process at thecalmest of times, in what could be a sensitive situation,,    It would in anycase be likely to cause real hardship^ particularly among the lower paid workers who would have little in the way of tax refunds or savings to tidethem over until they receive their wages, and who would find it difficultto repay any subs and any supplementary benefit they had received,9.      We propose accordingly a compromise under which a striker, onreturn to work, would be entitled to benefits on exactly the same basis as during the strike, that is he would be paid for his dependants only, his taxrefund and other personal resources being taken into account, subject tothe  4 disregard, in assessing the amount.    This would reduce the amount paid out at the end of a strike, (it is estimated that if the basis of assessment proposed had been in operation at the end of the miners1strike the amount paid in benefit would have been about  250,000 insteadof the  446,000 actually paid)., would be simple to administer, and wouldbe much less objectionable to the trade unions,, who seem indeed unawarethat, on the return to work, supplementary benefit is assessed on a more generous basis than during the strike,,B.      Payment of benefit in cases of industrial misconduct, etc,10.      We propose also a change in the legislation which deals with thosewho are dismissed for industrial misconduct, or leave their employment or refuse suitable employment without good cause, and have therefore beendisqualified for up to six weeks for unemployment benefit,    If such personsestablish a claim to supplementary benefit, the benefit is normally reducedby 15s,, but no more, while the disqualification lasts.    But this reduction is from scales which (with the payment for rent added) are now at such a level that a man who is not disqualified, but is eligible for supplementary benefit, draws only 15s, more per week than a comparable man who isdisqualified.    A deduction of that order is derisory and ineffective,110       We recommend accordingly that the penalty should be increased,the claimants requirements, and those of his wife if he has one, beingassessed at one-third less than the normal scale rate, rent and therequirements of any children being met in full.    Thus, for example, a married man with two children under 11 and rent of  2, 5, 0, , on beingdisqualified for  10. 6. 0. in flat rate unemployment benefit would receivesupplementary benefit of  9.18, 0, instead of  11.15., 0, as at present(the full requirement of  12.10, 0. less 15s. ).    It is estimated that theincreased penalty proposed would save up to  f million a year.-5-
120       Clauses to give effect to these two proposals - A0 and BB above *?could be introduced at Committee stage, though the intention so to legislatewould be made clear when the Bill was published (see paragraph 5%    Itwillj, of course, be necessary to inform the Trades Union Congress (TUC)and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) of these intentions beforethe announcement is made,    (They know already of the decision to legalise the current disregard of tax refunds,, etc.).Unemployment benefit for occupational pensioners13,      We propose that regulations should be made to restrict the paymentof unemployment benefit to certain occupational pensioners,    The cabinet approved such a proposal in. principle in March last year(CC(68) 17th Conclusions),    Draft regulations were subseqtiently referred for consideration to the National Insurance Advisory Committees whosereport was recently received^   Except for Lord Collisong they support theregulations.    But their introduction will provoke some criticism and theCabinet should know in little more detail what they will amount to0140      When the Advisory Committee were asked to consider this question in 1966, because of mounting public concern about people who retire with substantial occupational pensions and then claim unemployment benefitwithout any real intention of taking another job, they recommended thatsuch pensioners should have to satisfy additional conditions for benefit^notably a requaliflcation test (six months new employment after giving up their old job) if they had a pension of  15 per week or more, and (inevery case) reduction of benefit on a sliding scale if fchey had a pension of 5 or more,    (People who did not pass the requalJfication test would havefree &quot;credits&quot; of insurance contributions withheld as well as unemploymentbenefit).    The draft regulations which we put forward raised these figures to  18 and  6,10,, 0, respectively^ and introduced a minimum age of 58below which they would not operate.    The Committee, who received over3r000 representations on the regulations^ have now recommended that dielevels should be further raised to  20 and  10,    (Their report has not yetbeen published),15.      Lord Coilison, who reflects the views of the TUC^ has from the start opposed these additional conditions on the ground that they breach theprinciple of benefit as of righfcc    He has attracted vigorous support fromthe unions representing those affected.    We shall not therefore have an easy run if we make substantive regulations? nor, if it could be avoided^would we wish at this time to irritate the occupational pensioner interestsfurther.    But, like the Committee, we are satisfied that there is no otherrealistic way of tackling this abuse by the better-off y and we cannot ignoreit.    We think,, however,, that we must liberalise the proposed rules stillmore if they are to be made palatable, to our ov/n side,    Y/hat we propose isto disregard all occupational pensions up to age 60 instead of 58$  to adopta requalification test level of  25 instead of  20$ and to raise the sliding scale threshold to  15 iasfcead of  10,    Where no lump sum was payable r
anyone getting a half^pay pension based on a final salary of  le 500 a year would not have his unemployment benefit reduced, and a person would nothave to pass a requalification test unless he had a half-pay pension basedon a final salary of  2,500 a year.    Lump sums paid as part of the occupational pension would be disregarded altogether if they were receivedbefore the regulations came into operation, but if received afterwards theywould be taken into account for the succeeding 10 years at one-&quot;tenth of their annual value - e.g0 a lump sum of  500 would be treated as equivalent toan addition of  1 to the weekly pension,,    It is estimated that this could result in a saving of about  3 million a year in public expenditure ascompared with the saving of  4 million a year which was taken into account in public expenditure on the basis of the original proposalsa15,      We invite our colleagues to agree that(i) an informal approach should be made to the supplementary benefits Commission on the lines indicated in paragraph 4;(ii) at Committee stage, clauses should be moved increasing the penalty for industrial misconduct and enabling the Minister tomake regulations as to the assessment of benefit for strikers1families after the end of a strike (paragraph 12)j(iii) regulations should be made-dealing with well-to-do occupational pensioners (paragraphs 13&quot;*15);(iv) the measures described above and the outcome of the approach to the Commission should be announced as a package of measuresto control abuse, shortly after the National Superannuation Billis published (paragraph 5);(v) the TUC and CBI should be informed before the announcementis made (paragraph 12),R.0 M0 Se C0B0AoC0Department of Health and Social Security, S.E01017th November, 1959-7-
