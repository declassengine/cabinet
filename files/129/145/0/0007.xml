IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 132 COPY NO,        fi 76th October, 1969CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME; SESSION 1969-70Memorandum by the Lord President of the council the Future Legislation Committee has reviewed the programme for1969-70 approved provisionally by the Cabinet in April(CC(69) 19th Conclusions) In the light of developments since then and the load on drafting resources.    Policy decisions are still awaited on certain important Bills, and it is clear that the severe pressure to which dx*aftingresources are already exposed will Intensify in the coming months.Drafting is likely to be a more limiting factor than Parliamentary time.Main Programme20      Having considered the progress made with the Bills in the listprovisionally approved in April and the various additions to the main programme which have since been approved or proposed, the future legislation Committee recommends that the main programme should consist of the following Bills -AgricultureEducation (Comprehensive Schools)Safety and Health in IndustryNational Superannuation axld Social InsuranceDrugsAdministration of JusticeFamily LawElectricity Industry ReorganisationGas Industry ReorganisationAtomic Energy Act (Amendment)Merchant ShippingAssistance to Intermediate AreasPorts ReorganisationLocal Authority and Allied Personal Social ServicesEqual PayInvestment Grants for ShipsTrawler SafetyMineral Workings (Off-Shore Installations)Transport (London) Act, 1969 (Amendment)-1-
3.      Basically this is the April list; but Productivity Consultants and national Health and Related Services have been excluded, since neither isnow wanted this Session; and we have omitted meantime (since policy is unlikely to be settled for some time) Registration of Employers and Self-Employed Persons in the Construction Industry, subject to review in thelight of drafting resources and Parliamentary time once policy has been determined.    We have added Equal Pay, Investment Grants for Ships,Transport (London) Act, 1969 (Amendment) and Trawler Safety (a short Billlate in the Session to contain provisions implementing the Holland-MartinReport which cannot be ready soon enough for inclusion in MerchantShipping) and have transferred Mineral Workings (Off^Shore Installations)from the Second Reading Committee list.4.      Substantial progress has been made on the drafting of Agriculture,Education (Comprehensive Schools), Administration of Justice, Family Law,Merchant Shipping and Assistance to Intermediate Areas.    All of these should be ready for introduction at or soon after the start of the Session,Drafting is in progress in most of the other cases, but cannot yet begin onDrugs, Local Authority and Allied Personal Social Services, Equal Pay orTrawler Safety,,5.      There remain five important Bills whose inclusion in the main programme depends on decisions yet to be taken by the Cabinet.    Nodrafting can be undertaken meantime and work on these Bills, if approved,will have to be done during the winter months when drafting resources willbe most stretched,,    The Bills are Industrial Relations, IndustrialCommission, Housing Rents, Civil. Aviation and Local government reorganisation (Wales).6.      The Cabinet have already begun to consider policy on industrial relations and Industrial Commission and policy on Housing Rents canconveniently be considered in the same context.    Policy recommendations on Civil Aviation will shortly be put before Cabinet.    Local government reorganisation (Wales) has been under consideration In the ministerial committee on Local Government Reorganisation and is the subject of aseparate recommendation on policy from that Committee,7.      The fact that policy decisions are still outstanding on these majortopics creates serious problems for the management of the legislative programme and the allocation of drafting resources.    The future legislation Committee concluded that it should be possible to find room inthe main programme (in addition to a short Bill on Housing Rents $f needed)for two - but probably only two - out of Industrial Relations, IndustrialCommission and Civil Aviation.    Local Government Reorganisation (Wales)would be a long Bill of about 100 clauses.    Given drafting priority itspreparation would occupy drafting resources for five months.    It wouldoverlap the busiest period in the Parliamentary Counsels Office and mighteither suffer delay itself or impose delay on several other important Bills.The Future Legislation Committee took the view that its retention in theprogramme would necessitate afull reappraisal and  ae.dropping of other Bills.&quot;2.-
Contingent Bills8,       Of the Bills listed in April, it is now known that Guyana republic and Coal will be required0    Merchant Shipping Act (1894) Amendmenthas been added to the list.Re serve Sills9.       The Future Legislation Committee recommends that the reservelist of Bills, to be drafted and introduced when opportunity offers, should consist of -Local Authorities (Goods and Services)AnimalsIndustrial Training Act (Amendment)Radiological protection and that Water Resources Act, 1963 (Amendment), Compensation forInjurious Affection, Interpretation of Statutes and Re sealing of ScottishConfirmations should be added if and when fchey secure policy approval.Essential Bills, Second Reading Committee BillSj Supplementary Bills10.       These lists (as repi*produced Sa the Annex ic this paper) remain asprovisionally approved in Aprils except that (i) Mineral Workings (Off-Shore Installations) has been transferred from the Second reading committee list to the main programme, (ii) Animals ha3 been transferred from the supplementary list to the reserve list and (iii) Mineral WorkingRights has been added to the supplementary list.Conclusion11.
