C(69) 137 COPY NOB jjjj14th October,, 1969CABINETFUEL POLICY AND ASSISTANCE FOR THECOAL IBSDUSTRYMemorandum by the Minister of technology the Prime Minister in. October, 1968 invited Hie Minister without portfolio as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on Industrial policy to arrange a review of the assumptions which formed the basis of the fuel policy laid out in the White Paper on Fuel Policy (Cmnd0 3438) published in November, 1967.    The Committee considered the outcome of this review together with certain proposals for the continuation of assistance to thecoal industry put forward by the former Minister of Power.    Theconclusions and proposals set out below have been endorsed by theCommittee.    I myself have now examined these proposals; and i recommend them to my colleagues,,General fuel policy2a      The general policy laid down in the 1967 White Paper was that theGovernment should aim to provide energy at the lowest total cost to thecommunity &quot;having regard to the whole range of relevant considerations -economic and social - and to national and regional economic policies&quot;.The major constraint then operating on fuel policy was the problem ofreadjustment of the coal industry.3,      Studies carried out over the last year have confirmed the validity of the Governments primary objectives and the assumptions and judgmentsunderlying our earlier statement of fuel policy.    In particular, the coal situation now appears to be more manageable than for some years pastssupply and demand are now about in balance9 and morale in the industry has been maintained.    Nevertheless, the problems of the coal industry will continue to play an important part in our fuel policy for some years yet0For this reason we should maintain the ban on imports of coal and on the .conversion of power stations from coal^burning to oil or natural gas; takecontingency powers to ensure additional coal-burn at power stations if($DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)
necessary and to reimburse the National Coal Board (NCB) for the deferment of colliery closures at the Governments request? and continueto contribute to the social costs of the coal industry*s contraction and to compensate redundant mine worker s0    These proposals, which are dealtwith at greater length in paragraphs 6-13 below, form a package whichshould enable us to secure the continued effective co-operation of management and men in the further unavoidable contraction of the coalIndustry,4,      Some consideration has also been given to the general context of fuel policye    In 1968 the net foreign exchange cost of the energy accountwas  390 million, and despite the savings which will arise from natural gas this is expected to Increase to about  420 million In 1970 and 620 million in 1975,    However, the major part of the increase Is infields (e6g. transport) where there is no practicable substitute for oil0It would be possible to pursue a coarse In the energy sector primarily concerned with foreign exchange saving and which theoretically would leadto a substantial balance of payments advantage    But if pursued beyond acertain point this would cause such distortions throughout the economythat the costs Involved would in practice damage our long-term positionand stand in the way of8 rather than assist., our efforts towards rectifyingthe balance of payments situation and improving our internationalcompetitiveness.    It is necessary to strike a balance here     Existingprotection and taxation measures in the energy sector already producesubstantial foreign exchange savings and to do more could only be justifiedin the context of a general reshaping of our balance of payments policies.In the absence of any general change of this sort, the assumptionsunderlying the 1967 statement on fuel policy still sfand.5,      This means that the coal Industry must still to a large extentdominate our fuel policy for both industrial and regional policy reasons.Although we are over the hump of the manpower rundown, the position bothnationally and In particular regions must continue to be watched.    Coalsupply and demand are now roughly In balance^, and it ib Important that theNCB should be given the clear task of maintaining this balance without special coal-burn at power stations.    This precludes endorsing the NCB*sspecific and publicly stated planning objectives, Including sales of135 million tons in 1975,    (in tecenfc private discussion with the Ministryof Power, the NCB have in fact retracted their earlier demand for theGovernment to endorse the induotryrs present objectives, though they arelikely to maintain them in public at least for the time being)0    But weshould encourage the NCB to work for the highest practicable productivity and should tell them that,, subject to continuing review, a manpowerrundown of 10 per cent a year seems to the Government about right inpresent circumstances.- 2**
6.      Tfu-j specific proposals fall into two classes3 fchose which require legislation (social support measures, contingency provision for increasedcoal-burn and compensation for the deferment of colliery closures) andfchose which can be implemented administratively (the bans on coal imports and on the conversion of coal-fired power stations).Assistance to the coal industry(a)   Social measures70      We must continue to give social help to the coal industry when thepresent arrangements end.    K we do not, we must look forward to aworsening of our regional problems and we may damage morale or evenrisk industrial unrest in the coal industry.    The provisions of theCoal Industry Act, 1967 expire at the end of March, 1971 and legislation will be needed In the forthcoming Session if the scheme is to be continued.At present, social help is given in the form of the Redundant Mineworkers*Scheme and the subsidisation of social payments made by the NCB.    the ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy concluded that in principlethese measures should be extended for three years beyond March, 1971.They inclined to the view that support should be continued at current raS:es.But recognising the need to contain public expenditure they asked officials to consider ways of tapering off expenditure on these measures after 1971;the report by officials is annexed to this paper.(i) The Redundant Mineworkers1 Scheme and Premature Pensions8.      At present^ this scheme provides that mineworkers aged 55 or overwho are made redundant receive up to about 90 per cent of their take-homepay for three years or until they reach age 65 if this is earlier.    Once thethree-year period has elapsed they are paid their Mineworkers Pensionprematurely.    The full cost of this Scheme and associated early pensionsfalls on the Exchequer, and under the 1967 Act: will total some  40 milliongrossp or  22 million net if account is taken of social security benefits notpaid to which they would otherwise be entitled,    E the Scheme is extendedin its present form until March, 1974 the additional cost (includingpremature pensions) will be  12.9 million gross or  7.4 million net.(ii) Help with other social costs9.      Under this scheme, the Exchequer reimburses two-&apos;thirds of theNCB*s expenditure on payments to their employees under the redundancy payments Act, for loss of superannuation and employment prospects, onpayments to encourage transferabilifry and other social payments.    Duringthe currency of the 1967 Act tho total Exchequer expenditure under this headis expected to be some  42 million.    K expenditure is continued on the3ame basis, then Exchequer expenditure in the three years after 1971 willbe of the order of  24 million.
(b) Increased Coal&quot;Bum and Deferment of Colliery Closures(i)  Increased Coal&quot;Burn10.       The 1967 Act provided for Exchequer expenditure of  45 million to compensate the electricity and gas supply Industries for burning more coalthan they would otherwise wish to do on economic grounds;,    We snould takecontingency powers to subsidise additional coal-burn In power stations fora further three years after Marchs 1971 to a maximum of  30 million In all.These powers would however be an insurance,, and the NCB would be told that they should maintain coal supply and demand in balance without extracoal-burnn    No commitment of public expenditure is entailed but therewould be of course a contingent call thereon.(ii) Deferment of Colliery Closure311.       The 1967 Act provides that the Minister may spend  5 million (whichmay be increased to  8 million by order) to reimburse the NCB forlosses arising from colliery closures deferred at the wish of the GovernmentThe cost to the Exchequer so far has been  2, 5 million^ of which by far the greater part is accounted for by the general programme of defermentsin the winter of 1967-68.    The cost of deferments under the present highlyselective policy Is small,, and we recommend that the present powers beextended until March, 1974 on a contingency basis,, so that between now and March, 1974 the maximum sum available wi31 be  5^ million includingthe  3 million which may be taken by order.(c) Coallmports and the Conversion of Power Stations12.      Coal supply and demand are now roughly In balance    The ministerial committee were however satisfied that we shall need to maintain theexisting bans on coal Imports and on the conversion of power stations.The ban on imports has stood since 1958.    The ban on conversions must continue for the time being in order to ease the contraction of the coalindustry,,    It is not$. however, easy to establish whether on balance theban does now or will in the future Impose net additional resource costson the nation as well as higher costs on the electricity industry? theposition will be kept under regular review.    These proposals do not,in general involve any cost to the Exchequer,
(d)  Cost13.       The additional cost of the proposed measures (for which no provision has been made in the Public Expenditure Survey Committee)will depend on whether benefits are tapered off on the lines indicated inparagraphs 4 and 6 of the Annextf and on whether the contingent powersto subsidise additional coal^burn and to pay compensation in respect ofdeferred pit closures were in fact used.    The order of the expenditure involved over the three years from 1971-72 is, however, as shown below:-Cost 1971-72 to 1973^74 in   million1971^-72    1972-73    19? 3-74Socia] Assistance(a)   Cost of a straight three-year extensionof existing provisions(i)   Redundancy scheme - gross(net)(ii)   Early pensions(iii)   Social costs (f rate)(b)   Possible savings*(?.)

140      In C(69) 132 the Lord President has already invited Cabinet torecognise that a Coal Bill, originally included in the list of ContingentBills, will be required.    A general reference to our intentions can thus be included in The Ckieen?s Speech.    Before any such announcement ismade, however, I will need to consult in confidence the Chairmen of the nationalised fuel industries, the National Union of Mineworkers and (iftime permits) the Energy Advisory Council.    Thereafter the necessaryBill might be introduced as soon as it can be prepared -* if possible aboutthe end of the year.    It might be accompanied by a short &quot;White Paper.Conclusions150      Accordingly, I invite my colleagues to agree that we should -(a) Take powers in the 1969-70 Session to enable us to continue afterMarch, 1971 -(i)       finance for a special scheme of compensation for redundantmineworkers (paragraph 8)?(ii)       a contribution to the social costs of the contraction of the coalindustry borne by the NCB (paragraph 9);(iii) on a contingency basis, subsidies for extra  oal-burn at power stations until 31st March8 1974 (paragraph 10)5(iv) on a contingency basis, subsidies to the NCB for keeping openat the Government1 s request pits which they would other wiseclose (paragraph II).(b) Maintain the ban on conversion of power stations from coal to oilor natural gas for the moment, but keep the position under regularreview (paragraph 12).(c) Despite the contingency powers under (a)(iii) above, set theNCB the clear objective of maintaining coal supply and demand in balance without extra coal-burn; refrain from endorsing as planningassumptions the NCB&apos;s objectives of sales of 135 million tons and productivity of 75 cwts0 per man shift in 1975; but encourage themto work for the highest practical productivity and tell them that, subjectto continuing review, a manpower rundown of 10 per cent a year seems-about right in present circumstances (paragraph 5).
16o      I also invite my colleagues -(a) To decide in respect of 15(a)(i.) and (ii) above Vvhether current rates should be continued for the three years after March, 1971, orwhether in either case mere should be.some tapering during this period(see Annex),(b) To agree that provision for the cost of the measures at 15(a)(i)and (ii) should be made in the current examination of public expenditure1971-72 to 1974-75.A.W.B.Ministry of Technology, S0W01014th October, 1969
This note describes possible ways of tapering off after March 1971the Government&apos;s contribution to the social costs of the coal industry&apos;scontraction and the compensation for redundant mineworkers, and summarisestheir effect on public expenditure.Redundancy Scheme^and premature pensions2.     This scheme, introduced in 19^7* applies to redundant miners overage 55, and would come to an end in March 1971 unless power were takento extend it.   The objectives of a tapering arrangement after March 1971would be to ensure that the period of commitment of further public expenditure on it is defined at the outset; and to prevent what was intended to be a generous but temporary method of dealing with a short-term problem becoming entrenched as permanent social service benefitspecial to the coal industry.3.     The range of alternative tapering arrangements which would theoreti-cally be possible is, of course, wide.   Officials suggest that from apractical point of view there are three possible ways of extending thescheme beyond 1971 which Ministers could consider:(a) An extension of the present scheme (unaltered) for throe years.The net*cost would bc:-197JZ72      1972/71      1,973/24 1.1m  2.0m  2.5m(b) A tapering period of entitlement, so that all payments end in1975.   Under this arrangement men redundant up to March 1972would receive payments for a maximum of three years as underthe existing scheme; men redundant up to March 1973 would receive payments for two to three years depending on the dateof redundancy and men redundant in the final year would receive benefits for one to two years again depending on theactual date of redundancy.   No individual miner would cease to receive benefits to which he is entitled under the existing scheme until after March 1975, but savings would start toaccrue after that date.   The net cost would be:-1973/Z2      1972/73      1973/74 1.1m  2.05m        2.55n*The not cost calculated after allowance for social security benefits for which they might otherwise be eligible.-1-  -ANNEXTAPERING- OP SOCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE COAL INDUSTRY AFTER 1$
CONFIDENTIAL

(c) Continuation of the present scheme for three years, but coupled with a firm statement that any continuation beyond 1974 would be on a tapering basis. The net cost up to 1974 would be the same as (a); the extra cost thereafter would depend on the arrangements made, but if the scheme were tapered over three years to 1977 it might total £13/4 million net.

Social Costs

4. Under the Coal Industry Act 1967 the Government contributes at a rate of two-thirds towards the costs incurred by the NCB on account of, inter alia, redundancies and transfers within the industry.

5. Officials consider that there are three possible ways of continuing to contribute to social costs after 1971, which deserve consideration:

(a) Maintenance of a 66.6 per cent contribution for each of the three years after 1971. This would cost £24 million over the three years.

(b) Payment of a 50 per cent contribution for each of the three years. This would save £6 million over the three years 1971/72 to 1973/74.

(c) Alternatively the reduction in the Government contribution from 66.6 per cent to 50 per cent could be phased over the three year period as follows: 66.6 per cent for 1971/72; 60 per cent for 1972/73 and 50 per cent for 1973/74. This would save £3 million compared with a straight continuation of present arrangements.

Costs

6. The annual effects on public expenditure are shown in Table I below. The savings possible by adopting tapering of the redundancy scheme and social costs subsidy are shown in Table II.
