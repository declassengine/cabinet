Cf 69)14315th October^ 1969CABINETTHE QUEEN&apos;S SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF parliament note by the Lord President of the council I have revised the draft of The Queen*s Speech on the Opening ofParliament to take account of the decisions made in Cabinet yesterday,I have adfied a provisional paragraph on the coa.1 industry (paragraph 24).Whether this and the paragraph on house rents (paragraph 31) remain in the speech will depend on the outcome of the deliberations tomorrow.2.      The Cabinet asked that the possibility be examined of including a reference in paragraph 5 to chemical warfare and I have added a possibleform of words to that paragraph in square brackets5 to my mind theaddition weakens the impact of the paragraph.3.      The other point outstanding is the form of the reference to theNorthern Ireland situation in paragraph 5g which it was decided should include a reference to the suggested legislation,,    A decision on this will need to be taken at the last possible moment,4.      Including the passages in square brackets the draft now runs to1P 007 words, compared with the usual 1, 000 words.    This is wiihout making any allowance for expanding the paragraph on Northern Ireland.COPY NO.    6 iT a F o PoPrivy Council Office^ S.
