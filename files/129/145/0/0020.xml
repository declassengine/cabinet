DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST VS GOVERNMENT)C(69)14521st: October. 1969CABINETREORGANISATION OF SECONDARY SCHOOLSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and ScienceAt a meeting on 12th May the Social Services Committee approvedmy proposal to introdtxce in the 1969&quot;70 legislative programme a Bill toprovide that, in fulfilling their duties under Section 8 of the Education Act,1944, every local education authority should have regard to the need forsecuring that education in schools maintained by them should be provided in non--selective schools, and that for that purpose it should be the duty of any authority, when required to do so, to submit to the Secretary of Stateproposals in a prescribed form and time, for the organisation of secondary school education in their area.    Cabinet decided on 14th October(CC(69) 48th Conclusions) that these proposals should be brought before itas soon as possible.2,      There is a place in the 1969-70 legislative programme for theBill (C(69) 35).    Authority for drafting was given by the Lord president on 19fch June, 1969.    Drafting has proceeded and the Bill is almost ready for introduction.    The reasons for the Bill were set out in my memorandum which was considered by the Social Services Committee and are.(i) In July, 1965 local education authorities in England and Wales were requested to submit plans by July, 1966 for reorganisingsecondary education on comprehensive lines.    The Education Actsgive the Secretary of State no power to compel Authorities or the governors of maintained voluntary schools to adopt the comprehensive system, and it was decided that we should rely on voluntary co-operation.(ii) Progress on this voluntary basis has been fairly satisfactory butbetween now and the next EJecfexon it will become increasinglyapparent that the process of planning has lost momentum and thata significant number of Authorities and voluntary school governorscan and will stand out against Government policy.    The facts areas fellowsr--1-4S ICOPY NO.
(iii)  There are 163 local education authorities.    107 of these have plansapproved covering the whole or greater part of their areas,although 60 of these plans do not include all the maintainedvoluntary schools in the Authorities1&apos; areas.    Very often the omission of voluntary schools is due to genuine difficulties facingsmall denominational schools but sometimes to the unwillingnessof voluntary schools, particularly aided grammar schools, to be absorbed into a comprehensive system,(iv) *Hrrerr Authorities have plans approved for a smaller part of their areas, and some of these have no intention of making further progress.    My Department at present has under considerationplans from ten further Authorities,    There are therefore25 Avithoriti.es from which we have no proposals.    Eight of these have formally declined to submit plans.    Another eight, withoutformally refusing to do so, have not yet submitted plans.    Ninehave had plans rejected as unsatisfactory and have not yetsubmitted revised proposals,(v)  Progress towards a fully comprehensive system is not just a matterof planning on paper.    The physical facSs of the nature anddistribution of the existing stock of school buildings mean that itwill be some years before all selective schools can be eliminated.Both pre-war and post-war buiidings are generally too small to be turned into comprehensive schools.    While it is possible for some small schools to form part of comprehensive schemes based on a two-tier organisation (an upper and a lower school)-, this solutioncan be adopted in only a limited number of cases; nor can Iimpose two-tier arrangements on Authorities which, though quitewilling to go comprehensive, are not prepared to introduce schemesof this kind which they believe would be educationally unsound,,(The Inner London Education Authority, when under Labour control,held this view).The draft Bill embodies my proposals which were before that committee,,    Colleagues may like to note that the intention to introduce the Bill has been made known in Parliament and outside.    In his May Dayspeech at the Festival Hall the Prime Minister saids&quot;We are planning the new legislation of the year that liesahead ,,...    The Education Bill crowning five years ofwork to provide equal educational opportunity and to endfor all time the tyranny of the 11-f selection in those ares which have lagged behind the rest of the nation .... r. &quot;In the Commons on 12th June, 1969 the Minister of State (Miss Bacon)said;?- 2-
&quot;But as my right honourable Friend has said, it is his intentionto introduce a Bill in the next Session of Parliament to ensurethat all local aufchoxdties submit schemes for secondaryreorganisation which will bring an end to selection at the age of11&quot;.Miss Bacon referred to the Bill in her speech to the Party Conference boththis year and last year.Provisions of the proposed bill .      The Bill as drafted provides that in fulfilling their duties underSection 8 of the Education Act, 1944 every local education authority shallhave regard to the need for securing that secondary education is provided in schools whose admission arrangements do not refer to ability oraptitude.    In some areas authorities rely on places in independent and directgrant schools to supplement maintained provision,.    The Bill would coverthese arrangements.    Colleagues may like to note that the Bill does notapply to:(i)  schools providing for handicapped children!(ii)  sixth form colleges for pupils above compulsory school age only,to which admission may properly be on an academic selectionbasis;(iii) the very exceptional school which may provide a specialisteducation in music or one of the other art3 (an idea I am stillconsidering),4.      The Bill would impose a duty on local education authorities tosubmit plans as and when they are required by the Secretary of State.The Bill would prescribe the manner in which such plans are to be formulated and specify the form of local consultation with managers andgovernors, teachers and parents likely to be affected by the proposals.It would empower the Secretary of State to approve a plan as submitted;to approve with modifications after consultation with the local educationauthority; or to reject a plan and direct the local education authority tosubmit proposals fulfilling such specific conditions as would, in theSecretary of state view, secure adequate measures for the reorganisation of secondary education in their area.5.      The Bill has no financial implications; it would deal with thepreparation and submission of plans for secondary reorganisation but would not contain any provision to secure their implementation either bylocal education authorities or by the governors of voluntary schools.
conclusion.      My proposal does not go so far as many of our supporters would wish.    But we have to accept that the framework set by the presentEducation Acts reflects a distribution of powers and duties between central and local government which cannot be upset except in the context of majorlegislation.    Even if this were not so it would be futile to take powers toimpose reorganisation when the school building programme cannot be large enough to allow for the early replacement of all school buildings which genuinely cannot be used as comprehensive schools.    nevertheless the proposed Billfi which goes as far as a short Bill can, would have realadvantages.    It would enable me to force those authorities who are standingout against our policy to produce plans for eliminating selection.    It wouldalso make it much easier for me to continue to insist that school building resources are deployed in a way consistent with an intention to xntx-oduce a comprehensive pattern.    The school building programme has been used asa lever to persuade authorities to plan for a comprehensive system since1966.    This policy has contributed useful results,,    But it is becomingsteadily more difficult to use it in the absence of any statutory basis forour policy.    The absence of statutory framework for our policy also makesme vulnerable to challenge when I exercise my statutory duties to approve the establishment and closure of schools and changes in their character by reference to Government policy which is nowhere embodied in the existingEducation Actsq7.      I invite my colleagues to approve these proposals and to agree thatthe Bill should be introduced next Session,E.W.S.Department of Education and Science, W,l8EOth October, 1969
