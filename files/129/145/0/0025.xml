The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee considered this issueat their meeting on 31st October and endorsed the proposals set out in my paper at Annex A, subject to some amendments to the draft explanatory&quot;White Paper which will accompany the BilL    These amendments havebeen incorporated into the draft at Annex B,3a      In accordance with the wishes of the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee, I have sent the draft &quot;White Paper to the Northern ireland government for their comments.    The draft at Annex B includes thoseamendments suggested by the Northern Ireland Government which we can accept without difficulty.    These are set out for ease of reference in annex C $ 6 follow).4.       Two other amendments suggested by the Northern ireland government are in my view unacceptableV(a) Paragraph 5, line 3^    Delete the word &quot;armed&quot;.The point o  keeping this word is that it distinguishes betweendefence against armed attack which will be the job of the Army and thenew force, and defence against unarmed attack which will be the job ofthe Royal Ulster Constabulary.(b) Paragraph 10? lines 3 and 40    Delete &quot;without discrimination&quot;.We need to emphasise that recruitment will be without discrimination if any Roman Catholics are to present themselves for recruitment to the new force.
5,      Finally there are some suggestions by the Northern ireland government on which my colleagues will wish to reach a decision afterdiscussions-(a) Title.The Northern Ireland Government would prefer &quot;Ulster defence force&quot;,    I would prefer on balance to stick to &quot;Northern Ireland defence force&quot;,(b) Employment of on crowd control or riot duties in cities(paragraph 5, last sentence).The Northern Ireland Government do not wish to mention, and certainly emphasise, this point,    I think we can go some way to meetingthem presentationally, while preserving the important issue of substance,by substituting the following for the last two sentences2-&quot;It is not the intention to employ it on crowd control or riot duties in cities, and in practice its tasks are most likely to bo in rural areas&quot;.(c) size of the force (paragraph 6, last sentence).The Northern Ireland Government v/ould like this sentence to reads-&quot;The actual size of the force will be determined in the light of experience, and will be in the region of 6,000 officers andmen&quot;.I think that we must establish a ceiling figure, and that we should leaveourselves the option of recruiting less than this figure.(d) Liability for callout (paragraph 8).We have agreed an extensive redraft of this paragraph on lines proposed by the Northern Ireland Government in order to make it morecomprehensible to the ordinary man in the street:-&quot;Members of the force will be liable to be called out for serviceonly in Northern Ireland &apos;m any of the following circumstances:(i)      For the defence of life or property in Northern Irelandagainst armed attack or sabotaget whether actual orapprehended.    This liability relates to v/hat Lord FIunt!scommittee called *fche threat of armed guerilla-typeattack&apos; and will permit rapid reaction to meet any localemergency.    For the purpose of this liability for service,the Secretary of State for Defence may authorise an officerof the regular forces not below the rank of Major to call out
the force or any part of its  and may empower such anofficer in turn to authorise another officer of the regular forces to the same end0    The Secretary of State may attachsuch conditions to the exercise of the power to call out asmay seem expedient to him    As stated above inparagraph 7, the General Officer Commanding wouldin practice act in consultation with the Security committee presided over by the Minister ox Home Affairs.(ii)      In deience of the United Kingdom against actual orapprehended attack.(iii)      In circumstances of imminent national danger or greatemergency&quot;.I have not felt able to accept two further amendments to this paragraphsuggested by the Northern Ireland Government s-(l)     To circumscribe my power of callout by stating that it would inpractice be exercised in consultation with the Security Committee,(2)    The insertion of &quot;or sabotage&quot; after &quot;apprehended attack&quot; in (ii)of the redrafted paragraph 8 above.(e)    Training (paragraph 3.5).The Northern Ireland Government have suggested a redraft whose main objective was to delete the obligation upon members of the new force to undertake an annual training period in camp.    If the new force is to be efficient, this period of consecutive training is vital and I do not think wecan meet the Northern Ireland Government&apos;3 wish.

secret ANNEX ATHE NEW DEFENCE FORCE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDThe Cabinet decided on 7th October to set up in NorthernIreland a locally-recruited part-time military defence force underthe control of the General Officer Commanding (GOC), NorthernIreland,  to undertake the military tasks now performed by the ulster Special Constabulary (USC).     The Government of NorthernIreland agreed to the creation of this new force at a series of meetings with the Home Secretary on 9th and 10th October.      I was invited,  in consultation with the Home Secretary, to consider urgently what legislation would be necessary to bring the force into being.      (CC(69)h6th Meeting),     This paper sets out my proposals.legislation2,    I informed my colleagues that the new force would not be partof the existing Army Reserve and that it would not therefore be setup by amendments to existing Army Reserves legislation but wouldrequire the introduction of a separate comprehensive Bill.     Thisjill enable the legislation to fit the special characteristics ofthe new force, in particular the requirement for a call-outliability which meets the individual needs of Northern Ireland.3,    I envisage a short Bill (say, ten Clauses) which providesauthority to establish the force, prescribes the framework of itsconditions of service and of its discipline, and specifies thecircumstances in which it may be called out for service.     Detailsof the conditions of service will be set out in Regulations madeunder the Act.k,    This accords with the normal pattern of Reserve legislation andmakes it possible to deal with a number of important matters such asthe command, organisation and equipment of the force outside theBill Itself.     But I propose, that in order to give a completepicture of the force and to avoid misunderstanding, the Bill shouldbe supplemented by a short White Paper giving a factual account ofthe Government&apos; s proposals for the new force.     A draft of thisfhite Paper is at Annex B.5.    The Home Secretary and I feel that the new force should beestablished at the earliest possible moment.     I therefore intend to open recruiting for the force on 1st January,  1970.     This means that all stages of the legislation must be passed by the timeParliament rises for Christmas.      I have consulted the lord president;   work on drafting the Bill is under way;    and I hope topresent the Bill to the Legislation Committee on 11th November.Proposals for new Force&amp;i    My proposals for the main features of the new force are set outin the draft White Paper.     They are intended, as far as is possible,to reconcile two conflicting aims.      The first is to create a force&apos;hich will include a substantial number of Northern Irish roman catholics and members of other minority groups who were reluctant tojoin the USC.     The second is to ensure that enough people join theforce to enable it to begin a viable existence early next year.      in practical terms this means that we must in the early months attractJ sufficient number of present USC personnel and members of the protestant community in general.     Failure to create a sufficiently/large
large force might make it more difficult to disband the USC at anearly date and could require us to maintain a larger permanentgarrison than we can afford.I, The force will be entirely military and therefore under thecontrol of the GOC, Northern Ireland, who is responsible to me.The Northern Ireland Government have no constitutional relationship with the GOC in regard to the regular forces under his command, andthere will b e nothing in the Bill to establish any formal relation-ship between them over the new force.     They will be able toexercise influence only through consultative processes.8,      The Commander of the force will be a Regular Army Brigadierand there will be a Regular Army Major and a small regular staff at each battalion headquarters (paragraph 7 of the White Paper).     Thepresence of this regular element will be a stabilising influence onthe locally recruited members, and will, through the militarytraining described in paragraph 15, help in shaping a disciplinedand efficient force.9,      Decisions to call out the force in whole or in part (or toBtand it down) will be under the control of the GOC acting on mybehalf.     The Bill will specifically provide me with authority to designate officers empowered to call out the force, (who will beofficers of the regular forces not below the rank of major)(paragraph 8) and to prescribe conditions for the exercise of this power.     The concurrent authority of the civil power will not berequired.     Call-out orders by the proper military authority will &quot;beenforceable under the provisions of the Bill.10.     To ensure that manbership of the new force will be, and willhe seen to be, open to all sections of the community, and to eliminate local and sectarian bias, all applications to enlist willbe considered and decided centrally at Headquarters, NorthernIreland.     The central board will naturally give due weight to therecommendation of the local force commander but will not regard itas conclusive for either acceptance or rejection (paragraph 10).II. The proposals in paragraphs 7 to 10 of the White Paper taken together constitute a radical change from the present arrangements and should ensure that the new force will not simply be the USC undera different guise.12.     In exceptional circumstances it may be necessary to authorisesome members of the force to keep arms and ammunition in their homes.     On these occasions they will be subject to military law atall times, a measure unprecedented for a part-time force in peace(paragraph 1k).13.    The actual  size of the force will be determined in the lightof experience but will not exceed 6,000 officers and men.     this number is derived from calculations of the numbers of guards andpatrols required for specific key points,  installations and routes,the wide area requiring protection, and the need for relief for members of the force when on operational duty.     It represents themaximum requirement which might arise during the next few years.    Inpractice the force will be substantially smaller in the immediatefuture.     The Home Secretary has reservations about a ceilingestablishment higher than U,0O0./1k.
It is essential quickly to achieve a satisfactory strength ifit&apos;is to be politically possible for the Northern Ireland Governmentto disband the USC.     This can only be achieved by transfers fromthe USC.     The appointment of influential County Commandants of the[ISC as battalion commanders of the new force (paragraph 7) will encourage such transfers.     To the same end, the proposed emoluments(paragraph 16) are as generous as   possible consistent with those ofthe nearest comparable reserve force, the T &amp; have.15,    I envisage that recruitment to the new force will begin on1st January,  1970 and that by 1st April,  1970 it should be possibleIfor it to take over the present operational tasks of the USC(paragraph 18).     During this overlap period operational tasks willcontinue to be the responsibility of the USC.     Successful recruit-lent in part depends on the certainty that the USC will be disbanded.The Northern Ireland Government should be encouraged to co-operate with the GOC in working out transitional arrangements as a matter of urgency and to agree to a firm disbandment date for the USC.     Ibelieve that this date should be about the 1st June,  1970.Cost of the new Force.16,    On the basis of a strength of 6,000 the cost of the new forcein a normal year with no periods of callout is estimated at aboutp1 a year.     Initial capital expenditure will be about  m0.3 on[iniforms and equipment.      I would expect that no capital costs wouldk incurred in respect of any existing accommodation taken over fromthe USC or otherwise owned by the Government of Northern Ireland^rat there would be some initial capital expenditure in the likelypent of a requirement for new building.7,    If the costs are to lie against Defence votes, this will be alew commitment and I will be bound to seek an equivalent increase in the Defence Budget.I hope that the draft Bill will go to the Legislation Committee5n 11th November and be published on the 12th, so that the secondleading in the Commons can take place in the week beginningpth November.     It will be convenient if the White Paper is publishedjj&amp; 12th November to accompany the Bill.onclu3 IonsI?&apos;    I seek the Committee&apos;s agreement to my proposals:a. for the policy for the new force as set out in the draft white Paper at Annex B;b. for annual reimbursement of the cost to the defence budget as set out in paragraph 17;c. for legislation as indicated in paragraphs 2-5;d. for the draft White Paper at Annex B.INISTRY OF DEFENCE, S.W.1.P November, 1969.
SECitETANNEX draft WHITE PAPERFORMATION OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND DEFENCE FORCEintroductionOn the 13th October the Government announced in Parliament its intention to introduce a Bill which would create in Northern ireland a locally recruited, part-time, military defence force.     The creationof such a force was recommended &quot;by Lord Hunt&apos;s Advisory Committee on police in Northern Ireland.     The Government of Northern Ireland hadalready announced its agreement with Lord Hunfs proposal.2,    Lord Hunfs Committee based its main recommendation on theprinciple that police and military roles should be separate inNorthern Ireland, as they are in the rest of the United Kingdom.Military tasks, the report recommended,  should exclusively be under-taken by military forces.     In consequence, the Committee proposedthat the Royal Ulster Constabulary should be withdrawn from all mili-tary duties and that the Ulster Special Constabulary should be replaced by two separate forces.     One would be a volunteer police reserve tosupport the RUC, in the performance of normal police duties.     Theother would be a locally recruited part-time force, under the controlof the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland, to support theregular military forces on purely military duties.3.    This White Paper sets out the Government&apos;s proposals for this newpart-time military force.     The Government of Northern Ireland havebeen fully consulted.Titleh.    The title of the new force will be The Northern Ireland defence force.Task5&apos;    The task of the new force will be to support the regular forces to Northern Ireland should circumstances so require in protecting the border and the State against armed attack and sabotage.      It will ful-f*l its role by undertaking guard duties at key points andT //installations,
installations, by carrying out patrols and by establishing checkpoints and road blocks when required to do so.     In practice, suchtasks are most likely to prove necessary in rural areas.     It is notthe intention to employ the new force upon crowd control or riot duties in cities,firiganisatlon6,    The new force will be part of Her Majesty&apos;s military forces.     Itnil consist of lightly armed companies.     These will be groupedaccording to local operational requirements into units of differentsizes to be known as battalions.      Battalion areas will approximate to county boundaries.     The actual size of the force will be determined inthe light of experience as the build-up proceeds, but in any case willnot ultimately exceed 6,000 officers and men.7,    The new force will be under command of the General OfficerCommanding, Northern Ireland.     While remaining responsible to her majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, the General OfficerCommanding will work in the closest consultation with the Governmentof Northern Ireland through a Security Committee presided over by theMinister of Home Affairs.     Its immediate commander will be a RegularUrny Brigadier.     The battalion commanders will be local members of theIforce;   during its early life these appointments may be filled byjpresent County Commandants of the Ulster Special Constabulary, all of&quot;horn   are ex-officers of the regular forces and who have had muchexperience in dealing with the tasks for which the new force is^signed.     Each battalion commander will be assisted by a RegularArmy Major responsible for training and administration.     A smallfegular staff will support the training major, and administrativepersonnel will be recruited locally.f&apos; The Bill will provide for members of the new force to have the[following liabilities for service:-
a. The Secretary of State for Defence may designate an officerof the Regular Forces to call out the force or any part of it;and may authorise such an officer in turn to designate anotherofficer of the Regular Forces to the same end.     An officer sodesignated shall not be below the rank of major;    and theSecretary of State,  or other officer making the designation, mayattach such conditions to the exercise of the power to call out,as may seem expedient to him.Any Officer so designated may call out the force, or such part of it as may be specified in the terms of his designation,whenever it appears to him necessary or expedient to do so forthe defence of life or property in Northern Ireland against armed attack or sabotage, whether actual or apprehended.This liability relates to what Lord Hunfs Committee called&quot;the threat of armed guerilla-type attack&quot; and will permit rapidreaction to meet any local emergency.b. Members of the force will be liable to be called out for service,  only in Northern Ireland:-(i) in circumstances of imminent national danger orgreat emergency;(ii) in defence of the UK against actual or apprehendedattack.Members of the force who are called out will be given the sameIjotection - including protection against loss of employment - as$embers of the reserve forces,fe^ofseryiceI Lord Hunfs Committee recommended that this new force shouldlovide full opportunity for all citizens of Northern Ireland to servele community as a whole.
