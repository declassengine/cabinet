W. 1.6th October, 1969COPY NO.
ANNEXPrime Minister&apos;s Statement to the Lobby on 5th October, 1969Before I give the details of the changes in the organisation ofGovernment, and of the personalities involved, I should like to explain the principles and strategy underlying what I am trying to achieve.Some of the things I am doing have been in contemplation for aconsiderable period of time, and it was early in July that I gaveinstructions for work to begin on the main changes which I had decided on by that time and which are being announced tonight.One aim is to concentrate the process of decision-making increasinglyon senior Ministers, with wider responsibilities, who will take thedecisions on a chain of command basis, rather than by inter-departamental committees.   This was the principle that underlay the reorganisation overthe years of Defence.   There is no doubt at all who takes the decisionsthere.   Before that time there was a great deal of co-ordination but thedecision-making now is clear and direct.   The same principle underlay the integration of the Health and Social Security Departments where again oneMinister takes the decisions rather than doing it through committeescovering more than one Department.   Again in what were formerly three departments, Foreign Office, Commonwealth Office and Colonial Office, thepolicy decisions now are taken on a chain of command basis by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.I have now decided to extend this principle in two additionalfields.   The first is in industrial policy.   The Chancellor of theExchequer will of course continue as supreme in financial and economic policy.The main changes will be to concentrate responsibility and decision-making in the field of national and regional industrial policy.Anthony Wedgwood Benn will remain the head of the Ministry of technology which will be unchanged in name, but greatly extended incoverage.-0)-
His present powers cover the aerospace industries, until 1967 ina separate Department, the nuclear industries, a great part of the technological and research effort, Including research development, NRDCetc., together with sponsorship of all the engineering industries,including electrical engineering as well as shipbuilding and electronics.The industries for which he will be directly responsible will from now on include most of the Board of Trade industries the major onceaffected being the chemical industries, new finding their natural homewith chemical engineering, and textiles which are increasingly linked with chemicals, through man-made fibres but which will also now be in thesame Department as textile machinery.He will also take over the responsibilities of Minister of Power, by far the biggest ministerial industrial!, complex at present outside theTechnology Ministry,   This brings into a single Department electricitygeneration, and nuclear power; electricity generation and the electricityplant industries; gas and oil with chemicals; steel with the industriesusing steel.It also means that Ministers who are sponsoring the coal mining industry will have more authority in that they mil have a voice in the developmentof other areas of decision-making where coal can be affected.   I am thinkingnot only of the linking of coal with raining machinery, but the linking ofcolliery closures with the industrial and regional responsibilities for providing alternative work.   At the sane time general responsibility formineral development, which I had already decided to centre in the Ministryof Power, will come under the Minister of Technology.   This will mean that non-ferrous metal extraction and development will be with the main non-ferrous metal using industries.I referred ju3t now to regional responsibilities.   All the presentduties of the Board of Trade in connection with the distribution of industry,IDCSj advance factories, responsibility for industrial estates in development areas, building grants and loans, will be transferred to Technology.   Ihave felt for some time that over as wide an area as possible responsibilityfor these aspects of policy should be in the sajae Department which carriesthe responsibilities for sponsoring and dealing with the problems of mostof the industries concerned.   The Department responsible for dealing withthe general problems of an industry or perhaps a major firm, will thus beresponsible for the location of its expansion programme instead of this being handled by two separate Departments.(2)SECRET
SECRETResponsibility for investment grants will also be transferred fromthe Board of Trade to the Ministry of Technology.The responsibility for the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation willalso pass to the Ministry of Technology.The responsibility for industrial policy, outside of course the very wide functions carried out by the Department of Employment and Productivity,will be concentrated in a single Department.   The Ministry of Technologywill become one of the biggest Government Departments and will be carryingout the functions of two existing Departments,   itself and Power, and   asubstantial volume of work transferred from the Board of Trade and theDepartment of Economic Affairs.Tony Benn will also have working to him two Senior Ministers.Reg Prentice will move from the Ministry of Overseas Development at hi3present level and status.   Harold Lever rail join the Department asPaymaster General and will be in the Cabinet.   It will be for Tony Benn towork out and report to me his proposals for the division of duties betweenthe three senior Ministers as well as the more junior Ministers who willbo there.With the transfer of many industrial functions from the Board of Tradeto the Ministry of Technology, the Board will concentrate tho greater partof its energies on overseas trade and export promotion including aconsiderable proportion of the sectors responsible for invisible earnings.In addition to its responsibilities for external commercial policy (includingtariff policy) and export policy and services, the Board of Trade will retain responsibility for civil aviation, shipping, tourism, hotelo and insurance.   On the home side, its work will be primarily related to commerceincluding the administration of the Insurance and Companies Acts, patentsand copyright.   It will continue to be responsible for consumer protection,for tho distributive and service trades, including retail distribution, fornewspapers, printing, publishing and films, these being more in the field of communications than industries as normally conceived.The President of the Board of Trade will be Roy Masonf and he and theMinister of State will spend a great deal of their time in direct contact on exports with industry throughout tho regions, in addition to promotingsales of British exports overseas.   The regional export organisation will be strengthened.   It will be remembered that Roy Mason started his ministerialcareer in the Board of Trade when he was in charge of the section of theBoard&apos;3 work dealing with shipping,     civil   aviation and tourism.
These changes give us the opportunity to rationalise the work of thevarious Government Departments in the field of productivity - where thereare a large number of advisory and other bodies.     I have askedBarbara Castle, who has, of course, been developing the productivityservices in her own Department, to take this up urgently and produce a plan for rationalising and. streamlining.     To enable her to do this effectivelyshe will take on immediately the responsibility for the Government relationswith the British Productivity Council, the British Institute of Management,and the Centre for Inter-firm Comparisons.As has been announced, the Government is urgently reviewing the questionof the public accountability of firms in industry, including the rolos ofthe Monopolies Commission and of the National Board for Prices and Incomes.The future departmental responsibility for monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices will be decided in the light of the Government^ decision whichis to be announced shortly.with the transfer, I have mentioned of the industrial functions of theDepartment of Economic Affairs to the Ministry of Technology - I shall havea word to say about their regional work in a moment - Department of economic affairs as a Department will disappear, but its functions, intensified and strengthened, will be carried out elsewhere.I shall continue to be Chairman of NEDC.     Contact with NEDO on theagenda and priorities of the Counoil&apos;s business, and of co-ordinatingbriefs thereon, will pass to the Cabinet Office, who will also beresponsible for supervising the Vote and for NED0&apos;s staffing.The work hitherto done by the Department of Economic Affairs on medium and long-term economic assessment will pass to the Treasury, the industrialaspects of planning passing to the Ministry of Technology.The Treasury will assume co-ordinating responsibility for those aspectsof the work of the NEDC whioh relate to the continuing process of preparing,producing and following up planning documents, and for co-ordinating thework of the individual Departments who have the responsibility for consultations with industry on them.     Consultation with EDCs, the littleNEDDYs, will pass in each case to the Department responsible for the industrywhose work   is covered by the little-NEDDY, e.g. Technology for mochanioalengineering or machine tools, Agriculture for the farming NEDDY, the Boardof Trade for retail distribution etc.(4)
The other major development lies in the field of housing and localgovernment, regional planning, including land use and transport polioy,and responsibility for the environment.As I indioated in my speech to the Association of Municipal Corporationsat Scarborough, I am particularly anxious to put more power into the workwhich will he urgently prooeeding following the consultations on the redcliffe-Maud Report.I am therefore putting the existing Departments of Housing and LocalGovernment, and Transport, under tho direction of a new Secretary of Statefor Local Government and Regional Planning.     The Secretary of State willbe Tony Crosland who will take personal charge of the post-Maud negotiations.Ho will have helping him Tony G-reenwood as Minister of Housing and LooalGovernment and Ered Mulley as Minister of Transport, Mr. Marsh retiringfrom the Government.     The existing regional work of the Department ofEconomio Affairs, in particular responsibility for the Regional economic planning Councils and Regional Econoniio Planning Boards, will also pass tothe now set-up.     The Seoretory of State will thus be responsible for allregional planning questions except, of course, for the location of industrywork transferred to Technology.As you know, I have spent a good deal of time meeting RegionalEoonomio Planning Councils and Regional Economio Planning Boards in different parts of the country.     It is becoming increasingly a misnomer to refer tothem as primarily economio in their functions.     If you read the variousregional plans which they have produced, the emphasis has been more and more on a broad plan of the region as a whole, with a more marked concentration on transport planning, but also on social development, urban renewal, andother amenity questions covering a wide range of environmental problems.I have asked the new Secretary of State to go urgently into tho questionof environmental pollution in all its forms and to make proposals to me on how this should be dealt with, including any changes he may feel it rightto reoommend in the machinery of government or tho law.    His responsibilities of course extend only to England, but in this matter of pollution he will ofcourse make his recommendations in consultation \7ith the Secretaries ofState for Scotland and for Wales whoso responsibilities and statutoryfunotions remain unohongod in this and in all othor matters.(5)SECRET
The Secretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planningwillj of course, be a member of the Cabinet but not his two colleagues the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Housing and Local Government.He will speak for the whole set-up in Cabinet^   The statutory functions ofthe Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Minister of transport will continue a3 at present but I shall ask the Secretary of State toreport to me on what changes ahould be made at a later date with a viewof creating a more integrated Department.   I would not expect this remitto have top priority since I want him and the Ministers under him to concentrate their activities on housing, on Maud, on regional planning andthe problems of environment.Now I turn to the other changes at Cabinet level.   George Thomson,at present Minister without Portfolio, will go to the Foreign and commonwealth office as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in plaoe of Fred Lee, whois retiring.   George Thomson will remain  in the Cabinet and, in additionto being overall deputy to Michael Stewart on the whole range of theoffice, he will take personal oharge under Michael Stewart on all questions affecting relations with Europe, including the conduct of negotiationswith e.c..Although objections have sometimes been made against &quot;double banking&quot;inlho Cabinet, the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is now so great that, as in 1961-1963*      i-3 necessary to have two Foreign OfficeMinisters in the Cabinet.This will help to lighten the load on the Foreign and CommonwealthSeoretary in that High Commissioners, Ambassadors and visiting ministers and others will be able to go to one or other of the two Foreign and commonwealth Offloe Ministers in the Cabinet.I have found that my decision to put the Chief Secretary in theCabinet has worked very well.   In addition to giving the Chief Secretarypersonal responsibility under the Chanoellor for matters affecting national expenditure, he has had more authority in dealing with Ministerial head3of spending Departments.(6)
George Thomson will &quot;bo suooeedod as Minister without Portfolioby Peter Shore.   For tho reasons I have stated fewer interdepartmentalcommittees will he needed, and it is intended therefore that tho minister without Portfolio will also take over the duties hithorto carried outby Judith Hart, until today the Paymaster General.Judith Hart herself will sucoeed Rag Prentice at Ministry of overseas development.The creation of the new post of Secretary of State for LocalGovernment and Regional Planning and the redistribution of the funotionsof the Department of Economic Affairs toko effect at onoe; andTony Yfodgwood Benn will for the time being became Minister of Power.   Butthe aotual merger of the Ministries of Technology and Power, and thetransfer to the former Department of functions from the Board of Trade(and of responsibility for tho Industrial Reorganisation Corportionfrom the Department of Economic Affairs), have to be effected by on order-in-Council which rep^air es Parliamentary approval.   Por this purpose it is intended to. lay a draft Transfer of Functions Order as soon aspossible after the two Houses resume, and I shall also make a statement to the House.In about a \7oek,s time I hope to have a further list of changes atMinister of State and Parliamentary Under-Secretory level.   Theadministrative changes I have announced will permit some reduction inthe number of Junior Ministers, and a resultant reduction in the size ofthe administration as a vihole.To sum up.   First the number of Departments.   In the economic fieldwe have at present six departments.   The Treasury, the Department ofEmployment and Productivity, Board of Trade, Department of Economic Affairs,Technology and Power - leaving Transport for tho moment out of thoequation.   Two of these disappear as separate entitities, and tho Boardof Trade will be concerned as to the greater proportion of its time,energies and staffing with exports and overseas trade, inoludinginvisibles.   In place of six there are, therefore, four.   In additionTransport and the Ministry of Housing oome under a single Secretary ofState, while still retaining thoir statutory identities.(7)
The size of the Cabinet ia reduced from 23 to 21, though owing to double banking in the Treasury, Foreign and Commonwealth Offioe and technology the members who are there representing particular functions,i.e. as Head of a Department or with specific non-departmental duties, arereduced from 22 to 18.Second, these changes, as I have said above, are designed to makeit possible for far more decisions to be taken within Departments, withintho area controlled by single Ministers, rather than between Departments.They should, therefore, considerably reduce the number of and time spent on interdepartmental committees, both ministerial and official.Finally, in addition to the changes in the Foreign and commonwealth office, they are designed to put more drive and power in the two ares which are priority thenes for the year3 immediately ahead, namelyindustrial modernisation and efficiency, and the modernisation of localgovernment, with the development of and greator participation by the regions, and tho attack on the problems of the environment.jrjjh.
