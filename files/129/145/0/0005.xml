DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)C(69)1303rd October, 1969COPY NO,CABINET671969 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEYCOMMITTEEMemorandum by the Minister of Overseas development in the discussion in Cabinet on 16th September about public expenditure in 1971-72. it was agreed (GC(69)44th Conclusions, Minute 3)that the difference of view between the Treasury and the Ministry of overseas Development about the cost of continuing existing policy inthe aid field would need to be considered as part of the detailed proposalsfor economies in 1971-72.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer will no doubt be bringing proposals by officials to the Cabinet shortly.    3h the meantimeI should like my colleagues to be aware of the position as I see it,2.       The Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PFSC) figuresindicate two different interpretations of aid policy for C&amp;e early 1970s,,3,       The Chancellor&apos;s version assumes that we should continue withour basic  205 million programme, in cash terms, plus one or two extraitems that will decline during the period under review.    This figure wouldmean an aid programme declining even in cash termsj declining evenmore in real terms; and getting further away from our pledge to reachaid totals of 1 per cent of Gross National Product (GNP)04. My figures represent a gradual rise in aid as a percentage of GNP,consistent with reaching the I per cent target in the late 1970s,5.       The question at issue is whether we take our 1 per cent pledgeseriously enough to make some modest progress towards it in the early1970s or whether we are to slip further away from it.Our pledges as a Party6.      Successive annual conferences over several years have identifiedthe fight against world poverty as one of the major concerns of our Partyin world affairs.    There have been many references in policy statements to spending 1 per cent of our national wealth on aid to developing countries,and this was specifically pledged in our 1964 Manifesto.
7.      In 1963 the Conference adopted the statement; &quot;Britain: progress and Change&quot;, in which world poverty was identified as one of the sevenmajor issues in the 1970s,,    The recent Party Conference supported theNational Executive Committee statement which called for an aidperformance of 1 per cent of GNP by a date somewhere between1972 and 1975.Our pledges as a government.      We voted for the resolution at the Second United Nations Conferenceon Trade and Development in New Delhi last year which accepted a target for net financial flows to developing countries of 1 per cent of GNP (this includes private investment as well as official aid).    We are committed by the resolution to use our best endeavours to this end.9.      I have of course had to speak on this subject several times atinternational conferences since the New Delhi Conference.    I have alwaysmade it clear that Britain stands by the 1 per cent target but that the rateof our progress towards it must depend on our success in overcoming our balance of payments difficulties.International pressure this year10.      For a number of reasons there will be increasing pressure during1969 upon us and upon other donors to be more specific about reaching the1 per cent target.    For examples-fa)    The 1970s have been designated by the United Nations as theSecond Development Decade and in the preliminary discussions the developing countries are pressing for 1972 as the target date for reaching1 per cent.    Our Ambassador in Geneva has warned us of the &quot;high riskof building up a serious measure of resentment&quot; among developing countries if we cannot be more positive in our attitude.(b)    The international commission appointed by the President ofthe World Bank has just reported on the world development situation.It had a very high-level membership with Mr. Lester Pearson as theChairman.    Sir Edward Boyle was a member.    The report identifiesBritain as one of the countries who &quot;have allowed their official aid to decline as a proportion of GNP in the 1960s and are far removed fromthe target&quot;.    It recommends that all industrialised countries should provide resource transfers of at least 1 per cent of GNP as rapidly aspossible and in no case later than 1975 and that official aid (excludingprivate investment) should reach 0.7 per cent by 1975 or shortlythereafter, but in no case later than 1980.    This report has receivedvery wide attention in the world Press and was welcomed by the PrimeMinister in a statement on behalf of Her Majesty!s Government.
(c) The Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee of theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, reviewing the United Kingdom^ performance in 1968, has said that the need forrestrictive measures on public expenditure cannot any longer h% accepted as a justification for limiting aid funds to a constant cash level, v/hosevalue is declining in real terms,,    (See extract attached/.    In May he called on all donors to reach 1 per cent &quot;at least by 1975&quot;.(d) There will also be pressure from developed countries who havereached the target cr who plan to do so shortly.    France already exceeds1 per cent; the Germans are on the point of doing so  Sweden and theNetherlands have said they are prepared to do so by 1972,    In view ofthe mounting pressure this year, I would expect a number of othercountries to follow suite11.       The Chancellor*s proposals for gross official aid flows whichwould count towards the target are as follows (All figures in thisparagraph are in cash terms.    Overseas aid is the only programme which is not adjusted annually for price increases.    In real terms thismeans a reduction of  5** 6 million each year )s-1969-70 r?7Q-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74222 230 227 224 219As net figures (after deducting capital repayments of aid loans) thesebecome189 200 193 188 181Taking the assumptions of Medium-Term Assessment Committee 1969Basic Case I about the rate of growth of GNP and an optimistic view ofprivate flows, the total flow as a percentage of GNP would bes-0.77 0.77 0.73 0.71 0,68We should be getting further from our pledge each year.12.      In the PESC Report, I set out proposals as follows  million1969-70       1970-71       1971-72       1972-73       1973-74Gross 222 23C 260 289 310Net 136 200 226 253 280On the best figures then available these proposals would have broughtus in 1974-75 to 0. 95 per cent of GNP.    Since the PESC Report was prepared various figures have changed.    Our total performance in-3-
1968-69 was only 0-81 per cent lower than I had hoped0    Furthermore,estimates of GNP in the years ahead have risenD    These variations wouldrequire official flows larger than my proposals to reach 0-95 per cent in1974-7 5013.       This modest objective would itself be lower than the performanceexpected of us by world opinion, recipients and donors alike, but in thelight of our general economic situation I have not increased my proposals.These would involve devoting to additional aid only a tiny fraction(0o7 per cent) of the expected increase in our GNP.14.      If our financial position improves rapidly we should makefaster progress and aim at 1 per cent by 1975,    But in any event we should make some progress, and not slip further behind as theTreasury propose.Aid and the balanqe of payments15.      I accept that the balance of payments situation puts severerestraints on all public expenditure including overseas aid.    Buttaking a long view I am convinced that aid benefits our balance ofpayments.    I am sure that our balance of payments position wouldbe worse today if we had had no aid programme in the last ten years,and that a rising programme in the next few years will lead toimprovements in our balance of payments in due course.    Thefollowing points are relevant:(a) About two-thirds of our aid is spent on goods and services from Britain, i. e. only about  70 million a year goes across theexchanges.(b) &quot;We get back about  60 million a year in repayment of capital and interest on old loans under the aid programme.    Thus the netcurrent cost across the exchanges is very small indeed.(c) Trade follows aid, e. g. if we provide a factory, a harbouror a technical college overseas, we get future orders for spares andreplacementsj if we bring students and trainees to Britain they arelikely to &quot;buy British&quot; when they become managers? if we providetractors under an aid programme the recipient country may buy someof the same tractors with its own resources later on.(d) We get export orders from the untied portions of other countries1aid.    At present we provide about l\ per cent of the global flow of aid,but we get nearly 12 per cent of the orders for goods imported by developing countries from developed countries.(e) We shall particularly benefit from the point mentioned in(d) if there is an all-round increase in aid in the years ahead, i. e.if all major donors respond to the call to reach the 1 per cent target.We ought to join in the pressure on other donors to do this but our influence of course is bound to depend upon our own performance,
16D       Public expenditure has increased since 1964 by 52 per cent, butthe gross official aid programme has only increased by 8 per cent.    Thisis the smallest increase of any department except defence.    As a percentage of GNP our official aid performance has gone down from. 53 per cent in 1964 to 0. 42 per cent in 1968,Is this the time?17,      I accept that this is not the time for a public commitment thatwe will reach 1 per cent by any particular year,18,       But we are committed to publishing our fi^e-year expenditureforecast and something must be written in for the overseas aid totals.We cannot avoid making a decision about 1971-72 and giving some indication of what we propose for 1972-73 and 1973-74.    It is thepurpose of the Public Expenditure Survey to do so,19.      Once the Survey figures are agreed it will be very difficult for me or for any future Minister to get them increased,.    The pressureis usually in the other direction!Political effects20.      There is an &quot;aid lobby&quot; in this country of people influenced by OXFAM, War on Want, Christian Aid, etc.    Their numbers aregrowing especially among young people.    Most of them still believe in the basic sincerity of our intentions in this field and will accept our balance of payments situation as an excuse for slow progress.    Theywill not accept it as an excuse for making no progress,,21D       In particular the churches are now becoming much more involved.Christian Aid Week makes a bigger impact each year0    An EpiscopalCommission of the Catholic Church has issued a manifesto calling for1 per cent of the  GNP for the paying of Government aid, 1 per cent ofthe Church1 s income to be spent on overseas aid and each individual togive 1 per cent of his own income for the same purpose,22. A joint manifesto has just been issued by all the leading voluntary bodies in this field, calling for a 1 per cent aid performance by 1972.23.      In the House of Commons some of the best of the younger labour members of Parliament are keenly interested and articulate on thissubject.    They have expressed their concern in an interview with thePrime Minister,24a      Unless we take some steps forward all these people will recognisea growing contradiction between the Labour party  s statements and theLabour Governments performance,,    There will be growingdisillusionment among concerned and intelligent people whorightly identify this issue as one of the most important of ourtime.-5-
Conclusion25, I therefore ask the Cabinet to agree to my proposals for aidexpenditure as set out in paragraph T^above.RoE.P0Ministry of Overseas Development, S. W.L,3rd October. 1969
Extract from Comments of the Chairman of the Development: AssistanceCoinmittee on the 1969 Aid Review of the United KingdomThe key issue of course remains volume.    Here I would first wishto make a retrospective observation on 1967 rather than the year underreview.    The provisional figures for 1967 which fcrmed the basis of lastyearJs review suggested that total United Kingdom flows had rex:aainedsignificantly above 1 per cent of national income.    The revised figuresnow before us show that 1967 was the first year since the beginning of theDevelopment Assistance Committee&apos;s statistical records that the UnitedKingdom&apos;s total flow to developing countries fell below 1 per cent ofnational income,,So far as 1968 is concerned your provisional figures suggest a recovery to above 1 per cent of national income.    More significantlyhowever your official flows again declined in relation to national income.The dollar figures, of course, reflected the devaluation of sterling later in 1967.    But in part this brought the figures closer to their real value,although the change was an abrupt one.    It would seem time to giveserious thought to how and when the 1 per cent of Groes National Producttarget will be reached.    The record of recent years does not encourageone to expect much of an increased contribution from the private sector.Of course I understand the need for the Government to put limits on a broad range of public expenditures, including aid, in the interestsof balance of payments recovery.    It was certainly possible for theinternational community to support sympathetically the policy objectives and measures adopted both before and after devaluation to this end.    Now,around two years later, we note that this programme of balance ofpayments recovery is behind schedule and that therefore the periodof general restraint has to be maintained longer than had been hoped.However, we also note that a dominant contributor to this delay in balance of payments recovery has been a failure - for reasons whichit is not for this letter to comment on - of domestic expenditures, both public and private, to keep within the bounds prescribed.    Aiddisbursements have clearly borne more than a fair share of theburden of restraint.    If, therefore, further restrictive measures are required, I feel that this in itself cannot any longer be accepted as a justification for limiting aid funds to a constant level, especially,of course, since a so-called Constant&apos; aid programme means a decliningvolume of &quot;net&quot; flows in &quot;real&quot; terms.
