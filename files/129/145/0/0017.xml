document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 142 COPY NO,14th October, 1969CABINETOVERSEAS AID expenditure note by the Minister of Overseas DevelopmentMy first task as Minister of Overseas Development has been to study the alternative proposals for overseas aid expenditure from1971-72 onwards contained in the 1969 Public Expenditure survey committee (PESC) Report on which Mr0 Prentice has recentlycirculated a paper C(69) 130,    I find that despite the wholeheartedefforts of my predecessor in office to sustain and increase the officialaid programme, it has in fact continuously and steadily declined sincethe Government took office in 1964,    This is the case whether it ismeasured as a proportion of gross national product or as a proportionof public expenditure.    Indeed,, taking public expenditure deparmental programmes since 1964, overseas aid and defence are the only two whichhave actually been reduced as a proportion of public expenditure.    Underthe Treasury proposals, it would continue to decline well into the 1970s,28      I fully appreciate the balance of payments considerations whichhave up to now provided grounds for the decline and I understand alsothe Chancellor&apos;s reluctance to commit prematurely even a small partof the surplus now in prospects    But the net foreign exchange cost ofa modest increase in the aid programme, which has been assessedinterdepartmentally, would not be high.    Furthermore,, overseas aid is now a fundamental aspect of the international financial scene.Important recent evidence of this is the Report of the Pearson Commisoion,appointed by the World Bank, with its recommendations for aninternational aid strategy for the 1970s involving the early attainment of the 1 per cent UNCTAD target, including a substantial increase inofficial aid programmes,3,      With all these international pressures to increase and improvedevelopment aid programmes, I am convinced that it would be unwiseand wrong for the Government to run down the aid programme m theearly 1970s and announce this intention in the promised December white paper on public expenditure,    A decision of this nature would also be a heavy blow to many Labour supporters and to a large body of informedopinion in this country.**1*4
4,      In these circumstances, I wish my colleagues to know that I most certainly endorse the proposals for an upturn in the aid programmecontained in C(69) 130.J.H.Ministry of Overseas Development, S.W.1.14th October, 1969-2-
