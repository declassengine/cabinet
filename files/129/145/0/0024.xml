CONFIDENTIALCIVIL      AVIATION      POLICYDRAFT WHITE paper.     Civil aviation is one of the world&apos;s fastest growing indus-I tries.     The output of the industry on international scheduledI services alone grew at an average rate of 17% a year over the last ten years, or more than doubled every 5 years.     Part of thisgrowth was accounted for by new airlines, with the result that therelative share of British airlines,  like those of the United States,declined over this period.     Nonetheless the output of Britishairlines on international scheduled services has been doublingevery 5i years while their output on inclusive tour charterservices has grown so rapidly from small beginnings that it was nearly 20 times as great in 1968 as in 1958.      Few industries canmatch this record of sustained expansion and look forward to con-tinuing expansion at high rates for as far ahead as can before seen.2.    This remarkable growth has been the product of two main factors.     The steady decline in the cost of air travel has broughtit within the reach of ever-increasing numbers of people.     Atthe- same time a very rapid rate of technological change has bothreduced costs and enabled larger numbers of people to be carried.The passenger-carrying capacity of the Boeing 747, which will bein transatlantic service in 1970, is at least 5 times that of theComets which inaugurated transatlantic jet services only 11 yearsago, and even larger and more economical aircraft are in prospect.3.    Other and completely new techniques of air transport willmake their impact over the next decade.     The Concorde supersonicairliner will be coming into service.    Aircraft capable of using very short runways may play an increasing role.    Lookingfurther ahead,  there is the possibility of the successfuldevelopment of economic aircraft capable of vertical take-off and landing.    The increase in the size of aircraft hasalready permitted a rapid growth of air freight-traffic andwith the increased use of containers this will continue tobe one of the fastest growing sectors of the industry&apos;s4.    The contribution made by British airlines to the nation&apos;economy depends on their continued growth and prosperity.     Theindustry contributes directly to the balance of payments through its earnings from carrying passengers and freight.     In 196 8 thenet foreign currency earnings of British airlines were  69 million;after allowing for the net earnings of foreign airlines from theUnited Kingdom, the gain to the balance of payments was  20 million.There are opportunities for making this contribution considerably greater in future.     In addition there is the indirect contributionmade by the airlines in attracting foreign tourists to Britain.Less measurable but no less important is the fact that ^ theordinary citizen can now enjoy opportunities - the Mediterraneanholiday, the visit to relatives in other continents - that wereuntil recently the privilege of a minority..business.2
5,    It was against this background that the Government appointed,in July 1967, a Committee of Inquiry into Civil Air Transport with sir Ronald Edwards as Chairman and with the following terms ofreference :-&quot;To inquire into the economic and financial situation and prospects of the British civil air transport industry and into the methodsof regulating competition and of licensingcurrently employed;    and to propose with dueattention to other forms of transport inthis country what changes may &quot;be desirableto enable the industry to make its full contribution to the development of the economy and to the service and safety of the travelling public.&quot;The Government greatly appreciate the valuable work done by theEdwards Committee in bringing into focus the issues that now con-front the industry and in suggesting a course for its development in the coming decade.     The Committee&apos;s Report, which was published on 2nd May 1969, is of outstanding&apos;quality and interest.6.     This Report confirms that British airlines have great achieve-ments to their credit.     BEA and BOAC are both held in &quot;highesteem&quot; by the international airline community.     In spite ofvicissitudes, the profit records of the state-owned airlines havecompared favourably with those of most of their internationalrivals.     British airlines have been innovators, both technicallywith the introduction of jet aircraft and blind landing techniques and commercially, in partnership with the travel industry, in thedevelopment of inclusive tour holidays.     The Committee did not find anything fundamentally wrong in the past record of the industry but did identify some weaknesses that should be corrected for thefuture.     In planning ahead for the seventies, the need is to makethe industry still more efficient and to provide for greater flexibility so that it can meet the challenges that rapid growth and change will bring.7.    This means first dealing with those shortcomings that doexist.     Productivity, for example, has been low compared not onlyI with the United States but also with some leading airlines ini Western Europe.     As the Report shows,  the labour productivity ofBOAC and BEA, taken together, lies in the middle range of western european performance, being surpassed by Alitalia, Lufthansa andKLM;   only the relatively small airlines,  such as Swissair, Sabenaand Iberia appear to have significantly lower labour productivity.These comparisons suggest that considerable room remains for improvement.     The industry&apos;s net foreign currency earnings, thoughhigh, have not kept pace with the growth of activity.     It has alsobecome increasingly apparent that there are weaknesses in the institutional arrangements for regulating the industry.     The airservice licensing system has not worked as well as was hoped whenit was set up in 1960.      Justified criticism has been made of thesystem for appeals.     The basic weakness has been a lack of clarityabout the objectives of civil aviation policy and a lack ofsuitable machinery for acting positively in their pursuit.3
8.     When the Report was published the Board of Trade invitedcomments from all interested parties and the Government havetaken account of the many views expressed in the course of extensive and thorough consultations.     This White Paper isintended to provide a new charter for the industry for the next decade, on the basis of which it can build on past strengths,correct past weaknesses and grasp the immense opportunities thatlie ahead.     After setting out the objectives on which the government&apos;s proposals are based and some of the limitations ontheir freedom of action, the White Paper deals first with the structure of the industry, taking in turn the future organisationof the public sector, the proposed &quot;second force&quot; airline and the structure of regional air services.     The next section dealswith other aspects of economic regulation, including pricing policy,  transport co-ordination,  subsidies, commercial agreements and aerodrome planning.     A further section deals with humanrelations.     The concluding section sets out the Government&apos;intentions for the future regulatory system.4
I. OBJECTIVES9,    In any statement of the objectives of British civil aviationpolicy there is a need to strike a balance which allows theindustry to plan with reasonable confidence and continuity,without imposing a crippling rigidity.    There is also,  as theCommittee pointed out, a need to find a middle course betweenpolicy statements of such wide generality as to be open toalmost any interpretation and those of such detail that theymust inevitably produce a straitjacket within which it isimpossible to adapt to changing and often unpredictablecircumstances.    The Report sets out a number of possible objectives for policy and the Government welcome the emphasis placed on theinterests of-the consumer, on the need for an economic return on investment and for rational pricing policies,  on the safety,of operations and on good conditions for those working in the  .industry.10.   In the Government1 s view the principal objective ofcivil aviation policy must be to encourage the provisionof air services by British carriers,  in satisfaction ofall substantial categories of public demand,- at the lowestlevels of charges consistent with a high standard of safety, .an economic return on investment and the stability.anddevelopment of the industry.   . This&quot; objective must be set inthe context of the need to nelp strengthen the balance ofpayments and contribute to the overall growth of the economy.In setting these objectives for the industry,  the government consider that the minimum of restriction should be imposed on it or on the users of its services, and that arrangements whichrestrain competition or innovation should be tolerated only tothe extent that they are necessary to achieve the main objectives of policy.    Thus, as will appear later in this White Paper,  theGovernment favour the licensing of a second British carrier on ascheduled service route, where it can be shown that suchcompetition would be in the public interest.    Again, where theprices of inclusive tours have to be controlled,  they should beset at levels no higher than is necessary to give adequate protection to competing scheduled services for Which there isa genuine need. .   - -11.   The principle of the minimum of restraint on competition orinnovation can, however,  be applied only within the limits set by airline economics and the practical realities of internationalcivil aviation.    British civil air transport is an internationalindustry, with well, over 90 per cent of its output on internationalservices.    Here its competitive stx-ength is crucial, and here itfakes its greatest contribution both to the economy and thebalance of payments,.   -12.   The industry is,  and will continue to be, highly regulatedthroughout the world for a number of reasons.    First, there isjne need for the highest standards of safety and the need tocontrol aircraft noise.    Second, there is the need for stability    .
and regularity of public transport services.    Lastly, there isthe inescapable fact that international services depend upon anetworlc of agreements reached with, other countries, defining the traffic rights which airlines may enjoy.   The need, therefore,is to operate within this framework in such a way as to give theindustry the biggest possible opportunities in the expandingworld market.    At the same time, however, this framework of regulation can be modified by international bargaining, by both the airlines and the Government.    This applies to fares as well asto traffic rights.    Britain&apos;s international bargaining power is far  rom negligible.13.   The Government will incorporate these broad objectives ina policy statement that will be published and made binding uponthe future regulatory body, to guide its work over the wholespan of its activities.    The rest of this White Paper sets outthe Government&apos; s views on the organisational changes that are needed,  and the policies that should be applied,  in order toreach these objectives.    This more detailed exposition of the ways in which the objectives should be pursued will form the foundation of the policy guidance to the new regulatory body.The Government accept that it may become necessary to varyparts of this guidance from time to time, to. give effect to any changes of emphasis that may be required.
CONFIDENTIALII.    THE STRUCTURE OF THE INDUSTRY14.   The Committee were of the view that, in matters of industrial structure, the wiser course is to create conditions in whichchange can come about naturally over time under the broadstrategic guidance of the regulatory authority, rather than to lay down a rigid and detailed pattern in advance.    Their Report-envisages a future structure in which there will be fewerairlines than there are now.    A smaller number of airlinesoperating in an expanding market should, through greatereconomies of scale and of specialisation, be better placed toincrease their earnings of foreign exchange and to serve thecountry&apos;s transport needs.    The Government agree that structuralchanges should be encouraged, on the broad lines proposed inthe Report.    Greater size should not be pursued to the exclusion of desirable competition;    but both the industry and the economyare likely to be harmed by an excessive fragmentation of effort.15.   The encouragement of - structural changes on the lines now envisaged calls for more purposive regulation of the industry -than the present legislation and licensing system permit.    TheGovernment accept that the task should be carried out by a civil Aviation Authority charged by Statute to act in accordancewith the objectives and policies laid down in the Government*sformal policy statements.    The Civil Aviation Authority will be concerned with the structure of the industry both in itsbroader terms and, more narrowly,  in its decisions on individual routes.    It is the broader structural issues thatare the main concern of Government policy.The public sector16.   The public sector provides nearly 95% of the industry&apos;output on international scheduled services and 70% of the total output of the industry.    It has contributed the main weight ofthe United kingdom&apos;s civil aviation effort over the years andwill continue to do so.    Its organisation is, therefore, of greatimportance.    The two Air Corporations, set up in 1 946 tospecialise respectively in long and short haul operations, haveresponded successfully in different ways to the characteristics of the different markets they were designed to serve and thenature of the competition they meet.    It is crucial to thefuture of the industry that the public sector airlines shouldbe enabled to build on the positions of strength they have achieved in the face of growing international competition and changes in the structure of their markets.17-   The Committee considered how best this objective could beachieved.    The present arrangements have created a naturalrivalry between the two Corporations which has acted as a spurto enterprise and innovation, but which has also led to anindependent and separate approach on some matters on which itwould have been an advantage to have a more co-ordinatedapproach.    The Committee laid great stress on the principlethat no organisation should be made larger than necessary tosecure the major economies of scale and specialisation and onthe virtue of having more than one management group.    Nevertheless,they concluded that more co-ordination was needed than could beachieved by co-operation between the two separate corporations and they recommended the creation of a Holdings Board with fullfinancial responsibility for and extensive powers of control overthe operations of the two Corporations.7
18.    In considering this recommendation, it is essential first to assess the strength of the case for closer integration.    TheCommittee discussed a number of areas in which common action might have brought considerable gains.    They referred to thelarge investment of the Corporations in separate computersystems using entirely different equipment and in separatefreight terminals and they concluded that, under the present arrangements,  there&quot;was a built-in bias towards investment inseparate projects of these kinds.    They thought it important to ensure in future that the case for common facilities, evenif they were not so completely suited to the purposes of oneCorporation, should be fully weighed.19.   The Committee accepted that the indiscriminate amalgamation of engineering units might serve no purpose, but considered thatBOAC and BEA might not be taking in as much of each other&apos;s work as is desirable or might become desirable in future.    They,therefore, recommended continuous and effective study from aninside viewpoint.    The Committee did, however, lay particularstress on the need for close co-operation in the engineeringstudy of future aircraft and flight system requirements.    Twoindependent project groups will each tend to think solely ofthe route structure of its own airline, instead of considering what balance of future aircraft types would create optimalconditions for the two airlines jointly.    Consequently, thebest solution for the public sector&apos;as a whole will never besought.    The Committee, therefore, recommended that projectengineering should be provided as a common service for thepublic sector airlines.    Other fields in which the committee thought that the advantages of greater co-operation deservedclose examination included industrial relations, catering,transport, training, advertising, the handling of inclusivetour charters, and hotel investment.20.   It was, however, in the crucial area of marketing that theCommittee believed the greatest weakness in the present organisation was to be found.    They considered that the public sector airlines should be organised so as to secure the maximumtotal net gain, and that inter-continental and European trafficshould be considered together for this purpose.    So long as eachairline cultivates its separate market, so as to optimise itsown interest, the best overall result may not be achieved.    TheCommittee recognised that full consideration of this issueinvolved discussion about the allocation of routes between BEAand BOAC, about the use of the same aircraft on Atlantic and european flights and about relations with other European airlines -all matters of considerable complexity on which BOAC and BEAheld divergent views.21.   The Government accept that these are powerful argumentscalling for some change in the present organisation to providefor closer co-ordination.    To help them in deciding what formthat change should take, the Board of Trade undertook furtherstudies intended primarily to throw more light on the extent ofthe possible advantages from centralised decision-making in the key areas of marketing through travel, and of fleet Utilisation.The two Corporations co-operated fully in these studies though their views differed on certain issues.    The starting point forthese studies was the same as that adopted by the Committee - thatthe object must be to secure the best aggregate result.    Forexample, the choice of aircraft for use on any single route must
depend largely on the choice made for use on other routes withinthe same system and the potential market on any particular routedepends partly on the market available on other routes whichconnect with it.    The fundamental question to be answered was whether the best results for the public sector airlines as a wholecould be achieved by treating them as a single system, or as two separate systems.22.   The studies suggested that significant gains in aircraftutilisation, and thus lower costs, might be expected in the longer term if the scheduling of aircraft were planned to match a singleintegrated route network rather than two separate systems.    the saving would arise to the extent that fewer aircraft were needed to do the same amount of work.    The opportunity is provided partly by the fact that, although the average stage length on BOACsroutes is much greater than on BEA&apos; s,  each corporation operates on some routes where the stage lengths are similar or are moretypical of the other&apos;s.    Thus some of BEA&apos;s routes might be served as well or better by boac&apos;s long-haul aircraft and some ofBOACs routes by BEA&apos;s medium-haul aircraft.    It can now be economicto use long-haul aircraft, which are usually also larger aircraft,on relatively short stage lengths where traffic densities are sufficiently high, for at least part of their working week.This is confirmed by observation of the activities of many foreignairlines which operate over both long and short stage lengths.In the short term the gains from the integrated scheduling ofBOACs and BEA&apos; s fleets are likely to be relatively small but inthe longer term, as the Committee suggested, greater gains shouldaccrue with the procurement of aircraft to match the greaterscheduling flexibility that an integrated route structure permits.23.   The use of long-haul aircraft over short stages where traffic is dense makes it possible to seek the marketing gains that can beexpected to arise from offering through travel on routes joiningpoints that are at present served separately by the twoCorporations.    This involves not merely a unified selling effortfor connecting services, but the offer of through travel on thesame aircraft, for both passengers and freight, especiallybetween North America and continental Europe.    Since the farefor the transatlantic leg of a through journey is much greaterthan on the European leg, a relatively small increase in thenumber of through passengers would more than offset the loss ofa larger number of passengers on the European sector.    There aretwo aspects to this.    First, through connections by singleBritish aircraft could compete for the large amount of traffic which at present stops en route between North American and european cities.    This is a market that is currently hardlyserved at all by British carriers,  because of the rigid geographicaldivision of function between the two Corporations, which hasdeprived the British civil aviation industry of many of theadvantages of our location astride the. short great circle routes between great centres of population in North America and western europe.    Secondly, although connecting services through london or another point in the United Kingdom even by the same aircraftWuld generally be less attractive than direct flights offered byother airlines at convenient times, the total market is so largethat the small share of it which might be captured where theBritish carrier&apos;s timing was more convenient - or a British flightvas preferred for some other reason - would still represent afurther substantial gain.9
24.   The size in total of the possible gains can be gauged by thetotal value of air traffic in 1968 between the continent ofEurope and the United States -  250 million for passengers andsome  70 million for freight - figures which should be at leasttwice as great by 1973.    The winning of only a modestly increasedshare of this would be of great value particularly at a time whenBOAC, with the introduction of their Jumbo jets, will have greatly increased capacity, and when an increasing proportion oftraffic from the United States is choosing to travel throughgateways other than New York,  at which the United Kingdom hastraffic rights.    As time goes on,  the traffic potential via theUnited Kingdom on any particular route may grow more slowly thantotal traffic on that route, or even decline, with the progressiveintroduction of foreign non-stop services between more and morecity pairs.    Nevertheless,  the potential for British participation in the market:as a whole can be expected to grow with the market,as this justifies the progressive opening up of connectionsbetween more city pairs.25.    It was beyond the purpose of the studies initiated by theBoard of Trade to attempt to decide which routes might be most appropriate at this stage for through operators.    A fullinvestigation and detailed planning of particular operationscould, be done only by the airlines over a period.    Neverthelesspreliminary examination by the airlines of a sample of possibleroutes confirmed that a substantial untapped market existed fromwhich the revenue would be almost entirely in foreign currency.It also suggested that,  even allowing for any additional operating costs on the short sector certain of these routes could be operated profitably.    BEA emphasised certain disadvantages thatmight result from any extensive re-adjustment of routes -particularly the increased risk of late departures from the U.K.where the aircraft began their journeys in North America and somepossible loss of the advantages arising from their specialisationin the techniques of marketing and passenger handling appropriate to the very large numbers who travel on short routes.    TheGovernment, however, consider that there are worthwhile gains tobe had from planning and operating the route networks of the twocorporations in a more integrated manner.10
26.   Against this background, the Government have carefully considered the- Committee&apos;s recommendations for the futurestructure of the public sector and have consulted the corporations and other interested organisations.    The Committee concluded that they could not support  in outright merger and that any form of joint Airline Committee would not be sufficiently strong and effective.    They recommended the establishmentof a Holdings Board-which would have overall financial responsibility for all the decisions of the public sector andwould be &quot;in exactly the same position as a major Holdings board in the private sector&quot;.    At the same time,  they expressed theview that the Holdings Board &quot;should hold the reins lightly&quot;and recommended various safeguards, including a careful balance in the membership of the Holdings Board, designed to preserve the status and identities of the Corporations (and of theirChairmen) and to ensure that the case for any measure ofcentralisation was &quot;proved to a Board, where the majority ofmembers were&apos;associated with particular airlines&quot;.?//.   Both Corporations have criticised this proposal, in theform in which it was put forward, on the grounds that it wouldbe likely to introduce a double layer of decision-making and sogreatly to complicate and prejudice the commercial operations ofthe airline.    Similar views were expressed by a wide range ofother organisations and individuals.    The Chairmen of the corporations might still appear to be the   airline bosses&quot; -as the Committee proposed - but they would be subject to theauthority of the Holdings Board.    There would be a danger ofinternal tensions which might be difficult to resolve.    TheGovernment accept the force of these objections.    The Corporationshave, in the meantime, greatly strengthened the Airline Chairmen&apos;sCommittee, which was established in 1 946, and argue that the major benefits to be gained, from closer working could be achieved through this arrangement.    In the Government&apos;s view, however, itwould be unrealistic to expect the full potential gains fromcloser integration to be achieved if they depended simply onco-operation between two separate Corporations, each with itsown interests to protect and each charged with the duty of earning its own return on capital.28.   In the light of these considerations the Government have considered, whether it would be advantageous to proceed directly to the merger of BOAC and BEA into a single airline. The white paper published by the previous administration in 1 963 on theFinancial Problems of BOAC stated that the arguments for and against such a course were, at that time, finely balanced.    Theevidence available, particularly on changes in the market and in aircraft performance, suggests that the balance has shiftedtowards integration.    The Government are well aware, however, ofthe difficulty that is inherent in studies of this kind, ofbeing certain that all the factors have been correctly assessedand of estimating with complete confidence the gains that mightbe achieved.    The Government share the view of the Committeethat the pace and precise degree of integration &apos;are best judgedby those working within the industry and having responsibilityfor its performance.    While it is clear that the realisation ofthe full benefits must depend on centralised decisions withinthe public sector on major planning and strategic issues, theGovernment share the Committee&apos;s reluctance to sacrifice the operating identities of the two Corporations.11
29.   The effective choice lies between two courses.    The first is to leave BOAC and BEA to continue as at present, but toimpose on them the duty to seek the greatest aggregate benefit for the public sector as a whole and to set up jointinstitutions for this purpose.    It would have to be recognisedthat this could mean one of the two Corporations achievingpoorer results than it might have achieved in isolation, inorder that the other might achieve better.    The second course is to establish a single Airways Board, charged with the task of maximising the aggregate benefit for the public sector, withsubstantially the same powers as were suggested by the Committee,but without the organisational restraints which have been thesubject of particular criticism.    It is this Board that wouldtake all the decisions required to secure that the two airlines&apos;fleets and routes were planned and marketed, to the best overalladvantage;    it would be made clear that it had complete authority and responsibility and would not,  therefore, be acting as anadditional layer of decision-making.    It would include the chairmen of the two Corporations,  and would be responsible forappointing the members of the boards of the Corporations.    TheAirways Board would decide,  in the light of direct knowledge and experience, how far and how fast it would be justified inintegrating the activities of the two airlines.    It would bein a position to make changes quickly to meet changing circurn-stances.    It would be responsible to the Board, of Trade for financial control of the two airlines and for the planning oftheir future investments.    The Airways Board would also be inthe best position to undertake the reorganisation of secondaryservices in the public sector (which are considered later in this section) and other subsidiary activities.30.   The Government accept that the first course might, withdetermination, be made to yield some worthwhile results but aresatisfied that the creation of a single Board would offer thebest assurance that necessary changes were made when and as quickly as they were needed.    Legislation will therefore beintroduced to set up an Airways Board charged, with achieving theoptimum aggregate results oy the Corporations.    BOAC and BEAwill retain their individual identities as operating airlines,but will be subject to the strategic control of the AirwaysBoard.    Although the change inevitably involves some loss of independence and will be unwelcome to some,  the Government are convinced that both airlines will emerge stronger and better ableto compete against their rivals, most of which run both short-hauland long-haul operations.    The new organisational structureshould provide greater career opportunities for those whose skill and work has contributed to the past performance of bothCorporations.    The public sector, and those employed in it,should benefit from the greater scope for the movement of management and staff between both the two airlines and thecentral organisation.Ilhe^independent sector31.   The Government agree with the Committee&apos;s view that therels a place in the industry for both publicly-owned and privately-owned airlines and that there may be a role for an airline group0-f mixed ownership specialising in the provision of regional air services.    They agree also that there should be no attempt to lay down, in quantitative terms, a hard and fast share for eachsector.1 2
32.   Competition and rivalry among airlines can, as the Reportpoints out, make an important contribution to airline efficiency,especially by allowing the consumer to exercise freedom of choice.    There are, of course, practical limitations to the pursuit of these advantages-    The excessive fragmentation of effort must be avoided, and the scope for direct: competitionon particular routes needs to be judged against the volume oftraffic to be carried.      Moreover, as the&quot;Report recognises,our opportunities to designate.a second British carrier are&apos;likely to be limited, by the nature- of our bilateral arrange-liients.     Nonetheless,  the Government accept that the benefits of competition should be actively pursued&apos;wherever the practical considerations allow.33.   One of the more important tasks of the Civil aviation authority will be to keep under review the possibility of licensing a second, carrier on a scheduled service route where this might be expected to increase the British share of themarket or bring other benefits.    In considering any applicationsthe Authority will need to satisfy itself that three conditions   -are met.    First,  the applicant airline should have the skill and resources needed to mount an effective service and. make it viablewithin a reasonable period.    Secondly, the designation of anindependent airline on a route already served, by BOAC or BEAshould not unduly impair the Corporations.1 services, or their capacity to meet the financial obligations laid upon them by theGovernment.    Thirdly,  the net increase in traffic gained by thetwo carriers together and the resulting benefits to consumersand to the balance of payments should more than offset anydiseconomies.    These criteria seem in the short term more likelyto be satisfied on some of the trans-atlaintic routes to theUnited States than elsewhere.    The United Kingdom&apos;s air servicesagreement with the United States allows either party to designate more than one carrier.34-   The Government also agree broadly with the Commitiee&apos;s iews about competition on domestic routes.    There are already twocarriers licensed to serve the trunk routes between London and -Belfast, Edinburgh and Glasgow.    In the longer term, as thevolume of traffic increases, there may be room to license a secondcarrier on other primary routes.    But the main need for theimmediate future is to consolidate the position of the secondcarrier on those routes where competing services already exist,vath a view to the eventual removal of limitations on the frequency of its services.35.   The independent airlines.have progressively increased their share of a rapidly growing air transport market, mainly by developing inclusive tour and other charter services.    Thisevolution has been encouraged by various forms of verticalintegration between airlines and organisers of group travel;    inthis way economies of scale and of specialisation have been gained.    The Committee forecast a continuing expansion in thesesectors, especially for long-haul services.    Freight charterservices will also become increasingly important.    The Governmentforesee a promising future for airlines specialising in thesesectors, provided that they have the necessary financial strength and managerial competence.36.   The changing nature of the market, to which the Report draws attention, implies a continuing evolution in the character ofair services and a progressive change in the balance between
scheduled and&quot; charter services on international routes.    Themain scheduled&apos; carriers will engage increasingly in charteroperations, either directly or through subsidiaries.    Conversely,the scope for specialist non-scheduled carriers will increasethrough changes in pricing policies and in the character of services needed on particular routes.37.   One of the ways in which the structure of all sectors ofthe industry may be strengthened is through mergers.    The CivilAviation Authority will encourage or facilitate mergers thatseem likely to strengthen the industry in pursuit of the general objectives without unduly impairing competition.    The formal statement of policy will provide for the Authority to actwithin the terms of the Governments general policy on mergers andto consult the Board of Trade on those proposed mergers which fall within the provisions of the Monopolies and Mergers Act, 1 965.A &quot;second force&quot; airline38.   The Report recommends that the private sector of the industry should be encouraged to form, by the amalgamation of two or more   .existing independent carriers, a &quot;second force&quot; airline thatwould fill the role of second flag carrier on internationalroutes.    It is to this new airline that the Civil aviation authority would give preference in allocating such licences for international scheduled services as are assigned to the independentsector of the industry.39.   The Government would welcome the emergence of such a newairline if it resulted in the strengthening of the industry asa whole and contributed to the realisation of the government&apos;s policy objectives.      They agree, with the Committee1 s view thatthe establishment of a &quot;second force&quot; airline will almost certainly take some time.    A new airline of this kind mustevolve progressively, proving itself at each stage.      It isfor the airlines to decide, in the exercise of their commercial judgment and in the light of market forces, whether and in whatways to come together.      It will be for the Civil aviation authority to judge whether any combination of airlines willbefitted for a particular role, and to scrutinise each routeapplication on its merits within the framework of the Governmentsstatement of objectives and policy.40.   The Committee made an estimate of the scale of operationsthat a &quot;second force&quot; airline might need to achieve by about1975 , if it was to have a reasonable prospect of long-termviability in the highly competitive conditions that it would face.   This estimate was based on assumptions about the types of aircraft that would need to be employed and the numbers of eachtype that it would be economic to operate.    A variety of such estimates can be made, depending on different assumptions about       *the future size and character of the market, the mix of routes and of activities in which the airline would engage, the types of aircraft that would be required and a host of other factors.It does not follow that the scale of operations needed toProvide employment for a fleet of given size must necessarily becontributed wholly, or in any specified proportion, by scheduled services.   Such evidence as there is suggests that the viabilityof an airline depends on a number of factors, of which size islot necessarily the most important.    Certainly there is nouniquely &quot;right&quot; size or pattern of services that a &quot;secondforce&quot; airline would need to achieve in order to be successful,
41,   The Government cannot accept that the formation of a&quot;second, force&quot; airline should be made conditional upon thetransfer to it of a significant part of the Air Corporations&apos;route networks , as distinct from double designation in appro-priate cases.     The Committee emphasised that territorialconcessions must be limited.      Some reallocation or readjustmentof routes, which.might include some exchange of routes, would notbe ruled out where,  in the judgment, of the Civil Aviation Authority,this would benefit the international competitiveness of the industry as a whole and the balance of payments.      Such changes in routepatterns must be considered in the context of the overall contri-bution of the industry to the objectives of civil aviation policy.These are matters to be determined by the Authority in the lightof detailed study and argument and the Government do not intend to impose a preconceived reallocation of routes on any airline,which has borne the cost of developing the routes and is servingthem well.42.   The Report proposes that the Board controlling the public sector should secure its own stake in the &quot;second force&quot; airlinethrough share participation or convertible loan stock.      TheGovernment recognise certain attractions in this proposal butconsider that on balance it would make it more difficult to achieve the full benefits of competition,  and that it would be inappropriate to use public funds in this way.      There are ampleprecedents for co-operation between airlines, where this would bein the national interest, without one having a stake in the other;nor is such a link necessary in order to secure effective communi-cation on policy matters between the &quot;second force&quot; airline andthe Board of Trade.Regional air services43.   The Report makes an important distinction between the primary and secondary networks of scheduled air services.      The primarynetwork, which comprises the great bulk of international routestogether with the domestic trunk routes, can be distinguished by;the larger volume of traffic, which is reflected in the increasinguse of the larger jet aircraft.     The primary network includes theroutes between London and Belfast, Edinburgh and Glasgow and otherroutes connecting the main international gateways.      The secondarynetwork comprises mainly domestic services together with certainrelated services mainly linking regional airports with the nearerparts of Continental Europe.      This network in general requires the use of smaller aircraft, of types that are decreasingly useful in other sectors of the market, and to a growing extent those air-lines which engage in both primary and secondary services need tomaintain separate aircraft fleets and organisations for the twopurposes.      In addition there are services of a more local character,^ploying very small aircraft of limited range and capacity, whichI% conveniently be described as third level services,jy Domestic air services within the United Kingdom have a longhstory of instability resulting from high costs and inadequatereturns.     This is attributable to a number of factors, including* shortness of average stage lengths, the low volume of trafficCONFIDENTIAL
on&apos;many routes, difficulties of securing adequate aircraftutilisation and increasing competition from surface transport.Many operators have found it impractical to run a domesticscheduled service network as a self-supporting business andhave cross-subsidised their domestic operations from their earnings on inclusive tour charter services.      Since the Reportappeared,  the continuing difficulties faced by operators in this sector have been illustrated by the decision of Autair Inter-national Airways to discontinue domestic operations after theend of October 1969 and to concentrate entirely on its profitableand expanding charter activities, and by the fact that british air Services Limited, which controls BK&apos;S and Cambrian, has been going through a difficult period.45.   The Report recognises that the future viability of the secondary, mainly domestic, services demands a measure of routerationalisation together with some concentration of the structure of the airlines concerned,  so as to allow economies of scale andof specialisation to be achieved.      It is probably also important to work towards more economical standards of service, so as to offset the intrinsically high cost structure of low-densityshort-haul operations.      The need is for coherent route structure-tures, a scale of operations that will permit high levels of aircraft utilisation, and the elimination: of frills without anysacrifice of safety or efficiency.46.   The Report recommends that a new regional airline group should be formed round the nucleus of British Air ServicesLimited, a subsidiary of BEA in which there is a minorityprivate shareholding.      BEA&apos;s secondary services would betransferred to the BAS group, so as to form a nucleus that other airlines might join.      It will in any event be necessaryto undertake an early reorganisation of the BAS group.       TheGovernment accept the underlying concept of the Committee&apos;recommendation that there should be a regional airline orairline group as a separate subsidiary of the Airways Board,that would bring together all BEA1s domestic services otherthan those which can be regarded as forming an integralextension of its primary international network, and routesserved by BAS.      The precise allocation of resources betweenthe primary and regional networks and the reconstruction of BASwill need to be studied in detail before final decisions are made.This will be an important task for the Airways Board, at leastduring the initial stages of the development of the regionalairline group.47.   The Report recommends, and the Government accept, that otherairlines should be. free to join the new regional airline group,provided that any investment in such acquisitions by the groupcould be expected to show an acceptable return within a reasonable period.     The Government also accept that the new regional airlineshould not have a complete monopoly or powers of compulsory acquisition.    The scope for further acquisitions will thus belimited, since the nucleus comprising BFJA&apos;s secondary servicesand those of BAS will already provide about 70% of total output in this sector.      It is clear that some airlines now engaged inthis sector may wish to retain, their independence and the Govern-ment would not wish to prevent this.      Indeed there might be room for more than one airline group to evolve under the supervisionPx the Civil Aviation Authority. .16
48,   The Report envisages that the new public sector regionalairline should have the structure of a holding company controllinga number of subsidiaries with close regional affinities, and thatthere should be private equity participation at both group and subsidiary levels.     The Government are content that an appro-priate structure should be allowed -to evolve under the controlof the Airways Board and under the supervision of the CivilAviation Authority.49,   The Government foresee a significant and growing role forthird level services,  such as already exist, for example, inScotland,  the South West of England and the Channel Islands.50.   The Civil Aviation Authority will have a major responsibility in studying and promoting the rationalisation of regional services,in particular through the examination with the airlines of thescope for route rationalisation and the encouragement ofco-operation.      The Government accept the need for appropriatepricing policies to be evolved.     It will also be for the Authorityto ensure that, while the needs of the regions for services to theContinent are fully recognised, there will.be the minimum of diversion of traffic from British flag carriers to the long-haulservices of foreign airlines.     The Authority will consult theauthorities of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man insofar as structural changes in domestic services may affect their interests;    the Government will discuss with the Islandauthorities what machinery should be established for thispurpose.17

III.      ECONOMIC POLICY51.   The Report draws attention to a number of matters that are less directly related to the structure of the industry but arenonetheless of prime importance for its wellbeing and for the realisation of the general objectives.      The Civil aviation authority will play a major role in- the study and applicationof policies in these fields, including the primary responsibilityfor conducting or initiating basic research where this has beenlacking in the past.      In some instances the Authority will havesole responsibility, in others it will contribute to more widely-concerted efforts.Pricing52.   The Report advocates progress towards a more rational pricestructure for the industry as closely related to costs as can beachieved.      The Committee were well aware of the practical con-straints and of the fact that changes in pricing policy must be gradual.      In the international field this country cannot actunilaterally,  although it can have a point of view which, overtime, it might persuade others to share.     The Government   accept these views and recognise the need to evolve pricing and licensingcriteria that will correspond more closely to market conditions asthey develop.      This is a task for the Civil Aviation Authority,which will be directed to establish appropriate consultativearrangements with all sections of the industry and with users of air services.Cross-subsidisation53.   The Government accept that, as a guiding principle for the longer term, air fares should so far as possible reflect the longrun marginal costs of producing the services in question, properallowance being made for the cost of capital.     in the longrun ground costs should,  so far as practicable, be.fullytaken into account.        .     This does not preclude the cross-subsidisation by existing profitable services of new routes thatare in the development stage, provided that these new routes arelikely to become self-supporting within a reasonably short time.Where, however, particular services are cross-subsidised on a continuing basis, this indicates that there may be a misallocationof resources that should be rectified.      The same principle applieto the prices charged for different classes and categories oftravel.     It argues also for a greater readiness to allow faredifferentials according to the type of aircraft used (as forexample between jet and turbo-prop aircraft or as between super-sonic and subsonic aircraft) and for the greater use ofdifferentials related to the hour of -travel and the lengtn ofbooking period required.domestic fares and freight rates^*   The Civil Aviation Authority will inherit from the air transport Licensing Board the responsibility for establishing the United Kingdom domestic air tariff.     The Authority will berequired to observe the Government&apos;s policies for the control ofPrices.     The Government will retain the power to refer increases^domestic air fares and freight rates to the National Board for&quot;rices and Incomes in appropriate cases.18CONFIDENTIAL
Triglusive tour ,prices55.   It will also be the responsibility of the Authority to control the minimum prices of inclusive tour holidays to the extent thatthis continues to be necessary.      The Government agree with theCommittee that the distinction between scheduled and non-scheduled services is changing&quot;.     They accept that inclusive tour prices mustin general be related to public fares on scheduled services,  butagree that they do not need to be identical, or indeed that theremust be a relationship, in every case,      The two main criteria are that the structure of prices for inclusive tours, where these are controlled,  should be internally coherent and. that their levelsshould be no higher than is&apos; necessary to give adequate protection to competing scheduled services for which there is a genuine need.56.   The Report argues that a scheduled carrier has an impliedobligation to serve his routes with a frequency and capacitysufficient to ensure that, on average,  the demand for seats isadequately met at reasonably short notice and with a reasonablechoice of timings.      The non-scheduled, carrier has, in this sense,a lesser obligation.      It follows that a scheduled service, opera-ting as it must at a relatively lower average load factor than a charter service will be costlier to run. The report goes on to argue that, where the demand for scheduled services warrants,it is right to protect the scheduled carrier from the effects oflover priced charter competition, for example by setting minimum prices for charter inclusive tours and imposing restrictions onthe types of traffic that can be carried at uncontrolled prices.But there may be routes where the pattern of demand does not justify the protection of scheduled services in these ways and where it would be sensible to remove existing restrictions.    Inthe words of the Report: scheduled services should only begiven a protected status where there is a clear need for this type of public facility,,&quot;57.   Progress in this direction cannot be fast.     First, a detailedroute-by-route examination is needed to find out where the pattern of demand is such as to allow the present degree of protection tobe reduced or perhaps removed.      This will be a task for the CivilAviation Authority.    Secondly,  the United Kingdom can only move in concert with other countries.58-   In the intervening period progress can be made on the linesof the tariff for the 1970 summer season of inclusive tour holidaysin Europe, which was announced last July after consultation withthe Air Transport Licensing Board and the industry.     This tariffis designed, to encourage off-peak travel, to develop traffic onthe longer European routes and to reduce the adverse differentialQn inclusive tours departing from the provinces.      This is theKst recent of a series of changes in the structure of inclusive.tour control prices, which have already borne fruit in terms of increased traffic for both scheduled and non-scheduled carriers,with corresponding benefits to consumers.53.   It should now be possible to begin to extend these policies to the prices of inclusive tours to destinations outside Europe.The provisions governing affinity group travel will also come under review.19CONFIDENTIAL
international fares60.   International scheduled service fares and freight rates areregulated in the context of agreements with other countries forthe exchange of traffic rights.     The closely-meshed nature ofthe world network of air routes had led. to arrangements for thesettling of the tariffs through the mechanism of the international air Transport Association rather than by a multiplicity of bilateral negotiations.      It is impracticable for one country toact in isolation.    The Report accepts that, despite its limiia-tions and shortcomings,  there is no ready alternative to thissystem but recommends that the United Kingdom should play a moreforceful   role in these matters.61.   The Government accept that the pursuit of more positivepricing policies generally must imply a more vigorous approach,through argument and persuasion,  in IATA and in inter-governmentaldiscussions.     United Kingdom airlines play an influential partin IATA&apos;s deliberations and it is right that they should use their influence to further the objectives and policies laid down for the industry as a whole.     To this end the Authority will play its part, in concert with the Board of Trade, in guidingthe airlines concerned as to the objectives they should pursue,in ample time to influence the proposals they table in IATA.62.   The Board of Trade,  in discharging its continuing respon-sibility for international relations in the Civil Aviation field,will retain its present responsibility for giving or withholding&apos;approval of IATA tariff resolutions and for negotiations withother governments on tariff matters.      In carrying out these functions the Board of Trade will act in close consultation withthe, Authority at all stages and each will have the benefit of theother&apos;s advice.Transport-co-ordination63.    Transport services within the United Kingdom have to be viewed as a whole if the best use is to be made of available resources in competition with rival investment needs.      In thelong run, the key to the optimum allocation of resources will bethe adoption of appropriate pricing policies throughout thetransport sector and the policies set out in paragraph 54 aboverepresent a useful contribution towards this objective.64-    So far as investment in domestic transport involves public funds, the total, amount to be allocated to the transport sector and its allocation within that sector must ,remain the Government&apos;responsibility,  acting with the advice,  among others, of the CivilAviation Authority,  the Airways Board,  the Freight IntegrationCouncil and the Regional Economic Planning Councils.      The adop-tion and pursuit of appropriate pricing policies will provide a uniform measure of the scope and need for private investment in domestic air services and, in conjunction with standard investmentcriteria, a basic tool for the co-ordination of public investmentso as to avoid wasteful duplication.^5-    In carrying out its responsibilities regarding routelicensing, fares and aerodrome planning, the Authority will haveRegard to the pattern of planned investment in all forms ofinternal transport and in particular to the implications of technological innovation.      To this end the existing government machinery for consultation on these matters will be extended toinclude the Authority and machinery will be further developed for consultation between the Authority and other manorLransport interests. 9n &quot; J
Subsidies66.   The structural changes proposed for secondary services,services,  together with changes in pricing policies,  shouldenhance the viability of air services to the regions.      TheGovernment recognise, however, that despite these changesthere may still be certain routes or route networks that could not attract sufficient traffic to permit viableoperation for a number of years or for the foreseeable future.     Air services can often play an important partin the total transport and communications pattern of the regions and may indeed be essential where alternative meansof transport are inadequate.      The Government therefore acceptthe Committee1s conclusion that the development of certain air services may need to be subsidised, where this would contribute to the economic and social development of the regions.67-   The Report points out, however,  that no conclusive linkhas yet been demonstrated between the provision of air servicesand the pace of regional economic development.      Such evidence as there is suggests that the existence or lack of air services may not be a major consideration in most industrial locationdecisions, which must necessarily take account of a host ofother factors. Accordingly the Government consider that thefirst task must be to develop methods of&apos; assessing the economicand social benefits that might accrue from the provision ofparticular air services.      Before determining the amount ofany subsidy that might be justified on these grounds,  it willbe necessary to analyse the operating economics of the airlinesconcerned,  the current and potential traffic flows, the influence of pricing policies and the impact of the structural changesforeshadowed in the previous section of this White Paper,    Onlythen will the Government be able to judge the strength of thecase for subsidising any particular service in the light of their general policies for transport co-ordination and regional development..68.    These economic studies will be an important task for theCivil Aviation Authority to undertake,  in an advisory capacity,in conjunction with the Government departments concerned and inconsultation with regional and local authorities.      In view ofthe importance of this task, preliminary studies, building on work that has already been done in related fields, will be putin hand without waiting for the introduction of the legislationestablishing the new Authority.69.    If,  in the light of these studies,  it is decided that an air service should be subsidised from public funds, then it is accepted that the subsidy should be direct in relation tothat service.      This is preferable to the present situation,in which air services are often cross-subsidised on a con-tinuing basis by other more profitable services or areindirectly and indiscriminately subsidised in the sense thataerodrome and ground service costs are not fully recovered.Nor is it the Governments intention that support should begiven by taking air services into the public sector and runningthem on a continuing basis at less than an acceptable rate of return.      Primary domestic routes and international services from the United Kingdom will not be eligible for subsidies andthe United Kingdom cannot be expected to subsidise holidayroutes to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.21CONFIDENTIAL
70.    The Report suggests that subsidies should be financed bythe reallocation to air services of funds already allocated to regional development, on the basis of recommendations Dy regional authorities.    Financial assistance to regional development isgiven for particular purposes and is not allocated among the regions in predetermined amounts.      There are also other respects in which the legislative provisions and machinery for regional development assistance do not easily lend themselves to a schemesuch as the Report proposes.     The Government accept the principlethat regional authorities should advise on the relative priori-ties to be accorded to the support of air services and other forms of transport: in and between their regions but it must remain the Government1s responsibility to decide on the amount and source of public funds that should be made available both in total and in individual cases.     In so doing the Government willtake account of the progress being made towards the full recovery of the costs.of aerodrome and technical services,  as well as the impact that a particular subsidy might have on other forms oftransport.    The Government also agree that a proportion of thecost of any .subsidy should in principle be borne by the communi-ties and local interests that benefit from the service and thatthe airline concerned should have every incentive to eliminatelosses within a reasonably short period.      In particular, account must be taken of any benefit to the airline from interliningtraffic and of-the likely growth of total traffic on the route.71.   The Government will seek powers to grant subsidies, where these are shown to be justified, in legislation to be introduced as soon as possible.      It is clear, however, that the payment of subsidies, which must depend on the conclusion of the necessarystudies, cannot begin immediately.      Subsidisation and ration-alisation must go hand in hand and, as the Report makes clear,some time will be needed.       The maintenance of services duringthe interim period must in general remain, as hitherto, a matter for the commercial judgment of the airlines concerned, with such assistance as may be given by the communities and local interests that benefit.      In the public sector, domestic services that are running at a loss will normally be kept going only where thereis a prospect of their being made profitable within a reasonable period.    There may, however,  be instances in which interim arrangements to keep services going will need to be considered on their merits.72.   The Government recognise that the geography of the ScottishHighlands and Islands sets limits to possible improvements inalternative means of transport,  so that there are special grounds for ensuring the continuation of essential air services in this area.     These services will continue to be supported by cross-subsidisation, the incomplete recovery of aerodrome costs and non-recovery of ground service costs until alternative arrangements are made.73.   The Civil Aviation Advisory Committees have been making animportant contribution to the formation of civil aviation policy.The Government accept, however,  that in the new environment their non-statutory functions should be transferred to the regional economic Planning Councils and that the Advisory Committees should then be discontinued.22
Commercial agreements74.   The Government agree with the Committee&apos;s view that poolingand other commercial agreements may often be in the publicinterest.      In some cases,  such agreements are mandatory underthe United Kingdom&apos;s Air Services Agreements with other countriesor are necessary to permit the fullest development of Britishairlines&apos; services.     Co-operation between pool partners in suchmatters as the&apos;scheduling of flights may well result in thegreatest aggregate benefit to the airlines concerned,  to the economy and to the consumer.      In some cases, however, commercialagreements may have the effect of muting competition,  impairingefficiency, lowering the standards of service to the public ordetracting from the country&apos;s overall economic interest.75.   The Government agree,  therefore, with the Committee&apos;s viewthat this is an area where constant vigilance is needed.     Theyconsider that all commercial agreements should be filed with theCivil Aviation Authority and be subject to review. In examiningsuch agreements, the Authority will be guided by the Board ofTrade as to the international and general policy implications of any action that it might take or recommend.Aerodrome planning and pricing76..   The Government accept the view of the Committee thatresearch into aerodrome planning should be accelerated.     Asthe Report recognises, the effective power to implement plansrests with aerodrome owners and the Government accept theCommittee&apos;s view that there is insufficient case for reversingthe policy of successive Governments on aerodrome ownership.Nevertheless they agree that the preparation and publicationof studies on aerodrome planning will be of great benefit to owners and other authorities concerned with aerodrome develop-ment.     It will be a responsibility of the Civil aviation authority to study the requirements for aerodromes to match the development of air services.     The Government will, however,&quot;remain responsible for the allocation of public funds by way of direct or indirect subsidies, in this field as in the field of domestic air services.      Nor do the Government intend in this context to change the legislation governing land use planning,since aerodrome development affects much wider interests thanthose of civil aviation alone..77.   The Report recommends that aerodrome charges should besubject to approval by the same body that is responsible forthe regulation of air fares.     Aerodrome owners are to someextent in a monopoly position and aerodrome charges are relevant to the fixing of air fares,  the development of regional air services and the examination of the need for subsidies to begiven in certain cases.      The Government therefore agree thatthe Civil Aviation Authority should be given the task of advising the Board of Trade on the structure and levels of aerodromecharges.     To this end the Government will set out their pricing policy for aerodromes, reflecting the guiding principle in para-graph 54 above,  in their formal policy statement;    the authority will be instructed to have due regard, in framing their recommend-ations,  to the financial objectives set by the Government for theBrit ish Airports Authority and to the international implications of changes in airport charges.     Aerodrome owners will have thesame opportunities as airlines to challenge the Authority1 srecommendations, where these appear to conflict with the declared policy. 23
Aircraft procurement and finance78.   The aircraft manufacturing industry has its own importantplace in the British economy.      The Government is closely concernedwith its success in selling its products in the widest possiblemarkets and with its earnings of foreign exchange.     Where the costand risks of launching a promising new aircraft design are beyondthe industry&apos;s capacity, Government assistance is at present giventhrough launching aid schemes, provided it can be demonstrated that the project satisfies certain strict economic criteria so thatthere is a good prospect of recovering the investment through alevy   on sales.      Such assistance must, in objective and in administration, be distinguished from policies designed to foster the development of civil aviation.     It is already inherent inGovernment policy that any support for the development of british aircraft should be given directly to the manufacturing industry.The Government welcome the CommitteeVs reaffirmation of this principle.79.   The Government have carefully considered the recommendations in the Report on finance for aircraft purchase and the eligibilityof aircraft ;?:)c investment grants.     The Governments policies for civil air transport are intended to strengthen the industry and improve its financial stability and return.     There is no reasonto expect that efficient airlines earning a commercial, rate of return will be unable to call on the financial facilities they need in order to renew and expand their fleets, without additionalGovernment assistance being required.     The Government thereforesee no reason to change the decision, which they took in 1966,in general to exclude investment in the services sector (includinginvestment in aircraft)  from the scope of the investment grants scheme.     Nor do they see any reason to seek to extend to UnitedKingdom airlines the arrangements for fixed-rate Government-guaranteed bank credit that apply to British shipowners&apos; purchases of British ships.Air Transport Association80.   The Government welcome the recommendation that the industry should establish an Air Transport Association to facilitate con-sultation between the industry and the Government, the CivilAviation Authority and users of air transport services.24CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIV. HUMAN RELATIONS81.   The Government welcome the Committee&apos;s constructive approach to human relations questions and in particular the emphasis placedon the value of consultation and the need for proper negotiating machinery.    They accept the recommendation that all airlines shouldbe placed under the same obligation as are the Air Corporations,by virtue of Section 23 of the Air Corporations Act 1967, regardingnegotiating and consultative machinery.,    Provision for this willbe made in the Bill to establish the Civil Aviation Authority.This will provide for the Authority, when considering an airline&apos;sentitlement to operate,  to satisfy itself that the airline hascomplied with this obligation.    This will be analogous to theprovisions requiring the Authority to satisfy itself that anairline has adequate financial resources, competent management and the ability to operate safely.82.   The Government share the Committee&apos;s hope that the industry of the future will offer stability of employment and attractivecareer opportunities, and welcome the Committee&apos;s view that high levels of labour productivity are essential not only for theindustry&apos;s wellbeing in an increasingly competitive environmentbut also as a basis to afford high levels &apos; of pay to skilled and efficient staff.    In the Government&apos;s view,  levels of pay shouldreflect the employees&apos; contributions to productivity as well asdifferences between airlines as to the character and responsibilityof employees&apos;  tasks, and this will preclude absolute uniformity of pay rates.   Accordingly the Government intend to amend Section15 of the Civil Aviation Act 1949 to make it clear that,  ininterpreting the obligation under Section 15(1), regard should be had to the terms and conditions of employment .as a whole observed by the Corporations and those observed by the independent undertakings.83.   The Government attach importance to the role of theNational Joint Council for Civil Air Transport, not only as aforum for the negotiation of terms and conditions of employmentbut also for its: contribution to the promotion of increased productivity.   They reaffirm their desire that the airlines inmembership of the Council should be more fully representativeof the industry.Participation84.   The Government share the Committees view that a sense ofemployee participation is important.    The Government recognisethat the most effective method of participation is throughmembership of a trade union which negotiates on all questions affecting conditions of employment;    they are also in favourof experiments in the appointment of workers&apos; representatives to the boards of undertakings.    The Government hope that the airlines, some of which have been leaders in the developmentof productivity bargaining, will show similar enterprise in^vising new forms of staff participation and involvement.25
VTHEAUTHORITYRconomic regulation35.   The Report identifies some shortcomings in the presentmachinery for the economic regulation of civil air transport.There is no doubt that,  if this machinery were to continue, inits present form,  a number of changes would be needed.    TheGovernment share the Committee&apos;s view that the Air TransportLicensing Board has ably acquitted itself within the limitsset by the legislative framework, although these limits andthe way in which they have been interpreted prevented the emergence of a broad strategy for the industry on the linesoriginally hoped.86.   The Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act 1960 limited not onlythe range of the Air Transport Licensing Board&apos;s responsibilitiesbut also the practical scope for it to play a formative role.It was a   weakness, as the Report points out,  that the objectives of British civil aviation policy were not set clown more fully asa guide to action.    The tendency has been for the Licensing board to await applications and to grant those which satisfied alimited number of very general criteria.   -87.   In the present White Paper,  the Government are setting out a broad strategic framework as a guide both to the futureregulatory authority, and to the industry.    The adoption of the objectives and policies set out in this White Paper willrequire the new regulatory body to act positively in pursuit ofthe Government1s declared objectives and policies.    It will needsometimes to take the initiative rather than just to respond tothe initiatives of applicant airlines.    Clearly the need to choose between competing claims to serve particular routes willremain but in future the basis for selection will be different.The future regulatory body will be responsible, within the termsof the Government&apos;s declared policy, for shaping route networksand for measures to strengthen the industry&apos;s structure.    It willhave to consider what roles are needed and are available forairlines to perform and the ability of particular airlines to perform them.    This will involve a more discriminating approachthan has hitherto obtained.    It will sometimes be necessary, forexample,  explicitly to close a sector of activity to new entrants,or to encourage or discourage certain kinds of diversification byairlines.88.   in this and in other respects there will need to be a continuing dialogue between the regulatory body and the industry as a basis for forward planning.    The relationship will need tobe consultative and not confined to the formal hearing of evidence and argument.    The working out of the details of Government policy,over the very broad range of matters covered in the Report and inthis White Paper, will involve guidance and advice as well asdirection.    The programme of basic research to be undertaken bythe new body will lead to a better understanding of the environmentlfi which the industry operates, for the industry*s benefit as wellas the Government.&apos;s.26CIVIL AVIATION
89.    The Government believe that the economic regulation of theindustry should continue to be carried out by an expert body thatis not subject to detailed supervision by Ministers in its day today decisions and which, therefore, should lie outside the normalframework of a Government department.    As the Report points out,a separate body can speak authoritatively both to and for theindustry.    Within the discretion allowed it by the Government&apos;sformal policy statement and directives, detailed decisions can betaken with full knowledge and understanding and with the,undividedattention that the Minister in charge of a busy department cannothope to give.Safety and Technical Regulation90.   The Report stresses the inter-relationship between theeconomic, operational and technical regulation of the industry.All aspects of airline activity have a bearing on the safety ofthe services provided to the public.    Conversely,  the achievement of high standards of safety imposes an economic cost which needs to be taken fully into account both in creating the conditions inwhich airlines can operate profitably and in assessing the ability of an airline to fill a particular role.    The morepurposive direction of economic regulation which the government now intend to adopt will make it more important to take accountof these relationships.    The quality of decisions, both about anairline&apos;s capacity and performance and about the course of future developments, will be improved if the regulatory authority has thefullest possible knowledge and understanding of all aspects ofairline activity.91.   There are close links between the work on operationalsafety, which is at present the responsibility of the director general of Safety and Operations, and the work of the NationalAir Traffic Control Services, which both at present come withinthe Board of Trade (the latter jointly with the Ministry ofDefence).    With technical advance,  there are also increasinglyclose links between the operational safety work at presentconducted by the Board of Trade and the work on airworthinessconducted by the Air Registration Board;    indeed, the AirRegistration Board has recently suggested that there might be acase for combining some of these functions.    The several aspectsof operational regulation - the certification of airworthiness,the rules governing the flying of aircraft, the testing of professional competence, the assessment of an airline&apos;s ability to operate safely and the control of aircraft movements - areinterlocking aspects of a single operating environment.92.   For these reasons, the Government accept that the enhancedeconomic functions should be carried oirt, in accordance with apublished policy directive, by a regulatory authority outsidethe normal departmental machinery;    that this authority shouldcombine with these functions responsibility for the operationalregulation of the industry;    and that all the operational andtechnical functions should be brought together within the samebody.   They accept, therefore, that there should be a singleCivil Aviation Authority having responsibility for the wholespectrum of economic, operational and technical regulation,including responsibility for airworthiness and for the non-Nilitary aspect of the air traffic control services.    A singlebody with responsibility over this whole field would be in theDest position to form coherent judgments both on the activitiesof individual airlines and on the developments which will bestserve the national interest in this rapidly expanding industry.27CONFIDENTIAL
93.   The Civil Aviation Authority will be able to develop a comprehensive expertise in all aspects of the industry&apos;s affairs.As such, it would be well placed to attract staff of the manyprofessional skills required.    A larger organisation such as thiswould be able to offer better career prospects to many of itshighly skilled and specialised personnel, who would gain theopportunity to broaden their fields of specialisation by movingbetween areas of work that are at present in separate compartments.fcAt the same time, as the Report points out, there would be a&apos;continuity of experience that the Civil Service is less able to guarantee.    Provision will be made for some movement of staffbetween the Authority and Government Departments;.94.    In reaching this decision,  the Government recognise thatcertain problems will require solution and that adjustments will &apos;have to be made.    In particular the separation of policy-makingfrom its execution will require the maintenance of the closestcontacts between the Board of Trade and the Authority at all times, and. both will be involved together in a number of importantactivities. -95.   In accepting the recommendation that the responsibilityfor airworthiness should be brought within the Authority, theGovernment intend no reflection on the Air Registration Board&apos;spast performance.    The Board justly enjoys a high regard through-out the world and the Government are anxious that the scope and character of the Board&apos;s relations with the manufacturing and operating industries should not be impaired.    The Government willbe concerned therefore, to ensure a minimum of disturbance eitherto the present internal organisation of the Air RegistrationBoard or to the present arrangements for consultations with out-side interests.    The Authority will draw on.the.same sources of advice as are at present available to the A.R.B.96. &apos; The National Air Traffic Control Service has the duty bothof controlling aircraft movements and also of accommodatingdifferent categories of users within the United Kingdom&apos;s limitedairspace.    Approximately half the aircraft based in this country are civil, and half are engaged on defence duties, with aircraftmovements in about the same proportion.    The needs of the various categories of civil users and of defence are different and oftenconflicting.    The resolution of these conflicting requirements fedemands a combined approach to the use of the United Kingdom&apos;s air-&quot;space as a whole, and it was for this reason that the National air traffic Control Service was set up in 1 962 as a joint defence and civil body.    The confidence of all users of the air in its impart-iality and ability to take the national view is important to its success.   The Service will continue to operate on an integrated andlnational basis and will be responsible jointly to the Ministry of   FDefence and to the Civil Aviation Authority.    The appointment of     Ithe Controller, who may be either a civilian or a serving officer,and other senior officers will as now be made jointly with the ministry of Defence. The Authority, in taking over from the Board 1of Trade the responsibility for providing the civil component of 1the joint Service will be subject to the Governments direction on Inatters affecting the balance between civil needs and those of defence. I97.   In taking over the safety of aircraft operations and responsi-bility for the civil side of air traffic control, the Authority wil&quot;acquire certain responsibilities in relation to general aviation an&quot;ill not be solely concerned with commercial airline operations.The Governments formal statement of policy will include guidance to the  Authority in matters affecting aerial work and private flying.28
The Constitution of the Civil Aviation Authority98.    The Civil Aviation Authority will be established as a body corporate governed by a Board appointed by the Board of Trade.This Board will comprise members with executive responsibilitiestogether with independent members.    The intention is that oneindependent member should have special responsibility for theinterests of consumers.99. The decisions of the Authority will be decisions of itsBoard, subject to any measure of delegation that may beprovided, for.    The Authority will conduct formal hearings of applications for air service licences in appropriate cases;the procedures governing such hearings will come under thegeneral supervision of the Council on. Tribunals.    Because ofthe executive responsibilities of most Board members, it is envisaged that hearings will take place before the full Boardonly in cases of major significance.100. The Government accept the recommendation that a systemof pre-hearings should be introduced, provided that this doesnot result in two levels of decision.    The pre-hearingprocedures will be concerned with the clarification of the issues and the evidence to be heard,  so as to expedite formalhearings.The Policy statement and appeals101. As stated in paragraph 13 above, the Government accept that their objectives and policies for the industry shouldfrom time to time be set out in a published statement.    they also.accept the recommendation that such statements should bemade binding upon the Authority by giving them a suitablyformal status and submitting them to Parliament for approval.They propose therefore to make provision, in the Act establishing the Authority, for statements of policy to be made by means of appropriate instruments.102. The Government recognise that stability and continuity ofpolicy are important for the ordered development of the industryand accept, therefore,  that changes should be relativelyinfrequent.    Subject to certain provisions for specific direct-ives to the Authority discussed below, they accept that the declared objectives and policies should be amended only by wayof similar formal procedures.103. The Government share the view that the S3/-stem of appealsestablished by the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act 1960 hasundermined the authoritative character of the licensing body.They accept the recommendation that the grounds on which anappeal may be made against a decision of the Authority inmatters of air service licences should be limited to the issueof the consistency of such a decision with the declared policy.104. The Government accept that an aggrieved party should beable, as at present, to object to a decision of the authority on grounds of vires and to seek a prerogative writ so as to29
bring procedural defects before the Courts;    but they seedifficulty in the further recommendations that the Courtsor a judicial tribunal should, hear an appeal on the issue ofthe consistency of a decision with -the declared policy.    the formal policy statement, being concerned with essentiallyeconomic criteria,  is unlikely to be expressed in terms lendingthemselves to judicial interpretation.    The consistency of theAuthority&apos;s decisions with the policy can best be judged by theBoard of Trade, which will have drawn up the policy statement in the first place.105. Accordingly the Government propose that a party to a casedecided by the Authority,  in a matter of air service licensing,should have the right to refer the matter to the Board of trade on the grounds that the decision cannot reasonably be brought within the terms of the Governments&apos; statement of policy.In order to limit abuse of this procedure, the Board ofTrade would take the power to vary the decision,  at their discretion, only if in their opinion the decision was notconsistent with the policy then in force.106. The Government also accept that the Board of Trade    shouldbe empowered to suspend, action on a case,  in a matter of airservice licensing,  on giving notice that it presented issues ofpolicy which they wished to consider.    This power would be exercisable either before or after the Authority had reached its decision and even though the Authority&apos;s decision,  if reached, was within the terms of the policy then in force.    This power isnecessary to ensure that the policy can be adapted from time totime in order to meet changed situations,  as well as to ensurethe long-term consistency of the Authority&apos;s decisions with theGovernment&apos;s and Parliament&apos;s intentions.    This is,  however,  areserve power to be used sparingly and only when a major changeof policy is called for.Air Service licences107.   The adoption of more purposive regulatory policies on thelines described in paragraph 88 and the bringing together ofeconomic and operational regulation under a single Board willdemand an early reappraisal of the forms and categories of airservice licences.     Among the points to be considered are the kinds of air services that need to be licensed, the extent&apos;towhich they should each be licensed separately and the way inwhich requirements bearing on tour operators should be giveneffect.      In particular it will be necessary to define the way in which the licensing system should reflect the duty of theCivil Aviation Authority to satisfy itself as to an airline &apos;general competence, .its ability to operate safely, the adequacy of its financial resources and its compliance with the requirementregarding the establishment of or participation in appropriateindustrial negotiating machinery, before allowing it to engagem commercial airline operations.     One aspect of this questionis the need to commodity the. present arrangements, under which anairline that has not passed some of these tests may nonethelessengage in exempt services of a commercial   character.     The30
Government will direct the Authority to keep these matters undercontinuing review, bearing in mind the need for the simplicityand reasonable stability of the licensing arrangements.The allocation of functions108. In accepting the concept of a Civil Aviation Authority onthe lines proposed in the Report,  the Government are acceptingalso the broad complex of functions that the Report proposes theAuthority should discharge.    There are, however, certain exceptions and qualifications.109. The Report recommends that the Authority should be in aposition to carry the main weight of international trafficrights negotiations in most cases,  in association with theForeign and Commonwealth Office, but recognises that the Boardof Trade, which will remain responsible for general civilaviation policy, must reserve the right to concern itself withthese.    There is force and merit in this proposal since theinterrelation between route licensing and other decisions ofeconomic regulation on the one hand and the negotiation ofinternational traffic rights on the other is so close that thesame body should be intimately involved in both.110. The Government consider, however, that international legislation on civil aviation, as on other subjects, must remain the responsibility of Ministers and that it would be neitherappropriate nor practicable to charge the Authority with the dutyof conducting international discussions whether on traffic rightsor on such other civil aviation matters as the acceptance anddischarge of obligations under the Chicago Convention.    since these are specialised areas closely related to aviation policy the Government propose that they should, as in the past, be primarily the responsibility of the Board of Trade advised bythe Authority.    The Board of Trade will have the power to givespecific directions to the Authority where this is necessary tosecure the implementation of international obligations.111. Nonetheless it is desirable that the Authority should beintimately associated with the Board of Trade in these matters.The Government intend that the Authority should have an advisoryrole in the negotiation of traffic rights and should provide in appropriate cases members of the United Kingdom delegationfor international negotiations and meetings.    In other mattersonly the Authority will be able to provide the specialistrepresentation in international discussions.    Accordinglyarrangements will be made for the Authority to participate in international negotiations and in the proceedings of international organisations, and in appropriate cases to represent theUnited Kingdom in those matters.112.The Report recommends that the Authority should have theresponsibility for the control of aircraft noise. Most noiseabatement measures impose some degree of penalty on aviation.Considerations of technical, feasibility, compatibility withsafety, and the economic penalties, must be of direct concern to the Authority, but the Government have a duty to ensure thata balance is maintained between the interests of the industryan^ the amenity of the public.    It would not be sufficient to&apos;:&apos;:&apos;31  -
rely on the terms of a general policy directive.    The mainresponsibility for noise abatement must therefore remainvith the Board of Trade, consulting the Authority where appropriate,  and with the power to issue and publish directions to the Authority to implement particular noise abatement measures.113. The Authority will not be empowered to make subordinate legislation but will be the principal source of advice to theBoard of Trade in the making of such legislation in the safety,technical and operational fields.    The Authority will, however,have powers to make bye-laws in certain cases,  subject to confirmation by the Board of Trade, together with powers toimpose conditions or requirements in connection with the grantof licences or other permissions.    The Board of Trade will retain a small staff with understanding of safety and operationalmatters sufficient to advi.se on policy and on legislation matters.114. As part of its overall responsibility for safety matters,the Authority will have responsibility for the licensing of aerodromes. Management and operation of the Highlands and Islandsaerodromes and of Aberdeen depend to a substantial degree on services provided by personnel of the National Air traffic control Service and of the Civil Aviation Office for Scotland.Since both these organisations will be transferred to the CivilAviation Authority it is expedient also to transfer the ownership and management of these aerodromes.    The; Government will look to the Civil Aviation Authority in conjunction v/ith the AirwaysBoard, to study and make recommendations?, on the future ownership and management of this group having regard to economies whichmight result from common control with the associated air services.It is possible that at the time when the Civil Aviation authority is set up one or two other civil aerodromes will remain in the ownership of the Board of Trade.    The Board of Trade will continue,in accordance with long-standing Government policy,  to seek totransfer ownership or management of these aerodromes to otherresponsible bodies on reasonable terms.115. The Report emphasises the need for the Authority to probemore thoroughly the financial and managerial resources ofairlines and also the need for the fuller publication of financialand statistical data.    In particular the Report recommends that financial results should be reported, in a standard form.    TheGovernment accept that the Authority will need to obtain full and up-to-date returns and will empower it both to obtain and to publish such information in respect of airlines and the organisersof inclusive tours.    Arrangements will be made for co-co-ordination between the Authority and. the Government Statistical Service.    TheGovernment regard the publication of fuller information as being of considerable, importance so that the public may be able to judge the performance of the industry as well as that of the Authority^in exercise of its stewardship.116. The steady evolution, of interlocking arrangements betweenairlines and the organisers of group travel, together with the emphasis placed in the general objective on the interests of theconsumer, require that the Authority should be in a position to
satisfy itself that adequate arrangements have been made tosafeguard the public against bbo risks consequent upon thefinancial failure of organiser^of group travel involvingair transport and, if necessarfjf to require the furnishingof appropriate guarantees.Financial contro&apos;1117- The annual expenditure of the Authority is likely to beabout  25 million,  the greater part of this figure beingaccounted for by the provision of air navigation services andother technical services.    The Authority will be financed,partly by fees and charges for its services, many of which arealready so financed,  in whole or in part&quot;, and partly by theprovision of services on contract to Government departments.Where and for so long as costs cannot bra fully recovered inthese ways, fincince will be provided by means of grants from public funds, their size being determined, in advance by thefinancial objectives which the Government will set the Authorityfor each of its main areas of activity.118. The long term objective must be for the Authority to recover the full cost of its services in all cases in which thatis appropriate.    The pace towards full cost recovery of en route navigational services will depend on the outcome ofinternational discussions and in this case it will be necessaryfor the Board of Trade to approve the proposed charges.    where possible, however, the Authority will be permitted to determineits own fees and charges, in the light of the financial objectives set for it by the Government and bearing in mind the discipline imposed by limited and pre-determined grants.    within these controls and the Governments prices and incomes policy the Authority will be able to enjoy the maximum degree of freedom in the way it discharges its responsibilities.119-    The Authority will be required to employ modern management&apos;techniques and, where appropriate,  to produce accounts on acommercial basis.      The accounts, after audit by the comptroller and Auditor General, will be presented to Parliament with theAuthority&apos;s Annual Report.33.CONFIDENTIAL
The Authority as a constitutional innovation120. The Government have been moved by the need to find the best solution to the problems of the civil aviation industry.    they recognise that the establishment of a Civil Aviation authority on the lines proposed involves a number of constitutional andadministrative innovations.    Within the- terms of the declared policy, the Authority will have a substantial discretion andtheee will be effective limitations on the ability of the Boardof Trade to intervene in the Authority&apos;s detailed decisions,whether on their own initiative or on the initiative ofaggrieved parties.121. The Authority will not, however, be a completely independent body.   The essential feature of its status will be the separationbetween policy formation and the detailed application ofpolicy.    In the latter functions the Authority will have a widediscretion, but there will be ample provision to ensure that itdoes not exceed that discretion. . The formation of the policy will remain the responsibility of Ministers before parliament and that policy, and any changes in it, will have to be declaredand approved.    The Board of Trade will retain direct responsibiliin matters that involve wider considerations than the authority would be competent to decide - international matters, the controlof aircraft, noise,  the siting of aerodromes,  the making of subordinate legislation and the co-ordination of the militaryand civil interests in air traffic control.    But in each of thesereserved functions the Authority will have its contribution tomake in partnership with the Board of Trade and other departments of Government.12-2. The Authority will have to be in a position to justify its performance to the Board of Trade, Parliament and the public.It will have to show,  in its annual reports and publishedresults, that it is carrying out its responsibilities in pursuit of the objectives and in implementation of the policies laid downIt will be accountable against prescribed standards of financialperformance and its actions will be subject to supervision by theCouncil on Tribunals.    The ultimate criterion will be the extentto which the industry thrives and the public are served under theAuthority&apos;s stewardship.34CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALVI.   SUMMARY:    THE SHAPE OF THE FUTURE123.     The principal objective of civil aviation policy must beto encourage the provision of air services by British carriers,in satisfaction of all substantial categories of public demand,at the lowest level of charges consistent with a high standardof safety, an economic return on investment and the stability and development of the industry.      This objective must be set in the context of the need to help strengthen the balance ofpayments and contribute to the overall growth of the economy.124.     The Government will create the conditions necessary tostrengthen the structure of the industry.      They will establish an Airways Board controlling the public sector airlines, andcharged with the task of securing that the fleets and routes ofBOAC and BEA are planned and marketed to the best overall advantageThis Board will have complete authority and responsibility andwill not  therefore, represent an additional layer of decision-making .125.     There is a continuing and promising role for independentairlines having the necessary financial strength and managerialcompetence.      The Government favour the licensing of a secondBritish carrier on scheduled service routes where certain criteriaare satisfied.      The Government would also welcome the emergence of a &quot;second force&quot; airline, formed by the amalgamation of twoor more existing independent carriers, but cannot accept that theformation of such an airline should be made conditional upon thetransfer to it of a significant part of the Air Corporations 1route networks .126.     The Government accept the need to strengthen the structure and improve the viability of regional air services through   theformation of a regional airline or airline group.127.     The Government accept the need for more rational pricingpolicies and for a more active role in relation to I ATA.      TheGovernment accept that it may be necessary to subsidise certainair services that contribute to the economic and social develop-ment of the regions.      They will seek powers to grant subsidieswhere these are shown to be justified in the light of detailedeconomic studies..128.     The Government welcome the constructive approach of theEdwards Committee to human relations questions and will providefor the obligations now placed on the Air Corporations to beextended to cover all airlines.129.     The Government will establish a Civil Aviation Authorityto regulate the whole economic, operational and technicalenvironment of the industry within the terms of a publishedstatement of objectives and policies.     The Authority will implement the more positive economic policies that are now to be followed andwill be responsible also for all aspects of air safety.     Onthese matters, it will deal on the same basis with all public and private sector airlines.      There will be a limited right of appealto the Board of Trade, on grounds that a decision cannot reasonablybebrought within the terms of the policy then in force.35
130.     The Board of Trade will be responsible for laying down the objectives and policies for the industry as a whole and forseeing that the Authority carries them out.      The Board of trade will continue to exercise its present functions in relation tothe Airways Board and the British Airports Authority.      It willcontinue to bear the main responsibility for negotiating inter-national agreements, affecting civil aviation, for the investigation of accidents and for the control of aircraft noise.131.     The Government are confident that these changes will enablethe industry to meet the challenge of the future and to increeiseits contribution to an expanding economy.36     .CONFIDENTIAL
