The attached revised draft of the action ofthe White Paper on the low-paid worker attempts to do this and I thoughtit would be helpful for my colleagues to have seen this before our discussion.    I am not asking for detailed approval of the draft atthis stage, which still requires a good deal more work.Department of Employment and Productivity, S. W.l.19th November, 1969
AJNNjBXExcerpt from draft White Paper on Policy for Productivity,Praoea and IncomesLOW PAID WORKERSOne of the weaknesses of the system of free colleotivo bargaining hasbeen its inability to solve the problem of the low paid.   There are several reasons for this.     Moat of the low paid are poorly organised and ovenwhere they are organised they do not command economic power.   That is oneof the reasons why they are badly paid.   Under a system where wage increases go to the strong, the low paid have little hope of holding theirown, let alone moving up tho economic scale,2.     One of the main aims of any productivity, prices and incomes policy must be to remedy this failure of a free-for-all system.   Throughout theperiod since 196&quot;5, the policy has always provided opportunities for improving the relative position of the low paid.   Under the criteria laiddown, for instance, in the White Paper Command 3590v. which governed theuse of the powers of the 1968 Act, low poy was held to be an automaticjustification for increases up to the ceiling - and above the ceiling whereother workers in the group wore willing to let the low paid have priority.But the decision bo give that priority was left to the employers and unions concerned and as a result, although the gap between low paid and higher paid workers narrowed slightly, it was not greatly reduced.3.   . The challenge which faces us as a socially just society is what stepswe can now take to eradicate the scandal of low pay in an affluent society.This will call for a conscious, deliberate effort by all those involved -G-overnment,   employers and trado unions.   The first stop must be to identify who are the low paid and why they are low paid.     Here theDepartment of Employment and Productivity has already taken the initiativeby launching in September 1968 a new Earnings Survey covering all industries and occupations and designed to discover the exact distributionof earnings behind the averages by occupation, age and region.   It hasalso sought to identify some reasons for low pay;   whether for e.g. it is associated with any particular age level, with payments in kind or withmental or physical disability.   Tho survey, a comprehensive analysis of whose findings v/ill be published shortly, shows that in 1968 one in
every 10 adult male manual workers in this country had total earningsfor a full week of  15 a week or less, at a time when the &quot;average&quot;worker was earning  24.     The position of women was much worse; one inevery 4 adult women had earnings for a full week of  10 a week or less.But in analysing these figures it found that rlthough certain occupationshave a particularly large proportion of workers below these levels(farm work, catering, cleaning, hairdressing distribution and gardeningare the most obvious), the great majority of low paid workers arescattered throughout industries which are as a whole highly paid.   It shows,too, that the reasons for low pay vary fron group to group, almost from individual to individual (and that in some cases the reasons for low pay would be difficult to overcome).     The problem therefore is far toocomplex to be met by blanket increases covering a whole occupation or industry,4.     How, then, is it to be solved?   The first need is to strengthen tradeunion organisation among these low paid groups and this will be one of the aims of the Industrial Relations Bill.   Many of the occupations wherelow pay predominates are at present covered by Wages Councils and it is arguable that this protection, -which was once essential, actually militatestoday against the development of effective voluntary collective bargaining.The Industrial Relations Bill will make it possible to modify the WagesCouncil machinery where this has become desirable in the workers&apos; interests.5.   &apos; Secondly, many groups of workers are low paid simply because theirproductivity is low.     Much could be done by employers, with the co-operation of unions, to change working methods and so help the low paid to achieve higher earnings by sharply raising their productivity.   Here again the Government has given a lead by the emphasis it has laid on the productivity aspects of the policy.     In its reports the PIB has spelt outthe possibilities this has offered the lower paid in a whole range of activities such as agriculture, the retail drapery trade, local governmentand the National Health Service.   In some cases good progress has beenmade in applying the Board&apos;s suggestions; for instance, in the new wagesstructure for agriculture.   In others management still seems unaware of, or indifferent to, the new techniques required.   One of the tasks of-2-
the department s MPS has been to help management and unions to follow up the possibilities opened up by the Board&apos;s reports and the G-overninentintends that the MPS shall play an increasingly active role in seeing that the proposals of the Board and of its successor for improving the productivity - and therefore the earnings - of the low paid are follov/odup urgently.6.     But when all this has been done the solution of this problem will still depend primarily on the attitude of the negotiators in industry.There can be no improvement in the position of the low paid, eitherrelatively, or in real terms, if every increase they win then becomes anew &quot;floor&quot; on which the existing spread of rates of pay is re-erectedautomatically, thus engendering, not social justice, but inflation.The only hope of tho low paid lies in a conscious decision by their fellowworkers that they will accept a re-assessment of differentials bothbetween different industries and within an industry.   There are, of course,differentials which are fully justified, such as those which reflectadditional responsibilities or reward the acquisition of new skills.   Butthis is by no means true in every case and that is why the G-overnment haswelcomed the increasing application of &quot;job evaluation&quot;, not only in manufacturing industry but for such groups as local government manual workers and ancillary workers in the MIS.la     Even with job evaluation, however, the question still remains as to how great the spread should be between rates and whether, in wage negotiations, the greatest emphasis should be laid on the claims of the skilled or on fixing a socially just standard of living for those at the bottom end of the scale.   One of the most effective ways of helping thelow paid is to give priority to the improvement of minimum earnings levelsas has been done in the recent wage agreement of the motor vehicleretail and repairing trade.   Minimum earnings levels are a feature of anumber of nationally negotiated wage structures, for e.g. in engineering,rubber manufacturing and the food manufacturing industries and ifincreases are concentrated more on workers below these levels than on those above, the low paid benefit.-3-

8. In drawing up its guideline of a range of 3 per cent-5 per cent within which pay increases in the coming year should fall the Government recognises that the needs of many groups of low paid workers cannot be met within this range. It believes that at this stage of the policy more radical improvements in the position of the low paid are needed than the normal range for other workers would allow. But if higher increases than 5 per cent are to be accepted for some of the most poorly paid, the result must inevitably be inflationary unless first, every effort is made to match these increases with increased productivity and secondly, other workers who have forged ahead in recent years voluntarily accept more modest increases than 5 per cent for themselves. If they do not, the result will be the very price increases they are most anxious to avoid. The choice is theirs.

9. In recent years there has been increasing pressure on the Government to redress the inequalities of a system of free collective bargaining by introducing a statutory national minimum wage or minimum earnings levels. As a first step the Government set up an inter-departmental working party to study the implications of a national minimum wage and its report provides the basis for the informed discussions which the Government now hopes will take place. The study shows the complexity of the problem of helping the low-income groups. For instance about two-thirds of the households in the country with on income of less than Â£15 a week would not benefit from a national minimum wage as they do not contain any wage earners. Again, a national minimum would have a very uneven effect in relieving poverty because it could not take account of family circumstances. The question of low pay cannot therefore be separated from social service policy. But an even greater difficulty arises from the fact that, although many low paid workers are concentrated in small industries where the general level of pay is low, by far the greater number are scattered through larger industries where the general level of pay is high. If therefore, other wage earners in these well-paid industries merely took the establishment of a national minimum as a new base on which to rebuild their existing differentials, the effects on the cost of living could be disastrous.


10.   Unfortunately there is at present little evidence that higher paid workers would, not take advantage for their own purposes of the attempt tohelp the low-paid through the establishment by lav; of a national minirnun.The recent wage claims, for instance, by dustmen and firemen aroused agood deal of public sympathy in the belief that the pay of these groups of essential workers had fallen behind those of workers in manufacturing industry.11 *   Yet once their increases had been granted, other large claims were immediately pressed by higher paid workers in industry on the grounds that what was fair for the dustmen was fair for the rest.   It is for thisreason that the Government believes the introduction of a statutorynational minimum requires much greater discussion with industry and a clear acceptance by the trade union movement of the need to limit itsrepercussions on wage rates elsewhere.   Without this, the whole operation would be self-defeating.12.   In the meantime, however, progress can and should be made towardsimproving the position of the low paid by other means.   Ti/hat is needed isa study in depth of how this can be achieved in the context of particularsituations and particular systems of pay negotiation.   The government intends to ask the PIB and its successor to initiate investigations intothose cases where low pay is a major problem and to suggest the means bywhich progress can be made case by case, industry by industry.     its recommendations will become an integral part of the operation of thepolicy in the coming months.13*   As has already been indicated, the majority of low paid formcomparatively small r-ockets in industries which as a whole arc relativelywell paid.   In those cases it should be possible for steps to be taken toraise their standards within wage agreements falling within the normal range for pay settlements.   The PIB will be asked to advise how this could be done.   In other industries, like agriculture, the general paylevel is low and can only be improved by settlements above the normal range.   That is why the Government has recently approved a wage increaseof 8g- por cent for farm workers who, as tho NMW report points out, arcby far the lowest paid of the occupations covered.   Since, however, the-5-
numbers involved in these industries form a small part of the total labour force, increases above the normal range here should not mean an intolerable addition to the wages bill provided, that workers in non-low14o   It is this approach which will guide the G-overnment in dealing withits own employees in the public services.   The G-overnment has alwaysrejected the concept that a productivity prices and incomes policy should bear more harshly on the public services than on private industry.During the greater part of I968 considerable success wa,s achieved in keeping all pay settlements within the terms of the policy, but in recent months the succession of high pay claims in the public services hasreflected the belief that workers in these services were falling behindthose in private industry and there was a good deal of public sympathy fortheir demands because these groups contained a number of low paid.   In thecoming months it will be the G-overnment1 s intention to apply the policy asfairly and as firmly in the public services as it is seeking to have itapplied elsewhere.15.   About one-third of all low paid men and one-quarter of low paid womenv/ork in the public services.   This is a challenge both to the G-overnment asemployer and to the trade unions.   The Government will be prepared toexamine this problem with the unions to see how these levels of low paycan be improved on lines similar to those indicated above for private industry.   The G-overnment will however expect that the bulk of the pay settlements shall fall within the normal range.   It will therefore be for theunions to decide whether and to what extent they are prepared to co-operate in giving priority to the low paid.16.   The problem of low pay cannot be settled simply or easily.   some people are low paid because they arc young and inexperienced; others becausethey have passed their productive peak.   Some workers prefer low paid jobsbecause they are less exacting and more suited to their limited abilitiesand therefore their best hope of retaining a place in the labour market.Again, rates which are adequate for a single man may mean poverty for a family.   The needs of these groups can only bo met by a co-ordinated attackon their problems through the social services as well as wages policy.-6-co nfs dents al

17. But there are also groups of low paid who have been unjustifiably left behind in the scramble of wage bargaining. The Government invites unions and employers to join with it in working out solutions to their needs within the context of the policy outlined above. Only in this way can social justice be achieved without imperilling our economic recovery.
