annex draft paragraphs for inclusion in the Prime Minister^ speech duringthe Debate on the AddressSo far as the administration of justice is concerned, the sealwill be put on all that has been achieved by major legislation tn beintroduced to implement the report cf the Beeching Royal Commissionon our judicial institutions.    It is not only the fact that there has been pratically no change in the arrangements for holding Assistss andQuarter Sessions since Plantagen^t times: more serious, the law&apos;sdelays have become intolerable in criminal and civil courts alike,and in recent years we have been moving closer and closer to a breakdown in the administration of justice,,The Government accept the recommendations of Beeching,while leaving for consultation certain detailed recommendations about the siting of the new courts to be established.    I hope these consultations can be speedy as well as forward-looking, so that as quickly as possible we can introduce the legislation for bringing thenew structure into being.
