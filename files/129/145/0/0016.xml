DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)The Cabinet invited me to arrange for officials to make detailed proposals in order to put into effect our decision tc trim the public expenditure programmes for 197.1-72 so as to reduce demand by 300 million (CC(69) 44th Conclusions, Minute 3, Conclusion (2)),The aim was to do this by means of reductions cf about  350 million in expenditure terms,    P.ather more than half was to come from the nationalised industries and defence and the rest from the civilprogrammes; and local government current expenditure was tobe taken into account in finding the reductions from the civil programmes,2,      Discussions at official level have been held between the treasury and the spending Departments individually and in the interdepartmentalPublic Expenditure Survey Committee, all ministers positions being reserved,    The possible changes in expenditure plans which have been identified on this basis amount to a total of just over  350 million, andI estimate that, assuming all the items to be adopted, the effect wouldbe to reduce demand by the  300 million specified in our remit.    Thiswill still leave the total of civil and defence programmes 3, 7 per cent higher in 1971-72 than in 1970-71 on a constant price basis.    Includingnationalised industries&apos; investment, total public sector expenditure would increase by about 3, 2 per cent over this period,    (Projectionson a constant price basis will understate the share of national resources which existing policies will pre-empt, since, on balance, prices risefaster in the public sector than in the private sector.    To allow forthis fact (the &quot;relative price effect&quot;), about ^ per cent would need tobe added to the percentage increases given in this paragraph^ so thatthe total of civil and defence programmes would rise in 1971-72 by about4j per cent and total public sector expenditure by just under 4 per cent).C(69) 141,14th October. 1969CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE; 1971-72Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

The resulting ratesof increase or decrease in the main programmes, compared with thepreceding year as we have decided it, are shown in the Annex to this paper, together with the corresponding rates as they were in theoriginal 1969 Survey Report (SEP(69) 64).The Defence Budget and the Nationalised Industries4.      If I can be assured of a reduction of  60 million in the defence budget, I propose that the reductions in nationalised industries&apos; capital investment should be sought from -(a) The Gas Industry&apos;s programme -  10 million.(b) British railways basic programme -  10 million,,
Civil Programmes(a) Local authorities1 current expenditure .      We did not consider any major changes in plans for localauthorities&apos; current expenditure for 1970-71 because the Rate SupportGrants for that year have already been settled.    But for 1971-72 and later years these Grants have yet to be negotiated.    The proposal isto restrict the rate of growth of local authorities&apos; current expenditurein 1971-72 from the 5 per cent implied in the Survey to 4 per cent.(The rates of increase given in this paragraph take no account ofthe Relative Price Effect).    This involves an overall reduction ofabout  34 million, and entails making it clear to local authorities that the next Rate Support Grant negotiations will be related to a4 per cent average rate cf increase in current expenditure on their various services.    Tins would be above the rate of growth for public expenditure as a whole that could be presented as compatible with the objective - put forward as a planning assumption in &quot;The Task Ahead&quot;(Chapter 5, paragraph 7) and repeated several times since - that therate of growth in public expenditure should be broadly in line with thegrowth of national resources as a whole.    Nevertheless, on the basis that the average rate of increase in the rest of public sector expenditure,as reduced to conform with our remit to officials, would be about 3 percent, I regard 4 per cent as a realistic basis for negotiating the n&apos; XtRate Support Grant settlements.    4 per cent is, for instance, only slightly below the rate of growth shown in the 1969 Survey for localauthorities1 current expenditure on education, which accounts for over half the totaL    There is an issue as to how precisely to apportion thelast few million pounds between services in presenting statistically areduction of some  34 million on a total of some  3, 500 million oflocal authorities&quot; current expenditure, but I cannot believe that thisis a serious stumbling block to determining the total of the reduction to be sought from the grand total of the expenditure.(b) Other c iyil exp enditur e60      The measures identified in officials&apos; discussions, on the basisexplained in paragraph 2, comprise the following reductions (apart fromone or two small items which are still being examined)?  million(l)        Other Overseas Services 0.3(2)       Transport (other than roads and public lighting) 3, 7(3)       Agriculture (land purchase for farm amalgamations,and horticultural markets) 10 2(4)       Housing and Local Environmental Services (on capital) 37.3
  millionLaw and Order (mainly on capital from police and Fire Services)2.5(6)Health and Welfare (capital)3o(7)Social Security (by making the 1971 uprating ons say,1st November, instead of 1st October as assumed in the 1969 Survey)19.0(8)Commons Services (Government building)68 PlThese reductions are expected to have relatively high demand effects,the main exception being the reduction in social security which wouldbe only about a third of the saving in expenditure terms.7.      I recognise that the Department of Health and Social Securitysee the possibility of a short postponement of the 1971 uprating as analternative in the event of other items being found unacceptable, ratherthan as an item to be considered in the first instance.    Moreover, itwould in principle result in higher expenditure in the subsequent period than if there were no postponement^    (In principle a month1 s postpone-ment would so affect the factors taken into account in upratings that additional expenditure would be incurred in 1972-73 of  14 million andin 1973-74 of  7 million.    In practice, however, these effects mightwell be lost in the rounding of benefit rates up or down to completeshillings).    On the other hand, a postponement of one month in the1971 uprating would not be difficult administrativelyj and a saving of  19 million in 1971-72 from the postponement would be valuablein trimming the aggregate growth of public expenditure in that yearto a rate not likely to be out of line with the growth of resources asa whole a8.      I am aware that some of my colleagues feel that there are strong arguments for additional expenditure on certain services.    If these areto be pressed, then I reserve my right to suggest further reductions, inaddition to those referred to in this paper.conclusion. I recommend as the means of putting our decision on 1971-72 intoeffect that programmes should be reduced as in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6.R.H, J.Treasury Chambers^ SaVt/&apos;.l.13th October, 1969
