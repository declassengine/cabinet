C(69) 127 \ COPY NO.    (j V3rd October, 1969CABINETREPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON LOCALGOVERNMENT IN SCOTLANDMemorandumby the Secretrry of State for ScotlandStatement of Government Attitude.When the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Governmentin Scotland was published on 25th September, a Press announcement wasmade from the Prime Ministers Office thanking the Commission for their work, and promising urgent study with early consultations.    As soon as parliament resumes, it will be necessary to supplement this announce-ment with a preliminary statement of the Government^ attitude to theReport,2.       Since the basic findings of the Scottish Commission are the sameas those of the English Commission - that local government needs majorrationalisation, that the number of executive authorities must beradically reduced, and that the division between town and country should be ended - this statement can suitably be on the same lines as the statement made by the Prime Minister when the English report was published,    A draft of such a statement is annexed;  it will beconsidered by the Ministerial Committee on Local government reorganisation on 6th October, and any amendments agreed bythe Committee will be reported orally to the Cabinet.3,,      I attach particular importance to explicit recognition atthe outset that there may be differences between the patterns finallyadopted for Scotland, England, and Waless and the penultimate paragraphof the draft statement seeks to make this clear.    It is I think more appropriate for tins to be said by the Prime Minister than by a Ministerparticularly associated with one of the three countries, and I have proceeded on this basis.    I hope it will be possible for him to makethe statement when Parliament resumes on Monday, 13th October, v/henI have in any event to answer a question by Mr. Gordon Campbell seeking a statement of this kind.W.R.Scottish Office, S.W.1,3rd October, 1969IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOVERNMENT)
ANNEX g&quot;E^I43k^4MiLISSIpH: OMOCAL^G-OVEBN&amp;IENJ? IN SCOTLANDDRAFT PARLIAMENTARY - STATSMTWith your- permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Government, inScotland which was published,  together with a short version,on 25 SeptembersHon. Members have by now had an opportunity to study therox)ort, and will have been impressed by the comprehensivetreatment which the Commission has given to this important and complex subject.     Lord &quot;meatley and his colleagues have alreadybeen thanked by the Government for their work, and i am sure that this House will also wish to acknowledge its great indebted-ness to them.The structure of Scottish local government has evolved overmany centuries-     The earliest of the burghs received theirr-oyal charters in the first half of the twelfth century;    and since then the system has developed and expanded in piecemealfashion as population increased and local authorities were givenresponsibility for the provision of new servicest.     Reorganisa-tion Acts of 1889 and 1929 laid the foundation of the present structure, and few would claim that it can now deal adequatelywith all the demands which are made upon it0The Report proposes to replace the present system by a two-level structure, consisting of 7 regional and 37 districtauthorities:    these k-k authorities would assume the functionsof the existing 430 county, town and district councils.     This- / proposal-
proposal is made in order to satisfy two essential requirements:first, the need for authorities with sufficient resources and power to enable them to provide services effectively;    and secondly, the need for local people to understand and to feelrinvolved in the operation of the democratic process.      TheCommission recommends that the regional authorities should exercise the major functions with the heavy expenditure,including strategic planning, transportation and roads, housing,education, the personal social services, and the police and fire services;    and that the main responsibility of thedistrict authorities should he to plan and develop the localenvironment.    It proposes also that, at a more local level,communities which so wish should be able to form community councils to express local opinion and to provide certain localfacilities.On the major principles the Commission are unanimous.Two Commissioners (the Hon. Members for East Renfrewshire andInverness) dissent from the majority recommendation aboutdistrict authorities.    They believe that local planning shouldbe the responsibility of the regional, and not the district,authorities, and that if this were accepted there could be many more than 37 second-level authorities.    There are also reserva-tions about the status to be given to Shetland, Orkney and theWestern Isles.The Government welcome the Commission1s fundamental approach to the problems and the broad objectives for local government whichit has stated.    They accept that major rationalisation of localgovernment in Scotland is necessary; that this must involve a/radical
radical reduction in the number of authorities with executive powers; and that the division between town and country should bebrought to an endo    We agree with the Commission that it is vital that Scottish local government should enjoy greater status and responsibility than it does now, and that it should be soreformed as to enable central Government to give local authoritiesmore freedom and power.What the final pattern should be cannot be settled withoutfurther consultation.    The Secretary of State has already invitedcomments from all interested bodies.   The process of consultationwill be thorough;, although we appreciate the importance of keeping the period of uncertainty to a minimum.    Our objective is tointroduce comprehensive legislation as soon as possible *    It is our aim to complete in the early part of next year curconsultations on the Commission&apos;s proposals for the basicstructure and division of functions.   V/e intend to announcedecisions on these basic questions before proceeding to thefurther consultations that will be necessary on the more detailed recommendations, concerning for instance the safeguarding of staffinterests and the precise definition of boundaries.Proposals for the reorganisation of local government have nowbeen made for Wales, England and Scotland.    There are differences between these proposals.   This is not unexpected because of the differences between the three countries, for example in theirhistory, geography and distrlkmtion of population? and our final decisions in each case will have full regard to the particular circumstances of the country to which they relate.For Scotland the Royal Commissions Report presents us witha unique opportunity to shape a large part of the country&apos;future.    It is an opportunity which the Government for their partwelcome and accept.
