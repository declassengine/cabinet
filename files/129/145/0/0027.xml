IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTIES GOVERNMENT)C(69) 152 COPY NO.       _17th Novembers 1969CABINETCONTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE NEW PENSIONS scheme memorandum by fche Secretary cf State for Social services in the January White Paper &quot;National Superannuation and social insurance&quot; (Crando 3883), we proposed a contribution of 6f per cent of earnings by both employers and employees.,    Employees would pay the contribution on earnings up to a ceiling of if- times average industrialearnings.    The employers&apos; contribution would be paid on all earnings withouta ceiling.    The contribution was to be made up as followsg**Employer Employeeper cent per centNational superannuation 4^ 4-fRedundancy fundx4Social insurance, industrial injuriesand health service 2 22.       We had not at that time worked out our detailed proposals for social insurance and industrial injuries.    The White Paper merely said that per cent would be enough to provide for social insurance and industrial injuries benefits on about their pi-esent scale, and for a health service contribution at about the same level in relation to earnings as at the timeof the White Paper,3.      In July we published a further White Paper on &quot;Social Insurance&quot;(Cmndo 4124) in which we gave details of the benef its, including industrial injuries benef its, to be paid out of the Social Insurance Fundc    We thenindicated that to finance those benefits, allowing for a national health service contribution of j per cent a sides the contribution cf 2 per cent allowed inthe previous White Paper might need to be increased by about 0C 2 per cent a side.    We added that the actual rate of contribution specified in thelegislation would depend on final decisions on the proposals for the new scheme as a whole and for the national health service contribution.
4c      We now need to settle fche contribution rates to be included in theBill,,    The Government Actuary&apos;% final calculations- taking account of thedecisions on contracting oufcs show that fche contribution originally proposed for national superannuation (4f per cent by employees and 4-1&quot; per cent by employers) is all right and that Ia 7 per cent a side is needed for social insurance (including industrial injuries )a    The Department of employment and Productivity have reached the conclusion that a contribution of1, 2 per cent by the employer would be enough for the redundancy fundinstead of the \ per cent originally proposed,,    So the contribution whichis needed,, apai-fc from the health service element, is 6,, 45 per cent by employees and 60 4 per cent by employe rs0National Health Service contribution5C      At toda^/fs earnings levelsa a national health service contributionabout 0o4 per cent a side (or the equivalent) would be needed to produce thesame income as the present flat-rate contribution,,    The yield of anearnings^based contribution would9 of course, rise with earnings,,    even so, I think there is much to be said for moving^ as time goes on, towardsraising more of the costs of the health service from the contributioninstead of from general ta.xation0    As a first step^ I should be in favourof including in the Bill a health service contribution yielding rather morethan the present fSafc^rafce? so long as this can be achieved f airly a60      On the other hand, I do not think it would be right or wise tc ra.isethe employee^ contribution above the 6f per cent which we proposed in theoriginal White Paper last january    This contribution already means that,as compared with the contribution rates which came into force last week,a man on average earnings of  24 a week who is not &quot;contracted out&quot; would pay 2s0 more, and a man earning  35 or more a week would pay 14sc 7dmore than at present-    So for a mail earning a bit over average earningsthe new scheme is bound to mean a fairly sharp increase in contributions,and I do not think we should make this worse070      However^ I think there are respectable grounds for expectingindustry to make a rather bigger contribution towards the cost of the health service0    Industry has a direct interest in keeping workers in goodhealth and, if the State did not provide an adequate health service? goodemployers would have to make alternative arrangements of their own,Moreover, industry adds to the burden of the health services through its effect on the health of workers,,8,      There are, too, the precedents of many advanced industrial countries where the cost of social security and health insurance fails more heavily on employers than employees^    This is true of all fche countries of the European. Economic Community,,    If our application to join theCommon Market succeeds,, it would be a step towards the European systemif more of our social security costs were bcrae by the employerc*- 2&apos;
9o      I accept that a higher health service contribution by employers would add to the costs of industry 8 and so have some effect on prices andthe balance of payments.    And there would be a good deal of complaint bythe Confederation of British Industry (CBI)S whom I should have to tell inadvance of our proposal.10.      For these reasons, I do not suggest any major shift in the divisionof costs between employer and employee.    What I propose is a health service contribution of 0o 3 per cent by the employee and a 0,6 per cent by the employer^,    We should then have a total contribution for those notcontracted out of 6f per cent by employees and 7 per cent by employers,,11.       This would give us a health service contribution yielding at 1969earnings about  198 million as against  182 million which comes from thepresent flat&quot;rate contribution.    Towards the health service contribution,employers would be paying about  130 million against  61 million by employees.    In other words, compared v/ith an even split of the health service contribution we should be shifting about  35 million from employees to employers out of a total contribution income of some $2, 700 million.And the employers&apos;&apos; proposed 7 per cent is only slightly above the.95 per cent foreshadowed for both employer and employee in the JulyWhite Paper.12.      In fact employers would be getting away more lightly under the new scheme than these figures above suggest.    Taking the contribution incomeas a whole (including the employers&apos;&quot; contribution to the redundancy funcl)^employers would be meeting about 52-1 per cent of the joint employer/employee costs.    This compares with 70 per cent or more in some of theCommon Market countries.    Indeed, even under our present flat-ratescheme, the employer is already meeting about 53 per cent of the jointemployer/employee contributions,,    The reason why the ney/ scheme wouldnot increase the employer^ share of the total contributions, even taking into account my proposal for the national health service contribution,, isthat about  100 million of the extra income we shall be raising under thenew scheme will come from married women who will no longer have the choice not to contribute?  employers already pay their share of the contribution for these women.13,,      If my proposals in paragx-aph 9 for employers and employees are accepted the contribution for the self-employed would be 30s. lOd a week,compared v/ith the present contribution ion f or a man of 24sa10dtt    The basiccontribution (payable voluntarily by those who have no earnings, or whoseearnings are insufficient to make them liable for compulsory contributions)would be 18s. a week, compared v/ith the present non-employed contribution for a man of 19s0 9d.,
Conclusion14o      I therefore recommend that(a) The national Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill should provide&apos;for a contribution of 6f per cent, up to the earningsceilings by employees, including 0, 3 per cent towards the health service.(b) Employers should pay 7 per cent of all earnings., includingC 6 per cent towards the health service,(c) The self-employed and basic contributions should be as set outin paragraph 13 above,The short term15.      I have been discussing with the Chancellor of the Exchequer how best to limit the burden of the national health service on general taxationin 1970&quot;71 and later years without imposing the levy on motorists whichwas accepted by the Cabinet (CC(59) 38th Conclusions^ but the political objections to which have become increasingly apparent,,    I have recentlysuggested to him that an increase in the employer^ national health service contribution next year would be a good solution,,    I should need to give the cbi some forev/arning of this when I see them3 near the end of the month,about my proposals for the new BILL (see paragraph 9),16,      An increase of 6d in the employer*s health service contribution would yield just over  25 million in a full years and Is would yield just over  50 million (compared with the expected S.l0j million a year from theroad accident levy)0    Allowing for the expected rise in earnings over thenext year or two, an increase within this range could be imposed -without our. having to change the provision I have proposed for the main Bill(paragraph 14) in order to prevent a fall in income when the new schemestarts.    As the health service contribution is at present predominantlypaid by the employee, such a move would be a further step towards the contribution structure of the new scheme.RoHoS,, C3Department of Health and Social Security a S^E,1^17fch November, 1969
