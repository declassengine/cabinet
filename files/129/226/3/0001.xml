to meet future demand.    Consumers have seen

2.    The upshot is that total domestic demand has risen faster than the

economy&apos;s capacity to supply, lead^g to a re-emergence of inflationary

pressure, manifesting itself botJ^ kectly in a pick-up in the underlying

increase in the Retail Price   &lt;  (  ),  and indirectly in a sharp growth

in imports and hence a widening e ;afreet ,account deficit.

ECONOMIC PROSPECTS



,5.    As in the United Kingdom, growth in the rest of the world in 1988 was

re buoyant than forecast a year ago, exceeding expectations in each of

major industrial countries,  in most cases substantially so. World

e in manufactures probably grew by 10 per cent.    Even those European

ea0M)ies that have been sluggish in recent years are now experiencing

raster growth.    Partly as a result, consumer price inflation edged up a

little in a number of countries and most commodity prices have risen.



6.    The latest indicators suggest that activity in the major economies

remains stu^,  though increases in short term interest rates to counter

rising         may lead to some slow down through 1989.    Gro s National

Product g^inA^y fall from 4 per cent in 1988 to a still healthy 3 per

cent this year.    World trade growth should still be high.

house purchase rising much less rapidly than in the middle of last year,

and showing signs of falling in some areas.    The growth of retail sales in

eneral has moderated, and sales of some consumer durables have fallen,

dicators of consumer confidence suggest that expenditure growth in the

r ahead will be modest.    The personal sector savings ratio should as a

t begin to recover.



. Meanwhile, company sector saving remains high and the signs are that

the very strong investment performance of the last two years will continue

in 1989, though growth will probably be at a less heady pace.    The rate of

return on capital is at its highest level for over twenty years, and the

extra inves^^nt that this is generating will help to underpin the supply

side imprAtKets of recent years,

13. The underlying rate of inflation - whether measured by the RPI less

mortgage interest payments or by producer prices - is lower, but still

much too high.    We will have to m^atain the present very tight monetary

policy long enough to ensure thaA^eis put firmly on a steady downward

The continued strong growth of investment could keep imports of capital

goods high for the time being, and it may take a little while for the

adverse effects on trade performance of very high capacity utilisation in

some industries to unwind.    Even though the deficit could well fall during

the coming year,  the outturn for 1989 as a whole might J&gt;^^1ch the same as

that for 1988.



15. To summarise, following a prolonged period of above a

likelihood is that growth will be well below trend over th 

GDP in 1989 could still be 2$ per cent higher than in 1988,

FISCAL PROSPECTS



16.  In last year&apos;s Budget I announced major tax reforms,  including cuts in

oth the basic and higher rates of income tax.    Yet despite this



udgeted for a PSDR in 1988-89 of some  3 billion, or 3/^ Qf a per cent

,_P.    In the event, the public finances have turned out considerably

&gt;trAeer.    The forecast I gave in the Autumn Statement was for a PSDR of

 ^ ^1   , or 2 per cent of GDP.    Later information suggests that the

surplus will comfortably exceed even this.



as

country enjoys a comparable surplus - owes much to the buoyancy of the

Taxation, Expenditure and Borrowing



Since the Government first took office, total taxes and NICs have

risen by 4 percentage points of GDP, though the ratio has fallen

from its peak in 1981-82. This has enabled us to make net

repayments of government debt in the last two years.

distortion of the figures from the abolition of child tax

3. These figures reflect the rise in the standard employees&apos; NIC

rate from 6h per cent to 9 per cent. The lower rates introduced

in the 1985 Finance Act do not affect the cases shown. So far as

income tax is concerned, personal allowances have increased by

about 25 per cent in real terms since 1978-79, slightly less than

earnings.    The basic rate has been reduced from 33p to 25p.



4. Average earnings have of course increased by substantially

more than prices since 1978-79. So a married man on average

earnings has seen his real take-home pay rise by  45 per week.

The increase for a married man on half average earnings has been

 22 per week, and on twice average earnings  94 per week.

5. As the table shows, indexation of allowances in the Budget,

with no reduction in the basic rate, would lead to a very slight

rise in the proportion of incomes taken in tax and NICs. This is

because earnings are assumed to rise by more than the increase in

tax thresholds, which is indexed to changes in prices.



Business Taxation



6. Following the sharp rise in corporation tax receipts over the

past three years, as a result of the substantial recovery in

company profits, total taxes paid by businesses (outside the North

Sea) are now higher as a percentage of GDP than in 1978-79.

Within this total, the major change has been a fall in employers&apos;

NICs (and NIS) as a &quot;percentage of GDP, offset by increases in

corporation tax, business rates and &apos;other&apos; taxes as the following

table shows:
