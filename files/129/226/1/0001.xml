I have tried in my proposed mainXjt&apos;een Paper (The Work and

practices of the profession from first V^p^iples.    The Paper states that

our overall objective is to see that tha^iublic has the best possible

access to legal services and that those services are of the right quality

for the particular needs of the client.    It sets competition and the

maintenance of standards as its twin approaches to achieving this

objective.    It therefore promotes the removal o/^i^etrictions on

competition, where these serve no useful purpose, wrfile seeking to ensure

that there are safeguards, which are suf f icient ???^  ??? more, to maintain

the standards of conduct and the integrity of the\iej$aA^profession. The

Paper then seeks to draw out the structure which is ^jf/^uited to give

CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION



1.1 A contingency fee arrangement is one whereby a lawyer

agrees that he will accept his client&apos;s case on the

basis that he receives no payment if the case is lost,

but that if it is won, he will be paid some percentage

or share of the award made by the court. Such

agreements are unenforceable in England and Wales and

solicitors and barristers are prohibited by their

respective professional codes of conduct from entering

into them. In Scotland, solicitors may agree to

conduct litigation on a &apos;speculative&apos; basis, that is,

they will receive their normal taxed costs if the case

is won, but nothing if it is lost. Contingency fees

are, however, allowed in many of the jurisdictions of

the United States of America, where the payment made to

the lawyer often relates to the amount of damages

recovered by the client.



1.2 The use of contingency fees in England and Wales has

always previously been resisted. The main arguments

against their use are that:-



(a) they may result in a conflict of interest between

lawyer and client. The lawyer will have a direct

financial interest in the outcome of the case and

will be unable to give the client impartial

advice.    This may lead to:-



(i) the  lawyer being tempted to encourage



the client to settle early to avoid the

effort involved in fighting the case;



1


CONFIDENTIAL



(ii) the lawyer concentrating on cases with a



high nuisance value where the defendant

is more likely to be forced into making

an offer to settle; and



(iii) the   lawyer   being   tempted   to   try to



enhance his client&apos;s chances of success,

perhaps by coaching witnesses or

withholding inconvenient evidence; and



(b)   experience  in  the  USA  suggests  that contingency

fees:-



(i) encourage juries to award excessively

high damages; and



(ii) encourage litigants to proceed with

cases with very little merit, leading

to an explosion of litigation.



1.3 Proponents of the introduction of contingency fees

discount these arguments. They point out that the

dangers of a conflict of interest may be guarded

against by proper codes of conduct and through

restrictions on the amount a lawyer is able to recover.

They also note that what are considered to be the

undesirable elements of the US system go wider than

contingency fees and have their roots in some

fundamental differences between the jurisdictions in

the US and that in England and Wales. These differences

are explored more fully in paras 3.5 to 3.10 below.



1.4 Current Government policy is, moreover, in favour of

deregulation. This entails the removal of restrictions

and the consequent widening of choice for those

providing a service and for the consumer, unless there



2


CONFIDENTIAL



are clear public interest reasons to the contrary. The

Government also believes that the onus should be on

those who want to maintain a restriction to justify

it.



1.5 The arguments in favour of the introduction of

contingency fees are that:-



(a) they would give individuals and organisations who

do not qualify for legal aid, but who cannot

support expensive litigation, the opportunity of

bringing their claims to court;



(b) they would encourage a greater level of

commitment on the part of the lawyer; and



(c) they would encourage competition between lawyers,

as clients would be able to shop around between

solicitors to seek the most advantageous

agreement.



1.6 The Royal Commission on Legal Services1 (Benson)

considered whether contingency fees should be allowed

in England and Wales, but concluded that any change in

the law which gave lawyers a direct financial interest

in the outcome of a case was not in the public interest

on the grounds that it would endanger the independence

of the legal profession. The Royal Commission believed

that the system would not work well here and would give

rise to serious dissatisfaction. It would benefit only

a limited class of litigants and would reward some

lawyers disproportionately. The Royal Commission on

Legal  Services  in Scotland2   (Hughes)  also concluded



11979 Cmnd 7648

*1980 Cmnd 7846



3


CONFIDENTIAL



that contingency fees should not be Introduced in

Scotland. They were particularly concerned about the

risk that a conflict of interest might arise between a

solicitor and his client where there was an agreement

to act on a contingency basis.



1.7 More recently, however, both the Civil Justice Review3

and the Marre Report4 have recommended that the

possibility of allowing contingency fee arrangements

between lawyers and their clients should be re-

examined. In suggesting that the prohibition on

contingency fees should be open to re-examination the

Civil Justice Review pointed out that there have been

major advances in regulation policy, and that it could

be argued that the risks arising out of a contingency

fee system could be controlled by specific regulations

rather than a general ban.



1.8 It is against this background that the Government has

concluded that further consideration should be given to

the question whether existing bars to the use of

contingency fees should be lifted. This paper

explores the issues and examines possible mechanisms

for the control of contingency fees and the scope for

change.



1.9 The Government would welcome comments on the issues

raised in this paper by 2 May 1989. Submissions should

be addressed to:

CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND



The position in England and Wales



2.1 Contingency   fee   arrangements   have   always been

unenforceable at common law in England and Wales.



2.2 Maintenance (the giving of assistance, encouragement or

support to litigation by a person who has no legitimate

interest in the litigation nor any motive recognised by

the court as justifying the interference) and champerty

(the maintenance of an action in consideration of a

promise to give the maintainer a share in the proceeds

or subject matter of the action) were long prohibited

at common law. It was considered to be against public

policy that litigation should be promoted and supported

by those with no interest in it. Blackstone&apos;s

Commentaries record that &quot;This is an offence against

public justice, as it keeps alive strife and

contention, and perverts the remedial process of law

into an engine of oppression.&quot;1



2.3 The Criminal Law Act 1967 abolished the old common law

offences of maintenance and champerty. Section 14(2) of

the same Act provides, however, that abolition of the

common law offences shall not affect any rule as to the

cases in which a contract is to be treated as contrary

to public policy or otherwise illegal. Agreements to

maintain an action therefore remain unenforceable

today.

(1897) S.12

CONFIDENTIAL



Agreements to act on a contingency basis are also

restricted by section 59 of the Solicitors Act 1974.

They are proscribed completely in respect of

proceedings in England and Wales by rule 8 of the

Solicitors Practice Rules 1988. This provides that:-



&quot;(1) A solicitor who is retained or employed to

prosecute any action, suit or other contentious

proceeding shall not enter into any arrangement

to receive a contingency fee in respect of that

proceeding.



(2) Paragraph (1) of this Rule shall not apply to an

arrangement in respect of an action, suit or

other contentious proceeding in any country other

than England or Wales when such arrangement is

made between a solicitor and a person entitled to

practice as a lawyer in that other country in

respect of that proceeding.&quot;



The position in Scotland



2.5 In Scotland there  is a long tradition of  the lawyer



acting on a speculative basis. The speculative action

is usually an action for damages for personal injury.

Solicitor and advocate undertake to act for the pursuer

on the basis that they will not be remunerated except

in the event of success and that any costs such as

court fees will be defrayed by the solicitor. The

courts in Scotland have long recognised that this is a

perfectly legitimate basis on which to carry on

litigation and that it is a reasonable way of enabling

people who do not qualify for legal aid to finance

costly litigation: X Insurance Co   A and   1936 SC.

239. Undertaking to act on a speculative basis imposes

on   both  advocate   and   solicitor   special   duties to



1



f 2.4



2


CONFIDENTIAL



satisfy themselves that there 18 a reasonable prospect

of success. If a solicitor wishes to instruct an

advocate on a speculative basis he must state the fact

explicitly in his instructions and the advocate is not

bound to accept.



2.6 In the event of the case being successful the solicitor

and advocate are paid their normal fee. If the case is

lost they are paid nothing. Traditionally the

speculative action is useful to pursuers who have a

reasonable case, but who are not eligible for legal aid

on financial grounds, such as small businesses. At a

time when the arguments in favour of contingency fees

as such were firmly rejected, the Royal Commission on

Legal Services in Scotland recognized that the

speculative action played an important role in Scottish

law. The view was, however, taken that small

businesses ought properly to obtain insurance to cover

their needs as potential litigants.



2.7 An important feature of this system is that it offers

no protection to the pursuer against the award of

expenses in the event of an unsuccessful outcome. The

rule that costs follow the event is thus not affected

by a scheme such as the speculative action. The

unsuccessful pursuer remains liable for the costs of

his successful opponent.



The position in the United States of America



2.8 When the subject of contingency fees proper is

discussed the first point of reference is invariably

the USA, where the Supreme Court has recognised the

validity of contingency fee contracts since 1850. There

is, however, a variety of schemes operating within the

50 states.  Each state has its own individual practice



3


CONFIDENTIAL



and its own controls on contingency fee agreements

between lawyers and clients. The State of Maine, for

example, prohibits contingency fees entirely. In New

York, Michigan and Delaware, statute has overruled

initial restrictions. Contingency fees are not

prohibited in New Jersey, Alabama, Ohio and

California, but they are subject to limitations and

controls.



2.9 Contingency fees are most frequently used in personal

injury cases where the potential award (or reward) is

greatest. Some lawyers may also agree to act on a

contingency basis in outstanding debt, workmen&apos;s

compensation, corporate business practice, taxation,

land compensation and will contests.



2.10 Despite a longstanding and general acceptance of the

contingency basis for remuneration, the U.S. courts

have proscribed the use of the contingency fee in

certain areas on the grounds of public policy. The

Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional

Responsibility (CPR) allow contingency fee agreements

only in civil cases, prohibiting their use in criminal

matters. The Ethical Considerations of the CPR also

advise that contingency fees are not appropriate in

domestic cases.



2.11 Across the states various methods are used to fix the

fee recoverable by the lawyer. For example, the lawyer

may be able to assess his fee using a formula which

takes account of the size of the award recovered. In

other jurisdictions the &quot;customary rate&quot; may be applied

or the rate may be fixed by the Bar Association, by the

court (particularly in the case of litigants under a

disability), by statute prescribing the maximum fee

that can be recovered or by an administrative agency.



4


CONFIDENTIAL



2.12 The most common basis of charging for contingency fees

in the USA is, however, a percentage of the sum

recovered. The actual figure can be calculated in a

number of ways. There may be one rate applicable to

the whole recovery; decreasing percentage rates as the

amount of the recovery increases; increasing percentage

rates as the amount of the recovery increases,

dependent on the expenditure of additional skill and

effort; or a series of increasing percentage rates

applied to the recovery depending on the stage reached

in the proceedings before the recovery. The agreement

will also stipulate whether the costs and expenses of

the action are to be deducted from the recovery before

or after the lawyer&apos;s percentage is computed.



2.13 No jurisdiction other than those in the United States

operates an extensive contingency fee system.

CHAPTER 3 - ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST

THE INTRODUCTION OF CONTINGENCY FEES



The risk of a conflict of interest



-.- II.



3.1



3.2



The principles underlying the prohibition in England

and Wales of the use of contingency fees relate, as has

been noted above, to the undesirability of anyone being

allowed in any way to encourage or support litigation

in which he does not have an interest. In particular

the belief is that it is unprofessional for a lawyer to

be paid on a contingency basis. The main concern is

that to act on a contingency basis would, for the

lawyer, produce an unacceptable conflict between his

interests and those of his client and encourage him to

behave in an unprofessional manner.



The conflict is said to arise from the fact that a

lawyer acting on a contingency basis has a direct

interest in the outcome of the litigation and that this

will prevent him from being an impartial adviser. He

will be open to the temptation of encouraging his

client to accept an early (and perhaps unnecessarily

low) settlement in order to avoid the high expense (for

the lawyer) of a trial. He may concentrate on cases

which have little merit but a high nuisance value,

which will cause the opponent to settle even if his

chances of success in any trial would be good. The

lawyer&apos;s direct interest in the outcome might lead him

to indulge in undesirable practices designed to enhance

his client&apos;s chances, such as coaching witnesses,

withholding inconvenient evidence or failing to cite

legal authorities which damage his client&apos;s case.



Protection by professional codes of conduct



1


CONFIDENTIAL



3.3 It is not clear that there is any real basis to these

fears. Clients probably already expect their lawyers

to be fully committed to the case and, since this is

what every client 18 likely to want, to winning that

case. Wanting success cannot be wrong in itself,

provided that unfair means are not used in achieving

it. Any tendency on the part of a lawyer to &quot;improve&quot;

his client&apos;s case ought to be capable of control

through professional codes of conduct, and the judges

already possess the power to penalise solicitors

personally in costs for any improper act or omission in

the conduct of litigation1 . Both sides of the

profession are, in England and Wales, subject to

stringent codes of practice which, if broken, may lay

the lawyer open to disciplinary proceedings before his

professional body which can result in his losing his

right to practise. To assume that the financial

interest introduced by a contingency fee will override

the standards of an individual in relation to his

client is to assume an unreasonably low standard of

conduct for the profession as a whole. There is no

evidence to justify this assumption.



3.4 It must also be remembered that the value of the

subject matter of the lawyer&apos;s work can already be

relevant to the fees charged. Appendix 2 to Order 62

of the Rules of the Supreme Court sets out the factors

which have to be taken into account in the exercise of

a taxing officer&apos;s discretion to fix costs. These

factors include, amongst others, &quot;the importance of the

cause or matter to the client&quot; and &quot;where money or

property is involved, its amount or value&quot;. The same

principles apply in respect of both contentious and

non-contentious matters.

The United States experience



3.5 Critics of contingency fees point to the U.S.

experience as further justification for continuing the

ban on their use in England and Wales. It is said that

the existence of contingency fees encourages juries in

civil cases to award excessively high damages to

successful plaintiffs, because it is known that the

balance otherwise left available after the lawyer has

taken his percentage (which may be as high as 50%) may

be insufficient to compensate the plaintiff for his

injuries.



3.6 It is also said that the ability to sue on a contingent

basis encourages the pursuit of low merit cases for

nuisance value against organisations with sizeable

assets, such as large companies and Government

departments. The combination of high legal fees - which

cannot, as in England and Wales, be recovered in

costs - and the fear of punitive damages is said to

encourage companies in particular to settle out of

court, whatever the merits of the case, to save time

and money. This causes an increase in the insurance

premiums which have to be paid by large organisations

which are ultimately passed on to the consumer.

Finally, it is said that the existence of contingency

fees encourages the distasteful practice of &quot;bounty-

hunting&quot; lawyers chasing those affected by a major

disaster.



Levels of damages



3.7 It is not clear to what extent the existence of the

jury in U.S. civil actions leads to excessive awards of

damages.     It  is  at  least  likely,   as  critics  of the



3


CONFIDENTIAL



U.S. system suggest, that knowledge of the existence of

a contingency fee agreement and of the high percentages

required by lawyers, will induce civil juries to make

excessive awards of damages. The judge 18, however,

able to reduce the damages initially awarded by the

jury and it may be that exceptionally high awards

result where a judge fails to give adequate directions

to the jury or where there 18 a desire to make an

example of a defendant in circumstances giving rise to

public concern.



3.8 Contingency fees (if introduced into England and Wales)



would need to operate within the current system of

awarding damages. Here, damages are almost always

awarded by the judge, and only in certain limited

categories of actions (such as defamation), by a jury.

The present method of awarding damages is a staged

process involving the determination of general damages

for the type of injury suffered and special damages

for expenditure and loss to the date of the hearing,

plus expected loss of income and future expenses. As

the sum of damages to be paid remains within the power

of the judge according to well-established guidelines,

the introduction of contingency fees would appear to

have little bearing on the sums awarded. Just as there

is no evidence that the application of the statutory

charge to damages and property recovered by a legally

aided litigant results in increased awards of damages,

8  it seems unlikely that current practices in the

awards of damages would change in the event of the

introduction of contingency fees. Even if it were

thought that there was a risk that judges in England

and Wales would react in the way in which it is said

that U.S. juries react, this could be avoided by

Introducing a rule that the fact that the case was

being   run  on  a  contingency  basis   should  not be



4


CONFIDENTIAL



revealed until after judgment had been given. The

approach could be similar to that taken on payment into

court, the existence of which is not revealed to the

judge until the case has concluded and he is

considering the award of costs.



The rule that &quot;costs follow the event&quot;



3.9 There is a further significant difference between the



position in the United States of America and that in

England and Wales.    Here,  the losing party is usually

required to pay the reasonable costs of his successful

opponent.      There   is   no   such   rule   in   the U.S.

jurisdictions  which  allow contingency  fees.     At the

moment in England and Wales,  the risk of having to pay

costs   if   unsuccessful   could   be   said   to   act   as a

deterrent  on  the  plaintiff.      He  has  to  weigh very

carefully  the  chances  of   loss  before  embarking on

litigation.    If he is able to avoid the risk of paying

his own costs under a contingency fee agreement, he

may  be  more  willing  than  at  present  to  embark on

litigation,   even   if   he  cannot   avoid   a potential

liability to his successful opponent.    Since his lawyer

is,  however,  likely to have conducted a very rigorous

assessment of the prospects of success before taking a

case on a contingency basis,   it is unlikely that the

introduction of contingency fees,   taken together with

the rule that costs follow the event,  would have any

real impact on the propensity to litigate. Certainly

it is thought that the existence in England and Wales

of the rule that costs follow the event would continue

to have a deterrent effect,  even if contingency fees

were  to be  allowed.     Any change  in this  rule would

certainly leave defendants unprotected,  and this would

not be desirable,  given that it is hard to see how a



5


CONFIDENTIAL



defendant to an action for damages could benefit from

the introduction of contingency fees.



Other factors in the US system



3.10 There are several other differences between the US

jurisdictions and that in England and Wales which need

to be taken into account. United States society is

litigious on a scale not known in England and Wales. In

the USA, treble damages may be awarded in anti-trust

cases and, in other cases, punitive damages are very

much more widely used than they are in England and

Wales. There is, therefore, a much greater incentive in

the USA for plaintiffs to pursue marginal cases.

Finally, class actions may be brought in the USA and

this, combined with the other factors already

mentioned, encourages &quot;bounty-hunting&quot; by US lawyers.



Volume of litigation



3.11 It is in any event unclear that the mere existence of

contingency fees would lead to an upsurge in

litigation. Quite apart from any restraining effect

that the costs rules might have, it is unrealistic to

suppose that lawyers, as professional people running

businesses, would willingly take on cases where there

was very little real prospect of success. The

solicitor invited to act on a contingency basis will

have to make a rigorous assessment of the likely

chances of success and the possible amount of damages

recoverable. Cases which will be difficult to prove,

perhaps involving the collection of highly complex

evidence, will not be taken on unless the likely

rewards are high enough to reward the work that will

have to be undertaken. This assessment will have to be

undertaken   in  more  detail   than  where  the  work is



6


CONFIDENTIAL



undertaken on a time charge basis. So although a larger

section of the community would have access to a means

of funding their litigation, in practice solicitors

will sift out the less viable cases as they do at

present. The contingency fee would, however, give some

people the opportunity of seeking legal advice and

would give others the choice of how they pay for the

services of a solicitor.



Access to justice



3.12 The main advantage of contingency fees is that they

might give &quot;small&quot; plaintiffs the opportunity of

bringing their claims to court. &quot;Small&quot; in this

context means those individuals and organizations who

do not receive legal aid but who nevertheless have

insufficient means to support the full cost of

expensive litigation and who cannot call on, for

example, the support of a trade union or do not have

legal expenses insurance. Where there is a desire or

need to litigate there is also a demand for the means

to do so. Although legal aid is widely available in

this country for those whose means fall below

prescribed limits, it is not available to those above

those limits or in respect of certain proceedings (such

as proceedings before roost tribunals). There may be

sections of the population whose means take them above

the legal aid eligibility limits who might wish to

litigate on a contingency basis.



Allowing the consumer to choose



3.13 Contingency fee arrangements may also be said to

encourage a greater level of commitment on the part of

the lawyer, who would have a stake in the outcome of

the   proceedings   (if   it   can  be   accepted   that the



7


CONFIDENTIAL



existence of this stake does not produce an

unacceptable conflict of interest between the lawyer

and his client, nor place the lawyer&apos;s duty to the

court in jeopardy). If contingency fees were

introduced this would be a further incentive for the

client to shop around available firms of solicitors,

since the likely cost to him would be influenced by the

choice between contingency or conventional fee

arrangements, as well as by the price structure of

different firms. This will place pressure on the

solicitor to operate efficiently, especially where the

contingency basis is concerned, because the more

drawn-out the proceedings, the lower the likely reward

for the solicitor and the later he will get it.



3.14 Contingency fee arrangements would also spread the risk

of litigation for &quot;small&quot; litigants who can be expected

rarely to resort to the courts for the resolution of

their disputes. The U.S. system of contingency fees

shifts the risks of litigation from the plaintiff to

the lawyer. The lawyer is able to spread those risks

over a number of cases and is therefore in a better

position to bear them.



3.15 Removing the ban on contingency fees would enable the

client who has a cause of action to seek out the most

advantageous agreement; and allowing this freedom of

choice may alone be regarded as grounds for lifting the

ban on contingency fees.



Product liability



3.16 There   is   a   significant  argument   in  favour  of the



introduction of contingency fees to be drawn from the

US experience. It is one of a number of possible

measures  which may  confidently  be  expected,   on the



8


CONFIDENTIAL



basis of experience in the United States, to shift the

present balance of advantage between the litigants in

product liability cases. Such a shift would make

producers more conscious of their duty to supply safe

products, and induce them to give product safety higher

priority in the conduct of their business. This in turn

would tend to reduce the number and severity of

injuries suffered by people as a result of defective

and unsafe products. In the United States industry&apos;s

increasing concern with product safety, which now makes

European producers appear by comparison to be backward,

has been fuelled by fear of adverse court judgements

and awards of damages, rather than by respect for the

criminal law which prescribes certain safety

requirements for certain goods (such as electrical

equipment) or by any altruistic wish that the risk of

injuries to consumers should be kept to a minimum.



Summary



3.17 It appears that existing restrictions on the use of

contingency fees developed because of the need to

prevent interference in the conduct of proceedings in

court and the encouragement of cases which would not

otherwise have been brought. The adoption of express

restrictions into professional codes of practice

reflects the distaste with which lawyers, as members of

a professional group, viewed the use of such devices as

contingency fees.



3.18 Rules which were developed to prevent interference with

the administration of justice in feudal times may no

longer be appropriate to the demands of the public for

the delivery of efficient and business-like legal

services. There is a class of litigants who may drop

claims because they are ineligible for legal aid but do



9


CONFIDENTIAL



not believe they have sufficient means to pursue their

claims unaided, even though they are reasonably

confident of securing damages. There are, however,

worries about the conflict between the interests of the

client and those of the solicitor which, to the extent

that they do not coincide in a contingency fee

agreement, may put the client in a weaker and less

advantageous position.



3.19 Solicitors and barristers have had to respond to market

pressures in other areas, such as advertising. The ban

on the use of contingency fees could be completely

lifted and all restrictions removed. It could be argued

that the client does not need any protection when

entering into an agreement with a solicitor and that he

is perfectly capable of shopping around to seek the

most advantageous terms. The solicitor does, however,

have greater knowledge of the likely costs in a

particular set of circumstances. He will, therefore,

be in a stronger position than the client in the

negotiations leading up to a contingency fee agreement.

If the parties to the agreement are in unequal

positions when the bargain is being struck then some

means may be required of restricting the terms of

agreement that the solicitor might otherwise be able to

impose on the client.



3.20 The lessons to be drawn from the U.S. experience are

that the unrestricted use of contingency fees appears

to be undesirable. The differences between the

jurisdictions are, however, such that the worst

excesses of U.S. contingency fee arrangements should

not develop in England and Wales. It is the

combination of such factors as a jury&apos;s ability to

award damages, the absence of any rule that the loser

pays  the winner&apos;s costs,   the possibility of punitive



10


CONFIDENTIAL



damages and the use of class actions, none of which is

present in England and Wales, which, taken together

with the ability to use contingency fees, gives rise to

the worries about the U.S. system. It 18 worth bearing

in mind, moreover, that the tide of opinion in the

United States of America is turning against the

unrestricted use of contingency fee agreements. Some

states are now reviewing their policies in this area

and considering tighter controls on the way contingency

fees are operated.

CHAPTER 4 - HOW A SYSTEM OF CONTINGENCY FEES MIGHT OPERATE



A speculative basis



4.1 The first, and perhaps most obvious, relaxation of the

existing restrictions in England and Wales would be to

allow solicitors and counsel to act on a speculative

basis, as is already possible in Scotland. A solicitor

would be free to agree with his client that he would

be paid only if the proceedings were successful. If

they were, he would, however, recover only his taxed

costs and would not be entitled to any share in the

damages or property recovered in the litigation. If it

were necessary to instruct counsel, this would again

be on a speculative basis, with counsel&apos;s clerk being

informed of the basis before the brief was accepted.

Counsel would be free to turn it down if he were not

prepared to act on a speculative basis. It would not,

however, be necessary to obtain a full taxation in

every case funded on a speculative basis. Taxation

would be required only where, as is the case now, there

is a dispute between solicitor and client as to the

amount that the solicitor can reasonably charge in his

bill.



4.2 There does not appear to be any substantial argument

against the introduction of speculative actions in

England and Wales.



4.3 The second relaxation would be to build on the

introduction of the speculative action. The obvious

shortcoming of such actions, so far as solicitors and

counsel are concerned, is that there is no extra

element to compensate them for the cases which they

undertake on a speculative basis but which are

unsuccessful. They will not, therefore, wish to carry

too great a risk and will be concerned to be as sure as



1


CONFIDENTIAL



they can that they accept speculative actions only

where the prospects of success are excellent. The fact

that lawyers are likely to be particularly cautious in

their judgment of prospective speculative actions means

that the class of cases which is capable of being

funded in this way is likely to be very small.

Information received from the Faculty of Advocates

indicates that approximately 1% of the Faculty&apos;s

caseload is conducted on a speculative basis, the

actions undertaken being mainly reparation cases in the

Court of Session.



4.4 This difficulty could be overcome by adding an element

to the taxed costs to reflect the speculative nature

of the agreement and to reward the solicitor and

counsel for the risk that they undertake in entering

into the agreement. This might also encourage

solicitors to be more willing to consider acting on a

speculative basis than they would be if all they could

recover was their taxed costs.



4.5 The percentage to be added to the taxed costs in the

event of success could be subject only to the agreement

of the solicitor and his client (which would transform

the speculative action into something similar to the

unrestricted  contingency  fee  agreement  known  in the

USA, which is unlikely to be in the public interest) or

it   could   be   a   fixed   percentage   prescribed in

legislation or in a professional code of conduct. It

might be appropriate to fix the percentage by reference

to the amount of taxed costs recoverable,  perhaps by

way of a small uplift, rather than by reference to the

amount of damages or property recovered.     This would

mean that the lawyer would not have a direct financial

interest in the level of damages recovered. The ,taxed

costs&apos; would not, in these circumstances, be the amount



2


CONFIDENTIAL



recoverable from the defendant, but the amount that the

lawyer can reasonably expect to recover from his

client. This approach might therefore also minimise

the risk of the additional ,speculative&apos; element being

passed on to the unsuccessful defendant. Any tendency

on the part of the lawyer to inflate his taxed costs,

and thus his percentage uplift, could be controlled

through the normal process of taxation.



A restricted contingency basis



4.6 The next relaxation, which could be in addition to the



introduction of speculative actions, would be to allow

lawyers and litigants to agree contingency fees, but on

a restricted basis. The idea here would be that a

lawyer could agree to be remunerated on a &apos;no win no

fee&apos; basis, recovering in the event of success some

proportion of the amount of damages or property

recovered. The fee could be based on a percentage of

the damages recovered, and that percentage would be

dependent on the stage the proceedings had reached when

the case was concluded; for example, where the case is

settled: prior to proceedings being issued, 25%; after

proceedings have commenced but before trial, 33 1/3%;

during or after trial, 40%; on appeal, 50%. Another

method based on percentages would be to fix the

percentage fee in relation to the scale of the damages

recovered: the larger the sum recovered, the smaller

the percentage charged. Different methods of fixing

the fee might be appropriate to different types of

action. Allowing a percentage dependent on the stage

reached might, for example, be appropriate to a

personal injury case, whereas a scale relating to the

amount recovered might be more suitable in outstanding

debt cases.



3


CONFIDENTIAL



4.7 Restrictions on the amounts recoverable and on the

stage at which they could be recovered could be

contained in primary or secondary legislation promoted

by the Government or alternatively in codes of conduct

produced by appropriate professional bodies. (Even if

contained in primary or secondary legislation, the

restrictions might need to be reinforced by specific

provisions in codes of conduct).



4.8 Even though legislation or a code could be used as the

primary means of introducing restrictions on the terms

which  a   lawyer  might  otherwise  wish  to   insert   in a

contingency fee agreement,   it might also be necessary

to  allow   the   client   (and  even  possibly  the lawyer)

access to taxation in cases where it was said that the

level  of  the  fee  was  not  a   fair  reflection  of the

amount of work undertaken on the client&apos;s behalf. The

provisions of the Solicitors Act 1974 relating to the

control   of   contentious   business   agreements could

provide a suitable model for this.    The High Court has

jurisdiction under section 61 of the 1974 Act to set

aside a contentious business agreement if it is of the

opinion that  the  agreement  is  in  any  respect unfair

and unreasonable.   Where such an agreement is set aside

the costs covered by it are taxed as if it had never

been made.     Powers similar to this could,  if it were

thought to be in the public interest,  provide a long-

stop   against   the   risk   that   the particular

circumstances of an individual case might render even

the  restricted  rate  of  contingency  fee unacceptably

large,   especially  where  it   is  considered  that the

lawyer   has   not   in   the   event   made   a significant

contribution to the success of the action.



An unrestricted contingency basis



4


CONFIDENTIAL



1.9 The ultimate relaxation would be to remove all existing

restrictions on the use of contingency fees and put

nothing in their place. It 18 considered that this

would not be in the public interest. The litigant is

in a weaker position than the lawyer in negotiating the

terms of a contingency fee agreement since he does not

have the letter&apos;s expert knowledge of the likely costs

of legal proceedings. It would be inappropriate,

therefore, to allow the lawyer to require payment of

unreasonably high fees, when the litigant&apos;s desire to

get his case on and his ignorance of costs matters may

together mean that he is unable to reach a balanced

view of the likely advantages and disadvantages of

litigating on a contingency basis.



Legal aid



4.10 The arguments in favour of some relaxation of the

existing restrictions on the use of contingency fees

are often put forward as a consequence of concern about

the position of those would-be litigants whose means

take them out of the scope of the legal aid scheme, but

who are nevertheless unable to fund the costs of

litigation. It is for consideration whether the ability

to use contingency fees, if these are permitted, is to

be available regardless of whether the litigant would

also qualify for legal aid.



4.11 Lawyers who act under legal aid certificates are paid

out of the legal aid fund on what is known as the

&apos;standard basis&apos;. A lawyer being paid directly by a

private client will however, claim his fees on the

higher &apos;indemnity basis&apos;. There are, it is said, some

lawyers who are unwilling to act on a legal aid basis.

It is possible that these lawyers would, however, be

prepared to act on a contingency basis.   A litigant who



5


CONFIDENTIAL



might otherwise qualify for legal aid might, therefore,

prefer to instruct the lawyer of his choice to act on a

contingency basis.



4.12 There are,  however,   advantages enjoyed by the legally



aided litigant which he would lose if he chose to

instruct his lawyer on a contingency fee basis. It is

true that the legally aided litigant, if successful,

has to meet out of the damages awarded to him the sums

paid out of the legal aid fund on his behalf, but

although there is perhaps an analogy here with the

contingency fee arrangement, it must be remembered

that the legally aided lawyer will be paid by the fund

on the standard basis, which might amount to a smaller

sum than would be payable under a contingency fee

agreement. The legally assisted litigant also receives

a certain protection against having to pay his

opponent&apos;s costs in the event of the latter ?s success.

A contingency fee agreement would be more favourable

only if the lawyer had also agreed to pay the

opponent&apos;s costs in the event of failure. There is,

therefore, a risk of a conflict of interest arising

where the client qualifies for legal aid but the

solicitor would prefer to act on a contingency fee

basis. In some circumstances the client may, however,

prefer to proceed on a contingency basis, for example

where a high legal aid contribution is required. From

the client&apos;s point of view a contingency fee agreement

would defer the payment of costs to the end of the

case. It is for consideration, therefore, how any

arrangements to introduce contingency fees should

operate alongside the legal aid scheme.



The judges



6


CONFIDENTIAL



Consideration has already been given in this paper to

the question whether the existence of contingency fee

agreements would encourage judges to enhance awards of

costs to successful plaintiffs. It is not clear

whether there is a real danger of enhanced awards. If

there is, the solution would be, probably through rules

of court, to provide that the trial judge was not to be

told whether the plaintiff&apos;s lawyers were acting on a

contingency basis.



The costs rule



4.14 One   significant   difference   between   the U.S.



jurisdictions and the position in England and Wales is

that litigants here are, if unsuccessful, normally

obliged to pay their opponent&apos;s costs. It is likely

that the existence of this rule already acts as a

deterrent against would-be plaintiffs with questionable

causes of action. It is therefore not thought

desirable that it should be removed, even if some form

of speculative or contingency fee is to be allowed.

Given that the introduction of contingency fees could

be of benefit only to plaintiffs, it would not be

appropriate to remove the protection the costs rule

affords defendants against being the victims of

questionable proceedings. The defendant to a civil

action cannot sensibly refuse to take part in

proceedings brought against him and may not easily be

able to defend them as a litigant in person. The very

fact, however, that he is a defendant means (except

4.15 There is no prospect of  lawyers wishing to act on a



contingency basis in criminal proceedings (97% of

defendants in the Crown Court are, In any event,

legally aided), but even if any were, it is thought

that this would be inappropriate on grounds of public

policy. Comments are invited on whether there are

other types of proceedings in respect of which

speculative or contingency funding would be

inappropriate.

CHAPTER 5 - CONCLUSION



5.1 Examination of the arguments and issues arising in the

debate on the introduction of contingency fees suggests

that it is time to consider at least some relaxation of

existing restrictions. The experience in the United

States of America, however, gives pause for thought.

Contingency fees are argued to have encouraged

litigation there; and they have certainly Imposed

significant costs on business in the USA. These

experiences need to be balanced against the argument

that contingency fees make justice more readily

available to a wider section of the population than is

the case in England and Wales.



5.2 Closer examination of the systems operating in England

and Wales and in the USA suggests that there are

differences which may go a long way towards explaining

the frequency of litigation and the high level of

awards of damages in the USA. If contingency fees were

introduced here under the current rules of court, with

judges and not juries determining the amount of damages

awarded, and with the rule that &quot;costs follow the

event&quot; operating as at present, it might be possible to

avoid the adverse effects of contingency fees as they

presently operate in the USA.



5.3 The Government believes that it is appropriate to

consider the introduction in England and Wales of

speculative actions on the Scottish model. It is for

consideration also whether this should be coupled with

the ability to agree an uplift in the costs, payable to

the lawyer in the event of success. This would offer

an incentive to lawyers to undertake speculative

actions. This would be a small, prescribed percentage

of the costs, which was unrelated to the amount of the



1


CONFIDENTIAL



damages or property recovered in the action. A variant

on this could be to allow the lawyer to recover instead

a small, prescribed percentage of the amount of

damages.



5.4 The Government does not believe that it is appropriate



to remove all existing restrictions on the use of

contingency fees. The Government does, however,

invite views on the proposals in the previous paragraph

and on the question whether a restricted form of

contingency fee going beyond that suggested in

paragraph 5.3 should be introduced in England and

Wales. There is no objective evidence available to

support the contention that the introduction of a

contingency fee system in England and Wales would alone

lead to the problems perceived in the USA. The

Government would, however, welcome comments on this

issue.

CHAPTER 1 ? THE PURPOSE OF THE GREEN PAPER



Objectives

1.1



Access to legal services



The Government&apos;s overall objective in publishing this

Green Paper is to see that the public has the best

possible access to legal services and that those

services are of the right quality for the particular

needs of the client. The Government believes that this

is best achieved by ensuring that:-



(a) a market providing legal services operates freely

and efficiently so as to give clients the widest

possible choice of cost effective services; and



(b) the public can be certain that those services are

being supplied by people who have the necessary

expertise to provide a service in the area in

question.



The Government believes that free competition between

the providers of legal services will, through the

discipline of the market, ensure that the public is

provided with the most efficient and effective network

of legal services at the most economical price,

although the Government believes that the public must

also be assured of the competence of the providers of

those services.



The Government believes that the key element in

ensuring an adequate quality of service to the public

is the identification of the education, training,

qualifications and standards of competence and conduct



1.2



Efficiency of service



1.3



Quality of service

CONFIDENTIAL



which are appropriate for those who practise in each

area of legal services. The expertise required of

practitioners should be neither less nor more than the

needs of the work demand, so as to ensure both that the

public can be satisfied as to the competence of the

providers of legal services and at the same time that

they can choose from the largest possible number and

spread of such competent providers. Depending on the

area of legal services in question, such providers may

or may not need to be lawyers.



Competition and standards



1.4 Competition does not obviate the need to maintain the



standards and integrity of the legal profession in

order to safeguard the public. Safeguarding the public

interest is particularly important in relation to the

legal profession, especially with regard to work in the

courts. The question is what balance between

competition and regulation is most likely to achieve

this effect. The onus should be on those who support

restrictions as a way of achieving standards to justify

them. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and

Development&apos;s report, &quot;Competition Policy and the

Professions&quot;, published in 1985, concluded:-



&quot;Experience indicates that actions to promote

competition in some professions do not necessarily

jeopardise the quality of the services provided,

and that many traditional practices excessively

restrain competition and may promote the interests

of the profession and not the public.&quot;



One of the purposes of this Green Paper is to explore

the appropriate balance in respect of the legal

profession;  and it is against these criteria that the



2


CONFIDENTIAL



existing practices and structure of the profession

should be judged.



General competition policy



1.5 The promotion of competition is one of the Government&apos;s

fundamental policies. It is central to the achievement

of some of the Government&apos;s most important objectives.

Competition improves the provision of goods and

services in the interests of industry, commerce, the

professions and the consumer to stimulate an efficient,

wealth-producing and growing economy which can create

the prosperity essential to meet the needs and demands

of the community.



1.6 When effective competition is lacking, clients&apos; choice

is artificially constrained. When there is effective

competition, a customer is able to choose the goods or

services he needs according to what represents best

value in his circumstances in terms of quality and

price. Suppliers have to compete on price; and this in

turn encourages greater efficiency and the development

of new markets. Practices which distort or restrict

competition can deprive the customer of these

benefits. In particular clients need to know what

services are available in order to make an informed

choice between them.



1.7 Both the increased emphasis on allowing market forces

to determine the allocation of resources in the economy

and the changing nature of the market for professional

services prompt a re-examination of the special status

of the professions in UK competition law. Although the

Fair Trading Act 1973 largely applies to the

professions, many professions are currently exempted

from the restrictive trade practices legislation. In

March 1988,   the  Government   published   a   Green Paper



3


CONFIDENTIAL



&quot;Review of Restrictive Trade Practices Policy&quot; (Cm 331)

foreshadowing new legislation. The paper stated that

&quot;there will be no exemptions for professional services

automatically carried across into new legislation

without the merits of each exemption having been

established afresh.&quot;



The consultation period on the March 1988 Green Paper

ended in September 1988, and detailed proposals for the

reform of the restrictive trade practices legislation

will be published shortly. As the new policy will have

a considerable bearing on the legal profession, it

seems appropriate to clarify the Government&apos;s general

intentions in the present Green Paper. The Government

has concluded that there should be no exclusion for the

professions from the new legislation and that the rules

of professional bodies should generally be subject to

the same tests administered by a new competition

authority as other sectors of the economy. The

Government&apos;s view is that, like Article 85 of the

Treaty of Rome, the legislation should prohibit

agreements which have the effect of restricting or

distorting competition, although in the case of

restrictions directly imposed by statute the

competition authority would be able only to offer its

view on the economic effect of the restriction. Where

the authority found that an agreement infringed this

prohibition, it could nevertheless grant an exemption

if it believed the agreement made a sufficient

contribution to economic or technical progress and that

consumers shared adequately in the benefits of this. In

due course, therefore the Law Society and the Bar

Council will have to examine their rules and guidance

not only in the light of the recommendations in this

Green Paper, but also in the light of the tests to be

applied by the new competition authority.

CONFIDENTIAL



Competition and the legal profession



1.9 In the law as in other professions there are a number

of restrictions. Many of these have been defended on

the ground that they protect the interests of the

client. Competition has often been regarded as

inappropriate to or even Incompatible with professional

status and standards and with consumer protection.

Regulation in the legal profession has been achieved

through a combination of direct statutory control and,

more frequently, self-regulation through the

profession&apos;s own rules. Areas such as establishment in

the profession, advertising, setting of fees and

charges and business structure and access to the public

have often been controlled by regulation rather than

being subject to market forces.



1.10 In recent years there have been a number of changes,

some resulting from recommendations by the Monopolies

and Mergers Commission following references under the

Fair Trading Act. For instance, licensed conveyancers

have been allowed to compete with solicitors in England

and Wales for conveyancing work; and advertising

restrictions by solicitors have been considerably

relaxed. Surveys suggest that the result of this

increase in competition has been a reduction in the

price of conveyancing. The Government believes that

there is no reason for excluding the legal profession

from the discipline of competition that applies to the

rest of the economy, provided that the interests of

justice and the needs of those who use or are affected

by the law are safeguarded; and indeed there are wide

areas of the profession where competition already

operates.



  C implications



5


CONFIDENTIAL



1.11 The Government takes the view that, whatever steps may

be taken to give effect to the proposals in this Green

Paper, the UK must ensure it avoids introducing any new

restrictions which might breach the European Community

Treaty. Annex A deals with the possibility of an

increase in competition for the provision of legal

services from European lawyers which may in any event

result from the changes to be brought about in 1992 by

virtue of the Single European Act.



The timing of this review



1.12 The Government reached the decision1 that it was

appropriate to undertake this review now in the light

of the Report &quot;A Time for Change&quot; presented to the

General Council of the Bar and the Council of the Law

Society in July 1988 by the Committee on the Future of

the Legal Profession (the Marre Committee), a committee

which those two bodies had set up in 1986. That Report,

commissioned by the two major professional bodies whose

members work in legal services, was the first

reappraisal of the organisation of the legal

profession since the Royal Commission on Legal Services

(the Benson Commission) published its Report2 in

October 1979. The Marre Committee&apos;s Report indicated a

number of areas where change might now be appropriate.

The fact that the two major professional bodies had

agreed on the need for such a study, taken together

with the conclusions of the report, in turn led the

Government to the view that the time was now right for

it to undertake its own fresh review of the provision

of legal services to ensure that the needs of clients

and the interests of justice would best be safeguarded

in the years ahead.

Consultation



1.13 The Government hopes this examination of the legal

profession will be publicly regarded as a matter of

great importance. These are not matters of concern only

to lawyers. The public have a vital interest from many

different points of view. The Government will therefore

welcome comment from as broad a range of opinion as

possible. At the same time, the Government recognises

that many of the features of the legal profession have

been the subject of recent extensive debate. In the

case of some of these features the Government will,

therefore, in this Green Paper also be indicating its

own provisional view on the right way forward.



1.14 The Government would welcome comments on the proposals

in this document by 2 May 1989. Submissions should be

CHAPTER 2 - THE PROVISION OF LEGAL SERVICES TODAY



The definition of legal services



2.1 A comprehensive definition of what is meant by legal

services is very difficult to frame, but, broadly

speaking, legal services are concerned with the advice,

assistance and representation required by a person in

connection with his rights, duties and liabilities.

These may of course change over the years with the

prevailing values of society, the legislative will of

Parliament and the decisions of the courts. Most

services which are &quot;legal&apos;&apos;, in the sense that a lawyer

often performs them in the ordinary course of his

practice, may also be performed by non-lawyers. In

England and Wales the only legal services which are by

law reserved specifically to lawyers are handling cases

in court and applying for grants of probate or letters

of administration for reward. These matters are

considered further in Chapters 5 and 14.



2.2 In addition, conveyancing for reward is restricted to

lawyers, licensed conveyancers and certain public

officials. Solicitors used to have an effective

monopoly in the provision of conveyancing services but

this monopoly was abolished by Parliament in 1985, when

licensed conveyancers were allowed to enter the

conveyancing market in direct competition with

solicitors. Conveyancing by solicitors and licensed

conveyancers employed by institutions and bodies whose

main business lay in another field was not, however,

allowed at that time, although a framework for this was

subsequently enacted (which has not yet been brought

into force) in the Building Societies Act 1985.

Accordingly the Government has thought it right to re-

examine this field as part of this review; and a

separate   consultation   paper   on   the   subject of



1


CONFIDENTIAL



conveyancing by institutions and other bodies or firms

is therefore being issued in parallel with this Green

Paper.



The providers of legal services



2.3 The Government believes that access to legal services

by those who need them is fundamental to the rule of

law and the preservation of liberty. It is important

to recognise, however, that such access does not

necessarily mean access to a lawyer. Much depends on

the level and type of legal service required. In some

cases a friend or advice agency may suffice; in others

advice by one who is not only a lawyer but also a

specialist lawyer, such as a patent lawyer, may be

essential. Annex   contains background information on

some of those who provide legal services, including

barristers and solicitors.



2.4 A person requiring advice, assistance or representation

needs to be satisfied that the practitioner or agency

from whom assistance is sought is competent to deal

with the matter in issue. Clients are not usually in

the best position to judge competence, particularly if

the matter on which advice is sought is complex and the

practitioner whom they have approached is held out to

have expertise in the area in question. This will be

particularly relevant where the practitioner approached

is a lawyer. The Government believes that it is a

matter of public interest that practitioners holding

themselves out as professional lawyers are nationally

recognised as having standards on which the public can

rely. This means that lawyers must have appropriate

qualifications for the work they undertake; must abide

by recognised standards for doing this work; and must

be subject to effective monitoring to ensure that the

work is properly done.



2


CONFIDENTIAL



Areas of use of legal services



2.5 A  few examples of areas where legal  services may be



needed are set out below by way of illustration. These

are:



(a) the home;



(b) the family;



(c) employment;



(d) social welfare;



(e) consumer protection;



(f) commercial and financial operations;



(g) accidents   and   compensation   for personal

injury; and



(h) involvement with the criminal law.



(a) The home



Conveyancing services are available from a

solicitor or licensed conveyancer (see para 2.2

above). Advice in connection with the mortgage

and insurance cover may be provided by a

solicitor, but may also be provided by a building

society, bank, accountant or other financial

adviser. Disputes arising in connection with the

property, for instance with landlords or

neighbours, can sometimes be resolved amicably,

perhaps with the assistance of a friend as

mediator. If this is not possible, a citizens

advice bureau (CAB) or law centre may be able to

help. If the dispute is so serious that it

becomes necessary to take legal proceedings it is

likely that advice will be required from a lawyer.



(b) The family



A person may need advice, assistance or

representation   in  connection  with  marriage or



3


CONFIDENTIAL



divorce, or with matters relating to children,

elderly relatives, welfare benefits, pensions or

wills. He or she may in many instances turn to

friends, advice agencies such as the CABx or the

National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to

Children, to social workers or to financial

advisers. In more difficult cases, or where

disputes may come before the courts, a person is

likely to seek the assistance of a lawyer.



(c) Employment



Legal services may be needed in connection with a

variety of matters such as contracts of

employment, conditions of work, racial and sexual

discrimination, industrial action, unlawful

behaviour by trade unions, redundancy or

dismissal. Employees, potential.employees and

employers are all likely to need legal services

here. Depending on the nature of the advice,

assistance or representation required they may

turn, for example, to trade unions, trade

associations, CABx, the Commissioner for the

Rights of Trade Union Members, the Advisory

Conciliation and Arbitration Service, the

Commission for Racial Equality, the Equal

Opportunties Commission or to lawyers.



(d) Social welfare



A person may need advice, assistance or

representation in connection with entitlement to

welfare benefits or the resolution of problems

caused by homelessness or nationality. Advice

agencies, such as the CABx, the Child Poverty

Action Group and the United Kingdom Immigrants

Advisory Service, have developed an expertise in

welfare  areas  such as  these.     Help may also be



4


CONFIDENTIAL



provided by law centres, social workers and

lawyers.



(e) Consumer protection



Legal services here can cover a wide area ranging

from rights and liabilities in connection with the

purchase and sale of goods and services and the

whole area of product liability at one end, to

counselling for debt at the other. Advice and

assistance may be available from organisations

such as the National Consumer Council, the

Consumers&apos; Association, CABx and other advice

agencies and trading standards officers. As in

the other examples, a lawyer is most likely to

become involved if complex commercial

documentation is required or court proceedings are

contemplated.



(f) Commercial and financial operations



Legal services here can cover such matters as

setting up and running a business or company,

taxation, bankruptcy and insolvency, intellectual

property rights, commercial conveyancing,

pensions, insurance, matters of contract, the

financial regulation of markets and the effect on

transactions of multi-national operations. A range

of practitioners are in the market for the

provision of legal services in some or all of

these areas, including lawyers both general and

offering a variety of specialist services,

licensed conveyancers, patent agents, banks,

building societies, accountants, insolvency

practitioners and chartered secretaries.



(g)    Accidents and compensation for personal injury



5


(h)



CONFIDENTIAL



Accidents may give rise to both civil and criminal

liability. Legal services are likely to be needed

both by any person who may have caused the

accident and by the person who is injured as a

result of it. Legal services here are likely to

be provided by a lawyer, if the matter seems

likely to become the subject of court proceedings,

but advice and assistance may also be available

from other sources such as trade unions or advice

agencies.



Involvement with the criminal law



Lawyers are the main providers of legal services

here, especially in connection with the conduct of

cases in court. Advice and assistance may,

however, also be available from, for example,

social workers, probation officers and advice

agencies.



Funding of legal services



2.6 This  chapter has  looked very briefly at  some of the



situations where legal services are likely to be

required and where the public need to have access to

them. It has also mentioned some of the practitioners

and agencies who may provide such services. The

Government thinks it right that these services should

be funded in a variety of ways. Those who cannot afford

to pay for the legal services they require can often

get the help they need from organisations supported by

public funds; and, where necessary, they can get access

to lawyers through the legal aid and advice schemes.

Those who can themselves afford to pay for the services

they require want to be sure they are using their money

to obtain the service which is best suited to their

needs.

2.7



CONFIDENTIAL



So far as publicly funded work is concerned, the

Government believes that the new Legal Aid Act,

together with the Legal Aid Board it has created to

take over the administration of legal aid from 1 April

1989, will provide a system that is efficient and

effective and give to all concerned the best possible

value in return for the money spent on it, and which

will have the flexibility to meet changing demands and

circumstances.



2.8



In privately funded work also the Government is keen to

encourage new approaches. One idea which has attracted

much attention in recent years - contingency fees - is

the subject of a separate consultation paper issued in

parallel   with   this   Green  Paper. The Government&apos;s



proposals to increase the possibilities for advertising

by the legal profession, and thereby to enable the

public to make more informed and cost-effective choices

among the providers of legal services, can be found in

Chapter 13 of this Green Paper.

CHAPTER 3 ? LEGAL EDUCATION AND THE GROWTH OF SPECIALISATION



The objective of legal education



3.1 The   Report   of   the   Committee   on   Legal Education



published in March 1971 (Ormrod) (Cmnd. 4595) concluded

that:-



&quot;Legal education should not attempt to equip the

lawyer at qualification with a comprehensive

knowledge of every subject he may encounter in

practice; instead, it should concentrate on

providing him with the best possible general

introduction so as to enable him, with the help of

experience and continuing education after

qualification, to become a fully equipped member

of the   profession.&quot;



The Government believes this objective for legal

education is still valid today.



3.2 The Government also believes that it is consistent with



its objectives for the provision of legal services that

practitioners must be able to show their clients that

they possess the necessary competence to perform the

particular service sought from them, especially where

the service requires the possession of specialist

expertise. The Government believes that it is not of

itself sufficient for practitioners to belong to a

particular branch of the legal profession, or, in some

cases, to other professions.



Current position



3.3 Entry to the legal  profession requires  completion of



three training stages, an academic, a vocational and a

practical   stage.   Entrants   normally  complete the



1


CONFIDENTIAL



academic stage by taking a law degree. Thereafter,

barristers and solicitors have separate systems of

vocational and practical training.



3.4 Both branches of the profession are in the process of

conducting reviews of their own training arrangements

with the aim of making these more relevant to the needs

of practice. The Bar intend to introduce a new finals

course in the autumn of 1989 which will emphasise

practical skills such as advocacy, drafting, advising

and negotiating; and there are at present moves to

formalise the minimum contents of pupillage. The Law

Society are considering including additional specialist

law options during the finals course, training in

management and communication skills and the extension

of compulsory post-qualification training beyond the

first three years, in order to keep solicitors abreast

of developments in the law.



The growing importance of specialisation



3.5 The thrust of these changes is to emphasise the

growing importance, which has been noted over the past

decade, of the acquisition of specialist skills by

practitioners. The need for this was recognised by the

Royal Commission on Legal Services as long ago as 1979

when it recommended that the formal introduction of

specialisation into the solicitors&apos; profession would

be of significant benefit to the public (paras 22.55

and 27.23). In 1987, in the White Paper &quot;Legal Aid

in England and Wales: A New Framework&quot; (Cm 118 para

58), the Government stated that it was desirable that

solicitors doing legal aid work should have special

skills in the area concerned, and that it was attracted

by the idea that legal aid work should be done by

panels of solicitors with specialist experience in each

category.     In  1988  the Civil  Justice Review  (Cm 394



2


CONFIDENTIAL



para 212) recommended that specialisation schemes

should be established for all the main areas of

litigation; and Marre (para 16.17) recognised that

&quot;specialisation is inevitable.&quot;



Existing specialist panels of solicitors



3.6 The  Law  Society  have  already  established specialist



panels for child care and mental health work. The

Child Care Panel was set up in 1984 and currently has

around 1,500 members. The Mental Health Panel was set

up in 1983 and currently has around 200 members.

Membership of both these panels is dependent on

experience in advocacy before the relevant tribunals,

attendance on approved courses and interviews. Also

under the duty solicitor schemes there are some

thousands of solicitors (and their representatives)

who provide duty solicitor services. They need to have

a minimum of 12 months&apos; advocacy experience and are

interviewed by local practitioners to confirm their

suitability. The Law Society are also currently

considering the extension of specialist panels into

other areas of work such as planning, personal injury

and medical negligence.



Merits of specialist panels



3.7 The main advantage of specialist panels to the public



is to give them an easier and more informed choice of

practitioners who they can be assured are skilled in a

particular field of law. At the same time, not every

area of law requires specialist expertise. Care must

be taken to ensure that only those areas of law which

need to be specialisms are designated as such, and that

the criteria for recognition as a specialist are high

enough to ensure competence and maintain standards but

no higher. The criteria must not become unnecessary

obstacles which discourage practitioners from becoming



3


CONFIDENTIAL



specialists, or which artificially limit the supply of

legal services to the public in a particular field.



Increasing the supply of specialists



3.8 The Government considers that the way to ensure that



the expertise of practitioners is best matched to the

particular demands of the work in question, and that

the public has the widest possible choice of competent

practitioners in the various fields of law, is for

areas of specialist expertise to be developed, with

standards of education, training, qualifications and

conduct appropriate to each. It may be that some of

these specialisms will not require the services of

lawyers.    The following questions then arise:



(a) which areas of work require specialist

expertise;



(b) what is the appropriate level of education,

qualifications and training required to be a

specialist in any given area;



(c) who is to provide the necessary education,

qualifications and training; and



(d) how are appropriate standards of conduct to

be set for practitioners and who is to

monitor these standards.



These questions are addressed in paras 3.11 to 3.13

below and in Chapter 4.



Advertising of specialisms



3.9 An important purpose of specialisms is to provide the



public with more information to help them choose a

practitioner appropriate for their needs. Accredited

specialists should therefore be able to advertise

themselves as such to the general public. The Bar and

the Law Society already operate a limited form of

advertising   through   listings   in  their professional



4


CONFIDENTIAL



directories; and the Law Society permits also the

circulation of lists of members on, for instance the

Mental Health Panel, to interested organisations such

as CABx, social services departments, psychiatric units

and the courts. Further consideration should, however,

be given by both individual practitioners and the

relevant professional bodies to allowing those

practitioners who qualify as specialists (see also

Chapter 13 below) to advertise themselves as such. This

does not mean that non-specialists should not be

allowed to advertise their services; merely that only

those who are recognised specialists in a particular

field should be able to hold themselves out as such to

potential clients.



Exclusive specialisms



3.10 The Government does not believe that practice in an

area which has been designated as a specialism should

be restricted to those recognised as specialist

practitioners alone. Such an approach could create new

entry barriers, put up costs, deprive clients of

choice and protect those within the specialism from

competition from those outside it. An exception is

advocacy, where the Government believes that the needs

of the administration of justice require special

arrangements to be made. This is considered in

Chapter 5 below.



Recognition of specialisms



3.11 The Government believes that a formal mechanism should

be established to advise on the matters outlined in

para 3.8. The Government believes also that, in order

to ensure that the public know that recognition as a

specialist practitioner has real value, the

requirements for the education, training and

qualifications  of  recognised  providers  of specialist



5


CONFIDENTIAL



services should in future be approved by the Lord

Chancellor, after he has taken advice from his

Advisory Committee on Legal Education. The arrangements

for codes of conduct are set out in Chapter 4. The

Government expects there will in future be a variety of

providers of such specialist services.



The Lord Chancellor&apos;s Advisory Committee on Legal Education and

Conduct



3.12 The   Lord  Chancellor&apos;s  Advisory  Committee  on Legal



Education (the Advisory Committee) was set up in 1971

as a result of recommendations in the Report of the

Committee on Legal Education (Ormrod, Cm 8595). In

order that it may carry out the new functions the

Government now proposes for it, the Advisory Committee

should be reconstituted as a vigorous and active

standing committee, dealing with both education and

conduct, which would meet regularly. To accord with its

new role this Committee should in future be known as

the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Advisory Committee on Legal

Education and Conduct. The Committee&apos;s terms of

reference should be:



(a) To keep under review the education and training of

lawyers at the academic, vocational and post-

vocational stages to ensure that that education

and training is relevant to the needs of practice

and to the efficient delivery of legal services to

the public. (A possible framework for the

academic and vocational training of lawyers is set

out at Annex C, which the Advisory Committee would

be invited to consider at an early stage);



(b) To consider, whether on its own initiative or when

requested to do so by the Lord Chancellor:



6


CONFIDENTIAL



(i) what   areas  of   legal   services require



specialist expertise and whether that

specialist expertise needs to be

provided by a fully trained lawyer; and



(11) what the education,   qualifications and



training of specialists, both legal

practitioners and others, should be in

the various areas designated as

requiring specialist expertise;



(c) To keep under review, whether on its own

initiative or when requested to do so by the Lord

Chancellor, the accredited specialisms and the

education and training requirements for these to

ensure that they continue to meet the needs of the

public for the efficient delivery of legal

services; and



(d) To advise the Lord Chancellor on the appropriate

codes of conduct which should be followed by

lawyers and other practitioners recognised as

suitable to undertake work in the recognised

specialisms. (It is envisaged that at least two

separate codes of conduct will be needed to cover:



(i) advice work; and



(ii) advocacy.



This last area is considered further in

Chapter 4.)



The Advisory Committee should submit an annual report

covering all these areas to the Lord Chancellor. The

annual report would be laid before Parliament. The

Committee might also submit proposals and

recommendations to the Bar or the Law Society or to

other professional bodies, where it considers this

appropriate or where such bodies ask for its advice.



7


CONFIDENTIAL



3.13 Final decisions on whether a particular specialist area

of expertise should be recognised as such and on what

standards of education and training are appropriate in

each case should rest with the Lord Chancellor,

following advice from the Advisory Committee. In

addition, before recognising any particular

professional body as competent to authorise individual

practitioners as specialists in a particular field, the

Lord Chancellor would have to be satisfied that the

professional body could:



(a) provide the appropriate education and

training, either itself or, on a repayment

basis, with the assistance of appropriate

educational establishments; and



(b) provide sufficient control over its members

to ensure that satisfactory standards of

conduct and behaviour are maintained and

enforced (This is considered further in

Chapter 4).



It would of course be for the various interested

professional bodies to decide what they wished to offer

by way of education, training and discipline in the

light of the standards set by the Lord Chancellor for

the various specialisms.



3.14 Under the proposals outlined above, the Advisory

Committee will in future play an important role, both

in ensuring the supply of legal services of quality to

the public and in maintaining the standards of conduct

expected of practitioners. The Government believes that

the composition of the Advisory Committee should

reflect this new role by containing a majority of lay

members.  Accordingly the Government proposes that the



8


CONFIDENTIAL



new Advisory Committee should consist of 15 members,

all appointed by the Lord Chancellor and comprising:-



3.15



Summary

3.16



(a) a chairman, who should be a judge;



(b) 2 barristers appointed after consultation with the

General Council of the Bar;



(c) 2 solicitors appointed after consultation with the

Council of the Law Society;



(d) 2 academic representatives - appointed after

consultation with those representing the

university and polytechnic law schools; and



(e) 8 lay representatives appointed after wide

consultation.



The Government proposes that the secretariat of the

Advisory Committee should be provided by the Lord

Chancellor&apos;s Department.



The Government would welcome views on the proposals in

this chapter, in particular on:



(a) the proposed terms of  reference of  the Advisory

Committee;



(b) the proposed membership of the Advisory Committee;

and



(c) the   suggestions   for  academic   and vocational

training set out at Annex C.



9


CHAPTER 4 - MAINTENANCE OF PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS



4.1 The Government believes that it should be the duty of

any professional body to ensure that the standards of

competence and professional conduct among persons who

practise in that profession are sufficient to secure

adequate protection for clients, and that the services

provided by such persons are provided both

economically and efficiently.



4.2 This means that such a professional body must ensure

that:-



(a) professional services are offered efficiently and

with the required degree of professional

expertise;



(b) any complaints about services are investigated

promptly, thoroughly and impartially;



(c) matters are put right as quickly as possible with,

where necessary, appropriate recompense;



(d) where a professional man or woman fails to meet

the required standards, appropriate action is

taken; and



(e) where the failure amounts to professional

misconduct, appropriate sanctions are imposed, if

necessary amounting to expulsion from the

profession.



4.3 The  Government  believes  that  those  who  provide the



public with legal services must do so in a competent

and professional manner.  It should therefore be one of



1


CONFIDENTIAL



the functions of the legal professional bodies to

ensure this happens.



(A) Standards of conduct

Present arrangements



4.4 At  present  the Bar  and  the  Law Society provide for



standards of conduct in different ways:-



(a)   The Bar



The Bar has a written Code of Conduct. Last year it was

thoroughly revised. The new version is due to come into

force on 1 February 1989. It sets out the general

principles which apply to all barristers, whether in

independent practice or in employment, including their

general duties, the rules on acceptance of

instructions and on withdrawal from a case, the duty of

the barrister to the client, the way a case should be

conducted both in and out of court, and what is to

happen when a conflict of interest arises.



The Law Society



The Law Society publishes Practice Rules. The current

rules are the 1988 Practice Rules which govern, for

example, obtaining instructions, accounting for

commissions and the supervision of a solicitor&apos;s

office; and when a solicitor may act for both vendor

and purchaser. Referrals and introductions and

publicity are also touched on briefly in the Rules but

are dealt with in more detail in separate codes. The

Rules do not, however, provide for matters of good

practice such as proper communication with the client

and the avoidance of delay.



4.7 The   Law   Society   publishes   a   guide   called &quot;The



Professional Conduct of Solicitors&quot; to deal with these

matters of practice.  This contains detailed statements



(b)

4.6



2


CONFIDENTIAL



of principle together with an indication of best or

acceptable practice. Although such an explanation of

these principles is obviously helpful, it remains odd

that what is intended to lead to sound practice does

not appear in the Practice Rules, especially as any

breach of these principles might put solicitors at risk

of allegations of inadequate professional services or

professional misconduct.



Codes of professional conduct and standards



4.8 The  Government  believes  there  are  certain  areas of



practice which are of such fundamental importance

that:-



(a) there should be clear written statements of the

practice which must be followed;



(b) these written statements should be set out in a

way which is easily accessible both to lawyers and

their clients; and



(c) failure to observe these practice rules should be

a cause for disciplinary proceedings.



4.9 Recommendations on these lines were made by Benson in

1979. The Civil Justice Review published in June 1988

(Cm 394) also recommended (R 18(1)) that both the Bar

and the Law Society should issue specific written

professional standards relating to the conduct of all

principal types of litigation.



4.10 The Law Society published written standards in 1985 to

cover responsibility for the client&apos;s case,

communication with the client and information on costs.

They   appear   as   an   appendix   in   &quot;The Professional



3


CONFIDENTIAL



Conduct of Solicitors&quot;. The introduction to these

standards states that:-



&quot;They are guidelines. They will be helpful in all

cases. It will be for the solicitor to judge when

a standard can be ignored, but also for him to

justify his decision should the client feel

aggrieved.&quot;



The Government is not convinced that either this

statement or the positioning of the standards in the

Guide adequately underlines their importance.



The Bar has not yet introduced any standards of this

kind, although it is about to do so.



The Government&apos;s proposals



4.11 The Government now therefore proposes that there should



in future be written codes which specifically set

professional standards. The Government envisages that

two separate professional codes will be necessary. One

will deal with the provision of legal advice and

assistance generally. The other will cover the

particular issues which are connected with the handling

of briefs and the general conduct of cases in court,

since in advocacy work the maintenance of standards

both of skill and integrity has much to do with the

independence of the advocate, his regular application

to his work in the courts, and with his need to satisfy

the requirements of a client able to make an informed

choice of advocate. The areas to be covered are set out

in broad terms in paras 4.14 and 4.15 below. The Lord

Chancellor will look for advice on what should be the

principles embodied in these codes from his Advisory

Committee on Legal Education and Conduct, whose

membership and terms of reference will be broadened so



4


CONFIDENTIAL



as to encompass this function (see Chapter 3,

paras 3.12-3.15 of this Green Paper). Professional

bodies whose members wish to offer advisory and

advocacy services will be required to submit their

proposed codes of conduct for the endorsement of the

Advisory Committee whose role it will be to ensure that

such codes of conduct embody the approved principles.



4.12 The Government proposes that the Lord Chancellor should

prescribe by statutory instrument the principles which

must be embodied in these codes so as to ensure that

they have Parliamentary approval. The Government is not

prepared to leave it to the legal profession to settle

the principles which these codes should adopt because

they will be of such great importance both to the

administration of justice and to the public. Moreover,

in the future the legal profession is likely to

continue to contain a number of different professional

bodies; and it is important that they should all be

subject to minimum professional standards.



4.13 A code setting out the approved general principles

would be a requirement for any profession whose

members offered legal advice for reward; and a code

dealing similarly with the conduct of cases in court

would be a requirement for all advocates (see

Chapter 5 below). The relevant professional bodies

would be expected to enforce the codes and to satisfy

the Advisory Committee that they had adequate

arrangements in place for this purpose. Failure to

comply with any requirement of the codes would render a

practitioner liable to a range of sanctions including a

reduction in fees after proceedings conducted by the

appropriate professional body. In addition all courts

should   have  power   to   require   any  advocate   to pay



5


CONFIDENTIAL



personally costs incurred by any party to an action, if

the court judged this appropriate.



Code 1 Provision of legal advice and assistance



4.14 A client seeking advice and assistance should be given

full and proper advice about his case. Poor

communication seems to be the cause of most complaints

about solicitors. This code will therefore need to

provide that:-



(a) the client is given a full explanation of the

issues and what needs to be done;



(b) the client is kept fully informed about the

progress of his case;



(c) the client is given a proper explanation of the

fees and costs likely to be incurred: this

explanation should be supplied both orally and in

writing;



(d) the client understands who is responsible for the

overall supervision and the day to day handling of

his case; and



(e) the practitioner conducts the case in an

efficient manner.



Code 2 Advocacy and ancillary matters



4.15 This code will need to ensure that:-



(a) incoming work is managed in chambers or offices in

such a way that there is adequate pre-trial

preparation of cases; and that in particular:-



6


CONFIDENTIAL



(i) early  conferences   are   arranged when



necessary;



(11) in   criminal   cases   there   is careful



advice about the intended plea, in order

to avoid changes of plea at the trial so

far as possible;



(ill) where  possible,   issues  in dispute are



identified before trial; and



(iv) cases are properly prepared for court;



(b) cases  in court are conducted competently and in

the light of clear ethical standards so that:-



(i) advocates  are  aware  of  the  paramountcy of

their duty to the court,  their duties to the

client, to witnesses and to third parties;

and



(ii) advocates   do   not   waste   the   time  of the

court;



and



(c) defence and prosecution advocates are aware of

their special responsibilities in criminal cases;

in particular that advocates who provide

representation in the more serious cases which are

tried in the Crown Court should not, in any given

case, have been involved also in the investigation

of the evidence.



(B) Complaints and discipline

Present arrangements

(a)   The Bar



7


CONFIDENTIAL



4.16 A  barrister  is   immune  from  an  action  for negligence



brought by a client in respect of the conduct and

management of a case in court (see Chapter 6 below).

He or she is not, however, immune from actions for

negligence in other situations. Indeed all practising

barristers are required to have professional indemnity

insurance of  250,000 for each and every claim. A

barrister is also subject to professional discipline

in respect of the conduct of a case whether in or out

of court.



4.17 Complaints against barristers come largely from members



of the public, although some come also from the

judiciary or magistracy, court officials, other

barristers and solicitors. The present machinery for

dealing with complaints is set out in Annex D, Part 1.



(b)   The Law Society



4.18 All solicitors in practice are required to be covered



by professional indemnity insurance against loss

arising from civil liability claims. In addition the

Law Society administers a fund to provide compensation

in cases of dishonesty by solicitors or their employers

or of failure by a solicitor to account for any money

in connection with any trust of which he or she is or

was a trustee. These arrangements go wider than those

covering barristers, but barristers do not need such

wide protection because they do not carry out

transactions on behalf of clients or handle clients ?

money.



4.19 Complaints   against   solicitors  may  raise   issues of



conduct or inadequate professional services - &quot;shoddy

work.&quot; Such complaints must be made to the Solicitors&apos;

Complaints Bureau where most will be settled. A

minority  of   complaints  will,   however,   be considered



8


CONFIDENTIAL



also by the Solicitors&apos; Disciplinary Tribunal, the

High Court or the Lay Observer. The details of these

arrangements are set out in Annex D, Part 2.



Criticism of existing procedures: the Law Society

4.20 Criticism   of   the   complaints   procedures   has been



directed largely at the Law Society. It is not

surprising that there are more complaints about

solicitors than barristers. There are ten times as many

solicitors in practice. Furthermore, solicitors have a

more direct and longer term involvement with their

clients. In 1987 the Solicitors Complaints Bureau (SCB)

received in excess of 17,800 complaints, while the Bar

only received perhaps 1% of that number.



4.21 The SCB was set up in 1986.  Previously complaints had



been handled by the Law Society&apos;s Professional

Purposes Department; and this arrangement had attracted

criticism on the ground that it could not be shown to

be sufficiently impartial. Both the Bar and the Law

Society combine the roles of supervision and

professional representation. It is obviously easier to

demonstrate the independence and impartiality

necessary for handling disciplinary cases when the two

roles are split (as for example is the case with the

General Medical Council and the British Medical

Association). The Law Society appear to have hoped

that, by setting up the SCB in a separate

establishment, with a lay-dominated Investigation

Committee to monitor its performance, they would,

notwithstanding that they fund the SCB, enable it to be

regarded as independent of the Law Society. It is not

clear that they have as yet been successful in this.



Problems with the Law Society&apos;s present arrangements



9


CONFIDENTIAL



4.22 The Government considers that problems lie particularly

in the following areas:



(a) The definition of shoddy work



4.23 The Law Society&apos;s investigation of complaints was

confined to matters of conduct until the beginning of

1987, but it may now also, under powers granted by the

Administration of Justice Act 1985, investigate

complaints about inadequate professional services,

which are often described as &quot;shoddy work&quot;. The

Chairman of the Adjudication Committee in the first

report of the SCB explained that his committee had

been in difficulty in identifying what the expression

&quot;shoddy work&quot; might cover. The Government believes the

difficulty does not arise only because this is a new

jurisdiction, but also because it is at present

difficult to identify what precise standards

solicitors are expected to meet. The Government

suggests that the adoption of clear standards in a

written code of conduct will make the task of the

Adjudication Committee easier.



(b) Negligence cases



4.24 The SCB is unwilling to take action where it appears

that the complaint raises a question of negligence as

opposed to professional misconduct. It explains the two

expressions as follows:-



(1) &quot;Negligence is a civil ,offence&apos; where the

solicitor has been inadvertently incompetent. In

negligence the solicitor is in breach of his duty

of care to the client and as a consequence the

client has suffered loss in money terms.&quot;



(ii) &quot;Professional misconduct is [broadly] wilful

misbehaviour  by  a  solicitor  which  may involve



10


CONFIDENTIAL



disregarding certain rules of conduct or may be of

a type that could bring the profession into

disrepute in dealings with a client. It may now

include incompetence falling short of negligence.&quot;



4.25 The SCB explains that it cannot act in negligence cases

because &quot;negligence is a matter of law, which must be

settled in the last resort by the courts.&quot; Instead,

when the SCB identifies a possible negligence case, it

sends the complainant to a solicitor on one of its

negligence panels.



4.26 In his 1987 report (Cm 626) the Lay Observer comments

at para 47:-



&quot;Even if a solicitor might have been negligent,

would it not be appropriate in some cases to deal

with the complaint under the shoddy work powers

rather than by proceedings for negligence, for

example where a reduction in the bill is likely to

be the appropriate remedy.&quot;



The Government agrees with this and also with the Lay

Observer&apos;s comment elsewhere in his report that the

Law Society needs to consider how far the investigation

of complaints is hampered by solicitors who refuse to

co-operate on the grounds that this might prejudice

their case in proceedings. Such prejudice is not

inevitable. In some cases, a finding of shoddy work

will result in financial recompense and settlement. In

others the finding will help to demonstrate a poor

performance but will not necessarily imply that the

performance was caused by negligence. The possibility

of court proceedings should not be used as an excuse to

prevent or delay making right what has gone wrong,

especially when the damage is perfectly clear.



11


CONFIDENTIAL



(c) Confusion of choice



4.27 A complaint may raise issues besides shoddy work or

negligence, where there are several ways to take the

issue forward. For example, in some cases where it

appears that the solicitor&apos;s fees are too high, it is

possible to apply either to the Law Society for a

remuneration certificate or to the Court for taxation.

The Government agrees with the Lay Observer that the

Law Society needs to make more effort to explain to the

public the nature of its various powers and the

relationship between them.



(d) Delay



4.28 The SCB admits that its handling of complaints is often

subject to delay. This may be due partly to its high

workload and partly to solicitors failing to reply to

the Bureau&apos;s letters. The average shoddy work

complaint at present takes six months to work through

the system.



4.29 The Government expects the Law Society to take measures

to cut down the number of cases which need to go

through the full SCB procedure. A voluntary

arbitration procedure for use in negligence cases

already exists, but it is rarely used. Attempts to

reach a settlement in cases where the client is

concerned principally to get the work done have been

more successful. The Government would like to see the

Law Society encourage the development of local

conciliation schemes which could cover all complaints.

There are 127 local law societies. The Government

believes there is scope for them to play a more active

role in settling disputes between aggrieved clients and

solicitors.



12


CONFIDENTIAL



Legal Services Ombudsman



The SCB Investigation Committee hopes that its lay

element and its independence help to reduce the

workload of the Lay Observer, but it seems clear that

the SCB has not yet developed machinery for dealing

with complaints which achieves public confidence. The

Lay Observer, as explained above, has powers to examine

the way complaints are handled but not to re-examine

the complaint. The Government believes, therefore, that

the Lay Observer&apos;s powers are inadequate. The

Government considers that the Lay Observer is hampered

in his work by having limited powers to take cases to

the Solicitors&apos; Disciplinary Tribunal, no powers of

referral to the SCB, and no powers to reinvestigate the

case or to award compensation. Finally it is anomalous

that there is no equivalent office holder to review the

complaints procedure of the Bar.



Accordingly the Government proposes to abolish the

office of Lay Observer. Instead, the Lord Chancellor

will appoint a Legal Services Ombudsman, who will have

power to:-



(a) examine allegations about the way complaints about

barristers, solicitors or any other new legal

professionals, who may establish themselves in the

future, have been handled by the relevant

professional body;



(b) reinvestigate cases where he considers it

necessary;



(c) refer cases back to any body which originally

investigated the complaint or to any disciplinary

tribunal which has power to consider the

complaint (this would be the normal course in the



13


CONFIDENTIAL



case of decisions of the High Court in respect of

solicitors&apos; conduct or decisions of the Visitors

(who are judges of the High Court: see para 3 of

Annex D) in respect of barristers&apos; conduct);



(d) recommend the payment of compensation by the

professional body concerned;



(e) recommend changes or improvements to the

complaints procedures of the Bar, the Law Society

or any other relevant supervisory body; and



(f) publicise his decisions.

Summary of proposals



4.32 (a)    The  Government   intends   to  prescribe,   by  way of



statutory instrument, clear principles and

standards, for embodiment in two codes of conduct

to be adopted by professional bodies, covering:-



(i) the provision of legal advice and assistance;

and



(ii) the preparation of cases and their conduct in

court.



Failure to observe any requirement of the principles

and standards set out in these codes would be a cause

for disciplinary proceedings.



(b) The Government believes that each professional

body should demonstrate that it has a supervisory

body to investigate complaints which can be shown

to be both impartial and independent of the

profession&apos;s representational body.



14


CONFIDENTIAL



(c) The Government intends to replace the Lay Observer

by a Legal Services Ombudsman who would have

greater powers to examine the handling of

complaints by the Bar, the Law Society and any

other legal professional body.



15


CHAPTER 5 ? ADVOCACY



Introduction



5.1 A right of audience entitles a person to address a

court of law on behalf of another. In England and

Wales, restrictions are at present placed, either by

statute or by usage regulated by the judges, on rights

of audience in all courts of law. The Government wishes

to examine in this chapter whether the current

restrictions on rights of audience before the courts

are compatible with the key principles outlined in

Chapter 1, particularly in the light of the matters

discussed in Chapter 3.



5.2 A summary of rights of audience in the courts of

England and Wales is at Annex E.



The case for restricting rights of audience



5.3 Under an adversarial system such as ours, the

presentation of both the facts and the legal

authorities on which the judge&apos;s decision will be

based is the responsibility of the advocates

representing the parties concerned. Judges in this

country work largely without legal support, and their

judgments are prepared entirely by themselves with no

assistance, so far as law is concerned, except the

representations of the parties. They therefore need to

be able to rely on the strength and adequacy of the

representations of the advocates appearing before them.

An inexperienced or incompetent advocate who cannot

present a case properly is not only unlikely to be able

to do justice to his or her client&apos;s case, but is also

likely to waste the time of the court and may by his

failure bring about injustice. The ensuing delay,

additional expense and inconvenience can affect not

only the case in question but also other cases waiting



1


5.4



5.5



CONFIDENTIAL



their turn to be heard; and indeed the state of the law

generally.



It is not only an advocate&apos;s competence which is

important here; it is also the standards of integrity

and ethical practice required of advocates which have

developed over many years to ensure that the quality of

justice is maintained. Judges need to be able to

trust the word of the advocates appearing before them

and to rely on them not to mislead the court; otherwise

proof of every matter would be required, leading to

unnecessary delay and inconvenience for all concerned.



It is also important to recognise that judges give

judgments with reasons which can be used in other

cases. Because of the doctrine of judicial precedent

(under which decisions of the higher courts on matters

of law are treated as binding on the lower courts),

such judgments, particularly in the higher courts, play

a vital role in the development of English law. It is

for this reason that the judges look to the advocates

appearing before them to cite all relevant authorities

to the court, whether or not these authorities are

favourable to their case. The presentation of cogent

legal argument is a highly skilled task requiring not

only a knowledge of the law but also constant practice

in advocacy.



5.6



For these reasons it is necessary to ensure, in

considering what the appropriate criteria are for

granting rights of audience, that such rights are

given, particularly in the higher courts, only to those

who will not only give the right quality of service to

the parties involved in a case, but who will also

enable the quality of justice and the standards of

advocacy to be maintained.



2


CONFIDENTIAL



Obtaining rights of audience



5.7 The Government considers that, for the reasons given

above, rights of audience in the courts should be

restricted to those who are properly trained, suitably

experienced and subject to codes of conduct which

maintain standards, although this should not affect an

individual&apos;s right to self-representation. The

Government therefore, as stated in Chapter 3, believes

that advocacy in the courts should be an area where

recognised professional expertise is required. Subject

to that, the Government believes, in accordance with

the principles set out in Chapter 1, that the public

should have the widest possible choice among recognised

advocates who are free to compete fairly with one

another for the business available from clients.



5.8 Accordingly the Government believes that, for the

future, rights of audience before particular courts

should depend only upon whether advocates can

demonstrate that they have the appropriate education,

training and qualifications and are bound by

appropriate codes of conduct. Advocates&apos; professional

bodies should have to satisfy the Lord Chancellor that

their members are fit and proper people to appear as

advocates before the court or courts in question in

order to obtain rights of audience for them. The

necessary requirements would vary, depending on the

level and nature of the court concerned, and would need

to be worked out in detail for each court, but the

present distinctions in the treatment by the courts of

the different branches of the profession would

disappear. The basic premise is that the satisfaction

of such requirements should, for the future, alone be

the test for granting rights of audience; and not

whether an advocate happened by initial qualification



3


CONFIDENTIAL



to be a lawyer, whether a barrister or a solicitor, and

whether in private practice or employed.



Lay advocacy



5.9 Lay representatives already appear in a wide variety of

proceedings;  and the Government thinks that it may now

be right for lay representatives to be granted rights

of audience in the courts on behalf of others in some

instances.   The  Civil  Justice  Review  R.48   (Cm. 394)

recommended  that  in  small  claims  cases  and debt and

housing  cases   in  the  County  Court,   litigants should

have the right to be assisted or represented by the lay

representative of their choice, although the court, on

giving reasons,  would have the discretion to restrict

the involvement of corrupt or unruly representatives,

and,   where  necessary,   to  exclude  them  entirely. Any

rights   of   audience   granted   to   lay   advocates would

supplement,   and  not   replace,   the  existing   rights of

those  who  represent  themselves  to  have  a  friend in

court who assists but does not represent them.  In other

instances,  specialist practitioners who are not lawyers

should   be   able  to  exercise  rights   of   audience in

perhaps a limited range of cases appropriate to their

specialist   expertise   if   they   can   satisfy the

appropriate  tests.   The  aim  should  be  to  ensure the

widest possible choice of advocate for the client while

at the same time ensuring that adequate standards of

competence and probity are maintained.  The whole area

of   lay  representation  should  be  considered  by the

Advisory Committee.



Employed lawyers



5.10 The Government also believes that it should be possible

for appropriate codes of conduct to guard against any

conflicts of interest which might arise in the case of

employed   lawyers;   and   to   secure   the   degree of



4


CONFIDENTIAL



responsibility to the court and independence from the

parties which is vital if the court is to rely on their

representation. A universal prohibition on rights of

audience for employed lawyers would therefore appear to

be an unnecessary constraint.



5.11 In  particular,   in  the  case  of  prosecution  work the

Government  endorses  the  principle  recommended  in the

Report of  the Royal  Commission on Criminal Procedure

(Cmnd 8092)   published   in  January 1981   (the Philips

Report)   that  there  should  be  a  clear  separation of

responsibility for the conduct of the prosecution from

the conduct of the investigative process (paras 7.3 and

7.7).   The  Crown  Prosecution  Service,   created   in the

wake   of   the   Philips   Report,   clearly   follows this

principle  since  it  is both independent of  the police

and accountable to the Attorney-General rather than the

Home Secretary who has Ministerial responsibility for

the police.  The Government therefore considers that it

is likely to be feasible as a matter of principle for

lawyers  employed  by  the  Crown  Prosecution  Service to

have  rights  of  audience  in  all  the  criminal courts,

provided that they can satisfy the appropriate advocacy

requirements   and  undertake  to  abide  by  the relevant

codes  of  conduct;   and provided that  it is adequately

recognised by practical safeguards that their duty to

the court must take precedence over any responsibility

they may have to their employer.



5.12 So far as rights of audience for lawyers employed on

prosecution work by other Government departments are

concerned, and also for lawyers employed by other

bodies which undertake prosecutions, consideration will

need to be given to how they might meet the Philips

principle, especially in the case of the more serious

cases which are tried in the Crown Court,   before any



5


CONFIDENTIAL



changes in their rights of audience are made. In the

case of the prosecution work carried out by Government

departments, departments would at least need to be

able to demonstrate a clear structural separation in

the arrangement of the department of those staff

involved in investigations from those responsible for

conducting prosecutions; and, in some cases, the

solution might be to transfer responsibility for the

lawyers who have carriage of prosecution work from the

department concerned to the Attorney-General.



Role of the Advisory Committee



5.13 The  Government   proposes   that  the   reconstituted Lord



Chancellor&apos;s Advisory Committee on Legal Education and

Conduct (see Chapter 3) should be responsible for

advising the Lord Chancellor on the education,

qualifications and training of advocates appropriate

for each of the various courts. The Lord Chancellor

should be required to consult the judiciary before

reaching decisions as a result of advice tendered by

the Advisory Committee, although the final decision

would be for him. It would seem to be appropriate that

decisions by the Lord Chancellor on rights of audience

should be put into effect by means of subordinate

legislation which is subject to Parliamentary control.

This would provide the degree of direct Parliamentary

control that would be appropriate in this important

area, directly affecting, as it does, the public&apos;s

access to the courts.



Advocacy certificates



5.14 The Government proposes, subject to any advice it might



receive from the reconstituted Advisory Committee, that

rights of audience for all advocates should be

dependent on a certificate of competence. This

certificate   could   be   either   full,   entitling the



6


CONFIDENTIAL



advocate to rights of audience in all courts, or

limited, entitling the advocate to rights of audience

in only the lower courts. (See paras 5.24 to 5.33 below

for further details of these certificates.)



5.15 The Government suggests that, in order to obtain a full

advocate&apos;s certificate, those who wish to practise in

all courts in England and Wales should need to:



(a) undertake an appropriate academic course in law;



(b) undertake   a   vocational   course  which includes

advocacy training;



(c) undertake practical training in advocacy;



(d) obtain a limited certificate; and then



(e) practise with a limited certificate for a certain

period.



Progression to each stage should depend on a

satisfactory completion of the previous one and an

assurance that work is being completed to a

satisfactory standard.



5.16 The  Government  envisages  that  advocacy certificates

would   be   issued   and,   where   appropriate, varied,

suspended   or   revoked   by   the   relevant supervisory

professional bodies.    The Lord Chancellor would decide,

on   advice   from  the  Advisory  Committee,   and after

consulting  the  judiciary,   which  professional bodies

should be  authorised  to  grant  advocacy certificates.

The   Advisory   Committee   would   be   expected   to be

satisfied,   before  recommending  that  any professional

body  should  be   so  authorised,   that   that   body had

adequate  arrangements  in operation  both  to  ensure a

practitioner&apos;s   competence   and   to   monitor his

performance  as  a  practising  advocate.   The Government

suggests  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest  that a

variety of professional bodies should be so authorised.



7


CONFIDENTIAL



Requirements for obtaining an advocacy certificate

academic course in law



This is discussed in Chapter 3 and Annex C.



Vocational course



5.17 The basic advocacy course should include both

theoretical and practical instruction in how to present

a case. This practical instruction should be under the

supervision of practising advocates and should take the

form of demonstrations and role-playing exercises. The

student would not attend court except as an observer

during this stage of training.



Practical training



5.18 This stage of training would need to be undertaken by

all   student  advocates  wishing  to  acquire  a limited

advocacy certificate. The purpose of the training would

be   to   introduce   students   to   the  world   of actual

practice   and   to   enable   them   to   gain first-hand

experience  of   seeing  how  advocacy  is  conducted by

practitioners in court. Students would each be required

to be attached throughout this stage of training to an

experienced  advocate  who  would  be   responsible for

teaching   the   student   the   tools   of   the   trade and

monitoring his or her progress. Students should have to

keep log books in which they would record details of

their  training,   which would  be  authenticated  by the

experienced  practitioner  to whom  they  are attached.

Practitioners  willing  to  take  students  ought  to be

certified as qualified to do so by their professional

body. The length and method of this practical training

and   the   criteria   appropriate   for identifying

practitioners qualified to take students are matters on

which the Advisory Committee will be invited to make

proposals.   The  Government  would  nevertheless welcome



8


CONFIDENTIAL



views now on how these suggestions could be given

practical effect.



5.19 The Government envisages that the practical stage of

training is unlikely to last for less than six months.

The Advisory Committee would need to suggest what

proportion of this period should consist of actual

experience of what happens in court. This experience

would be gained by watching, taking notes of evidence

and general assistance to the practitioner to whom the

student is attached. The student would not have

rights of audience in court at this stage, although it

might be appropriate to encourage him or her to appear

as a lay person in tribunals or in small claims cases

in the County Courts. Students should be able to show,

perhaps through their log books, that they have

attended court for a minimum period with the

practitioner to whom they are attached or with other

suitable practitioners in each of the categories of

case relevant to the particular certificate they are

seeking.



5.20 The   Government   suggests   that   there   should   be three

types of limited advocacy certificate:



(a) general, covering both criminal and civil work;



(b) criminal only; and



(c) civil only.



The majority of students would probably wish to seek a

general certificate, but there would be some (for

example, any who had already decided they wanted to

follow a career in the Crown Prosecution Service) who

would wish to seek only a criminal or, as the case

might be, a civil certificate.



5.21 This would mean that those students wishing to acquire

a  limited general  advocacy certificate would need to



9


CONFIDENTIAL



show that they had attended both criminal and civil

cases for a minimum period. Those students wishing to

acquire only limited criminal advocacy certificates

would need to show only that they had attended criminal

cases for a minimum period and those students wishing

to acquire only limited civil advocacy certificates

would need to show only that they had attended civil

cases for a minimum period. In view of the kind of

practice that it is envisaged would be allowed to a

student after he or she had acquired a limited advocacy

certificate (see paras 5.24-5.26 below), the student

should be able to show that his or her court experience

at this stage had included significant experience in

the lower courts.



5.22 After a student had gained some general experience of

practice the Advisory Committee might wish to consider

obliging him or her to undertake a further short taught

course in advocacy at this stage in order to

consolidate what he or she learned at the vocational

stage and experienced during his or her practical

training.



5.23 On satisfactory completion of the practical stage of

training, which should be confirmed by the production

of a certificate signed by the supervising advocate,

the relevant professional body would issue the student

with a limited advocacy certificate which would be

either general, covering both criminal and civil work,

or restricted to either criminal or civil work.



Advocacy with a limited certificate



5.24 Those holding a limited advocacy certificate could be

granted rights of audience in the courts listed in

para 5.26. The Advisory Committee would be expected to

advise on this  in due course.     Those with a limited



10


CONFIDENTIAL



general certificate would have rights of audience in

all the courts listed; those with a limited criminal

or civil certificate would have rights of audience only

in criminal or civil cases, as the case might be.



5.25 It should be for consideration whether any particular



proceedings concerning children, such as care, wardship

and adoption, should be excluded from the scope of a

limited advocacy certificate.



5.25 Subject  to  this  point,   the  courts  proposed  are as



follows:



(a) the Magistrates&apos; Courts - all proceedings;



(b) Coroners&apos; Courts;



(c) the County Courts - all proceedings;



(d) the   Crown  Court   -   all   proceedings   except jury

trials; and



(e) the High Court -



(i) formal and unopposed proceedings; and



(ii) proceedings in chambers.



5.27 For some advocates a limited advocacy certificate may

be sufficient for the needs of their practice. For

such advocates a full certificate will be unnecessary.



advocacy with a full certificate



5.28 A full certificate would allow an advocate rights of

audience in all courts in England and Wales either in

all cases or else in only criminal or civil cases, as

the case might be.



5.29 It will be for consideration by the Advisory Committee

whether a short formal taught course at the end of the

limited certificate period would be a useful

requirement before a full advocacy certificate could be

obtained.      The  contents   of   any  such  course would



11


CONFIDENTIAL



obviously depend on the type of full certificate

sought, but such a course could for instance cover jury

trials and the differences in procedure between the

County Court and the High Court.



Full general certificate



5.30 To obtain a full general certificate an advocate would

need to have held a limited certificate for a minimum

period and within a set period of time to have

completed a prescribed minimum amount of actual

advocacy in the Magistrates&apos; Courts, the County Courts

and the Crown Court.



Full criminal certificate



5.31 Similarly, to obtain a full criminal certificate an

advocate would need to have held a limited certificate

for a minimum period and within a set period of time to

have completed a prescribed minimum amount of actual

advocacy in the Magistrates&apos; Courts and the Crown

Court.



Full civil certificate



5.32 Again, to obtain a full civil certificate an advocate

would need to have held a limited certificate for a

minimum period and within a set period of time to have

completed a prescribed minimum amount of actual

advocacy in the County Courts.



5.33 These time limits and the minimum amount of actual

advocacy will be matters for consideration by the

Advisory Committee, but they should recognise that the

best test of competence in advocacy is an advocate&apos; s

ability to earn a living by pleading in the courts.



Amendments to legislation and practice rules



12


CONFIDENTIAL



5.34 A re-organisation of  rights of audience on the lines



suggested above would require amendment of both

statutory provisions and rules of court. The Bar and

the Law Society would doubtless also wish to amend

their professional practice rules.



Transitional arrangements



5.35 The principle underlying the transitional arrangements



should be that individual practitioners who already

have rights of audience before the various particular

courts, when the new arrangements come into force,

should retain those rights. The new arrangements would

be intended to apply only to those who qualified after

the new arrangements come into operation. In addition,

therefore, transitional arrangements would need to be

made to ensure that those who can demonstrate that they

already have long experience in a particular field of

advocacy and who are currently practising in that

field, but who may not be able to fulfil any new

educational requirements for rights of audience, will

nevertheless be able to obtain the appropriate rights

of audience. This would be particularly likely to apply

to solicitors who can show that they already have

sufficient experience of practising advocacy in the

relevant courts.



Transitional arrangements for barristers



5.36 All barristers who had completed their pupillages, when



the new arrangements were introduced, would be granted

full general advocacy certificates. Students called to

the Bar or completing pupillage after the introduction

of the new arrangements would be required to obtain the

proposed advocacy certificates.



Transitional arrangements for solicitors



13


CONFIDENTIAL



5.37 All   solicitors   in  private   practice,   when   the new



arrangements were introduced, would be granted limited

general advocacy certificates. Obtaining a full

certificate thereafter would depend on whether a

solicitor could demonstrate that he or she had

satisfied the necessary conditions. The Advisory

Committee would be asked to advise as an early priority

what this should entail. As with barristers, students

completing articles after the new arrangements were

introduced would be required to obtain the necessary

advocacy certificates.



Transitional arrangements for employed lawyers



5.38 Employed lawyers would be granted limited general

advocacy certificates when the new arrangements came

into force. An employed lawyer would need to

demonstrate that he or she had satisfied the

requirements for a full general advocacy certificate,

in order to obtain one of these. The Advisory Committee

would be asked to advise as an early priority what this

should entail. Any employed barrister who had not done

pupillage should for this purpose also have to show

that he or she had met the requirements of the proposed

new practical training, although this could be done

under the supervision of a suitably qualified lawyer

employed in the same organisation. Procedures for

dealing with potential conflicts of interest would, of

course, need to be in place before these changes could

be made, as would arrangements to ensure the

independence of lawyers having the conduct of

prosecutions from those involved in the investigative

process.



Transitional arrangements for others



5.39 All those who already had limited rights of audience

when the new arrangements were introduced (see Annex  



14


CONFIDENTIAL



for examples) would be entitled to retain these. The

Advisory Committee would be asked to advise as an early

priority on the appropriate continuing arrangements for

granting advocacy certificates to practitioners of

these kinds after the new arrangements come into force.



Consultation



5.40 The Government would welcome views on the proposals for



rights of audience set out above.



15


CONFIDENTIAL

CHAPTER 6 - IMMUNITY FROM ACTIONS

IN NEGLIGENCE IN ADVOCACY WORK



Recent cases have established that an advocate, whether

barrister or solicitor, is immune from an action for

negligence at the suit of his or her client in respect

of his or her conduct and management of a case in

court. This immunity extends to the preliminary work

connected with the hearing such as the drawing of

pleadings and to pre-trial work where the act in

question is intimately connected with the conduct of

the case in court.



The main reasons for this immunity are that the

administration of justice requires barristers and

solicitors to be able to carry out their duty to the

court fearlessly and independently and that actions for

negligence against barristers and solicitors in

respect of advocacy work would make the re-trying of

the original actions inevitable and so multiply

litigation. The Government accepts the cogency of

these arguments and considers that this immunity from

actions in negligence should in the future extend to

all recognised advocates.


CONFIDENTIAL



CHAPTER 7 - ATTENDANCE ON COUNSEL



7.1 At present, except in proceedings in the Magistrates&apos;

Court, counsel is virtually always attended by a

solicitor or their representative. The Code of Conduct

of the Bar allows a barrister to appear unattended in

any case in the Crown Court provided that he or she is

satisfied that the interests of the lay client and the

interests of justice will not be prejudiced. The Law

Society&apos;s Practice Rules are less relaxed about

allowing solicitors not to accompany barristers to

court.



7.2 The criticism frequently levelled at a requirement for

counsel to be attended in court is that it produces

unnecessary double manning and therefore increased cost

to the client. It must therefore be considered whether

the requirement for a solicitor to attend on counsel

or, in the light of the proposals outlined in

Chapter 5, to attend on any advocate, can be justified.



7.3 The Government considers that the need for an advocate

to be attended in court depends on the circumstances.

In some cases attendance may be superfluous, but in

others it may genuinely be difficult for an advocate

to handle both the advocacy and the ancillary matters

without assistance. In such cases it may well be an

efficient and cost-effective use of time for an

advocate to be attended.



7.4 Accordingly, the Government considers that those who

are paying for in-court work should be allowed to

decide whether assistance in court is required. Any

specific requirement, however, in professional practice

rules that an advocate must be attended would appear to

be unjustifiable.


CONFIDENTIAL

CHAPTER 8 - DIRECT ACCESS TO COUNSEL



8.1 Two separate, but related, Issues are considered in

this chapter: the question of contractual relationships

between counsel and those who instruct them and the

question of who can instruct counsel.



Contractual relations



8.2 It has long been established by case law that there is

no contractual relationship between barristers and

those who instruct them. A barrister therefore has to

recover his or her fees by other means. One way of

doing this is an arrangement such as the Bar has with

the Law Society whose rules provide that, except in

legal aid cases, a solicitor is personally liable as a

matter of professional conduct for the payment of

counsel&apos;s proper fees, whether or not he or she has

been put in funds by the client.



8.3 The Government considers that these arrangements are

anachronistic. The Government notes that the Bar has

not thought it appropriate to adopt this approach to

practice overseas and that the Overseas Practice Rules

of the Bar (see Chapter 11 para 11.24) allow a

barrister to negotiate fees directly with non-UK

clients for non-UK work and to enforce payment. The

Government accordingly proposes that there should be

legislation to permit barristers who wish to do so to

enter into contractual relations with those who

instruct them in respect of UK work.



Direct access



8.4 The further question for consideration is who those

instructing parties should be. At present, in

accordance with the professional rules of conduct set

out   in  the  Bar&apos;s  Code  of  Conduct,   a  barrister may



1


CONFIDENTIAL



accept instructions only from solicitors or, in some

circumstances, from parliamentary agents, patent

agents, trade mark agents, London notaries, licensed

conveyancers, the Government legal service, the legal

departments of local or public authorities and employed

barristers. The Bar has announced recently that it

intends to allow direct access from other professions

such as accountants in early 1989 although direct

access from the lay public continues to be prohibited.

In addition, it is to be noted that the Overseas

Practice Rules of the Bar provide that a barrister

may: -



(a) accept instructions from a foreign lawyer for non-

UK work;



(b) accept   instructions   from  any  UK  lay  client for

non-UK litigation or arbitration; and



(c) accept instructions from a non-UK lay client for

non-UK work.



8.5 For many,   if not most,  barristers,     the major part of



their practice seems likely, notwithstanding the

proposals elsewhere in this Green Paper, to continue

to be advocacy and the preparation of cases for court.

Advocacy is a skill which requires regular and frequent

practice if high standards of performance are to be

developed and maintained. Indeed advocates, who under

the present arrangements depend for their livelihood

upon the continuing approval of solicitors, who are

their independent professional clients, find that it is

only in this way that they can maintain a successful

practice as advocates. Advocates may therefore wish to

choose to accept instructions only from other

professionals who have the expertise to identify the

issues and sift out the relevant facts for them; and to

concentrate  themselves  on  maintaining  their practice



2


CONFIDENTIAL



and performance as advocates. Moreover, the majority of

solicitors, particularly those who practise in small

firms or in areas distant from any major court centre,

are likely to continue to find that it suits the nature

of their business not to practise regularly as

advocates themselves, but rather, as they do now with

much County Court and Magistrates&apos; Court work, to

instruct those whose full-time occupation is advocacy

to take their in-court work for them.



At  present  the Government  thinks  that  in the future

advocates   should  themselves  have  the  discretion to

decide,  in the light of the nature of their practice,

whether  they wish  to  take  instructions  directly from

lay   clients   or   to   restrict   themselves   to taking

instructions  only  from other professionals. Moreover,

in   order   to   promote   the   use   of   their services,

advocates who choose only to take instructions through

other  professionals,   should  be  entitled,   if  they so

wish,   to  belong  to  a  voluntary  association,   one of

whose  characteristics  might  be  that  its  members take

instructions only in this way, although they would need

to   be   able   to   demonstrate   in   due   course   to the

competition authority that this was not operating in an

anti-competitive way.   They could also advertise their

membership of such an association to those instructing

professionals,   such as  solicitors,   who are  likely to

want  to  continue  to  use  their  services.   The prime

examples of such bodies are currently the four Inns of

Court,  who compete with each other by means of their

scholarships, libraries and other collegiate facilities

to  attract  new  entrants  to  the  profession  to their

membership. Other examples might in the future develop

on  the  lines  of  one  or  more  of  the  specialist Bar

Associations.


CONFIDENTIAL



8.7 There   is,   however,   an  argument   sometimes advanced,

which is set out in this paragraph,   that to grant to

advocates, who practise in the higher courts, the right

to have direct access to the lay client might lead to

fundamental   changes   in  the  structure  of  the legal

profession,  which would reduce the extent of informed

choice currently available to the lay client through

his   solicitor;   and   would   lower   the   standards of

advocacy to which the courts have become accustomed.

This argument is that, whereas there are currently some

50,000   solicitors   who   have   available   to   them the

specialist   services,   both   in   advocacy   and other

specialisms,   of some 5,500 members of the independent

Bar,   the  right  to direct  access  might  lead more and

more   advocates   to   attach   themselves,   as &quot;trial

lawyers&quot;,  to firms of solicitors,  or to set themselves

up as advocates taking their clients direct  from the

public.   The  result,   it  is  said,   could be  that there

might   be   a   serious   contraction   of   the   corps of

independent advocates available to all solicitors, and

an increasing practice amongst lawyers of all kinds to

choose their own in-house specialist or trial lawyer in

preference to the independent specialist best suited to

the needs of the particular case.   If this happened to

any serious extent,  the result,  it is suggested, could

be   that   the  choice  of   advocates   available   to all

clients would be substantially reduced.



8.8 The Government, however, hopes and expects that a free

market for the provision of independent advocacy

services will flourish. Certainly the extent and

variety of the present demand for advocacy leads the

Government to believe that this will be so. Empirical

evidence from other common law jurisdictions and the

present success of English barristers in obtaining work

abroad,   especially in Europe,   suggest that specialist



4


CONFIDENTIAL



advocates who act only as such and do not become

involved in pre-advocacy case work are well able to

flourish in the market place in direct and open

competition with other lawyers who do not act

exclusively as advocates.



Consultation



8.9 The Government would welcome comment on the principles



set out in this chapter; and on whether its views, and

its proposals in the light of English barristers&apos;

experience in other common law jurisdictions and in

Europe, meet the criteria endorsed in Chapter 1.

CONFIDENTIAL

CHAPTER 9 - QUEEN&apos;S COUNSEL



9.1 Barristers have historically been divided into junior

Counsel and Queen&apos;s (or King&apos;s) Counsel. The first

King&apos;s Counsel were appointed by the Crown at the end

of the sixteenth century in order to assist the law

officers of the Crown. By the eighteenth century

appointment had come to be regarded as a mark of pre-

eminence in the profession. Today Queen&apos;s Counsel

comprise about 10 per cent of the practising Bar.



9.2 Queen&apos;s Counsel (&quot;QCs&quot; or &quot;Silks&quot;) are appointed by the

Queen on the advice of the Lord Chancellor.

Practitioners who wish to be considered for appointment

are invited to submit their names to the Lord

Chancellor. Following wide consultation with the

judiciary and the profession, the Lord Chancellor then

settles the list of names to be recommended to the

Queen.



9.3 In the past the Bar had a rule that a QC could appear

in Court only if a junior also were instructed. That

rule has now gone. A QC may, however, decline to appear

without a junior, if he considers that the interests of

the client require that a junior also should be

instructed. He may also decline instructions to advise

or draft a non-contentious document without a junior,

if he considers that the interests of the client

require that a junior also should be instructed.



9.4 Critics of the system say that it is inflationary

because QCs&apos; charges are unnecessarily high, and

because juniors are still unnecessarily instructed. It

has therefore been suggested in some quarters that the

system no longer serves any useful purpose, and that it

should be abolished.



1


CONFIDENTIAL



9.5 Against that, the Government considers that the

retention of a two-tier system of advocates is

justified. Appointment to the rank of QC is made only

after very wide consultation by the Lord Chancellor.

It thereby:-



(a) enables both lawyers and clients to identify the

leading members of the profession, and thus to

exercise a more informed choice about the

competence of the advocates whom they are choosing

than they would otherwise have been able to do;



(b) acts as an incentive for advocates to strive to

achieve and maintain excellent standards; and



(c) helps the Lord Chancellor to identify at an early

stage those who are likely in due course to be

candidates for the High Court Bench, and for other

forms of public service such as inquiries into

disasters.



9.6 The Government considers, in the light of the proposals

in Chapter 5 on rights of audience, that in future all

who hold full general advocacy certificates, whether

or not they are barristers, should be treated as

eligible for appointment as Queen&apos;s Counsel. The

present practice whereby Silk is occasionally given,

normally on an honorary basis, to people who are not

practising advocates, for example distinguished

academics, also need not be disturbed, although such

honorary appointments need not in future be restricted

to those who happen originally to have qualified as

barristers. Appointment to Silk is not controlled by

statute, so no legislation would be required to achieve

this.



2


CONFIDENTIAL



9.7 In  the  Government&apos;s  view,   however,   any professional



practice rules about access to or representation by

Silks or about the relative size of payments to Silks

and other lawyers appear to be difficult to justify.

This will be a matter for the proposed new competition

authority.



Summary



9.8 The Government proposes that in future those treated as



eligible for Silk should be:-



(a) all those who hold full general advocacy certificates;

and



(b) on an occasional and honorary basis, lawyers who are

not practising advocates, whether or not such lawyers

are barristers.

CHAPTER 10 ? THE JUDICIARY



Summary



10.1 The Government proposes that all advocates who have

held the relevant advocacy certificates for the

appropriate length of time should in future be eligible

for judicial appointment; and in addition that judges

in a lower court should be eligible for promotion to a

higher one on the basis of their judicial experience in

the lower court.



Basis of judicial appointments



10.2 A strong and independent judiciary is one of the

central supports upon which our liberties are based and

upon which the rule of law depends. Moreover, our

adversarial method of administering justice requires

the judges at least at trial courts to be recruited on

the whole from among seasoned advocates. It is,

therefore, important that the ablest practitioners

should have in their sights some aspiration towards

judicial work at the end of their careers in

professional practice. No one should be excluded, by

virtue of the fact of choosing one branch of the

profession rather than another, from reaching the

highest judicial office. Over time, the increased

competition will enable the Lord Chancellor more easily

to maintain the highest standard of appointments. The

Government therefore proposes that, in future, all

those who have held an advocacy certificate for an

appropriate minimum period for the courts covered by

any particular judicial office should be eligible for

appointment to that office. As now, legal eligibility

will not of course guarantee appointment. In

particular, the Lord Chancellor sees no reason to

change the now well-established policy of requiring

satisfactory part-time judicial service as a condition

of full-time judicial appointment.


CONFIDENTIAL



(A)   House of Lords



10.3 The Appellate  Jurisdiction Act 1876  provides  that the



qualification for appointment as a Lord of Appeal in

Ordinary is that the individual:-



(a) has for at least two years held the office of Lord

Chancellor or of Judge in one of Her Majesty&apos;s Superior

Courts in Great Britain and Northern Ireland; or



(b) has been for not less than 15 years a practising

barrister in England and Wales or Northern Ireland or a

practising advocate in Scotland.



Although the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary are usually

appointed from among the judges of the superior courts,

the Government proposes to amend (b) above to remove

the reference to a practising barrister and to refer

instead to anyone who has held a full general advocacy

certificate for at least 15 years. The Scottish

position will be considered separately.



(B)   Supreme Court and Circuit Judges



10.4 Under  the  present   legislation  some  senior judicial



offices are not open to solicitors; others, although

open to solicitors, impose upon them criteria for

eligibility which do not apply in relation to

barristers. Solicitors are not eligible for appointment

as Lords Justices of Appeal, Heads of Division, High

Court Judges or Deputy High Court Judges. Although

solicitors can now be appointed as Circuit Judges, they

are required, unlike barristers, to have served for a

period of at least three years as Recorders before

appointment. Section 9(1) of the Supreme Court

Act 1981 does, however, provide that the Lord

Chancellor  may  request  a  Circuit  Judge  to  sit  as a



2


CONFIDENTIAL



judge of the High Court, so that solicitor Circuit

Judges may by this means be requested to sit as High

Court Judges from time to time.



(a)   Judicial promotions



10.5 At the time of the Parliamentary passage of the Supreme

Court Act 1981, an attempt was made to amend the

provisions of the Bill so as to provide that any

Circuit Judge could be eligible for appointment to the

High Court. This would have meant that solicitors

could, by that route, have reached the High Court. This

move was resisted at the time, substantially on the

basis that it was considered that only practice as an

advocate in the High Court equipped anyone to sit

judicially in that forum. Because solicitors did not

have a right of audience in the High Court, they could,

therefore, it was argued, never acquire the relevant

experience.



10.6 It is doubtful whether the arguments which were

successful in 1981 still carry conviction. A

successful career as an advocate in the High Court is

an excellent way of training an individual to sit

judicially in that court, but it does not necessarily

follow that advocacy and advocacy alone in the higher

courts should be the only route to a judicial career in

these courts. Judicial experience seems an equally

acceptable qualification; and it seems today an

unjustifiable constraint that a solicitor Circuit

Judge, whatever his or her merits, can never be

promoted to the High Court. If the law were changed to

permit the Lord Chancellor to recommend the promotion

of solicitor Circuit Judges to the High Court, there

would, of course, be no obligation on him to do so. He

would continue, as now, to choose the best available

candidate for each individual post,  but the pool from



3


CONFIDENTIAL



which he could make that choice would be beneficially

enlarged.



(b) Direct appointments



10.7 What is now recommended for the development of the

profession (see Chapter 5) will in due course create a

class of advocates in the superior courts who may be

either barristers or solicitors or lawyers who are

neither. A wider question therefore arises whether it

can be right to limit eligibility to direct appointment

to judicial office in these courts to one side of the

profession or the other. It does not appear to be

logical to do so. Rather, eligibility for appointment

to the Supreme Court and Circuit Bench should be

determined by reference to whether any individual

practitioner has had the necessary experience as an

advocate in the relevant court.



(c) The Government&apos;s proposals



10.8 (i)    The   Government   therefore   proposes   that there



should in future be two ways to establish

eligibility for a Supreme Court appointment. The

first would be by having held a full general

advocacy certificate for a minimum period,

probably 10 years; and the second would be by

having held office as a Circuit Judge for a

minimum period, perhaps 2 years. All those who

had held a full general advocacy certificate for

the minimum period should be eligible also to act

as Deputy High Court Judges.



(ii) All those who had held a full general advocacy

certificate, or at least either a full criminal

and a limited civil or a full civil and a limited

criminal advocacy certificate, for a minimum

period,  probably 10 years,  should be eligible for



4


CONFIDENTIAL



appointment to the Circuit Bench. In addition, a

Master or Registrar or equivalent judicial officer

who had held office for a minimum period, perhaps

2 years, should be eligible for appointment as a

Circuit Judge. The present requirement that

solicitors must serve as Recorders for a minimum

of 3 years before appointment to the Circuit

Bench should be removed. The criteria for

appointment as a Recorder or Assistant Recorder

should be changed in line with those for

appointment as a Circuit Judge.



(C)   Masters and Registrars



10.9 Only solicitors of at least 7 years&apos; standing are at

present qualified for appointment as County Court

Registrars (section 9 of the County Courts Act 1984).

The Civil Justice Review recommended that barristers

also should be eligible for appointment as County Court

Registrars (rec 14); and there has been no subsequent

objection to this proposal. In addition, since the

Supreme Court Act 1981 both solicitors and barristers

have been eligible for appointment as Masters and

Registrars in all branches of the High Court.



10.10 The Government now proposes, in line with its general

approach to the judiciary, that in future any person

who has held at least a limited civil advocacy

certificate for a minimum period, probably 7 years,

should be eligible for appointment as a High Court

Master or Registrar or as a County Court Registrar.

Obviously advocates who had held full civil or full or

limited general certificates for an equivalent minimum

period also would be eligible for appointment. These

eligibility conditions would be applied also to part-

time  appointments,   since  a  number  of  advocates might



5


CONFIDENTIAL



wish to practise part-time as advocates and to sit

part-time as Registrars.



(D)   Other appointments



10.11 This chapter has discussed only the main judicial

appointments at each level. There are also various

other judicial appointments, particularly at the lower

levels, where the eligibility provisions will need to

be amended in line with the approach set out in this

chapter.



Transitional arrangements



10.12 The following transitional arrangements seem

appropriate:-



(a) Barristers



All barristers who had been called when the new

arrangements came into force, would be eligible

for all appointments for which they are at present

eligible, provided they were of or achieved the

standing required by the present law. In addition

they would become eligible for appointment as

County Court Registrars, again provided they were

of or achieved the required number of years

standing.



(b) Solicitors



All solicitors who were on the roll when the new

arrangements came into force would be eligible for

all appointments provided:-



(i) in the case of appointments to the House



of Lords and the Supreme Court, they

were of or achieved the standing now

required for barristers and acquired the

necessary full advocacy certificate;



6


CONFIDENTIAL



( )



in the case of appointments to the

Circuit Bench, they were of or achieved

10 years&apos; standing; and



(iii)



in the case of appointments as Masters

and Registrars, they were of or achieved

7 years&apos; standing.



Conclusion



10.13



(a)



(b)



(c)

(d)



In conclusion, therefore, it is proposed that:



any person who has held a full general advocacy

certificate for at least 15 years should be eligible

for appointment as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary (the

existing provision for the appointment of serving

judges would remain);



any person who has held a full general advocacy

certificate for at least 10 years or has been a Circuit

Judge for at least 2 years should be eligible for

appointment to the Supreme Court;



any person who has held a full general advocacy

certificate for at least 10 years should be eligible to

act as a Deputy High Court judge;



any person who has held a full general advocacy

certificate, or at least either a full criminal and a

limited civil or a full civil and a limited criminal

advocacy certificate, for at least 10 years should be

eligible for appointment to the Circuit Bench;



any person who has been a Master or Registrar or an

equivalent   judicial   officer   for   at   least   2 years



7


CONFIDENTIAL



should be eligible for appointment to the Circuit

Bench;



(f) the provision whereby a solicitor must serve for a

minimum of 3 years as a Recorder before becoming

eligible for appointment to the Circuit Bench should be

removed;



(g) the criteria for appointment as a Recorder or Assistant

Recorder should be changed in line with those for a

Circuit Judge; and



(h) any person who has held at least a limited civil

advocacy certificate for at least 7 years should be

eligible for appointment as a High Court Master or

Registrar or as a County Court Registrar.

CHAPTER 11 - BARRISTERS&apos; PRACTICES



Introduction



11.1 The  internal  rules  and  methods  of  organisation which



govern barristers&apos; practices are a matter for the Bar,

although it will need to be able to justify these to

the new competition authority which it is envisaged

will be set up in accordance with the Government&apos;s

proposals set out in the consultation paper &quot;Review of

Restrictive Trade Practices&quot; which was published by the

Department of Trade and Industry in March 1988. The

purpose of this chapter is to examine existing

arrangements for barristers&apos; practices in the context

of the criteria of quality of service, efficiency, and

competition set out in Chapter 1 of this paper, and

against the background of the need to protect the

interests of clients. As a starting point for that

examination, this chapter sets out a number of areas in

which the existing arrangements for barristers&apos;

practices might benefit from closer scrutiny.



Main areas of concern



11.2 Every barrister who wishes to set up in practice must



first go through a period of pupillage.    He must then:-



(a) become a member of chambers i.e. obtain a tenancy;



(b) practise only as an individual; and



(c) have the services of a clerk.



11.3 These   special   requirements   of   the   Bar   have been



criticised on the grounds, first, that it is often very

difficult for new barristers to get themselves into a

position where they may set up in practice, and,

secondly, that the practice requirements are themselves

unnecessarily restrictive.



Pupillages



1


CONFIDENTIAL



11.4 The Bar has a policy that anyone who wishes to enter

pupillage should be allowed to do so. The present

system of pupillage allocations, however, has been

criticised as un-satisfactory, on the grounds that it

operates haphazardly and unfairly, particularly to the

disadvantage of minority groups. Although some

chambers already advertise for pupils, the Bar, in

response to these criticisms, is at present considering

the establishment of a central information base from

which prospective pupils and tenants may find out

easily what and where vacancies exist. It is also

considering a register of approved pupil masters and a

wider range of pupillages, which take more account of

the needs of central and local Government, commerce

and the EC.



11.5 The Government expects the Bar to ensure that

pupillages are allocated in the most efficient and fair

way possible.



Tenancies



11.6 Even greater difficulties can be experienced by those

who wish to set up in practice, since this entails

obtaining a tenancy in chambers. Although no reliable

figures are available, it seems that only between 50%

and 65% of those completing pupillage obtain a tenancy.

Even though not every new barrister wishes to set up in

independent practice, this still gives cause for

concern. Moreover it cannot be assumed that those who

do at present obtain tenancies are on the whole the

best barristers, since it still appears to be difficult

for a barrister to obtain a tenancy in a set where he

has not obtained pupillage. The successful pupil in

one set may not be as good as an unsuccessful pupil in

another set.



2


CONFIDENTIAL



11.7 The Government expects the Bar to introduce a more

competitive system, covering all chambers, which will

result in tenancies being granted on a more open and

fair basis in all cases.



Chambers



11.8 The underlying cause of difficulty arises from the

present rule that a barrister must practise from

approved chambers, coupled with the shortage of

accommodation in the Inns of Court, which is where the

overwhelming majority of barristers in London choose to

practise. It is absurd that entry to a profession

depends on whether a person can obtain accommodation.



11.9 There is in fact no requirement that a barrister should

practise from any particular place, but a barrister who

wishes to open chambers in central London, otherwise

than in premises owned or managed by the Inns, must

apply to the Bar Council for consent. A barrister who

wishes to open a set of chambers on Circuit must apply

to the Circuit for permission. The criteria used by

the Bar when it considers applications include the

suitability of the applicant, of the clerk and of the

premises and their location. It is, however, expressly

provided that lack of need cannot be a valid ground for

refusal, presumably so that leave cannot be refused

because of a fear of possible competition.



11.10 The Government believes that the present requirements

that a barrister must practise from approved chambers

and that consent must be obtained from the Bar before

chambers are opened outside the Inns are unnecessarily

restrictive and not needed to protect either the

barrister or the client. There is no obvious reason

why barristers ought not to be allowed to practise

where they choose.



3


CONFIDENTIAL



11.11 The Government accepts that most barristers may

continue to prefer to set up in chambers. As a

consequence, any improvement to the present

accommodation problem will largely depend on members of

the Bar in London being more ready to set up chambers

outside the Inns. Although there was once a financial

advantage in having chambers in the Inns, because rents

were lower than rents outside, this is less so now

because the Inns are increasingly charging market

rents. Some sets do, however, appear to prefer to

remain in cramped accommodation for reasons other than

the costs of accommodation outside. Proximity to other

barristers, to the Inns&apos; facilities and to the Courts

are cited as factors. There are also those who are

anxious that solicitors will not instruct them if they

are in practice outside the Inns, because lay clients

will not regard them as sufficiently prestigious.



11.12 There are already sets of chambers which have set up

and survived outside the Inns. Indeed it is probably

not necessary to go far away to find suitable

accommodation. In any case, the traditional wish to be

near the Royal Courts of Justice, because of the

convenience of easy physical access, will be of less

significance with the continuing development of

information technology. The Government is also aware

that the Inns themselves are now beginning to tackle

the problem. In June 1987 the Inns Council resolved

that the Inns should as far as possible, and in co-

operation with one another, provide sufficient

accommodation whether within or if necessary outside

the precincts of the Inns of Court to house the

practising Bar in London. In May 1988 the Vice-

Chairman of the Inns Accommodation Committee invited

those Chambers prepared to move out to let him know.



4


CONFIDENTIAL



The Government welcomes this approach but suggests that

it should be made in a more positive manner. The

Government considers that the profession should take

active steps to find suitable accommodation for

barristers outside the Inns.



Partnerships



11.13 Barristers are not permitted to practise in

partnership. A set of chambers therefore consists of a

number of sole practitioners practising within the same

premises. The Head of Chambers is required to ensure

that the chambers function properly. In recent years

there has been an increasing tendency for sets to

establish committees of barristers responsible for

matters such as pupillage, recruitment and management.

There are now also often chambers meetings of all

members. In addition the Bar now permits fee-sharing

agreements. It may be wondered why the Bar does not

simply permit partnerships.



11.14 This is a question which has often been considered by

the Bar over the years. The principal argument by

those against appears to be that it would severely

restrict client freedom of choice because one partner

may not act for a client if his partner acts for an

opposing client. This is a consequence of section 5 of

the Partnership Act 1890, which makes one partner

responsible for the acts and defaults of the other

partner. If partners acted for opposing sides in a

case they would therefore be subject to a conflict of

interest. It would also be wrong for partners to have

a financial interest in both sides of a case. The same

considerations prevent different members of the same

firm of solicitors from acting for opposite sides in a

case. The Government would welcome comment on whether

these  problems  are  insurmountable;   or whether there



5


CONFIDENTIAL



might be ways to meet the point about conflict of

interest, which would enable partners to act for

opposing sides in a case.



11.15 The Government believes that it ought to be for

individual groups of barristers to decide what is best

for themselves, although it thinks that, particularly

in areas of specialised practice where there are only

very few sets which can offer the necessary expertise,

barristers are very likely to decide for themselves

that partnership is not a practical proposition. In

other areas it may be.



11.16 Partnership could offer barristers some advantages over

their present system.    In particular it could:-



(a) permit increased financial stability for a set of

chambers;



(b) improve   the   financial   position   of   the new

entrant;



(c) encourage proper supervision of work undertaken by

the new entrant; and



(d) ensure greater office efficiency.



11.17 The Government thinks that barristers should be

permitted to operate in partnerships if they choose to

do so, although it recognises that for many this may

not be a preferred option. The Government believes that

the risk of diminishing clients&apos; choice, whether in

specialist fields of law or in the smaller circuits

outside London, is outweighed by the advantages of

greater efficiency and of easing the entry of new

barristers into the profession. Any risk of diminution



6


CONFIDENTIAL



of clients&apos; choice will be met by the fact that the

forces of competition can be expected to fill

naturally any gaps in the provision of advocacy

services.



Incorpora t ion



11.18 Since some chambers have already formed companies for

the ownership of common assets, the Government thinks

barristers should probably also be permitted to operate

in corporate form if they so choose, although this

should not affect the personal responsibility of

individual practitioners for their client&apos;s cases.

Safeguards would be needed to ensure that clients

remained adequately financially protected, if

barristers wanted to form limited liability companies.



Employment of others



11.19 There also seems to be no reason why barristers should

not be able to employ others to assist them with their

legal work, including other barristers (subject to

rules about conflicts of interest).



Clerks



11.20 The functions of a barrister&apos;s clerk have been

described as:-



(a) office administrator and accountant;



(b) business manager; and



(c) agent.



11.21 His role in a barrister&apos;s life is a powerful one

because of the rule that every barrister must have a

clerk and because of a further rule that the solicitor

must normally negotiate with the clerk rather than the



7


CONFIDENTIAL



barrister about fees. In addition the organisation of

members of chambers as a collection of individuals

rather than a partnership may impede their collective

control over their clerk.



11.22 Clerks have been criticised as having too much

influence over the careers of members of chambers and

as earning too much because traditionally they have

been paid entirely by commission out of the barristers&apos;

fees. These features may today already be diminishing.

As indicated above, chambers management is increasingly

coming under the control of committees; and clerks are

tending more and more to receive salaries plus either

incentives to reward results or smaller commissions.



11.23 Of more significance are the professional rules that

every barrister must have a clerk and that he should

normally negotiate the barrister&apos;s fees. Barristers

will naturally need to have office staff to organise

their practices, but this should be a matter for them

alone to settle. Accordingly the Government agrees

with both Benson and Marre that barristers should not

be compelled to have a clerk. Rather they should be

able to negotiate their own fees, if they so wish.

Moreover, they should simply be under a professional

duty to ensure that their own particular practices are

managed in an efficient and effective manner.



11.24 It should be for individual barristers or chambers to

decide what system of managing their practices is most

suitable for them. It will be of increasing

importance for barristers to be able - as Marre pointed

out - to tailor the organisation of their practices to

meet the demands of the commercial and international

sectors. In particular, the Bar needs to make use of

modern  business  methods   and   information technology.



8


CONFIDENTIAL



The recent report by BDI Binder Hamlyn on chambers

administration, for example, concluded that staff

structures and management techniques in barristers&apos;

chambers were inadequate; and the Government hopes that

the Bar will encourage its members to implement the

recommendations in that report.



Other restrictions



11.25 This chapter has sought only to indicate those areas

of barristers&apos; practices which give particular concern.

The Government hopes that the Bar will examine all

their rules carefully to ensure that they do not impose

unnecessary or unhelpful restrictions. For example it

should also be considered whether:-



(a) the rule that every barrister (other than one

whose chambers are in London) should be a member

of a Circuit or a specialist association serves

any particular purpose; and



(b) the rule that conferences should normally be held

in chambers or in some place other than a

professional client&apos;s office tends to increase

expense rather than protect the integrity of the

barrister.



Overseas practice



11.26 In striking contrast to the rules on practice in

England and Wales, the Bar&apos;s rules on overseas practice

for barristers are much less restrictive. For example,

barristers:-



(a) can accept instructions direct from any UK lay

client for non-U.K. litigation or arbitration, or

from non-U. . lay clients for non-U. . work;



9


CONFIDENTIAL



(b) can negotiate fees directly with these clients and

enforce payment;



(c) can employ outside the U.K. any person who is not

a solicitor practising in England and Wales;



(d) can practise without a clerk; and



(e) can  enter  a  partnership with any other lawyers

except practising U.K. solicitors.



11.27 No doubt this more relaxed approach was prompted by

commercial necessity, but presumably the Bar would not

have made these rules if it thought the professional

integrity of barristers would suffer as a consequence.

It is difficult to see why the position would be

different if the same approach were followed in England

and Wales.



Summary



11.28 The Government considers that the Bar needs to make

changes on the lines mentioned above in order to ensure

that barristers&apos; practising arrangements do not hinder

the provision of legal services to the public in the

most effective, efficient and economical ways. The

areas requiring particular consideration are:-



(a) obtaining pupillages;



(b) obtaining tenancies;



(c) the   requirement   to   practise   as   a   member of

chambers;



(d) the restrictions on partnerships;



(e) the possibility of allowing incorporation; and



(f) the functions of barristers&apos; clerks.

CHAPTER 12 - MULTI-DISCIPLINARY AND MULTI-NATIONAL PRACTICES



(A)   Multi-disciplinary practices

present Position



(a) General



12.1 At present solicitors and barristers are both prevented

by practice rule or code of conduct from practising in

conjunction with members of any other profession. The

Law Society Practice Rules prohibit a solicitor from

sharing fees with an unqualified person (i.e. anyone

not a solicitor). As far as contentious business is

concerned, this prohibition has statutory backing from

the combined effect of section 39 of the Solicitors

Act 1974 and section 5 of the Partnership Act 1890. It

is also arguable that section 22 of the Solicitors Act

has a similar effect in respect of conveyancing

services. Barristers are particularly constrained in

that they are required by the Bar&apos;s Code of Conduct to

practise only as individuals, which thus prevents them,

unlike solicitors, even from practising in partnership

with each other.



(b) Solicitors



12.2 The traditional limitation to sole practice, or

partnership only with other solicitors, of the way in

which solicitors may organise their business reflects

the profession&apos;s concern to maintain the independence

and the role of the solicitor as an officer of the

court, and to avoid conflicts of interest. It has been

argued that such limitation is necessary to preserve:-



(a) the  personal  and  fiduciary  relationship between

solicitor and client;



(b) the  safeguards  afforded  to  clients  by  the high

standards   of   ethics   and   expertise   of the



1


CONFIDENTIAL



profession, supported by its requirements in

respect of professional indemnity insurance,

compensation and accounting for clients&apos; money,

and its provisions for handling complaints and

maintaining professional discipline;



(c) legal   privilege   of   communications between

solicitor and client; and



(d) the proper carrying out of functions reserved by

statute to solicitors.



Supporters of this view are apprehensive that the

maintenance of solicitors&apos; independence and high

standards of conduct might come into conflict with

their duties to colleagues in a multi-disciplinary

practice, since those colleagues would be subject to

the different codes of conduct of their own

professions. Some solicitors have also expressed

concern that multi-disciplinary practices might

unfairly attract business away from solicitors&apos;

practices, and that this, particularly if it led to

the development of large mixed practices, would so

decrease the number of solicitors in private practice

as to reduce significantly the public&apos;s freedom to

choose between a wide variety of sources of legal

services.



Arguments for change



12.3 Against that,  it has been argued that the prohibition



of multi-disciplinary practices is a significant

restriction on the freedom of solicitors to conduct

their business, which may be expected to result in

higher costs to clients, less efficient use of

resources, discouragement of new developments, and a

tendency towards rigidity in the structure and methods



2


CONFIDENTIAL



of solicitors&apos; businesses. Proponents of this view see

advantages to both solicitors and the public if multi-

disciplinary practices were allowed. They consider that

this would enable solicitors to:-



(a) compete more effectively with other professions

and businesses which can and do include legal

advice among the services they offer;



(b) meet more comprehensively the demand for

overlapping services from, for example, house

buyers and commercial clients; and



(c) adapt to the changing conditions of demand for

professional services, without either having to

employ artificial devices to avoid breaching

practice restrictions or being unable to reward

with partnership status senior employees from

other professional disciplines, including foreign

lawyers.



Many other professions, such as accountants, surveyors,

engineers and architects, permit multi-disciplinary

practices and their professional bodies have evolved

rules governing their operation. No significant

problems have been reported in relation to these

practices.



.4 The   public,   they  believe,   would  benefit   from the



greater flexibility which solicitors would enjoy

through efficiency gains, improved channels of

communication between the professions, and an increased

choice of legal services between independent solicitors

and practices providing a range of services. They argue

that the risks of multi-disciplinary practices have

been overstated in that:-



3


CONFIDENTIAL



(a) the choice between small practices offering a

close personal relationship between solicitor and

client and larger practices where there is a

greater degree of delegation already exists;

multi-disciplinary practices would do little to

narrow that choice (particularly if, as expected,

only a minority of solicitors would opt for mixed

practice);



(b) some solicitors&apos; firms are already organised to

provide a range of services by employing

specialists in other disciplines without any

diminution in standards of conduct; and



(c) safeguards can be devised which would provide

protection to clients of multi-disciplinary

practices similar to that afforded to clients of

solicitors&apos; practices.



The question whether solicitors should be free to

engage in practice with other professions was discussed

by the Royal Commission on Legal Services (the Benson

Commission) in 1979 and the Royal Commission on Legal

Services in Scotland (the Hughes Commission) in 1980.

Both Commissions considered the restriction in the

light of its capacity to protect the interests of the

public and enhance the level of legal services

available to the public. The Benson Commission decided

that the balance lay in favour of maintaining the

restriction. They acknowledged the potential

convenience of joint provision of overlapping or

closely connected professional services; but they

concluded that demand was limited, cost savings were

questionable,  client choice might be limited,  and that



History

12.5



4


CONFIDENTIAL



practical difficulties would stand in the way of

producing a common code of conduct for mixed

partnerships. The Hughes Commission took the opposite

view. They thought the risk of diminishing clients&apos;

choice of professional adviser would be small and would

be outweighed by the prospect of cross-fertilisation of

advice and greater access for clients to different

professional groups; and they thought the problems of

which professional bodies&apos; rules should apply to mixed

partnerships could be resolved by discussion between

professional bodies. Although they found little demand

at that time for development of multi-disciplinary

partnerships, they could see no good reason for

preventing their development at all; and they

recommended removal of the statutory ban on Scottish

solicitors sharing fees with others.



Recent developments



12.6 In 1986,  the Director General of Fair Trading reported



on a review, which he had undertaken at the request of

Ministers, of restrictions on the kind of organisation

through which members of the professions might offer

their services. The Director General noted the course

of debate about multi-disciplinary practices involving

solicitors since the reports of the two Royal

Commissions. He supported the view that such mixed

practices should be encouraged, with suitable

safeguards for the maintenance of professional

standards and adequate consumer protection. He

therefore recommended that Ministers should consider

amendment of the Solicitors Acts to remove statutory

prohibitions on solicitors sharing fees with non-

solicitors, and of any other statutory provisions which

might prevent solicitors from entering into partnership

or any other form of association with members of other

professions.   He  pointed  out  that  legislation  to this



5


CONFIDENTIAL



effect would be a necessary precursor to corresponding

alteration of the practice rules of the Law Societies.



12.7 In November 1987 the Scottish Home and Health

Department issued a discussion paper on the Practice of

the Solicitor&apos;s Profession in Scotland, which stated

that it seemed to the Secretary of State that the

weight of argument was clearly in favour of permitting

mixed practices of solicitors and other professions.

The paper invited observations in the light of which

the Secretary of State would further consider his

initial view that sections 26 and 27 of the Solicitors

(Scotland) Act 1980 should be amended so as to permit

the Law Society of Scotland to allow mixed professional

practices. The Secretary of State is at present

considering the responses to the discussion paper.



The Government&apos;s view



12.8 The Government considers that the range of choice

available to users of legal services in England and

Wales should not be limited unless there are strong

public interest reasons to the contrary, and that

restrictions on competition between solicitors should

be no greater than is necessary adequately to safeguard

the interests of their clients. In the light of this

and the Director General&apos;s recommendation, the

Government proposes to amend the Solicitors Act 1974 to

remove any statutory inhibition on the freedom of

solicitors in England and Wales to engage in multi-

disciplinary and multi-national practices. The

Government expects the Law Society to amend its

Practice Rules in the same way. Once the statutory

restrictions have been removed, the Law Society (or any

other professional body) would, of course, have to

satisfy  the  competition  authority  that  any remaining



6


CONFIDENTIAL



restrictions they imposed were not unnecessarily anti-

competitive.



Safeguards



12.9 The question therefore arises of how to maintain high

professional standards so as properly to safeguard the

interests of clients who seek legal services from

multi-disciplinary practices. This is primarily a

matter for the Law Society to consider in addressing

what changes would be required to its Practice Rules

and guidance on solicitors&apos; conduct. The rules of the

Council of Licensed Conveyancers already permit

licensed conveyancers to practise in partnership with

other professions, subject to the Council&apos;s decision as

to the suitability of the other professions concerned.

These rules might provide the Law Society with a model

on which to work. There appears to be no reason why

mixed practices should be possible only in the

partnership form; a corporate structure (which

solicitors in England and Wales will shortly be enabled

to employ, as Scottish solicitors now can), even one

where solicitors did not control the ownership of the

company, could equally provide the vehicle.



12.10 The essential need is to provide the same level of

safeguards as presently exist in respect of

solicitors&apos; practices. One approach would be through

discussions between the Law Society and other

professional bodies with a view either to agreeing a

common code of practice or to harmonising relevant

aspects of different professions&apos; codes of practice.

The Government notes the steps that the Law Society has

recently taken to arrange discussions and hopes that

these will come to a speedy and successful conclusion.

In either event, the Government considers that other

professional  bodies  should,   if  necessary,   add  to the



7


CONFIDENTIAL



requirements imposed upon their members to bring them

up to the standards of client protection of the Law

Society - at least for those who opt to practise

jointly with solicitors - on the principle of aiming

for the highest common factor.



12.11 Ultimately,   however,   the maintenance of standards and



safeguards in any profession depends on each of its

members taking personal responsibility for observing

its rules and codes of conduct, and on his or her

professional body having effective disciplinary

procedures to enforce observance where necessary. The

Government therefore considers it essential that each

member of a multi-disciplinary practice should remain

individually subject to the rules of his or her

professional body. The central principle must be that

each member should remain personally responsible for

the activities of the practice within their own

professional field and should personally control the

work involved, particularly in respect of functions

reserved by statute to any particular profession. It

will therefore be essential for a solicitor&apos;s personal

responsibility to his or her profession as a lawyer to

override, in any case of conflict of interest or rule,

his or her responsibility to the practice as a whole

and to fellow-members of it. If necessary, the

Government is prepared to legislate to ensure the

primacy of that personal responsibility. Subject to

these considerations, the Government does not envisage

statutory prescription of those with whom solicitors

might be allowed to practise jointly. To do so would,

in the Government&apos;s view, be to impose an unnecessary

rigidity on solicitors&apos; freedom to adapt to changing

circumstances.



Barristers



8


CONFIDENTIAL



12.12 Both the Benson Commission and the Hughes Commission

concluded that there should be no relaxation of the

prohibition on barristers and advocates respectively

forming any kind of partnership practice. They regarded

sole practice as crucial to the individualism and

detachment of efficient advocacy, and were concerned

that partnership practice - whether between barristers

or between barristers and solicitors - would reduce the

choice available to clients. They did not therefore

contemplate the possibility of partnerships between

barristers and members of other professions.



The Government&apos; s view



12.13 The Government thinks that barristers should now be

permitted to operate in partnerships, should they

choose to do so, for the reasons set out in Chapter 11

of this Green Paper at paras 11.13 to 11.17.



12.14 This raises the possibility of barristers being allowed

to enter into multi-disciplinary practices. In view of

the proposals in this Green Paper as to legal education

(Chapter 3), advocacy (Chapter 5), direct access to

counsel (Chapter 8) and judicial appointments

(Chapter 10) there appears to be no good reason to

distinguish in the future between barristers and

solicitors in this respect. The advantages in terms

both of improving the provision of legal services and

of the need to maintain safeguards to the public are in

principle similar in both cases. On safeguards, the

crucial requirement must be that no obligation a

barrister undertakes to partners or to anyone else

should take precedence over his professional duty as a

barrister to the courts, to his client and to the

members of his profession. Subject to that, and any

necessary legislative provision to ensure that a

barrister&apos;s  wider  obligations  would  remain paramount



9


CONFIDENTIAL



over his obligations to fellow-members of a multi-

disciplinary practice, the Government considers that

the code of conduct of the Bar should be amended to

allow barristers to choose the form of organisation

through which they practise.



(B)   Multi-national practices

Present Position



12.15 At present the same restrictions which prevent

solicitors in England and Wales joining a multi-

disciplinary practice also prevent them from practising

in conjunction with lawyers from another jurisdiction.

A solicitor who forms a partnership with a foreign

lawyer may not, as a partner of the foreign firm,

perform any of the functions reserved by statute to

qualified persons. A solicitor may, however, perform

such functions, if he establishes his own firm, while

at the same time being a partner of the foreign firm.

The restrictions on barristers practising except

independently apply also in this area.



Arguments against change



12.15 There are three main arguments against change:-



(a) there are difficult questions about the regulation

of firms whose partners are subject to different

professional bodies. Fears have been expressed

that the standards of the profession could be

compromised;



(b) foreign firms might dominate or even take over

domestic firms in some areas and this could be

contrary to the public interest; and



(c) the present arrangements permit a wide range of

forms of association short of partnership. English



10


CONFIDENTIAL



solicitors have taken full advantage of these.

Full partnership is not therefore necessary,

particularly in the light of the difficult

regulatory problems.



Arguments for change



12.17 The following points are made in favour of change:-



(a) the demand for multi-national legal practices is

growing as commercial operations become more

international. This will undoubtedly be given a

further fillip by the completion of the single

market in Europe. English solicitors should be in

a position to meet the market demand, unless any

restrictions can be justified on public interest

grounds. If the restrictions are not lifted, there

is a risk that English solicitors will lose out to

foreign lawyers who are permitted to be more

flexible;



(b) some other countries (e.g. the Netherlands) and

other UK professions (e.g. accountants) permit

multi-national practices. English solicitors are

permitted also to be partners in foreign practices

subject to certain rules. This suggests that the

regulatory concern is one that can, in principle,

be met;



(c) the UK&apos;s general inward investment policies do not

support excluding foreign firms for fear of

dominance or take over in a particular sector.

Normal competition policy prevents anticompetitive

mergers or monopolies. The Government endorses

this argument for change as long as professional

standards are maintained; and



11


CONFIDENTIAL



(d) the EC directive on the mutual recognition of

professional qualifications (which comes into

force in early 1991) will assist lawyers from

other member states in gaining access to the legal

professions in England and Wales. Continuing

restrictions on English lawyers&apos; rights to form

partnerships with colleagues from other member

states would be anomalous in the context of such a

move toward a freer Community - wide market in

professional services.



Safeguards



12.18 As with multi-disciplinary practices, the Government is

not persuaded that the public interest justifies the

maintenance of restrictions on multi-national

practices. Removal of the statutory restrictions would

permit multi-national practices in principle. The

issue would then be whether adequate safeguards can be

established over multi-national practices to maintain

professional standards and client protection.



12.19 The Government&apos;s view is that, as far as possible,

safeguards should be a matter for professional self

regulation rather than Government control. Once the

statutory restrictions had been lifted, the

professions would, however, have to justify any

remaining restrictions on the way that legal

partnerships are operated to the competition authority.



12.20 There is a range of options on the operation of

safeguards which are not necessarily mutually

exclusive. The professional bodies would presumably

want their members to remain subject to their own

rules. They could require registration of a multi-

national practice. All partners in a multi-national

practice  could  then  be  subject  to  certain specific



12


CONFIDENTIAL



rules, although this approach might mean that foreign

lawyers were effectively being required to be English

solicitors rather than bringing their own expertise to

the practice. An alternative option would be for the

professional body to allow multi-national partnerships

with lawyers who are bound by the rules of professional

bodies of similar standing.



12.21 Once the statutory restrictions are lifted and the EC

directive on mutual recognition of professional

qualifications is implemented, the Government considers

that the prevention of partnerships with EC lawyers

would be increasingly anomalous. The Government also

believes that it should be possible to extend multi-

national practices to lawyers from other jurisdictions.



The Government&apos;s view



12.22 In   summary,   the  Government  considers   that   the legal



professions should be as free as possible, consistent

with the safeguarding of clients&apos; interests, to offer

their services in the ways that they find best meet the

demands of clients. The same amendments to the

Solicitors Act 1974 which will remove the statutory

inhibitions on multi-disciplinary practices will serve

to open the way for multi-national practices. The

Government hopes therefore that the professional bodies

will urgently review their own rules governing the

establishment of these.

CHAPTER 13 ? ADVERTISING AND INFORMATION



13.1 Clients need adequate information in order to make a

sensible choice of a lawyer and to get maximum value

for money through the lawyer and client relationship.



Background



13.2 The legal profession, like many other professions, has

traditionally placed restrictions through practice

rules or codes of conduct on the freedom of its members

individually to inform the public about what services

they offer and at what price. These restrictions in

part reflected a feeling that practices such as

advertising and price competition, which are common and

unobjectionable in a commercial context, were

undignified in a professional context and incompatible

with the status and image of the profession. It was

argued that individual advertising - as opposed to

information about itself and its services disseminated

by the profession collectively - would damage the

relationship of trust between lawyer and client, and

that it could be misleading to members of the public

who consult a lawyer only occasionally and who are in

any case not well placed to judge the quality of

service offered.



The Government&apos;s approach



13.3 The Government considers that no further restraint is

necessary on the way in which information is given

about the legal profession beyond the principles of the

British Code of Advertising Practice of the Advertising

Standards Authority, which are that advertising should

be legal, decent, honest and truthful. In the opinion

of the Government these are strong safeguards. There

should be no barriers to the publication of relevant

information about the practices of the profession and



1


CONFIDENTIAL



the services it offers. This would help greatly to

ensure that:-



(a) individual members of the public are enabled to

make an informed choice of the legal adviser most

suited to their needs;



(b) it becomes easier for newly qualified lawyers to

enter into and establish practice;



(c) there is an incentive for established lawyers to

improve their efficiency and the quality of the

services they offer; and



(d) there is an encouragement to lower charges.



The overall benefit to both lawyers and their clients

will, in the Government&apos;s view, improve the access of

the public to justice.



Present position



13.4 Restrictions on the freedom to advertise of members of

both branches of the profession were examined in

reports of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which

were published in 1976. The Commission came to

different conclusions in the conditions prevailing at

that time. Consequently the present position on

providing information differs as between solicitors and

barristers.



(a) Solicitors



13.5 The Monopolies and Mergers Commission concluded that

the restrictions on solicitors which then existed

operated against the public interest. They recommended

that Rule 1 of the Solicitors&apos; Practice Rules, which

placed   a   general   prohibition   on   advertising and



2


CONFIDENTIAL



soliciting business, should be terminated, and that it

should be replaced by a rule which would permit any

solicitor to use, whenever he thought fit, such methods

of publicity as he thought fit provided that they did

not: ?



(a) claim  for  his  practice  superiority over  any  or all

other solicitors&apos; practices;



(b) contain any inaccuracies or misleading statements; or



(c) possess a character that could reasonably be regarded

as likely to bring the profession into disrepute.



As a result of changes made to Practice Rule 1 and

guidance issued by the Law Society in 1984, 1987 and

1988, solicitors are now free to advertise their

services through any medium; and they may specify the

fees they charge for particular services or the fact

that they are prepared to give a quotation. The Law

Society has also taken a number of steps to publicise

the availability of solicitors&apos; services generally.



(b) Barristers

13.6



As to barristers, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission

concluded that the absolute ban in the Bar Council

rules on advertising, touting and publicity did not

operate against the public interest. The Commission

distinguished barristers&apos; services from those of other

professions in that the lay client could (and still

can) approach a barrister only through a solicitor.

They took the view that the client was - almost

uniquely - not disadvantaged by lack of information

since he could rely on the advice of his solicitor as

to which barrister to instruct. The Commission thought

that the Bar Council rules concerned did not prevent



3


CONFIDENTIAL



solicitors from obtaining sufficient information

adequately to advise clients. Moreover they thought the

rules did not place any significant obstacles in the

way of established barristers improving their

efficiency and standard of service, or in the way of

new barristers establishing themselves, given that

barristers were required to practise singly

(partnership being then, as now, prohibited) as a

member of chambers. Consequently, the Commission did

not recommend any change to the Bar Council rules.



13.7 In 1988 the Bar Council simplified its rules and issued



a code of advertising and publicity, which permits the

issue of a certain amount of information in approved

directories and local newspapers and in approved

chambers&apos; leaflets. The position is, however, still

substantially similar to that examined by the

Monopolies and Mergers Commission and remains very

restrictive in relation to individual barristers,

especially in regard to giving information direct to

the public.



The Government&apos;s view

(a) Solicitors



13.8 The  present  Practice  Rules  and  guidance  of  the Law



Society on advertising by individual solicitors,

combined with the action taken by the Law Society to

issue information about solicitors&apos; services generally,

go a long way towards realising the advantages of

publicity set out in para 13.3 above. Further

consideration will, however, be needed about how best

to bring to public attention the specialist skills and

qualifications envisaged in Chapter 3. Although there

is obvious advantage in making such specialisms widely

known, it would be counter-productive if any amendment

to  the  Practice  Rules   and  guidance  were   to prevent



4


CONFIDENTIAL



solicitors from advertising the availability of

services in particular areas in which they are

experienced, but do not have a specialist

qualification.



(b) Barristers



13.9 In view of the proposals about advocacy (Chapter 5) and

direct access by lay clients to barristers (Chapter 8),

the factors which led the Monopolies and Mergers

Commission not to recommend any change in the Bar rules

on publicity appear no longer to be relevant. It is

therefore envisaged that the Bar Council ?s rules and

code will need amendment to put them on the same lines

as those the Law Society now has.



The Civil Justice Review&apos;s recommendation



13.10 Some alteration of existing professional practices will

be needed in any event, in order to implement one

important recommendation in the report of the Civil

Justice Review. In its chapter on access to justice,

that report recognised that fear of costs is a major

factor which inhibits use of the Courts; and it

recommended that solicitors and barristers should be

encouraged and expected to provide information by way

of stated rates per case per hour. The Government

endorses this finding and strongly supports the

recommendation. For solicitors it may be necessary for

the Law Society to consider how its existing rules and

guidance might be strengthened in order to produce more

specific details. The Code of Conduct of the Bar

effectively prohibits barristers from publishing their

charges. Accordingly the Government believes that the

code should both be relaxed to permit this and also

expanded so as to encourage the routine provision of

information about fees in individual cases.


CONFIDENTIAL



CHAPTER 14 - PROBATE



Introduction



14.1 In this chapter the Government sets out why it proposes

to amend section 23 of the Solicitors Act 1974 which

imposes restrictions on those who may draw or prepare

for reward certain papers in connection with non-

contentious applications for probate and letters of

administration. It seeks views on whether the

restrictions should be removed altogether or whether

applications for reward should be made only by specific

classes of persons.



Existing restrictions



14.2 Under section 23 of the Solicitors Act 1974 it is an

offence for anyone apart from a solicitor, barrister or

notary to draw or prepare for reward the papers on

which to found a grant of probate or letters of

administration.



14.3 The papers required are:-



(a) an affidavit by which the applicant for the grant

swears that he will administer the estate

according to the law and



(i) if he is an executor, swears that he is the

executor named and identifies the will as the

last will of the deceased; or



(ii) if there is no executor or no will,

identifies his title to the grant;



(b) very occasionally, affidavits in respect of

certain other matters; and



1


CONFIDENTIAL



(c) an Inland Revenue account signed by the executor

or administrator. (However this is not required in

most cases where the estate is worth less than

 70,000).



14.4 Applications for a grant may be made in person or by a

solicitor. The Non-Contentious Probate Rules provide

that only applications by a solicitor do not require

personal attendance at the Probate Registry.



Difficulties created



14.5 It is common practice for a testator to nominate a bank

as his executor. A bank for this purpose operates as a

trust corporation. The expression &quot;trust corporation&quot;

is defined by section 128 of the Supreme Court Act 1981

and the Law of Property (Amendment) Act 1926 as

meaning the Public Trustee, a corporation appointed by

the Court in any particular case to be a trustee, or a

corporation entitled under the Public Trustee Rules to

act as custodian trustee. The list of corporations

entitled to act is large and varied. It includes the

Treasury Solicitor, charities authorised by the Lord

Chancellor, local authorities, and organizations like

British Gas, London Regional Transport and the British

Coal Corporation in relation to their pension funds.

It also includes UK or EEC companies which are

empowered to undertake trust business, have at least

one place of business in England and Wales and have

issued capital of  250,000 of which not less than

 100,000 has been paid up in cash. Examples of such

companies are insurance companies and, as stated at the

beginning of the paragraph, banks.



14.6 A trust corporation is, like any other executor,

entitled to administer the estate in respect of which

it has been appointed.    However,  as it receives a fee



2


CONFIDENTIAL



for being executor, it cannot prepare the affidavit or

account. Nor can it make a personal application for

probate as it is specifically excluded from doing this

by the Non-Contentious Probate Rules. It must

therefore instruct a solicitor to prepare the papers

and make the application on its behalf.



14.7 It might appear that it could avoid these difficulties

by making the application through an in-house

solicitor. However there is some doubt as to whether

this would be lawful. It is argued that the

restrictions on unqualified persons (i.e. those who are

not solicitors) cannot be avoided by an unqualified

person employing a solicitor to act as his agent. If

this interpretation of section 23 is correct, the

result is illogical, bearing in mind that employed

solicitors are able to litigate on behalf of their

employers and will soon be able to provide conveyancing

services on their behalf. Nevertheless, the wording of

section 23 can be seen as a bar on making applications

for grants through employed solicitors.



14.8 Banks have been arguing for some time that section 23

should be amended so that they are clearly permitted to

make applications for grants. In addition licensed

conveyancers now argue that they need to be able to

make applications on behalf of clients. An obvious

example is where their clients need to obtain a grant

of probate to obtain a good title. At the moment,

unless clients are willing to make personal

applications, licensed conveyancers have to send them

to solicitors.



Justification for restrictions



14.9 The  justification  for  the  restrictions  in  section 23



would appear to be:-



3


CONFIDENTIAL



(a) the need to protect the estate. The protection

that the section might give could be only very

limited. It does not apply to cases where the

executor or his agent acts without reward. It

does not protect the estate once it is in the

hands of the executors which is the stage at which

most dishonesty would take place. It bites only

on the formal application for the grant.



(b) the need to protect the courts from poorly

prepared documents. In cases where trust

corporations administer estates, it is thought

that they prepare the documentation so the role of

the solicitor is purely nominal. In the view of

the Probate Registry, documents prepared by trust

corporations are at least as well prepared as

those prepared by solicitors. The Probate

Registry checks all applications and will not

issue a grant unless it is satisfied that all is

in order.



14.10 The Law Society were until recently firmly against any



change. The President, however, in his recent address

to the Law Society Conference, said:-



&quot;We are reassessing the areas of work in which we

retain privileged positions. For example, the

Council is looking again at whether the monopoly

we enjoy by statute for taking out probate and

letters of administration, is really justified in

the public interest. I will tell you my view.

Non-contentious probate is an area of work which

as a profession we have traditionally dominated.

Where banks or other trust corporations have been

instructed as executors to undertake the bulk of



4


CONFIDENTIAL



the winding up of an estate is there really a

public safeguard in requiring only the probate

papers themselves to be drawn and lodged by a

solicitor? We know that our charges for

executorship are modest compared with those the

bank charge, and we should be publicising this

fact to our clients. If we cannot stand on our

reputation in this area and maintain a substantial

share of the market, we do not deserve to have it

artificially maintained for us by protective

legislation.&quot;



The Government welcomes this constructive approach.



Relaxation



14.11 The  Government   has   concluded  that   it  can  no longer



justify maintaining the present statutory restriction

on those who may make applications for grants of

probate or letters of administration for reward in non-

contentious cases. However it wishes to seek views on

whether the right course is to widen the class of

people who may apply for reward - Option A - or

whether it is safe to remove the restriction

altogether - Option B.



Option A



14.12 Documents have to be completed properly and executors

need to be aware of any irregularities in the drafting

of the will. There is also a possibility, should the

restrictions go altogether, of a new breed of

unregulated probate practitioner. The Probate Registry

cannot be expected to pick up every mistake or attempt

at fraud. It might be sensible to provide that

applications for reward should only be made by

specific   classes   of   person  who   are   likely   to be



5


14.13



14.14



14.15



Option  

14.16



CONFIDENTIAL



reputable and who may well be regulated by statute or a

professional body.



The obvious examples of such classes (apart from

solicitors, barristers and notaries) are:-



(a) trust corporations;



(b) licensed conveyancers;



(c) authorised practitioners - as proposed in the

Consultation Paper on Conveyancing by Authorised

Pract i t ioners; and



(d) chartered and certified accountants.



The list in para 14.13 is not intended to be exhaustive

and the Government would wish to consider

representations from any other class which considers it

might properly be included.



As explained in para 14.4, at present only solicitors

may make applications for a grant without attending the

Registry in person. It would seem to be both sensible

and simple to put all the classes which are ultimately

accepted in exactly the same position.



It is difficult to assess the practical as opposed to

the theoretical problems of unregulated probate

practitioners setting up in business. Furthermore, if

there is a specific list of accepted persons, as

suggested in para 14.13, there will inevitably be

applications from those who would wish to add

themselves. Option A may therefore cause more trouble

than it is worth if the risk of fraud and error is

very small.



6


CONFIDENTIAL



14.17 On the other hand, where fraud or error does occur the

public would be less well protected in the case of

unregulated probate practitioners. In addition, if

anyone were able to apply for a grant as agent for

another, it would be less justifiable to relax the

requirement that all those except solicitors must

attend the Registry in person. It would not be

sensible to remove the requirement altogether, as it

does help the Registry to ensure as far as possible

that applications are made by the person properly

entitled. On the other hand, any attempt to define

those who need not attend seems to be a partial return

to Option A.



Under either Option A or B, for those who do not make

an application for a grant through a solicitor or

notary, there is a further obstacle in the way of a

one-stop probate service. Only a solicitor or notary

may administer the oaths referred to in paras 14.3(a)

and (b). This raises the question whether the

requirement to swear an oath is too cumbersome and

should be removed, on the understanding that making a

dishonest unsworn statement for the purpose of an

application would continue to be a criminal offence.

The Government would welcome views on this suggestion.



Relaxation confined to non-contentious cases



14.19 Although the Government intends to remove the

restrictions in non-contentious cases, it is not

proposing to remove them in cases which are or become

contentious. Such cases need to conducted by those

with the necessary skill and training to conduct

litigation and appear in court.



Possible special controls



The oath

14.18



7


CONFIDENTIAL



(a) Code of conduct



14.20 In the past it was suggested that there should be a

code of conduct if trust corporations were to be

allowed to apply for probate. The Government considers

that there is no merit in this suggestion. As

previously explained, the application for probate is a

very small part of the administration of an estate and

the code would not apply to the rest. It is also

difficult to know what it could provide other than that

applications should be made competently and honestly.

Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of applicants

will already be subject to statutory or professional

controls over the way   they conduct themselves.



(b) Charges



14.21 An anxiety often expressed about banks is that their

charges for executorship are too high and are not

subject to controls as are the charges of solicitors.

(Benson, as a qualification to its general

recommendation about trust corporations, proposed that

charges by those who are not solicitors should be

subject to control.)



14.22 In the past the banks have argued that one reason why

their charges are high is because they have had to pay

solicitors to do work which they have virtually done

already. Whether this is true or not, the Government

believes that in principle prices should be set by

market forces and that its role is confined to ensuring

that prices are clearly and truthfully expressed.

Banks publish tables of fees. It is up to the testator

to make his choice. This now also seems to be the view

of the Law Society.



Summary



14.23 The government would welcome views on whether



8


CONFIDENTIAL



(a) anybody  should  be  entitled  to make  applications for

grants of probate or letters of administration; or



(b) only specified classes of person and, if so, who should

they be?



(c) the requirement to swear an oath should be abolished.



9


CONFIDENTIAL

Competition in the EC



ANNEX A



At the moment:-



(a) the UK 18 already bound by the requirement of the EC treaty

to abolish restrictions on the freedom of establishment of

nationals of a member state in the territory of another

member state and by the requirement to abolish restrictions

on freedom to provide services within the Community;



(b) discrimination on the grounds of nationality which might

prevent lawyers from one member state practising in another

is not permitted;



(c) UK lawyers, either as firms or individuals, are permitted to

practise under their home state title in EC member states

without acquiring a local qualification provided that they

do not engage in work reserved for the host legal

profession; and



(d) under the Legal Services Directive of 1977 a lawyer from

one member state has the right to plead in the courts of

another member state provided that he acts in co-operation

with a local lawyer who has rights of audience before the

court or tribunal in question.



The plans to achieve a single internal market from the end of

1992 will have further consequences for the provision of legal

services in EC member states:-



(a) The Council Directive on a general system for recognition of

higher education diplomas, adopted by the Council of

Ministers on 21 December 1988, will promote the freedom of

members of professions to provide services throughout the EC

and make it easier for a professional in one member state to

practise in other member states as a member of the local



1


CONFIDENTIAL



profession. Member states have two years in which to take

the measures necessary to comply with the Directive. As far

as lawyers are concerned, member states will have a choice

between requiring an incoming professional to take an

aptitude test or go through an adaptation period.

Accordingly once he has completed the aptitude test or

adaptation period and satisfied other relevant conditions,

he will be entitled to admission as a full member of the

host state legal profession;



(b) there will be an increased demand as a result of the

directive both for host state practice (e.g. UK lawyers

acquiring the local qualifications in another member state)

and for home state practice (e.g. UK lawyers practising in

other member states without acquiring local qualifications).

It will be important to safeguard the possibility of

establishment under both methods; and



(c) there will be an increased demand to remove restrictions on

multi-national practices.



As far as the law itself is concerned there is likely by 1992 to

be both an increased body of English law implementing EC

directives and an increased body of EC law. Both business and

private clients will be affected. Business clients especially are

likely to become more active in the common market. They will need

advice on matters such as the best place and form in which to set

up business, whether there are advantages in having their

contracts governed by the law of a particular state, and the

proper forum in which to bring proceedings. Only those English

lawyers prepared to develop an expertise in European Community

law and practice and the law of EC Member States will be in a

position to offer this advice. English lawyers who do not will

lose the opportunity to compete both in the European market and

at home.

ANNEX  



THE PROVIDERS OF LEGAL SERVICES

Barristers



1 The General Council of the Bar is the governing body of

the Bar. It is responsible for policy matters

affecting the Bar and for the professional conduct of

barristers. Every barrister must be a member of one of

the four Inns of Court (Lincoln&apos;s Inn, Inner Temple,

Middle Temple, and Gray&apos;s Inn). The Inns have the sole

right to call men and women to the Bar and to disbar

them in the event of misconduct.



Qualification



2 There are three stages to qualifying as a barrister.

The first, or academic, stage consists of a law degree

or, for non-law graduates, a one year Diploma Course in

substantive law. The Bar usually requires as a

minimum a second class honours degree before allowing

students to proceed to the second, or vocational, stage

of training. This is run by the profession and

currently consists of a 30-week course at the Council

of Legal Education leading to the Bar Final

examination. Once the student has passed the Bar

Finals, and provided that he or she has kept the

requisite number of terms at their Inn of Court (which

normally takes two years), he or she is entitled to be

called to the Bar. He or she is not, however, allowed

to practise until he or she has completed the third

stage of training which is called pupillage. This

lasts for 12 months and is similar to an

apprenticeship. The pupil is attached to a pupil

master, an experienced barrister whose function it is

to instruct the pupil in the skills he or she will need

to practise at the Bar and to instill in him or or her

the  ethics  of  their profession.     The Bar introduced



1


CONFIDENTIAL



i practising certificates and check lists for pupils in



the autumn of 1988. After six months of pupillage the

pupil must obtain a certificate from his or her pupil

master confirming that he or she has satisfactorily

completed the first stage of their pupillage. The Bar

Council will then issue him or her with a practising

certificate entitling him or her to take cases on their

own account. On satisfactory completion of a further

six months pupillage, confirmed by the production of a

further signed certificate from his or her pupil

master, the Bar Council will issue him or her with a

Final Certificate enabling him or her to become a

f ully.rf ledged practising barrister either in

independent practice or employment. There is no

requirement that pupil barristers be paid a salary

during their pupillage, although various awards and

grants are available from the Council of Legal

Education, the Inns of Court and an increasing number

of sets of chambers. (See para 4 below for an

explanation of the chambers system.)



3 There is no compulsory continuing education for

barristers after pupillage, although the Bar has plans

to introduce this. Courses are already organised for

practitioners on, for instance, the interpretation of

company accounts, EC law and matters of interest to

the specialist Bar Associations.



Practice at the Bar



4 In order to practise at the Bar a barrister must,

according to the rules of his or her profession, be a

member of a set of chambers which includes having the

services of a clerk. There were in the autumn of 1988

about 6,000 barristers practising from a total of 359

sets of chambers; 231 of these sets were in London and

128 were in the provinces.    Again, according to his or



2


CONFIDENTIAL



her professional rules, a barrister must practise as an

individual (partnerships are not permitted) and, with

a few exceptions relating to other professions, a

barrister is not allowed to take instructions directly

from lay clients but may act only on the instructions

of a solicitor. (Direct access to barristers is

considered in Chapter 8.)



The employed Bar



5 Many barristers are employed in commerce and industry

and by central and local government. The exact number

of employed barristers is unknown although it is likely

to be in excess of 5,000. Special professional rules

apply to employed barristers: for instance, such a

barrister may not supply legal services to the public,

most employed barristers are not allowed to instruct

counsel directly and, by virtue of a combination of

statutory provisions and practice rules, the rights of

audience of employed barristers are currently even more

restricted than those of solicitors. (See Annex E:

paras 19-21.)



Solicitors



6 The Law Society is the professional body of solicitors.

In contrast to the Bar, many aspects of the

solicitors&apos; profession, such as entry, practice and

conduct and discipline, are regulated by statute (the

Solicitors Act 1974, c.47, as amended).



Qualification



7 As with barristers, solicitors have several stages to

their training. The academic stage is satisfied by a

law degree, or by passing the Solicitors First

Examination (for non-graduates), or by passing the Law



3


CONFIDENTIAL



Society&apos;s Common Professional Examination (a one-year

law course for non-law graduates). Completion of the

academic stage entitles the student to take the 36-week

course leading to the Solicitors Final Examination. As

with the Bar, the vocational stage of training is

exclusively under the control of the profession.

Before being admitted as a solicitor, a student must

also serve a period of practical training or

apprenticeship called articles. The student is

articled to an experienced solicitor for between two

and five years, depending on his or her method of

qualification. The Law Society prescribes the terms

and conditions of articled clerkship and insists that

the articled clerk is paid at least the recommended

minimum salary, which in the autumn of 1988 was  6,000

in the provinces,  6,900 in outer London and  7,200 in

inner London.



8 From 1 August 1985 the Law Society has required

solicitors, in the first three years after admission to

the Roll, to attend a system of continuing education.

There are compulsory courses in office management and

communication, standards of professional conduct and

ethics and the handling of professional responsibility.

In addition, the newly-qualified solicitor has to

attend a certain number of voluntary courses over the

three year period.



Practice as a solicitor



9 Solicitors may practise as sole practitioners or in

partnership. In the autumn of 1988 there were 50,337

solicitors holding practising certificates. Between

March 1986 and March 1987, the number of solicitors&apos;

practices increased by 2.3% in the North (Wales, the

North and Midlands above the Severn ? Wash Line), 3.9%

in the South (including   Anglia but excluding London),



4


CONFIDENTIAL



and 5.1% In London (the old GLC area).1 When s.9 of the

Administration of Justice Act 1985 is brought into

force (which is expected to be later this year),

solicitors will be able to practise in corporate form

with both limited and unlimited liability. Over

recent years there has been a tendency for firms of

solicitors to amalgamate to form larger units. The

latest figures2 indicate that between 1986 and 1987 the

number of firms with 11 or more principals Increased by

7.5%. These large firms can provide a specialised range

of services, especially in the commercial field, and it

is possible that such firms are now providing some of

the expert advice which was previously given by the

specialist Bar.



Employed solicitors



10 In 1987/88 3,258 solicitors were employed by local and

national government and 2,892 solicitors were employed

in commerce and other employments.3 An employed

solicitor who either holds or is exempted from holding

a practising certificate is treated in all respects as

any other practising solicitor with one proviso,

namely, that since he or she has only one client - his

or her employer ? he or she is generally prohibited by

professional rules from doing work directly for the

public.



Notaries



11 Notaries, who are often solicitors who have undertaken

additional academic and practical training, have a

highly specialised legal function. Their main business

18 to certify deeds and other documents under their

official seal, for use anywhere in the world, so that

such documents will be acceptable to judicial or

public authorities as proof of the matters attested.

For instance, notaries certify documents to take effect

abroad, prepare and translate documents for use abroad,

translate documents emanating from overseas, protest

bills of exchange, certify copies, administer oaths and

take affidavits, note and draw up ships&apos; protests and

advise on matters of English and foreign law.



Legal executives



12 Legal executives have both an academic and practical

training and work mainly in solicitors&apos; offices and

legal departments of large organisations, including

central and local government, commerce and industry.

In practice legal executives are able to do all the

work of solicitors except the work which is reserved to

solicitors by statute (see Chapter 2 paras 2.1-2.2).

There were in the autumn of 1988 around 16,500

subscribers to the Institute of Legal Executives.



Licensed conveyancers



13 This 18 a new profession established by the

Administration of Justice Act 1985. Standards of

competence and professional conduct are regulated by

the Council for Licensed Conveyancers. There were in

early 1989 approximately 500 licensed conveyancers.

Licensed conveyancers are licensed to provide

conveyancing services as defined by 8.11(3) of the

Adminstration of Justice Act 1985 and may act in

domestic   and   commercial   transactions. Licensed



6


CONFIDENTIAL



conveyancers have to pass examinations before being

allowed to practise. Their final examination is

similar in standard to the final examination taken by

solicitors although it obviously covers a much narrower

range of subjects namely, conveyancing, landlord and

tenant law, organisations and revenue law and accounts.

In addition, licensed conveyancers have to complete two

years of practical training.



14 Licensed conveyancers may practise on their own

account, although not for the first three years after

qualifying, or in partnership. Mixed partnerships with

other professions deemed suitable by the Council for

Licensed Conveyancers are allowed, although there are

no mixed partnerships as yet. Licensed Conveyancers

will during 1989 be able to practise in corporate

bodies controlled by licensed conveyancers. Licensed

conveyancers may be employed by non-licensed

conveyancers, but at the moment (see the consultation

paper on conveyancing services issued today) they

cannot provide conveyancing services to the clients of

such employers.



Patent agents



15 Patent agents are specialist practitioners who deal

with obtaining and enforcing intellectual property

rights. They have both an academic and practical

training and work either in the patent departments of

large industrial organisations or in private firms of

patent agents. Patent agents no longer have a monopoly

on their practice. The Copyright Designs and Patents

Act 1988 allows anyone to practise as a patent agent

but reserves the use of the title &quot;patent agent&quot; and

&quot;patent attorney&quot; to those who are on the register kept



7


CONFIDENTIAL



by the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents. Solicitors

may also use the title &quot;patent attorney&quot;.



Insolvency practitioners



16 Under the Insolvency Act 1986 insolvency practitioners

practise as trustees in bankruptcy, liquidators,

administrators, receivers and supervisors of voluntary

arrangements. Insolvency practitioners are usually

accountants, solicitors or members of the Insolvency

Practitioners Association. Insolvency practitioners

have to be authorised by professional bodies recognised

for that purpose by the Secretary of State for Trade

and Industry. If the practitioner is not a member of a

recognised body, then authorisation has to be obtained

from the Insolvency Practitioners Association, or,

failing that, the Secretary of State.



Banks, building societies,    accountants and chartered secretaries



17 Banks, building societies, accountants and chartered

secretaries give legal advice to their clients on such

matters as taxation, wills, insolvency and company law.



Law centres



18 The first law centre was set up in 1970 in North

Kensington, London. There are now around 60 centres.

Most of these are concentrated in urban areas. Law

centres are staffed by a variety of advisers including

salaried lawyers and tend to specialise mainly in

welfare law, immigration and housing.



Citizens advice bureaux



8


CONFIDENTIAL



19 Citizens advice bureaux (CABx) were originally

established in 1939 to give emergency services during

the second World War. There are now over a thousand

such bureaux handling around 6.8 million enquiries a

year. CABx give advice on a variety of matters

including social security, consumer protection,

housing, the family, employment, health, education and

Immigration and nationality. Most advice 18 given by

trained lay volunteers although most CABx have access

to a solicitor on at least a rota basis.



Trade tin ions



20 Trade unions provide advice and assistance to their

members on employment matters and will usually arrange

representation on such matters for their members in

tribunals and courts. Some trade unions also provide

general legal advice to members either in-house or by

referral to an outside solicitor.



The Royal British Legion



21 The Royal British Legion employs lay people, usually

ex-servicemen, to work full-time on advising and

representing appellants before the Pensions Appeals

Tribunal. These lay people receive on-the-job training

and are recognised as having considerable expertise in

their field.

ANNEX C



ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING



1. The appropriate training for lawyers will be a matter

for consideration by the Advisory Committee. It seems

sensible, however, that legal education should contain

the following four stages: academic, vocational,

practical and continuing (i.e. post-qualification)

education.



(i) Academic stage



2. The current core subjects are as follows:



constitutional and administrative law



contract



tort



land law

trusts



criminal law



3. Marre has recently suggested that consideration should

be given to teaching trusts and land law as a composite

subject; and the Advisory Committee may wish to

consider recommending this. In view of the thrust

suggested for the vocational course (see para 4 below)

the Advisory Committee might also consider whether

evidence should be included among the core subjects to

be studied at the academic stage. In addition, tuition

at the academic stage ought perhaps to reflect the

increasing importance of financial regulation and the

EC. The Advisory Committee will be invited to consider

whether and how this could be covered in core subjects

at the academic stage.



(ii) Vocational stage



4. The Government considers that the emphasis at the

vocational stage should be on the acquisition of the

practical skills necessary for practice as a lawyer.

The Government agrees with the views expressed in the



1


CONFIDENTIAL



Ormrod, Benson and Marre reports that there are strong

arguments in favour of a common system of vocational

training to cover the whole legal profession. The

Advisory Committee might accordingly wish to consider

giving a high priority to the development of a core of

minimum requirements for the vocational stage of

training.



These minimum requirements could, for instance, cover:



(a) civil procedure including probate;



(b) criminal procedure and sentencing;



(c) advocacy;



(d) evidence (but see para 3 above);



(e) conveyancing;



(f) probate;



(g) business accounts;



(h) solicitors&apos; accounts;



(i) the  management  of   a   legal   practice including

computerisation;



(j)   negotiation and communication skills in both non-



contentious and contentious matters;

(k)   lawyer-client   relations (communication,



counselling and advising);

(1)   drafting; and



(m)   professional  ethics  and conduct   (to  include the

codes proposed in Chapter 4).



Not every practitioner would need to cover all these

subjects: for instance, those marked with an asterisk

might be options. It will, of course, be for the

Advisory Committee to consider whether the suggested

subjects are appropriate. The Committee will also need

to consider the actual content of the courses and take

into account the fact that students wishing to cover

every option may need an extended period of

qualification.


CONFIDENTIAL



(iii) Practical and continuing stages

6. Proposals covering the practical and continuing stages



of training for advocacy are set out in Chapter 5. It

will be for the Advisory Committee in due course to

consider the practical and continuing stages of

training for other specialisms.

Present arrangements of the Bar and the Law Society

for handling complaints



Part 1; The Bar



Cases before the Professional Conduct Committee of the

General Council of the Bar (PCC)



The PCC consists of members of the Bar and a number of lay

members nominated by the Lord Chancellor.



(a) Informal procedure Where the conduct disclosed may be

dealt with informally, the PCC will inform the

barrister in writing of its views and may also direct

him to attend on the Chairman of the PCC or some other

person.



(b) Summary procedure This is under consideration but has

not been introduced. The proposal, however, is that, if

the PCC wished to take a matter further without

referring it to a Disciplinary Tribunal (see para 2

below) and there was no relevant dispute of fact, a

barrister would be afforded the opportunity to make

representations, in writing or in person, at a special

committee of the PCC, which would have the power to

administer an admonishment and reprimand or give advice

on future conduct.



Cases before a Disciplinary Tribunal



More serious cases or those where there is a relevant

dispute of fact are prosecuted by the PCC before a

Disciplinary Tribunal. A Tribunal is chaired by a Judge and

has four other members including one lay member. Less

serious cases relating to breach of professional standards

are treated in the same way as cases before the PCC. Where,

however,   a  charge  of  professional  misconduct  is proved,


CONFIDENTIAL



barristers may be ordered to repay or forego fees or may be

suspended or disbarred.



Hearing before the Visitors



Appeal from the Disciplinary Tribunal lies to not fewer than

three Judges of the High Court nominated by the Lord Chief

Justice after consultation with the Lord Chancellor and

known as the Visitors. There is no further internal appeal.



Part 2: The Law Society

The Solicitors&apos; Complaints Bureau



Complaints are first considered by the staff of the Bureau

who prepare the cases for further consideration or else

inform the complainant that there is no issue of conduct or

shoddy work. The Investigation Committee monitors the way

the Bureau handles complaints. The Adjudication Committee

exercises the Law Society&apos;s disciplinary and other relevant

powers.



(a) The Investigation Committee This has seven lay

members, including the Chairman, and four solicitor

members, two of whom are also Law Society Council

members. Its functions are:-



(i) to review cases going to the Adjudication

Committee and make recommendations for

further investigation, if it thinks it

necessary;



(ii) to review cases where the investigating

officer wishes to terminate an investigation,

but the complainant does not;



(iii) to review cases before a file is referred to

the Lay Observer and review reports of the

Lay Observer; and



2


CONFIDENTIAL



(iv) to make formal recommendations to the staff



for improvements in procedure.



(b) The Adjudication Committee This has nine Law Society

member8 including the Chairman, three other solicitors

and six lay members. It has a large number of powers

and in particular may:-



(i) take disciplinary proceedings against a

solicitor at the Solicitors&apos; Disciplinary

Tribunal;



(ii) rebuke solicitors;



(ill) discipline solicitors  for shoddy work, e.g.



order rectification of the mistake or the

remission of fees;



(iv) order an inspection of accounts;



(v) intervene in a practice to protect the

interests of a client;



(vi) impose conditions on a practising

certificate;



(vii) order payment of interest on a client&apos;s

money; and



(viii) order payments out of the compensation fund

when a person has suffered loss as a

consequence of a solicitor&apos;s dishonesty.



Solicitors&apos; Disciplinary Tribunal



3


CONFIDENTIAL



This Committee is established by statute and exercises the

delegated powers of the High Court. It considers the most

serious cases of professional misconduct. Complaints are

usually referred by the Solicitors&apos; Complaints Bureau, but

they may also be made direct by the public or in certain

cases by the Lay Observer. It normally sits with three

members, at least one of whom must be lay. The members are

appointed by the Master of the Rolls. It has powers to

strike off the roll, suspend, fine or reprimand.



6 The High Court



Appeal from the Solicitors&apos; Disciplinary Tribunal lies to

the High Court. In addition the High Court retains its

general supervisory jurisdiction over the profession.

Applications may be made direct to the High Court to cause a

solicitor to answer allegations.



7 The Lay Observer



He is an independent office-holder appointed by the Lord

Chancellor. Section 45(1) of the Solicitors Act 1974

empowers him to examine any written allegation made by or on

behalf of a member of the public concerning the Law

Society&apos;s treatment of a complaint about a solicitor or his

employee. The Lay Observer is only able to report on this

treatment and to make recommendations. He has no powers to

reinvestigate the complaint. When a complaint raises an

issue of both conduct and quality of services, he may, in

those circumstances only, make an application to the

Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal in respect of the quality

of services.

ANNEX  



Rights of audience In the courts of England and Wales



1 A litigant in person, that is a party to proceedings who is

not represented by a lawyer, has a right of audience in his

or her own cause in all courts and tribunals. A barrister

practising from chambers has a general right of audience on

behalf of his or her clients. The rights of audience of

solicitors in private practice are more limited. The rights

of audience of employed lawyers are more restricted still.

By virtue of the European Communities (Services of Lawyers)

Order 1978 (SI 1978 No.1910) an EC lawyer may appear before

any court, tribunal or public authority in the UK provided

that throughout the proceedings he or she is instructed

with, and acts in conjunction with, an advocate, barrister

or solicitor who is entitled to practise before the court

tribunal or public authority concerned and who could

properly provide the service in question.



The Magistrates&apos; Courts



2 The Magistrates&apos; Courts deal with around 90% of the total

criminal workload at first instance. They also deal with

care proceedings in respect of juveniles and licensing

applications, and have a sizeable domestic jurisdiction.

Decisions on both fact and law are taken either by a bench

of lay magistrates or by a stipendiary (legally qualified)

magistrate, sitting without a jury.



3 Rights of audience are governed by statute, currently s.122

of the Magistrates&apos; Courts Act 1980. This provision

derives from 8.2 of the Trials for Felony Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7

Will. 4, c. 114) enacted to reform the law following the

decision in Collier   Hicks (1831) 2   &amp; Ad. 663 in which

it was held that no person had a right to act as an advocate

on the trial of an information before justices of the peace


CONFIDENTIAL



without their permission. The Magistrates&apos; Courts Act 1980

8.122(1) provides that a party to any proceedings before a

magistrates&apos; court may be represented by counsel (i.e. a

barrister) or solicitor. In addition, various statutes such

as the Local Government Act 1972 8.223 and the Customs and

Excise Management Act 1979 8.155, give specified persons

authority to conduct particular prosecutions, although they

may not be counsel or solicitor. The Magistrates&apos; Court

also has a discretion to allow someone else to act on behalf

of either party to the proceedings.



The Crown Court



4 The main jurisdiction of the Crown Court is in criminal

proceedings. Apart from cases committed for trial from the

Magistrates&apos; Courts, the Crown Court deals with appeals from

the Magistrates&apos; Courts against conviction and sentence. It

also hears appeals from decisions of magistrates in care

proceedings in juvenile cases, appeals from the decisions of

justices in licensing matters and appeals from local

authorities and chief officers of police under various

statutes. The Crown Court has a small original civil

jurisdiction, such as applications under the Reservoirs

(Safety Provisions) Act 1930. In criminal cases, the court

is presided over by an Assistant Recorder, Recorder,

Circuit Judge or High Court Judge. In trials on not guilty

pleas the judge sits with a jury whose function it is to

decide whether the charge against the accused person has

been proved. Lay magistrates sit with the legally qualified

judges on some cases and appeals.



5 Barristers practising from chambers have a right of

audience in all cases in the Crown court. Rights of

audience for solicitors are governed by 8.83 of the Supreme

Court Act 1981 (reproducing the now repealed 8.12 of the

Courts Act 1971).    This provides as follows:-


CONFIDENTIAL



&quot;(1) The Lord Chancellor may at any time direct that

solicitors may appear in, conduct, defend and address

the court in any proceedings in the Crown Court, or

proceedings in the Crown Court of any description

specified in the direction.



(2) A direction under this section may have effect as

respects all places where the Crown Court sits, or as

respects a specified area, region or circuit, or as

respects one or more specified places where the Crown

Court sits.



(3) In considering whether to exercise his powers

under this section as respects any one or more

specified places where the Crown Court sits, the Lord

Chancellor shall have regard to any shortage of counsel

in the area in question, any rights of audience

formerly exercised by solicitors at any court of

quarter sessions in the locality in question, and to

any other circumstances affecting the public interest.



(4) Any direction given under this section may be

subject to such conditions and restrictions as appear

to the Lord Chancellor to be necessary or expedient.&quot;



By virtue of directions made by the Lord Chancellor on 7

December 1971, 9 February 1972 and 15 August 1988,

solicitors have rights of audience in:-



(a) appeals to the Crown Court from a Magistrates&apos;

Court or on committal for sentence, if the same

firm appeared in the court below;



(b)   civil proceedings in the Crown Court on appeal in

similar circumstances; and



(c) a limited number of cases in remote areas where

solicitors traditionally had full rights of

audience at Quarter Sessions (Caernarvon,

Barnstaple, Truro, Doncaster and parts of

Lincoln), which have been replaced by the Crown

Court.


CONFIDENTIAL



Rights of audience for Crown Prosecutors (barristers and

solicitors) employed by the Crown Prosecution Service are

governed by s.4 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.

This gives Crown Prosecutors the same rights of audience in

the Crown Court as solicitors holding practising

certificates; and the Lord Chancellor may give any such

directions under 8.83 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 in

respect of Crown Prosecutors as he could give in respect of

solicitors.



The County Courts



7 These courts have a wide-ranging civil jurisdiction in cases

where, generally speaking, the amount in issue does not

exceed  5,000, covering debt, breach of contract, personal

injury, recovery of land, bankruptcy and insolvency,

admiralty, family proceedings and miscellaneous matters such

as mental health and sex discrimination. Trials are heard

by Assistant Recorders, Recorders or Circuit Judges, and

interlocutory matters are heard by County Court Registrars.



8 Rights of audience in the County Court are governed by

sections 60 and 61 of the County Courts Act 1984. The

material part of s.60 is as follows:-



(1) In any proceedings in a county court any of the

following persons may address the court:-



(a) any party to the proceedings;



(b) a barrister retained by or on behalf of any

party;



(c) a solicitor acting generally in the

proceedings for a party to them (in this

subsection referred to as a ,solicitor on the

record1);



(d) any solicitor employed by a solicitor on the

record;



(e) any solicitor acting as an agent for a

solicitor on the record;



(f) any solicitor employed by a solicitor so

engaged; and



4


CONFIDENTIAL



(g)   any other  person allowed  by  leave  of the

court to appear instead of any party.



By virtue of 8.61 of the County Courts Act 1984, the Lord

Chancellor may by direction confer rights of audience in the

County Court on persons in employment consisting of or

Including giving assistance to solicitors in the conduct of

litigation. Only one such direction has been made to date

and that was in 1978 when this power was used to confer

rights of audience on Fellows of the Institute of Legal

Executives on behalf of their solicitor employer in

unopposed applications for an adjournment or applications

for judgments by consent.



The High Court



9 The High Court is divided into three Divisions: Chancery,

Queen&apos;s Bench, and Family. There is no upper limit on its

jurisdiction. It deals with a range of heavy civil work

covering matters such as debt, personal injury, land and

property, breach of contract, bankruptcy and companies

proceedings. In addition the High Court deals with public

law and various specialist cases, including patents. The

three Divisions of the High Court exercise appellate as well

as first instance jurisdiction: The Divisional Court of the

Chancery Division hears appeals in revenue matters from the

Commissioners of Taxes and bankruptcy matters from the

County Courts; the Queen&apos;s Bench Divisional Court

exercises appellate and supervisory jurisdiction over the

Crown Court (except in relation to the conduct of trials on

indictment), inferior courts and tribunals and the actions

and decisions of public bodies under the judicial review

procedure; the Divisional Court of the Family Division

hears appeals from Magistrates&apos; Courts in domestic matters.



10 The Chancery Division consists of the Lord Chancellor, who

is its president, the Vice-Chancellor and such of the High

Court judges as are for the time being attached to it. The



5


CONFIDENTIAL



Queen&apos;s Bench Division, which is much the largest, consists

of the Lord Chief Justice, who is its president, and such of

the High Court judges as are for the time being attached to

it. The Family Division consists of the President of the

Family Division and such of the High Court judges as are

for the time being attached to it. Apart from a few cases in

the Queen&apos;8 Bench Division, for example in some actions for

defamation, where juries sit to decide the facts, cases in

the High Court are heard by judges who sit alone and have to

make decisions on both the facts and the law. Interlocutory

matters are dealt with by Masters and District Registrars.



Subject to the 1978 Order mentioned above (para 1), rights

of audience in the High Court have not hitherto been

regulated by statute, but by the High Court judges acting as

a collegiate body (Abse   Smith [1986] 1 QB, 536). It is

an established rule that, save in an emergency, a solicitor

cannot appear on his client&apos;s behalf in open court.

According to long custom, barristers have a general right of

audience in the High Court, whereas solicitors do not.

Solicitors do have a general right of audience in the High

Court when sitting in chambers, whether before a judge or

Master, which extends to their responsible representatives

(such as legal executives).   Solicitors may also appear in:-



(a) bankruptcy matters, and



(b) formal or unopposed matters where there is

unlikely to be any argument and where the court

will not be called upon to exercise any

discretion.



A solicitor may also represent his client in the Supreme

Court when judgment is delivered in open court following a

hearing in chambers at which that solicitor conducted the

case for the client (Practice Direction: Solicitors: Rights

of   Audience)   [1986]   1   W.L.R.545   issued   by   the Lord


CONFIDENTIAL



Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls

and the President of the Family Division.



The Court of Appeal



12 The Court of Appeal 18 divided into the Criminal Division

and the Civil Division. The judges of the Court of Appeal

are the Lord Chief Justice, who is the president of the

Criminal Division, and the Master of the Rolls, who is the

president of the Civil Division, together with 27 Lords

Justices of Appeal. The President of the Family Division

and the Vice-Chancellor also sit in the Court of Appeal for

part of their time. The Court of Appeal normally sits in a

bench of two or three.



13 The Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal hears appeals

against conviction and sentence from the Crown Court in

England and Wales. In 1987 the number of applications and

appeals registered was 8,320 - a rise of 8% over the number

registered in 1986. Courts in the Criminal Division are

constituted from the Lord Chief Justice and the Lords

Justices assisted by judges of the Queen&apos;s Bench Division of

the High Court as required. There are no juries.



14 The Civil Division of the Court of Appeal hears appeals

from the High Court in civil matters, the County Courts, and

various tribunals. Courts in this Division are normally

constituted from the Master of the Rolls and the Lords

Justices.



15 Rights of audience in both Divisions are governed by the

judges of the Court of Appeal acting as a collegiate body

(Abse   Smith above). The position on rights of audience

18 the same as that in   the High Court.



The House of Lords


CONFIDENTIAL



16 The House of Lords in its judicial capacity is the supreme

court of appeal in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It

adjudicates on matters of law of general public importance.

The main judges of the House of Lords are the Lord

Chancellor and the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. An appeal

lies to the House of Lords:-



(a) from any order or judgment of the Court of Appeal

in England, by leave of that court or the House of

Lords, subject to restrictions imposed by statute

or by practice in specific matters;



(b) from any order or judgment of any court in

Scotland from which error or appeal lay on or

before 1 November 1876 by common law or by

statute;



(c) subject to statutory restrictions, in exceptional

cases direct from a decision of the High Court in

England;



(d) from any order or judgment of the Court of Appeal

in Northern Ireland by leave of that court or the

House of Lords, subject to statutory restrictions;

and



(e) subject to statutory restrictions, in exceptional

cases direct from decisions of the High Court of

Justice in Northern Ireland.



17 Rights of audience are the same as in the High Court and the

Court of Appeal. In addition, Scottish advocates and

barristers from Northern Ireland have rights of audience and

solicitors may appear before the Appeal Committee of the

House of Lords when it is considering a petition for leave

to appeal.



The Judicial Co ittee of the Privy Council



18 The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final

court  of  appeal   for  those Commonwealth countries which



8


CONFIDENTIAL



V. retain the right of appeal to Her Majesty in Council. Its

members are normally drawn from among the Lord Chancellor

and the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. In its domestic

jurisdiction, the Committee entertains appeals against

schemes by the Church Commissioners under the Pastoral

Measure Act 1983. The Committee also hears appeals from

their disciplinary bodies by doctors, dentists, opticians,

veterinary surgeons and members of professions supplementary

to medicine; it also hears appeals in prize cases during and

after a period of hostilities. Rights of audience, which

are governed by custom and not statute, extend to English

and Northern Ireland barristers, Scottish advocates and all

advocates duly qualified in countries from which appeals lie

to the Queen in Council.



The rights of audience of employed lawyers



19 Solicitors employed by non-legal employers, who either hold

or are exempted from holding practising certificates, have

the same rights of audience on behalf of their employer as

solicitors in private practice.



20 The rights of audience of employed barristers are currently

more restricted than the rights of employed solicitors. For

instance, employed barristers are presently allowed to

appear as advocates for their employers in the Magistrates&apos;

Court and the County Court only if they are given leave to

do so by the court. Employed solicitors, on the other hand,

can appear in these courts as of right. This anomaly is the

result of the combined effect of the wording of 8.122(1) of

the Magistrates&apos; Courts Act 1980 and 8.60(1) of the County

Courts Act 1984 and the provisions of the Third Edition of

the Bar&apos;s Code of Conduct which deny to employed barristers

the status of counsel. It will be removed by the provisions

of the Fourth Edition of the Bar&apos;s Code of Conduct (due to

come into force on 1 February 1989) which will enable an

employed barrister to appear on behalf of his employer as



9


CONFIDENTIAL



counsel In circumstances where barristers in general

practice do not have an exclusive right of audience. This

alteration to the Code should also enable employed

barristers to appear in the same instances as employed

solicitors in the High Court, Court of Appeal and House of

Lords .



21 Employed lawyers do not have rights of audience in the

Crown Court. This 18 the result of the combined effect of

the provisions of 8.83 of the Supreme Court Act 1981, the

current Directions made by the Lord Chancellor and

professional practice rules.



Tribunals



22 At present, there are generally no restrictions on rights of

audience before tribunals. This is because, as recognised by

the Report of the Committee on Administrative Tribunals and

Enquiries (1957 Cmnd. 218), the main characteristics of

tribunals are, &quot;cheapness, accessibility, freedom from

technicality, expedition and expert knowledge of their

particular subject.&quot; (para 38). Because of these

characteristics it is generally considered that most

applicants should be able to cope with bringing proceedings

without the need for assistance from a qualified legal

representative. Assistance may, however, be available from

other sources; for instance, trade unions and CABx often

represent employees before Industrial Tribunals and also

represent applicants before the Criminal Injuries

Compensation Board. CABx are also playing an increasing

role in representing applicants before Mental Health Review

Tribunals.

CONFIDENTIAL



CHAPTER 1 ? INTRODUCTION



1.1 The Government proposes to legislate to permit a

simpler system to be implemented for banks, building

societies, other institutions and Individuals to

provide conveyancing services to clients subject to

appropriate safeguards. There is legislative provision

for a system of this kind in Schedule 21 to the

Building Societies Act 1986, but this Schedule has not

been implemented. The Government now wishes to

substitute an alternative statutory framework which

will be less elaborate than that envisaged in

Schedule 21 to the 1986 Act but which will still

provide the necessary controls. These proposals will

affect only England and Wales.



1.2 The new system will provide for the authorisation of

practitioners who will be able to offer conveyancing

services to the public. The identity of the

practitioners may vary but they will all be required to

comply with a set of strict conditions. These will

include abiding by a code of conduct and employing

sufficient solicitors or licensed conveyancers to

supervise or provide the conveyancing services.



1.3 There will be no prohibition against lending

institutions providing conveyancing services to their

borrowers. The Government is, however, concerned to see

that the many Independent solicitors and licensed

conveyancers throughout the country can compete with

such institutions on a fair basis. It therefore invites

views on whether authorised practitioners might be

required not to subsidise the provision of conveyancing

services   from   their   other   activities.   The same



1


CONFIDENTIAL



requirement could be placed also upon existing

Independent solicitors and licensed conveyancers 80 as

to ensure a level playing field for all. The

Government would welcome comment on whether this could

be achieved, if it was provided that, in order to

remain authorised, authorised practitioners had to:-



(a) offer   conveyancing   services   at   not   less than

their true cost; and



(b) be able to prove that they were doing this to the

satisfaction of their auditors.



It is also for consideration whether any authorised

practitioner, who was a lending institution which had

offered to add the cost of the conveyancing transaction

to the loan, should be required to do this, whether the

client chose to use that authorised practitioner or an

independent conveyancer to carry out the conveyancing

transaction.



Views are therefore Invited on whether suitable

detailed arrangements could be made to give effect to

these proposals.



1.4 It follows from this that there would also appear no



longer to be any reason to prevent lending institutions

or other potential authorised practitioners from having

a shareholding in incorporated licensed conveyancers&apos;

practices, when these come into being, since such

companies will be required to abide by the relevant

professional rules of conduct of the Council for

Licensed Conveyancers. At present such a shareholding

18 prohibited by the rules of the Council, but, if the

Government in due course confirms its intention to

adopt the proposals set out in this paper, the Council



2


CONFIDENTIAL



may wish to consider amending accordingly its approach

to incorporated practices. The Law Society also might

wish in the light of this to review its policy on

outside shareholdings. Arrangements linking solicitors

and others are considered in Chapter 12 of the Green

Paper on the Work and Organisation of the Legal

Profession which is published today.



3


CONFIDENTIAL



CHAPTER 2 - BACKGROUND



2.1 At the beginning of the nineteenth century it appears

that there was nothing to prevent anyone at all from

setting up as a conveyancer, but in 1804 the

legislature made conveyancing the monopoly of the legal

profession. At that time there was a considerable

number of branches of the legal profession, but most

have since dwindled away. Statutory provisions giving

the legal profession a monopoly over conveyancing were

last re-enacted in the Solicitors Act 1974. Section 22

provided that only solicitors and certain other

excepted categories could draft conveyancing documents

for reward;    and in practice solicitors had the work to

themselves.



2.2 In 1983 the Government decided that the existing

restrictions should be modified in order to stimulate

competition. It was argued that the solicitors&apos;

monopoly was wrong, that their costs were too high and

that it was not necessary to be a solicitor to draft

conveyancing documents. The Government therefore began

the process which led to the establishment, by the

Administration of Justice Act 1985, of the new

profession of licensed conveyancers, who are able to

provide conveyancing services in competition with

solicitors. In addition in December 1983 the Solicitor

General announced that the Government intended to

introduce legislation to extend the right of

conveyancing to solicitors employed by banks and

building societies, subject to safeguards.



2.3 The declared policy was set out by the Solicitor



1


CONFIDENTIAL



General In a written answer on 6 December 1985, when he

replied to Mr Forsyth MP.



&quot;The Government issued a consultation paper last

year seeking views on the way in which conflicts

of interest and anti-competitive practices could

be avoided if building societies and other

financial institutions were to offer conveyancing

services to the public. Following that

consultation, the Government have concluded that

there is no difficulty in principle in such

institutions providing conveyancing to persons to

whom they are not also offering a loan. However,

the Government are not satisfied that lending

institutions could safely be permitted to offer

both conveyancing and a loan in the same

transaction. It is therefore proposed to prohibit

lending institutions from providing conveyancing,

either directly or through a subsidiary company in

which they hold a majority stake, to those who are

also borrowing from them.



&quot;The Government are also examining the possibility

of estate agents providing a combined service of

sale and conveyancing to vendors, and of lending

institutions providing conveyancing to borrowers

from them through associated companies in which

the lender holds only a minority shareholding.

Consultation on those matters is not yet complete.



&quot;It is also proposed to set a number of other

conditions to ensure proper consumer protection.

In particular, institutions will be required to

ensure that their conveyancing work is supervised

by a qualified person; and adequate arrangements

will have to be made to protect the consumer



2


CONFIDENTIAL



against negligence or fraud on the part of those

providing the service&quot;.



2.4 The necessary statutory provisions were placed in

section 124 of and Schedule 21 to the Building

Societies Act 1986, although these provisions have not

been implemented. They allow the Lord Chancellor to

recognise institutions - which are defined as &quot;any

building society or other body corporate or any

unincorporated association&quot; - and individual

practitioners as suitable to undertake the provision of

conveyancing services. Recognised institutions and

practitioners are exempt from section 22 of the

Solicitors Act 1974. In addition recognised

institutions which happen to be bodies corporate are

also exempt from section 24 of the 1974 Act which

prohibits bodies corporate from providing conveyancing

services.



2.5 The Lord Chancellor was given extensive rule-making

powers, in order that he might control these new

conveyancers. He may make rules to prescribe the

circumstances in which institutions and practitioners

may be recognised and the conditions which must be met

in order that such recognition may continue (paragraph

2(1) of Schedule 21). He may prescribe appropriate

conditions for protecting persons for whom conveyancing

services are provided from conflicts of interest

(paragraph 2(2)(a)) and for securing that compensation

is payable to such persons in respect of negligence,

fraud or other dishonesty (paragraph 2 (2)(b)). The

Schedule also permits the Lord Chancellor to make rules

for the manner, form, period and revocation of

recognition on specified grounds, (paragraph 3); for

the keeping of a list of recognised institutions or

practitioners (paragraph 4) and for the delegation of



3


CONFIDENTIAL



all the Lord Chancellor&apos;s functions (except for rule

making) to any officer or officers nominated by the

rules (paragraph 5). All recognition rules are to be

made by statutory instrument.



2.6 The Schedule clearly envisages that the Lord Chancellor

will:-



(a) provide an elaborate structure of rules and

guidelines to govern the conduct of recognised

institutions and practitioners; and



(b) set up administrative machinery which will oversee

the granting of recognition, ensure that the rules

are observed and, where necessary, will revoke

recognition or impose disciplinary sanctions.



2.7 The justification for such a structure would be that

there would be insufficient protection and control

without it. The Government, however, now considers

that adequate alternative machinery could be set up

bearing in mind that:-



(a) those organisations and individuals who are most

likely to seek and obtain recognition are already

regulated by statute and/or professional bodies;

and



(b) there will be a requirement that those who carry

out or supervise the conveyancing services must be

solicitors or licensed conveyancers.

CONFIDENTIAL

CHAPTER 3 - THE NEW APPROACH



(A.) The provision of conveyancing service  by employees of



lending institutions



3.1 Government policy as stated in 1985 was to prohibit

lending institutions from providing conveyancing

services, either directly or through a Company in which

they had a majority shareholding, to those who were

also borrowing from them.    The prohibition was the

result of unresolved concerns over conflicts of

interest which might arise if a solicitor or licensed

conveyancer employed by a lending institution acted

both for the institution and the borrower. The

conflict would be between the solicitor&apos;s duty to his

employer and the duty to the borrower, who would be his

client.    Such conflicts could arise where the borrower

revealed something to the solicitor or licensed

conveyancer which might reduce his chances of obtaining

a loan.    It was considered that the solicitor or

licensed conveyancer might also be in difficulty in

giving independent advice about the type of mortgage

which would be required and the conditions of the

loan.



3.2 The Government no longer thinks it necessary to follow

the policy it announced in 1985.    It now believes that,

although the conflicts of interest outlined in

paragraph 2.1 above might arise very occasionally,

nevertheless adequate safeguards can be devised and, in

the vast majority of cases, the interests of the

borrower and the lender in the conveyancing transaction

will be identical.    Indeed, at present the same

solicitors and licensed conveyancers frequently act for

both the lending institution and the borrower. For

years lending institutions have been willing to use the



1


CONFIDENTIAL



same solicitor (and are now willing to use the same

licensed conveyancer) as the customer at a significant

saving to him. The added risk of a conflict of Interest

where the conveyancer is actually employed by the

lending institution appears to be a matter of degree

rather than substance and to be relevant only in

exceptional circumstances.



3.3 The Government therefore does not consider that the

risks are large enough to outweigh the potential

benefits of a more relaxed approach, provided that

there are sufficient safeguards to offer the borrower

an informed choice.    These safeguards will be

incorporated in the Code of Conduct proposed in

paragraph 3.9.   A few will be specific to lending

institutions - and, it should be pointed out, to any

insurance company which might wish to provide

conveyancing services to someone taking out an

endowment mortgage.   Others will be generally

applicable to all authorised practitioners.    On this

basis the Government proposes to allow solicitors and

licensed conveyancers employed by lending institutions

to undertake conveyancing work on behalf of their

employers ? clients.



(B.) Authorised practitioners



3.4 The Lord Chancellor no longer intends that he will

consider individual applications from those who wish to

provide conveyancing services to the public. Instead

he proposes to set out a number of requirements which

any person, whether an individual, a partnership or a

corporate body, must meet before it will be allowed to

provide conveyancing services.   All those who meet such

requirements will be known as authorised practitioners.



2


CONFIDENTIAL

Requirements for authorisation



3.5 To obtain authorisation the individual practitioner

will have to satisfy the requirements set in the

following areas:



(i) Suitability to provide conveyancing services



3.6 The practitioner must be fit and proper or be a

business which is run by fit and proper people,

conducting the business in a prudent and competent

manner.    Practitioners must also have the experience

and competence to provide these additional services.

This means that practitioners must either be authorised

under statute, like banks or building societies, or

obtain authorisation by a recognised authority as

indicated in paragraph 3.18. below.



(ii) Employment of a sufficient number of solicitors or

licensed conveyancers (or both) to provide or supervise

the provision of the conveyancing services



3.7 Although an authorised practitioner will be exempt from

section 22 of the Solicitors Act 1974, it will remain a

requirement that the conveyancing work must be carried

out by those who have the relevant professional

expertise.



(iii) Protection of clients&apos; money from improper use



3.8 In order to reduce the risk of dishonesty or the

improper use of clients&apos; money, such money must be paid

into separate clients&apos; accounts.    In addition, in cases

where money is held by an authorised practitioner on

behalf of a client, he must place it on deposit and pay

the client the interest earned.



3

(iv) Compliance with the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Code of Conduct



3.9 The Lord Chancellor intends to lay down in a statutory

instrument a Code of Conduct to be followed by all

authorised practitioners.    This will Impose uniform

minimum standards on them and provide a measure against

which complaints should be judged.    The main principles

which the Government proposes should be covered are

contained in the Annex to this paper.



(v) Ability to meet claims arising out of conveyancing

services



3.10 There will inevitably be claims of financial loss

arising out of the provision of conveyancing services.

A bad mistake can result in a purchaser acquiring a

property which is worth considerably less than he paid

for it - because, for example, the conveyancer

overlooked a restriction on use or the planning of a

new motorway.    The practitioner will be required to

have adequate professional indemnity insurance or other

appropriate arrangements to meet such claims.



(vi) Investigation of complaints



3.11 The authorised practitioner must be able to

demonstrate, where appropriate to the satisfaction of

the relevant recognised authority (see para 3.18

below), that it has suitable internal mechanisms in

place, appropriate to the nature and scale of its

organisation, to deal with complaints and disciplinary

matters.



(vil) Suitable compensation arrangements



4


CONFIDENTIAL



3.12 It 18 not possible for anyone to insure against his own

dishonesty.    There will inevitably be cases where loss

18 caused by the dishonesty of the practitioner or, in

the case of a corporate body, by its directors. The

practitioner will therefore be required to be covered

by a suitable compensation scheme or to have made

adequate bonding arrangements.



(viii)       Membership of a suitable ombudsman scheme



3.13 There will be cases where an aggrieved client is either

not satisfied about the way the practitioner dealt with

his complaint or wishes to complain about possible

breaches of the Code of Conduct by the practitioner.

Every authorised practitioner will therefore be

required to belong to a suitable ombudsman scheme which

provides for an independent adjudicator who must at

least have powers to:-



(a) investigate the complaint provided it is within a

reasonable period of time and is not vexatious or

frivolous;



(b) require production of documents;



(c) order the authorised practitioner to pay the

complainant compensation for the loss, expense or

inconvenience caused by the action;



(d) direct the authorised practitioner to take action

to correct the complaint (this could include

suspending the taking on of new business for a

fixed period or until the problems have been

remedied);



5


CONFIDENTIAL



(e) require a practitioner to abide by hie ruling

within a specified period as a condition of

membership of the scheme (in practice, this means

that the practitioner will either have to accept

the ruling or resign from the scheme, thereby

disqualifying himself or itself from

authorisation); and



(f) report to the relevant recognised or other

supervisory authority where a complaint against an

authorised practitioner reveals a persistent

breach of the code of conduct or a systemic fault.



business for any number of reasons including death,

illness, disciplinary action or bankruptcy.    In the

case of solicitors and licensed conveyancers who cease

practice, there are statutory provisions whereby

clients&apos; money is protected, and professional

colleagues may intervene in the practice in order to

return papers to clients.   Very often the intervening

colleague is willing to take over the file of any

client prepared to instruct him.    Similar arrangements

will be required in the case of authorised

practitioners so that clients are properly protected.



(ix)



Adequate arrangements for protecting clients

should an authorised practitioner cease

providing conveyancing services.



3.14



An authorised practitioner may cease, or go out of,



(C.) Obtaining authorisation



3.15



Those who may wish to become authorised practitioners

may be divided into two categories.



(i)   Banks and Buildings Societies



6


CONFIDENTIAL



3.16 These businesses are already regulated and subject to

prudential regulation:-



(a) Banks   An Institution wishing to operate a

deposit taking business  ust be authorised by the

Bank of England under the Banking Act 1987; and



(b) Building Societies   No building society may raise

money from its members unless it is authorised to

do so by the Building Societies Commission under

the Building Societies Act 1986.



3.17 No bank or building society is authorised unless it 18

established that it 18 run by fit and proper persons in

a prudent manner.    Accordingly the Government believes

that all banks and building societies should be allowed

to operate as authorised practitioners provided they

certify to their regulatory authorities that they can

comply with all the other requirements set out in

paragraphs 3.7 to 3.14.



(ii) Others



3.18 Others wishing to become authorised practitioners will

be required to submit themselves to the supervision of

an authority which can satisfy the Lord Chancellor that

it is able to impose and enforce the necessary

requirements set out in this paper.    Such authorities

will be known as recognised authorities. Some

intending practitioners, such as surveyors, valuers and

insurance brokers, may already be regulated by

authorities which will easily be able to enforce the

relevant new requirements.   Others, like estate agents

and the new mortgage lending companies, may find it

necessary to set up new authorities or, if they wish, a



7


CONFIDENTIAL



single new authority, with a single ombudsman scheme.

Indeed, although there will be no statutory requirement

to this effect, all authorised practitioners, however

regulated, might find it sensible to set up a single

ombudsman scheme rather than finance a number of

separate schemes.

CHAPTER 4 - SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS



4.1 In summary, the Government therefore proposes:-



(a) to repeal section 124 of and Schedule 21 to the

Building Societies Act 1986; and



(b) to Introduce legislation which will provide for

the authorisation of practitioners who can satisfy

the requirements set out In paragraphs 3.6 to 3.14

of this Paper.



4.2 The Government would welcome comments on these

proposals.    They should be sent to arrive not later

than 2 May 1989 to:-



Room 417

CONFIDENTIAL



ANNEX



PROPOSED CODE OF CONDUCT:    MAIN PRINCIPLES

(A.) Proper supervision of conveyancing services



1. One individual must be responsible for the direction and

supervision of the conveyancing services.



Each authorised practitioner must have one named person,

who is directly responsible for ensuring that the

conveyancing services are carried out according to this

code.



2. A sufficient number of solicitors or licensed conveyancers

(or both) must be employed to enable the conveyancing

services to be provided by suitably qualified persons or

under their immediate supervision.



As explained in paragraph 3.7 of the paper, it will remain a

requirement that the conveyancing work must be carried out

by those who have the relevant professional expertise.



(B.) Conflicts of interest



3. Subparagraphs (a) and (b) below will apply in any case where

the authorised practitioner Is a lending institution (or is

a subsidiary of a lending institution) and wishes to provide

conveyancing services for any person to whom the lending

institution has lent or Is proposing to lend money which was

or is to be applied in or towards the acquisition of an

estate or interest in land.    The authorised practitioner

must:-



1


CONFIDENTIAL



(a) make it clear that independent financial advice is

not available from the conveyancer; and



(b) explain the terms and conditions of the loan or

offer in a clear and straightforward manner?



A conveyancer employed by a lending institution (or by an

insurance company providing an endowment policy) would not

be able to give independent advice, but in this he would be

no different to tied agents in other financial markets. The

vital consideration is that the borrower understands this.

As long as he does, he will still have the option of

seeking independent legal advice about alternative

financial packages.    It is worth pointing out, however, that

under the current system it seems clear that a significant

proportion of home buyers do not approach their conveyancers

until they have arranged their mortgage, and do not

therefore   look to them for financial advice.



The client must be made specifically aware that information

disclosed by the client to the conveyancer may be used by

the authorised practitioner in respect of any other service

it is providing or intends to provide.



An independent conveyancer would have a duty of confidence

to the client.    However, an employed conveyancer would also

have a duty to his employer and must make it clear to the

client that no relevant information disclosed can be kept

from the employer.    Such information could therefore be used

by a lending institution in assessing a borrower&apos;s

suitability for a loan or by a firm of surveyors in

assessing whether the client will be able to pay for an

expensive structural survey.


^ CONFIDENTIAL



5. (a) A recognised practitioner must not provide conveyancing

services in any case where the interests of the practitioner

or any associate of the practitioner may conflict with those

of the person making use of the services.



(b) &quot;Associate&quot; in sub-paragraph (a) would cover partners,

subsidiary or holding companies, companies of which the

practitioner is a director and, where the practitioner is an

individual, any members of his family.



Clients need to be protected from situations where the

interests of the authorised practitioner put at risk his

duties to the client.   The obvious example is where the

practitioner has a direct financial interest because it owns

or is seeking to buy the property in question.    Principles 6

and 7 below are particular examples of where conflict is

likely to arise and where, subject to certain safeguards,

it may be considered that a potential conflict can be

regarded as overcome.



6. (a)   An authorised practitioner must not accept instructions

from or continue to act for   any person whose interests

conflict with those of any other person by whom the

authorised practitioner is also instructed.



(b)    In particular an authorised practitioner must not act

for both parties to a transaction except where it appears

that there is no conflict of interest between the parties

and both have consented in writing



(1) to its acting; and



(ii) to its ceasing to act for both parties,

shoulda conflict of interest subsequently arise.



3


CONFIDENTIAL



Subparagraph (a) 18 a broad statement of principle. It

would cover not only acting for both parties, but also a

situation where the vendor (V) is selling to purchaser one

(PI) who is selling to purchaser two (P2) and the authorised

practitioner is instructed by V and P2.   Although a conflict

may be unlikely, the practitioner needs to be aware that it

could arise.



Subparagraph (b) is specifically directed at acting for both

vendor and purchaser.    It follows the approach of the

Licensed Conveyancers Practice Rules which permit licensed

conveyancers to act for both parties on these very stringent

conditions.



One obvious example of where a conflict may arise is where

an estate agent acting on behalf of a vendor wishes to

provide conveyancing services for both vendor and purchaser.



A particular problem which will need to be sorted out when

the relevant rules come to be drafted is how to deal with

authorised practitioners who have more than one office.

This is obviously the case with most lending institutions.

It may be safe to provide that In most cases where one

branch office acts for the vendor and another for the

purchaser each office may be treated as a separate

practitioner, but equally there may need to be provisions

which ensure that they act independently of one another.



7.     When the authorised practitioner enters into an arrangement

with another person for the introduction of clients to the

authorised practitioner or by the authorised practitioner to

the other person it must ensure:-



(a) that the client is informed in writing of the

arrangement and of any commission or other benefit the

authorised practitioner may be receiving or pay;



4


CONFIDENTIAL



(b) that It obtains the client&apos;s written agreement as

to the destination of the commission or else it shall

account to the client for the commission? and



(c) that it remains able to advise the client

regardless of its own interests.



A client must be entitled to know whether the authorised

practitioner is making any hidden profit or is paying any

third party who referred the client to the authorised

practitioner.



(C.) Contractual obligations



8.     An authorised practitioner must give to each client, before

it may accept instructions to act, an estimate of the total

cost which the client will or may have to meet.    This must

set out



(a) the way in which fees will be calculated;



(b) the circumstances in which they might be increased;

and



(c) the particulars of expenses and tax likely to be

charged to the client



Clients must be entitled to know before they enter into a

contract with the authorised practitioner what the likely

cost of the transaction will be.



When the authorised practitioner 18 a lending institution

and offers to add the cost of the conveyancing transaction

to the loan, it must give the client an indication of what

he 18 likely to pay over the period of the loan compared to



5


CONFIDENTIAL



what he would pay if he net the cost on completion. Any such

lending institution, which has offered to add the cost of

the conveyancing transaction to the loan, must also be ready

to do this, whether the client chooses to use that lending

Institution or an independent conveyancer to carry out the

conveyancing transaction.



9. When an authorised practitioner offers conveyancing and

other services to a client it must ensure that the statement

required under Principle 8 sets out separately the cost of

each service.



The client needs to be able to make an informed choice

between the cost of in-house and independent conveyancing

services.



10. Authorised practitioners must not offer conveyancing

services below their true cost and must provide annual proof

that they are complying with this requirement



The Government is anxious to ensure that the competitive

position of independent conveyancers is not put at risk by

authorised practitioners subsidising the provision of

conveyancing services by their other activities. It

therefore requires authorised practitioners not to offer

conveyancing services below their true cost. Authorised

practitioners must be able to demonstrate this at least once

a year to the satisfaction of their auditors who must

certify that this condition is being met.



11. An authorised practitioner must not make the provision of;-



(a) conveyancing services conditional on any other

service being taken; or



6


CONFIDENTIAL



(b) any other service conditional on conveyancing



services being taken.



Such a prohibition against &quot;tying-in&quot; is essential. There

is an obvious risk that, for example, a lending institution

will tie in the conveyancing services to the loan, thus

making the borrower accept the whole package.    Since the

loan is so vital, this would effectively prevent the

borrower from seeking independent legal or financial advice.

Similarly, although the client would feel under less

pressure to accept, a surveyor might wish   a client to

accept a combined estate agency/survey/conveyancing package.

If this were permitted, it might well force independent

conveyancers out of business and so reduce competition.



12. An authorised practitioner must not contractually limit its

liability for damage suffered by the client as a result of

negligence on its part.



13. An authorised practitioner must set out in writing the terms

upon which instructions will be accepted and give them to

the client before accepting instructions.



(D.)    Conduct of business



14. An authorised practitioner must deal with correspondence and

other matters arising in the course of a conveyancing

transaction with reasonable speed and must not by his

actions or omissions cause unnecessary delay.



Authorised practitioners will be required to act in a

professional manner.    These purpose of this and the

following principles is to ensure that this happens. These

principles will:-



7


CONFIDENTIAL



(a) help to avoid any conflict between the authorised

practitioner and the employed professional

conveyancer by imposing the same rules of conduct

as the professional conveyancer would expect to

meet in private practice;



(b) demonstrate to independent conveyancers acting for

other parties that authorised practitioners are

not exempt from the usual professional standards;

and



(c) offer guidance to ombudsmen and other interested

parties in the case of complaints.



15.    An authorised practitioner must ensure that clients are kept

adequately informed of the progress of the transaction.



Failing to keep clients properly informed causes

misunderstanding and anxiety.    It leads to mistakes and

complaints.



15.   An authorised practitioner must treat all facts and



information concerning the client obtained by it in the

course of acting for the client as confidential and must not

at any time make any unauthorised use of such facts or

information.



17. An authorised practitioner must not delay completion of any

transaction solely on the ground that its fees are

outstanding.



18. An authorised practitioner must comply fully with every

undertaking given on its behalf during any conveyancing

transaction.



8


CONFIDENTIAL



19. When an authorised practitioner 18 instructed by a vendor to

submit forms of contract to more than one prospective

purchaser, it must obtain the client&apos;s authority to disclose

this fact to all prospective purchasers.    If that authority

is not given, it must withdraw from the transactions.



20. An authorised practitioner must not withdraw from

transactions without good cause.



An authorised practitioner must not cease to act merely

because it no longer wishes to represent a client. There

should be a good reason for its withdrawing, for example

because a conflict of Interest 18 discovered or the

authorised practitioner is unable to obtain instructions

from the client.
