9. As to financing, the cost of the awards by the Top Salaries

Review Body and the Armed Forces Pay^ Review Body can be afforded

}within current provision. The awards for the NHS groups would involve

cost of  248m in excess of current provision, after allowing for the

itement for consultants described in paragraph 8.  62m of this is

tthe Family Practioner Service, and falls on the Reserve. Of the

cost falling on the Hospital and Community Health Services,  44m

1 be met from within the NHS, with the remaining  142m coming from

^erve. Last year the Government met the excess cost of the

iody awards in full, and Ministers thought it important to

esta1$^2^l the principle that this would not necessarily happen every

year.

Medicine, the Doctors and Dentists, and the Armed Forces, and of the

Top Salaries Review Body, have been published today. Copies are now

of the review bodies for these reports and the time and care which

they have put into their preparation.

which count as public expenditure. The figure for doctors and

dentists includes payments for GPs? expenses, not counted as pay.

The figure for nurses includes  5m for the flexible pay experi-

educational   grades,   which  the  Review  Body  has   not   yet costed.

eligible for discretionary increments. The figure for the pay

bill increase does however allow for this. The figure given for

the range of increases also excludes restructuring for 13

Immigration Adjudicators who receive increases of 27.1%, and for

the Chief Immigration Adjudicator and the Vice-Presidents of the

Immigration Appeal Tribunal, who get 28.3%.

The Government have decided to accept in full the Review bodies&apos;

recommendations on the armed forces, on professions allied to medi-

cine, and on nursing staff, midwives and health visitors.



The Government have also decided to accept the recommendation of

the review body on doctors and dentists for a basic increase of 8% for

all the groups covered. In the Government&apos;s view the creation of 100

additional permanent consultant posts over the next 3 years, as

proposed in the White Paper, &quot;Working for Patients&quot;, will best achieve

the objective of improving the long-term career structure for hospital

doctors. The creation of these posts will therefore take the place of

the increases recommended, in addition to the 8% basic increase, at

the top of the consultants&apos; scale and in the size of consultants&apos;

distinction awards. Subject to this, the Government accepts the

Review Body&apos;s recommendations.



The Government have decided to accept the recommendations of the

Top Salaries Review Body in full, except that they consider that the

pay of 2-star officers should be around 85% of the normally attainable

maximum of Grade 2 civil servants (which is also the pay point for

3-star officers) rather than linked to a performance point for Grade 3

civil servants. This would give the 2-star officer a salary at the

level recommended by the TSRB.



The full cost of the awards by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body

and Top Salaries Review Body groups will be met from within existing

public expenditure programme totals for this year. In the case of the

health services however the Government recognise that the full costs

could not be accommodated without adversely affecting services to

patients. The Government have therefore decided to provide an extra

 142m for health authority cash limits from the Reserve for next year.

Of the remaining cost,  417m is already fully covered within the

allocations made for this year, leaving a balance of  44m to be

covered from cost improvements. The Government have similarly decided

to provide an additional  62m to the Family Practitioner Services from

the Reserve for this year. Together with the increases in allocation

already announced, the increase in provision for the National Health

Service in 1989-90 over 1988-89 will therefore be  1899m.



The pay rates and scales resulting from the decisions will be

promulgated   as   soon   as   possible   for   all   the   groups concerned.

Question : To ask the Secretary of State for Education and

Science, when the second Report of the Interim Advisory Committee

on School Teachers&apos;  Pay and Conditions will be published.



Answer :



MR KENNETH BAKER



It is being published today.    Its main recommendations are



a 6% increase in the main pay scale for

teachers from 1 April 1989



a 7% increase in the value of the five rates

of incentive allowances from 1 April 1989



a 7.5% increase in the salaries of the 55,000

Heads and Deputies from 1 April 1989



an extra 9,500 incentive allowances for the

1989-90 academic year, on top of the

additional 18,000 already planned



a 5.6% increase in London allowances from 1

July 1988.



I propose to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendations in full. I

am today initiating the consultation required by Section 3(1) of

the Teachers&apos; Pay and Conditions Act 1987 by writing to the

relevant local authority associations, teacher unions and bodies

representing the interests of the governors of voluntary

schools, setting out my proposals.    The text of the letter is as

follows:

LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE TO

THE RELEVANT LOCAL AUTHORITY ASSOCIATIONS,  TEACHER UNIONS AND

BODIES REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF THE GOVERNORS OF VOLUNTARY

SCHOOLS



TEACHERS PAY AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT



1. On 14 September 1988 I asked the Interim Advisory Committee

on School Teachers Pay and Conditions to examine and report to me

on certain issues.    I enclose a copy of the Committee&apos;s report

which is being published today.    The Committee&apos;s recommendations

are summarised in Chapter 9 of its report.    I propose to make an

Order giving effect to the recommendations referred to in

paragraphs 2-3 below.    But before I take a decision on what

provision    the order should make, I invite your views.    This letter



therefore initiates the consultation required by Section 3(1) of

the Teachers&apos; Pay and Conditions Act 1987.



2. I propose to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendations that



i. the salaries of all qualified teachers should

be raised by a uniform 6% to the figures set

out in paragraph 4.13 of the Committee&apos;s

report with effect from 1 April 1989;



ii. the salaries of unqualified teachers should

be raised by the same percentage, (paragraph

4.13).    The allowance for teachers of the

visually impaired and hearing impaired would

also be increased by 6%;



iii. the spot salaries for Heads and Deputies

should be increased by 7.5% with effect from

1 April 1989,  (paragraph 4.21);



iv. the rates of the London area allowances

should be increased by 5.6% with effect from

1 July 1988,  (paragraph 5.16);



B2


CONFIDENTIAL - CfjlO until  17 February 1989



vi,



the value of each of the incentive

allowances should be increased by 7% with

effect from 1 April 1989,  (paragraph 4.34);



the planned number of incentive allowances

should be expanded from September 1989 by

9,500 (5,000 extra A allowances; 2,500  

allowances; 1,500 C allowances and 500 D

allowances):  (paragraphs 4.31 and 4.32).

There will need to be some consequential

revisions to the limits relating to incentive

allowances in Annex A to Appendix I of the

School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document

1988,  (paragraph 4.33).



3.    The Committee makes a number of other recommendations which

would require amendments to the School Teachers&apos; Pay and

Conditions Document 1988 (the 1988 Document):



a. that teachers returning to regular full-time

or part-time teaching should be paid on re-

entry at no lower point on the mainscale than

when last employed as a regular full-time or

part-time teacher (paragraph 5.21)



b. that, contingent upon the introduction of the

proposed licensed teacher arrangements, there

should be discretion for local authorities or

governors, as.appropriate, to pay licensed

teachers at either qualified or unqualified

rates (paragraph 5.26)



c. that local authorities (and, at the

delegated budgets) should be given discretion

to accelerate a teacher&apos;s progression to the

top of the mainscale (paragraph 5.29)



d. that once the necessary regulations under

Section 218 of the Education Reform Act have



B3


CONFIDENTIAL, - CMO until 17 February 1989



been made, a teacher who is awarded Qualified

Teacher Status (QTS) retrospectively should

be entitled to receive back pay from any

authority he/she has worked for from the date

from which his/her qualification runs, to

make good any difference between what he/she

was actually paid up to the point when QTS

was awarded and what he/she would have been

entitled to as a qualified teacher

(paragraph 5.41)



that the discretions over pay and conditions

currently exercised by local education

authorities set out in Appendix I of the

report should be transferred to governing

bodies of schools with budgets delegated

under Chapter III of Part I of the Education

Reform Act 1988 (paragraph 7.24) and that the

decision on whether it is &quot;reasonably

practicable to provide a supply teacher&quot;

should transfer to the governors in those

schools where the governing body have been

made responsible, under the relevant LMS

scheme, for managing the arrangements for

providing supply teachers (paragraph 7.26)



that the functions, both mandatory and

discretionary, currently allocated to LEAs

under the 1988 Document should be allocated

to governing bodies of grant maintained (GM)

schools (paragraph 7.28)



that where a GM school was formerly a

voluntary school, a head teacher should carry

out his/her professional duties in accordance

with any trust deed applying to the school

(paragraph 7.29)



that salary safeguarding on a discretionary

basis and discretionary safeguarding on



B4


CONFIDENTIAL - CMO until  17 February 1989



London allowance and social priority

allowance should apply in both directions

between a GM school and its former

maintaining authority (paragraph 7.31)



i.      that the provision in relation to cover at

sub paragraph 35(9)(b)(ii) of the 1988

Document should be amended in the direction

of wording suggested by the Professional

Association of Teachers (paragraph 8.9)



j.      that the reference to payment for midday

supervision at paragraph 23 of the 1988

Document should be deleted (paragraph 8.14)



k.      that the reference to education legislation

in the &quot;overriding requirements&quot; section of

head teachers conditions of employment -

paragraph 27(i) of the 1988 Document - should

be updated to include the Education Reform

Act 1988 (paragraph 8.24)



1.     that specific reference should be made in

both head teachers and schoolteachers

conditions of service to the Basic (including

National) Curriculum, and, in the case of

head teachers, to the collective worship

requirements of the Education Reform Act

(paragraph 8.25)



I propose to accept all these recommendations.



4.    The Order I propose to make to give effect to all of the

above would do so by bringing into effect a new School Teachers&apos;

Pay and Conditions Document.    The Committee&apos;s remaining

recommendations do not require changes to the 1988 Document: I do

not therefore propose to change the document in response to those

recommendations.    Nor is it intended to revise the RSG

settlements for 1989-90 on account of the proposals set out in

paragraphs 2 and 3 above.    The cost will be offset in part by the



B5


CONFIDENTIAL ? CMO until 17 February 1989



greater than expected reduction in the employers&apos; contributions

to the Teachers Superannuation Scheme which I announced on 10

February.



5. Any comments on the proposals set out above and on any other

matters raised in the report are invited by 10 March.    If you

would like to express your views in a meeting would you let my

office know of this as soon as possible so that any meetings can

take place before Easter.



6. Following these consultations a new School Teachers&apos; Pay and

Conditions Document will be prepared.    There will then be

opportunity to comment on the precise wording of the amendments

prior to the publication of the new Document and the laying

before Parliament of an Order which will give effect to its

provisions.



7. The Interim Advisory Committee say that they hope it will be

possible for a copy of the report to be seen by teachers in every

maintained school.    Enough copies of the report are being sent to

each local education authority for a copy to be circulated in

each school.
