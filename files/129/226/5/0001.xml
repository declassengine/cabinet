THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1989-90

Memorandum by the Lord President



BACKGROUND AND PROPOSED PROGRAMME



As the Cabinet

session&apos;s progrAjjsame

heavy programme 1

for the next sessi

fourth (1990-91) ses

time.    Next session&apos;s

pressures in mind. We

Bills which would not be

Parliament and which ther

programme.    Equally, there



ised a year ago (CC(88) 9th Meeting), the present

at the limits of what can be managed,  and this very

to have a knock-on effect on the starting date

is essential, however, that we plan for the

this Parliament to begin at the conventional

me must be constructed with both these

so recognise that there are some necessary

le for a fourth or fifth session of the

ave a strong claim on next session&apos;s

.er Bills that would be perfectly



suitable for the later sessi



could be deferred with that in mind.

een through the usual process of

oses the programme set out at

programme, which has a very

the Courts and Legal Services Bill, the^yjj^Jr Bill, the Environmental

Protection Bill, the Health Services BilW^and the Human Fertilisation and

Embryology (Control) Bill.    The programmeM:ontains several Bills which

would be controversial and will consume a good deal of time in both

Houses.    One particular difficulty is that amendm&amp;jjts to the abortion law

are likely to be within the scope of the Human /iirtmlisation and

Embryology (Control) Bill, and this is bound t&lt;vc nJ|W:&lt;cate the Bill&apos;s

passage.



3.      The programme which QL recommend is again at t

be delivered in the session, and there is no continge

unforeseeable extras.    Once again I must ask colleague

significant additions to the programme would need to be ?

BILLS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR INCLUSION



4.      A list of the Bills which QL decided not to include in the

recommended programme is at Annex B.    As usual,  the list contains a number

of attractive bids,  and I particularly draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention to the

guments which were put to QL in favour of the following:



Town and Country Planning Bill



Bill would provide for changes to land compensation

ngements, which would be of help in connection with major



tructure projects such as the channel tunnel rail link; changes

elopment plans, which were the subject of a White Paper

d last month; charging for appeals, which should help to

e the backlog of planning applications and appeals; and, subject

leagues&apos;  policy agreement, measures on planning enforcement,

which is a subject on which there is widespread public concern.

There is clegjrly a strong case for proceeding quickly with this Bill,

but planniiig^reto is a politically lively issue and, although the Bill

would protytilyjihe no more than 30-40 clauses, it would undoubtedly

take up a goqy?^^l of Parliamentary time.



(b)      Open Mar



The Secretary of

order to assist QL,

containing 50 clause

was room, a further 3

Secretary of State for

Exchequer emphasised

is an important element of

competition and promoting eripffr

out in a Green Paper publishe

were introduced next session it

background for the Lord Chancel

services,  and the corresponding

consumer credit, which is also of

welcome in view of current concerns



r Trade and Industry has indicated that, in

be prepared to trim this to a Bill

strictive trade practices and, if there

uses on consumer credit.    Both the

nd Industry and the Chancellor of the

lation on restrictive trade practices

vernment&apos;s policy of increasing

e.    The policy proposals were set

year.    Provided that the Bill

provide a very helpful

ill on the reform of legal

measure.    Legislation on

eregulatory nature, would be

out credit practices.



(c)      Road Traffic Bill



The Secretary of State for Transport has 1?

prepared to trim this Bill to a 70 clause me

North Review of Road Traffic Law, together

amendments to the Road Traffic Act.    The White

Government&apos;s response to the North Review, which

month, has been extremely well received.    The ref

law is widely seen to be overdue and legislation woul

all sides.    The Secretary of State for Transport is

the Government would be criticised for delay and woul

initiative if legislation were not brought in at the fir,

opportunity.    We might also be faced with a number of Pr

Members&apos; Bills next session,  seeking to legislate on eleme

own White Paper proposals.

In each of these cases, QL recognised that there were powerful arguments

for proceeding in the 1989-90 Session, but were simply unable to find room

in the programme.    QL considered that all three Bills would be suitable

for a fourth Session.



ARATION AND HANDLING OF BILLS



usual,  I must invite colleagues to take a particular interest in

the timely preparation of Bills for which they are responsible,

ate the great efforts that were made to have most of our major

at the beginning of the present session,  and it is essential

 t that performance this year as it provides the foundation

the whole session&apos;s business.    The management of the

^lso depends on a reasonable number of weighty Bills being

in the House of Lords.    The Lord Privy Seal and I will once

again be looking to colleagues to cooperate with us in making the

necessary choices
