I also informed the Cabinet of the enquiries I was instituting into the black market on the one hand and the system of supplementary allowances on the other and premised to report again by theend of March.2. Since then, the administrative difficulties have in no way diminished.    Though tho arrears of work which piledup last autumn have been overtaken,   there is still muchpublic criticism of tho anomalies inevitably associated withthe issue of individual supplementary allowances for l  millionvehicles.3. Moreover1,  tho effective enforcement of the rule thatpetrol may only be used for specific purposes has provedquite impossible.    It is easy to find excuses by v/hich the rule can be evaded, and in the limited number of cases whereproceedings have been taken,  the penalties have been much toolight to produce any deterrent effect. . Thus the lav/ and its administration are being brought into disrepute.    The citizenwho has laid up his car feels indignant not only on accountof tho inconvenience, but because he believes other people are getting away with it, while decent minded motorists withcars on the road who wish, to observe the lav/ arc continuallyirritated because of the restrictions nominally imposed upon them, and continually ignored by many of their fellows.4* I must emphasise that this situation is due in no way to any failure on the part of the police, who have done their best in most difficult circumstances, but is largelyinherent in the attempt to ensure in peacetime and without avast increase in enforcement staffs that no petrol whatever may be used except for certain permitted purposes,.    It is a situation which, seems to me most -unsatisfactory in every way and from which we must try and find a way out as soon aspossible.    The Russell Vick Committee whose report is referredto below emphasise that one of the most important steps to be
taken if the black Market is to bo suppressed is tc regain thesupport and confidence of the motoring public. I do not think this will be possible without seme modification of the presentrationing arrangements.5* There appears, however,  to bo no doubt that thewithdrawal of the Basic ration to -coder with the ether petrolcuts imposed in the autumn have achieved substantial savings.I estimate these savings for the five months ended 29th Fooruoat nearly 350,000 tons,  costing 15,000,000 dollars.    althoughMarshall Aid now seems almost certain,   it hoc been -one ^tedlywithout further cuts and&quot;not to increase rations.   Further?&apos;whilo the tanker position will be eooier in the sec end halfof this year,  our future oil supplies ere nest uncertain,i have assumed therefore that however grievous the politicaland administrative consequences of withdrawing the basic rationmay have been,  we cannot possibly c mt emulate a return tc thelevel of petrel consumption reached loot summer and that v/emust try rather to find, o solution without any increase in con-sumption at all.6. The first step must be t-  tackle the black market.In another paper I deal in detail with the recomnaendations ofthe Russell Vick Committee set-up to stub,- this matter.    TheCommittee estimate that in 19h7 about 130,000 tons of petrolwere transferred from commercial tc private use through the black market.    This figure must have been substantially reducedsince the restrictions imposed last autumn.    It is neverthelessprobable that 50-100,000 tens of petrol ore still being consumedin this way,  and their main proposals,  if adopted,  should puta stop to this and should prevent an even mere serious leakfrom developing if a basic ration wore to be reemo-cd.7. One of the measures proposed by the Committee is a cut of 10$ in the allowances to goods vehicles.    The   yrosssaving from this would be 22+0,000 tons a year, -put us therewould doubtless be many appeals and fewer coupons unused,  thenet saving in petrol consumption would be much less and presumably would net greatly,  if at all,  eocceed the 30-100,000tons which could be stopped from entering the black market.8. It has not proved possible to devise any practical measures which could be automatically applied so as to secure an immediate saving in the E and S allowances to motorists.But I am satisfied that, by careful scrutiny over a period,we can achieve some reduction in consumption here, which xestimate at 20,000 tens at least per annum.9. It appears,  therefore,  that free trie sources mentionedin the preceding paragraphs there may be provided 70-120,000tons of petrol per annum which without any increase in total consumption could be used in any modification of. the  rationing system we make.10. With these considerations in mind I new propose thefollowing plan, which if approved should operate from 1st June.(a)    A &quot;standard11 allowance shall be mage available forevery person owning a motor vehicle.    This will allow approximately90 miles a month motoring,  as compared with the basic rationwhich allowed 270 miles a month immediately before it was withdrawn.    This &quot;standard&quot; allowance may be used for any purpose.
(To)    Tho &quot;standard&quot; allowance will be deducted in fullfrom all existing allowances so that those receiving supolo-mentary allowances equal to or oxcocdin : the &quot;standard&quot; rationget the same total number of coupons as&quot;before.    This is in contrast to the old basic ration which was additional to the supplementary allowances.    The principle will be that everymotorist is entitled to a &quot;standard&quot; allowance without enquiry as to his &quot;needs&quot;&quot;, but that if ho wants to obtain more he *must show that the-standard allowance is insufficient for thosebusiness and other purposes which are taken into account bytho Regional Petroleum Officers.    I think this can be defendedon tho ground that at present we just cannot afford any morepetrol, that those now receiving supplementary allowancesalready get a good deal of &quot;convenience&quot; motoring, and thatthey will have the advantage of being able to use their&quot;standard&quot; allowance freely.(c) If these proposals arc adopted, it may be necessaryto find in a full year, after the changeover from the presentsystem is complete, approximately ShO,COO standard allowances for the motor cars at present off the road,  at an averageof 3-2/3 gallons per vehicle,  and approximately 330,CCOallowances for motor -cycles at present off the road, at anaverage of 2i gallons per vehicle;  that is to soy about120,000 tons&apos;of petrol per annum.(d) The coupons which make up the standard allowance will bo available for six months,  thereby enabling tho motoristto save up and use them all together if he thinks fit.11. It will be seen that in this plan there is still thepossibility of a very slight increase in petrol consumption.But the maximum increase which is at all likely (apart fromseasonal variations) is no more than 50,000 tons per annumcompared with a total consumption of nearly 3 million tons.I feel this is a very small risk to take for the administrative,political and social advantages which should, result from thepropo se d change.12. There are two further modifications which I alsowish to make.(a) Both in the measures taken against the black market and the scaling down of allowances, it is imperative thatwo should have the fullest possible support from the&apos;motoringpublic.    In order to help us to obtain this and. at the sametime get the benefit of the advice and experience of the organisations most .closely connected with petrol rationing,I propose to set up a small advisory committee including representatives of the Automobile Association and the RoyalAutomobile Club.    Its function will be to keep the rationing system under constant review and in the light of the total amount of petrol which the Government decides to make availablefor private cars,  to advise on any changes which may benecessary.    I must make it clear however that I do not think we shall obtain the support of the motoring organisationsunless we can allow sane small all-purpose ration such as Ihave proposed, in paragraph 10.(b) In view of the uncertainty which necessarily attaches to our future dollar and petrol supplies, it is desirable thatwe should be in a position,  if the need arises,  to reduce at short notice tho less important supplementary allowances.
This can be achieved if in future we issue tho allowances in different types of coupons,  some of which con have theirface value altered by announcement.    I need not trouble the cabinet with one or two technical questions connected withthis matter on which I propose to enlist the advice of thecommittee referred to in (a) above.13. filth;.ugh I cannot protend, in view of the limitedsupplies of petrol available for private cops (about 30% of pre-war)?  that the arrangements sot out in paragraphs 10 and12 are completely satisfactory, ...1 -bslievo--they offer the best solution of a very difficult problem, and I cm fairly confidentthey will command tho support of the majority of motoristsand of the metering organisations.    Accordingly I ash theCabinet to approve them.    As I have in any case promised to make a statement shortly so that people may make holidayplans,  I should also like to have authority to announce thenew arrange:.:onto immediately after tho Easter recess, atthe same time as the vick Committee report and the Government&apos;decision on it are made public.K.T.KMinistry of 00.00. anu Power, S.W.I.,18th liar oh, Iph-O
