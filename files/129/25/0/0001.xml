(48) 6123rd February, 1948CABINETOVERSEAS MILITARY EXPENDITUREJoint Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof defence at the meeting of the Cabinet on 2nd December, 1947 (CM. (47) 92ndConclusions, Minute 2) we were invited to consider, in consultation, whetherspecial machinery should be set up to ensure that overseas expenditure by theService Departments was kept in line with the Government&apos;s general balance ofpayments policy.2. We are satisfied that the present arrangements, which have recently been strengthened, are sufficient to secure that the overseas expenditure of the militaryforces is adequately controlled. Control is exercised in the three following ways : (i) Normal  Treasury control  as exercised  over  military  expenditure,whether at home or overseas,(ii) The    control    exercised    through    the    Exchange    requirements committee which has been strengthened to fit the present stringency.&apos;(iii) Special reviews of particular branches of expenditure, such as onerecently concluded on that incurred on overseas works.3. The scope of overseas military expenditure can be illustrated by an analysis of current expenditure which is estimated to run for the first half of1948 at the rate of about  79 million a year. It is difficult to analyse this withany accuracy but a rough indication of its composition is as follows :  Net cash issues to uniformed personnelWorks ServicesPay of civilians   ...Stores and Supplies       ......Miscellaneous (including Transport)26,000.00015,000,00021,000,00011,000,0006,000,00079.000.000(a) Cash issues to uniformed personnel4 A considerable part of the local drawings of pay by officers and other ranks is recovered through such means as canteen receipts. The figure of 26 million in the table makes allowance for this and represents net drawingsonly.  The amount can only be diminished by reducing numbers overseas.(b) Works ServicesNew work is being restricted to the minimum, almost invariably in semi-permanent construction, to accommodate troops who are being redeployed. Thesmall amount of maintenance work in hand is confined, in spite of pressing needsfollowing excessive deterioration during the war, to what is absolutely essential.A special review of overseas works has recently been made by the Ministry ofDefence and the Treasury, and we are agreed that the current programmes, whichhave been substantially reduced, are reasonable.34965
(c) Pay of CiviliansLarge numbers of civilians are employed in stores and supply depots andin workshops. The existence of very large storage depots, and the heavy move-ments of stores now taking place, particularly in the Middle East, account forthe heavy expenditure under this head. The Minister of Defence has undertakena review with the object of reducing civilian staffs to the minimum.(d) Stores and SuppliesThis includes local food purchases of certain items of the ration, e.g., freshvegetables within normal approved scales. These are at present under investiga-tion, but. by and large, local expenditure is related to the size of the forces andis capable of substantial decrease only by a reduction in numbers.(e) MiscellaneousThis last heading covers a miscellaneous collection of small items which are inevitable when forces are maintained overseas. Treasury control is brought tobear principally through the general stringency enforced by limitation of estimates.5. The foregoing figures exclude oil and food other than local purchases.The oil requirements are reviewed by the Exchange Requirements Committee.Economies were introduced in the second half of 1947 following discussion between the Minister of Defence and the Service Ministers. Food, other thanlocal purchases, is provided by the Ministry of Food and reviewed as part of theimport programme.6. Very little of the expenditure is incurred either directly or indirectlyin dollars. About 70 per cent, of the total expenditure is accounted for byexpenditure in Palestine, Egypt, Malaya, Gibraltar and Malta, the first twocountries accounting for some 40 per cent, of the whole.r. s: c.A.
