HIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT     JPrinted for the Cabinet. - March 194866SECRETCopy No.0 c.p.. (48) 733rd March, 1948CABINETMONOPOLISTIC PRACTICES bill memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIN July 1946, my predecessor circulated to the Lord Presidents Committeea memorandum on Restrictive Practices (L.P. (48) 202) outlining the sort oflegislation which might be devised to deal with these practices. The relevantpassages from this memorandum are given in the Annex. The Committee inSeptember 1946 authorised the preparation of a Bill for submission to the Cabineton the lines foreshadowed (L.P. (46) 31st Meeting).2. I now submit a Bill which follows closely the proposals outlined in 1946.There are a few points, however, where it has been necessary to depart from theseproposals and where the emphasis has altered.   These I list below : (a) SanctionsAs was foreshadowed, the Bill would give power to compel with relation to particular goods withdrawal from agreements altogether or in part and to preventthe making or carrying out of agreements wholly or in part. The Bill would also give power to deal with practices such as boycotts. Price control is already autho-rised by existing legislation and finds no place in the Bill for that reason. Thepowers under the Bill cannot, however, be exercised unless the proposed Commis-sion has not only reported that conditions of imperfect competition exist but alsothat they are contrary to the public interest. To some extent this limits, ofcourse, our powers to act, but it will undoubtedly ease the passage of the measurethrough Parliament and will give an added sense of responsibility to the Com-mission. It would be difficult in practice to justify the establishment of aCommission to consider in an impartial way whether particular activities arecontrary to the public interest and at the same time to take powers to act against such activities even when the Commission reports that they are in the publicinterest. In the international sphere, which I deal with below, the limitation isprobably desirable in any case. A corollary of this proposal is that the Commis-sion, and particularly its Chairman, must be men of intelligence and drive; indeedI think that only on these conditions will good men be willing to serve.(&amp;) International agreements the Bill provides that the Commission could be asked either (i) to investigate the facts of a case that is to say whether there are conditions of imperfectcompetition or (ii) to investigate the facts and, if there are conditions ofimperfect competition, to say whether these conditions are in the public interestand, if not, to suggest remedies. In making it possible for the Board of Tradeto refer only the facts I had particularly in mind the obligations which we mayassume under Chapter V of the Charter of the International Trade Organisation :these are very briefly to supply information to the Organisation and, within limits,to take action after the receipt of an unfavourable report. It will, under theBill, remain the fact, in the case of private undertakings, that action to compelwithdrawal from an international agreement can only be taken if our ownCommission has reported that the agreement is not in the public interest, and this35010b
limitation is ^ our interest. In this respect our legislation would go as faras, but no further than, that operating in the United States and Canada. Inthe case of public undertakings the powers of the Government derive more directly from the Acts which set them up.(c) Public InterestI have not included in the Bill any definition of the public interest. Theidea of including a list of criteria dates from the time of the Coalition Govern-ment, when each side was anxious to make clear its differing views of the publicinterest. It proved difficult to devise any set of criteria which would not seemsomewhat platitudinous in the short-run and might not in the long-run lookfoolish through change of circumstances. I have, therefore, at present retainedpower to give general and particular directions to the Commission, although this may throw doubts upon the impartiality of the Commission. I hope, however,that in practice a conception of the public interest in relation to monopolisticpractices will grow naturally from the investigations carried out and from the interchange of views between the Board of Trade and the Commission. I should welcome my colleagues&apos; views on the question whether I should take power togive directions to the Commission in this way or should be content to rely uponmore informal methods.(d) Consultation with Other DepartmentsI have not provided in the Bill for consultation with other Departmentssince it is no longer the practice to do so; but I do not intend, of course, to makereferences to the Commission except in agreement with the Minister responsible.In the unlikely event of continuing disagreement in a particular case we should no doubt submit the issue to our colleagues. Much of the detailed work before a reference is made to the Commission and after a report has been receivedwill fall to the Departments responsible for the industries concerned, who will,I hope, in this as in other matters where the Board of Trade take a responsibilityfor general policy, provide the contact with industry.(e) Public CorporationsI propose to leave the activities of these Corporations out of the Bill inso far as their monopoly activities are concerned, although they will be covered in respect of activities which give rise to imperfect competition and are not expressly authorised by the Act setting them up. This means that the coal board are excluded so far as coal is concerned, but would be covered if they made machinery and entered into a restrictive agreement with other machinery-makers. The Commission will have the duty of advising the Board of Tradewhen asked outside the provisions of formal reference and this duty extends tothe activities of public Corporations a potentially useful provision as the Corn-mission grows into an expert body. This informal consultation will be equallyopen for use in the case of private industry.3. The Bill does not, of course, deal with the restrictive practices of tradeunions and I may well have to deal with substantial criticisms on this point inthe Second Reading debate. I hope that the Minister of Labour will fore-armme on this aspect and will be ready if necessary to intervene.4. I cannot yet say how many people will be needed to staff the Commissionbut I do not intend that it shall be more than fifty people.5. Although a Bill on these lines has been in mind for several years it became possible only recently to start serious drafting. It is a Bill which presentssome difficulty on this score particularly in the Clauses defining conditions ofimperfect competition which must be made workable and reasonably inclusive.Although the main points of principle are settled, I may, therefore, wish tomake further alterations in the text of the Bill before submission to the legislation committee. Subject to these reservations, I ask my colleagues for authorityto proceed.J. H. W.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,3rd March, 1948.
ANNEXExtracts from L.P. (46) 202 describing the Proposed Legislation on restrictive practices******4. A Statutory Commission should be established with adequate powers to investigate records, costs, &amp;c, and to compel evidence on oath. The commission should not be given a roving field of enquiry, but should enquire into a caseonly at the request of the President of the Board of Trade, who would be respon-sible for its appointment. The Board of Trade might institute an investigationeither of its own accord or following a complaint from the public, but there shouldbe no obligation on it to refer a practice to the Commission unless it thought itdesirable to do so.   The Commission would have it own staff.5. The reports of the Commission would be published in the absence of strong reasons (e.g., security) to the contrary. In addition to reviewing the factsdisclosed, the Commission would make recommendations for remedying anyundesirable effects of the practice. It would be given some general criteria,such as the effect on prices, efficiency, employment and exports, by which to formits judgment; but its hands should not be tied and it should be able to take account of other matters either upon its own initiative or on the instructions of the Board of Trade. The Commission should not be empowered to investigatestatutory monopolies. The Coalition Government, who gave considerable thought to this matter, envisaged a Commission of Enquiry with no further powers, andthe then Solicitor-General, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, drafted the Heads of a Billsetting up such a Commission (R. (44) 187 and R. (45) 16).6. In my view, mere enquiry is inadequate. The Bill should give powerto the Board of Trade to make proposals to Parliament which would be basedon the Commission^ report, though they would not necessarily be the same inall details. These proposals would be in the form of Orders, subject to affirmations-tive resolution. The Debates on them would gradually create a body of principlesby which restrictive practices would come to be judged. The details will haveto be worked out more fully, but there should probably be power to make Orders (1) declaring a particular agreement to be illegal so that operation under it would be an illegal conspiracy;(2) prohibiting discrimination in the acceptance of orders from variouscustomers (in order to strike at boycotts, stop lists, resale price main-tenance and similar contrivances);(3) regulating prices and margins (which involves the permanent retentionin this field of our present powers of price control).******8. The policy must cover the whole industrial field we cannot have onepolicy for Board of Trade industries and another for industries such as food and engineering just because they happen to be the responsibility of another department. I think, however, that responsibility for the policy should rest with one department and that that department should be the Board of Trade.Inevitably the application of policy will fall very often to other departments,but I suggest that, both because we shall be building up, by experience on individual cases, a more concrete policy (see paragraph 6) and because of theneed to regulate the load upon the Commission, the application of the policy should be co-ordinated by the Board of Trade; that, while the responsible Produc-tion Department would take the initiative in referring cases to the Commissionand would be responsible for any disciplinary measures which had to be imposed on the industry, the reference of cases to the Commission and the action taken on the Commission^ report would be the joint responsibility of the ProductionMinister and the President of the Board of Trade.******35010

(1) A reference of a matter to the Commission for in- scope of15 investigation and report may be so framed as either  references.(a) to limit the investigation and report to the facts, that isto say to the question whether conditions of imperfectcompetition to which this Act applies in fact prevail,and if so in what manner and to what extent, and to20 the things which are done by the parties concerned asa result of, or for the purpose of preserving, those conditions ; or(b) to require the Commission to investigate and report onthe facts as aforesaid and also to investigate and report25 whether the conditions in question and the things done as aforesaid operate or may be expected to operate against the public interest, either generally or in any respect.(2) Where the reference of a matter to the Commission for30 investigation and report is not so framed as to limit the investi-gation and report to the facts, it may, if the Board of Tradethinks fit, be so framed as to require the Commission, if they find that conditions of imperfect competition to which this Act1   applies prevail, thereafter to confine their investigation to the! 35 question whether any such things as are specified in the referenceare done by the parties concerned as a result of, or for thepurposes of, preserving those conditions, and, if so, whether ornot those things operate or may be expected to operate againstthe public interest, either generally or in any respect.40 (3) The Board of Trade may at any time vary any reference made by them of a matter to the Commission for investigation and report.
A.D. 1948.      (4) The power conferred by subsection (3) of this section-       extends to requiring the Commission, where they have already made an investigation and report which is limited to the facts,to proceed with their investigation as if the reference in question.!had not been so limited, and to make a further report accordingly, jDuties of 7.
