CHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET  copy NO. P QCP. (U8) 799th March, 19h8.CABINETPARLIAMENT BILL -Memorandum hy the Prime minister the discussions between Party Leaders have indicated that there is a fair prospect of finding a basis for agreementbetween the political Parties on the future composition of theHouse of Lords.      Less progress has been made,  however, towardsagreement on the amendment of the Parliament Bill.     TheConservative Leaders are demanding that the &quot;period of delay&quot;which must elapse under the Parliament Act procedure before aBill leaves the Commons for the last.time should be not less than twelve months from the first occasion on which it received itsThird Reading in the Commons.      That demand must clearly be resisted.     The Government representatives in the Conference are,however, disposed to put forward, as a compromise, the proposal that the period of delay should be expressed as &quot;either twelvemonths from Second Reeding or nine months from Third Reading,whichever is the longer&quot;.      They invite the views of the Cabineton this proposal.2. This formula would not enlarge the period of delay forany Bill, which passed quickly through the Commons.      Its object is to satisfy the Lords that they would have reasonable time toconsider a Bill on which the proceedings in the Commons had beenunusually protracted.     Broadly speaking, the second test of nine months from Third Reading would not come into operation unless aBill had taken more thansthree months in the Commons.In the following table the effect of the formula istested by reference to some of the major measures introduced inthe present Parliament, the Government of India Bill, 1935 and thetwo Bills enacted in 1913 under the Parliament -Bill.     For thepurposes of this table it is assumed that all these Bills were rejected by the Lords and had to be enacted under the parliament act procedure.      Column II giv,es the dote on which each would have become low (one month after,leaving the Commons for the last time)under the provisions of the Parliament Bill as it now stands,with the period of delay expressed as &quot;twelve months from SecondReading&quot;.     Column III gives the date on which each would have become low under the alternative formula now proposed, with theperiod of delay expressed as &quot;twelve months from Second Readingor nine months from Third Reading&quot;.     Column IV gives the totalperiod which would have elapsed, under the alternative formula.nowproposed, between the first occasion on which the Bill receivedits Second Reading in the Commons and the date of presentationfor Royal Assent.

Commons (Civil Aviation, Trade Disputes and Bank of England), the&apos; alternative formula does not lengthen the total period of delay: proposed in the Parliament Bill as introduced.      For major bills which occupy more than three months in the Commons, the period of delay would be extended by such time beyond three months as isI taken in the Commons.      The long period of delay shown above inrespect of the two Acts of 1913 is explained by the fact that thesetook, respectively, eight and nine months to pass through the commons.      Under modern&apos; conditions it seems unlikely that futureBills would be delayed in the Commons for such long periods as these.3. The formula has also been tested by reference to theprobable course of the proceedings on the Iron and Steel Bill inthe 1948/49 Session.It has been assumed, for this purpose that the Bill will receive its Second Reading in the -Commons on 27th October, 1948,that thirty clays will be required in Standing Committee (ascompared with thirty-one days on the much longer Transport Bill),and that the Bill will be sent tj the Lords on 12th April, 1949*If the Parliament Bill had been rejected by the Lords and had to[be enacted under the Parliament Act,  1911, that Bill could not be presented for Royal Assent before December,  1949.      The Iron and[Steel Bill could not be presented for Royal Assent under the amendedparliament Act procedure until March,  1950.If, on the other hand,  the Parliament Bill were passed this Session with the period of delay expressed as &quot;twelve monthsIfrom Second Reading or nine months from Third. Reading&quot;, the Ironland Steel Bill could be oresented for Royal Assent on 12th February,1 950.
h. These details suggest that,  from the practical pointof view of handling the Government&apos;s legislative programme during the remainder of the present Parliament,  there, would beno serious disadvantage in the alternative formula of &quot;twelvemonths from Second Reading or nine months from Third Reading&quot;.Indeed,  if the Opposition accepted that formula and passed the parliament Bill in that form before the end of the present session, the practical task of managing Government business during the remainder of the  present Parliament would he easierthan it would be if the Parliament Bill remained in its present form and was rejected by the Lords and hod to be enacted underthe provisions of the Parliament Act,  1911.      Thus,  from thepoint of view of our immediate practical needs, we should gain byreaching an agreement with the Opposition on the basis of this alternative formula.5. In the longer run we should secure two advantages.First, if agreement were reached between the Parties on the basisof this alternative formula,  the Parliament Bill would be passed this Session as an agreed measure.     There would then be lesslikelihood of- its being upset at a later date,  if a conservative government should be returned to power with a large majority.Secondly,  if agreement can be reached on the amendment of the parliament Bill, there is a fair prospect of finding a basis fora lasting agreement between the political Parties on the future constitution of the House of Lords.      If,   on the other hand,  theParty Leaders fail to come to terms on the Bill,  their discussions on the other subject will be broken off and theprospect of an agreed reform of the House of Lords will be castaway.Against these considerations we must set the difficultyof satisfying Government supporters that it is expedient tooffer a concession involving some extension of the period of delay originally proposed when the Parliament Bill was introduced.It is on this point that I particularly invite the views of mycolleagues.6. In conclusion,  however,  I should emphasise that theGovernment would not be finally committed to acceptance of thealternative formula of &quot;twelve months from Second Reading or nine months from Third Reading&quot; if it were put forward at this stage bytheir representatives in the Party Leaders&apos; Conference.      Thepurpose of the present discussions is to find, without finalcommitment, a provisional basis of agreement on which each sidecould consult its supporters.      All that the Government would be committed to do would be to ascertain whether such a formulawould be acceptable to their supporters.      And it would be opento them,  as it would to the Opposition Leaders,  to report bock,if this proved to be the case, that .after consultations they saw no prospect of being able to carry their Party with them insupport of the proposed formula.      The Government representatives in the Conference feel, however,  that, before they put thisproposal forward,  they should know that they would have theunited support of their Cabinet colleagues in commending itsubsequently to the Parliamentary Labour Party and to the LabourParty Executive.C.R.A.10, Downing Street,  S.W.1.9th March,  19^8.-3-
