SECRET COPY NO. 5&quot;0CP. (U8)  &amp;k12th March,  191+8.CABINETHAVANA TRADE conference memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Havana Trade Conference is now in its concludingstages and the Final Act of the Conference is due to &quot;be signed on or about&apos; the 16th March.      At Havana (as distinct from geneva, where the Preparatory Committee for the HavanaConference was attended by some 20 countries)  there have been62 participants.      The newcomers have neither the interestin world trade nor the advantage of long preparation which thecountries members of tho Preparatory Committee possess.      Theyhave thus been an extremely troublesome element.      By virtue oftheir numerical strength they hove been able to introduce certain,changes (not always to our advantage) but all the other countries&quot;who were associated with us&quot;at Geneva hove clearly come to theconclusion that concessions must be made.     We are thus facedwith a more or less solid body of opinion which has agreed can draft Charter and is pressing with the utmost urgency that anend may be made to a Conference which has now been in sessionfor nearly 1+ months (about double the time originally planned).Historical Summary and Commitments2. The Havana Conference is the final stage of a longseries of international negotiations which began with thediscussions on commercial policy with the United States atthe same time as the negotiations for the Financial agreement in 191+5.      These discussions resulted in the &quot;Proposals&quot;(Gmd. 6709).      At the time of their publication we associatedourselves with the Americans in sponsoring the &quot;Proposals&quot; andwe undertook to endeavour to carry through the necessaryinternational discussions to a successful conclusion (Appendix 1,-paragraph 1).      The Prime Minister also made a statement to this effect in the House of Commons on 6th December,  191+5 (Appendix 1,paragraph 2).3. The next stage in the international discussions was theassembling of a Preparatory Committee composed of 17 countries,including nearly all the major trading nations. *   Russia was invited but has consistently hold aloof from all the international discussions,  a point which - as the Canadians have been at pains to point out to us - odds some emphasis to the political needfor a successful conclusion of the Havana Conference.s   Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France,Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, S. Africa, U.S.A.The attitude of Brazil, Cuba and India was somewhatdoubtful.ili&apos;13 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
kf The result of the London meeting was (i) theproduction of the first draft of the Charter of an international trade Organisation with a considerable measure of unanimityamongst the countries concerned (though the discussions were onthe expert level and to that extent non-committal);    and (ii)agreement on a. plan to moot .again for a more committaldiscussion of the draft Charter ana for tariff negotiationsamongst the countries which were   members of the preparatory committee.      The results of the London discus si ens were reportedto the Committee on Overseas Economic Policy in 0. E. P. (l+o) 10.5. .    The discussions at Geneva in the summer of 1 9h7 had two results.      First,  the draft Charter was further revised andelaborated.      Every point in  the draft was consistent with thedecisions of Ministers.      It was subsequently laid beforeParliament as Cmd. 7212.      Secondly,  agreement was reached onthe terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  whichincorporated -(i)    those parts of the draft Charter necessary to preserve the value of the tariff concessions referred to under (ii);    and(ii) the results of simultaneous tariff negotiationscarried on between all the 22 countries whichnegotiated at Geneva.The terms of this Agreement, which was considered by ministers on several occasions in the late summer and autumn of 190,7,were laid before Parliament in Cmd. 7258.     On 29th January,1948,  the House of Commons approved the action of the Governmentin relation to this Agreement.     We ore at present only applying the Agreement provisionally (i.o. we con withdraw at 60 days&apos;notice).      The time for definite acceptance (when it will comeinto force for a period of 3 years and continue thereafter unlessdenounced with 6 months&apos; notice) will come when other countries are also ready to proceed to this stage (some of them need topass legislation before they can do so).Present Position at Havana6. As has been stated above,  the Havana Conference is a world Conference,  that is to say,  all countries members of theUnited Nations (execpt Russia and some satellites) togetherwith nearly all the non-members of the United Nations arepresent.      The method of operation of the Conference has been totake the Geneva draft ana to go through it.      As a result ofthe lesser interest in world trade of a number of the nowcountries and because of their reluctance to accept limitations on their freedom of action in relation to the protection anddevelopment of new industries, certain amendments hove been introduced, -which are not in the interests of ourselves, theUnited States and many other older established world traders.But the United States and the others have apparently come to theview that in the present state of the world a comprehensiveInternational Trade Organisation is more important than the securing of a Charter with only limited adherence but whichsafeguards our and their position more effectively.      The presentposition is thus that practically all the other participants inthe Conference are ready for signature of the Final Act and wehave to decide whether our Delegation shall sign it with or without reservation.      Signature of the Final Act of theConference will formally do no more than authenticate the text of the Charter,  and will not involve any commitment to accept(i.e.  ratify) the Charter, or even to recommend acceptance to
national legislatures.    Many countries will undoubtedly feelno hesitation in signing the Final Act without prejudice tothe question of acceptance.      The&quot;united Kingdom Delegationhave,  however,  taken the line that,  although signature of theFinal Act involves no commitment,  it should imply a reasonabledegree of probability that, the country concerned, will acceptthe Charter in due course.      Signature by the United kingdom delegate will undoubtedly be taken to mean that we intend torecommend the Charter to Parliament.      The occasion for so doing.will not .of course arise until the Americans at least have accepted (or seem about to accept).      It is unlikely that theywill in fact be able to present &quot;the necessary legislation to congress until next year.7* It is not possible to circulate with this memoranduma complete final version of the text which we ere asked thus to authenticate.      It is broadly the same as the text submitted,to Parliament in Cmd.  7212, but in  addition to a number of drafting amendments of minor importance,  amendments have been made on thepoints set out in Appendix 2.      I deal with some more radicalamendments on points of major importance in paragraphs 9 to 12below.      The relevant texts are attached as appendices,  references to which will be found in the appropriate paragraphs.8. On the following points changes have b-^en made toour advantage:(3)    Article U2 (Appendix 3)Customs Unions and steps towards Customs Unions.(b) Article 99 (Appendix- k)Colonial Accession.On the following articles we hove held our own, sometimes inmost difficult circumstances but hove given nothing away:(c) Article 20,__(2)(c)   (Appendix 5)Quota regulation for agricultural products.(d) Article 93 (Appendix 6)Relations with non-members.On the following point we hove had to accept the view of themajority on a matter on which we have been almost alone from the start though we have secured a useful bargain in return:(e) Articles 72 and 73 (Appendix 7)Voting and the Executive Board.The three points of outstanding importance dealt with in thefollowing.paragraphs are:-(i)    Quota protection for infant industries, where we have probably lost something in terms of trade but no great political point arises.(ii)    New preferences, where a  point of great political significance crises but where we are faced with the choice of accepting the  present position, which isthe best we con get, or of breaking up the Conference.
(iii)   Exceptions to the rule of non-discrimination,  the issue asto which is somewhat more technical though it is of theUtmost importance that We should secure a satisfactorytext. 1(i) Protective Quotas9* The text of the relevant Article is given in Appendix 8.The question at issue here is. the degree to which the so-calledunder-developed countries should &quot;be free to protect their infantindustries by restricting imports by quotas and how far suchaction should be controlled by the International Trade Organisation.At earlier meetings (in London and Gunova) the Americans havebeen violently opposed to any freedom for the under-developed countries in this respect, but we and others were, able to induce them to accept a compromise which we thought satisfied both the legitimate demands of the under-developed&quot;countries and our ownneed to safeguard our export trade.      At Havana, however,  the americans,  impressed no doubt by their own need to win  ever theLatin Americans, have token the lead in pressing on us 0 vorsi nof the Article concerned which goes significantly further inweakening the control of the International Trade Organisation andcorrespondingly lessens the safeguards to our exports.      while this new version may for. this reason be open to a good deal of criticism from our own exporting interests, we should be alone in resisting it (not a single Commonwealth country would be with us)and we really have no choice but to fall into line.      The merits&apos;and demerits of the proposed Article will, in fact,  only become clear in the course of its administration by the Organisation and wecould make clear,, in accepting it, that we shall rely on the under-developed countries to use their freedom with reason.(ii) Hew Preferences10. The text of the relevant Article is in Appendix 9.      the basic provision of the Charter, with regard to preferences, hasalways boon that no new; preferences shall be created and no existing ones increased.      We committed ourselves to this at theend of the 19h7 negotiations (300 paragraph 2 above).      The Genevadraft allowed for no departure from the rule unless,  quiteexceptionally,  the Organisation approved it, by a two-thirds majority vote,  as necessary for economic development.      Thestringency of these provisions has been heavily attacked atHavana by many of the under-developed countries,  particularly those in regional groups.      All the other Delegations have now agreed on a provision which places practically no obstacle in theway of creating new preferential systems,  provided &quot;that they arebetween countries in the same &quot;economic region&quot; and are calculated to assist in their economic development.      This provision may,in fact, be of some practical assistance to regional groups inour own Colonial Empire;    but it would plainly make it much harderto defend the general freezing of the Ottawa system.of imperial preference and our commitment under the &quot;Proposals&quot; of 19h7(Cmd.  6709)  to negotiate for its reduction.      Our Delegation have accordingly made it clear that any such differentiation betweenregional preferences and Imperial preferences would cause theutmost political difficulty.      With some assistance from the americans and some of the Commonwealth Delegations, we seem tohave secured agreement on an explanatory note (see Appendix 9)which will explain that it is open to the Organisation  to interpret the term &quot;economic region&quot;  as applicable to parts of theCommonwealth even though they ore separated by the oceans.-h-
11* Our Delegation have been in constant touch with theother Commonwealth Delegations on this question and,  having takenstock of it in the light of ;the final position set out above,are clear that we can secure no further amelioration of the-position.      All tho Commonwealth countries are of opinion thatthey would be well-advised to accept and hove indicated they couldnot support us if we tried to take the matter further.      Theposition is admittedly unsatisfactory but our answer in Parliamentmust be that while tho interpretative note does not give useverything we want we should have boon alone in pressing for moreand that it does at least open tho door to same amelioration ofthe previously absolute rule about no new preferences.      I should add that we should not bo stopped under this Article frommovements towards western union, which are dealt with in anotherArticle.(iii)   Non-di scrimination -12. The question of the extent to which members of thoOrganisation may depart from the principle of non-discrimination inadministering their import restrictions-has always boon onintractable one - not least because of the technical difficultyof translating those economic considerations into treaty language.At Geneva we were able to secure a draft which allowed us thenecessary freedom.      At Havana the matter has been rendered moredifficult for two reasons:    (a)  some members of the American delegation hove cast doubts on the proper interpretation of the geneva text;    and (b) the French, by taking fright at this,  leithe Americans to put forward an alternative text based on the transitional provisions of tho International Monetary FuniAgreement.      This does not suit tho united Kingdom,   partly because its freedom under that Agreement has been limited by theLoan Agreement.    . The American Ambassador in London, however,  hasbeen most helpful on this issue and has represented our difficulties to Washington.    As a result, wo have secured the addition of words which removes the doubt about the interpretation of thoGeneva text.      I hope that our remaining difficulty (which relates to the place of the International Monetary Fund in this matter)will be removed by a provision which will nilow us in effect toopt for tho Geneva rules,  while leaving others (notably tho French)subject to rules based on the International Monetary Fund.      Atthe time of circulation a satisfactory text has not be-en agreed,but I will report further orally.      I attach at Appendix 10 forthe purposes of illustration tho text of the relevant Article asit would appear in a form satisfactory to us.Attitude of Other Countries13. The Americans have clearly decided to go some way in giving in to the under-developed countries in order to secure a wide membership for the Organisation.      It would bo a great shock to thorn if we,  who have been committed to association with them inthe enterprise from tho start, were to fall out at the very endof the long process of negotiation and conference.      Most of thecountries whose political ideals ore the same as ours would sharethis feeling and would be distressed at the failure to agree ona forward-looking enterprise at a time when agreement between countries outside the Hus&apos;sian sphere of influence has a special importance.      In particular,  the Governments of commonwealth countries, some of whom share to varying degrees our apprehensionsabout this or that provision in the draft Charter,  have made itclear that they attach great value to the setting up of anInternational Trade Organisation.      The Western Europeans have throughout the Conference demonstrated their anxiety to come to onagreement in order not to run any&apos;risks in connection withMarshall Aid.      In this connection it should be noted that there
is nothing in the draft Charter which is inconsistent with theideals of economic co-operation with Western Europe;    on the.contrary amendments to the Geneva - draft have been secured which make it easier to achieve Customs Unions or similar arrangements.Attitude to be adopted by the United Kingdom1h. In the light of the above considerations doubts thatmay still exist as to the lack of positive advantage to our export trade must take second place.      If we were to stand out at this stage we should do so practically alone.      The americans would undoubtedly be able to cast the odium of breakdown on us and thereby gain credit with all the under-developed countries,including nearly all the Latin-Americans and probably India and ceylon as well.      We should also have increased the risk that the americans would not be able to carry through their programme of reducing their own tariff which is very much in our own long turmeconomic interest (Mr.  Truman^ message to Congress on 1st March,1948, asking for renewal of their Reciprocal Trade AgreementsAct referred to the setting up of the International trade organisation as an integral port of this programme).     Finallywe should hove no support from the Commonwealth, not even on thequestion of new preferences.Recommendoti ens(1)    Signature of the Final Act15. I recommend therefore- that the United Kingdom Delegateshould sign the Final Act without reservation,  provided thatthere is no worsening of the position on new preferences as described in paragraphs 10 and 11, and subject to a satisfactory settlement on non-discrimination (see paragraph 12).      In hisfinal speech however he should indicate that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will need to make considerable use of the latitudeprovided for in respect of non-discrimination in the early yearsand that if the balance of payments crisis now upon us growsworse and not better,  it may become impossible for a great many countries to observe even the present rules.      In order to make clear our anxieties about the rules relating to new preferences,he should add that we look forward to the setting up of anInternational Trade Organisation and will bend our endeavours to making it a live instrument for economic progress.      Our cowerto do so, however, will,  in common with that of every other country, be conditioned by the good sense with which theOrganisation undertakes the difficult task of giving practical effect to the many complicated, rules and discretions in the charter.(2)    Consequential amendments to the General Agreement16. If the. Havana Conference comes to a successful conclusion, consequential amendments to the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (which do not in any way affect the commitmentswe have mode) will be needed.      These are described in Appendix 11and I ask for my colleagues&apos;  approval.H.W.Board of Trade, S.W.1.,12th March,  19U-8. .

appendix 2.&quot; 154This Appendix indicates the effect of changes, whicharc substantial but not radical, in certain provisionsof the Charter, and gives the new texts of those provisions.(a) Tariffs and Preferences-The Article relating to Reduction of Tariffs and Elimination of Preferences(Article 17) has been amended to read as in the text given below.     The effectof the amendments is to claboro.tc- the provisions governing the procedure of tariff negotiations and the steps which can be taken if any Member fails to make adequate concessions.Article- 17Reduction cf Tariffs and Elimination of Preferences1.   Each Member shall, upon the request of any other Member or Members, andsubject to procedural arrangements established by the Organisation, enter into and carry out with such other Member or Members negotiations directed to the substantial reduction of the general levels of tariffs and other charges on imports and exports and to the elimination of the preferences referred to inparagraph 2 of Article 16, on a reciprocal and mutually advantageous basis.2.   The negotiations provided for in paragraph 1 shall proceed in accordancewith the following rules:(a) Such negotiations shall be conducted on a selective product-by-product basis which will afford an adequate opportunity to take into account the needs of individual countries and individual industries.     Members shall be free not to grant concessions on particular products and, in tbe granting of a concession, theymay either reduce the duty, bind it at its then existing level,or undertake not to raise it above a.specified higher level.(b) Wo Member shall be required to grant unilateral concessions, orto grant concession to other Members without receiving adequateconcessions in return. Account shall be taken of the value toany Member of obtaining in its own right and by direct obligationthe indirect concessions which it would otherwise enjoy only by virtue of Article 16.(c) In the negotiations relating to any specific product(i) when a reduction is negotiated only in the nost-favoured-nationrate, such reduction shall operate automatically to reduce oreliminate the margin of preference applicable to that product;(ii) when a reduction is negotiated only in the preferential rate,the most-favoured-nation rate shall automatically be reduced tothe extent of such reduction;(iii) when it is agreed that reductions will be negotiated in boththe most-favoured9nation rate and the preferential rate, thereduction in reduction in each shall be that agreed by theparties to the negotiations j(iv) no margin of preference shall be increased.(d) The binding against increase of low duties or of chxty-free treataentshall in principle be- recognized as a concession equivalent in value to the substantial reduction of high duties or the elimination of tariff preferences.(e) Prior international obligations shall not be invoked to frustrate the requirement under paragraph 1 of this Article to negotiate with respecttp preferences, it being understood that agreements which result from such negotiations and v/hich conflict with such obligations shall not require the modification or termination of such obligations except(i) with the consent of the parties to such obligations, or, in theabsence of such consent, (ii) by modification or temination of suchobligations in accordance with their terms. /3.
.3.   The negotiations leading to the G-cneral Agreement on Tariff    and Trade,concluded at Geneva on 30 October 1947, shall be deemed to be negotiationspursuant to this Article,     The concessions agreed upon as a result ofall other negotiations completed by a Member pursuant to this Jurticle shallbe incorporated in the C-encral Agreement on terms to be agreed with the partiesthereto.     If any Member enters into any agreement relating to tariffs orpreferences, which is not concluded pursuant to this Article, the negotiationsleading to such agreement shall nevertheless conform to the requirementsof paragraph 2 (c) of this Article,4, (a) The Provisions of Article 16 shall not prevent the operation ofparagraph 5(b) of Article XXV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,and shall cease to require the application to the trade of any Member whichhas failed to become a parby to the General Agreement within two years fromthe entry into force of this Charter for such Member of the concessions embodied in the relevant Schedule of the General Agreement by any other Member which hasrequested such Member to negotiate with a view to becoming     a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and has failed to reach an agreement to this end with such Member:   Provided that the Organisationby a majority vote may require such continued application to any Member whichhas been unreasonably prevented from becoming a party to the General Agreementpursuant to negotiations in accordance with the provisions of this article,(b) If a Member which is a contracting party proposed to withhold tariff concessions from the ireland.de of a Member not a party to the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it shall give notice in writing to the Organisation andto the Affected Member, which may request the Organisation to require thecontinuance of such concessions, and if such a request has been made thetariff concessions shall not be withheld pending a decision by the organisation under paragraph lr (a).(c) In any judgment as to whether a Maabcr has been unreasonably prevented from becoming a party to the General Agreement, and in any judgment under chapter VIII as to whether a Member has failed without sufficient justificationto fulfil its obligations under this article, the Organisation shall haveregard to all relevcnt circumstances, including the developmental,reconstruction and other needs and the general fiscal structures of the member countries concerned and to the provisions of the Charter as a whole.     If infact such concessions are withheld, so as to result in the application to thetrade of the other Member of Tariffs higher than would otherwise have beenapplicable, such other Member shall then be free, within sixty days after suchaction becomes effective, to give written notice of withdrawal from theOrganisation.     The withdrawal shall take effect upon the expiration ofsixty days from, the day on which such notice is received by the Organisation.Interpretative NotesArticle 17It is understood that an internal tax (other than a general tax uniformlyapplicable to a considerable number of products) which is ajjplied to a productnot produced domestically in substantial quantities would be treated as a customs duty under this Article in any case in which a tariff concession on the productwould not be of substantial value unless accompanied by a binding or areduction of the tax.Sub-paragraph 2 (d)In the event of the devaluation of a member s currency, or of a risein prices, the effects of such devaluation or rise in prices would be a matter for consideration during negotiations in order to determine, first, thechange, if any, in the protective incidence of the specific duties, of theMamber concerned and, secondly, whether the binding of such specific dutiesrepresents in fact a concession equivalent to value to the substantial reductionof&quot;high duties or the elimination of tariff preferences.
2,     The exemption of exported products from duties or taxes i,.v osed inrespect of like products when consumed domestically, or the remission ofsuch duties or taxes in amounts not in excess of those which have accrued,shall not be construed to be in conflict with the provisions of paragraph 1of this-Article,     The use of the proceeds of such duties or taxes to make payments to domestic producers in general of those products shall beconsidered as a case under article 25,3.     Members shall give effect to the provisions of paragraph 1 of thisArticle at the earliest practicable date, but not later than two years fromthe day on which this Charter enters into force.     If any Member considersitself unable to do so in respect of any particular product or products,it shall, at least three months before the expiration of such period, give notice in writing to the Organization, requesting a specific extension ofthe period.     Such notice shall be accompanied by a full analysis of thesystem in question and the circumstances justifying it.     The Organizationshall then determine whether, and if so on what terms, the extensionrequested should be made,4,     Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article, anyMember may subsidize the exports of any product to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to offset a subsidy granted by a non-Memberaffecting the Member^ exports of the product.     However, the Member shall,upon the^request of the Organization or of any other Member which considersthat its interests are seriously prejudiced by such action, consult withthat Member or with the Organization with a view to reaching a satisfactoryadjustment of tho matter,A.The Articles relating to Subsidies, articles 25/29 in Cmd 7212, havebeen attended to   read as in the text given below.     The effect of the amendments is to give greater freedom in the use of export subsidies onprimary commodities but to strengthen the provisions designed to preventthe member subsidizing such commodities from acquiring more than an equitableshare of world trade.Article 25Subsidies in Gcncral-fIf any Member grants or maintains any subsidy, including any form of income or price support, which operates directly or indirectly to maintainor increase exports of any products from, or to roducc, or prevent anincrease in, imports of any product into, its territory, the Member shallnotify the Organization in writing of the extent and nature of thesubsidization, of the estimated effect of the subsidization on the quantityof the affected product or products imported into or exported from theterritory of the Member and of the circumstances making the subsidizationnecessary.     In any case in which a Member considers that serious prejudice to its interests is caused or threatened by any such subsidization, the member granting the subsidy shall, upon request, discuss with the other member or Members concerned, or with the Organization, the possibility of limiting the subsidization.Article 26Additional Provisions on Export Subsidesi.     No Member shall grant, directly or indirectly, any subsidy on the exportof any product, or establish or maintain any other system, which subsidy orsystem results in the sale of such product for export at a price lower thanthe comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in the domestic market, due allowance being mado for differences in the conditions and termsof sale, for differences in taxation, and for other differences affectingprice comparability.
-Article 27Special Treatment of Prir.ae.x-y Commodities1.     ia. system for the stabilisation of the domestic price or of the return of domestic producers of a primary commodity, independently of the movements of export prices, which results at times in the sale of the product for exportat a price lower than the comparable price charged for the like product tobuyers in the domestic market, shall be considered not to involve a subsidy on export within the nooning of paragraph 1 of .jrticle 26, if thoOrganization determines that(a) the system has also resulted, or is so designed as to result, inthe sale of the product for export at a price higher than the comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in the domestic market, and(b) the system is so operated, or is designed so to operate, either because of the effective regulation of production or otherwise,as not to stimulate exports unduly or otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of other members.2.     Any Member granting a subsidy affecting a primary commodity shallco-operate at all times in efforts to negotiate agreements under the procedures of Chapter VI.3,     In any case involving a primary commodity, if a Homber considers thatits interests would be seriously prejudiced by compliance with the provisionsof Article 26, or if a Member considers that its interests are seriouslyprejudiced by the granting of any form of subsidy, the procedure laid downin Chapter VI may be followed.     The member which considers that itsinterests are thus seriously prejudiced shall, however, be exempt provisionallyfrom tho requirements of paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 26 in respect ofthat commodity, subject to the provisions of -mrticlc 28,4,     No Member shall grant a new subsidy or increase an existing subsidyaffecting the export of a primary commodity during a commodity conferencecalled for the purpose of negotiating an inter-governmental control agreement for the commodity concerned unless the Organization concurs,    j*nysuch new or additional subsidy shall be subject to the provisions ofArticle 28,5,     If the meausre provided for in Chapter VI have not succeeded, or do notpromise to succeed, within a reasonable period of time, or if an agreement isinappropriate, any Member which considers that its interests are seriouslyprejudiced shall not be subject to the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 3 ofArticle 26 in respect of that commodity, subject to the provisions ofArticle 28,Article 28Undertaking Regarding Stimulation of Exports of Primary Commodities1,     Any Member granting any form of subsidy which operates directly or indirectly to maintain or increase the export of any primary commodity fromits territory shall not apply the subsidy in such a way as t o have theeffect of maintaining or acquiring for that Member more than an equitableshare of world trade in that coinmodity,2,     The Member granting such subsidy shall promptly notify the Organizationof the extent and nature of the subsidization, of the estimated effect ofthe subsidization on the quantity of the affected corxiodity exported fromits territory, and of the circumstances making the subsidization necessary.The Member shall promptly consult with any other Members which consider thatserious prejudice to their interests is caused or threatened by thesubsidization,3,     If, within a reasonable period of time, no agreement is reached in such consultation,    the Organization shall make a finding as to what constitutesan equitable share and the Member granting tho subsidy shall conform tothis finding, - /(b)
4.     In making its finding, tho Organization shall take into account anyfactors which may have affected, or may be affecting, world trade inthat priuary commodity, and shall have particular regard to(a) the Member&apos; s share of world trade in the commodity in a previous representative period(b) whether the - subsidizing Member&apos;s share of world trade inthe commodity is so small that the effect of the subsidy on such trade is likely to be of minor significance;(c) the degree of importance of the external trade in the commodity to the economy of the Member granting, and to the economies of the Members materially affected by, the subsidy;(d) tho existence of price stabilization systems in accordancewith paragraph 1 of Article 27;(e) the desirability of facilitating the gradual expansion ofproduction for export in those areas able to satisfy world market requirements of the commodity concerned in the most effective and economic manner, and therefore of limitingany subsidies or other measures which make that expansiondifficult,
(c)   Liquidation of non-commercial stocksA new Article 31A (Liquidation of non-commercial Stocks) has &quot;been, inserted in the State Trading Section of which the text is given &quot;below.     The effect is to provide safeguards against the dislocation likely to bo caused &quot;byliquidation of strategic stocks of primary commodities.Article 31A.Liquidation of Non-Commercial Stocks1.     If a Member holding stocks of any primary commodity accumulated for.,non-commercial purposes should liquidate such stocks, it shall carry out suchliquidation, as far as practicable, in a manner that will ivoid seriousdisturbance to world markets for the commodity concerned.2.     Any such Member shall:(a) give not less than four months public notice of its intentionto liquidate such stocks;   or(b) give not less than four months prior notice to the Organisationof such intention.3.     The Member concerned shall, at the request of any Member which considersitself substantially interested, consult as to the best means of avoidingsubstantial injury to the economic interests of producers and consumers ofthe primary commodity in question.     In cases where the interest of several members might be substantially affected, the Organization may participate insuch consultation, and the Member holding these stocks shall give due consideration to its recommendations.1+,     The provisions of paragraphs 1,2 and 3 shall not apply to routinedisposal of supplies necessary for the rotation of stocks to avoid deterioration.(d)   BoycottsThe Articlo relating to &quot;boycotts (Article 39) has been deleted.     Theeffect of this in conjunction with the other provisions of tho Charter as now drafted is that boycotts will either be dealt with under the provisionsregarding modification and impairment or, if connected with a disputereferred to the United Nations, will be remitted to that body and not considered by the I.T.O. (see provisions of Article 83A given below at (f)(e)   Tariff CommitteeThe article relating to the Tariff Committee has been deleted.     Theeffect of this is that tho functions which in earlier drafts were envisaged asfalling to the Tariff committee (supervision of tariff negotiations etc.)would be exercised by the Executive Board itself, subject to appeal to theConference of tho I.T.O.(f)   Relations with the United NationsA new Article 83A (Relations with the United Nations) has been inserted,tho text of which is given below.     This includes, in addition to provisionsregarding the relationship agreement between the I. T.O. and the United Nationstransferred from Article 84 in Cmd.7212, new provisions to avoid conflict of jurisdiction between the I.T.O. and the United Nations in regard to measuresconnected with political disputes.
0New Article (83a)Relations with the United nations[f,    The Organization shall he brought into relationship with the United Nationssoon as practicable as one of the specialized agencies referred to inarticle 57 of the Charter of the United Nations.     This relationship shall beeffected by agreement to be approved by the Conference.I,   Any such agreement shall, subjoot to tho provisions of this Charter, providefor effective co-operation and the avoidanoo of unnecessary duplication in tho&quot;activities of the respective organization, and for co-operation in furthering-the restoration and maintenance of international peace and security.I3,   In order to avoid conflict of responsibility between the United Nations and[the Organization with respect to political matters, any measure which isIdiroctly in connection with a political matter brought before the United NationsBin accordance with the Chapter IV or VI of the United Nations Charter shalliS deemed to fall within the scope of the United Nations, and shall not beubject to the provisions of this Charter.,   No action, taken by a member in pursuance of its obligations under theaited Nations Charter for the restoration and maintenance of internationaleace and security, shall be deemed to conflict with the provisions pf thisharter.Interpretative Note(a) If any Member raises the question whether a measure taken under paragraph 3 of this Article is in fact directly in connection with apolitical matter brought before the United Nations in accordance with theterms of Chapter IV or Chapter VT of the United Nations Charter, theresponsibility for making a determination on the question shall rest withths International Trade Organization, but if political issues beyond thocompetence of the Organization are involved the question shall bo deemedto fail within the scope of the United Nations.(b) If a Member which has no direct political concern in the matterbrought before the United Nations finds that a measure taken under paragraph 3. of this Article&apos; nullifies or impairs any benefit accruing toit directly or indirectly in the absence of such measures, it shall seekredress only by recourse to the procedures laid down in Chapter VTII ofthe Charter of tho International Trade Organization.
APPENDIX 3Customs Unions and steps towards Customs UnionsThe Customs Union Article as now drafted provides a satisfactoryframework for the formation of Customs Unions and for the interim measuresleading to full Customs Unions.    Alterations made at Havana to the Genevatext will give us more room to manoeuvre in respect of preferences;   inparticular there is now a clause allowing for the possibility, in specialcircumstances, of departures from the strict interpretation of the main provisions.     The new text is given below.Article A2BCustoms Unions and free-trade areas.1o     Members recognise that the purpose of a Customs Union or of a free-trade area should be to facilitate trade between the parties to it and notto raise obstacles to the trade of other members with such parties.2.     The provisions of this chapter shall not therefore be oonstrued toprevent the formation of a Customs Union or the establishment of a free-trade area or the adoption of an interim agreement neoessary for the formation ofa Customs Union or a free-trade area;   provided that;(A)     With respect to a Customs Union, or an interim agreement leading to the establishment of a Customs Union, the duties and other regulations ofcommerce imposed at the institution of any such union or interim agreement in respect of trade with members of the organisation shall not on the wholebe higher or more restrictive than the general incidence of the duties and regulations of commerce applicable in the constituent territories prior tothe formation of such union or the adoption of such interim agreement, asthe case may be;(b) With respect to a free-trade area, or an interim agreementleading to the establishment of a free-trade area, the duties and otherregulations of oommeroe maintained in each of the constituent territories and applicable at the estaK ishment of such free-trade area, or the adoptionof   such interim agreement, to the trade of members not participating inthe   arrangement shall not be higher or more restrictive than thecorresponding tariffs and other regulations of commerce existing in thesame constituent territory prior to the establishment of the free-trade area, or interim agreement, as the case may be;   and(c) Any interim agreement referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b)above shall include plan and sohedule for the attainment of such a customs Union or the establishment of such free-trade area within areasonable length of time.3o     (A)     Any member   deciding to enter into a Customs Union or a free**trade area;   or an interim agreement leading to the formation of such a union or free-trade area, shall promptly notify the organisation and shall make available to it such information regarding the proposed union or free**trade area, as will enable the organisation to make such reports and reoommendationsto members as it may deem appropriate.(b)     If, after having studied the plans and schedules provided for inan interim agreement under paragraph 2, in consultation with the parties tothat agreement and taking due account of the information made availablein accordance with the terms of sub-paragraph (a) , the organisation findsthat such agreement is not like3y to result in a Customs Union or in theestablishment of a free-trade area within the period contemplated by the/parties
parties to the agreement or that such period is not a reasonableone, the organisation shall make recommendations to the partiesto the agreement.   If the parties are not prepared to modify theagreement in accordance with such recommendations they shall not maintain it in force or institute such agreement if it has notyet been concluded.(o)     Any substantial change in the plan or schedule shall be notified to the organisation which may request the members concerned to consult with it if the change seems likely to jeopardise or delay unduly the achievement of the Customs Union or the free-trade area.4*     For the purposes of this Charter:(a)     A Customs Union shall be understood to mean the substitution ofa single Customs territory for two or more customs territories, so that:(i)     Tariffs and other restrictive regulations of ocmmerce (exoept,where necessary, those permitted under Section b. of chapter IV and underArticle 43) are eliminated on substantially all the trade between theconstituent territories of the Union or at least on substantially all thetrade in products originating in such territories and(il)     Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5, substantially thesame tariffs and other regulations of commerce are applied by each of themembers of the Union to the trade of territories not included in the Unionj(b)     a free-trade area shall be understood to mean a group of two ormore customs territories in which the tariffs and other restrictiveregulations of commerce (except, where necessary, those permitted underSection b. of Chapter IV and under Article 43) between such territories are eliminated on substantially all the trade in products originating inconstituent territories of the free-trade areas5*    The preferences referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 16 shall not beaffected by the constitution of a Customs Union or a free-trade area but may be eliminated or adjusted by means of negotiations with membersaffected.     This procedure of negotiation with affected members shall, inparticular, apply to the elimination of preferences required to conform with the provisions of sub^-paragraphs (a)(i) and (b) of paragraph 4*69     The organisation may by a two-thirds majority of the members presentand voting approve proposals which do not fully comply with the requirementsof the preceding paragraphs, provided that they lead to the establishmentof a customs union or a free-trade area in the sense of this Article.
Colonial Acce s s i onUnder the Charter as drafted at Geneva the UnitedKingdom would, by accepting the Charter on &quot;behalf of the -United Kingdom have automatically committed the Colonies also.This might have &quot;been embarrassing to us,  since we could notcompel all colonial legislatures to undertake the obligations of the Charter.      As the result of pressure by us at Havanathe relevant article has now boon re-drafted to allow of separate accession by individual Colonies.The new text is given bolow.Article 99Territorial Application1. Each Government accepting this Charter does so inrespect of its metropolitan territory and of the other territories for which it has international responsibilityexcept such separate customs territories as it shall notifyto the Organisation at the time of its own acceptance.2. Each Member may at any time accept this Charter inaccordance with paragraph 1   of Article 98 on behalf of anyseparate customs territory excepted under paragraph 1  of thisArticle.-3. Each Member shall take such reasonable measures asmay be available to it to assure observance of the provisionsof thi*s Charter by the regional and local governments and authorities within its territory.
APPENDIX 5Quota Regulation for Agricultural ProductsArticle 20General Elimination of Quantitative Restrictions1. No prohibitions or restrictions other than duties,taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas,import or export licences or other measures,  shall be instituted or maintained by any Member on tho importation ofany product of any other Member country or on the exportation orsale for export of any product destined for any other member country.2. The provisions of paragraph 1  of this Article shallnot extend to the following:(a) export prohibitions or restrictions applied for theperiod necessary to present or relieve criticalshortages of foodstuffs or other products essentialto the exporting Member country;(b) import and export prohibitions or restrictionsnecessary to the application of standards or regulations for the classification, grading ormarketing of commodities in international trade;if,  in the opinion of the Organisation,  the standardsor regulations adapted by a Member under this sub-paragraph have an unduly restrictive effect on trade,the Organisation may request the Member to revise the standards or regulations;    provided that it shallnot request the revision of standards internationallyagreed under paragraph 7 of Article 38;(c) import restrictions on any agricultural or fisheriesproduct,  imported in any form, necessary to the enforcement  of governmental measures which operate effectively:&apos;   (i)    to restrict the quantities of the like domestic product permitted to be marketed or produced,or,  if there is no substantial domestic production of the like product,  of a domesticagricultural or fisheries product for whichthe imported product can bo directlysubstituted;    or(ii)    to remove a temporary surplus of the likedomestic product,  or,   if there is no substantial domestic production of the likeproduct,  of a domestic product for which the imported products can be directly substituted,by making the surplus available to certaingroups of domestic consumers free of chargeor at prices below the current market level;or(iii)    to restrict the quantities permitted to beproduced of any animal product the productionof which is directly dependent, wholly or mainly,  on the imported commodity,  if the domestic production of that commodity is relatively negligible.
3* With, regard to import restrictions applied under theprovisions of sub-paragraph 2 (c):(a) such restrictions shall be applied only so long asthe governmental measures referred to in sub-paragraph2 (c) are in force,  and when applied to the import of products, domestic supplies of which are available during only a part of the year,  shall not be applied in such a way as to prevent their import in quantitiessufficient to satisfy demand for current consumptionpurposes during those periods of the year when likedomestic products, or domestic products for which the imported product can be directly substituted,  arc notavailable;(b) any Member intending to introduce restrictions on theimportation of any product shall in order to avoid unnecessary damage to the interests of exporting countries give notice in writing,  as far in advance aspracticable,  to the Organisation and to Members having a substantial interest in supplying that product,  inorder to afford, such Members adequate opportunity for consultation in accordance with paragraphs 2  (d) and hof Article 22, before the restrictions enter into force.At the request of the importing Member concerned the notification and any information disclosed during these consultations shall be kept strictly confidential;(c) any Member &apos; applying such restrictions shall give publicnotice of tho total quantity or value of the productpermitted to be imported during a specified futureperiod and of any change in such quantity or value;(d) any restrictions applied under sub-paragraph 2 (c)(i)shall not be such as will reduce the total of importsrelative to tho total of domestic production, ascompared with tho proportion which might reasonably beexpected to rule between tho two in the absence of restrictions.      In determining this proportion,  the member shall pay due regard to tho proportion prevailingduring a previous representative period, and to anyspecial factors which may have affected or may beaffecting tho trade in the  product concerned.1+. Throughout this Section the terms &quot;import restrictions&quot;or &quot;export restrictions&quot; include restrictions made effectivethrough State-trading operations.Interpretative NotesSub-paragraph 2 (a)In the case of products which ore basic to diet in the exporting country and-which are subject to alternate annualshortages and surpluses, the provisions of this sub-paragraph donot preclude such export prohibitions or restrictions as orenecessary to maintain from year to year domestic stocks sufficientto avoid critical shortages.Sub-paragraph 2 (c).The term &quot;agricultural and fisheries product,  imported inany form,&quot;-means the product in the form in which it is originallysold by its producer,  and such processed forms of the productas are so closely related to the original product as regardsutilisation, that their unrestricted importation would make therestriction on the original product ineffective.
Sub-paragraph. 3 (&quot;o jThe provisions of Article 20 (3)  (b) with regard toprior consultation would not prevent a Member which had. given otherMembers a reasonable period of time for such consultation from introducing the restrictions at the date intended.      It is recognised that,  in the case of consultation with regard to import restrictions applied under sub-paragraph 2 (c)  (ii),  theperiod of advance notice provided would in some cases necessarily be relatively short.Sub-paragraph 3 (I)The term &quot;special factors&quot;  in sub-paragraph 3 (d)includes inter alia changes in relative productive efficiencyas between domestic and foreign producers, which may have occurred since the representative period.
APPENDIX 6Relations with non-members the general principle which has been adopted is that a member of theOrganisation may not grant to a non-member treatment more favourable than hegrants to another member (subject to all the complicated escape clauses of the charter).     This represents a substantial weakening of earlier drafts of the relevant Article under which the member would in certain circumstances havebeen precluded from offering to a non-member treatment as favourable as thatoffered to a member.     Tho same general principle is intended to apply asregards acceptance of benefits from a non-member.     In this case, however,the provision is drafted so that a member may not receive from a non-nemberpreferential or exclusive benefits which would damage the interest of another member.The new text is given below.ARTICLE 93RELATIONS WITH NON-MEMBERSNothing in this charter shall preclude any member from maintainingeconomic relations with non members.2.   Members recognise that subject to the provisions of Article 15 itwould be inconsistent with the purpose of this charter to seek any arrangements with non members for the purpose of obtaining for the trade of such memberspreferential treatment as compared with the trade of other members or so to conduct their trade with non members as to result in injury to other members.Accordingly;(A) No member shall enter into any now arrangement with a non memberwhich precludes the non member from extending to other members anybenefit provided for by such arrangement.(B) Subject to the provisions of Chapter IV no member shall extend totho trade of any non member treatment which being more favourable than that which it extends to any member injures the economic interests of another member.3.     Nothing in this charter shall be interpreted to require a member toextend to non members treatment as favourable as that which it extends to members under the provisions of the charter.     Failure tc extend such treatmentshall not be regarded as inconsistent with the terms or the spirit of thocharter..4.     The Executive Board shall make periodic studies of general problems arising out of commercial relations between members and non members and with aview to promoting the purpose of the charter, may make recommendations to theconference XV ITH rcsx^ect to such relations.     Any recommendation involving-alterations in provisions of this article shall be dealt with in accordance with article 95* *INTERPRETATIVE NOTE;The Sub-Committee agreed that nothing in Article 93 shall be construedto prejudice or prevent the operation of the provision cf Article 57(1)regarding the treatment to be accorded to non participating countries underthe terms of a commodity control agreement which conforms to the requirementsof Chapter VI.
APPENDIX 7Voting&apos; and the Executive Board^ There has been no support within the Conference for theUnited Kingdom proposal that decisions should &quot;be taken by theOrganisation on the basis of a system of weighted voting.      Theprinciple of &quot;one State,  one vote&quot; has been adopted (see text of Article 72 below)*      It is difficult to forecast how thissystem will work out in practice.      If the majority of tho Latincountries in particular finally ratify the Charter,  their votingstrength will be an important factor in the situation,  particularly since it will often be at the disposal of the U.3.A.   &apos;   &quot;Day to daydecisions by the Organisation will be in the hands of itsExecutive Board:    this will consist of 18 members,  all of whomwill be subject to re-election from time to time.      We have,however,  secured the useful bargain that eight of the seats onthe Executive Board shall be reserved for the countries of chiefeconomic importance having regard to international trade (see text of Article &quot;75 below).      The provision for re-election will onlyaffect one,  or possibly two, of these reserved seats and the UnitedKingdom, together with the other countries of major importance in international trade,  should be in no danger of losing,  in practice,a&apos; permanent seat on the Executive Board of the Organisation.    Inany case, it will be clear to other participating countries that a country like the United Kingdom, whoso prosperity is vitallydependent on international trade,  could not continue to be a memberof the Organisation if due account wore not taken of its special needs and views in all matters affecting the operations of theOrganisation.The new texts are given below.Article 72V oting1. Each Member shall have one vote in the Conference.2. Except as otherwise provided in the Charter, decisionsof the Conference shall be taken by a majority of the Memberspresent and voting,  provided that the rules of procedure of theConference may permit a Member to request a second vote if thenumber of votes cast is less than one-half of the Members of theOrganisation,  in which case the decision reached on the secondvote would be final whether or not the majority of votes castcomprises more than one-half of the Members of the Organisation.Article 75Composition of the Executive Board1. The Executive Board shall consist of the representativesof eighteen Members of the Organisation-selected by the Conference;provided that a customs union,  as defined in paragraph 1+ ofArticle h-2, may be so elected if all of its members ore Membersof the Organisation and if its members desire to be represented as a unit.
2. The Executive Board shall Be representative of the major geographical areas included within the membership of theOrganisation.      In selecting the members of the executive board, the Conference shall have regard to the objective of ensuring that the Board includes Members or customs unions of chief economic importance having particular regard to international trade, and is representative of the diverse types of economies or different degrees of economic developmentexisting within the membership of the Organisation.3*      (a)    At intervals of three years the Conference shall determine, by a two-thirds majority of the Memberspresent and voting,  the eight Members or customsunions of chief economic importance havingparticular regard to international trade.      such members or customs unions shall be declared membersof the Executive Board.(b) The other members of the Executive Board shall be elected by the Conference by a two-thirds majority ofthe Members present and voting.(c) If on two consecutive ballots no member is elected,the remainder of the election shall be by a majorityof the Members present and voting.1+. The term of a member of the Executive Board shall be three years, except that, at the first election,  the provisionsof Annex&apos;XK shall apply.      Any vacancy in the Board shall be filled by the Conference for the unexpi red term of the vacancy.5. The Conference shall establish rules for giving effectto the provisions of this Article.s Not reproduced.
APPENDIX    8Article    13Governmental Assistance to Economic development . The Members recognise that special governmentalassistance may bo required to promote the establishment,development or reconstruction of particular industries,  or particular branches of agriculture,  and that in appropriatecircumstances the grant of such assistance in the&quot; form ofprotective measures is justified.   At the sane time theyrecognize that an unwise use of such measures would imposeundue burdens on their own economics, unwarranted restrictionson international trade and might increase unnecessarily thedifficulties of adjustment for the economies of other countries.2.      (a)    If a Member in the interest of its economic develop-ment or reconstruction or for the purpose ofincreasing a most-favou red-notion rate of duty inconnection with the establishment of a new-preferential agreement in accordance with Article 15considers it desirable to adopt any non-diac r iminat crymeasure affecting imports which would conflict withany obligation which tho Member has assumedthrough negotiations with any other Member or members pursuant to Chapter IV, hut which wouldnot conflict with the provisions of that Chapter,such Member(i)    shall enter into direct negotiations withall the other Members which havecontractual rights with a view to obtaining agreement.    The Members shallbe free to proceed in accordance withthe terms of any such agreement, providedthat the Organisation is informed ofthe results of the negotiations;    or(ii)  shall initially or may in theevent of failure to reach agreement under sub-paragraph (i) above apply to the organisation.    The Organisation shall determine,  from among Members which havecontractual rights,  the Member or Membersmaterially affected by the proposedmeasure and shall sponsor negotiations between the applicant Member and theseMembers with a view to obtainingexpeditious and substantial agreement.The Organization shall establish andcommunicate to the Members concerned atime schedule for such negotiations,following as far as practicable any timeschedule which may have boon proposed,-. by the applicant Member.    The members shall commence and proceed continuouslywith such negotiations in accordance with
the time schedule laid down by theOrganisation.   At the request of aMember the Organisation may, where itconcurs * in principle with the proposedmeasure, assist in the negotiations.Upon substantial agreement being reached,the applicant Member may be released bythe Organisation from the obligationreferred to in this paragraph,&quot;subjectto such limitations as may have beenagreed upon in the negotiations betweentho Members concerned.(b)    If as a result of action initiated under thisparagraph, ,there should be an increase in thoimportations of the product or products concerned,including-products which can be directlysubstituted therefor, which if continued wouldbe so great as to jeopardise substantially the plans of the applicant Member for the ostablish-ment, development or reconstruction of thoindustry,  industries or branches of agricultureconcerned, and if no preventive moosuresconsistent with this Charter can be found which seem likely to prove effective,  the applicantMember may, after informing, and when practicableconsulting with tho Organisation, adopt such other measures as the situation may require;Provided- that ouch measures do not restrict imports more than necessary to offset theincrease in imports referred to in this sub-paragraph.    Except in unusual circumstances,such measures shall not reduce imports below thelevel obtaining in the most recent representativeperiod preceding the date on which the Memberinitiated action under sub-paragraph (a) ofthis paragraph.    The Organisation shall determine,as soon as practicable, whether such measures should be continued, discontinued or modified.Such measures shall in any case be terminatedas soon as the Organization determines that there-negotiations are completed or discontinued.It is recognized that the contractual relationshipsreferred to in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraphinvolve reciprocal advantages, and therefore anyother Member which has a contractual right inrespect of the product to which such actioairelates, and whose trade is materially affectedby the action, may suspend the application tothe trade of such Member of such substantiallyequivalent obligations or concessions under chapter IV, the suspensions of which the organisation does not disapprove.    Any Memberintending &quot;to suspend such application shallconsult the Organisation before doing so.3. In the case of any non-discriminatory measureaffecting imports which would conflict not only with any^obligation which the Member has assumed through negotiationswith any other Member&apos; or Members pursuant to chapter IV, but
also with the provisions of that Chapter; tho provisions ofparagraph 2(a)  (ii) shall apply; - Provided that beforegranting a release the Organization shall afford adequateopportunity for all Members which it determines to be materially affected to express their views.    The provisionsof paragraph 2(b)  shall also be applicable in this co.se.h.      (a)    If a Member in tho interest of its economic development or reconstruction considers itdesirable to adopt any non-discriminatory measureaffecting imports which would conflict with any provision of Chapter IV, hut would not conflict with any obligation which the Member has assumedthrough negotiations with any other Member or members pursuant to Chapter IV,  such applicantMember shall so notify tho Organisation andshall transmit to the Organization a written statement of the considerations in support ofthe adoption,  for a specified period, of thepropose d me a sur e.(b)    The Organization, shall concur in&apos; the proposedmeasure and grant release from such provision-for a specified period if, having particular regard to the applicant Member&apos;s need for economic development or reconstruction^  it is established that the measure(i)    is designed to protect a branch ofindustry, established between 1st January, 1939, and the do.to of signature of the Final Act of the&apos; . present Charter,  which was protectedduring that period of its development by abnormal conditions arising outof the war;    or(ii)    is designed to promote the establishmentor development of a branch of industry for the processing of an indigenousprimary commodity, when the externalsales of such commodity have beenmaterially reduced as a result of new or increased restrictions imposedabroad;    or(iii)    is necessary in view of the possibilitiesand resources of the applicant member to promote the establishment ordevelopment of a branch of industry for the processing of an indigenousprimary commodity,;,  or for theprocessing of &apos;a by-product of such a branch of industry which would other-wise be wasted, in order to achieve a fuller and more economic utilizationof the applicant Member&apos;s natural resources and man-power and, in the long-run,  to raise the standard of living-wit hin the territory of the applicantMember and is unlikely to have a harmfuleffect in the long run, on inter-national trade;    or
(iv)    is unlikely&apos;tc be more restrictive ofinternational trade than any otherpracticable and reasonable measurepermitted under this Charter whichcould be imposed without unduedifficulty and is the one most suitablefop the purpose having regard to theeconomics of the branch cf industry or agriculture concerned and tc thoapplicant Member&apos;s need far economic development or reconstruction.Provided that(i)    any proposal by the applicant member to apply any such measure, with or without modification after the endof the initial period, shall not besubject to the provisions of this sub-paragraph;    and(ii)    the Organisation sho.ll not concur inany measure under the provisions of sub-paragraphs (i), (ii)  or (iii)which is likely tc com so seriousprejudice to exports of a primarycommodity on which the economy of another Member is largely dependent.The applicant Member shall apply all measuresundor this sub-paragraph in such a way as to avoid unnecessary .damage to the commercial or economic interests of any ether Member.If the proposed measure does not fall within theprovisions of sub-paragraph (b),(i)    the Member may enter into directconsultations with the Member or members which,  in its judgment, willbe materially affected by the measure,with a view to obtaining agreement.At the same time, the Member shallinform the Organisation of theproposed measure and of the consul-tations relative thereto in order to afford the Organization an opportunityto determine whether all materiallyaffected. Members are included within- such consultations.   Upon complete orsubstantial agreement being reached,the Member interested in taking themeasure shall apply to the organisation for release.

APPENDIX    9Article   15Preferential arrangcmonts for Econanlg DcvelopmentThe Members recognise that special circumstances,including the need for economic development or reconstruction,may justify new preferential agreements between two or morecountries    in the interest of the programmes of economic development or reconstruction of one or more cf them.2. Any Member or Members contemplating the conclusionof such an agreement shall camaunicate their intention totho Organization and provide it with the relevant information to enable it to consider the contemplated agreement.    the organisation shall promptly communicate such information toall Membe rs.3* The Organization shall examine the proposal and,subject to such conditions as it may impose, -may, by a two-thirds majority of the Members present and voting, grant an exception to tho provisions of Article 16 to permit&quot;&apos;theproposed arrangements to be made.h. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3,the Organization shall permit the necessary departure fromthe provisions of Article 16, in accordance with the provisionsof paragraphs 5 and 6, in respect of a proposed agreement bctwocnMembers for the establishment of tariff preferences which itdetermines to fulfil the following conditions and requirementsx(a) the territories of the parties to the agreement shall be contiguous one with another, or all parties shall belong to tho same economic region;(b) any tariff preference provided for in the agreement is necessary to ensure a sound and adequate market for a branch of industry or agriculture which isbeing or is to be created or reconstructed orsubstantially developed or substantially modernised;(c) the parties to the agreement undertake to grantfree entry for tho product or products of the branch of industry or agriculture reformed to in sub-paragraph (b)  or to apply to such productscustom duties sufficiently low to ensure that the objectives provided for in sub-paragraph (b)shall be achieved;(d) any compensation granted to the othor parties bythe party receiving preferential treatment shall,if it is a preferential concession, conform withthe provisions of this paragraph;(e) the agreement contains provisions permitting the adherence of other Members, which are able to qualify as parties to the agreement under theprovisions of this paragraph,  in the interest oftheir programmes of economic development orreconstruction on terms and conditions to be-1-
determine-3, &quot;by nog.:tioti :n with the parties tc theagreement.   The provisions of Chapter VIII may be invoked by such a Member in this respect only, onthe, ground that it has been unjustifiably excludedfrom participati :-n in such an agreement;&quot;(f)    the agreement contains provisions; ns for its terminationaccording to its purposes and within a periodnecessary for the fulfilment of such purposesbut in any case not more than ten years, providedthat any renewal shall be subject tc the approvalof the Organisation and shall not be for periodsgreater than five years each.5. When the Organisation, upon the application of aMember,  approves a margin of preference in accordance with paragraph 6, as an exception to Article 16 in respect of the products covered by the proposed agreement,  it may, as acondition of its approval, require a reduction in an unboundmost-favoured-naticn rate of duty proposed by the Member inrespect of any product so: covered, if in. the light of the representations of any affected Member it considers that rateexcessive.6.    (a)    If the Organisation finds that the contemplatedagreement fulfills tho conditions set forth inparagraph L\. and that the conclusion of theagreement is not likely to injure substantially the interests of Members nod. parties to theagreement, it shall within two months authorisethe parties tc the agreement to depart from theprovisions of Article 16 as regards the productscovered, by the agreement *    If the Organizationdoes not give a ruling within the specified period,the authorization of the Organization shall beconsidered automatically received.(b)    If the Organization finds that the agreement, whilefulfilling the conditions set forth in paragraph h,is likely to cause substantial injury to the external trade of a Member not party to the agreemen-the Members contemplating tho agreement may enterinto negotiations with that Member.   When agreement is reached in the negotiations,  the Organizationshall authorize the Members contemplating the preferential agreement to depart from the provisionsof Article 16 as regards the products covered bythe preferential agreement.    If, within two months from tho date on which the Organisation suggestedsuch negotiations,  the negotiations have failedand the Organisation considers that the injuredMember is unreasonably preventing the conclusionof the negotiations it shall permit the necessarydeparture from the provisions of Article 16 byfixing a fair compensation to be granted by theparties to the agreement to the injured Member or,if this is not possible or reasonable, by orderingsuch modification of the agreement as will give such Member fair treatment.    The provisions of chapter VIII may be invoked by such Member only ifit does not. accept the decision of the Organizationregarding such compensation. -
(c) If the Organisation finds that the agreement whilefulfilling the conditions set forth in paragraph 4is likely to jeopardise seriously the economic position of a Member in world trade, it shall not agree to an;-- departure from tho provisions of&apos; Article 16 unless tho parties to. tho agreementhave reached a mutually satisfactory understanding with that Member *(d) If the Organisation finds that tho prospectiveparties to a regional preferential agreement have,before 21st November, 1947, obtained from countriesrepresenting at least two-thirds of their importtrade, the right to depart from most-favoured-nation treatment in the cases envisaged in the agreement,tho Organisation shall, without prejudice tc theconditions governing such recognition, grant theauthorization provided for in paragraph 5 and in sub-paragraph (a)  of this paragraph, provided thatthe conditions sot out in sub-paragraphs (c.), (e)and (f)  of paragraph 4 are fulfilled.    Nevertheless,if the Organisation finds that the external  trade of one or more-Members, which have not recognised,this right to depart from most-favoured-nation treatment,  is threatened, with substantial injury,it shall invite the parties to the agreementtc enter into negotiations with the Injured. Member,and the procedure of sub-paragraph (b) above shallapply.INTERPRETATIVE NOTESParagraph 4(a)The Organization need not interpret the terra&quot;economic region&quot; to require close geographical proximity ifit is satisfied that a sufficient degree of economic integrationexists between the countries concerned.Paragraph 6(d)It is understood that the words &quot;have, before-rc 21stNovember, 1947. obtained, from countries representing at least two-thirds of their import trade, the right to depart from most-favoured-nation treatment for the purpose of establishingregional preferences as envisaged in the agreement&quot; coverrights to conclude preferential agreements which may have-been recognised in respect of mandated territories which becameindependent before 21st November, 1947* in so far as thoserights have not been specifically denounced before that date.
APPENDIX 10Text of Article 23 for purposes ofillustration (not yet agreed).Article 23 - Exceptions to the rule of non-discrimination1.    (a) The members recognise that the aftemath of the war has brought difficult problems of economic adjustment which do not permit the immediate full achievement of non discriminatory administration of quantitative   restrictions and thereforerequire the exceptional transitional period arrangement set forth in this paragraph.(b) A member applying restrictions under Article 21 nay in the use of such restrictions, deviate from the provisions of Article 22 in a manner havingiequivalent effect to restrictions on payments and transfers for current internationaltransactions which that member may at that time apply under Article XIV of thearticles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund, or under an analogousprovision of a special exchange agreement pursuant to Article 24 paragraph 6.(c) A member applying restrictions under Article 21 and which was applyingimport restrictions to safeguard its balance of payments on 15th February 1946 in a manner which deviated from the rules of non discrimination set forth in Article 22may, to the extent that such deviation would not have been covered on that date by sub- paragraph (b) of this paragraph, continue so to deviate and may adapt suchdeviation to changing circumstances.     The Organisation may, if it deems such action: necessary in exceptional circumstances, make representations to any memberdeviating from the provisions of Article 22 pursuant to this sub paragraph, that conditions are favourable for the termination of any particular deviation, or forthe general termination of such deviation.     The member shall be given a suitabletine to reply to such representations.     If the organisation thereafter finds thatthe member persists in unjustifiable deviation from the previsions of Article 22the member shall, within 60 days limit or terminate such deviations as theorganisation nay specify.(d) Any member who was a contracting party to the G.A.T.T. on the15th February, 1948, and who by written notice addressed to the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations not later than the 15th March, 1948, declared that itreserved the right of election, may elects when the Charter becomes applicable toit, to be governed by the provisions of Annex AA instead of the provisions of sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph.,     Annex AA shall not authorise anydeviation from the provisions of Article 22 by any members who do not so elect.Sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall not be applicable to anymember which does so elect.(e) The policies applied in the use of import restrictions under sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) or pursuant to sub-paragraph (d) and Annex AA of thisparagraph in the post war transitional period shall be designed to promote themaximum development of multilateral trade possible during that period and to expedite the attainment of a balance of payments position which will no longerrequire resort to Article 21.(f) No member shall deviate from the provisions of Article 22 pursuant to sub paragraphs (b) or (c) of this paragraph or pursuant to sub paragraph (d) and annex AA except during the post war transitional period arrangement for that member pursuant to Article XIV of the articles of agreement of the international monetary Fund   or pursuant to analogous provision of a special exchange agreement under Article 24 paragraph 6.2.     Notwithstanding the termination of the members transitional period arrange-ment pursuant to sub paragraph 1(e) of this Article, a member which is applyingimport restrictions under Article 21 may, with the consent of the organisation,temporarily deviate from the principles of Article 22 in respect of a small partof its trade where the benefits to the member or members concerned substantiallyoutweigh any injury which may result to the trade of other members.
ipi    The provisions of Article 22 shall not preclude restrictions in[accordance with Article 21 which are applied against imports from other[countries, but not as among themselves, by groups of territories having ajponnon quota in the International Monetary Fund on condition that such restrictions are in all other respects consistent with Article 22.A member applying import restrictions ,under Article 21 shall not heprecluded by this section &quot;from applying measures to direct its exports iniiuch a manner as to increase its earnings of currencies which it can useWithout deviation from Article 22.\u     A member shall not be precluded by this section from applying- quantitative restrictions (a) having equivalent effect to exchange restrictions authorised&apos;indor Section 3(b) of Article VII of the articles of agreement of the[international Monetary Fund- or (b) under the prefereotial arrangementsijaroyided for in Annex A of this Charter, pending the outcome of the negotiationsjteferred to therein. &apos;
ANiJEX AA1 .     (a) The Members recognise that when a substantial and widespreaddisequilibrium prevails in international trade and payments a Memberapplying restrictions under Article 21 nay be able to increase itsimports from certain sources without unduly depleting its monetaryreserves, if permitted to depart from the provisions of Article 22.The members also recognise the- need for close limitation of suchdepartures so as not to handicap achievement of multilateral international trade,(b) Accordingly, when a substantial and widespread disequilibriumprevails in international trade and payments a Member applying import restrictions under Article 21 may relax such restrictions in a manner which departs from the provisions of Article 22 to the extent necessaryto obtain additional imports above the maximum total of imports which itcould afford in tho light of the requirements of paragraph^ of Article 21if its restrictions were fully consistant with Article 22;    provided that(i) levels of delivered prices for products so importedare not established substantially higher than thoseruling for comparable goods regularly available fromother Members, and that any excess of such price levels for pri.ducts so imported is progressively reduced over a reasonable period;(ii) the Member taking such action does not do so as partof any arrangement by which the gold or convertible-currency which tho Member currently receives directly or indirectly from its exports to other Members notparty to the arrangement is appreciably reduced below the level it could otherwise have been reasonably expected to attain;(iii) such action does not cause unnecessary damage tothe conmerci?.l or economic interests of any other member.(c) Any Member taking action under this paragraph shall observe the principles of sub-paragraph (b) of this paragraph.     A Member shalldesist from transactions which prove to be inconsistent with that sub-paragraph but the Member shall not be required to satisfy itself, whenit is not practicable to do so,  that the requirements of that sub-paragraph are fulfilled in respect of individual transactions.(d) Members undertake in framing ana carrying out any programmes for additional imports under this paragraph to pay due regard to theneed to facilitate the termination of any exchange arrangements whichdeviate from the obligations of Sections 2, 3 and 4 of Article viii of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund and tothe need to restore equilibrium in their balances of payments on a sound and lasting basis.2.     Any Member taking action under paragraph 1  of this Article shallkeep the Organisation regularly informed regarding such action andshall provide such available relevant information as the organisaion may request.3.      (a) Not later than 1 March 1952 (five years after the date onwhich the International Monetary Fund began operations) and in eachyear thereafter, any Member maintaining or proposing to instituteaction under paragraph 1  of this Article shall seek the approval ofthe Organisation, which shall thereuvjon determine whether thecircumstances of the Member.justify the maintenance or institution of Action by it under paragraph I of this Article.     After 1 March1952 no Member shall maintain or institute such action withoutdetermination by the- Organisation that the Member&apos;s circumstancesjustify the maintenance or institution of such action, as the case may be, and that subsequent maintenance or institution of suchaction by the Member shall be subject to any limitations which the/Organisation
Iirganisation nay prescribe for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of paragraph I of this Article;   Provided thatthe Organisation shall not require that prior approval be obtained for individual transactions.(b) If at any tine the Organisation finds that import restrictionsjare being applied by a Member in a discriminatory manner inconsistentith the exceptions provided for under paragraph I of this Article,[the Member shall, within sixty days, remove the discrimination ormodify it as specified by the Organisation;     Provided that any action under Paragraph I of this Article, to the extent that it has beenapproved by the Organisation under sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraphbr to the extent that it has been approved by the Organisation at therequest of a Member under a procedure analogous to that of paragraph 4(c)jpf Article 21, shall not bo open to challenge under this sub-paragraphjor under paragraph 4(d) of Article 21 on the ground that it is inconsistent with Article 22.(c) Not later than 1 March 1950, and in each year thereafter solong as any Members are taking action under paragraph I of this Article,the Organisation shall report on the action still taken by Members underjjfchat paragraph.     On or about 1 March 1952, and in each year thereafter!so long as any Members are taking action under paragraph I of thisIjfvrticle, and at such tines thereafter as the Organisation nay decide,the Organisation shall review the question of whether there then existsisuch a substantial and widespread disequilibrium in international tradeand payments as to justify resort to paragraph I of this Article byMembers.     If it appears at any date prior to 1 March 1952 that there hasjbeen a substantial and general improvement in international trade and[payments, the Organisation nay review the situation at that date.   If,las a result of any such review, the Organisation determines that no suchIjclisequilibriun exists, the provisions of paragraph I of this article shall be suspended, and all actions authorised thereunder shall ceaseisix months after such determination.Mote:-   It was understood that a member operating in accordance withthe provisions of Article 43.1(b) would not be precluded from1 operation under this Article.
The General Agreement provides that when theInternational Trade Organisation Charter comes into force thoarticles in the General Agreement which correspond to Charterarticles shall he superseded unless any of the parties to theGeneral Agreement lodge an objection within sixty days of theend of tho Havana Conference,  in which case a meeting of theparties to the General Agreement would have to he held todecide how to moot the objection.   Seme of the countries,however, who took part in the negotiations at Geneva and whohave secured at&apos;Havana amendments to which they attach importance in the draft Charter, have represented that itwould be invidious and embarrassing if they could not say at once that the General Agreement would be amended inconformity.    On the assumption that wo are prepared to sign the Final Act,  there scorns to bo no advantage in waiting forsixty days before wo decide that we will not object to the consequential amendments and accordingly it is desirablethat our Delegation at Havana should inform the other Genevacountries that we shall have no objection to raise underthe sixty days rule.2. As stated above, the actual amendments of theGeneral Agreement should, according to its terms,  take placewhen the Charter enters into force.    This provision was insertedwhen it was expected that it would bo possible to bring the charter into force during the course of tho year 19J+.8,    It now seems highly unlikely that (to take only one case) the americans will be able to pass the necessary legislation in time.    It isproposed, therefore, that the Geneva countries should draw upa protocol of amendment by which particular amandaents to theGeneral Agreement would come into force at fixed dates.    Theonly one of importance to us is the amendment tc the articlerelating to non-discrimination.    It will be remembered that atGeneva we secured complete freedom under the General Agreementthroughout 19^8.   If iho consequential amendment were made before the end of 1948, we should lose this freedom,  so that,while we can agree to the principle of fixed dates, we mustinsist that the now text on non-discrimination does not operate before 1st January, 1949*3. A further consequence of this will be that we shalllose a provision by which we could have secured complete freedom from non-discrimination rules by a simple majority vote for a further period after 19-1-8.    This provision wasinserted to cover the fact that wo had to apply the GeneralAgreement provisionally before the fate of the european recovery Programme was known.   We should, therefore, secure thatthe protocol agreeing to fixed, dates should not be final untilthe European Recovery Programme legislation has been passed by congress.    Wo retain, - in any case, the power to seek an amend-ment or suspension of the rules by a two-thirds majority.h. It should be remembered thro a solution of this point is necessary to enable us to solve the difficulty which arises in connection with Section Q of the Loan Agreement.APPENDIX_11Consequential lancndmonts tc the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade
