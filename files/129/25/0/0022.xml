fa^ures...........m...^rjJTj135tS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET- ^CP. (U8)  82 COPY NO.   j11TH MARCH, 1948CABINETEXCHEQUER CONTRIBUTION TOVYARDS PROFESSIONAL PEESINCURRED BY CLAIM/JITS FOR LOSS OF DEVELOPMENT VALUESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland,and the Minister of Town and Country- planning the Town and Country Planning Acts of 191+7 ineffect remove development value from owners of land as fromthe appointed day (now fixed as 1st July, 191+8) and  300 millionsis provided for payments to owners affected, to bo distributed in accordance with a Treasury scheme, not later than fivo yearshenco.    Owners who consider thoy are entitled to a share mustput in a claim.    It will bo the task of the Central Land Board,with tho technical assistance of the Valuation Office, todetermine, in each case what was the development value at theappointed   day and their determination will bo subject to arbitration.    Only when the bulk of this and other information is available will it be possible for the Treasury to frame thedistribution scheme.2. The time-table is very tight, and it is essentialthat the determination of development values - a vast task -should xorocoed 00 smoothly as possible.   The Central LandBoard could themselves estimate the development value in allcases, but it will be greatly to their advantage if ownersemploy competent professional advisers to act for them inall the technical work, i.e. (a) give an opinion as to thodevelopment value;    (b) negotiate with Government experts;    and(c) if necessary, appear at arbitration;    and owners should be encouraged to do so as much in the Government1 s interests asin their own.3. This will be greatly facilitated if the Governmentpay a contribution towards professional fees incurred byclaimants.   There are the further points (i) that such a payment would enable the scheme to start with the goodwill of the surveyors&apos; profession;    and. (ii) that there is muchto be said in equity for relieving private individuals - of costs which they would not have had to incur but for theaction of Parliament in depriving them of part of what theyown.   The matter was raised from the latter point of viow whenthe Bills wore before parliament, but though sympathetic consideration was promised no undertaking v/as given.-1-
U* The draft claim form includes an optional partasking for an- estimate of the development value certified by&quot;a person professionally experienced in the valuation ofland&quot;.    We propose that where such a person has been emplyed to give this certificate,  the payment in respect of professionalfees should bo made by the Central Land Board to the claimantwho would then settle with the professional adviser.   Thepayment would be related on the ordinary professional scaloto the development value as finally settled, and would be paid at that time.   The proposal is set out in more detail in the annex.5. It is impossible to estimate closely the cost ofthis proposal, but it would certainly be very great.    Itmay be as much as  lh millions.   Wc feel therefore that adecision by the Cabinet is called for.6. This memorandum is agreed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.A .W.L.S.11th March, 194&amp;.
annexEXCHEQUER CONTRIBUTIONS TQW/P.DS PROFESSIONAL FEESINCURRED BY CLABLANTS AGAINST THE  300 MILLIONS&quot;1. The contribution will bo made by the CentralLand Board and will be payable only if &quot;a person professionallyexperienced in the valuation of land5&apos; has boon employed inorder to fill in the optional part of the claim form and dothe necessary technical work.   It often happens in Scotland,and sometimes in England also, that solicitors arc themselvesaccustomed to do valuation work and the phrase is wide enoughto covor casos whore a solicitor completes the optional partof the form and does the necessary technical work.2. The payment will he made to the claimant andwill be on Rydos Scale plus one-third, on the development value as ascertained by agreement,  and will be made when that value is ascertained without waiting for the Treasury scheme.   this formula will apply irrespective of what the claimant is ...actually charged.3. If the case goes to arbitration no payment willbe made - the question of costs being left to the arbitratoror arbiter.h. Under the Acts,  if the ascertained development value does not exceed certain de minimis limits,  the case is excluded automatically from eligibility against the 300 millions.    In such, cases no payment will bo made.5. Where a contribution is payable in accordancewith the foregoing conditions, an additional payment may bemade at the Board&apos;s discretion in respect of professionalfees incurred on legal work as distinct from valuation workif the legal aspects of the case are quite exceptionallycomplicated.  .
