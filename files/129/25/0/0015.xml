llS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET CjCOPY NO.J^_CP. (1+8) 756th March.. 1CABINETEUROPEAN ECONOMIC GO-operation memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Chancellor- of the exchequer the Foreign Secretory will be attending the meetingof the Committee of European Economic Co-operation which will begin in Paris on 15th March.      The purpose of the meeting is to start the work of forming the continuing organisation of the participating countries which is envisaged in the Paris Report andforms an integral part of the Marshall Plan.2. The attached report of the London Committee describes theproblem which faces Europe and proposes a course of action and machinery for making yf effective.     This is proposed as an instruction for our delegation to the Committee of european economic Co-operation.3. The Foreign Secretary must be in a position at Paris tostate definitely the Government&apos;s attitude to European economic co-operation.      We are the only country that can give a lead andpublic opinion here and in Europe and in the United States isawaiting this lead.      Upon the lead which we give will depend thepossibility of success of this whole enterprise of european recovery and the Marshall plan.k* We must emphasise the gravity of the situation whichconfronts us and the other Western European countries alike.The first step necessary to avoid economic catastrophe is the rapidenactment of the European Recovery Programme, but our problem goesmuch deeper than that.5. It is an open question whether the Western Europeaneconomy (with which we are closely interlinked) can, even with the help of the European Recovery Programme, recover to anything approaching the pre-war standard of living.      Taking the very favourable assumptions of the American statistics the participating countries (and their Colonies) will hove only got two-thirds of theway towards paying for their essential imports from the western hemisphere by the end of the Marshall Plan period.      Unless we and the European countries make a single-minded effort for thenext four years with the direct purpose.of balancing our accountswith the Western Hemisphere the Marshall Plan will fail in its &apos;purpose, and when it ends we shall be confronted with the somegrim problems as face us to-day.      In such circumstances it mustbe doubted whether Western Europe could survive in the sense inwhich we hove, known it in the past. &apos;   Either we should have tobecome permanent pensioners on the United States or we shouldsurvive in a state of continuous economic uncertainty and povertywith all the disintegrating political and social results thatwould follow.
.6. In this situation the only practical course which is opento us is to go to work with the European countries in order to try and work through our common difficulties. It is only by positive action by this country, in full association witli the Commonwealth,that we ourselves and Western Europe can be saved.7. It would, in theory, be possible for us to seek asolution to the problem of the Commonwealth and Empire by our own efforts and to turn our bocks on Europe.      But the resources of&apos; theCommonwealth are not sufficient to moke this a practical solutionof our problems within the time available.      Nor would we remainunaffected by the continuing economic crisis in Europe and its political results.      Apart from this we are committed,  as acondition of receiving Marshall Aid,  t..  co-operate with the other16 European nations.8. There is therefore no option for us.      We must linkourselves more closely with Western Europe.      It is however of theutmost importance that this closer linkage with Europe should notweaken our connection with the Commonwealth.      We should take thegreatest care to keep thorn informed of what we are doing and why we are doing it and to seek their positive support and help.     TheCommonwealth Governments arc being informed of the substance of theattached paper and wo propose that a further message should be sentto their Prime Ministers though they should not be asked at thisstage for any formal&apos; approval.9. We are anxious that our colleagues should realise thatthe decision to involve ourselves in an economic organisation withother Western European countries and to  play a loading role within it is a step of for reaching consequences.      In itself and immediately it does not mean any sudden or dramatic change to anew system of economy at the present time.      But it will in all probability lead by gradual steps to a profound change in ourpresent economic system.      We shall bo engaged in  planning a modified Western European economy, in close association with theother participating countries, with, the object  of making ourselves,during the period of Marshall Aid,  as far as possible independenteconomically of the United States.10. In economic terms, ana leaving on one side questions of security, we shall bring into being 0 potentially strong economicentity consisting of the countries of Western Europe and their overseas territories backed, we hope, by the members of theCommonwealth.11. The process will be a gradual one.      But once it has begun it will not be easy to draw back,  and any retreat will becomeprogressively more difficult.      It is therefore essential that weshould take the initial step in full realisation of all thepossible consequences.      Economically,  we shall hove to make our plans in association -with others.      We shall not always be able todo as we would wish in our own interest.      We shall be bound totake account of the collective interest of the other participating countries.      Changes of a radical nature in our industrial and agricultural structure may become necessary to secure theeconomic independence of the Western European countries .os awhole and to use our collective resources to the best advantage.It is not possible to foresee whet those changes will be, but clearly the conception of a planned- European economy to takethe place of the several un-co-ordinatod economies which existto-day must entail many important changes both for u-s and forthe other participating notions.      It is only by changes in andre-integration of our economies that wo can have our economicfreedom.
12. These closer economic links will involve closerpolitical arid social ties with the other participating countries.This carries other risks.      We shall be associating ourselves withpartners.in Western Europe whose political condition is unstableand whose actions may be embarrassing to us.      We shall bemore intimately affected, by what happens in Prance or the low countries or Italy than we have been in the post.      This may in turn affect the Commonwealth,  and will require close and continuous consultation with them.      But we may hope that arising standard of life and prosperity in Europe may create anincreased, demand for Commonwealth products.13. We shall of course have it in our power to moderate theprocess and to steer it with this in mind.      Our influence inthe European Organisation will bo very great and should be decisive on major issues.1h* There is another important factor.      The continuing organisation will of necessity have to work in close association with the United States Government, who will accredit a specialEmbassy to it.      Its success will depend as much on the continuedflow of United States aid as on the efforts of its members toself-help.      While the main objective which we have outlined iscertainly in harmony with United States views,  the achievement of it may involve economic action which in concrete cases may giverise to opposition in the United States and lead to seriousfriction during the period of the European Recovery Programme.15* It remains to be seen whether our action,  in conjunctionwith other   European notions, can give the necessary lead,  andraise In the hearts and minds  of the peoples of Europe thatconfidence which will restore their vigour and faith.      This isthe motive behind our proposals for the Continuing Organisation,and we intend to pledge ourselves to do all in our power tosee that this Organisation succeeds.      We are sure, living hereas we ore among the potential dangers which threaten us,  that this action is necessary for our security and our survival.We therefore recommend:-that the Cabinet endorse the recommendations of theattached paper and authorise the Foreign Secretary togive a strong load to the Committee of European economic co-operation on those lines.that a message be sent to the Commonwealth Governmentsinforming them of and explaining the Cabinet decisions and^asking .t-hGir support.16.(i)(ii)E.B.6th March, 191+8
/CONFIDENTIALEUROPEAN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION(LONDON COMMITTEE)THE CONTINUING organisation* There will &quot;be a meeting of the Committee of european economic Co-operation in the middle of March, at which a working party of the 16 participating countries will be set up toconsider the functions and constitution of the continuing organisation provided in the Paris Report.      Prom these discussions will emerge the shape of the continuing organisation,and thus the nature of the European economic co-operation whichwill take place in the period of the EuropeanMrecovery programme.Purpose of Continuing Organisation2. In our view, it is desirable that the purpose of the continuing organisation should be formulated precisely.      if it isgiven vague terms of reference (e.g. &quot;to foster European economic co-operation&quot;) it will never set to work at all, and it willspend its time discussing the various countries&apos; hobby-horses(French proposals for customs unions, Belgian proposals fortransferability,  Italian proposals for increased trade in freshfruit,  etc.).      It must hove a cl*ear objective,3* The central problem of the participating countries,singly and collectively, is the trade deficit with the western hemisphere.      According to the United States calculations, onlyone-third of the participating countries&apos;  imports from the western hemisphere in 19kQ-k10 will be paid for by exports;    in 1951-52,even on very favourable assumptions, these countries&apos; exports tothe Western Hemisphere will cover less than two^-thirds of theimports they require.      This means that on present plans,  at theend of the four years of the European recovery programme, the participating countries (singly and collectively and taking theirdependent territories&apos; dollar earnings into account)&apos; will notnearly be in balance with the Western Hemisphere.      This wouldmean that either a further Marshall Aid programme would berequired or the countries would face an acute stondard-of-living and employment crisis.4. Clearly we cannot contemplate being in such a positionourselves;    nor can we tolerate that Western Europe generallyshould be in such a plight.      This would be failure of the attemptto rebuild Europe.      Moreover, the signs of this impendingfailure would appear long before the four years were out, and congress might well decide to write the whole Plan off, and wouldstop throwing good money after bad.3E   For the purposes of this paper Europe means the 16participating countries and their dependencies.-1-
5* In our view,  therefore,  it is necessary that the mainactivity of the continuing organisation must he to right the participating countries&apos; deficit with the Western Hemisphere,  thatthe various countries&apos; national action should concentrate on this,-and that, European co-operation should he specifically directed to this purpose. .    This could he expreSsed:-&quot;The purpose of the continuing organisation shall he to ensure the success of the European recovery programme,and in particular to ensure that by the end of theEuropean recovery programme period, the participating countries will become independent of extraordinary outsideeconomic assistance.&quot;,.    The last phrase is a quotation from the draft european co-operation Bill.      It provides the most acceptable definition of the purpose of the continuing organisation from the Americanpoint of view.Functions of Continuing Organisation6. The functions of the continuing organisation could best be defined in relation to the purpose, giving wide authorityto initiate and carry out co-operative action for this purpose.Our general idea is that the problem should be attacked in two ways:-(i)    by building up production in Europe (and Colonies) toreplace imports from the Western Hemisphere, and by building up exports to the Western Hemisphere:    thiswould be examined commodity by commodity, by governments in association with the industries concerned.(ii)    by taking general measures,  eg.  to reduce trade barriers in Europe and to develop improved paymentsarrangements within Europe,  consistent with the. main objective.7.    -   -      The continuing organisation should thus be empowered toexamine and foster all forms of co-operative action designed toreduce the participating countries&apos; deficit with the dollar area.It would proceed step by step and commodity by commodity,concentrating first upon the measures which could provide thegreatest economic benefit,  and upon which agreement could be readily secured.      The organisation would of course hove to work by securing agreement between the countries concerned on specificproblems;    there could be no question of instructions being givenby the organisation to the individual members.8.     - The method of operation would vary widely from cose tocase.      The governmental, industrial and social structures of theWestern European countries are diverse and cannot be fitted into one pattern of co-operation.      It would therefore be necessary todevelop a wide range of techniques of co-operation,  each suited to the particular problem to be solved.      Under the auspices ofthe continuing organisation, a network of inter-governmentalagreements (often associated with inter-industrial agreements)would take shape, all directed to the main purpose.9. Participation in European co-operation on these lines would require the United Kingdom (and other European countries)to make adjustments in economic structure which will createdifficulty.      But we cannot avoid the need to make such adjustments.      If we seek to right our position by our own efforts
alone, changes in our industrial .and agricultural structurewill &quot;be inevitable - either deliberate or imposed by the forceof events;    our present pattern of production, consumption andtrade will require considerable modification to eliminate the dollar deficit.      If on the other hand we embarked upon a far-reaching automatic policy of European co-operation (such as a customs union, developing towards complete economic union), greatchanges would likewise be required;    free imports from europe would have radical effects upon all our industry and agriculturesThere is no reason.to suppose that the changes which would flow from the type of co-operation outlined in the paper would be greater and more difficult than in either of these alternatives,and there is some reason to think they would be less.10. The fact does remain, however, that this line of approach deliberately limits our freedom of action in theeconomic field;    it will involve making commitments to other participating countries;    it is likely to involve some changesin our economy which will create serious problems.      But it is submitted that we really have no choice;    by accepting marshall aid, we commit ourselves to European economic co-operation, andthe scheme proposed at least seeks to    secure that this connection-operation will be constructive in character and will becarried out in a controlled manner.      Moreover,  this concentrationupon specific dollar-saving and dollar-earning co-operationpresents the least possible difficulties with the sterlingDominions, who are now co-operating with us towards the sameobjective.11. There are certain specific functions of the continuing organisation to which we attach importance, and on which it is submitted that our Delegation should be given preciseinstructions:-(i)    Allocation.      It is certain that the effect of theEuropean recovery programme will be to widen the scopeof allocation of scarce commodities.      This is atendency which we cannot resist.      We should, however,seek to develop the existing international machineryfor allocation rather than set up new allocationmachinery under the continuing organisation.      Inparticular, we should retain the present system of world-wide allocation of certain foods, nitrogen andseeds by Pood and Agriculture Organisation Committees,and if necessary accept this machinery to cover otherfoods and feedingstuffs;    timber, coal arid pitpropsshould continue to be allocated through the EconomicGommission for Europe;    in other cases,  it may benecessary to establish world-wide machinery for some,and work through the continuing organisation for others.      New subjects for allocation should betreated on the merits of the commodity,  and we shouldresist all proposals for a major change in existingallocation machinery.(ii)   Colonial Development.      There would &quot;be advantage insetting up, within the framework of the continuing organisation, machinery for co-operation on questionsof Colonial development between those of the participating countries who are Colonial powers.Such machinery would not be in any sense exclusive -i.e. direct contacts and consultations between one ormore of the Colonial powers, such as have been takingplace since the end of the war, would not be precludedand would, in fact, certainly need to continue and to
&quot;be extended.      But the establishment of formalmachinery under the auspices of the continuing organisation should serve to ensure that the majoraim of that organisation -namely dollar-saving and dollar-earning is kept fully in mind in plans for colonial development;    and it would not give the appearance,as might the establishment of formal machinery outsidethe framework of the continuing organisation,  ofexclusive arrangements between the Colonial powers.It is specially important that we should avoid any impression that we are ignoring the Dominions.      Weshould therefore make it clear that we shall continueour normal practice of close consultation with them on matters affecting Colonial areas adjacent to thera,  andthat we shall have careful regard to their views onany specific projects.(iii)    Customs Union Study Group.      The continuing organisation should exercise such supervision over the Customs UnionStudy Group as may be consistent with differences of membership.(iv)    The Continuing Organisation should be empowered toconsider the measures which should be taken (consistentboth with the main principle indicated in paragraph 5above and with the International Trade Organisationand the International Monetary Fund) to free the channels of intra-European trade, to expand its volume,and to facilitate intra-European payments.Form of Continuing Organisation12. In order that the work should be effective,  it isnecessary that the continuing organisation should &quot;be controlled bystrong national delegations representing governments.      Thematters with which it will be dealing will be of primary importance, and will certainly involve difficult decisions forthe participating countries.      The only way to make this at allpossible is for the- delegations to be strong,  carrying theconfidence of the governments..13. It is very important that the effective control should&quot;me in the hands of the national delegations,  and that these shouldbe strong enough to exercise this control and to prevent the secretariat (or an &quot;independent&quot; chairman) from taking action onits own.      These intimate problems of economic co-operationinvolve to a greater or less extent a limitation upon the nations&apos;freedom of action in matters of decisive political and economic importance.      This can be done only by representatives of governments,  and serious damage can be done by tactless inter-vention by &quot;international&quot; officials.      For the same reason, we propose that the continuing organisation should elect its ownchairman from time to time.1ii. Membership should be open to all countries which are willing to participate in a joint European recovery programme(subject of course to certain obvious exceptions).      Germany shouldbe fully associated with the continuing organisation,  and shouldhave the responsibilities and rights of a full member.Preliminary arrangements for this are being worked out by theUnited States, France and ourselves at the Tripartite talks nowin progress.
15* It will be necessary for the United States Administrationt e be closely associated with the work: of the continuing organisation, but we feel that the United States of America shouldnot be a member.      The continuing organisation should be a european undertaking, and it should be in a  position if necessaryto present a collective view to the United States Administration.We should not seek &quot;friendly aid&quot; from the Americans for theworking party meetings.16. The continuing organisation will have to work with otherinter-governmental bodies,  and in particular with the Economic.Commission for Europe,  and the Food end Agricultural, international trade and International Labour Organisotions^ etc.      This maypresent considerable difficulties in practice, for in some casesthe wider United Nations organisations are moro appropriate (on grounds of membership) while in others the wider United Nationsorganisations are already dealing badly with (and without theessential purpose of the continuing organisation)  subjects inwhich the continuing organisation would, have to act with vigour.The continuing&apos;organisation will not wish to supersede these other inter-governmental bodies, and reasonable working arrangements will no doubt be possible in practice.      But there is bound to be some difference of obi active until the United Notionsorganisations accept (and work on) the.basic importance of restoring the economic balance between United States of Americaand the rest of the world.17. The problem of the Economic Commission for Europe will be particularly troublesome.      We propose,  however, that in view ofthe importance of maintaining United Notions organisations and ofmaintaining economic collaboration in certain fields with theEastern European countries, we should continue to support theCommission even though this may involve great difficulties of demarcation.      In particular,  the Commission should continue withits present functions on coal,  timber and inland transport.      Atime may come at which the Commission becomes an arena for conflict between participants in the European recovery programme andopponents of it, but in the meantime we should support it, whilewatching to ensure that it does not obstruct or duplicate theworking of the continuing organisation of the programme.18. An important question at the Paris Conference was thelimitation of the existence of the continuing organisation to theperiod of the programme.      This was necessary to obtain the supportof the Scandinavians and Swiss.      While formally and for tacticalreasons it may be- necessary for us to leave this question open, weshould proceed on the assumption that,  in fact, the continuing organisation will develop permanent functi ans.19* We propose that the seat of the continuing organisation should be in one of the smaller capitals, e.g. Brussels.      TheFrench would not agree to its being in London, and we should not agree to its being in&apos; Paris.20. The fifteen points in the Annex have been suggested as agenda for the working party by Benelux.      These seemacceptable,  subject to the various additions and qualificationsset out in this paper.21. It will be necessary for the working party to frame 0draft multilateral agreement between the participating countries,as envisaged in the United States Administrations Bill, forembodiment in the bilateral agreements with the United states administration.      A further submission will be made to ministers on this.
Conclusions22. -   The London Committee asks authority for Ministers to instruct our delegation to the working party t ; proceed on theselines, and in particular on the following points:-(i)    Purpose of the continuing organisation (paragraph 5)and general function to carry out this purpose(paragraph 6).(ii)    Working of continuing organisation by agreement ofmembers concerned (paragraph 7).(iii)    Functions in allocation,  colonial development,  customs union study group,  intra-Europecn trade (paragraph 11)(iv)    Control by strong notional delegations and not by&quot;executive&quot; secretariat (paragraphs 12,  13)&apos;(v)    Membership open to all European countries;    effectiveparticipation of Germany (paragraph 1l).(vi)    United States of America not to be o member(paragraph 15).(vii)    Need for close co-operotion with other inter-governmental bodies (paragraph 16).(viii)    Continued support for the Econ miic Commission for europe (paragraph 17).Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.2nd March,  19U8.
