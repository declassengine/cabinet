(48) 723RD MARCH, 1948CABINETTHE THREAT TO WESTERH CIVILISATIONMemorandum, by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe fast increasing threat to western civilisationwhich Soviet expansion represents impels me once again to examinethe extent to which the Soviet Government appear- to be achievingtheir aims, together with the steps we should now take in orderto frustrate thorn.2. As my colleagues will recall,  I circulated fourX^apers to the Cabinet at the beginning of January (CP. (48) 5 -Policy in Germany;   CP. (48) 6 - The First Aim in british foreign Policy;    CP.(48) 7 - A Review of Soviet Policy;CP.(48)  8 - Future of Foreign Publicity Policy).3&apos; It will be remembered (as sot out in the Annex andin CP. (48) 7)  that over since the European Recovery programme was devised, the Soviet Government have been carrying on awar of nerves and behind it resolutely using the Communistparty to achieve dictatorship.    It is their intention to endeavourto expand their activities to cover the whole of Europe atthe earliest possible date.    So far as we are concerned, wehave been proceeding on the basis, which we made quite clear toStalin, that just as the Russians had built up in the eastwhat they called security, we intended to develop a good-neighbourly policy in the west, not aimed against Russia butinspired by the sheer necessity of economic revival and develop-ment and of security.    I made all this clear in my speech on22nd January.    But, as we foresaw,  events have since movedquickly and aggressively, most recently in Czechoslovakia and now in Finland, and I am convinced that we have to go wider than the original friendly intent of our more limited approach to the Benelux countries, with France, on the basis of theDunkirk Treaty.    It has really become a matter of the defenceof western civilisation, or everyone will be swamped by thisSoviet method of infiltration.    I ask my colleagues, therefore,to give further consideration &quot;to   the whole situation and decide
whether our policy should not now be broadened so that we canproceed urgently with the active organisation of all thosecountries who believe in parliamentary government and freeinstitutions, and devise methods which will cope with thisquickly moving stream of events.I have set out in the Annex headed &quot;Considerations&quot;in greater detail than in my earlier paper (C.xJ.(U8) 7)  the steps that have been taken by Soviet Russia from the days ofthe war-time conferences, until the present.There is only one conclusion to draw.    After all theefforts that have been made and the appeasement that wefollowed to try and get a real friendly settlement on a four-Power   basis, not only is the Soviet Government net prepared at the present stage to co-operate in any real sense withany non-Co:rimunist or non-Communist controlled Government, butit is actively preparing to extend its hold over tho remainingpart of continental Europe and,  subsequently, over the middle east and no doubt the bulk of the Far East as well.    In other words, physical control of the Eurasian- land mass and eventualcontrol of the whole World Island is what the Politburo isaiming at - no less a thing than that.    The immensity of the aim should not betray us into believing in its impracticability.Indeed, unless positive and vigorous steps are shortly takenby those other states who are in a position to take them,it maywell be that within the next few months or even weeks theSoviet Union will gain political and strategical advantages which will set the great Communist machine in action,  leadingeither to the establishment of a World Dictatorship or (more probably) to the collapse of organised society over greatstretches of the globe.1+. All our evidence indeed points to the probablestaging by the Soviet Government of further efforts in thisdirection during the next few weeks or months.    We cannot besure where exactly this showdown will take place nor even thatit will not occur in several places at once.   All we know forcertain (since the Oominform has proclaimed it openly) is thatits object will be the frustration by one means or another ofthe European Recovery Programme and the consequent developmentof a situation in which the Communist cause will triumph inmany countries largely as a result of a process of economicdecay.    But this does not mean that the Soviet Government are determined to have their way whatever the outside world may sayor do.    There is no reason even now to suppose that it could possibly welcome the World War which would undoubtedly result from its overstepping the mark.    It is commonly acceptedCommunist doctrine that no issue should be    forced until themoment is ripe and victory almost certain.    If, therefore, theupholders of true democracy and opponents of dictatorship   can-present a really united front, and if the necessary economicmeans are made available by those who have the;:,  the dangerof war is,  in my opinion, not imminent.    Indeed it is myconsidered view that the only danger of war arises from thenon-fulfilment of these two conditions.    Provided they are fulfilled I believe that Communism will be forced on to the defensive and that for many years at any rate we may look forward to a period of relative calm.5. On these two ;;ifs&apos;&apos;&apos;, however,  everything depends.As for the second, one we can only do our best to assist thepassage of the European Recovery Programme through Congressby continuing to warn the Administration of the dangers of delay.
The first &quot;if&quot; depends very largely on ourselves.    If we here,as a nation,  are united on the main issue, then additionalstrength to resist vail he imparted to our friends on thecontinent and,  indeed,  to our friends all over the world.If, on the contrary, we show evidence of irresolution anddivided counsels, there will he a corresponding lack of the will to resist which nay hove terrible results even if aid should eventually he forthcoming under the European recovery programme.6. Recent events have only brought to a head a fundamentalcontradiction which has been inherent in European politicsat least since the formation of the Third International.    It isthe contradiction between an imposed solution of socialdifficulties, which in the last analysis can only meanDictatorship, and a voluntary, reasoned and human solution which is summed up in all that we mean by the word ;&apos;Dcmocracy:&apos;.7. With a view to stemming any further infiltration ofdictatorship,  I make the following recommendations to mycolleagues:-Re commendations(1)   We should pursue on as broad a basis as possiblein co-operation.with our French allies, the conclusion of atreaty or treaties with the Benelux countries.    We should aimas a matter of great urgency at negotiating multilateraleconomic, cultural and defensive pacts between the UnitedKingdom, France and the Benelux countries, which would be left open for accession by other European democracies.    (This willbe done on the basis of the Cabinet decision approving therecommendations in my earlier paper (c.?.(h8) 6).)(2)    Simultaneously with this, the whole problem of theco-ordination of efforts for the cultural, social, economicand financial revival and development of the West and forthe defence of western civilisation with the support of allfriendly western Powers and of course of the commonwealth should be&apos;proceeded with at once.    Having in mind Soviettactics from Yalta onwards, we should decide what commonarrangements can be made and what consultations should be entered into to prevent Soviet tactics succeeding on on evenwider basis than hitherto and to halt any further expansion of soviet dictatorship.   The issue upon which we should consult with like-minded countries is not so much that of communismas of the establishment of dictatorship as against parliamentary government and liberty.    In this connection we cannot limitourselves to Europe.    We must bring in the Commonwealth and the americas, and eventually every country outside the Soviet group.(3)    This would include at an early stage Italy, whichis at present the weakest link in the chain of ant-i-Communiststates, but which     if we are to get a really effective western union - must be brought in.    But whether steps should be takenin advance of the April elections,  or afterwards,,  is a matter tobe determined.    In the meantime we should do everything in our power to assist the parliamentary government of Italy.(if.)    If my colleagues agree to this as a policy, then Iwould ask to be authorised tc proceed to discussions with theCommonwealth and,  through the diplomatic channels and in everyway open to me, with other countries sharing our western
soconception of democracy and liberty in order to build up theorganisation necessary to givo effect to such a policy.    Inthese discussions it would be essential to decide what isrequired of each western country collectively and individually.This would affect, among other things, defence, the budgetaryposition, the supply of food and the building up of oureconomies on an entirely new basis.   The division between us at theircment is so deep because Communism is playing sucha part in the west,  interfering with its economic revivaland making consolidation so difficult.E.B.Foreign Office, S.V/.1.,3rd March, 1948.
ANNEXCONSIDERATIONSI*    The Soviet refusal to co-operate with the WestAt the beginning of January I circulated to ray colleaguesa Review of Soviet Policy (CP. (1+8) 7)  summing up the generalsituation following the breakdown of the Council of foreign ministers and arriving at certain conclusions regarding soviet policy.      That paper showed how the soviet Government;   convincedthat the world was divided into two hostile groups of Powers,and determined to organise and to consolidate their own group as rapidly as possible, had disregarded their Treaty obligations andhad entrenched themselves in a most ruthless fashion throughouteastern Europe and in the Soviet Zone of Germany.      It was alsoshown how the Russians were determined to see to it that theEuropean Recovery Programme did not succeed and were in process ofv/elding the countries under their influence into a single political,economic and military bloc organised and controlled solely in their interest.      As will have been apparent from that paper,  all our efforts to arrive at an understanding with the Soviet Government,especially in regard to Germany, have proved unavailing.In the countries of eastern Europe where we hadagreements jointly with the Russians to regulate the post-war situation, we tried very hard to co-operate with them.      However,all our efforts were rebuffed and in every case our influencewas excluded.      In fact anyone in those countries who associates inany way with us is now liable to be accused of plotting against thesecurity of the State and may be tried on a trumped up charge andsentenced with droconian severity.      The acme methods are nowbeing applied in Czechoslovakia with the object of rooting out allwestern influence.I would also draw attention to CP. (1+8) 5 in which Idescribed the impossibility up to dote of reaching any agreementwith the Russians regarding Germany,  as well as the consequencesflowing from the breakdown of the Conference of Foreign Ministers.From these earlier reviews of the situation,  theconclusion was drawn that the Soviet Government,  in their attemptto wreck the European Recovery Programme and to consolidate their position in the expectation of conflict with the so-colledimperialist powers, would continue their efforts ta extend soviet and Communist influence wherever this could be achieved.      It wasalso made clear that a further Soviet advance at any point on theperiphery of the Soviet bloc in western Europe, in Italy, Greece,Turkey, Persia, China (including Manchuria)  and Korea, would gravely endanger our interests and relationships.     particular attention is drawn to the conclusion (CP. (1+8) 7, Conclusion (i))that &quot;if the Soviet Union secure control of France and French north africa, of Italy and of Greece, and particularly if they couldundermine our position in the Middle East, they would effectivelydominate the Mediterranean and could (if they so wished) deprive us of access to extensive markets of raw materials,  especially oil,without which our economic recovery would be difficult or impossibleand the strategic position both of ourselves and of the UnitedStates gravely jeopardised&quot;.
In assessing all the- factors beyond those referredto above, which lead rae to the conclusion that the SovietGovernment were not prepared to co-operate with the west,  Iwould draw attention to ray efforts from September.  1946, toDecember,  1947, to negotiate satisfactory peace treatiescovering Italy, Rounjsnio, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland.      As isknown, during the first half of this period at any rate theSoviet Government,  having tabled their&apos;demands, refusedabsolutely to make the slightest concession of any kind infavour of any view held by their three colleagues.     Thus,they demanded that the Italian town of Trieste should be handed over to the Yugoslavs and that a boundary betweenYugoslavia and Italy should be fixed which not only put theItalians strategically at the mercy of their neighbours, but alsoleft hundreds of thousands of Italians in Yugoslavia andvirtually no Yuglslavs in Italy.      They likewise demanded large sums in reparation from Italy ignoring the plea of their colleagues that if this were done it would simply mean that thewestern allies were themselves paying Italian reparations toRussia.     Not content with this,  they claimed an excessivelylarge share of the Italian Fleet and were in favour of theItalian armed forces being reduced to a minimum.      On most ofthe economic articles to which their western allies, who hadafter all suffered together with the Soviet Union from Italianaggression,  placed some importance, they adopted an entirelynon-co-operative attitude.      Finally they originally claimedsome say in the administration of Tripoli which they thoughtmight be useful as a Soviet base &quot;for their merchant shipping&quot;;and,  though they did not put this forward officially, wereunderstood to be hankering after some Soviet naval base in the islands of the Dodecanese.      As regards the Balkans, their chiefconcern seemed to be to prevent the.western allies from recoveringany real compensation for damage inflicted on their interests in roumania,  and to regaining any say in the administration of the danube.      They further objected violently to any clause in thetreaty obliging the ex-enemy Balkan states to accord any &quot;human rights&quot; to their populations and minorities.      They also objectedstrongly to the imposition of any effective machinery wherebyex-enemy States would be obliged to carry out the obligations to which they have subscribed.      As regards Bulgaria,  they didtheir best to protect the interests of Bulgaria and to deny to greece the most elementary claims against the country v/hich above all others had been responsible for stabbing her in the back.Finally,  they demanded what was,  in the view of the western alliesat any rate,  quite unjustified sums in the way of reparation fromall the countries c*oncernud, including Finland.It was only after a prolonged &quot;war&quot; of attrition thatthey yielded sufficiently for any treaties to be signed at all.Even then the Treaties embodied very substantial concessions tothe Soviet point of view, involving the creation against the better judgment of the western allies of a Free State of Triestewhich, it was clear from the moment of the signature of the treaties,  the Yugoslav Government, backed by the SovietGovernment, was determined by one means or another to bringunder Yugoslav control.      Subsequent to the signature of the treaties it became also clear that the few points v/hich,  as theresult of&apos;interminable argument during the Conference at Parishad been won from the Soviet Union,  such as the insertion ofthe Human&apos; Rights clause in the Balkan Treaties, were being simply-ignored by the countries concerned.      In other words,  except inso far as the major and more indefensible Soviet claims on italy were successfully resisted, the net result of our effort toco-operate with the Soviet Union in treaty-making has simplyresulted, as they always Intended,  in the total elimination of
western&apos; influence behind the -iron curtain.      Now even thetreaty with Finland, which involved the establishment of a russian base within 10 miles of the Finnish -capital, is apparently not enough.      A new treaty with Finland has been proposed, which would place that country even more firmlywithin the Soviet grip.Nor should it be forgotten that quite apart from theSoviet Government1s control of satellite states on theirborders,  comprising on 1939 figures, without Finland, overL+25,000 sq. miles and over 81+ million people, and beyond, theyhave already,  as a result  of the war,  added to the actualterritory and population of the Soviet Union in Europe in1939 figures:- -Area (sq. m.)

5411.      The Soviet Refusal to nn-npRr-ate in theUnited NationsFurther evidence of th^ failure of co-operation is provided by our experiences in the United Nations.     Fromthe outset of its work the United Nations has been handicappedand often stultified by the attitude of the- Soviet Union.The most conspicuous examples of Soviet obstruction have ofcourse arisen in the Security Council, and have centred round the use of the&apos; veto.     The veto was already the main point of dispute between the Great Powers in the original process of drawing up the Charter and founding the United Nations.     Itis worth making a brief examination of the history of this dispute.The principal problems in connection v/ith theproposed establishment of the United Nations were firstdiscussed in thorough fashion at Dumbarton Oaks in the autumn of 19hh.     Before this a preliminary comparison between theviews of His Majestyfs Government and those of the SovietGovernment on the organisation to be set up had revealed an encouraging similarity as regards basic principles, broadaims, membership and structure.      In the course of discussions at Dumbarton Oaks and after, however, it soon became apparent that the voting procedure in the Security Council wasthreatening to become a major bone of contention.     TheRussian&apos;thesis .was that no decision of the Security Councilof any nature could be  taken except with the unanimousconsent of all Permanent Members.      The United StatesGovernment and His Majesty&apos;s Government on the   other handargued that if any member cf the Security Council, whethera Permanent Member or not, was a. party to a dispute (i.e.directly engaged in a dispute which threatened the maintenanceef international peace and security or directly involved ina threat of a breach of the peace) it should not be entitledto vote at any stage of the consideration of the dispute bythe Security Council.     There v/as no disagreement thereforeon the&apos; principle of unanimity between the Permanent Membersbut only on the application of this principle in certaincircumstances.     Eventually,  as is well known, a formula,proposed by the British and United States Governments, which went some way to meet the Soviet view, v/as agreed upon atYalta,  and is now incorporated in the Charter underArticle 27 (3).There is no denying that the Soviet Governmentworked hard and made valuable contributions to theestablishment cf the United Nations, but from the verybeginning and more particularly in regard to the veto theyinsisted that the United   Rations could never   be used againstSoviet interests.     Already at San Francisco in April,  19h5M. Molotov, when pledging support for the organisation, had given a clear warning that while the Soviet Union wanted itto succeed,  she had other strings to her bow and was quite prepared to turn to other methods for retaining and spreadingher influence in the world if the United Nations did not fulfilSoviet expectations.The veto may be said to be used only when theprivileged vote of a Permanent Member of the&apos;Security Councilprevents the adoption of a proposal which has the support ofat least seven of its eleven Members.     In this sense, betv/eenJanuary, 19u7 when the Security Council began its work andto-day,- the veto has been used twenty-two times by the Soviet
Union,  twice by France, never by Chine, the United states or the United Kingdom,     It-wes originally contemplated - bythe- United States end Britain at all events,  though theSoviet Union never explicitly accepted this thesis - thatthe veto would be used only to protect the vital interestsof a Great Power.     But none of the twenty-two occasions on which Russia has used her vet:- can be said to conform to   this requirement.     She has imposed  the veto merely toget her way, or to prevent others getting theirs,  often onrelatively trivial issues and with no regard for the general opinion of the Security Council.      Thus in the Syria andLebanon case (February, 19Z46) and the Spanish case (June,19h7) Russia vetoed action by the Council which was    in no way opposed to her interests and indeed mot   many of herrequirements, but did not go far enough to satisfy her.She has used the veto in utter disregard of the evidence ena matter of fact (Albanian case,  ?,:orch,  19*47).      3h&apos;. hasused it to prevent the Council from handling as a proceduralquestion a matter which most of  its Members regarded as such(Spanish case, June,  19*4-7;    Gree&apos;: case,  September, 19*4 7).She has used it ten times  to prevent the entry into theorganisation as new Members of States she does not approve of,  and on one occasion at least,  expressly described heraction as based on considerations which, &quot;as the Charter makesclear,  are entirely irrelevant to the    issue.Nor .is it only Russian use of the veto which hascrippled effective work by the United Nations.     The threat of its use, or the knowledge that it certainly would be usedto prevent such action, has effectively prevented any movefor the revision of the Charter,  to say nothing of courseof any move for the expulsion of Russia or any of hersatellites from the Organisation,   though it might well beheld that some at least of these states had &quot;persistentlyviolated the principles contained in the Charter&quot;.It is true that the Russians themselves have seldomexceeded the literal rights and powers given to them by the charter.      When the Charter was being drawn up,   they made it perfectly clear that their main if not their sole concernwas to protect their position by a veto.      The veto wasgiven them,  and they have used it.      They have used it  far more frequently and cynicclly than was expected;    and theyhave vigorously rejected all attempts to modify theprinciples governing its use, or to limit them by customor a. &quot;code of conduct&quot;,  except in so far as they have-acquiesced in the establishment of a. custom that abstentionby a Great Power in the Security Council does not constitute a veto.     Nor does this prevent  them from expressingindignation at the criticism to which their use of the  vetohas exposed them.      They clrim indeed to be only exercisingan undoubted right.In other respects there is still less justification for Soviet behaviour in the United Nations.      They havefrequently been guilty of pure obstruction;    of attempting toembitter disputes and to fish in troubled waters,  andundoubtedly their attitude and- thet of their satellites inthe United Nations has strengthened - though it is by nomeans exclusively responsible for - the regrettable tendency of the Organisation to consider matters before it not ontheir merits but in the exclusive light of national policyand the coherence of blocs of states.     Even in social andeconomic questions the Russians have .seldom failed to act from
politiccl motives.      The seme&apos; must be or.id of the Sovietattitude  towards the Interne, tional Court of Justice.     Theyh-cve regularly end e evourod t   limit its sphere, to oppose the reference of any question to it end te reduce  the numberof questions which might be -referred to it for r. decisionor an caviarry opinion.The Soviet habit of discussing questions not ontheir individual merits out in relation&quot;to general politicalstrategy has led them te use the organs of the United Nationslargely for propaganda purposes.      This was very conspicuousat the second session of the General Assembly last autumn,notably in connee tion .wi th &quot;warmongering&quot; rend all colonialissues.      It has been -equally conspicuous in the Russianattitude to the Indonesian dispute before the  security council.     Russian prop&apos; eenda has led  to retaliation in kind,  and questions have seldom been handled by the united nations in the impartial,  expert,  and practical manner thatwas hoped for when it was established.     Such examinationdepends on the readiness of Delegations, not necessarily to compromise, but at least te make  a genuine exploration ofopposing views and to spare no effort  to reconcile them.Such an attitude has never been forthcoming frem SovietDelegations to the United Nations.      An example of effectiveUnited Nations work,  of the kind which was hoped for whenthe organisation was founded, has boon given to some extent by the Trusteeship Council.      It is impossible  to doubt thatwe owe  this example to the fact that the Trusteeship council has been boycotted by the Russian3.This form of boycott,  which goes back t e I9I46, was extended at the Second Session of the General Assembly, inI9I4.7, when the Russians declined  te  take part in the work ofthree bodies established by the Assembly against Russianopposition - the present United Nations Committee in the balkans,  the Korean Committee and the Interim Committee.These are the first examples of refusal by a.Member teparticipate in the general work of the Organisation,  eventhough such work may have been undertaken in opposition toan individual member&apos;s views.      It may rise be mentioned thatwhen the Persian question was before the Security Councilin the spring of 19*4 6,  the Russians&quot; when they found  the casegoing against them, first walked out and having returned ata later stage refused  to take any part in the discussion.In the Economic and Social Council and itsCommissions, where  the Russians have 0.0 veto powers theyhave shown under the appearance of    co-operation a tendency towards obstruction whenever the opportunity to air theiranti-Western propaganda occurs.      There, have been occasionalexceptions to this,  as for example the omission to use,  atthe Fifth Session of the Council,  some promising openings forattacks, on the Truman doctrine and &quot;dollar imperialism&quot;generally. -   In the main,  however, it has been the Russianpractice to pursue the same obstructive tactics at eachprocedural opportunity,  however irrelevant.     For instance,they persist in regarding as a political issue the questionof displaced persons whcT they assert are only deterred fromreturning to  their countries es &quot;because  they . are^ criminals ortraitors.     Here the Russians and their satellites claim thatthe resettlement of refugees amounts to nothing less than the exploitation of slave labour by the imperialist powers.To  take a further instance,  the Russians have taken
every opportunity to accuse the colonial powers ofexploitation.      In the Second General Assembly they were responsible for the deletion of the Colonial ApplicationClause in the Conventions on Traffic in Women and Children;and although the United Kingdom Delegate made it clear thatthe Conventions had already been applied to our non-self-governing territories,   the Russians chose deliberately tomisunderstand the restraint self-imposed by our constitutional practice in order to suggest to the world that the UnitedKingdom was  trying to hide a scandalous state of affairs.In the Minorities Sub-Commission at the Council&apos;s SixthSession,  the Russians tried to develop their familiar attacks on Colonial powers;    while in the Human Rights Commissiontheir influence has been steadily brought  to bear againstthe conclusion of c Convention on Human Rights.It is noteworthy that, in the current session atLake Success of the Economic end Social Council,  a strongly-worded counter-attack by the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryto the Foreign Office  to Russian charges about low living standards in the Colonies has tempered their usualextravagant behaviour,  end was directly responsible for asuggestion,   put privately by the Russian, delegate to  theParliamentary Under-Secretary,  that a debate should be avoided altogether on the &quot;Forced Labour&quot; item tabled bythe American Federation of Labour.As regards  the Military Staff Committee,   the atomic Energy Commission and Disarmament Commission,  it isfair to say that the lac; of progress made is due to thedetermined insistence of the Soviet Union on their minorityviews. .   There have at times been instances of deliberateobstruction,  e. g.  the Military Staff Committee was unableto begin any consideration of the General Principles whichshould underlie the Article ij-3 Agreements for several monthsowing to the fact that the Soviet Government die not furnishtheir representatives with instructions.Whilst the right of .the Soviet Government tomaintain strong views on  the potentially fundamental issuesat stake cannot bo gainsaid,   there have been regrettably fewsigns of any desire on their pr rt to take account of the opposite and majority point of view.      So far, for instance,as the Atomic Energy Commission is concerned,   the SovietGovernment do not merely insist  that a Convention providingfor the prohibition of atomic weapons and the destruction of stocks must enter into force before on agreement for inspection and control is negotiated, but they ere entirelyaverse from the conception of any International /gencywhich could be held to possess some over-riding authority incertain directions over national activities.      This of coursefits in with their basic conception of the unimpairedexercise of notional sovereignty as expressed in the united nations by the Greet Powers&apos; right of veto in the security council.      It is. this which makes any real approach to  unitythrough compromise In any of the above bodies impossible.Finally,   the Soviet Government have shewn a markedtendency to base  their approach to the problems of disarmament(including the atomic weapon) and security on  the consideration
how far they con be used for&apos; propaganda -purposes.      Thereis for instance little doubt that their original raising ofthe disarmament &quot;problem during the Second Fart of the first session of the Assembly in October,  i9i46, was done with this aim and in order to embarrass and immobilise the other powers.      Having, presumably, extracted for the time beingwhet they consider the maximum propaganda&apos; and nuisancevalue from their line, their delegates at New York are now taking a frankly cynical line as to the possibility of anyof the three bodies making further progress.Fundamentally,  as suggested above,  it it  the-Russian attitude  towards sovereignty,  recently expressed inan ever cruder and more reactionary way, which underliesthe ever more conspicuous  failure of all attempts to co-operate with  them in the United Nations.     The Organisation,it is true,  is defined as &quot;based on the principle of the sovereign equality of ell its members&quot;.     But sovereignequality does not imply equal end absolute sovereignty forall;    it implies merely that none need surrender moresovereignty then any other.      It is the Russian refusal to surrender to  the Uni ted Nr. tions any sovereignty at allwhich has so far prevented it from functioning and developing as most of its founders hoped.The plain truth is that the Soviet conception of real and genuine international co-operation is z collectionof governments which are either Communist or under communist influence.      For such time as free democratic governmentsexist real international co-operation is in their viewimpossible.      Thus,  in spite of the assurances they may fromtime to time be given for political warfare purposes byStalin,  their Communist logic compels then; to trie belief  tactno international organisation in the political sphere canpossibly work satisfactorily from their point of view until such time  as all nations are Communist or under strongCommunist influence.-1 2-
IIT.      Our Response_r_Y/c stern ; union for our part, while doing our best  to preserve PourPower Unity we have throughout sought to strengthen the tiesbetween the United Kingdom and the different countries in western Europe.      Thanks to our stand in 19I4.O British prestigeon the Continent at the end of the war was immense,  ana we hadnaturally formed connections  of a very close and friendly kindWith the Governments in exile here.      The land,  sea and airforces of our western allies which had been formed in thiscountry went home with a high opinion of the excellence ofBritish equipment and methods of  training.      All this good willhas been built up,  except in those countries where the Russiansput a full stop to the process, and we have given unfailingsympathy and support to our friends in  their efforts toreconstruct their countries.      with France, Belgium end Hollandin particular it can be truly said that never in our historyhove relations been better.With. Italy a determined effort has been made terestore really friendly relations ana to show  :*ur readiness to make a fresh start.      .&apos;/c cannot meet Italian wishes to thefull in regard to the disposal of their former colonies, but inall other fields we have done a great  leal to hvlp the emergence of a neW and democratic Italy from the wreckage  of fascism.All possible help has been given to the Italian economy,  and on political questions we have throughout been Very forthcoming.Assailed on the one side by the Communists and their allies^the Nenni Socialists,  and on the  other by the forces of reaction,the Italian Government has had a very difficult task.      But it hasstoutly maintained the principles of democracy,  and in so for as the issue turns on its desires, we need not doubt Italianco-operation in the rebuilding of 3 sound Europe.In all  this we were very careful to avoid anything that might tend to divide the world into opposing blues.      TheTreaty of Dunkirk with France;,  the- only alliance into which we entered during the whole period up to my recent speech in the House of Commons, was directed solely against a revival of German militarism,  and the Soviet Governmentwore kept informed of our intentions throughout and raised noobjection.      The   only other treaty which we considered entering into in Europe during this same period,  the so-called Byrn.es(Four Power) Treaty,  and which foundered on Russian  opposition,was also concerned solely with Germany.      This  pro-occupationwith Russian reactions did not  neet with the response for whichwe had hoped.      On the contrary,  although our policy was aimeddeliberately at strengthening good relations with the western european countries individually, we wore confronted by anunscrupulous campaign of misrepresentation by the Russians  onthe ground that wo were promoting a &quot;western bloc&quot; at the verytime when they wore themselves strengthening their grip in eastern Europe by fraud and violence.      Our explanations fell ondeaf ears.      Everywhere the Communists sought to trouble relationswith this country^Whatever the merits of this admittedly cautious policymay hove been,  the fact remains that the ceaseless blows of soviet Russia and the evident determination of the Communists^toprevent the recovery of western Europe,  in so for as it lies intheir power to do so, have made a more forward policy necessary.In my paper, CP. (U8) 6,  I expressed the belief that we should seek to form, with the backing of the Americas and the Dominions,
a western democratic system comprising,  if possible, Franco,the Low Countries, Italy, Scandinavia, Portugal and greece and I added that as soon as circumstances permitted wo should of course wish to include Spain and Germany also.      explained that our treaty relations with the various countries might differ, but between all there would be on understandingbacked by power, money and resolution and.hound togetherby common ideals.      When the idee woo ventilated in my speech in the Foreign Affairs debate   ,n 22nd January lest thisconception of a &quot;spiritual&quot; union of the west met with c very favourable reception abroad,  except of course in Communistcircles, ana the work of translating it into effect has madea promising start.On the economic side- for instance the team of theEuropean Recovery Programme experts from France and thiscountry who have been visiting the different capitals have found so wide a measure of agreement that I and M. Bidaulthave been able tj convene a mooting of the- full Committee ofEuropean Economic Co-operation in Paris on 15th March.      Ishall myself be attending this meeting, which should bo- ashort one, and I have proposed that the agenda shall include   .the establishment of a. &quot;working Party which will meet at once and whose duty will be to draw up a plan for a continuing organisation, to be set up a-s soon as the European recovery programme legislation has. boon passed by the- United StatesCongress,, and to do other preparatory work.      The work ofthis Continuing Organisation is bound to have an important effect on the integration  of the economies of the participating countries.      Meanwhile work has been proceeding not only through the various technical committees set up by the firstParis Conference, but also through the Economic Commission for europe.      Of particular importance is the Customs Union study group,- and there have also been meetings on Inland Transport,Electric power, Coal, Food and Agriculture,  Steel, andMan-power.      A Trade Union Conference has been called by theTrades Union Congress for .. th March, which will give the unionsof the countries participating in the European Recovery Programmean opportunity of demonstrating their solidarity in support .-fthe Plan and the importance which they attach to its success.Arrangements have also been made by the Labour Party for ameeting on 21st and 22nd March of the Socialist Parties fromparticipating countries.As against this progress it is true that the methodby which the French Government has been obliged to devalue the franc was undoubtedly a setback,  end that we are having greatdifficulty in reaching a financial agreement with the BelgianGovernment.      However, talks are proceeding on the possibilityof a clearing between this country, Franco and the benelux countries.On the political side there have been preliminaryexchanges of views on the plan for a treaty,  or treaties,between the five countries.      My general conception waswelcomed with enthusiasm,  and the Benelux countries have,very rightly,  as I think,  laid great emphasis on the need for closer economic co-operation between us.      The BelgianGovernment in particular has pointed out the anomalies of a situation where the United Kingdom follows a  policy ofausterity,  Belgium a policy of free trade and Prance apolicy not easy to define.      The Benelux Governments are alsoanxious that treaty arrangements shall not take a  purelynegative line in regard to Germany.      They wish it made clearthat the five Governments desire to incline Germany towards the-ih-
west and arc ready, with due safeguards,  to co-operate in herreconstruction and they have suggested that the most suitablearrangement would bo a poet of general application.      Finally,they have left us in no doubt that military clauses must intheir view for.: on integral part of the treaty arrangements,and that they expect staff talks to follow on its conclusion.For our part we regard it oo very important that the treaty or Treaties should contain provisions against o revival ofGerman militarism,   and the French agree with us on this.      Butwe hove no reason to doubt that the different points of viewcon be reconciled,  and the problem is to be examined byofficial representatives  of the five countries who are to meet at Brussels on 4th March.      As soon as they have broken theground we hope there will bo a meeting of Foreign Ministers toagree on broad principles and t    lay down instructions for the drafting of a suitable Agreement.      It certainly seems as ifrecent events would hove hod the effect  of reinforcing thearguments of those who hold that some instrument on the linesof the Dunkirk Treaty would be insufficient to meet, presentneeds.Meanwhile tripartite talks on the future of Germanyhave begun between the Americans,  the French and ourselves,and, by agreement the Benelux Governments have been associatedwith the study of all questions except those concerned,, purelywith the administrative problems  of the three Zones.      In our desire not to close the door on a  possible Four Power Agreementwe hove delayed those talks dangerously long and it io not to beexpected that we shall roach any final conclusions oven nowduring this first-meeting.      But all parties t..  thcuo talks admitnot only the need for reviving the  economy of weotern Germany butalso the potential danger which a strong Germany would represent,and it is manifestly essential to western Europe that o preomentshall be reached in the early future regarding the methods bywhich a balance shall be struck.
IV.        TUe Immediate OutlookNow that a coup d&apos;etat has been successfullystager] in Czechoslovakia,   and that measures arc- in processof being taken to bring Finland and Hungary more directly under the control of Moscow,  the next step for the Russiansmay well be in the direction of Italy anci/or France,  withpossibly a threat to the independence of the otherScandinavian countries, and increased aid to the GreekCommunists in their rebellion.Up till recently it was thought that the Communistsmight be laying plans Tor direct action in Italy our in.   themonth of March.     But certain indications now lead us tobelieve that they may be waiting for the elections in April.In France the situation has become  less favourable  to the communists since the relative failure of the strike movementwhich was launched last November.     In Italy the Communistshave been joined by ITenni who has decided the&apos;:  the Socialistsshould fight the elections on a common ticket with the communists.      These tactics are likely *;o lead  to  the eventualelimination of the Socialist party in Italy.      The Lombards indSeragat sections of the Socialist party have broken away,  butthey ere unfortunately unlikely to carry many votes with them.The Communist-Nenni Socialist coalition stand a fair chanceof securing as much as I4O per cent, of the votes,  end if  theyemerge as the strongest single group they will have c claimto form the new government&apos; and a plausible  pretext for makingtrouble if this claim is ignored.      ghoul;  they be able to force   themselves into power,  even as members of e  coalition government,  the usual methods would be followed.     It is  truethat the present Italian Government ere fully alive  to   the dangers of such a course,  but if th-.   elections go well forthe Communists the letter will be in e better position thanthey are now to apply pressure. .    It seems unlikely  tint  theywill risk these possibilities -of   ction by following a violent course in the meantime which they fear eight cause the Italian Government to postpone  the elections or even leadto American intervention.      Whether the Government can maintain Its position before  the elections and subsequentlywin them depends mainly on the aegree of encouragement endsupport which they feel they can count on from ours- Iveo  end the Americans.      In genera I it seems likely that the Communistswill postpone direct action in France until they hi vc forceda decision in Italy,  or until they secure some other directroad of access between France  end the Soviet orbit.As regards Scandinavia,  the action of the russians in forcing a treaty on the Finns may perlu ;s In&apos;   ta en as evidence of their pre-occupation with the consolidation oftheir security in that pert of Europe.     They may well feelthat once  the situation in Finland has been fully assured,the time    is rine for further progress.      Sweden is at presenthoverina between her obvious affinities with toe West and hertraditional policy of neutrality, and the Russians may feelthat it is necessary to make .a determined effort no v. toprevent the Swedish Government from leaning more towards thewestern Union.      Cn the other hand, opinion in Norway hashardened considerably against the Communists,  especially since the events in czechoslovakia.In South-Eastern Europe,   the consolidation of
Communist hegemony within the Soviet orbit has been completed by the practical elimin-r tion of  the moderate elements in the hungarian Social Demo ore t Party.      Although Morkos h:s notyet achieved all that the Soviet hoped 0/ &quot;him,  and althoughboth Tito and Diraitrov have been called to order in respectof their ideas of Balkan federation and the formation of aYugoslav-Bulgaria Customs Union,  these checks may hove boondue  to the impression caused in Moscow by  the s trongreaction of the Americans to recent events in presee and by government statements in  tola country,  including  those madein the Foreign Affairs debate in January.      If the ourmioeexpressed above  with regard  to France  end Italy io correct,the timing of events in South Eastern Europe is likely tcbe brought into step with their plans for the west.    &quot; the pressure on Greece is being maintained end may well beincreased.      The 80vie t snub -co Bimitrov on &apos; the relativeslowing-down in the Balloons may well only to tactical movesconnected with the imminence of  the Italian elections.As regards German;/,  ouch indication;- as we have still point to the preparation of large-scale strikes in theWestern Zones for the month of March,  one  there is no sign-that this has been postponed.      In  the Soviet Zone.- however,it seems either  thet  the Hussions hod no cut one eiriodprogramme as we suspected  they Mao before  toe breakdown ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers,  or to, t they have Por some reason hesitated  to put it into operation.In the Middle Mast,   there are ot present no definite indiortiono of an immediate Russian ooove in thedirection of the Persian Gulf.      But the Persian Governmenthave been clearly warned   that they must  take  the consequence 0of rejecting the arrangements which the Russians have pressed for in connection with oil concessions.      The SovietGovernment have thus prepared the way for renewed pressureat any time.      I  would recall in this connection that Sovietpressure on Persia since  the war began with Soviet failure to withdraw their troops in accordance with their treaty obligations and the stirring up of trouble    in th:, oil fields.This was halted when we sent troops ana ships to the persian gulf and the america decided to sup-port Persia.In Palestine - the Soviet Government are profitingfrom the present uncertainties.      Toe numerous illegal jewish immigrants include Soviet agents,  and we may confidentlyexpect the Soviet Government to exploit the situation withthe purely opportunist 1 im of increasing confusion to  themaximurn possible e0:tent.Soviet and Communist policy in the For East is developing,  though not perhaps at the same rapid  tempo as inEurope.      In China,   the Communists are gaining strength at theexpense of the National Government end  the latter are losingprestige in consequence.      Whether this process can be arrested depends almost entirely on the amount of Americanaid which the Government receives in the near future.In Northern Korea, the Communists are engaged in drafting the constitution of a &quot;People1s Republic&quot;, which itis expected will be proclaimed some time in March,   and which mayclaim jurisdiction over Southern Korea, as well.      11 seemsvery probable that simultaneously with the proclamation,   the.Russiens-may announce the complete withdrawal of their forces from their Zone,  in order to oblige  the-Americans by the pressure of local opinion to withdraw their forces from the
south.      It is difficult to see how the United StatesGovernment could retain their troops in ouch circumstances.Once  this withdrawal has been .effected,   tin. Russians would of course have the whole country at their mercy.     A &quot;people&apos;scrmy&quot; exists in the north, backed by Soviet forces ccross the border,  rnd it would be easy for them to stage c putsch inthe south.      But  this racy not be necessary since- it can thenbe only a matter of time before the whole of Korec comesunder the jurisdiction of the People&apos;s Republic, whatever theresult of the elections which are to be held in the southunder the auspices or&apos;  the United Nations.It must be emphasised that  the foregoing paragraphscontain a very  tentative estimate of Soviet intentions inthe immediate future.      v/lieu they reach the point cf being put into action,  Soviet plans mature very quickly and theyare moreover very flexible.     It is no toricusly rash toforetell what the Soviet Government may do at any givenmoment.
