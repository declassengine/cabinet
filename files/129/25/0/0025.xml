Man-powers further fall in January in the number of women employed in indusrty was more than offset by an increase in the number of men.2. Employment in manufacturing industries, which declined by 12,000 inDecember, rose by 21,000 in January.3. Total man-power engaged in building and civil engineering declined inJanuary from 1-36 to 1-34 million (Table 2).Under-manned industries4. Most of the under-manned industries secured more workers in January.The number of coal miners on colliery books rose from 718,000 to 721,000 inJanuary and increased further to 722,900 at 6th March. All main divisions of the textile industries recorded increased employment in January (Table 3).Unemployment5. The number of insured workers registered as unemployed in Great Britaindeclined slightly from 318,300 at 12th January to 315,400 at 16th February.Foreign workers6. By the end of 1947, 98,225 foreign workers had been placed in employmentin Great Britain under official schemes. A further 7,341 were placed in January.7. In addition, permits were issued Outside the official schemes in 1947 to employ 22,965 foreign workers.   (18,952 permits were for domestic workers.)II. Production8. The index of total industrial production (1946=100) recovered from115 in December to 121 in January. This was almost 14 per cent, above the volumeof production in January 1947. For manufacturing industries as a whole theindex was 123 in January (Table 1).35066 this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s government      u &quot;
Coal9. Output of deep-mined coal averaged 4 million tons a week in the firstfortnight of March and opencast production also increased to 248,000 tonsin the second week of March. Total output of coal for the first ten weeks of1948 was 41-3 million tons which is 998,000 tons or 2-5 per cent, above the target for this period (Table 4).Production of deep-mined coal	1948 Th. tons	1947 Th. tons	Percentage changeJanuary  Weekly average	3,963	3,580	+ 10-7February         --1st week 2nd week 3rd week 4th week	3,878 3,989 3,924 3,891	3,408 3,651 3,831 3,652	+ 13-8 4- 8-7 + 2-4 -4- 6-5March  1st week 2nd week   ...      ... -	4,031 3,981	3,503 3,661	+ 15-1 -j- 8-7Steel10. The output of steel ingots and castings rose further in February to289,000 tons a week. This is 7 - 3 per cent, above the weekly average target rate for1948   (Table 5). .    .11. Production of pig-iron rose again to 176,000 tons a week in February.Stocks of scrap were maintained in February at 352,000 tons, but stocks of pig-irondeclined further from 402,000 to 386,000 tons.Cotton Spinning12. Output of cotton yarn rose further in the last week of February to15-65 million lb. The output of yarn (including cotton waste yarn) at the end ofFebruary was nearly 17 - 3 million lb. which compares with the weekly target rateof 17-31 million lb. for the year 1948 and with the rate of 19-23 million lb. to bereached at the end of the year   (Table 5). JkIII. Transport13.   During January 1948, 743,000 loaded railway wagons were forwardweek compared with 730,000 in January 1947.   The increase was mainly &amp;the rise iu coal traffic but in recent weeks there has also heen more mr*vk*traffic on the railways   (Tables 6 and 7).IY.-Food14.   In 1947, consumption of potatoes, bread and fish was higher *the war; consumption of meat, bacon, fats and shell eggs was- Towerliquid milk were 52 per cent, higher than in 1939.

Payments16. The drain on reserves was low in the last week of February so thatthe total drain for the month was  43 million as compared Avith  57*4 million in January and  48 million in December. In the first week of March, the drain,at  11 million, was no &quot;lower than the average for February (Table 9).17. Seasonal rmyments for United States cotton in the early part of theyear are now completed. On the other hand, purchases of Canadian food havebeen heavy In recent weeks. Much of this is wheat, still bought at $1-50 perbushel. Belgium took a further amount of gold, over  1 million, in the first week of March. The new Agreement, about to be signed, provides that goldpassing as from 1st March will be repurchasable. The quarterly instalment inrepayment of the Canadian interest-free loan, due in February, will be made inMarch; this will add about  9 million to the drain on reserves in the month.18. The last drawing from the United States credit was made at thebeginning of March and the South African loan of  80 million was added tothe gold reserves in February. The only replenishment of our reserves of gold and dollars, which we can now count on, is the regular but small purchase ofnew gold from the Sterling Area (outside South Africa). There remain thepossibilities of additional releases from the Canadian credit and of furtherdrawings on International Monetary Fund. The last of the drawings from theCanadian credit, which had been agreed for the first quarter, have now been made.No arrangements have yet been agreed with the Canadians for further releasesafter the end of March from the outstanding balance of about  60 million. TheUnited Kingdom has drawn  60 million from the International Monetary Fundsince September 1947 and the ma.xim.uvi additional drawings which could be made between now and next September to complete our quota are about  20 million.We have in the last few days applied to the Fund for a drawing of  15 million and are awaiting the Fund&apos;s decision.Total net drain on reserves^)  millionFirst half      .................. 467July    ..................... j33August......      ...      ...... 156September     .................. 93October         ...      ...      ...... 67November      .................. 59December      ...      ...      ......      ... 485948-January        .................. 57 February       .................. 43(&apos;) Including drawings on United States and Canadian credits andthe International Monetary Fund.35066 b 2:
VII-Bilateral Negotiations19. Since my last report, negotiations with Iceland have been concluded :negotiations with &quot;Brazil, Belgium, Turkey, S.C.A.P. (Japan) and Mexico are con-tinuing. Those with the Russian Zone of Germany have been adjourned forfurther examination by both sides of difficulties arising out of the talks. the yugoslav negotiations for a long-term agreement have failed as the UnitedKingdom could not agree to Yugoslavia^ demands for assured deliveries of capital goods against her maize supplies : negotiations will shortly be resumed for a short-term agreement without the capital goods and the maize.20. The principal features of the new agreement with Iceland are that weshall receive in 1948 increased quantities of herring meal for animal feeding andof herring oil and the desired quantities of frozen fish for the 1948-49 winter.United Kingdom will supply 50,000 tons of coal, 2,500 tons of steel and 120 tonsof sisal.21. As regards Belgium, very difficult financial negotiations have just been concluded. Under the new arrangements third country transfers have beenreduced to  1 million in each of the three six-monthly periods ending 30th June,1949, and imports into the sterling area from Belgium may be reduced or postponedimmediately. These two provisions should reduce the outflow of gold. The agree-ment also permits us to repurchase all gold (except certain specific payments) sold to Belgium after 29th February, 1948, as soon as the balance of payments turns inour favour and the total volume of Belgian exports to the United Kingdom has reached  49 million. An Anglo-Belgian Joint Committee will be established towork out the details of the trade arrangements and to keep the whole agreement under review, and will begin operations this week.YIII. Prices and FinanceWholesale Prices22. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices rose again in february to 214 (1938 = 100) compared with 209 in January and 201 in December. The risein February was due mainly to higher prices for eggs, bacon and hams and forwool (Table 10).Import and Eaport Prices23. The index of export prices was unchanged in January at 244 (1938 ^100), but import prices rose from 263 in December to 269.Prices of Imports Total   ............Food, drink and tobaccoRaw materials ......Articles   wholly   or   mainlymanufactured    ......Prices of Exports  ,Total   ............Food, drink and tobaccoRaw materials ......Articles   wholly   or   mainlymanufactured    ......24.

March wheat futures were quotedat $2-49 a busnel. n
IX,-Wage Rates26. During February, agreements were reached or awards given in twelveindustries involving wage increases and in two industries involving a reduction ofthe working week. The principal agreements reached were in the transport industry (railway and London transport).27. At the end of February there were thirty-eight claims outstanding,including eleven new claims submitted during the month. Of these new claims themost important are those for increases of 13*. and 15s. a week for men in theengineering and shipbuilding industries. If the claims for engineering are granted in full they will affect 1\ million workers and will cost about  50 million a year. Other claims outstanding relate to retail distributive workers employedby Co-operative societies and to workers in furniture manufacture.
