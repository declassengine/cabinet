Ci*v*s^w. /Ltfrtfk...........Copy No.30CABINETCYRENAICAMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. At their 83rd (46) Meeting on 26th September. 1946, the Cabinet, after con-sidering a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP.(46)354) on the policy tobe followed in regard to the future of Libya, agreed that a more progressive policy was required in the administration of Cyrenaica than that which the British military administration had been obliged and instructed to follow hitherto, and approved the establishment of a War Office Working Party to recommend what steps shouldbe taken to this end. As I reported in my Memorandum (CP.(47)126) of nth April,1947, the Working Party visited Cyrenaica in December, 1946, and January, 1947,and their recommendations (which were not referred to the Cabinet &quot;in detail) wereendorsed interdepartmentally in principle in April, 1947.2. At their 5th (48) Meeting on 19th January, 1948, the Cabinet approved theproposals which I made in my memorandum (CP.(48)4) dated 5th January, 1948,for evolving a completely new administrative structure and policy &quot;for Cyrenaica,and steps are being taken to establish a Libya Committee to consider the technicaldetails arising out of the implementation of these proposals.3. The purpose of this present paper is to report to my Colleagues the progress which has been made in the implementation of the Working Party&apos;s recommenda-tions. Before turning to the main recommendations it will be appropriate to alludebriefly to the position of the Emir and the attitude he has adopted.As the keystone of any indigenous edifice, the Working Party stressed the impor-tance of persuading the Emir (who had been in exile in Cairo since 1922) to returnto Cyrenaica and to take up permanent residence there. The Emir, however, made his return contingent on certain conditions which may be summarised as(a) conditions which would ensure his position and dignity as the accepted spiritunland temporal head of his people and,(6) conditions which would give him executive control in the government of theterritory.The former were reasonable enough, but the latter were unacceptable. Only inAugust, 1947, were his demands suitably modified, and, following the award of the k.B.E. and the honorific title of Emir, the provision of a Civil List and the settlementof his outstanding debts in Egypt, combined with the assurance that suitable accom-modation (Graziani&apos;s palace at Benghazi) was being prepared for him as a residenceand office, that certain changes had been made in the staff of the Military Administra-tion to meet his personal prejudices, and that a Cyrenaican Administrative council would be established, the Emir returned to Cyrenaica on 16th November, 1947, where he received an enthusiastic welcome.4. The following is a summary of the progress made in the implementation ofthe Working Party recommendations, which have been grouped under general headings.Details are at Annex &quot;A&quot;.(a) Closer Association of Cyrenaicans with the Administration.In all the measures taken to this end, the Military Administration has proceeded after discussion with the Emir and with his concurrence.(i) Association with the central Administration:With the Emir&apos;s wish for executive authority and control, theestablishment of a Cvrenaican Council as an integral part of theMilitary Administration has been a matter of lengthy negotiationregarding status, powers, size and composition.   On 16th December,Printed /or the Cabinet, February, 1948
1947. an &quot; Administrative Council &quot; was eventually instituted.Although out of deference to the Emir the Council is called adminis-trative the executive responsibility remains with the Military Adminis-tration. ,  . .      .     .      ,The headquarters of the Military Administration has beenreorganized into four departments, Interior, Legal. Finance, andDevelopment, each under a British Secretary with a Cyrenaicandeputy, who is a member of the Administrative Council. Three ofthe deputies have been appointed. The Council is, therefore, thetraining ground for a future Executive Council into which it can betransformed at the appropriate time.(ii) Association in local administration. The proclamation giving formal recognition to the municipalities of Benghazi, Barce and Derna, thethree principal townships in Cyrenaica, has been agreed with the Emirand now awaits promulgation.(iii) Association in the legal system. Three Cyrenaican Assistant Mutassarifsare being appointed as members of the standing Military Courts, whichhave jurisdiction in matters affecting Proclamation Law.Ahliya (Peoples&apos;) courts have been set up at four towns.(iv) Association of individuals and the training of others with a view to theirlater employment in the Administration.Owing to the dearth of locally qualified men for employment inthe higher administrative appointments and in technical posts, the emphasis (as recognised by the Working Party) must be for thepresent on training.Apart from the three deputy secretaries, mentioned above, sixCyrenaicans have been appointed to higher posts in the Adminstra-tion, and seventeen have been attached to Europeans for training inone of the aspects of administration.The present stage in the implementation of the Working Party&apos;srecommendations for the closer association of the Cyrenaicans withthe Administration is, therefore, almost complete. Details are atItems i-io of Annex &quot; A &quot;.(b) Reconstruction and Port Clearance.Rapid progress has been made in the restoration of wells and cisterns,a project which the Working Party stressed was of vital importance, in aland of scanty rainfall whose inhabitants are predominantly pastoralists, andmany nomadic. Repairs to electricity and water supplies in urban areas arealso proceeding at a satisfactory rate and steps have been taken to obtainsuch new plant as is required. Clearance and - demolition of bombedbuildings in Tobrak has been completed, and authority to grant necessaryloans to owners to rebuild their houses has been given to the Administration.Work is well advanced on the erection of the new township outside the oldtown which is to house some of the 15,000 former inhabitants evacuatedduring the war. This will prevent overcrowding the reconstructed oldtownship.The minor essential repairs to Benghazi Harbour recommended by theFleet Civil Engineer, who, as suggested by the Working Party, undertook a comprehensive survey 01 the port, have now been completed and theAdministration has been authorised to proceed with repair work on oneof the principal moles in the harbour, the preservation of which the FleetCivil Engineer stressed was vital if the harbour was not to be irreparablydamaged. Further approval has also been given to a repair and develop-ment scheme recommended by the F.C.E. on a considerably larger scale than envisaged in the Working Party Report, involving total expenditureof the order of  110,000.Work on the clearance of wrecks in the harbour at Benghazi and Tobrukis proceeding slowly: the poor weather conditions and the lack of skilled labour and materials are the limiting factors. No estimate can yet be givenfor the completion of this work.A survey of the harbour at Derna is being undertaken and no immediaterepair work is considered necessary at the present stage. Activity in theport has increased and facilities for the present traffic are adequate.After discussions on the political, economic and military aspects of theBenghazi-Barce-Solluck Railway it has now been decided that the railwayshould be re-opened.Details of the measures&apos; for reconstruction, port clearance and thedevelopment of communications are at Items 11-15 of Annex &quot; A &quot;.
(c) Development of Social Services.Most ot the Working Party&apos;s recommendations for the expansion of theeducation services in Cyrenaica have already been implemented.50 Egyptian teachers have been selected and have signed contracts andthey are posted to the territory as soon&apos; as accommodation has been prepared.36 teachers are now working in schools. The appointment of a LibyanAssistant Director of Education awaits the discovery of a suitable candidate.Approval for the establishment of a Trade School has now been granted and accommodation is being sought. The institution of school meals for children under seven has been welcomed by the inhabitants.Shortage of accommodation and staff and the time taken to completerepairs and renovations to existing buildings have somewhat delayed the implementation of the Working Party&apos;s recommendations for the further expansion of medical services but this has had no ill-effects for, asemphasised by the Working Party, the services at present provided are ofa comparatively high standard. The buildings required for training schoolsare, however, now complete, except for the walls which have to be erectedaround female quarters. The Emir himself has recently expressed surpriseand gratitude for the excellent medical services which have been provided forthe Cyrenaicans. The necessary equipment has been procured but has notyet been distributed. A school for nurses and midwives is due to open thismonth but recruits are not yet readily forthcoming. The Emir has promised to invoke the support of the women once the schools are open. The schools for dispensers and dressers are functioning but there is a shortage of teachingstaff.Details of the development of the social services are at Items 29-40 of annex &quot; A &quot;.(d) Trade and supplies.The supply of consumer goods has improved, in particular increases inthe tea and sugar rations have been possible and adequate quantities of low-priced textiles are now available, all items of prime importance to theCyrenaicans.Where possible, restrictions on trade have been eased, but the policyof non-discrimination under the Washington Loan Agreement has renderedit impossible to grant open general licences for imports.The Working Party were concerned lest the export trade in sheep (oneof the territory&apos;s main assets) should suffer through shipping difficulties.Events, however, have proved that the assistance of the military shippingauthorities was not required. The trade has increased and shipping has beenarranged mainly through commercial channels.The B.M.A have not yet been able to interest Cyrenaicans in the estab-lishment of small industries but efforts will continue and suitable personsencouraged by means of loans from the Administration.The loans have been approved in principle but as yet no demands forthem have been considered by the Administration.Details of trade and supply matters are at Items 23-26 of Annex &quot; A &quot;.(e) Development of agriculture, forestry and veterinary services.As recommended by the Working Party, expert advisers were des-patched to the territory to report on the various long-term aspects ofagricultural development.The Reports submitted by Sir Herbert Stewart, Mr. Maitland and Dr.Fowler have been closely considered in conjunction with the Working Party&apos;suggestions. This has entailed a certain amount of delay in drawing up thefinal proposals.However, the majority of their proposals have now received approval and it will be possible to put in hand these long-term development measures.Meanwhile, some immediate steps have already been taken, namely,the establishment of agricultural, horticultural, barley and hill farms,research stations, the development of demonstration gardens, and irrigationon the coastal plain, the settlement of 20 Cyrenaican farmers in the hillfarms and Barce Plain, and small scale afforestation at Barce and Derna.Details are at Items 16-22 of Annex &quot; A &quot;.if) Staffing.The recommendations of the Working Party have been adopted asextensively as possible. Mr. A. L. Kirkbride, late Chief Secretary, Aden,- has been seconded to the War Office and appointed as Chief Administrator.Where possible, Arabic-speaking officers are being recruited for otherofficer grade posts as vacancies arise. A new wage structure has been authorised for Cyrenaicans with improved salaries and revised gradings basedon the Trans-Jordan scales.Details are at Items 41-45 of Annex &quot; A &quot;.(29256) ^ 2
(g) Financial.As will be seen from the detailed comments above, nearly all of therecommendations have now been implemented. The additional expenditureactually approved amounts to about , 303,000.5. There is every evidence that the Emir and the Cyrenaicans are appreciativeof what has been done, and their good-will has been retained not only by the very substantial earnest of our intentions but also by the prospect of benefits to come.6. With regard to the future, the early movement of troops from Palestine toCyrenaica in considerable numbers is a complicating factor. Although the Cyrenaicanswill not be slow to appreciate the wealth brought into the territory in consequence, yettheir nationalistic aspirations will on the other hand make them quick to resent anyproprietary attitude. Moreover, careful co-ordination will be required to ensure that,in view of the very limited resources, the substantial requirements of the Services (inparticular the Army and Air Force) for accommodation, amenities, materials and labourdo not retard or hinder the programme of civil rehabilitation and development, theenergetic prosecution of which it is essential to continue.E.S.The War Office,2,6th February, 1948.ANNEX &quot; A &quot;details of progress of working party&apos;s recommendations for cyrenaicaRecommendations1.

recommendations the Emir to be offered the alternative of(a) An Advisory Council to form thegerm of an executive councilbased on selected members of theMejlis Tdari (Administrative Com-mittee) of the Jabha el Wataniya(National Front) with inclusion inthe Council of five ex-officiomembers.ifi) An Advisory Council of four to sixpersons nominated by the Emir,but independent of the Jabha elWataniya, which will remain a purely political association repre-senting Cyrenaican opinion.Discussions with the Emir indicated hispreference for alternative (b).9. Reorganization of central administration under four secretaries, Legal, Interior, Develop-ment and Finance, with appropriate depart-ments grouped under them.10. The Emir to be invited to take up hisresidence in Cyrenaica, but not to be pressedif his conditions for doing so are dependentupon assurances unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.11. A more progressive policy of publicworks to include [a) the rapid restoration ofwells and cisterns in grazing areas, repair of urban electricity and water supplies, rehabilitation-tation plan for Tobruk, (b) greater priority forengineering works programme, greater use of sub-contractors, larger works to be offered fortender abroad.12. Measures to prevent further deterioration-tion of Benghazi Port.13. Revival of activity at Derna.14. Railway to be reopened experimentallyprovided that costs over those of care&quot; andmaintenance can be largely recovered.9. The re-organized Central Administfation underfour secretaries, Legal, Interior, Development and finance came into being on 1st January, 1048.10. The Emir returned to Benghazi on 2isi Novem-ber, 1947.   He is at present living at Leyte.Work on Graziani&apos;s Palace in Benghazi is progressingspeedily. This will, when ready, provide living andoffice accommodation for the Emir and his staff.11. (a) Restoration of wells and cisterns is two-thirds completed. In order to control stock movementscare has to be taken to plan which wells and cisternsshould first be restored.(b) Plant for improving urban water and electricity supplies is being obtained.(c) Work on Tobruk township progresses verysatisfactorily.((if) Clearance and demolition of bombed buildings in Tobruk is now completed.(e) The main drainage scheme has been completed.(/) The saline water supply is now working.

Minor essential works, advocated by the FleetCivil Engineer have been completed and approval hasbeen granted for work to begin on immediate repairson one of the principal moles up to the full recom-mendation of the Working Party. Work is at presentheld up owing to bad weather. A fuller scheme recom-mended by the F.C.E. over and above the working party&apos;s proposals and involving an overall expenditureof some  110,000 has now been approved.13. The present condition of the harbour is con-sidered suitable for the shallow draught vessels whichat present use it.14. After examination it was found that it would beuneconomical and almost impossible to carry out thisexperiment on a short term basis. Following discussions in the War Office and at G.H.Q., M.E.L.F., it has nowbeen decided, in view of the move of troops from palestine, that the railway is desirable for military aswell as for civil purposes and the necessary financialapproval for its full re-opening has been obtained.8. An Administrative Council under the presidency of the British Chief Secretary, established on 22ndDecember, 1947. Membership consists of four LibyanDeputy Secretaries, four British Secretaries, plus oneelected by the Chief Administrator and one by the Emir.
Recommendations15. Encouragement   to   road  transport companies.16. The establishment of agricultural,horticultural, barley and hill farms researchstations.17. A survey of water resources.18. A &quot; District Extension Scheme&quot; of short-term development covering demonstra-tion gardens, irrigation on the coastal plain,the importation of seeds and implements,recovery of neglected vineyards and similar measures.19. The progressive settlement of Arabfarmers on ex-Italian holdings on the BarcePlain and in the Jebel, with technical guidance and loan assistance on co-operative lines.20. Limited reafforestation pending a survey of requirements.21. The extension of veterinary services by repair of the hospital and the establishmentof clinics, quarantine stations and mobiledispensaries.22. A token provision for a livestockimprovement programme to be formulated.23. Steps to hasten delivery of allocatedtextiles.24. The issue of &quot; blanket&quot; licences forthe import of all goods from the sterling area(except certain scheduled commodities).25. The organization of the export of sheepin co-operation with the military shippingauthorities.26. The creation of a fund for makingloans to industry.27. The relief of the destitute and of wardistressed from the giants made to munici-municipalities.15. Efforts to obtain permission for the CyrenaicaBus Company to operate to Egypt started in December,1946, but with no success to date.16. The detailed proposals submitted by the Terri-tory have now been approved.17. Financial approval has been obtained for thecompletion of an immediate survey by an experiencedirrigation engineer.18. Mobile pumps have been purchased to assist theirrigation of the coastal gardens and the issue of seedson loan is being arranged. Extra attention is being given to this scheme in an effort to supply military needs for vegetables in the near future. A team of someeleven Cyrenaican gardeners and pruners are now operating on the Barce Plain areas, including vineyardsand orchards.19. The scheme is in operation and the first phasehas been completed. Twenty tenants were settled onthe Barce Plain during 1947 and are cultivatingtheir land satisfactorily. Work has commenced on afurther 53 houses for Arab settlement during 1948.A co-operative society has been formed and loans of E.10 per tenant has been made by the Society. Thecost of ploughing and seeding will be recovered in kindafter the next harvest. The Cyrenaicans have respondedwell to this project.20. Small scale afforestation has been started out-side Barce and Derna from funds provided in thecurrent year&apos;s Estimates. The Forest Officer hasinspected areas suggested by Mr. Maitland (ForestryExpert) and is preparing detailed plans. To-date15,000 trees have been planted in Barce and Derna(unfortunately 6,000 of the latter were washed awayby heavy floods).&apos; 21. Detailed proposals for the extension of theveterinary services have not yet been completed, dueto changes of staff in the Territory.22. Approval has been given to proposals based onthe report of the expert adviser called in by the Adminis-tration to examine the problem.23. Delay in delivery is due to the time taken to convert the allocation of yam into piece goods and cannot be reduced. However, only a small part of thetotal requirements is now supplied in the form ofallocations from the U.K. Quantities of cheap textileshave been purchased from Japan and the supply position in Cyrenaica is now satisfactory.24. Policy of non-discrimination under Art. 9 ofthe Washington Loan Agreement renders inadmissibleany open general licence for imports from the sterling area. Open general licences for imports from any othersource are also inadmissible because of the over-ridingnecessity for economy in foreign exchange.25. Exports during 1947 have far exceeded 1946figures. Though the B.M.A. hired an L.C.T. from theAdmiralty and assisted to a small extent in the shipment of sheep to Egypt, events have now proved that theassistance of the military shipping authorities is notrequired.26. No success has yet been attained in encouragingCyrenaicans in the establishment of local industries,but efforts continue. Approval in principle has beengiven for the Administration to make loans.27. This is being catered for under existing municipalarrangements. Destitute persons are adequately pro-vided for B.M.A. has given assistance in the form ofblankets and rations. In addition an Arab child welfare Committee has been formed under the presidency of an English lady.
Recommendations28. An early enquiry into the cost of living and basic wages.29. A scheme of teacher training.30. The temporary importation of teachersfrom Egypt and the Levant.31. The appointment of a Libyan as director of Education.32. The provision of scholarships tenableabroad.33. The establishment of a trade school.34. Certain expansion of existing schools,female education and boarding facilities.35. The temporary institution of school meals for pupils under seven.36. Endorsement of the proposed ex-expansion of medical services in 1947/48.37. The establishment of training schools for nurses, midwives, dispensers and dressers.38. The removal of Barce civil hospitalto more suitable premises and early com-pletion of other necessary repairs.39. The provision of two mobile dispen-saries and additional radiological equipment.40. The encouragementwelfare activities.of   voluntary41. The extension of existing secondmentsto B.M.A. where necessary.42. The offer of permanent or contractualemployment under the British Governmentto suitable officers now temporarily filling keyposts.43. Adoption of the system of secondmentto fill the balance of vacant posts.44. The introduction on a small scale of displaced Persons, subject to the consent ofthe Emir.28. An increase from 10 to 12 piastres a day has beenapproved for the lowest paid workers following an investigation into the cost of living.29. The Egyptian teachers college at Giza were unable to arrange for a two-year teacher training course in their curricula. It is, therefore, proposed to open a training school in Benghazi to cater for the 15 selectedCyrenaican trainees whom it is intended to send abroad.The arrival of four qualified Egyptian instructors has enabled a start to be made in this work.30. Thirty-six Egyptian teachers have now arrivedand are working in schools in Benghazi, Barce andDerna. The remainder who have signed contracts willbe moved to the Territory as accommodation is pre-pared.31. The appointment awaits the discovery of asuitable candidate.32. Owing to the political situation in Palestine ithas not been possible for the three Cyrenaicans to take up training in the Police School.33. This has been authorised and accommodation is being sought.34. First Year Secondary classes have been started in Benghazi and Derna.35. This scheme is being carried out with great success and is much appreciated by the Cyrenaicans.36. All proposals have been approved with theexception of the preparation of a small-pox hospitalon which further details are required from theAdministration.37. The buildings are now complete except for theerection of enclosing walls around the female quarters.Schools for nurses and midwives are due to open thismonth. Two British nurses have arrived and pupilsare being recruited. Schools for dispensers and dressersare functioning, but there is a shortage of staff.38. The new civil hospital, including the medical officers&apos; quarters have been completed and the hospitalis functioning in its new premises.39. One mobile dispensary is already operating in rural areas, and if it proves its usefulness a second willbe obtained.40. Two British Red Crescent Society workers arenow in the Territory. They are running a maternityclinic and child welfare centres. The scheme is financed by the society. Local communities take a great interestin this type of work, which will be expanded at a later date.41. This is being done where possible.42. It has been possible to put this into effect in onlyone case so far. There are ten other officers who wouldlike permanent or contractual employment under theBritish Government, but it is difficult for a GovernmentDepartment to consider them for permanent or semi-permanent posts when they will be unable to perform the duties of such appointments because they arerequired to remain in Cyrenaica. They have been invited to apply for Colonial Service appointments, andit is hoped that the Colonial Office may be able toconsider the offer of suitable appointments to them.43. Mr. A. L. Kirkbride, late Chief Secretary, Aden,has been seconded to the War Office and commissioned for the appointment of Chief Administrator, Cyrenaica.In addition three Colonial Cadets are now serving theAdministration. It is hoped to secure other qualifiedpermanent officials from Palestine.44. Seventeen Royalist Yugoslavs are- already employed. Other D.P&apos;s. in Egypt and Italy have to bescreened in Germany before they can be employed, andthey would present a serious problem should it benecessary to deport them subsequently.
Recommendations45. The application of Transjordan salariesto the new higher posts for Cyrenaican officials,and a general realignment with comparableTransjordan gradings.46. An additional expenditure of  124,500before 30th June, 1947, and the provision of afurther sum of  289,650 in 1947/48 for the implementation of our proposals.45-ProgressA new wage structure has been authorized for47. The recovery of  37,000 a year of theabove from repayment of loans and otherreceipts.48. An attempt to secure the Emir&apos;s co-operation in raising  70,000 a year newrevenue through the introduction of direct taxation by the imposition of a herd tax anda dwelling contribution.49. Increases in the fees for tradinglicences and in the duty on exported sponges,and the charge of a fee on the registration of firearms.50. The issue of new postage stamps tobring in  30,000.51. The substitution of a double budget,one British and one Arab, for the existing formof Estimates, as a step towards financialautonomy.52. Publication of a statement of policy.53. A Parliamentary statement givingassurances regarding the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government towards Cyrenaica.54. Speed in decision on the &quot;WorkingFarty&apos;s Report and in the implementation of approved recommendations.Cyrenaicans with improved salaries and revised gradingsbased on the Transjordan scales.46. (a) The proposals recommended by the working party were considered to entail expenditure up to 30thJune, 1948, of the order of  300,000. With the excep-tion of one or two minor items in respect of which further reports have been requested from the Adminis-tration, financial approval has been accorded to all theWorking Party recommendations, total expenditureagreed to-date being : Recurring Non-recurring 66,786  220,031(b) In addition, approval in principle has been givento the following expenditure : Recurring Non-recurring 3.100  13.460(c) The increased rates of pay approved for localstaff based on the Transjordan scales will also involveadditional expenditure up to  20,000.  &apos;47. Additional revenue is beginning to accrue asanticipated by the Working Party.48. The Emir informed the WTorking Party that hewas averse from the imposition of direct taxation untilthe future of the country has been settled. M.E.L.F.consider it is to our advantage to continue the indirect taxation at present imposed since it gives us a much better yield than can be expected from direct taxes for two or three years during which assessment lists arebeing effectively compiled. However, they propose totake up the question of an animal and dwelling tax withthe Administrative Council.49. Proposals to increase the trade licence fee andimpose a business profits tax which have been drawnup by the Administration are now being examined.Sponge licence fees and export duties have alreadybeen increased and legislation has been provided forfees to be charged for the registration of firearms.50. All details of the required design have been passed to the Crown Agents who are arranging the printing. A high priority for the printing has beenarranged.51. Following the Working Party&apos;s recommendations for a double budget framed for internal circulation only,a budget in Arabic is being prepared for local use whichwill achieve the purposes that the Working Party hadin mind.fit was agreed in London that no statement should be made on the lines suggested by the53- ^Working Party.(847/43)   93   s/48   W.O.P.   29256
