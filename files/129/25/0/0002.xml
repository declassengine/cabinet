B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,24th February, 1948.Note by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Report, I think, explains itself and I would make only three comments :  (1) The result of my enquiry has been to confirm the view whichthe Secretary of State has more than once expressed in public, thatthe majority of the Control Commission are patriotic and hard-working public servants who deserve every support in their most difficult job.(2) I have been given every assistance by General Robertson and his staff,high and low, who have facilitated my task at every point.(3) No responsibility attaches to anybody except myself for any statement or conclusion in the Report. General Robertson is. however, ingeneral agreement with it, while reserving the right to make any comments on points of detail when he has studied it more carefullyand not to commit himself at this stage regarding any particular rateof reduction in the Control Commission staff in the year 1949-50.P.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,February, 1948.34971b
REPORT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON THE FUNCTIONS,^ORGANISATION  AND   ESTABLISHMENT   OF   THE   control commission FOR GERMANYIntroductoryYou asked me on 15th October, 1947, to enquire into the functions,organisation and establishments of the Commission. My terms of reference were as follows :&apos;- (1) To investigate and review the various functions which are beingperformed by the British Element of the Control Commission for germany, distinguishing between those determined by quadripartitedecisions and those which are within the sole competence of His.   Majesty&apos;s Government.(2) To define as precisely as possible the functions which ought to be performed in future.(3) To consider the organisation best adapted, with all due regard to economy of man-power, to execute the functions defined under (2).Alike with regard to functions, organisation and personnel, my task fallsunder two heads: one, to describe what is, and two, to recommend what shouldbe with special reference to the year April 1948-April 1949.2. By various methods I have collected and arranged, and interpreted, agreat mass of material bearing on the first part of the task, the description ofwhat exists at the.moment. It is available, of course, when required, but in viewof the state of flux (referred to again in a moment), through which the wholeCommission is passing, much of this descriptive material will rapidly become ofhistorical interest only and I see no reason, therefore, to set it out in detail, exceptvery briefly in the appendices* to this report.3. With regard to the second part of my task, that concerned with recommendations for the future, the state of flux is still more obviously thegoverning factor. Clearly it is impossible to determine how the Control Corn-mission should be organised or how much staff it requires, until one has decidedwhat its functions in a given period (April 1948^-April 1949) are to be.4. The functions, however, which should be performed by the control commission are obviously the counterpart or supplement of those to be performed by the German authorities, and these latter functions, I need not remind you, are under the closest consideration at the moment.5. Moreover, whatever German agencies are developed or freshly establishedduring the coming year, it will be very hard, until it is seen how quickly theyare capable of standing safely on their own feet, to forecast at all precisely theBritish staff required to supervise or assist them, or supplement their activities in any way. Nevertheless, an attempt must clearly be made. What follows,therefore, is inevitably very broad and very provisional.6. Assuming that a new set of German institutions is functioning by theend of the summer, I would strongly recommend that a further report on theproper functions to be performed by the Control Commission should be called for and obtained by the end of the year.7. When those functions are more clearly defined it will be possible to speakmore confidently about the best way in which the Commission should be organised to perform them.8. One idea, I know, will be kept in the front of discussion to which it hasnot been possible to give complete effect hitherto. In so far as the main workof the Commission will lie in supervising a provisional German Government itwill be essential that the British or Anglo-American supervisors!)^ brought asclose as possible at every point to the German authorities with whose work thevare concerned. J* Not printed.
79. The Central German body will presumably be functioning at Frankfurtand I think it of the highest importance that the Allied leaders (i.e., GeneralSober tson and General Clay) should spend most of their time and be accessiblethere. I know it is very much in the Military Governors mind. The same principle will dictate to a considerable extent the actual organisation of theCommission into Divisions, Branches, &amp;c, though, of course, there will be someDivisions e.g., Intelligence to which there is no German counterpart.Functions of the Control Commission10. In constitutional theory, which has less and less application, relevanceor meaning, the British Element of the Control Commission is only one nationalelement of a single Commission, and the basic function of the whole commission is to see that the decisions of the four Commanders-in-Chief are carried out.In practice, the functions of the British Element include, at the lowest estimate,the achievement of the purposes of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Germany.11. We occupied Germany as 1 see it, for the reasons that can be placed under three main heads : (1) Security in the narrow physical sense against future German aggression.(2) The education of the German people in a peaceful, democratic, Christianoutlook, including the whole process of denazification and the estab-lishment of democratic institutions.(3) The liquidation of various situations arising from the war and its after-math, including reparations, rehabilitation of the German economy andthe recovery of expenditure on Germany since the war, the care of displaced persons, punishment of war criminals, disposal of surplusBritish stores, &amp;c.12. Once in Germany, however, we have acquired, whether we like it or not,a high measure of responsibility for everything that happens there. The aimsjust mentioned under the heads (1) to (3) involve in any case the reconstruction ofGermany economically and physically, as well as spiritually, and indeed so longas no German Government above Land level is permitted, our responsibility forthe good government of Germany can hardly be said to stop short of that sustained by any national government towards its own people.13. It is true that we have, over a wide area education, public health,police, &amp;c, delegated responsibility to the Germans during the last year, but this,though it has a most important bearing on the numbers of the Control Commissionstaff required, has not hitherto, I submit, affected our ultimate moral and politicalresponsibility for what goes on in Germany. It is my view of the essence of anysalutary change in the year ahead that we should disembarrass ourselves of a large part of the responsibility in question by tranferring to the Germans sufficientpowers, and sufficient power to enable them to feel, and the world to recognise, thatthey have in fact got a Government of their own. Until such a change is made wecan expect little if any progress towards a self-supporting Germany.Establishment of the Control Commission14. It is estimated that on 1st April, 1948, the manpower of the control commission engaged on functions essential to the control of Germany (&quot; withinthe ceiling&quot;) will amount to 15,733. This compares with 19,771 on 1st April,1947, and a peak of just under 24,000 on 1st January, 1947.15. There are in addition staffs &quot; outside the ceiling &quot;; that is to say supple-men tary staffs acting on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Germany, orengaged on non-control activities arising as an aftermath of the war. The costof these staffs is for the most part recoverable from other Departments. On1st April they are estimated to number 3,316, making a total staff in the Corn-mission of 19,049. (In April, 1947 the corresponding total was 24.432. The peakon 1st January, 1947, was 26,280. Early in 1946 a target of same 40,000 wasaimed at, but it was never attained.)34971 b 2
Methods of sub-dividing the establishment16 What will the 15,733 English men and women engaged on &quot;essentialcontrol functions &quot; be doing? There are various ways of sub-dividing the figure.The simplest way of conceiving the Control Commission is to think of it in terms otthree sets of staff; one, Regional, spreading downwards from the military governor through the Regional Commissioners and the District-group (Regie-rungsbezirke) Commanders, to the District (Kreis) Resident Officers; the second,functional, descending from the Military Governor through high co-ordinatingofficers to the heads of Divisions or independent branches, i.e., Industry, Finance,Legal, Public Safety, &amp;c, to the various junior members of divisional staffs; thethird set is best described as administrative, in the sense that they service not theGermans but the whole British staff of the Commission, the Allied Missions, press and other sponsored visitors in the Zone, and the families of all of them who arein the Zone.17. The picture is complicated by the fact that the first two hierarchies areintimately interwoven and that a large proportion of the members of the secondhierarchy, i.e:, the Divisional or Functional staffs, are serving in the Regionsunder the orders of the Regional Commissioners. They owe double allegiancein the same way as, in the army, engineers and doctors owe allegiance to both theCommander of their operational unit (e.g., a Divisional Commander) and, on technical matters, to the head of the R.A.M.C. and Royal Engineers. While, forexample, the Chief of Industry Division is an Officer on the Headquarters staffof the Military Governor, over 150 officers of the Division are in NorthRhine/Westphalia, serving under the Regional Commissioner.18. A simple method, therefore, of dividing the 15,733 British personnel would be to say that 896 were the Regional hierarchy; 1,788 were the functionalofficers serving on Regional staffs; 4,246 were functional officers acting directly under Headquarters instructions. In addition Intelligence Division accounts for 2,826 and the Interpreters&apos; Group for 350. Finally 5,627 were engaged inservicing British personnel.19. The above is the simplest way of splitting up that part of the control commission personnel who are within the manpower ceiling, according to theirpresent method of organisation. Analytically, however, if we approach thequestion from the angle of deciding what functions should be performed byBritish, and what to transfer to German, hands, a preferable division is asfollows : (1) Functions which could only be performed under British direction.(2) Functions where British staff co-operate with the German authorities,whether by way of control supervision, advice or assistance.(3) Servicing of British staff.According to this classification, the following Divisions come under the firsthead as essentially British functions : Disarmament; Reparations Deliveries and Restitution; Intelligence;Combined Services; parts of Posts and Telecommunications, Industry,Finance and Legal, Allied Liaison Branch and Missions, E.C.O.S.C. (Econo-mic Sub-Commission) Research Branch, Interpreters&apos; Group, headquarters staff and British Zone Petroleum Co-ordinating Authority, absorbing 4 566British staff in all., ,T^,t^s? ?nould be added the Regional hierarchy, the local representativesot the British in Germany, amounting to 896.  The heading therefore totals 5,462.20. Under the second heading come the remaining Divisional Staffsamounting to 4,644 m all:-Governmental Sub-Commission, Political AdviserDenazification, and German Zonal Advisory Council, Political Division Educa-tion Branch and Adviser, Religious Affairs, Public Health and Public SafetyBranches, Public Relations and Information Services Control, parts of LeealDivision, Economic Sub-Commission (excluding Research Branch), Industry(excluding Disarmament), Fuel and Power, Commerce, Food and AgricultureLTt^ w*  anCe (6X^ Udml ^P^&apos; Control) and Manpower Divisions, posts and Telegraphs group (less Services Section), Civil Aviation Branch and Zonalstatistical Organisation.
21. Under the third heading, the administrative staff concerned withservicing British personnel total 5,627.*Possibility of Waste of Manpower22. The question could, of course, be explored at length whether these numbers contain any elements of waste or in fact correspond to requirements.In view, however, of the changes and reductions which are about to be carried further, such a discussion would be largely academic in character.During the last three months I arranged, in conjunction with the military governor, that spot checks should be made on various key points of theCommission into the organisation methods, and staffing, in particular at the headquarters in Berlin of the Economic Sub-Commission, and FunctionalDivisions, and at the Branch Headquarters at Herford, where the Records Sectionof Intelligence Division was inspected. They were conducted by Mr. Briggs, theForeign Office (German Section) Adviser for organisation and methods, appointed in consultation with the Treasury (Organisation and Methods Division), andMr. Bovenizer, until recently the Director of Organisation of the Control Com-mission. They were carried out in relation to the functions which the various branches examined were seeking to perform, without reference to the broaderquestions of principle as to what are and are not the proper functions of theControl Commission. The results of these enquiries reveal, it is fair to say, a reasonably satisfactory state of affairs, though some changes in organisation and methods and economies in staff were recommended and will be made. In the short time available for these enquiries only a limited ground could be covered. Theyare being continued over a wider ground to provide more comprehensive and detailed recommendations. The programme of detailed survey that has been commenced will help to ensure that in work organisation, methods and staffing,maximum possible efficiency and economy is achieved.23. The limited field in which detailed investigation has been made on my behalfhas shown few signs of overstaffing. On the other hand, I have little doubt that theControl Commission is expensive in manpower judged by Whitehall standards and for very obvious reasons. I refer to (1) geographical dispersion, (2) frustra-tion by Russian policy of the original quadripartite conception upon which ourown administrative structure was based, and (3) uncertainty about the futurewhich has hitherto blocked all efforts at simplification and clarification. the geographical dispersion involved in separate Land Governments would in anycase have used up a good many British personnel, but the extravagance of man-power imposed by frustration and uncertainty can be briefly illustrated by pointing to the fact that we have not less than three central British organisations,actual or potential, at Berlin, Frankfurt and Lubbecke.Estimates for the Year 1948-4924. Nevertheless, when all is said, a certain global figure of personnel willbe necessary by the end of the financial year 1948-49. The figure put forward by the Military Governor is 10,738. It represents a drop of 5,000, or nearly one-third, over the year. The figure itself, while it comes independently in theresult from the Military Governor, is one which we have seen being worked out during the progress of our enquiry. It is one, it is fair to say, which has been framed in the light of the British manpower shortage which throughout our* Summary of Establishments and Prospective Establishments at April in each year1947 1948 1949Within the Control CommissionManpower ceiling: Essentially British Functions        6,111 4,566 2,758British Supervisory Functions        7,033 5,540 3,802Domestic Administration    ...        6,627 5,627 4,17819,771 15,733                10,738Outside the Control CommissionManpower ceiling: &apos;Non-Control Functions       ...        4,661 3,316                  1,91824,432 19,049                12,656
enquiry we have stressed at every stage. There is no special coincidence,therefore, in the fact that it seems to me a figure which, subject to one qualificationmentioned below, can reasonably be accepted. Indeed, while no infallibility willbe claimed for an estimate of this kind, thrust out across a year whose progress is shrouded in particular uncertainty, I regard this as a genuine and careiulattempt to balance all the factors in the problem.25. My only reservation concerns the figures given for the Car Organisation.It will be remembered that the Sub-Committee of the Select committee torEstimates which went to Germany recommended that among others the establish-ment of the Car Organisation should again be reviewed. This has been done, andit will be observed that numbers are being reduced from 2,381 at 1st April, 194/,to 1,747 at 1st April, 1948, and 1,200 at 1st April, 1949; but I am not at allcertain that further substantial reductions are not possible, some of which might require policy decisions. Consequently the Military Governor has agreed with me that a further official investigation should be made into this and this isnow being conducted.26. To say that the estimates are satisfactory with the one exception I have mentioned, is not to rule-out any possibility of a substantial reduction in theevent. If we could get a really efficient German administration going in western germany a Government in practice, whatever we call it by the late Summeror Autumn, it is conceivable that we might improve a good deal on the 10,738asked for, subject to the Car Organisation reservation. Any marked reductions,however, would affect only a limited range of functions. Essential British Services(Category (1)) are planned to come down from 4,566 to 2,758 and, howeversuccessful was the German Government and however many powers we devolvedon it, there would be little if any, reduction there. British Supervisory Activities(Category (2)), are due to be cut from 5,540 to 3,802 and, in theory, could descendstill more sharply if the German Government were functioning effectively, butReligious Affairs, Education, Public Safety, Political Division, Public relations and Information Services Control, and Legal, would not be much affected inthe first few months. Noticeable reductions, if any, would have to come inpractice from the Economic Group (Industry, Fuel and Power, Commerce(including Joint Export-Import Agency), Food and Agriculture, Transport,Manpower, and Finance) and also perhaps from Posts and telecommuncations and Public Health. This Group of functions is in any case being cut from ,470 to 1,254 (i.e., practically 50 per cent.), and one would have to be very sureindeed that there was no danger of a German breakdown before cutting down staffstill more drastically. I would make similar comments with regard to the regional Staffs proper, the Regional Commissioners and their staffs down to theKreis Resident Officers, i.e., the non-functional officers who are coming down from ,531 to 1,826.27. In short, if things went as well as the greatest optimist might hope,we might be able to bring the figure for 1st April, 1949, down by a few hundredfrom 10,738 but not more than that.The Year 1949-5028.   On the other hand, the figures for the year 1st April, 1949, to 1st April1950, should show an extent of reduction greater not only in degree, but in kind&apos;Of course, everything may go worse than we expect, but we may reasonably assume that during that year the Germans will be running their own show includingeg., their foreign trade. - They should be doing it as efficiently as&apos;most other european countries and, if only because of their hatred and fear of the russians in a tashion at least as friendly to Britain.Security of Tenure for the Staff (for Summary see para. 35).a n9\ T^n reP0.rt.would i?ot be complete without a reference to the morale ofthe Control Commission staff which is apt to be adversely affected by uncertainty as to their own future. J &apos;30. Security of tenure is a matter which exercises a great many of theindividual members of the staff of the Commission. There has been in Existencefor two years a scheme of granting engagements for varying periods up S
September, 1952, with compensation if the individual is discharged for redundancybefore the end of his fixed term engagement. At the present time these engage-ments are for periods running from September to September in every year from1948 to 1952, by which time of course the Commission will be so much smaller than at present as to be a different entity.31. For the great part of the present staff of the Commission, these termsare the best that it is possible to give, subject to reasonably accurate estimationof the year in which each individual is likely to cease to be required. Something,however, seems to be lacking in the manner in which the system is being operated.A number of officers are still on month to month terms of employment, or haveengagements which will expire in September, 1948. It is these officers who are most uncertain about their futures. I consider that the Commission should takeurgent steps to review all these officers and if it is clear that they will be requiredfor two or three or more years (as I am sure is the case with some of the higherofficers with whom I spoke) the Foreign Office should, as soon as possible, beasked to extend their engagements until the appropriate date. I am told thatthere is no difficulty at this end about doing this. The aim should be, so far aspossible, to give the appropriate extension at least a year before the expiry of theexisting engagement.32. Security of tenure as a phrase is often used in Parliament as well asin the Commission to mean an engagement for a much longer period than until1952. At times a career service with pension rights is envisaged. It is clear that,with the prospective run down of the Commission in the next two or three years,any such long term service must be limited to a very small proportion of themembers at present employed. Any assumption of a career service in it appearstherefore to be precluded. Nevertheless, planning for the continuance of theCommission beyond September, 1952 is already being undertaken. It is assumed that a not inconsiderable proportion of the staff then required ought to consistof established Civil Servants (from the Foreign Service as well as the CivilService) and regular officers seconded from the Services. I agree with this aimand am exploring the possibility of drawing on the Civil Service more effectivelythan in the past.33. In addition,- it may be that there is a limited number of temporary officers now in the Commission who ought to be retained indefinitely. For themit has been suggested that they should be established in the Home Civil Service,but I am told that the problem of foreseeing whether and how they could beultimately absorbed in the Civil Service at home for the completion of their careers,and the difficulties surrounding the grant of establishment otherwise than throughthe normal methods of entry, make it unlikely that this course can be adopted forany but a very few officers individually selected.34. A more general proposal which is now before the Treasury is the grantof fixed term engagements for ten or fifteen years, or even more, carrying sub-stantial rights of compensation in the event of earlier discharge for redundancy,coupled with a scheme of long service gratuities starting after seven years&apos; service.This would in fact be an extension on a more elaborate and more generous scale of the existing system inaugurated in 1945 of engagements to 1948, 1950 and 1952with compensation rights on discharge for redundancy. Our proposals have been before the Treasury since the autumn. They felt compelled to defer considerationuntil the conclusion of the recent Council of Foreign Ministers made it possible tosee the future a little more clearly. Official discussions with the Treasury have nowbeen resumed, and although I recognise the difficulty in selecting particularindividuals to whom ten or fifteen year engagements ought now to be given I hopethat they will shortly approve a scheme on these lines.35. To summarise, security of tenure for the great majority of the Corn-mission is in any case impossible but a measure of progress might be made alongthree lines: (1) The Control Commission, in conjunction with the Foreign Office, should try to operate the existing scheme of fixed engagements in such a manner as to give much more notice than at present of the intentionto extend contracts, wherever this can be ascertained in advance, sothat members of the Commission should have a clearer understandingin advance of whether they would be wanted.
(2) We should explore the possibility of drawing more effectively than in thepast on the established Civil Service in obtaining members for theControl Commission.(3) Support should be given to the plan, now under discussion with theTreasury, for a grant of fixed-term engagements for ten or fifteen years with substantial rights of compensation in the event of earlier dis-charge for redundancy, coupled with long service gratuities after the seventh year.Foreign Office, S.W.1,lUh February, 1948.
