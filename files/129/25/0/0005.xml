HIS DOCUMENT IS THE&apos;PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3  GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIALO.P.O).3) 65li-TK MARCH,  19U8CABINET3. copy NO.OVERSEAS RATION SCALES - OP THE forces memorandum by the Minister of defence at the beginning of this year I had discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and with the service ministers which led up to the adjustments in the home ration scales of the Services, approved by the Prime Minister, whichI announced in the House on 28th January.    These aimed atmaking a substantial saving in the main components of theServices1  ration which involved heavy dollar expenditure,although admittedly the result would be to make the provisionof a balanced and reasonably attractive diet for service personnel very much more difficult.    These adjustments ofthe Services&apos;  ration &quot;wore confined to Service personnel athome, including the shore establishments of the Navy in thiscountry:    but the Chancellor of the Exchequer stressed theimportance of achieving the maximum possible dollar.savingalso on the rations of members of the Forces serving abroad,and in my statement on 28th January I said that -&quot;I am examining the overseas scales to see whateconomies in hard currency expenditure are possible,  and I hope to make a further announcement on this point in the near future.;&apos;2. The Service Ration Scales Committee, under thechairmanship of Sir Frederick Aldridge of the Ministry ofFood, which had worked out the proposals on which the adjustments in the home ration scales had been based, was directed to meet at once to consider the possibility of similar adjustments in the overseas scales.    Although there is a standard basicration scale for the Forces overseas,  in practice the scalehas to be varied to meet local conditions of supply,  climate,etc,  and the methods of subsistence have to be considered in respect of four main groups, namely, European (B.A.O.R.,B.T.A.,  and Trieste), Middle East, Far East and garrisons&apos;on the Atlantic seaboards.    The calorie value . of the foodissues is 500 more than at home, except in the Far East whereit is 700 more than at home for reasons connected with the later phases of the -war, and the conditions of re-occupation,in that area.
is . Proceeding on the assumption (as in the case of thehome ration scale adjustments)  that there should he no overallreduction in the general calorie value cf the normal overseasration scale,  the Service Ration Scales Committee made proposalswhich would have the effect of applying to the overseas scalesadjustments as regards the five main &quot;dollar&quot; foods - &quot;bacon,meat, fats,  cheese and sugar - roughly proportionate withthose announced last month in the home ration scale.Quantitatively these proposals would reduce the weekly ration of bacon from the present amount of 9-025. to 5-ozs.,  of meat(including offal and sausages) from 3-lbs. 12-czs. to 2-lb3.13-ozs., and of cheese from 6-o.ao.  to h-ozs.;    as at homethere would also bo increases,  in fats from lci-cas. weeklyto 12-oss., and in sugar from 1-lb 2 2/3-oss. to 1-lb. 6-oas.At the instance of the Ministry of Food and the Treasury,  afurther additional cut.was proposed of 3-oas. a week of meat and l-oz. a week of bacon for the Forces in B.A*O.R.  subjectto compensation in other foods of equivalent calorie value.The Service representatives on the Committee made it clearthat all these proposals would require approval by higher authority in their respective Departments.4. I have had a full discussion of these proposals with the Service Ministers.    They are all firmly opposedto any adjustments on these lines in the overseas ration scales cf the Forces, except that they are prepared to agreethat the FARELF scale should lose its present lead over theother overseas scales and he brought into line with them.The basic scales at present give approximately -;,Lr0O calories5,600 caloriesThe supplement for those undergoing arduous training ordoing heavy work,  and the total resultant ration give approxi-mately the following calories t-Supplomont Total RationoOO calories h,000 calories200 calories   -      3, 800 caloriesThe Far East supplement has probably been issued more freelythan in other theatres.    It is now proposed that the approximatecalorie content of the basic scales and the :iheavy work&quot;supplement shall be respectively the same in all theatresoverseas.5* The reasons for the Service ministers  views areshortly these.    The living conditions in- the way of accommodation and also of kitchen equipment are undoubtedlyinferior in many stations to those at home.    The man abroadis entirely cut off from his home,  in strange and oftenunpleasant surroundings and without many of the normal homeamenities.    He cannot go home at weekends, to be fed by hismother or his wife as is undoubtedly the case with manysoldiers stationed at home.    The prospect of being able to compensate for somewhat severe cuts in meat, bacon and cheeseby providing more fresh fish and vegetables, which is whatEuropean, Middle East andAtlantic StationsFar East StationsEuropean, Middle Eastand Atlantic StationsFar East Stations
ISwo are proposing tc do in the case of the newly adjustedhome Service ration scales,  is a difficult one at many overseasstations,  owing to difficulties of supply and distribution,and in some cases non-availability or &quot;high prices cf localpurchases.    The Service Commit toe which examined the questionfound that after making comparable adjustments in expensivedollar items, the calorie value &quot;would be reduced and,  in theabsence of suitable sterling food Or local food replacements,the deficiency could be made good only by increasing theamount of bread tc lh-oas.  a day.    This in the opinion cfthe Service Ministers is ii;practicable for- it is alrcodydifficult to maintain reasonably attractive or indeedappetizing diet in the existing conditions and&apos;variations inclimate.    Moreover,  forces stationed in populated centreswould.find it difficult tc understand the necessity fordiscrimination between themselves and the local european population who arc not rationed in any way.6. Finally,  the Service Ministers have considerabledoubts whether the dollar saving would &quot;t. e worth thepossibility of unrest among the troops which may result ifthe proposed adjustments in their ration scales are put intoeffect.    A preliminary and necessarily very rough estimateof this saving is about $o millions a year:    the Ministry ofFood are,  I understand, trying to obtain a more accurate estimate.    The Service Ministers held that, when account istaken of the necessary alternative purchases in hard currencyareas or from dollar sources,  the figure may well prove tobe less than that estimated above.7. So far as the Navy is concerned,  the consumptionof  meat, bacon,   etc., by personnel on shore is regulatedwithin the quantities included in the ration scales for theother two Services,  and any adjustment in the latter would apply to naval personnel on shore.    The consumption in sea-going H.M. Ships is on a different basis and is related tothe scales for the Merchant Navy,    Any adjustment in the scales for sea-going ships-, would probably have to be considered in conjunction with any corresponding adjustments centeivplutodin the scales for the Merchant Navy.    I understand that theMinistry of Transport would anticipate saao difficulty inany reduction of the statutory Mercantile Marine ration,both because&apos; of possible international reactions and also of the effect upon the manning of British ships engaged inover s e a s tr a do -8. I appreciate the strength of the arguments whichmoved the Service Ministers to oppose any adjustments in the overseas ration scales of the Forces.    Moreover,  these proposed reductions are likely to have some adverse effect upon the morale of the Forces overseas, often serving in trying climatesand in difficult circumstances.    On the other hand,  I amimpressed with the very real urgency of effecting allpossible savings in the dollar expenditure of this country.A saving of the order of even $6-3 millions a year cannot be ignored even though it may only represent a snail proportionof the total dollar expenditure by-,the Services.    in my view,in general, the recommendations of the Service Ration ScalesCommittee as set out in paragraph 3 of this memorandum arereasonable and should be accepted, subject tc the following modifications i-
I would strongly deprecate any reduction of theexisting scales for our troops&apos; in Palestine, so long as theyremain in that country;    nor would I support the proposalfor aii additional cut in meat and bacon in B.A.O.R. - over and above what is proposed for other overseas stations,  sinceconditions of service for our men in Germany oeeio to mo tobe just as arduous as anywhere else,  and I see no good reason why they should be put on an inferior ration comparedwith other places overseas.    Jhoro may also have to bespecial arrangements at certain stations overseas on accountof local conditions.   As with the adjustments recentlyma do in the home ration scales,  I think that any adjustments to be made overseas should, be effected in two stages,reasonably spaced in point of time,  so as to enable thosecatering for the Services in the different overseas stations to adjust their diet plans to the now conditions.9* I therefore ask the Cabinet to decide whether :-(a) FARELF scales should be brought into line withthose of other theatres overseas, irrespective of thedecision under (b) below;(b) The proposals in paragraph 3 above for adjustments in certain major items of the overseas ration scales ofthe Forces should be carried into effect in all overseascommands,  including Far East;(c) If so, whether these adjustments should, except as regards FARELF, be ef foe tod in two stages,  the firstapproximately six weeks after the announcement and the secondthree months afterwards.    As regards B&apos;ARELF, the question to be decided, is whether if (b)  is agreed the adjustmentsshould be made in two or three stages;(d) The additional cut Mentioned in paragraph 3 above should be made in B.A.O.E.;(e) No reduction should be oiade in the existing ration scales of our troops in Palestine,  so long as they remain inthat country;    and certain stations overseas,  where speciallyadverse local conditions obtain,  should be separatelyconsidered;(f) The Minister of Transport should be invited tomake proposals for reductions in the Mercantile Marino rationand in the light of those proposals further consideration should be given to making adjustments in the ration scolesof sea-going ships of the Navy.A * V *A *Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.,4th March, 1948.
