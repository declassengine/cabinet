i THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&apos;C       confidential cp. (U8) 6UUth March,  19U8.CABINETREDISTRIBUTION OF seats memorandum by the Home secretary in the light of the representations made during the debate on the Second Reading of the Representation of thePeople Bill,  I have given further consideration to the questionof giving additional seats to English urban areas.2. In the first place, England is considerably under-represented by comparison with Scotland and Wales-.      Theaverage electorate per constituency under the proposals ofthe Boundary Commissions is 58,705 in England, 14-9,531  inScotland and 51 ,614-1  in Wales.      On the basis of the Scottishaverage, England would be entitled to on additional 90 seats,and on the basis of the Welsh average to an additional 67 seats.No doubt there arc good reasons for some weighting in favour ofScotland and Wales, but it is evident that the number of english seats could be- substantially increased withoutinjustice to those countries.      The only argument against anincrease in the number of English seats appears to be that thiswould increase the size of the House of Commons.      The Spec ker&apos;conference recommended that the total number of members of theHouse of Commons for Greet Britain should remain substantiallyas in 19UU- (i. e. 591  excluding University seats;  or a total membership of the House of 615,  including University andNorthern Irish Members).      Effect was given to this recommendation in the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act,  19I4I4.,  andno alteration was made in this respect by the amending Act of19U7.      There is,  hoy/ever, no particular significance in thefigure 615, which was originally arrived at accidentally as aresult of the reduction from 105 to 13 in the number of Irishmembers effected by the Government of Ireland Act,  1920.      Underthe&apos; Representation of the People Act,  1913, the total membership of the House wes 707.      From 1801  to 1885,  the House of commons had 658 Members;    from 1385 to 1918 there were 670 Members.3. Secondly, in England the urban areas ore under-represented in comparison with the rural areas.      There is acose for some weighting in favour of the rural areas,  and when discussed the proposed amendments of the redistribution ruleswith representatives of the Opposition in December,  191+6, itwas agreed that there should be some weighting.      I think,however,  that the Boundary Commission hove tilted the balance too far in favour of the rural areas;    for under their recommendations the average electorate per constituency is 55,3^0 for countyconstituencies and 6l,hl)-2 for borough constituencies, despite the fact that the county constituencies include 0 number of constituencies which ore predominantly urban in character, manyof which have electorates&apos; well above the. average.COPY NO.  2a
u4. There is o strong case, therefore, for granting some additional seats to English urban areas.      I recommend thatthis should be done,   and that the additional seats should be allotted as follows:-(a)    One seat each to the following boroughs:-BoroughBatterseaBlackburnEast HamGatesheadHammersmithNorwichPaddingtonReadingElectorate82,67584,641-86, 6li582,21884,88786, lj.0687,03284,068These are the eight boroughs mentioned in C.P*(48)  3,and a scheme for dividing each of them into two constituencieswas circulated with that paper.      They have particularlystrong claims for additional representation,  since theirelectorates so greatly exceed the quota and are too large tobe adequately represented by single members.(b)    One sea the tub1e b e1ow, constituency for r e c omm en da t i on s		t each to the which also s each borough and under my	large divided borough hows the average elect under- the Commission&apos; prop.sals.		0 named in irate per 3		Proposed by Commission		Present Proposals				Average		Average			elect orate		electorateBorough	Electorate	No.  of Seats	per constituency	No.  of Seats	per constituencyrmingham	759,690	12	63,308	13	58,438adf ord	213,399	3	71,133	4	53,350[istol	317,046	5	63,409	6	52,8411 dissapointed	366,917	6	61,153	7	52,417licest er	207,306	3	69,102	4	51,827jverpool	529,336	8	66,167	9	58,315nchester	499,159	8.	62,395	9	55,462fttingham	208,025	3	69,342	4	52,006Iffield	378,650	6	63,108	7	54,093It will be seen that in ee*average electorate per constituencyrecommendations would exceed 60,000,one seat in each case would leave thtThere therefore appears to be a goodseat for each of these boroughs.    ThtPlymouth, because the addition ofwould reduce the average electorate per constituency to about47,000, which seems too low.:-ch of these boroughs the under the Commission^and that the addition ofio average above 50,000.case for on additionalie list does not includethird seat in that case-2-
There are also a number of undivided boroughs inEngland-with electorates of between 60,000 and 80,000.      To givethese boroughs additional representation could be achieved only at the cost of combining port of each of them with an adjoiningarea.      It was the strong objection to the dismemberment ofboroughs in this way that led to the abandonment of the firstproposals of the Boundary Commissioners.5. The effect of these proposals would be to giveEngland a total of 506 seats.      The numbers for Scotland andWales &quot;are 71  end 36 respectively, giving a total for GreatBritain of 613.      The English seats would be divided betweenborough and county constituencies,  as followsNumber of Total Average electorateconstituencies electorates par constituencyBorough 286 16,51+0,321 57,833County   220 12,179,181 55,3&amp;0Total     506 28,719,502 56,753As a result of an informal inquiry from the Vice-Chairman of the English Boundary Commissioners,  I have been told that they could produce a scheme for    dividing the Boroughsmentioned in  paragraph h(b)  above within a w. ek or two.6. I should be glad to have the approval of the cabinet for these proposals.      If they are approved,  I would proposeto ask the Boundary Commission for England to prepare schemes forthe re-division of the boroughs named above into the proposed newnumbers of constituencies.7. It will also be necessary to amend the Third Scheduleto the House of Commons (Redistribution of Se.,te) Act,  1 9Uh, by substituting 613 for 591  in Rule 1, which at present requires thatthe number of constituencies in Great Britain shall not be substantially greater or less than&apos; 591*o .
