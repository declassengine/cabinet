felS document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS G-OVERK.IENT)secret.P.(^S) 76UTH MARCHt  19^8; CABINETSTATEMENT ON PERSONAL INCOMES,  COSTS AND PRICES:FOLLOW-UP ACTION! Memorandum by the Minister1 of Labour and national ServiceSet out below are certain stops which I proposeshould be taken to follow up the White Paper &quot;Statement on personal Incomes, Costs and Prices&quot; (Cud. 7321). I ask mycolleagues&apos; agreement to those proposals and also that anyof them who may be directly concerned will take the actionsuggested.Distribution of the White Paper2. The fullest possible circulation should be given tothe Government&apos;s statement.    Accordingly -(l)    I propose to consult with the British EmployersConfederation&apos;and the Trades Union Congress with a view to ensuring that the White paper is brought formally to thenotice of all joint voluntary negotiating bodies in industry,and of all of their respective constituent organisations.At the same time I will inform the Confederation and theTrades Union Congress of the action which I am taking inregard to Wages Councils end Wages Boards (see para. hr below) .(2)    The White Paper  should be brought formally to thenotice of all local authorities, and I would suggest that theMinister of Health and the Secretary of state for scotland should undertake to do this.&apos; (3)    I suggest also that the Minister of Health and theMinister of Education should send the White Paper to themembers of the Rushcliffe and Burnham Committees and theSecretary of State for Scotland to the corresponding ScottishCommittees.(k).   I consider it most desirable that other ministers concerned should take similar steps to bring the statement to the notice of bodies and authorities concerned with prices and profits.    The Government must avoid any charge that theyare more active in seeing that the principles of the white paper are observed in connection with wages than in connectionwith prices and profits.-1-COPY NO.
3. I do not consider that it -would be appropriate tosond the White Paper to the National Arbitration Tribunal,the Industrial Court and other arbitration authorities.The members of these bodies vail all bo fully aware of theGovernment^ statement and can be trusted to have regard toit when making their awards.   To send the White Paper tothem formally might be interpreted as giving them a Governmentdirective on the subject of wages and this, by diminishingthe present regard for their independence, would seriously-weaken their standing in the eyes of both sides of industry.It is of vital importance to maintain the position of the arbitration authorities at the present time and to avoidtaking action which would weaken it. nWages Councils and Wages Boardsh* Proposals by Wages Councils and. Wages Boards(excepting the Agricultural Wages Board)  for wage increases have to be confirmed by me before an Order giving effectto the proposals can bo made.    In the past it has been mynormal practice to confirm such proposals unless there werelegal   or other technical considerations which made it undesirable.    In future I propose to require the WagesCouncil when submitting proposals to satisfy me that theyhave had full regard to the considlerations set out in theWhite Paper.    I shall.inform Wages Councils and Wages boards of my decision and request them when submitting proposals in future to set out their reasons for considering that the wage increase proposed is in accordance with the principles set out in the White Paper.    In some cases Wages Councilshave already agreed on proposals which,  in the ordinary way,they would shortly be submitting to me for confirmation.In the letter which I shall be sending to Wages Councils andBoards I propose to suggest that in such casos they should consider whether their proposals should be re-examined inthe light of the principles set out in the &quot;White Paper before being sent on to me.    I attach a copy of the letter which IX^roposeto send to the Councils.5. The Orders of the Agricultural Wages Board arcnot subject to confirmation by me or the Minister ofAgriculture, and I suggest that the appropriate action intheir case is for copies of the White Paper to be broughtformally to the attention of,the two sides.Prices,  charges or mar,gins6. Departments responsible for controlling prices and margins or giving subsidies or grants will in future haveto consider whether or not a wage increase which has beengranted is in accordance with the principles of the white paper.    I appreciate that they will not be able to reach adecision on this point alone and- will normally liave to consultother Departments;,  including the ministry&apos;- of Labour.   MyDepartment when consulted will provide all available informationrelative to the wage increase and advise on its relation to theprinciples. set out in the White Paper.    The decision as to whether,in any particular case and having regard to all the circumstances,the application for an increase in profits,  etc should be met and to what extent should,  however,  in my view, be for the Depart-ment responsible.    It is imperative that any views which myDepartment express should not be disclosed.G. A . I .Ministry of Labour and National Service.- hth March, 19i(-8.
annex proposed letter to the Secretary, &quot;wagesBeards and CouncilsI am directed by the Minister of Labour and NationalService to refer to the statement on Personal Incomes, Costs,and Prices which was published as a White Paper on.14-th February, 1948.As was made clear in the subsequent debate inParliament on Thursday, 12th February, the present economicsituation in the country calls for the utmost co-operationthroughout industry and the Minister trusts,  therefore, thatwhen considering any-matter likely to affect personal incomes,costs and prices, Wages Boards and Wages Councils will have full regard to the- principles of the White Paper, a copy ofwhich is enclosed for information.As Wages Boards and Councils will appreciate,  theMinister will be under a duty henceforward when consideringwages regulation proposals, to be satisfied that in.reaching the proposals full regard has boon had to the principles ofthe White Paper.   For this purpose I am to request that any proposals submitted should now be accompanied by a memorandum explaining the considerations that have led the Board orCouncil to form the opinion that its proposals are in accordancewith those principles.    There are no doubt cases in whichproposals have already been advertised and any representationshave either been considered or are under consideration;    insome cases Indeed the Board or Council may already havearrived at conclusions as to the proposals which they desireto submit to the Minister.    The Minister feels that in all those cases a further opportunity should be given to thoseentitled to make representations to consider the proposals in the light of the White Paper.   Accordingly, save in exceptional circumstances,  it will bo desirable to re-publish the proposals and it would greatly contribute to the avoidance of delay if Boards and Councils will forthwith make arrange-ments accordingly,    a possible exception to this rule might-be where the period for lodging of representations previouslyallowed had provided an adequate interval after hth Februaryfor the consideration of the proposals by all concerned inthe light of the White Paper.    Even in such cases,  however,the Minister will wish to be satisfied that the Board orCouncil has itself reviewed the proposals in the light ofthe White Paper.I am to request that you will bring this letterto the notice of all Wages Boards and Councils without delay.
