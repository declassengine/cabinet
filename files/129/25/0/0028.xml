i c&quot;. L. .n/IMS DOCUMENT lib THE PROPERTY OF HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVBRMCBNT)confidential.P.(Lt6;  S 16TH MARCH..  lQbSCABINETEFFECT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL on parliamentary PROCEDUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerWhen the new Local Government Bill becomes lew,it will have an effect upon Pc.rliamentc.ry procedure whichwill affect a number of Bills now before Parliament andtherefore requires urgent consideration.2. As my -colleagues know,  the Bill provides a new system of &quot;equalisation&quot; grants in lieu of the presentblock grant.      Under this&apos; new&apos;system grants arc to be madeto local authorities tho rateable values of whose are as per head of population fall below the average.      The amount ofthe grant in each case turns on two factors -(a) the - amount by which the rateable value-in the area of the authority falls belowthe average;    and(b) the expenditure of the local authority or local authorities concerned.In effect,  the Exchequer pays rates    on imaginary propertyof a rateable value equal to the difference between therateable value of the particular authority and the averagerateable value.      Under the old Block grant, new expenditure by a local authority only affected  the amount of the grant to the extent that the total grant in the next quinquenniumwould be related to the total expenditure of all authorities.Under the new scheme, new expenditure by an authority is tohave an immediate effect on the grant to that authority.3. A consequence of this is that when in the courseof the next few.days the Local Government Bill becomes law,a Financial&apos;Resolution will be required to support any bill which affects rateable values up or down,  and any Bill whichactually or potentially increases expenditure of a localauthority as to which it is not expressly, declared th; t i-t isnot to count for grant.      The House authorities having taken the .view that the&apos; Bill and the existing rules of procedurehave this combined  effect,  we cannot question it,  though wecan,  of course,  if we so desire,   ask the House to amend therules of procedure.h. The immediate problem for consideration is theregularised ion of the position of Bills now before parliament,but before considering this transitional problem,  it would Ithink be well to clear our minds as to what the future positionis to be.      So far as Public Bills are c-ncerned,  I see nojcsfZo
reason why those introduced after the Local Government Billbecomes lew should not, if they effect rr.tc-r.blo values up on down or authorise r.n increased charge on the. rates, haveto be covered by a. Financial Resolution authorising any consequential! increase in &quot;equalisation&quot; grant;,  just asa Bill which authorises an increased charge on the rates which would attract,  say,  education grant has to bo coveredby a Financial Resolution.      This would also hove  the consequence that an amendment affecting rateable ^values orauthorising an increased charge on the rates could not be moved to a Bill unless the Bill, was suppertee by a financial Resolution ./hich covered the- proposal containedin the amendment.5. When wc com.   to Private Bills,   the position isnot so simple.      The combination of Private Bill andFinancial Resolution,  though not&apos; technically impossible,is so awkward that the probable practical effect ofrequiring any class of Private Bill to bo supported by a financial Resolution would be  to hill  that class of Billaltogether.     No harm would., I think, be done if it w.romade impossible to  affect rateable vain s by Private Bill,but the position as regards rate-borne expenditure ismore difficult.6. Municipal Corporations have a considerablefondness for gathering together oil th .ir spending pewc-rsin Private Bills of formidable dimensions,   the clauses ofwhich are largely in common form,  coo.; the Po rli ament-aryAgents naturally do not discourage them.     To make all this impossible,  or at any rate very difficult,   by requiring Private Bills authorising rate-borne  expenditure to be supported by Financial Resolutions would create aconsiderable hue and cry,  as well as fortifying thesuspicions of  these who  see sinister intentions, or at anyrate possibilities,  of control in Clause 6 of the Local -Government Bill, which enables the Minister to adjustequalisation grant in respect of excessive or unreasonablelocal expenditure.7.       .       On the other hand Local Authorities should nutin my view be handed a blank cheque in the f .rm of excusingPrivate Bill legislation from the requirement of a financial Resolution without some alternative see?. guard.Such a safeguard might be found in a Standing Order thatit be an instruction to all Committees that, if so required on behalf of the Crown,   they shall not pass a elao.seauthorising an increased charge en local rates withoutadding a proviso  that expenditure  thereunder shall be excluded in calculating expenditure w-n which equalisationgrant is payable.      The effect of this would be that any-local authority proposing to take novel spending powers    by private Bill would have to take soundings of the Ministryof Health,  end would probably emit any clause- to which theywere told that the proviso would be required.8. Such an arrangement would,  however, be inapplicableto Scottish Private Bill Legislation,  which originates ina provisional order under the Private Legislation Procedure(Scotland) Act, 1936.      Normally the order, whore necessaryafter enquiry before commissioners,  is made by the Secretaryof State and scheduled  to a confirming Bill which is deemedto be a Public Bill out&apos; to have passed through all stagesup to and    includinrr Committee.      This form of procedure is not confined  to Scotland.      The Statutory Orders (Special
Procedure) Let,  1945.  lays down a sotnewhrt similar procedure; for the confirmation of certain orders whichthe Minister thinks it expedient to confirm by Bill.The position as regards those confirming Bills requiresfurther consideration.      It may be that we shell reach-the conclusion that ouch Bills cannot be left, like other Public Bills,  to the operation of  the normal rules of procedure.      This,  however,  is a point of relativedetail that wo need net decile at once.9. Turnine now too  the  transitional position,  I am advised that a resolution is required to regularise thoposition of Bills (Public and Private) now beforeParliament which impose charges en the rat-, s and are either unsupported by Financial Resolutions or supportedby Resolutions net authorising consequential increase-s ofequalisation grant.      There are a number of public bills in this latter category.     Alternative el rafts of thenecessary Ros -lution a.re appended.      In moving theResolution,  the Government spokesman should., I  think,explain that while tho position will be further exploredbefore next session,  the Government do net,   as at presentadvised,  contemplate asking the House to amend thoexisting rules of procedure under which. Bills affectingrateable value up or down, and Public Bills authorisingrate-borne expenditure, will heve to be supported by financial Resolutions covering tie. c on sequential charge on the Exchequer via the equalioation grant:    but that inthe case cf private legislation authorising rate-borne&quot;expenditure  they contemplate that some modification inthe rules of procedure may be required.R.
