secret.P.(U8) 80QTH MARCH.   iqL8CABINETMONOPOLISTIC PRACTICES bill memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI undertook yesterday to circulate a further paper in order to set out certain developments since my earlier memorandum (CP. (L8) 73) was drafted and to deal with anumber of points which have been raised by my colleagues andwhich I have discussed with them.2, Further developments and points on the matters dealt with in CP.(U-8) 73 are as follows:-(a)    SanctionsIt has been suggested&apos; to me that, the powers   in theBill are not strong enough, particularly as against monopoliesroad trusts.    We have not taken power to break up trusts andmonopolies by Order,  since the whole approach of this Billis the control of the abuse of monopoly, rather than itsdestruction.      Personally,  I am very doubtful whether,  havingregard to the risks to our industrial and producing powerinvolved, we should wish in this country to break up a monopoly on. the grounds of a particular abuse of its powers,but if wo did we should, I am sure, have to proceed byspecific legislation and not by Statutory Instrument.     Theultimate remedy is, of course, nationalisation.     My beliefis thet in the ordinary case price control (which will beavailable for use in connection with the objects of the Bill)will be found to be much the most effective weapon when dealingwith the abuse of monopoly power, which usually takes the formof the sale of goods at excessive prices,     Sub-Clauses 11 (2)(c) and (d) also confer power.of control over the abuse of monopoly in such matters as boycotts and loyalty rebates,(c)    Public interest on further consideration,  I am sure that to give directions to the Commission would be&apos;inconsistent with itssemi-judicial character and would be extremely difficult tojustify in the House - it would look like setting up an impartial quasi-judicial tribunal and then retaining power to influence its judgment,     A provision under which the commission would be obliged to take account of a resolution passed byParliament would,&apos; I fear, be little less open to objectionfrom this point of view.    As I have said in C.P.(L8) 73, Ibelieve that in practice our conception of the public interest-in these matters will grow up out of the investigations carriednCOPY NO.     ?-0-1-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
ou,t by the Commission and of the informal interchange of viewsbetween the Board of Trade and the Commission,  and finally ofthe debates in Parliament on the Commission&apos;s Reports and&apos; onany Orders which may be made.      In practice,   therefore, I donot believe that we should want often, if at all,  to use thepower of direction on a matter of this kind.      I am thereforenow inclined to favour the omission of Clause 9,(d) Position of Other departments as I have pointed out in my earlier paper,   theBill provides (i)    for all references to the Commission tobe made by, the Board of Trade;    and (ii)    for the Board cfTrade to be the-sole Order-making Department.(i)    It is essential that all references to theCommission, whether for an investigation (Clause 2 (1)),  orfor advice (Clause 2 (2)), should go through the Board ofTrade, but it is clearly understood that the Board would notrefer a case to the Commission for investigation, exceptafter consultation and agreement with, the responsible-production department.     Similarly,  the Board would not takethe initiative in asking the Commission for advice under clause 2 (2)  in connection with industries for which otherDepartments are responsible.     I understand that the Ministerof iigriculture is anxious that I should make some statement to  this effect on Second Reading,  so as  to make it clear thatthe Board would not initiate enquiries for advice from theCommission in connection with the activities of marketing boards.      I am certainly prepared to make ouch a statement.I should, perhaps, explain that my expectation isthat this particular Clause will be used primarily inconnection with requests from private industry for advice on arrangements which they propose to make and are not preparedto sign (once this Bill becomes an net), without first-ascertaining whether they are likely to be the subject ofenquiry and objection.(ii)    I am quite prepared to meet the views of mycolleagues who wish to have the power to sign Orders underthis Bill affecting .industries for which they are responsible;I had of course always contemplated that while, in order tosecure co-ordination,  the President of the Board of Trade-would sign,  the Production Department would negotiate theOrders and answer for them in the House.     There will,&apos;-onthe other hand, undoubtedly be cases (e.g. where more thanone Production Department is concerned) in which the Boardof Trade should sign for other Departments.     Parliamentarydraftsmen have accordingly been asked  to include a clause-under which the various Production Ministers, including, ofcourse,  the Agriculture Ministers, would be competent authorities for the purpose of making Orders under the Bill.I am sure that,  while this change is desirable, it is essentialthat- the Board of Trade should, be recognised as the co-ordination authority in regard  to the Orders made under theBill and that they should also co-ordinate on drafting, because it would be most undesirable to - have a number of differentinterpretations of the same provisions.(e) Restrictive Practices of Trade UnionsI mentioned in CP. (ho) 73 that we might have to
-deal with substantial criticism of the fact that the Billdoes not deal with these.      My colleagues may have noticed that during the Debate on the Board of Trade Vote last weekMr. Brendan Bracken stated  that the opposition attitude,would be to welcome the Bill,  and    indeed try to strengthenit,  but only on the understanding that it extends to the restrictive Practices of Trade Unions.3. The following further points have arisen since my paper was drafted,  or have been raised by ray colleagues.(i)    Definition of Imperfect competition in the present draft of the Bill the definitionClauses 3, h and 5 are so drawn that conditions of imperfectcompetition can only be supposed by the Board of Trade or beheld by the Commission to prevail,  if more- than one half ofthe goods supplied or processed or produced in the UnitedKingdom are covered by the arrangements.     Wo do no t knowat present of any cases which are likely to requireinvestigation which would not in fact fall within thisdefinition.     Some doubt, however, has been expressed as towhether this definition might not be found in the event to exclude a few cases which ought to be covered, and would inany case load,  through rdministrative caution,  to the reference only of cases where in fact the percentage wasmaterially greater.      In these- circumstances it is proposedto substitute in the BiTl a lower figure - namely one-third -above which cases can be considered.Personally, I should myself have preferred to usesome general words such as &quot;a substantial proportion&quot; butI am advised by the legal pundits that these would be much too wide,  since  they might be held to cover firitis supplyingas little as 10 per cent, of the market.      I am afraid  thatany figure wo choose will bo subject  to criticism as beingeither too high or too low, but if we are to t aloe a figure.I am in-favour of taking a low one and justify it as a .minimum which has been chosen to allow both us end theCommission a reasonable discretion.(il)    FQllow-Tro^c^i^nIt may wall be that in place of the sanctionsprovided in the Bill or of price control, it may be desirableto require the offender or offenders to  take some action,  suchas&apos; changing the. methods of management or the introduction of improved accounting systems.      It is, perhaps, likely thatsuch recommendations would be accepted by those concerned,&apos; ifthey were alternative to an Order under the Act, but unless they&apos; were followed up at a later date, little might bo done to put matters right.      I  think,  therefore,   that we shouldhave power to request the Commission tc  investigate end reporton the extent to which such recommendations have been carried into effect and Parliamentary draftsmen have been asked, to draft an additional clause- to this general effect.(iii)    The position of Northern Ireland&apos; .There has as yet been no definite rc-ply from theNorthern Ireland Government as to whether they would wish tobe included in the Bill.      This from our point of view, isdesirable since an investigation of industries, part of whichare sited in Northern Ireland,&apos; to be effective would need . to
extend to  that part and there might be possibilities ofevasion of the Bill if Northern Ireland were excluded.    Iam hopeful that the Bill will be acceptable to them if somewords are included in the- Bill which make clear that it doesnot act in any way as a restriction, upon the powers of theNorthern Ireland Government.(iv)    Shipping and inland transportAll forms of transport have been left    out of theBill at the request of the Ministry of Transport.     I do not wish to&apos; raise any objection to their being left   out,provided that it can be argued that they are sufficientlycovered from this point of view by other policies orprocedures.     In the case of inland transport, it can, i assume, be argued that the nationalised authorities have asufficient control over the- whole field;    in the case ofshipping,  I assume that the Minister of Transport will beable to give me a suitable answer to critics who ask whyshipping is excluded, having regard to the &quot;undoubtedexistence in this industry of restrictive practices in the shape of the Shipping Conferences.(v)    TitleA number of titles have been discussed.      All are subject to some objection.     The best seem to be &quot;Monopoly(Enquiry and Public Control) Bill&quot; and either &quot;MonopolyPractices Commission&quot; or the still shorter title- &quot;MoncpolyCommission&quot;.H.W.Board of Trade, S.W.  1.,9th March,  194-8.
