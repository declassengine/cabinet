(u,8) 787TH MARCH. 19U8TALKS ON germany memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsInformal talks on Germany among delegations of theUnited Kingdom, United States and France opened in london on 23rd February.     A delegation from the Benelux countriestook part in the conversations from 26th February,      Theconference went into recess on 6th March and will meet againabout the middle of April to continue discussions and to make recommendations covering the whole field of the Agenda.      TheAgenda of the meeting is attached (Annex A).     A communiqueon the purpose and results of the talks was issued on 6th March. . .2.      The Benelux delegation took part in the talks on equalterms on all items of the agenda except those of exclusiveconcern to the delegations of the three Occupying Powers,namely, item (B) (Relationship of Western Germany to theEuropean Recovery Programme),  Item (E)  (Special aspects of theReparation question raised by the United States Government)and certain aspects of item (F)  (Evolution of the political andeconomic organisation of the three Western Zones) such asTrizonal Fusion.3*      It was agreed from the outset that no attempt should bemade to reach final conclusions on the whole agenda.      Wherea common vie?/ was reached the resulting agreement would be reported to the Governments concerned, and final recommendations on. the German problem as a whole would be left until theconference resumed after the recess.J+.      In the event, the talks proved more successful than hadbeen expected, both the United States and French delegationsshowing a greater disposition to make concessions than had appeared likely.      This was particularly true of item (C)(Control of the Ruhr) and Item (F) (Character of the futureGerman Government),5.      The following is a brief account of the results of the talks under the various items of the Agenda:-6.     Association of Benelux countries in policy regarding GermanyIt was agreed that the Benelux Governments should beinvited in a similar way to similar conversations about germany in the future and that there should be frequent exchanges ofview with them on Germany through the diplomatic channel.      Itwas also agreed that the claim of the Benelux: Governments to be associated in the preparation of the German Peace Treaty shouldbe supported as in the past.copy no.   ^0CAB MET
A point which caused some difficulty was the claim of the benelux Governments to ho consulted by the Occupying Powersbefore decisions were taken by the latter on matters affectingthe government of Western Germany, which might be of special interest to the Benelux Governments.      After a good deal ofdiscussion, it Was decided to recommend a form of consultationwhich might in practice meet the wishes of the Benelux Governments,The Delegations of the Occupying Powers did not feel that theycould commit their Governments to consult the BeneluxGovernments before talcing action,   irrespective of its nature,which they might regard as necessary for the proper administrationof their Zones,      It was, however, agreed that the BeneluxGovernments had an interest in being well-informed on thesematters.     The three Military Governors would therefore beasked to make arrangements for a close association with the benelux Representatives in Germany.7*      Association of Commonwealth countries the United Kingdom Delegation have throughout borne in mind the position of the Commonwealth countries with regard to policy on Germany.      They will be kept informed of developments, andwo shall welcome any observations - which they may desire to make,8.      Relationship of Western Germany under the Occupying Powersto the European Recover:/ programme the United Kingdom, United States and French Delegationsagreed to recommend that the Anglo-American&apos; Combined Zone and theFrench Zone should each be treated as an independent participatingarea and should be fully associated by adequate representation on inter-governmental bodies set up under the European recovery programme.  (See Report at Annex B).      It was also agreed thatclose co-operation should be established among the Governmentsof the Western Occupying Powers and among the occupation authorities in Western Germany in all matters arising out of theEuropean Recovery Programme in relation to Western Germany,Such co-operation was essential if Western Germany.was to make its full and proper contribution to European recovery.      The two areas of Germany would be represented by Allied officialsrepresenting the Occupating Authorities;  the occupation authorities might be expected to use German advisers and experts to assist them-.9.      Proposals in the above sense will be presented at theforthcoming meeting of the Committee of European economic co-operation, and it is- hoped that the two areas will berepresented for the first time on the working party set up atthat meeting,10.    Role of the Gorman Economy in the European Economy, andControl of the RuhrThe discussions on this item were unexpectedly succesful and provisional agreement was reached on the text of a draft agreement for the establishment of an International ControlAgency,     The text of this draft is annexed (Annex C).11,    Considerable concessions were made by the French who nolonger insist upon the separation of the Ruhr from Germany,or on international ownership or on international management,12.    The preamble lays down two principles.      The first is thatthe Ruhr shall not again be used for purposes of aggression, andthat access to the coal, coke and steel of the Ruhr shall not besubject to the exclusive control of Germany, but that access tothem for the benefit of an extensive area of Europe, including
IllGermany, shall he -without discrimination.      The second is thatthere should be close association between the economic life of the countries of Western Europe on the one hand and of a democratic Germany on the other.13.    The International Control Agency, which is to be set upin the Ruhr before the establishment of a Provisional GermanGovernment, will be composed of representatives of theUnited States,  United Kingdom, France, The Netherlands, Belgium,Luxembourg and Germany.      It will take its decisions by majority vote,  the three Occupying Powers in Germany havingthree votes each and the three Benelux Powers one each.      Duringthe period of occupation, the three German votes will beexercised by the Powers responsible for the economicadministration of the Ruhr, that is to say by the United States,and United Kingdom jointly, until such time as Trizonal Fusioncomes about, when France will share with the other two powers in the exercise of the German votes.      This means that Francewill not have an equal voice with the United Kingdom and united States until she fuses her Zone &quot;with theirs. &quot;lii.    During the occupation period,  the functions of theInternational Control Agency are limited to the determination of the allocation of coal, coke and steel from the Ruhr asbetween German consumption and export.      So far as coal and cokeare concerned, this is already a Trizonal matter,,      TheInternational Control&apos;Agency will also have the right, in theoccupation period, to require regular reports on the production,distribution and consumption of Ruhr coal, coke and steel.In effect, during this period, the powers of the Commanders in chief are very little affected.15*    After the occupation period,  the International ControlAgency win assume certain further duties at present reserved to the Occupying Powers,      They will, for example, exercise control of the allocation of coal,  coke and steel for internalGerman consumption so far as this is necessary to ensure thatthe allocations for exports are carried out and that the Germansdo not use&apos; artificial measures or practices which would distortthe movement in international trade of coal coke and steel from the Ruhr,     The enforcement of disarmament provisions wouldalso be transferred to the International Control Agency, if theyhad not already been allotted to any other authority; in that event the Germans would&apos;have no vote.16.    In agreeing to this text, all delegations made it clearthat they did so in a provisional way and would only be able togive their definite assent to it when they had been able toconsider the final results achieved on other aspects of the german problem which were before the conference..17.    Security against GermanyThis subject was somewhat summarily touched upon in thediscussions.      The French requirements were:-*(i) Permanent occupation of the Ruhr and Rhineland;(ii) International control of the Ruhr;(iii) A disarmament treaty on the lines of the so calledByrnes Treaty, adapted for three-Power purposes;(iv) A security arrangement on the lines now being discussedamong the Western Powers;(v) Agreement on the establishment of a future GermanGovernment of a loose federal character.-3-
18.    The United States representative v/as not in a positionto make any statement of a positive character in plenary session on Items  (i)&apos;,  (iii) and  (iv).      It was decided to revert tothis question when the Delegations reassembled after the recess.19,    ReparationsI have already reported to my colleagues on the american proposals on this subject in a separate paper.20.    Evolution of the Political and Economic Organisation ofGermanyThe discussion on this topic fell into two parts.      Thefirst related to the character and method of establishment ofa future German Government;  the second to measures to be takento harmonize immediate policies in the Anglo-American combinedArea and the French Z0ne, as a step towards Trizonal Fusion.21.    The conversations on the first aspect of this question wereunexpectedly successful and a most useful report Was produced(Annex D) showing clearly the points on which agreement wasreached  (these were both wider and more numerous than had been thought likely) and the questions which still remain to be resolved.     A working party will be set up in Berlin to study the outstanding questions, and it is hoped that a report willbe available after the recess.22.    As regards the more immediate measures in the Zones, whilethe French showed no enthusiasm for Trizonal Fusion, and indeeddeclared that they must make this dependent upon their receivingsatisfaction on other questions, it was readily agreed that thepresent practices &quot;in the Combined Area should be studied inBerlin and the comments of the French given due consideration,and more important, that steps  should be taken immediately toharmonize administration and other polices in the Combined area and the French Zone, in order to pave the way for TrizonalFusion in due course.23*    Provisional Territorial arrangements as time was short and as the Benelux Delegation did not seem to be anxious to have their territorial claims discussed,it was decided to defer consideration of this item until after the recess.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.I.7TH MARCH, I9h.8.

From this concept flows theUnited States Delegations attitude as to the division ofPowers between Federal and Land Governments,  as containedin Federal and Land Constitutions, the importance of federal Judiciary, the power of the Federal Government tolevy its own taxes, and the necessity of the maintenance of federal Administrative Agencies to execute FederalLegislation,The United States and United Kingdom Delegations considerthat no individual should be a member of the FederalLower House and a Landtag at the same time,-The French and Benelux Delegations consider thatsimultaneous membership of both bodies should be permissible.

After some discussion on the advisability of the creation,md on the different methods of election and different powers of) Chief of State, opinion remained divided; this matter should5e clarified by further discussion in Berlin. VISION OF POWERS&apos;BETWEEN FEDERAL HOUSESLO.

11.    IT WAS AGREED that the two Houses should enjoy equal-powers of initiating legislation, except that the initiation of money, hills might he reserved to theLower House, and- that there might &quot;he certain powersreserved to the Upper House, e,g.  in connection withForeign Affairs and the confirmation of certainappointments.DIVISION OF POWERS BETWEEN FEDERAL AND LAND GOVERNMENTS12,    IT WAS AGREED: --  (a) That the Federal Government should enjoy only those powers expressly delegated to it under theConstitution;(b) That the study of the detailed division of powers should he remitted to Berlin on the understandingthat in no case should the following powers hedelegated to the Federal Government:-Education, Public Health, Public Welfare,Police, Cultural and Religious affairs andLocal Government.TAXATION13.

The French Delegation considers that the power to collecttaxes should invariably rest with the Land Government, exceptin the case of customs duties.The Benelux Delegation inclines towards the view of theFrench Delegation.The United States and United Kingdom Delegations considerthat it woyld be necessary for the Federal Government to enjoy the power of collection in certain specified cases.FEDERAL JUDICIARYJ15.    IT WAS AGREED: .(a) That there should be a Federal Supreme Court with thepower to settle conflicts between Federal and LandAuthorities, and with appelate jurisdiction to protect the civil rights of individuals against acts by theFederal Government, and to ensure the application,with due regard for uniformity, of Federal Lav/;(b) That the Germans should be instructed to establish a system ensuring the complete independence of the judiciary from the Legislative and Executive branchesof the Government.

Consideration shouldbe given in Beilin to the revision of the boundaries and tothe best method of associating the Germans therewith.It was understood that for the purpose of this study noonsideration would be given to.the convenience of the presentccupation troops, - &apos;.
COMPOSITION Off&apos; THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY22.    IT WAS AGREED(a) that the Constituent Assembly should be formed on abasis which would achieve a compromise between the  ,principle of equal Land representation and theprinciple of reprusentation in proportion to Landpopulations.      This basis should be worked out inBerlin.(b) that it is not essential to have Trizonal fusion beforethe Constitution comes into force,23*    There was no agreement on the question of whether theConstituent Assembly should be composed of representatives&quot;of the Laender&quot;,&quot;from the Laender&quot;, or &quot;of the people of theLaender&quot;.TIME ALLOTTED FOR THE WORK OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY2^*    IT WAS AGREED that this should be considered in Berlin,RATIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION25.
