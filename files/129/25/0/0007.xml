Thenumber at work in cotton spinning rose to 97,950 in the second week of February.The number on the colliery books increased from 718,000 at the beginning ofthe year to 722,000 in the third week of February an average rise of 570 a week.II. Produotion2. The index of industrial production (1946 = 100) for December was 117compared with 106 in December 1946. For the year 1947 as a whole industrial production is estimated at 9 per cent, higher than in 1946.Interim index of total industrial productionJanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember34996		Percentage1947	1946	change106	89	+ 19-085	95	-11 099	97	4- 1-8105	96	410-3110	101	4 8-9116	98	+ 18-0108	96	4-12-8105	94	+ 12-2116	106	4 9-6121	110	4- 9-2122	111	4- 9-5117	106	+ 10-2
Coal3. For the first seven weeks this year output of deep-mined coal averaged3-95 million tons a week 268,0.00 tons a week (or 7-3 per. cent.) greater than during the corresponding period last year. Output per man shift is being maintained at about 1 -10 tons nearly 4 per cent, greater than in January 1947.4. Production of opencast coal has risen to 204,000 tons in the last week of February.Production of deep-mined coal	Production			Output per man shift overall			1948	1947	Percentage	1948	1947	Percentage	Th. tons	Th. tons	change	Tons	Tons	changeJanuary 						1st week	3,942	3,780	4- 4-3	1-09	1-07	+ 1-92nd week	4,012	3,745	+ 7-1	1 10	1-07	+2-shored week	3,934	3,710	-f 6-0	109	1-07	4-1-94th week	3,965	3,626	-4- 9-3	111	1-06	4-4-7February-						1st week, - ...	3,878	3,408	4-13-8	1-09	1-03	4-5-82nd week	3,969	3,651	4-8-7	1-10	1-06	4-3-83rd week	3,925	3,831	+ 2-5	110	1-07	H-2-84th week	3,878	3,652	4- 6-2			9*5. Distributed stocks of coal at 14th February amounted to 14f million tons million tons more than at the same time last year. More coal is being sent abroad. At present deliveries of coal for export and bunkers are about200,000 tons a week but it is hoped to raise the amount of coal available for export and bunkers from 15 to 18 million tons in 1948 provided contracts can be negotiated.Steel6. 289,000 tons of steel ingots and castings were produced in each of thefirst two weeks of February. Output of pig iron also increased and amounted to177,000 tons in the second week of the month. Stocks of pig iron have fallensince the end of 1947 from 452,000 to 402,000 tons but it is expected that theywill be maintained at about this level during the next three months. Stocks of scrap continue to fall.Cotton spinning7. The output of cotton yarn is rising, and in the second week of Februaryamounted to 15-6 million lbs. Output of cotton yarn this year has been asfollows : 1937 weekly average1948-January 3   ...10   ...,,      17  ...24   ...,,      31 .....February 7   ...14Millionlbs.23-712 914-715015-15-15-12-415-6Motor Vehicles8. Production of motor vehicles rose in January. 25,184 passenger motor vehicles were produced and 16,792 of these were for export. 6,144 commercialmotor vehicles were produced for export in January the highest total achievedso far.   Output of commercial vehicles for the home market was again lower.Coal Mining Machinery9. Production of cutters and conveyors for home use was less in Januarythan in December, but the output of colliery tubs and mining cars rose from 4,640to 5,160 tons.
III.-Building10. Since last August, when the first cuts in capital investment were made,,fewer houses have been started each month and fewer new contracts for housesawarded. The number of houses completed each month has been greater than thenumber started and in consequence the outstanding number under constructionhas been reduced. At the end of January, however, there were 247,000 permanent houses in Great Britain under construction.11. One effect of the cuts in the house-building programme has been the fallin the demand for bricks. Deliveries of building bricks fell from 463 million inOctober to 305 million in January and stocks rose from 260 to 427 million.Building Bricks (Millions)StocksProduction   Deliveries   End of Period1938 monthly average        ... 6501947 monthly average        ... 378 372 3481947 October ...... 467 463 260November        ...... 410 381 289December        ...... 388 336 3481948 January ...... 386 305 428IY. Petroleum Products12 Total imports of petroleum products have declined steadily since last September but consumption is still at a high level. Stocks continue to falland are expected to amount to only 2-63 million tons by the middle of April. Inconsequence largely of the abolition of the basic petrol allowance, consumption of motor spirit has been cut from about 100,000 to 74,000 tons a week and stocks arenot expected to decline any further in the near future. Consumption of gas, dieseland fuel oil has increased steadily during 1947 to 156,000 tons a week in January1948 and stocks are expected to fall from 844,000 (5^ weeks consumption) to608,000 tons at the middle of April. The supply position of fuel oil for bunkersin particular is causing anxiety.Y. External Trade13. British exports rose in January to a record level of  119-5 million or28 per cent, in volume above the average of 1938. Exp orts of metal goods consti-tute half the value of our exports and were  16 million greater in January 1948than in January 1947. Exports of textiles at  23-4 million were only  4-million more than a year ago.14. Imports also rose in value in January to  161 - 8 million and were greaterthan in any month except last August and September.	/anuary	July	January		1948	1947	1947		 m.	 m.	 m.

Balance of Payments15.   The heavy rate of drain on reserves recorded in January continued in the first three weeks of February.   During this period it amounted to  37^million, that is, at a rate of  12^ million per week; or only very,slightly less than34996 &quot; b 2
in January when the drain during the whole month amounted to  57 a million.Once again the special factors noted in the previous report have been operative;there have been heavy payments to Canada, Belgium has continued to take gold( 11 million since the beginning of the year) and drawings by India and Pakistanhave been large. It now appears that the total drain in the first two monthsmay be around  110 million. This is much in excess of the rate of loss estimated for the first half of the year in the paper on the Dollar Programme in 1948 (OP.(48) 35); viz.  222 million. But the special factors already mentioned, which have contributed to this excess, are either non-recurring or are likely to be much diminished in future. For example, India and Pakistan have already drawnpractically all they are entitled to in the first half of this year under our recentagreements. It is hoped that the drain to Belgium will cease. Very little moreshould be paid to Egypt. Finally it should be possible to claim from SouthAfrica reimbursement for the dollars made available to her since 1st January.Precise details of these amounts are not yet known but the total may be as large as 10 million.16. Though it is likely, therefore, that the total net drain in the first half-year will be larger than the estimate of  222 million in CP. (48) 35 the excessshould be considerably less than would be implied by the rate of drain in the first two months.Total net drain on reserves[l)1947 :-   million467133First half.JulyAugustSeptemberOctober   ..NovemberDecember156936759481948 :-January..................       57^(l) Including drawings on United States and Canadian credits and the InternationaMonetary Fund.YII. Bilateral Negotiations17. Since the date of my last report, negotiations have been concluded with denmark, India and Pakistan. Negotiations are continuing with Brazil, Belgium,Finland, Poland, Yugoslavia, Turkey, S.C.A.P. (Japan), Mexico, the Eussian-Zone of Germany and Iceland. There follow notes on the principal negotiations with have been concluded or are in an advanced state.India and Pakistan18. Agreement has been reached with both India and Pakistan whichextends the August 1947 Agreement until 30th June, 1948. Our main object wasto ensure that India&apos;s drawings on the central gold and dollar reserves shouldnot in fact exceed whatever amount might be agreed, and various methods of doing this were discussed. In the result we have accepted arrangements whichwill give us earlier information of the actual drawings (and receipts) and providefor immediate consultation if they appear to be running away.19. Of the  20 million agreed as the estimate of India&apos;s net hard currencyrequirements in the first six months of 1948, we have agreed to provide  10 million,but this includes (a)  1 million overdrawn by Indian banks in 1947, (b) a corn-position for the balance of the Post-War Dollar Fund, to which India was entitled.Any excess over the estimate will be met by India, drawing as necessary on theInternational Monetary Fund, and she will also draw (if there is no excess) froman additional  3 million as a &quot;cushion.&quot; We have agreed to India&apos;s drawingdown  18 million sterling from her balances during the period. India will relaxher restrictions on the import of certain classes of United Kingdom exports ineasy supply. Pakistan has agreed to limit her drawings on the central gold and dollar reserves to  3-3 million in the first half of 1948, and to a release of 6 million from the sterling balances in the period additional to the sum of about 4 million carried forward for the 1947 release. Pakistan has also been allowed a working balance of  10 million sterling, India being allowed to retain the whole 20 million provided in August.
Denmark20. Negotiations have been concluded and an agreement announced. since we could not give them a dollar ration, the Danes reduced their offer of butterto 40,000 tons, the price remaining at 321/6d. per cwt. In addition, we obtained22,000 tons of bacon at 225/-d. per cwt. and various other useful food-stuffs. Inreturn we supply, inter alia, 870,000 tons of coal and 50,000 tons of steel.Finland21. &quot;We have reached agreement except on timber prices. We should get190,000 tons of chemical pulp, 125,000 standards of softwood and useful quantitiesof other timber products. In return, we are proposing to supply 500,000 tons ofcoal (including a small quantity of coke) and 55,000 tons of steel in the year ending31st March, 1949. The Finns are not asking for dollars this year. In 1947 weprovided them with $25 million.Poland22. The general lines of a trade agreement with Poland are almost settled.We shall receive food-stuffs to the value of between  7i million to  8  million in1948, including useful quantities of bacon, eggs, poultry and fruit pulp. Wemay also receive some timber. In return we are assisting them to obtain acommercial credit of  6 million so that they may place contracts for capital goods over the next eighteen months. The Poles are also planning to buy 20 million of other goods and we have agreed to facilitate supplies of tinplate,sisal, crude oil, rubber and copper, the latter in exchange for lead and zinc.We are not giving them dollars.YIII.- PricesRetail prices23. The interim index of retail prices was unchanged in January at 104(17th June, 1947 = 100).Prices in the United States24. The recent sharp fall in commodity prices in the United States was arrested on 14th February and prices have increased slightly since then. Moody&apos;sindex of staple commodity prices (31st December, 1931 = 100) was 413 on 1st Marchcompared with 441 a month before and 418 a year ago. March wheat futures atChicago were quoted at $2-53 a bushel on 1st March compared with $3-13 abushel on 12th January.IX. Wage Rates25. The overall index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100) remained unchanged in January at 104. The indices for both men and for women showed a rise of 4 per cent, since June 1947 but rates for juveniles have risen by per cent. Increases in wage rates in cotton spinning and manufacturing and in wool and silk manufacture raised the index for textiles from 101 inDecember to 103 in January and the index for clothing from 100 to 102.
