(THIS DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)76SECRET COPY NOC.P.(h8) 7U9th March,  19hS.CABINETPAY OF SENIOR POLICE OFFICERSMemorandum by the Home secretary in January, 19h7j I set up a committee, consisting of equal numbers of Chief Constables and representatives of thelocal police authorities, together&apos; with re-presontatives of theHome Office, to consider and submit proposals for the rational-isation and reduction of the present unduly high number of scales of pay for Chief Constables in the light of their present-dayresponsibilities,  duties and conditions.      The Committee, whichwas in effect a negotiating &quot;body,  submitted to me in July, 191+7*a unanimous Report providing for now and increased scales of pay for Chief Constables and Assistant Chief Constables.2. I was &apos;given to understand after the Report had beensubmitted that the representatives of the Local authority associations on the Committee who had taken port in thenegotiations and had signed the Report had no authority to committheir parent bodies;    and after consultation with the treasury referred the Report to the County Councils Association and theAssociation of Municipal Corporations on 11th July,  19h7, with an intimation that I was prepared to accept the recommendations modein it and proposed to ask police authorities to give effect tothem.      The Association of Municipal Corporations informed me inOctober last that they accepted the proposed scales;    the poli^^Committee of the County Councils Association also accepted thembut on 29th January last I was informed that the Executive Councilof the Association hud, by 21 votes to 18, decided to refer theReport back to the Police Committee.3* A similar negotiating committee was set up in december last to consider the pay of police Superintendents;    the reason why it was not set up at on earlier date was that the LocalAuthority Associations had failed to reach any conclusions ona Report dealing with the organisation and responsibilities of the senior ranks in the police service which had been referred tothem in the middle of last year.      This Committee has not yetformally submitted its Report, but agreement on scales of pay forSuperintendents was reached on 3rd February, 19h-8, i.e. before theissue of the White Paper on Personal Incomes (Gmd. 7321).h. I regard it as essential, as a matter of good faith;,  that effect should now be given to both of these - agreements.      In the -case of the Chief Constables and Assistant Chief Constables,  thewhole issue would hove been disposed of in the middle of last yearbut for the unconscionable delay of the Local authority associations;    it would also&apos; have been possible to have appointed the Committee on Superintendents&apos; Pay, as I undertook to do morethan a year ago,  and.to have disposed of their claim also long before the end of last year but for the failure of the LocalAuthority Associations to deal with certain questions of grading-1-
and organisation which ought to have &quot;been settled as a preliminary to the wage negotiations proper.      If now the legitimate claims of the officers of these ranks, embodied inagreed Reports setting out the results of free negotiation between both sidesi were to be rejected by the Government theeffect upon the police service would be deplorable.      It wouldwithout doubt shake the confidence of the police in the valueof collective bargaining and would inevitably result in a feeling among the senior officers of the police service thatthey cannot trust the Secretary of state in matters of thiskind.      My view of the position is that public faith has beenpledged and that the pledge must be honoured.5. The police forces are dealing with an unprecedentlygrim situation in the discharge of their duties.      Most of the mare seriously undermanned.      They have, nevertheless, dischargedtheir duties with exemplary diligence^     To allow a minority of authorities by dilatory tactics to -destroy the results of collective bargaining for those who carry the heaviestresponsibilities Would make a mockery of the tributes which one has been compelled to pay to the leaders of these forces.6. I, therefore, most earnestly ask my colleagues to agreethat.I may refer both agreements to individual police authoritiesand ask them to submit revised scales of pay in accordance with*the agreements.      I have reason to believe that practically all local authorities will be ready and anxious to adopt the revisedscales and that if any local authority is recalcitrant it willnot have the sympathy of the other authorities.      If any&apos;individual authorities refuse to honour the agreements, I would propose to compel them .to do so under the powers conferred onme by the Police Act, 1919.Home Office^ S.W. 1.9th March,  I9I4.8.

To the Rt. Hon. J. Chuter Ede, m.p.H.M. Secretary of State for the Home Department.Sir,1. We were appointed on 21st January, 1947, to consider, and to submit proposals for, the rationalization and reduction of the present unduly largenumber of scales of pay for Chief Constables in England and Wales in thelight of their present day responsibilities, duties and conditions, including the changes that wdl be effected in pursuance of the Police Act, 1946. We have held three meetings and we have the honour to present to you this report ofour conclusions. You will see that we have considered it to be within our terms of reference to consider the scales of pay for Assistant Chief Constablessince they are so closely linked with our main subject.Introduction2. It will be convenient if we begin by setting out briefly a historicalaccount of the subject. Before 1919 the pay of Chief Constables was notgoverned by any uniform principle, and the Desborough Committee foundwide differences between the remuneration of Chief Constables whose responsi-bilities as far as could be judged were ver3- similar. The DesboroughCommittee considered that the salaries of Chief Constables required revisionno less than those of other ranks in the police service. They considered thatit was not possible to fix the salaries of Chief Constables of Borough forcesmerely on a basis of the strength of the force and/or the population of thepolice district, and that to fix the salaries of County Chief Constables onany such hard-and-fast rule would be even less appropriate. They did,however, think it was possible to lay down certain minimum limits, and they recommended that the pay of Chief Constables on appointment in Boroughforces should not be lower than the general level indicated in the followingtable : Strength of Population of the Minimum rate ofthe force police district pay on appointment60 70 50,000  500125-150 100,000  600225 275 180,000 .                  750400 450 275,000  900with a rent allowance if a house was not provided. The Committee also recommended that the pay should rise by fixed increments according to lengthof service in the rank.3. The Secretary of State accepted these recommendations and invitedeach police authority to submit for his approval a scale of pay for the postReport of theCommittee on Chief Constables&apos; Pay
of Chief Constable based on the following principles which he put forward asa guide : (a) The minimum should be determined in accordance with the table forBorough Chief Constables quoted above, County Chief Constables tohave no less than the figure indicated for a Borough force of corres-ponding size.(b) The difference between the minimum and the maximum should beabout one-quarter or one-third of the former.(c) The maximum should be reached after 8 to 10 years&apos; service as chief constable i.e., tlie scale should rise by four or five biennial incrementsor three triennial increments.The initiative in fixing scales was left to the individual police authorities,and the Secretary of State was concerned mainly to secure that the scalesthat were adopted reflected the responsibilities, of the various Chief Con-stables&apos; posts and could stand comparison with one another from that pointof view. One result of this approach, however, was that a comparatively largenumber of scales was approved.4. Although there was no general review of Chief Constables&apos; pay until1938, a large proportion of the scales that were fixed in 1920 were subsequentlyreviewed individually at the request of particular police authorities, many ofwhom were able to show that the responsibilities of their Chief Constable had altered and that in consequence the post justified a different scale of pay.This gave rise to a steady upward trend in Chief Constables&apos; scales of pay inthe period of 18 years after 1920. The cumulative effect of this piecemealrevision was considerable, as may be judged from the fact that when theHome Office looked into the matter in 1937, it was found that no fewer than106 out of 178 scales had been revised between the years 1930 and 1937 alone.5. In 1938, it was represented on behalf of Chief Constables that the time had come for a complete review of Chief Constables&apos; scales of pay on thegrounds :  . .(a) that there bad been a general increase in their responsibilities sincethe settlement in 1920 ;(b) that, during the same period, material improvements in the pay ofLocal Government Officials had left Chief Constables comparativelyworse off; and(c) that an improvement during 1937 in the pay of Superintendents hadupset the relationship between Chief Constables&apos; scales and those ofthe subordinate ranks.These representations weie considered by the Home Office in consultationwith the County Councils&apos; Association and the Association of municipal corporations, and the Secretary of State accepted a suggestion made by thetwo Associations that there should be a general, increase by 10 per cent, in theexisting scales, combined with an adjustment in any scales wftich, as a resultof the piecemeal alterations mentioned in paragraph 4, had fallen out ofalignment with those fixed for posts of comparable responsibility. new scales fixed in accordance with this decision were recommended to police authorities and, in the end, were all adopted, though there was a delay of asmuch as two or three years by a few police authorities.   .6. During the 1939-1945 war, members of the police service were given an addition to their emoluments of the same amount as the &quot; war bonus &quot; grantedto civil servants. To begin with, it was confined to the lower ranks and was&apos;-
known as a &quot;supplementary allowance,&quot; i.e., a&apos;non-pensionable addition toemoluments. This allowance was increased in amount from time to time tomeet the changing conditions brought about by the war: its award wasprogressively extended to higher paid members, of the service : and it was finally made a pensionable &quot; war supplement &quot; to pay. Chief Constables firstbecame entitled to this additional emolument on the 1st June, 1942, when itsaward was confined to those whose rate of pay at the time (including rent allowance or the value of a provided house) was  500 a year. By the beginningof March, 1945, when police pay as a whole was again reviewed, the &quot;war^supplement &quot; was  60 a year and the upper limit for its award had been increased to  1,500 a year. With effect from the 1st April, 1945, the &quot; warsupplement &quot; was consolidated with pay, which was increased at the same time.As it affected Chief Constables, this review brought about an increase in eachscale of 10 per cent, of its minimum, together with the consolidation of thewhole amount of the war supplement where it was due. New scales assessed,on this basis were ultimately adopted by all police authorities.7. In 1946, police pay was again reviewed, the increase taking effect from the 6th November of that year. As part of that review, you have recommended, with the concurrence of the County Councils&apos;Association and the Association of Municipal Corporations, that chief constables&apos; scales should be increased by sums ranging between  50 and  60and that the increments should be so fixed that the maximum is reached inall cases after 5 years&apos; service instead of S, 9 or 10 years. The latter change,which marks a departure from the principles put forward by the Secretaryof State in 1920, was made in deference to the views of the representatives of chief Constables who argued that, by comparison with conditions in other occupations, 8 to 10 years was an unduly long period for a man to wait for themaximum of his scale of pay after reaching the highest rank in his profession.The scales suggested to police authorities are set out in col. (3) of Appendix I.At the time of our deliberations, some had been adopted by police authoritiesand the others were still under consideration.8. Since each general review provided for an increase on the basis of the scales then in force, the wide diversity of scales adopted in 1920 has not beenmaterially affected. To quote in detail the evolution of the scales for theChief Constables of all forces would serve no useful purpose, but it may be ofinterest to trace the changes in a few representative examples : Force191419Z0193719391944(approxi-mate)19451947frecom-mended)LancashireBirminghamManchesterGlamorganLeedsDerbyshireNewcastle-on-TyneSwanseaCoventry ...Reading   ...1,0001,1001,250900800800500.  550500f500-600(4)1,500-2,000(8)   .1,350-1,750(8)1,350-1,750*(8)1,4001,100-1,400&apos;   (9)900-1,150(10)900-1,150(10)675-  900(10)625- 800(10)600-  750(9)no change1,500-2,000(8)1,500-2,000(8)1,100-1,400(9)no change no change1,000-1,300(9)700-  900(8)750-1,000(10)600-  800(8)I1,700-2(8)1,700-2(8)1,700-2(8)1,200-1(9)1,250-1(9)1,000-1(9)1,100-1(9)800-1(8)900-1(8)700-_(8)200,200200500550,300,400,000,200900no change no change no change1,260-1,500(9)1,310-1,500(9)1,060-1,360(9)1,160-1,460(9)860-1,060(8)960-1,260(8)760-  960(8)1,850-2,350(8)1,850-2,350(8)1,850-2,350(8)1,375-1,675(9)1,400-1,7001,160-1,460(9)1,270-1,570(9)940-1,140(8)1,050-1,350(8)830-1,030(8)1,900-2,4(10(5)1,900-2,400(5)1,900-2,400(5)1,425-1,725(5)1,450-1,750(5)1,210-1,510(5)1,320-1,620(5)1,000-1,200(5)1,100-1,400(5)880-1,080(5)* Plus at Plus a personal, non-pensionable allowance of  250 to the then Chief Constable,non-pensionable allowance of  50.
9. The pay of Assistant Chief Constables has always been closely related to that of Chief Constables, and most of what has been said in the preceding paragraphs of this note applies equally to Assistant Chief Constables&apos; scales.The rank is now approved in considerably more forces, however, thanoriginally.Comparative Criteria for scales of pay10. We have taken as the starting point of our study three principles which are, we think, sufficiently self-evident to need no argument in their support: (a) The scale of pay for any Chief Constable should be based solely on thepolice responsibilities arising out of his post;(b) the scale should be related to the post and should not depend in anyway upon the merits of any particular holder ; and(c) Chief Constables&apos; posts of comparable police responsibilities shouldhave comparable scales of pay.With these principles in mind, we have cast around for criteria whichwould enable us to measure the police responsibilities of various chief constables&apos; posts against each other with sufficient accuracy to warrant their use in fixing scales of pay. We discuss various possibilities in succeedingparagraphs.11. The Desborough Committee&apos;s conclusions on the subject are containedin paragraph 54 of their report, which reads as follows : -&quot; We do not think it possible to fix the salaries of Chief Constables,even Chief Constables of the Borough forces, merely on a basis of strengthof forces and/or population, partly because of the considerable variations in the strength of the forces in towns of about the same size, and to fix the salaries of County Chief Constables on any such hard-and-fast rule would be even less appropriate.&quot;We understand that your Department has always subscribed to this view in assessing the responsibilities of Chief Constables&apos; posts, and hence in determining the appropriate scales of pay. The Department recognised thatestablishment was probably the most material single factor to be taken intoaccount, but gave full weight to the views of police authorities as to theexistence of any special circumstances which might tend to differentiate the responsibilities of particular Chief Constables&apos; posts from those of others inforces with comparable establishments. For this purpose, the Home Office&apos;was prepared to take into account, in a general way, arguments based on such factors as the size of the population of the police district, the characteristics of the police district and its population as judged by its record of crimes anddisorders, the area of the police district and the mileage of streets and roads.For historical reasons (see paragraphs 2 to 8) a comparatively large numberof scales has been approved in the past. These may reflect, perhaps, attempts at a more accurate assessment of responsibilities than is advisable or evenpossible ; but, more probably, they are the result of deferring to the greatest possible extent to the views of the individual police authorities who, as thePolice Regulations stand, are primarily responsible for fixing the scales of pay for Chief Constables.12. If the present diversity of scales is to be reduced to reasonable pro-portions, we are convinced that some simpler basis than this must be adopted&quot;and, despite the Desborough Committee&apos;s views on the subject, we have
sought to find a single criterion for the purpose. Criminal statistics wouldreflect only one aspect of: police work, and population, by itself, would beunreliable since, to quote an obvious example, a sea-port with a high pro-portion of visiting foreign seamen is likely to give rise to more serious crimeand more police responsibility than an inland town of the same size where thepopulation is stable. : In the authorised establishment of the force, however,we think we have found a criterion that will serve the purpose. We realise that its use is open to objections. The number of men necessary to maintainefficient policing in a particular district is, within certain limits, a matter of^opinion. Different police authorities have different views about the scale ofpolicing desirable for their districts, and we understand that the HomeOffice policy in the past, when authorising police establishments, has been toallow police authorities as wide a discretion as possible. At the present time,therefore, the nature of police problems arising in&apos; police forces and the responsibilities of Chief Constables&apos; posts may not in all cases be closelyreflected in authorised establishments; and could not be unless your controlwere actively and even rigidly exercised to remove local idiosyncrasies. Butwe know that most police authorities have recently reviewed, or are at presentin process of reviewing, police establishments in the light of post-war needs:we are assured that your Department, in consultation with H&apos;&apos;s Majesty&apos;sInspectors, the. Chief Constables and the police authorities concerned,, givesclose consideration to all relevant factors affecting police responsibilitiesbefore each establishment is finally fixed: and we believe that, in the end,this process will result in a sufficient degree of consistency for the authorisedestablishment of a force to be used as an index of the responsibilities of theChief Constable&apos;s post. We recommend, therefore, that the number of policemen and women authorised in each force should be the sole factor determiningwhich scale of pay in a given range should be attached to the Chief Constable&apos;spost. For this purpose&quot; additional constables &quot; (i.e., those whose cost doesnot fall upon the Police Fund and whose numbers are not included in the authorised establishment of the force) should be aggregated with the authorised establishment; and if any Chief Constable receives from an outsidesource a separate salary for taking charge of &quot;additional constables,&quot; hisscale of pay from the Police Fund should be assessed on the basis of the totalnumber of constables (including additional constables) supervised, and hissubsidiary salary should be brought to the credit of the Police Fund.,13. For the sake of completeness, we would like to mention a topic thathas; been raised more than once in the past. It has been argued from time totime by certain police authorities or Chief Constables, and by the Associationsrepresenting Chief Constables, that the post of Chief Constable in any force should have a scale of pay approximately level with the salary of the seniorlocal authority officials. The comparison is a natural one for a police authority or a Chief Constable to make, but there is no consistency among the salaries of comparable local officials, and it would not be possible to fix Chief Constables&apos;scales in relation to the salaries of any particular local authority officials inany particular . district without offending -against the general principle,mentioned in paragraph 10 above, that Chief Constables&apos; posts of comparableresponsibilities should have comparable scales of pay.Subsidiary Emoluments14. Regulation 73 of the Police Regulations permits members of police forces to receive payments for the performance of certain extraneous duties,and we find that a number of Chief Constables receive allowances, sometimesof substantial amounts, for the supervision of work in connection with Local
Taxation, the Diseases of Animals Acts, inspection of weights and measures,etc.. In our view, the fact that a Chief Constable is appointed on the under-standing that he will devote his-whole time to the duties of his post makes itdifficult to justify the accretion of -extraneous duties which are not withinthe ambit of police work proper. If new scales of pay are to be fixed for chief constables they can only be on the basis of the police duties performed, andwe recommend, therefore, that with the exception of Local Taxation work,Chief Constables should, as from the date of the introduction of any new scales which may result from our recommendations, be relieved of all responsi-bility for the extraneous duties which they have been undertaking apartfrom those performed in pursuance of a specific statutory requirement (e.g.,Diseases of Animals Acts, Explosives Act and Petroleum Acts) ; and thatemoluments for all such extraneous duties should be discontinued from thesame date.Local Taxation duties fall into two categories : the actual issue of exciselicences, and the inspection of vehicles, etc., for the enforcement of theregulations. It seems to us right that the police should continue to carry outthe latter class of duty, but we do not think the Chief Constable should receive any extra emoluments on this account. As regards the former class of duty,we are unanimous in thinking that it is not a proper function for a chief constable. We think that where the work is now being done by the chief constable the responsibility should be transferred to the local authority atthe earliest possible moment. Until the transfer of responsibility is effected,however, a Chief Constable who is performing the work should continue toreceive his present emoluments for it.Number of Scales15. As we have pointed out earlier in this report, there is at present a widediversity of scales&quot; for Chief Constables&apos; posts, and in considering to whatdegree this diversity should be reduced, we have borne in mind the benefitsthat accrue to the police service as a whole from the present tendency of chief constables to seek, from time to time, a transfer to larger commands. Eachchange of command brings to the force a fresh outlook on day-to-day problems and helps to counteract any tendency to stagnation which might arise withtoo great continuity of command. We think, therefore, that the number ofscales should not be so far reduced as to remove a reasonable degree ofincentive for Chief Constables to transfer to larger commands, and werecommend, as a reasonable compromise, the introduction of not less thannine different scales of pay.Pay-groups16. Taking the total establishment of the force as our criterion (in accord-ance with the views recorded in paragraph 12 above) we have classified the posts of Chief Constable in England and Wales into the following nine groups : Establishment of Force Number of posts affected(a) Less than 75 strong ...       ......       ...   ( 9 posts)(b) Between 75 and   125 strong......   (24    ,,   )(c) ,, 126 ,, 200 ,, ...... (28 ,, )(d) ,, 201 ,, 300 ,, ...... (16 ,, )(e) ,, 301 ,, 400 ,, ...... (14 ,, )(/) ,, 401 ,, 600 ,, ...... (17 ,, )(g) ,, 601 ,, 800 ,, ...... ( 8 ,, )(A) ,, 801 ,, 1,200 ...... ( 5 ,, )(i) Over 1,200 strong   ...      ... ...... (6 ,, )and we recommend that a standard scale of pay should be fixed for each of
the groups (a) to (/?). The posts are listed in full according to their pay-groups in Appendix I (on the basis of existing establishments).&quot; Margin of Toleration &quot;17. We have considered whether the classification into pay-groups oughtto be subject to the qualification that any small increase or decrease inestablishment bringing the force into the pay-group immediately above orbelow should not necessarily involve an increase or decrease in the scale ofif&apos; pay for its Chief Constable. We have come to the conclusion, however, thatany such &quot;margin of toleration&quot; would be inconsistent with our recom-mendation that the establishment of the&apos; force should be the sole criterion for determing which of a given series of scales should apply to each post of chief Constable, and we decided not to recommend its adoption. We agree,however, that when a decrease in the establishment of a force takes place and the Chief Constables post falls into a lower pay-group, the Chiel Constablethen in office should not suffer financially, the necessary adjustment in thescale ot pay being left until the post next becomes vacant.Scales of Pay18. We have considered whether it would be possible to assess the amounts of the scales of pay for each of the pay-groups by reference to the emolumentsof men in other professions, but we have come to the conclusion that there isno other occupation with which comparisons could usefully be made. Wethink, however, that under present conditions the pay of a Chief Constablein charge of a force of 100 should be in the region of  1,000 a year, and fromthis general conclusion we have derived the following scales of pay which werecommend for adoption : Pay-group Scale(a) Force Establishment under  75    ......  750- 50-  1,000(6)                   ,,              75-125    ......  950- 50- l,200(c) -    ,,           ,,              126-200    ......  l,100- 50- l,350(d) ,, ,,              201-300    ......  l,250- 50- i,500(e) ,, ,,              301-400    .......  1,350- 50- 1,600(/) ,, ,,             401-600    ......  l,450- 60- l,750(g) ,, ,,              601-800    ......  1,550- 70- 1,900\h) ,, ,,             801-1,200 ......  l,750- 70- 2,100Appendix 1 shows the forces to which these scales would apply.In putting these scales forward, we have taken into account the fact thata Chief Constable receives a free house or a rent allowance free of income tax ;and we link our recommendation of these scales with the recommendation inparagraph 14 above that certain subsidiary emoluments should be given up.It will be observed that we do not recommend specific scales for the posts(at present six in number) in the group of forces over 1,200 strong. Theirestablishments vary greatly in size, and we are satisfied that more than onescale will have to be fixed within this group. We think that, on a comparisonwith the other scales, the lowest should be in the region of  1,900  80  2,300 ;but we feel that &quot;the best course would be to leave the actual amounts to besettled, by consultation between the police authorities concerned and yourDepartment, on the general basis recommended in this Report.Assistant Chief Constables19. We recommend new scales of pay for Assistant chief Constables inforces between 401 and 1,200 strong, on the basis of the same pay-groupsas for Chief Constables, and assessed at roughly two-thirds of the amounts&apos;)
put forward for Chief Constables. They are set out in full in Appendix II.We think that the scales for Assistant Chief Constables in forces more than,200 strong should, like those of the Chief Constables in that group, be left for individual settlement between your Department and the police authorities concerned, and we think the scales should be equivalent to between 60 percent, and two-thirds of those that are fixed for Chief Constables in this group.In forces over 1,200 strong, the establishment normally provides for twoAssistant Chief Constables, and we recommend that the senior assistant chief Constables in these forces should have a pensionable addition to pay of the order of  100 a year in recognition of the added responsibilities which arise out of their having to perform the functions of Deputy Chief Constable.Changes arising out of the Police Act, 194620. One effect of the mergers carried out in pursuance of the Police Act,1946, has been that, as from 1st April, 1947, the establishments of certaincounty forces (and the responsibilities of the Chief Constables) have been considerably increased. We have discussed three possible methods of recognisingthese increased responsibilities, namely : (a) that the scales of pay of the Chief Constables concerned might beincreased, as from 1st April, on the basis on which Chief Constables&apos;scales have hitherto been fixed ; and the new scales that we recommendin this report should apply to Chief Constables generally at a later date ;(b) that the new scales recommended in this report might apply, as from 1st April, only to the Chief Constables affected by the mergers, and toother Chief Constables at a later date ; and(c) that the new scales that we recommepd for Chief Constables mightapply to all alike afe from the 1st April.The second of these courses would be unfair to the majority of Chief Con-stables, and the choice seems to us, therefore, to lie between the first and thethird. Of these, we think that the balance of advantage lies with the third,and we accordingly recommend that the scales we put forward in this report should come into effect from 1st April. In arriving at this view, we have been influenced by the facts that you appointed us to go into the subject as long ago as the 21st January, and that we had already reached substantial agree-ment before the 1st April on the scales that we suggest in this report.Summary of Recommendations21. Our main recommendations may be summarised as follows : (rt) The total establishment of the force (including policewomen and&quot; additional constables &quot;), should be the sole criterion for assessing the Chief Constable&apos;s responsibilities, and hence in deciding whichscale of pay in a given range should apply to him.(b) Your Department should exercise such control as may be necessary toensure that there is a reasonable degree of consistency in the authorisedestablishments of the different police forces.(c) All Chief Constables should have increased scales of pay. New scales of pay for eight different pay-groups in forces up to 1,200 strong are recommended for adoption. New scales, assessed on a similar basis,should be fixed individually by the police authorities of forces morethan 1,200 strong, in consultation with your Department.
(d) Assistant Chief Constables should have increased scales of pay. new scales are suggested for Assistant Chief Constables in forces between401 and 1,200 strong, based on the same pay-groups as, and assessed........at approximately two-thirds of, the corresponding, scales for chief constables. New scales, assessed at between 60 per cent, and two-thirds of the Chief Constables&apos; scales, should be fixed individually forthe Assistant Chief Constables in forces more than 1,200 strong by thepolice authorities concerned in consultation with your Department.The senior assistant Chief Constables in this group of forces shouldhave a pensionable addition to pay of the order of  100 a year.(e) As from the date of the adoption of the new scales, Chief Constablesand Assistant Chief Constables should be relieved of all responsibilityfor extraneous duties which they have been undertaking, apart fromthose performed in pursuance of a specific statutory requirement; andthese should cease to attract any separate emoluments. We make atemporary exception in favour of certain forms of Local Taxation work.(/) The new scales should be introduced with effect from the 1st April,1947. If this is done, no further steps need be taken to recognise theincreased responsibilities falling upon certain Chief Constables andAssistant Chief Constables as a result of the mergers made in pursuanceof the Police Act, 1946.22. We would wish to make particular reference to the great assistance which has been given to us throughout our deliberations by Mr. R. J. Whittick,of the Home Office, the Secretary of the Committee. Both in preparinghistorical and other matter for our consideration and in drafting our report,his detailed knowledge and assistance have been invaluable to us.We have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed) F.
