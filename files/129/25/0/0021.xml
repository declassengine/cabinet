132[ilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET ^C.P.(U8)  8111TH MARCH,  19U.8CABINETPAY OF SENIOR POLICE OFFICERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i have considered the proposals about the pay of senior police officers which are made in the Home Secretary&apos;smemorandum of 9th March (CP. (U8) 7k) *    I fully appreciate the arguments which the Home Secretary uses in favour of theseproposals as they relate to police forces in England andWales, but there are certain considerations, including sonicrelating specially to Scotland, which I wish to bring to thenotice of my colleagues.2. ...   The proposals of the English Committee on the pay of Chief Constables and Assistant Chief Constables were submitted to the three Associations of local authorities inScotland and have been rejected;    and as the Home Secretarypoints out they havo not been accepted by the Association ofCounty Councils in England.   This means that unless ScottishChief Constables and Assistant Chief Constables arc to &quot;be paidless than their opposite numbers in England, which would boa departure from all precedent and would cause tho gravestdiscontent, I should have to force acceptance of the now scalesupon Scottish police authorities by means of Police Regulations.The difficulty of doing this in face of tho White paper. requires no emphasis.3, The recommendations of the English Committee on the pay of Superintendents, which were made only on 3rd February,have not yet been submitted to the local authority associations,as would have to be done before they could be given effect inScotland, oven if the Home Secretary does not regard it asnocessary to do so in England and Wales.    I have little doubtthat tho authorities would oppose tho recommendations by reference to the White Paper, but the Scottish SuperintendentsCould of course insist that they should be treated as well astho English, and I should be in much the same position as inthe case of Chief Constables and Assistant Chief Constables.k* I am much concerned also about the generalrepercussions of the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals.    I am already under considerable pressure for increases of pay from thePolice Federation, which so far I have resisted on the grounds of the economic position.    A further substantial increase of pay to senior officers will make almost irresistible the demands-1-
cf the lower ranks of the police sorvico, -which in turn wouldho taken up by the fire service and possibly by localauthority services generally.   Any such v/idosproad increasesmay woll have other repercussions outside these services andbe- gravely detrimental to the Government1s policy on personal incomes,  costs and priceso53 Both the Home Secretary and I are being strongly pressed by the Police Federations to proceed now, instead of waiting until 1949? with the appointment, to which theGovernment are pledged, of an independent and impartialcommittee on police pay and conditions 1 cf service.    If this claim is conceded (and I think it should be) I should much prefer that the senior ranks should,  on patriotic grounds and. in the interests of good fooling&apos; in their own forces,be persuaded to allow their claims to stand the same scrutinyby the Independent Committee as the pay claims of constables,sergeants and inspectors.    Indeed I feel that, on balance,this course would be more in the long term intorests ofpolice efficiency and contentment.A.W.Scottish Office, S.W.I.,11th March, 19^+8*
