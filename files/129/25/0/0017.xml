(48) 775th March, 1948CABINETSERVICE ACCOMMODATION IN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Minister of defence i circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues memoranda bythe Service Ministers on the subject of accommodation in the United Kingdom.2. The outlook they report is a melancholy one. Though the reasons are different in the case of each individual Service, the position in all three is that only a minority of the men and women now serving can be considered to beeven tolerably housed. All three Services are suffering from the necessity tocontinue using hutted accommodation hurriedly constructed during the war tominimum austerity standards and now rapidly deteriorating. The Army andthe Royal Navy are also compelled to continue using antiquated barrack accom-modation, some of which needs to be entirely rebuilt, while the remainder, thoughstructurally sound, will have to be entirely gutted to bring it up to reasonablepresent-day standards. The worst examples of this type are perhaps the Armyaccommodation at Aldershot, and the naval barracks at the three Home Ports,though there are many other places in which the situation is equally bad.3. There is also a serious shortage of married quarters in all three Services.Even on pre-war entitlement scales, it will take the Army and the Royal AirForce at present rates of progress something between ten and fifteen years tocomplete their programmes. The Royal Navy, which has never had married quarters in the past, is making a beginning by providing them at isolated establish-ments such as air stations, and is hoping to complete its very modest programmeof some 5,000 houses within four years.4. My colleagues will appreciate that the generally poor state of barrackaccommodation and the serious lack of married quarters are most powerfuldeterrents to that -general increase in the rate of regular recruiting on whichwe are counting to build up and reorganise our peace-time armed forces.5. There is an urgent problem in the provision of accommodation forterritorial and auxiliary forces. Though it is most acute in the case of theArmy, which will require to spend no less than  13 million a year for five years in order that the Territorial Army may be ready to receive the National Servicereservists from 1st January, 1950, onwards, the other two Services have similar problems, which must be tackled soon if their reserves are to be built up at anadequate rate. At present, recruiting for the reserve and auxiliary forces is extremely slow, and it cannot be doubted that the lack of suitable accommodation is one of the main reasons for this situation.6. The Service Ministers and I fully accept that in our present circum-stances large building programmes for the Services are out of the question. Wedo, however, feel that the Cabinet should be aware of the situation and thatit should realise that the cuts in the housing programme and the general reductionof capital investment are having a serious effect upon the Services. The workslabour strength allocated to the Services by the White Paper on Capital Invest-ment in 1948 (Cmd. 7268) is not really adequate even for essential maintenance,apart from large-scale measures of rehabilitation or new construction.35034b
. 7. In that White Paper it was stated that &apos;&apos; The Government attach great importance to meeting the requirements of the Services for housing as a major factor in maintaining morale and in stimulating regular recruiting. TheService housing programme must be considered in relation to the general programme of housing construction, but it is the policy of the Government togive favourable consideration to it, though in some areas it will, if a conflict of priority arises, have to take second place to houses for miners and farm workers;&quot;8. The Minister of Health has, I know, been giving most sympathetic consideration to the needs of the Services. Now that it has been decided (CM. (48)16th Conclusions, Minute 4) that the housing programme is to be increased, I trust that it will be possible to allocate to the Services a substantial share of this increase. Such action would, I know, have a great effect not only on the morale of men and women already in the Services, but also on regular recruiting.9. I also observe from the memorandum recently circulated by theChancellor of the Exchequer on the housing programme (CP. (48) 56) that there isa risk of considerable unemployment in the building industry. I would urge thatwherever such a situation arises and the surplus labour can be employed on workof any kind for the Service Departments, whether maintenance or new construc-tion, it should be so employed, even though this might mean that the labourceilings at present authorised are temporarily exceeded. It will in any case benecessary to press for a considerable increase in the labour allocations of theService Departments when the time comes to settle the level of capital investment in 1949.A. V. A.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,5th March, 1948.IACCOMMODATION  FOR THE NAVY,  MARINES  AND  reserve forces IN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty am deeply concerned over our present inability to implement promises,made in Parliament, that accommodation for both married and single personnelshall be brought up to a reasonable standard.2. Accommodation for naval personnel on shore in the United Kingdom is,by reason of their duties, concentrated largely in and around the dockyard ports of Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth. Until the beginning of this century,naval personnel were housed in ships and hulks afloat in the naval ports. Withthe construction of naval barracks on shore at Chatham (1901), Portsmouth (1903)and Plymouth (1885-1901), however, few shore-based naval ratings are now housedafloat. Other similar establishments of importance are the Gunnery School.H.M.S. Excellent, which, though built about 1900, consists largely of utilitarianbuildings, and the Torpedo School, H.M.S. Vernon, housed in a former Armyestablishment in which the accommodation of the ratings was provided byadaptation of old War Department storehouse buildings.3. Of the Marine barracks, those at Deal, Chatham and Plymouth are ofancient construction, dating from Napoleonic days, while the Marine barracksat Portsmouth were built in 1863. Few measures of modernisation have beencarried out in any of these Marine barracks.4. Eminent consulting architects have reported to the Admiralty and advisedon the best means, where feasible, of modernising the barracks, to provide areasonable degree of comfort for the Navy and Marines on shore. Their reports indicate that complete rebuilding of the Marine barracks at Chatham andPlymouth will be necssary in order to achieve the required standard, while at theother barracks nothing less than incorporation of extensive measures of modefnisa-tion will remove most bf the defects. These defects arise primarily from veryinadequate standards of ventilation, heating and cooking equipment, from the lack of proper sanitary, bathing and washing facilities, overcrowding and fromthe need to provide conditions of greater privacy than those which now obtainin the large dormitories. : :
5. Accommodation in hutted camps ranges from the few reasonably satisfactory camps of the militia type to the austerely erected Nissen campsconstructed during the war at some of the remote Naval Air Stations, many ofwhich are in a very bad state of repair. Replacement of the latter is an urgent necessity. The Admiralty are faced, too, with the problem of providing suitable accommodation for a permanent service of 7,500 W.R.N.S. because there is nonaval accommodation previously used by men which can be adapted for the purpose.6. These commitments will involve very heavy expenditure, clearly in excessof  10,000,000. It has, however, been practicable to make financial provision ofa, sum of only  80,000 in the forthcoming Navy Estimates for the start of someof the most urgent items of modernisation.7. As regards naval married quarters, it is pertinent to recall that anaccompaniment of the new pay code was the expressed intention to achieve broadequality in conditions of service as between the three Services. The other services have had married quarters for years, whereas the provision of such quarters isan entirely new commitment for the Navy. The Admiralty is consequently ata grave disadvantage in this connection and it is a cause of great disappointmentand impatience in the Naval Service. We were on the point of embarking uponconstruction of married quarters when it became necessary to review our programme in relation to the curtailed national housing programme. Apart froma certain amount of conversion of existing buildings into a limited number of married quarters, all that we have been able to do so far is to make a smallbeginning, of about 100 quarters only, towards an immediate requirement at home of some 5,000. While it is hoped to expand the programme appreciably duringthe year 1948, the fact remains that it has been possible to make provision onthe Navy Estimates of only  200,000 for married quarters at home and even that figure includes some provision for civilian employees and for conversions ofexisting buildings.8. The Admiralty have also to make provision for the accommodation ofthe reserve forces, particularly of the R.N.V.R. Whilst in principle this problemof providing for reserve forces is similar for all three Services, in size it is moremanageable so far as the Admiralty are concerned. The development of reserve forces, such as the R.N.V.R. and the R.M.F.V.R., requires drill ships orcorresponding shore headquarters. Many of the Admiralty&apos;s pre-war drill shipsought to be replaced by newer vessels and it is necessary to provide up-to-dateheadquarters to meet modern requirements for the R.N.V.R. Present-day require-ments for training far exceed those which were needed before the war. Thesc-enlarged requirements arise from the greatly increased complexity of navalmaterial. At present all that can be done on shore is to provide one headquarters(at Hull) by adaptation of an existing building at comparatively small cost. Theother shore headquarters are having to remain in an inadequate condition for efficient &quot;training. To build up efficient reserves, adequate training centres willalso be required for the R.M.F.V.R., for the Air and W/T components of theR.N.V.R. and possibly for the R.N.S.R. Some of these needs are about to mature.9. Considerations of economic planning in the matter of building married quarters have been discussed at the official level between the Service departments and the Ministry of Health pursuant to the Production Committee&apos;s conclusionsof 13th October, 1947; and these considerations, in their application also to barrackand other constructional work for the Naval Service, together with the restric-tions imposed in all directions by labour ceilings, have left the Admiralty no alternative but to prune and limit their works and building projects without anyproper regard to the efficiency and well-being of the Navy. Deployment of the limited resources available over other fields, e.g., construction of Research Estab-lishments and the rehabilitation of the Dockyards at Portsmouth and Devonport,is an inescapable need.10. I consider that the Cabinet should be aware of these facts for they show the inability of my Department under existing conditions to provide, any substan-tial number of married quarters, to bring conditions in the barracks into line with even reasonable welfare standards or, consequently, to fulfil the under-takings given to Parliament referred to in paragraph 1 of this memorandum.H.35034
IITHE ACCOMMODATION OF THE ARMY IN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Secretary of State for War1. The bulk of the accommodation which is available to the Regular Armyin the United Kingdom is so much below modern standards, and accommodationsuitably located for the new Territorial Army is so inadequate, that I must place thefacts before the Cabinet. It is clear that a heavy programme of modernizationand construction will be necessary; the difficulty under present conditions is to plan how and when it should start. I will, therefore, confine mysef in thismemorandum to a bare statement of the facts.2.   For convenience the memorandum is divided into three parts : (a) The accommodation of the unmarried soldier (see Appendix A for details);(b) The provision of married quarters;(c) Accommodation for the Territorial Army.The Accommodation of the Unmarried Soldier3. The long history of the Army has inevitably had the result that thisaccommodation is very uneven in quality and our barracks now range from the comparatively modern Sandhurst block of 1938 with its central heating and up-to-date sanitary and cooking appliances to those built 200 years ago. Some of thelatter, though still in use, have long been condemned and are so damp, dingy anddisreputable that there will be no alternative in due course but to demolish themand erect new buildings. Meanwhile, the unfortunate soldiers compelled to live in them continue to suffer from the unsuitable and uneconomical conditions ofheating and cooking, lack of proper bath and washing facilities and poor lightingdesigned for times when the Army was recruited largely from the criminalclasses, and barracks, surrounded by high walls, were more akin to prisons than to houses. All barracks except the most recently constructed require extensivemodernization to bring them up to present-day standards. Some, such as those at Tidworth, were virtually wrecked by the American Forces and will remainuninhabitable until a major work of reconstruction has been carried out.4. For the last eighteen months, a committee which collaborated at all stages with the other two Services has been examining in detail every form of army accommodation and its findings have shown that even the standards of1938 are inadequate by comparison with present civil specifications. Therecommendations include a considerable revision of our previous conceptions ofprivacy, heating, cooking, lighting and sanitation. Such a modernizationprogramme will cost a lot of money and will have to be spread over a number ofyears but it is absolutely necessary if the Army is to be an attractive career. Forthe present, however, we have put work on married quarters first in priority.5. During the half century before the last war, the tendency was to concentrate the four or five divisions which would form the first contingent of the expeditionary Force at military centres such as Aldershot, Salisbury Plain,Catterick and Colchester. The training of recruits of infantry of the line wascarried out locally in each county at the county barracks. Until just before thewar, there was no organised anti-aircraft defence of the United Kingdom.For the future, the Army at home, because of the introduction of NationalService, will be larger than before the last war and will include as a new featurean anti-aircraft element which must of necessity be dispersed in centres wherepermanent barracks do not exist. Further, the preliminary training of Regularrecruits and the National Servicemen will be concentrated in a few centres. to accommodate the Army at home, extensive use will have to be made of huttedcamps. As a legacy of the war, the Army possesses many hutted camps but thevrange in quality from the excellent militia type to the low grade Nissen variety.Maintenance was perforce largely neglected during the war to the detriment ofboth permanent barracks and the hutted camps. The latter deteriorate more rapidly than the former and a heavy annual outlay is now necessary to maintainminimum standards of comfort. This is a most important consideration when it isremembered that many of our training establishments are located in these camps and that the success of the National Service scheme depends very largely on
providing the yearly intake of young men with a reasonable standard of living.Until the forces withdrawn from Palestine have been accommodated and theArmy at home has settled down on a proper peacetime footing, we shall requireto hold all hutted accommodation which we now possess.Married Quarters6. Before the war we possessed some 16,000 married quarters. This number was insufficient but married officers and other ranks who were unable to getquarters were placed on the &quot;lodging list&quot; and given instead of a quarter asuitable,allowance, and were able, with comparative ease, to rent civilian houses.This is rarely possible to-day as a soldier is not long enough in one station to have any chance of renting civilian accommodation. In addition, the age at whichmarriage is officialy recognized in the Army has been reduced, in the case ofofficers from 30 to 25 and in the case of other ranks from 26 to 21. As a result,there is a shortage of at least another 16,000 quarters and this shortage isparticularly severe in the case of officers quarters. It will obviously take manyyears before such a need can be fully met. Meanwhile, every possible step isbeing taken to make the fullest use of existing quarters, to build as fast as theNational housing policy permits, and to add to their number by the conversionof suitable huts.Accommodation for the Territorial army. The peak numbers of the Territorial Army which we. shall reach in 1954are likely to be not less than three times those of 1938. Although many existingTerritorial Army buildings may be too large for modern needs and some doublingup and sharing with the Regular Army may well be possible, it is evident that thepresent buildings fall far short of the minimum required for the peak numbers.Some units are to be raised where there are no headquarters at all, and apart fromthe requirements of Territorial Army headquarters, new accommodation will be needed at week-end training centres. All this will require a five-year plan whichmust be begun in 1949 if we are to be ready for the full numbers in 1954. on present estimates, this plan will cost not less than  13 million per annum for permanent building and this expenditure must be accepted or the future of theTerritorial Army will be endangered.conclusion. I do not ask that the Army should have a higher standard of living thanthe rest of the community but I wish the Cabinet to take note of the facts I havegiven above, which can be summed up as follows : (a) As regards the bulk of the Army&apos;s barracks, the standard of living haslagged behind that of the civil community (see Appendix A).(b) As regards married quarters, the Army has proportionately a greaterdeficiency than the civil community.(c) As regards the Territorial Army, there is a great danger that the successof the whole scheme will be endangered through National Servicemenjoining Territorial Army units which lack the minimum accommoda-tion that will be necessary.E. S.APPENDIX AArmy Accommodation Standards1.   Army accommodation may be divided generally into three main types : (a) Adapted castles, forts; &amp;c.;(&amp;) barracks in permanent construction;(c) hutting.2.   Adapted Castles, Forts, &amp;c.This category includes mediaeval castles such as Dover Castle, The Tower ofLondon, the Citadel, Plymouth, and Sterling Castle.   It also includes forts, &amp;c,35034 b 3
of more recent date which were adapted to some extent before use. examples are: Fort Picklecombe, Winchester    .........      1848Fort George, Scotland      ............      1757Leith Fort    ..................      18th CenturySheerness     ..................      1750 circa.Most of these buildings have received a series of attempts at improvement ormodernization, but constructions of this age and type are not suitable for moderni-zation to standards in any way acceptable to present requirements. Walls are often many feet thick, windows are adapted arrowslits, gunports or loopholes;sanitary and washing arrangements are either primitive or distant from livingquarters; while the living quarters are adaptations of casemates, stores, &amp;c.The above accommodation houses approximately 6,500 men in the UnitedKingdom and should be condemned as unfit for modern living conditions.3. Barracks in permanent construction.The barracks now used by the Army vary enormously in age and condition.They were built during the following building periods : (a) 1770-1800. There are some fifteen barracks now housing 12,500 still in use of this era including much of such large garrison areas as woolwich and Shorncliffe. Modernisation has been attempted periodically butthe results are not good enough to house men to the standards now considered essential.(6) Napoleonic wars and post-war period 1800-1850. There are about twentymajor barracks dating from this era, as well as a number of minorones. Again some modernisation has been carried out, but the resultnever can be satisfactory. This accommodation includes nearly all the barracks in London and is of extremely low standard. 25,000 men arehoused in this type of accommodation.(c) 1860-1910.   A very large proportion of the Arm&apos;y&apos;s permanent buildingsdate from period 1890-1900. Much of Aldershot was built about this time. The buildings are in good solid construction with walls whichare strong enough to give a great many years of useful life, but mostof the interiors require gutting and rebuilding on modern lines. Atpresent the accommodation provided is large, bare, comfortless barrackrooms, outdoor sanitation and washing arrangements and little else.This accommodation holds some 60,000 men.(d) 1910-1939.  This period shows a marked improvement and, though minor alterations are needed to bring the buildings to proper standards, thesealterations could be deferred owing to the economic position. Catterickis a good example. The accommodation figure for this type is 76,000.4. Hutting.Even before 1939, a few hutted camps were used as permanent barracks andone or two hutted camps actually date from the South African war period. an appreciable number, particularly in the Salisbury Plain area, date from the first world War. All these huts are long over due for replacement and their main-tenance is a heavy drain on resources.The majority of the hutting now in use was built during, or just before, theSecond World War. That built in 1938-40 and known as &quot; militia hutting &quot; is,generally speaking, good, and should last for many years until it can be replaced by proper permanent construction. The hutting built later in the war, chiefly ofthe Nissen type, is quite unsuitable for use except in war-time emergency condi-tions. In spite of constant and ever-increasing maintenance, it is difficult to keep it even weather-proof. In addition, the sanitary and washing arrangements areprimitive and amenities are sadly lacking. The good militia type hutting accom-modates about 107,000 men and the low grade hutting about 234,000.5. Summary of Single Soldiers Accommodation,(a) Permanent A accommodation.

Size of Post- War A rmyThough not yet finally decided, it may be assumed for planning accommoda-tion that the post-war army will be about 200,000 in the United Kingdom. Tothis must be added 20 per cent, to cater for barracks not exactly fitting post-warunits, accommodation for men temporarily attached to training establishments, &amp;c.The total bed requirement for the Army in the United Kingdom will, there-fore, approximate to 240,000. Meanwhile, however, the numbers in the UnitedKingdom are greatly in excess Of this figure and will rise further when the troops are withdrawn from Palestine. All existing accommodation will, therefore, berequired until the Army at home runs down to nearer its proper peace-time size.Even then some of the otherwise surplus temporary accommodation will probablybe required for the Territorial Army.7. ConclusionsIt would appear from the above figures that there is a deficiency of suitable accommodation of about 57,000. The actual deficiency is, however, higher than this. A proportion of the really bad accommodation is situated where troops mustbe located by reason of their duties or because training areas, are available, andsome of the good hutted accommodation is in places where there is no reason forlocating troops in peace-time and where, in fact, there are cogent national interestsfor not doing so, i.e., in national parks, on good agricultural land, or where their presence would interfere with local amenities.ALTHOUGH the Royal Air Force are in many cases housed in permanent accommodation of good quality built in the years immediately preceding the war,it must not be assumed that the R.A.F. of to-day, as a whole, is suitably housed.The strength of the R.A.F. in the United Kingdom at 1st April, 1949, willbe approximately 185,000 men and women, as compared with 103,700 men inSeptember 1939. A number of pre-war permanent stations such as Cranfield,Harwell, Bramcote, Northolt and Farnborough have been handed over to other government Departments since the war, and as a result permanent accommoda-tion, including married quarters, exists only for 78,000 personnel. In addition,barracks for some 1,700 men are under construction. It follows that the bulkof the accommodation now in use by the R.A.F. in this country is temporaryhutting.2. This hutting varies considerably in quality. That erected during thepre-war expansion period is of a reasonable standard although it has suffered from very heavy use and lack of maintenance during the war years. That erectedduring the war was designed to meet as economically as possible a temporarycommitment; it is now far below the minimum standard which can be consideredacceptable.3. The following analysis of the problem is based on the probable strengthof the R.A.F. in the United Kingdom on 1st April, 1949, viz., 185,000.IllR.A.F. ACCOMMODATION IN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air
Domestic Accommodation other than Married QuartersPermanent A ccommodation4. The permanent accommodation of the R.A.F. was, in the main, builtBetween the two World Wars. What there is of it is in good condition, although in some respects it is deficient by present-day civil standards and has suffered a certain amount of bomb damage. In aggregate capacity, however, the permanent accommodation available is designed to house only 72,000 officers and men.5. Not all of this permanent accommodation can, however, be used to thebest advantage. The composition and size of units have changed; and strategicaland technical considerations have altered the disposition of many units. Thus,stations built before the war to &quot; fit &quot; a given unit may be too large or too small for the units which now have to be accommodated in them. In most instancesthey are far too small. In isolated cases and this is usually where the airfield isnot suitable for modern aircraft some categories of personnel are able to enjoyfull peace-time standards of accommodation. In the main, however, considerableovercrowding either overall or in certain categories has to be accepted.6. On this latter point, the trend towards larger aircraft has increased thenumber of men of N.C.O. status. Whereas a pre-war crew numbered three or four(and some of these were aircraftmen) a crew may now number seven or eight, all of whom are officers or the equivalent of N.C.Os. The number of technicalN.C.Os. has also increased. Thus, the existing permanent accommodation doesnot conform at all closely to the categories to be accommodated. Although it is nolonger necessary to accommodate junior officers in airmen&apos;s barrack rooms, except at a few stations, it is still necessary to accommodate a proportion of the sergeantsand aircrew of sergeant status in this way. Apart from the effect on the outlookof the individual, this militates seriously against the prestige of the N.C.O. and isbad from the disciplinary point of view. It is, of course, the policy of the air council to provide sergeants, and aircrew of comparable status, with adequateaccommodation and messes. It is, however, impracticable to implement this policy to any degree at the present moment. Nevertheless, the balancing of this perma-nent accommodation is a commitment which cannot be postponed indefinitely andis One which will entail considerable construction.Temporary A ccommodation7. The temporary accommodation falls into three categories. There are asmall number of hutted stations dating from the 1914-18 war; a large number ofhutted camps, erected during the expansion period immediately before the last war (mainly for the accommodation of ground training establishments); and,lastly, the war-time Nissen, Laing and similar hutting.8. Some of the older camps were condemned before the war, but time didnot permit of their being rebuilt and they are still occupied.9. Camps built during the pre-war expansion period are in the mainstructurally sound and should be capable of use for some years to come, providedlabour can be found to make good the arrears of maintenance incurred duringthe war years. As a result of those arrears they are to-day for the most partunpleasant, dingy and depressing places to live in, and a perpetual source of complaint, both within and outside the Service. In particular, the generalreconditioning of kitchens, dining rooms, ablutions and the like is an urgent necessity. The commitment for repairs is increasing out of all proportion as timegoes on, and it is clearly essential to catch up on the work of maintenance beforefurther good material goes to waste. The present allocation of labour to theAir Ministry is insufficient to enable this to be done.10. Conditions are far worse for the 41,000 personnel who are accomodated in poor quality Nissen and similar hutting erected to meet immediate requirementsduring the war. In the main this is now completely unsuitable for continuedoccupation. In consequence airmen and airwomen are to-day living in conditionswhich would not be permitted by the lowest standards of civilian accommodation.It was of this type of accommodation, at Handforth in Lancashire, that the mayor of Stockport wrote to me recently : &quot; I was, frankly, astounded at the conditions in which men and women are compelled to live at this station. I have a long experience, as a Memberof a local Housing Authority, and I am not unaware of the deplorable
conditions in which numbers of the civilian population are living to-day; but until to-day I had no idea that members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces are compelled, in this country and in peace-time, to live in so much worseconditions than the civilian population. After seeing the leaking roofs, thedilapidatpd and almost ruinous conditions of some of the huts, the primitivewashing facilities and the general unhealthy state of the camp, I feel thatI have no alternative .... to record my surprise and distress at thecondition which I found .... I have not been asked to write to you inthis strain, or to make any sort of protest . .&quot;. . but I cannot conscientiouslylet it pass without comment.&quot;This is typical of the adverse impressions created at present which do so muchto prejudice our recruiting efforts. Rehabilitation is an urgent necessity, and here again the supply of labour is the determining factor.11. The war-time camps suffer from other disadvantages besides thestandard of the hutting. Because of the system of extreme dispersal of buildings adopted during the war at operational stations, personnel have towalk literally miles a day not only to their work, but to the dining-halls,N.A.A.F.I., baths, &amp;c. This results in considerable loss of time; the alternative is an excessive use of M/T. In addition, the sanitary and ablution facilities at most of the dispersed sites are primitive in the extreme. Quite apart from then-effect on the contentment of the Service, these conditions are wholly uneconomicaladministratively as a peace-time arrangement.12. Whilst the number accommodated in war-time hutting will fall withthe run-down of the Force, a large number of the permanent Force must remainin this class of hutting until it can be replaced.Married Quarters13. The R.A.F. is seriously deficient in married quarters for the following reasons: (i) During the expansion period immediately preceding the war married quarters were not built at a large number of stations and no married quarters were built during the war.(ii) The age at which marriage is recognised for Service purposes has beenreduced.(iii) The post-war Air Force will be much larger than it was before the warand the bulk of the Force will be stationed at home.14. Apart from these considerations, personnel are gravely handicapped inthat now, unlike the pre-war period, it is rarely possible to rent houses near theirstations, the majority of which are situated in remote parts of the country.Moreover, R.A.F. personnel have the additional handicap, in relation to the civilcommunity, that frequent postings preclude them from qualifying for a houseunder local authority housing schemes.15. At present there are 6,182 married quarters in the United Kingdom.To these can be added some 410 temporary quarters of primitive type convertedfrom surplus hutting. In addition, we nave under construction or contract afurther 1,628 permanent quarters and approximately 780 conversions fromhutting. On post-war scales an entitlement may exist to some 30,000 quarters.Thus, even when the houses under construction or conversion are completed, weshall be no less than some 21,000 in arrear.16.   Every effort is being made to build as fast as the national housing policypermits and, as a temporary measure, to add to the numbers of available houses by converting suitable hutting. But the depressing fact is that at the present ratej of progress it will be at least ten years and probably more before the needs of thei Service can be fully met.jA accommodation for the Non-Regular Forces17. The organisation of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the Royalj Air Force Volunteer Reserve is based on a net-work of Town Headquarters orI Centres distributed throughout the country, and these are the focal points for,&apos;the instruction, recreation and general administration of the volunteers. If thejl required numbers of volunteers are to be recruited the Town Headquarters orj Centres must be located near to large concentrations of population, and thejlaccommodation provided must be adequate, attractive and, in particular, centrally
situated so as to enable the volunteers to undertake evening and week-end instruc-tion in their spare time. It is not the least of our difficulties that the necessaryaccommodation is required in large centres of population, where accommodation is expensive.18. Suitable accommodation has yet to be obtained for a large number of town Headquarters and Centres; the accommodation provided for a high propor-tion of the units already functioning is improvised and unsatisfactory and, indue course, alternative accommodation will have to be provided.Conclusion19. It will be seen that, as with the other Services, there is an urgent need tobring the living conditions of a large proportion of R.A.F. personnel up to thestandard enjoyed by the civil community. There is also an urgent need to increasethe quota of married quarters. There are reasons peculiar to the R.A.F. whichunderline the importance and urgency of remedying the present state of affairs.The R.A.F. must depend for its efficiency on obtaining a high proportion of regular entrants of good quality. A large proportion of the hutted stations arein Technical Training Command where both the national serviceman and theregular entrant get their first introduction to the Service. Under presentconditions their reactions cannot fail to be critical. No recruiting propagandawill be effective; nor will the type of recruit required be obtained, whilst airmenand airwomen have to live under conditions so far below those in civil life.A. H.
