/(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE ITROi^ERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC *MAJESTY1S  GOVERNfvIENT) ,SECRET COIY NO. JOC.?.(U8)  6927TH FEBRUARY,  19h5CABINETCZECHOSLOVAKIAMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs wish to draw the urgent attention of mycolleagues to the attached telegram from.M. Ambassador, Prague (No. 11+9), giving an appreciation of the present situation in czechoslovakia.    I consider that the concludingparagraphs are of particular interest.E .B *Foreign Office, S.W.I.27th February, 19*4-8.
annex copy of Telegram from H.M. Ambassador, Prague,to the Foreign Office, dated 2b&quot;th February, .No.  1U9.My telegram No. 11+0.In determining your attitude to the proposal ofM. Bidault and Mr. Marshall,  of which my United Statescolleague has now informed me,  it may be useful to you tohove an appreciation of the Czechoslovak situation as we see it.2.       - The first question is whether the situation is inany way still open.      The answer must be explicit and the fact is that by force and intimidation the Communist minority have succeeded under constitutional guise in obtaining control ofthe (gp. undec.? country).      Steps have included, we suspect,prevention of the President from broadcasting or making hisreal views known.      We are now reliably informed that thePresident did yesterday approve the new Government but theterms in which he expressed his approval have been withheld from the public.      He is said to be very ill and to wish to resign but he is a prisoner in the castle and cannot controlhis fate.3. It is true that there is considerable popularindignation but this is organised only amongst the students,who are impotent,  and were brutally beaten up by the police and troops yesterday.      Five were killed demonstrating their loyalty to the President before the castle.      The population asa whole who, whatever their love of freedom, are naturallytimid and doubly defeatist from the memory of the Gormanoccupation, are not capable of serious resistance.      There isalso the feeling that the President and the Socialistscontributed to the debacle by miscalculating their opponents&apos;strength and they failed to take effective action lost week-end when the initiative still lay with them and before the communists had had time to mobilise their full resources.Masoryk is almost universally execrated.U* Therefore,  there seems to be slight prospect ofreversing or arresting the course of events by representationto the Czechoslovak Government and a general declaration would have even less effect.5. The second question is whether the continuingprocess of communisation and anti-Western orientation can be arrested &quot;by any action op the port of His Majesty&apos;s Government,the United States and the French Governments.      There is everyindication that the Communists intend rapidly to complete their strangle-hold in the country by the familiar method ofpurges replacing non-Communists by their own nominees inGovernment departments and State concerns.      There will also
no doubt be the familiar series,  of trumped op chargesagainst the anti-Communists, entailing trials andallegations of treason,  collaboration with the western powers.      It will be easier to frame these charges owingto the close relationships which have existed on the port of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy and United States Embassy withn on-Communist. Czech politicians and other prominent Czechs.A f&apos;oretaste of this has been given in charges which havealready appeared in the press against the Consulates of theWestern Powers in Bratislava.6. A weapon which it lies in the power of theUnited States to consider using is economic.      It is truethat Czech economics will inevitably suffer from inefficiencyresulting from the change in personnel etc., which will presumably make the new regime anxious,  if possible, tomaintain and increase trade and secure credits from thewest.      But in my view the threat of economic penaltiescould not buy the restoration of democracy in Czechoslovakia.On the contrary the new Communist regime is almost certainlyprepared to pay the price of curtailing defensive ties withthe west in order to force their country into the Sovieteconomic orbit and quite certainly able to enforce on thepopulation the lower standard of living which this woulden tail.7. A strong expression to the usurpers of power in czechoslovakia.of the disgust of the British Government and people, for the methods by which they hove acquired and areconsolidating the position might make them squirm thoughit would hardly stop them.      French stock is so low here that a French protest would have little effect even amongstanti-Communists.      If the Czech Communists and their masterswere convinced that the United States and the Western powers were determined that Czechoslovakia should be the lastcountry to be suffessfully exploited by Communist techniquethis might (gp.  undec? give) them pause and bring home tothem that on this second occasion in a decade the forces of democracy did not intend that any further European territory should be lost to dictatorship.      The warning, however,  tobe effective in Czechoslovakia would hove to be given in moscow.(Repeated to Paris and Washington)
