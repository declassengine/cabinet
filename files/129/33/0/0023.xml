HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;       &quot; is printed for the Cabinet.   March, 1949SECRET Copy No.   31CP. (49) 63llth March, 1949CABINETTHE FIRST YEAR&apos;S WORK OF THE overseas food corporation memorandum by the Minister of food the Overseas Food Corporation will soon have been in operation for a year.The forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on the East African Ground-nuts scheme will provide an excellent opportunity for a review of the presentposition and the outlook for the future, and I shall be making a very full statement to the House. My colleagues will no doubt be interested to,have someaccount of the main, questions with which I shall be dealing.The Immediate Position2. The Corporation is concerned with two schemes--a relatively small one in Queensland for the large-scale production of feeding-stuffs, and later, porkand bacon; and the major groundnut venture in East Africa.In Queensland the Corporation^ scheme is running well ahead of its pro-jected rate of development. The scheme was only decided upon in the spring oflast year, and the assumption was that about 20,000 acres could be ploughed andsown in the current crop year. But in fact no less than 30,000 acres have beenploughed and sown, at costs which have turned out to be very low. Rainfall hasbeen satisfactory and the first contribution from this source to our suppliesof feeding stuffs, in the shape of an initial export of 10,000 tons of sorghum,I should be available in a few months&apos; time. (The greater part of the first crop isIbeing kept back for seed.) Pig production will follow in later years : the immediate[concentration is on the production of feeding stuffs.I The scheme is likely to remain relatively modest in comparison with the[groundnuts project. The Corporation have  A.2 million towards the initial[capital and the Queensland Government are participating to the extent of[ 500,000. The advances made by the Corporation to this scheme to date amountjto only  100,000. An area of 300,000 acres has been acquired at a low average[price of 14s. 6d. sterling an acre: another 200,000 acres are being bought, but[having regard to the low cost of land and of ploughing, total capital expenditurein Queensland is not likely to exceed a total of  3 million, even if further areas are in due course acquired. It is planned to have an area of about 100,000 acressown next year.In short, the Queensland scheme has got off to an excellent start. Far moreformidable difficulties have been encountered in East Africa, and the rest ofthis paper will be devoted to that project.3. In East Africa development is taking place in three areas the Kongwaor Central Province area the Urambo or Western Province area, and theSouthern area the largest area of the three, lying near the border of PortugueseEast Africa. The Kongwa.area is the only one where large-scale clearing hasas yet been carried out. Approximately 46,000 acres have been planted therethis year, about half being under groundnuts and half under sunflowers. (SeeParagraph 8 below on the reasons for planting sunflowers as an additional crop.) Development in the Urambo area is at a much earlier stage : anything up toI        36716 b
4,000 acres (making some 30,000 acres for the scheme as a whole) have been clearedand are being sown there, mainly under sunflower.The Southern ProvinceIh the Southern area which, as I believe, is destined to be by far the&quot;most important of the three-the Corporation have deliberately decided to con-concentrate on the construction of the essential communication facilities (a newport and a railway) before attempting large scale clearing and planting.This is a recent decision: it had been thought that clearance would begin on a fair scale in the Southern Province this year even before the permanentport and railway had been built, using temporary road communications. Butexperience has indicated that to do this would involve inacceptably high costs,so the delay in undertaking major clearing operations in the south until thewinter of 1949-50 has had, reluctantly, to be accepted. In general we have cometo the conclusion that we must not buy speed of development at too high a price,and this is the essential cause of the much slower rate of development which isnow forecast.Crop Prospects for This YearAssuming normal yields, production this year from the areas sown in theCentral and Western Provinces will be between 6,000 and 7,000 tons of ground-nuts and about the same amount of sunflower seed.I have just had an encouraging report of the progress of the crops. the rains came late at KOngwa this year, but they have so far been up to averagewhen they did come, and the groundnut crop in particular is above ground andis said to be looking very much better than the crops on most of the relatively small areas cleared last year. It is, of course, much too early to give an exactforecast of this year&apos;s harvest, but it will in any case be possible to say that a first modest contribution to our margarine ration will be made by the schemethis year.The Delay in the Development of the scheme. To clear and plant some 50,000 acres in East Africa is in itself a greatundertaking; some 50,000 acres, or 75 square miles, is eqUal to an area one mile widestretching from the House of Commons to Portsmouth. And I have no doubt thatthe clearance and planting of this acreage in fact represents a considerableachievement. Unfortunately; however, some 50,000 acres actually cleared by1948-49 compares ill with the original estimate made in 1946 by the Wakefieldmission. The Wakefield report estimated that no less than 600,000 acres couldbe cleared and sown by the end of 1948. What are the main factors which have brought about the long delay wMch it is now clear must occur before the scheme has been fully developed ? For it is my present estimate that the period of develop-ment will in fact be some ten years instead of five.5. The basic assumption in the Wakefield report was that by the applicationof modern mechanical methods it would be possible to clear several hundred thousand acres in a single year. Ultimately this assumption may still prove to be completely valid. But it is now abundantly clear, that both the authors ofthe original report and all concerned with the scheme at its inception greatly Over-estimated the speed at which such a vast operation could be got going in Africa.The main factors which have brought about major delays and difficulties are.:-&apos;,. .     &quot; ,  - ..(a) Communications. It was realised from the start that in the main areaof the scheme, in the Southern Province, a wholly new railway and port must in the end be built; but it was thought, erroneously, thatclearance could be got under way before they were ready. Even forthe other areas large additional railway and port extensions were essential. These major works are being pushed on as fast as possible,but in present conditions-given the shortages of equipment and construction material (especially steel) and of skilled technical man-power they are likely to take 3 to 4 years to complete ratherthan the 1-2 years envisaged in the report; This is a major factor in the delay in starting large-scale clearing in the main area of thescheme in the Southern Province.\
(ft) Provision of the necessary facilities and equipment.^^ere^&amp;s a seriousunderestimate of the speed at which the requisite fleet of heavy tractorscould be put into service. The tractors were quickly acquired from war surplus stores and by the conversion of Sherman tanks, But it is taking a &apos;much^&apos;longer time to recohditioh or convert them to their newpurpose than was estimated. Equally, there was. a serious, under-estimationjctf&apos; the time required to erect in the middle of Africa the major !ayijienglheeririg works essential for the scheme-the heavyrepair shops inquired to service the tractors, the necessary housing for both Africans and Europeans, the provision of additional railway;and port facilities on the existing communication system, the establishment/o^,ade.qua^ water supplies and so on(c)Difficulties of clearirig.-Tirie Work of actual clearing, particularly at kongwa, has proved more difficult than was originally anticipated.The acacia bush is not easy to dispose of when initially flattened: atangled mass of roots is left beneath the surface after the initialoperations1, and they require special and prolonged clearance measures :the soil is highly abrasive in the dry season. But&apos; there is good reasonto hope that these difficult conditions will not be met with in the two other areas.\dy Oradnisdtibn^ii has taken longer than was anticipated to build up alarge-scale organisation in Africa and to train raw African labour incompletely novel mechanical work. And although the enthusiasm andcompetence of the main European staff of the Corporation is most encouraging,1 there have inevitably been a number of misfits and failuresin the higher executive posts which are having to be corrected. I am glad to say, however, that, contrary to some early fears, the position asregards the availability and adaptability of African labour is on thewhole satisfactory.The Future Outlook6. Essentially what has happened up to the present is that the effective start of the scheme has had to be delayed by anything up to two years because of thedifficulties to which I have just referred. That in no way invalidates the original decision that this project should be the main British productive effort in overseasagriculture in the post-war period. Though our oWH position has slightly easedin recent months, the World shortage of oils and fats, particularly in the non-dollar area, will remain obstinate and long-enduring.Cost and Revenues of the scheme the fact of this continuing world shortage has, of course, a fundamentalbearing on the economics of the project. On the one hand, it is clear that, giventhe-delays in starting i the scheme and the 1 fact that the cost of providing thenecessary capital facilities was seriously underestimated, the total capital expen:ditiire involved will be, I fear, between 1^ and 2 times the original  25 millionestimated. So far  20 million has been spent, mainly on capital development.But; oh the other hand, the annual revenues of the scheme when it is producing atcapacity may also prove anything up to twice as much as was originally estimated.The assumption on which the scheme was accepted was that the current price forgroundnut seeds would be  30 per ton, dropping in 1952 to  20 per ton. But the comparable price which we are paying for West African groundnuts is to-day  51a tohr &apos; As I have said, there are no signs of such a general easement in the worldposition of this crucial requirement as would point to anything more than a slowand very moderate reduction in price over, say, the next 5-10 years.Objects of the Scheme.^7J -The primary Objective of the scheme is, of course, the production of aSubstantial^ and sustaitied contribution to the world supply of edible and inediblebils. and of cattle feed and to our own supplies in particular. The WakefieldReport: Estimated that 600;000 tons of oil seeds could be produced annually bymeans of the1 clearihgrand: cultivation of approximately million acres. TheCorporation^ latest calculation is that, even if a lower estimated yield per acreis taken than that assumed in the &quot;Wakefield report, it should be possible to producethis volume of oil seeds from an acreage of approximately 2 million acres.36716 B 2
Revised Cropping Programme AThis revised estimate of the total acreage required/is ^e^^^n^-a^prb^bsed^fundamental change in the plans for the rotation of Jcrbps; &apos; The Wakefield Reportproposed a four-year rotation : Only two crops of groundnuts1 would be grown ona given area before the land was rested under grass! The advice of the Corpora-tiOn&apos;s scientific advisers, reached after much experimental work land consultationwith leading scientific authorities, is now that a ten-year rotation should be adopted.During the new rotation, as under the original four-year rotation, the land would be under groundnuts for half the period-^fe., for five years but of ten-under sunflowers for. three years, and for the two remaining years under graiss or possibly a cereal crop. The essential feature is that1 under this revised rotationfour-fifths instead of one-half of the acreage would be under oiUbearing cropsin any given year, resulting in a substantial increase in the production of oil seedsper cleared acre. &apos;:. - .&quot; , &apos;v&apos;   1   &quot;Introduction of Sunflowers as Second Oil-bearing Crop, 8.. It will be seen that the key to this.important new feature of the schemeis the introduction of sunflowers as a second oil-bearing;crop.... The main dis-advantage of sunflowers is that they have a rather lower, content of oil per ton of seed than groundnuts and that in order to avoid deterioration the seed hasto remain undecorticated until the oil.is extracted. On the other hand,.sunflowersnot only provide a rotation crop (being a fundamentally different type of plantfrom groundnuts), but on many soils have,a.higher yield of seed per acre thangroundnuts, are easier to sow on newly, cleared ground, nave a dense growth which gives good cover to the soil and keep down weeds, while, as I have already indicated, their cultivation will enable four-fifths instead of one-half of thecleared acreage to be under oil-bearing crops in any given year.Target Acreage .,9. I have mentioned that the Corporation^ estimate is that 600,000 tonsof oil seeds can be produced from 2 million acres. It should not be inferred,however, that 2 million acres has become a fixed and definite target. Obviouslyit will be some years before a really large area has been cleared;; and &amp;; decision as to what the final acreage target should be will have to be taken then in the lightof the then existing conditions as regards costs of cultivation, the level of oils and fats prices and the like. But the Corporation^ present estimate is that something between 1 and 1^ million acres is the minimum which should be cleared,in the sense that if a lesser acreage were cleared the annual revenue which, wouldbe derived from the scheme could hardly give an economic return on the capital investment. . . . . .\   -Proposed Speed of Development. ...!Y     .        &apos;M10. One crucial question which will have to be decided is that of the speedat which development should take towards the attainment of the full clearedacreage of, say, 1^-2 million acres. This is a problem to which the corporation is devoting close attention but on which it will not he able to put forward a fully considered view until after the outcome of this season&apos;s clearing and planting isknown. The problem is essentially one of balance. High-speed development isdesirable in view of the pressing need of the world for more supplies of oils and fats. But the compression of a great deal of effort into&apos; a short space of timemeans that capital works and services have to be built up to a level about that required for the continuing needs of the scheme. This additional expendituredoes not create any revenue-earning assets. On the other hand; too slow a develop-ment means not only that the provision of urgently needed supplies is postponedbut that the revenue-earning stage of the scheme is delayed with a consequent increase in the capital expenditure at risk. :All that I can say on this general question at the moment is that it nowlooks as if the right balance will be struck by thinking of the scheme as one whichmay take some ten years to complete (instead of the five years envisaged in theWakefield Report). As I have said, the Corporation will be submitting their considered views on this question in the light of their experience in the currentseason. . , V.;IV11. The Corporation should also at that time have had sufficient experience to be able to decide definitely upon what areas in East Africa their main effort
will be concentrated. The spreading of the operation over three areas is attractivein that the risk of simultaneous crop failures is minimised and--wider experience is gained of operations under diverse conditions. But it is probable that, inthe outcome, as soon as the new railway and port facilities become available, theCorporation will decide to concentrate its; maximum effort in the southern area,and to limit the expansion of operations at both Kongwa and IJrambo. TheSouthern area is potentially by i far the; mpst. attractive and fertile area of thethree: clearing should be easier there than at Kongwa and climatic conditionsmore favourable. But, as I have already explained, the Corporation havedecided in my view wisely-^that large-sca^e development ih the area must await,the completion of adequate permanent communications. The Hew railway should reach the edge of the groundnut area in September, but it wjll probably be a yearlater that the first deep-water berth at ^mndeni wili be available and that thismajor area can be developed without communications becoming a limiting factor.Conclusion12. The rate of progress has been disappointing; some serious mistakeshave been made; the cost of the scheme will be heavier than the original estimate;there may well be further serious obstacles of which we are as yet unaware.But no one expected a great new experiment like this tti run like clockwork fromthe start. Nothing that has happened affects in any way, in my view, the absoluterightness of the decision to go ahead with this great constructive enterprise. Itwill go down to history, not only as a resolute measure of self-help, but as oursignal contribution, initiated and pressed forward in the midst of great difficulties, to the rehabilitation of the under-developed areas of the world.J.
