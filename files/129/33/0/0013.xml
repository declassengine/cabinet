SECRETCP. (49) 53COx^Y NO. 3 (7TH MARCH. 1949CABINETGERMAN ELECTORAL LAWMemorandum by.the Secretary of State for&quot;Foreign AffairsPresent PositionIn addition to drafting the Basic Lav/, theParliamentary Council at Bonn has produced a draft electoral law for the trizonal area.   This action was ultra vires, and thethree Military Governors have informed the Parliamentary council that the Ministers President in the Western Zones should take appropriate steps to prepare the,necessary legislation in eachLandtage, but that they are free to use the draft electoral lawprepared by the parliamentary Council as a basis for thepreparation of a model low to be submitted to the Landtage ofthe individual Laender for enactment.R e c omme agenda t i on s2. I recommend to my colleagues:(l)    that they approve the decision of the threeMilitary Governors to withdraw the preparationof electoral laws for Western Germany from theParliamentary Council-and to entrust it to thevarious Ministers President and Landtage, whohave been told that they may work on the basis of thedraft produced by the Parliamentary Council.Background History3. On i+th June. 1948* I circulated to my colleaguesa paper (C.P.(U8) 1U2) setting out the electoral systems inthe Western Zones of Germany and comparing the systems in forcein each zone.   That paper made it clear that the electoral laws and- machinery ?rere a matter for the individual Laender and thatit was neither desirable nor possible to ensure that one system should be adopted throughout Germany.    It also pointed out thatthe electoral systems in all but one of the Laender in the western zones already included safeguards against splinter&apos; parties.   Mycolleagues will also remember that during the Moscow meeting ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers I made it clear, that I was strongly opposed to proportional representation, but that I felt that the electoral system for Germany was one which theGermans should draw up and that it would be wrong for any(2)that I be authorised to instruct the Military governor to use such influence as he can to ensure that as many Laender as possible enact electoral laws v/hichwould lead to the adoption of a majority system as opposed to a system of proportional representation.

external xDower to impose any particular system upon them.   none of the other three Foreign Ministers supported me in my oppositionto a system of proportional representation, but it was agreedthat the final decision on the matter should rest with the Germans.h*. At the present time the attitude of the French is thatthey would favour proportional representation and certainly wouldnot he prepared to impose a majority system upon the Germans.The Americans are strongly of opinion that the whole matter must be -left to the Germans to decide, and in any case they are infavour of proportional representation.5* Among the Germans the issue is a matter of hotpolitical controversy.    The Social Democrats are in favour of proportional representation, though a minority of them,particularly those who have experienced the electoral system which has been in force in the British zone for the last twoyears, realise the advantages of a majority system with singlemember constituencies.   The main reason why the Social Democratsfavour proportional representation is that&quot;they fear that underthe majority system they would lose the forthcoming elections in Germany to the Christian Democrats.    The Christian Democratson the other hand are entirely in favour of the majority system,largely for electoral reasons.6. The draft electoral law which the ParliamentaryCouncil has produced provides for a Lower House of i+lO members,of whom 205 will be elected from individual electoral districtsby majority vote and 205 will be chosen from Land lists on thebasis of proportional representation based on the total validvote cast in the whole trizonal area.   The result will thereforebe a largely proportional representation system.    This electoral law appears to me unsatisfactory for the following reasons.The first is that the party machine is given a dominant role asa result of proportional representation and has power to draw up party lists, with the result that there is no direct contact between the individual voter and his candidate.    This is because it is the party machine, and not the voters, which decides the candidates and their order of preference on the lists.    Thesecond objection is that there is no safeguard against splinterparties.    The lav/ is also open to objection because the constituencies for which it provides are too large.7* This draft electoral law is a retrograde step, and itis weaker in the protection which it affords against splinterparties than the Weimar Constitution, which was itself largelywrecked by splinter parties.    If this law were adopted for thewhole of the trisonal area, there would be little likelihood ofevolving a two or three party system in Germany.8. I have had an exchange of telegrams with general robertson on &quot;the draft electoral lav/.   He agrees with my viewthat it is unsatisfactory for the reasons given above, but hepoints out that v/e are not in a position to impose anyparticular system on the Germans, especially in view of theattitude of the Americans and the French.   General Robertson alsomakes the important point that this draft is not intended to bea permanent electoral law for the German Federal State, but onlythe law for the election of the first Volkstag.   He further pointsout that the reason why the Social Democratic Party havesupported it is that to which I have referred above and that if asystem of simple majority were adopted,  the Christian Democratsmight obtain such a majority that they could take action in certainfields, for instance the staffing of the Civil Service, which  /ould have serious effects for the future of Germany.    It isdesirable that the first government established under the draftelectoral law should be a coalition government, and the best

chance of ensuring this is that the Social Democratic Party-are well represented, as they will he under a system whereproportional representation plays a large part.9- In these circumstances I think that the decision which the Military Governors have takon, namely, to remove the preparation of the electoral law from the ParliamentaryCouncil to the Ministers President, is right.   The effect should he that in certain Laonder at any rate electoral lawswill be passed which are closer to our ideas and in whichproportional representation, if not entirely eliminated,will at least bo cxirtailod.    In other Laender, the proportional representation system may prevail.   I think it probablehowever that out of this there should emerge a system of lawswhich, while not being entirely uniform, will not be toodissimilar, and which will strike a fair balance between thetwo systems.   Since there are already safeguards againstsplinter parties in the majority of the Laender in western germany, there is, I think, a good chance that these safeguardswill be carried over into the new laws which the MinistersPresident and the Landtage are to draft.-E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.I.,7th March, 1949,
