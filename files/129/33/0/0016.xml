COPY NO.CABINETTHE NORTH ATLANTIC PACTMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.I submit for the approval of my colleagues the final text of the North Atlantic Pact, as it has now been agreed in washington between Mr. Acheson and the representatives of theUnited Kingdom, Canada, France and the Benelux countries, andremitted to Governments for approval.The plan- is that when the Governments concerned have indicated   their approval (and if possible &quot;on Friday) the textshall oe sent to the Governments of Norway, Italy, Denmark,Portugal and Iceland with an invitation to become associatedwith the. Pact.      Whether this association is to be by accessionor by signature is not yet finally cleared up.      The text will then be published on Tuesday, 15th March, having previously been communicated by ourselves to the other commonwealth  /ealthGovernments and by the United States Government to the signatories of the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro, that is to say,to all the Central and South American Powers.      Signaturewould take place about a fortnight later, and the Pact would enter into force on ratification by the seven originalsignatories, say two months after that.RecommendationI recommend that the Cabinet approve the text of theNorth Atlantic Pact and authorise me to inform the otherGovernments concerned that His Majesty&apos;s Government are willing to sign it.ObservationsMy colleagues v/ill observe that Article 5 (mutual assistance), which is the key article of the Treaty, has   xemerged in a form which can be regarded as very satisfactory.Notwithstanding the doubts and fears caused by the Senatedebate of 1 kth&quot;February, the Senate leaders have accepted awording which retains the conception that an attack on one ofthe parties is an attack on all, as well as making clear thatthe measures which &quot;the signatories are bound to take in the face of such an attack include &quot;the use of armed force&quot;.     Wecould have preferred to see the words &quot;as it deems necessary&quot;read &quot;as may be necessary&quot;;    but the Senatorial leaders were unwilling to give way on this.      We have, however,  succeeded in eliminating from this Article any reference to &quot;constitutionalprocesses&quot;, though we were not able to avoid this idea appearingelsewhere in the Treaty (Article 11).SECRETCP. (U-9) 56STH MARCH,  19^4-9IS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

There is one other point on which we could not getwhat we wanted;    our- troops in Greece, not being &quot;occupationforces&apos;.&apos;, would not be covered by the provisions of Article 6.We tried unsuccessfully to get the phrase changed to &quot;armed forces&quot;.On the whole we can be well satisfied with the resultsof the long negotiation which has taken place over this text;the Pact has teeth in it and will give strong grounds forencouragement to Europe.At the&apos; same time, it is strictly a defensive pact and in harmony with the Charter of the United Nations.      its object&apos; is to reinforce but not to replace the security pro-vided by the Charter, and Article 7 specifically provides- thatit does not affect in any way the rights and obligations ofthe parties under the Charter or affect the primary responsibility-responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of inter-national peace and security.      The Pact is consequently basedon Article 51  of the Charter, which safeguards &quot;the inherentright of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member ...... until the Security council has taken the measures necessary.......&quot;We have been successful in avoiding any reference in the text of the Pact&apos;, or in the preamble, to Chapter viii of the United Nations Charter, which refers to &quot;RegionalArrangements&quot;.      These regional arrangements were to be forthe purpose of dealing with differences between parties in acertain region, and not between the regional group as a whole and some potential outside aggressor.      Moreover, under the charter, no enforcement action can be taken under a &quot;RegionalArrangement&quot; without the authorisation of the Security Council,which, would have brought&apos; us back to where we started, facedwith the right of veto.      It is therefore important to stress,in any publicity regarding the Atlantic Pact, that it isfirmly based upon Article 51  of the Charter.As ray colleagues know, I have always been very&apos;doubtful about the &quot;wisdom of associating Italy with the Pact,at any rate to begin with, though it has been clear all alongthat we should have to agree to this if the United Stateswanted it.      As it turned out, the Soviet pressure on Norwaymade it impossible, once the Norwegian Government had decidedto seek entry into the pact, to oppose her. immediate acceptance;and the French then insisted with the utmost vigour that Italymust be no less favourably treated.      My main care has been tosee -(a) that so far as possible all the Governments who areto join the Pact apart from the original seven shouldbe given equal status and equal treatment;    and  .(b) that they are not given an opportunity to delay theconclusion of the Pact itself.. These two objectives have, I think,, been successfully secured.Now that Italy is definitely to be associated with the pact, it has become impossible to leave Turkey and Greece entirelyout in the cold, and I have authorised our Ambassador to support adeclaration on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (49) 37, tobe issued at the moment of signature.      If the United StatesGovernment desire it, this declaration will also cover Iran.-    E, B.oreign Office, S.W. 1.8TH MARCH,  1949.
