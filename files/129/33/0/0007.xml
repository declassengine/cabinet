this  document is the property of his britannic  majesty&apos;s government       n printed for the Cabinet.   March 1949Copy No. 3CABINETIRELAND bill memorandum by the Prime Minister1 THE Cabinet should be aware of developments which have itaken place; since they considered 1 a provisional draft of the.. Ireland Bill (C.P. (49) 5) on12th January (CM. (49) 1st Conclusions, Minute 2).2. Date, of Introduction of Bill--At that time.jit.-was..understood that the eire Government would bring the, Republic:,of Ireland-Act,into operation on21st January; and it was contemplated that our ronsequential^egi^a&amp;iQii should joeintroduced and passed,: as a matter ;of urgency, as soon as Parliament reassembledafter the Christmas recess. At the last moment, however, the Eire, government decided that their Act should not be brought into operation until Easter Monday(18th April), the anniversary of the Easter Rising,of 191.6; ^I considered with theMinisters immediately concerned whether we should proceed with our Bill,as originally proposed, providing for it to come-into operation on an appointed day.There would have been some advantages in this course, particularly from the pointof view of the Parliamentary time-table. But we all felt that the balance ofadvantage lay on the side of waiting until the Eire legislation had actually beenbrought into operation especially as it should be made abundantly clear that itis the Eire Government themselves who; by their own action, have taken Eire outof the Commonwealth. We wish to give no one any pretext for representing thatthe United Kingdom Government have taken any initiative in the direction ofthrusting Eire out of the Commonwealth.     1 . ;    .i;., I therefore recommend that the Ireland Bill should not be introduced until after the Easter Recess...... 3.   King&apos; s title the Cabinet agreed that, sut? ject to $Lis lytajesty&apos;s pleasureand to the. views, of other Commonwealth Governments, the Ireland ,Biiil should include provision: for changing the Royal Style and Titles by substituting&quot;Northern Ireland &quot; for &quot; Ireland.&quot; I ascertained; that His Majesty would not object to this change and the proposal was,put to the other commonwealth governments. All save Canada and Pakistani concurred in the change and under-took to promote corresponding: legislation in their; mParliaments, the PrimeMinisters of Canada and Pakistan have, however, raised objections which theycannot be persuaded to withdraw. ... &quot; -, 1   .,iiiirrCertain; sections of Canadian opinion have for some time past been dis-satisfied, with the fact that Canada is included in the Royal Title only underthe, general description of &apos;&apos; Britjsh Dominions, overseas1and&apos; particular6bjectionis; taken to the. Latin,version of that phrase^-&quot; sub ditione Britannica.&quot;,Xhe. Canadian Government are under a, pledge,to their Parliament to take aneaply.Opportunity of raising, at a Commonweaith Conference; the question of;ageneral change in the King&apos;s.Title. They therefore felt that it would&apos;be politically impossible &apos;for them to promote-in their Parliament legislation dealing with theKing&apos;s Title which was confined to the simple change of substituting &quot; NorthernIreland&quot; for &quot;Ireland.&quot; While, therefore, they would not object if other36665secretC.P.

Commonwealth Governments made this limited change, they would not themselvesdo more than announce that the expression &quot; Great Britain and Ireland- wasno longer appropriate in view of Eire&apos;s change of status and that proposals for removing that anomaly and other existing anomalies in the Title would be laidbefore their Parliament in due course after the question of a more general changein the Title had been discussed with other Commonwealth Governments.The Prime Minister of Pakistan is satisfied that he could not introduce legislation authorising this limited change in the King&apos;s Title without arousinga constitutional controversy which would be extremely embarrassing to hisGovernment at the present time. He thinks it would be impossible for him to convince either his Constituent Assembly or his people generally that Pakistan,by remaining within the Commonwealth, would enjoy advantages substantially greater than those secured by Eire. In these circumstances he has asked that legislation affecting the King&apos;s Title should be deferred until the whole questioncan be fully examined.4. It would be unsatisfactory for the United Kingdom Government tointroduce legislation authorising this change in the King&apos;s Title knowing that two of the other Commonwealth Governments were not prepared to introducecorresponding legislation. It is also undesirable that frequent changes shouldbe made in the King&apos;s Title. As the Cabinet will be aware, there will probablybe an opportunity to discuss, early in the summer, the question of a general changein the Title; and, if agreement were then reached on some general change, further legislation would be necessary. In all the circumstances I consider that the best course will be to abandon the proposal for making the limited change of substitu-ting &quot; Northern Ireland &quot; for &quot; Ireland.&quot; There will be no difficulty in explain-ing to other Commonwealth Governments our reasons for this change of plan.And, if the introduction of the Ireland Bill is postponed until after the easter recess, the fact that the Bill makes no provision on this point will probably bemore easily explained then than it would have been earlier in the year.I therefore recommend that no provision should be included in the IrelandBill for a change in the King&apos;s Title.* 5. Title of Eire-On. 12th January the Cabinet agreed that the Ireland Billshould formally recognise &quot; the Republic of Ireland&quot; as a statutory description of the country hitherto known as Eire, but that in official usage the description&quot;the Irish Republic&quot; should be more commonly employed. Since then I havehad a further discussion with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, who hasurged very strongly that the expression &quot; the Irish Republic &quot; should be used inthe Ireland Bill. His argument is that the Eire Government have used the description &quot; Republic of Ireland &quot; in furtherance of their claim to jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland; and that the recognition of that title by the parliament at Westminster would be regarded in the North as implying recognition of thatclaim and suggesting that Partition was only a temporary arrangement. He alsoargues that, if legislation passed by the Parliament at Westminster gives coun-tenance to the title &quot; Republic of Ireland,&quot; this will greatly increase the difficultyof preventing &quot; Ireland &apos; from coming into common use in the United kingdom as a description of the South. He admits that the provisions to be included inthe Ireland Bill, as now drafted, would not, as a matter of law, give any support to this claim of the Eire Government; but he is gravely concerned at the feelingwhich may be aroused in the North if Eire Ministers seek to misrepresent the significance which is to be attached to the fact that the term &quot; Republic of Ire-land &quot; has been used in United Kingdom legislation. He therefore urges that,even if the Ireland Bill must begin by referring to the title (&quot; Republic of Ire-land &quot;) used in the Eire legislation, all subsequent references in the Bill should beto &quot; the Irish Republic.&quot; ,6. I have considered this suggestion very carefully, in consultation withthe Ministers directly concerned, and have received the advice of parliamentary counsel. I am satisfied that it would be quite inappropriate, in legislation eonse-quential upon an Eire Act which provides that the twenty-six counties shall infuture be known as &quot; the Republic of Ireland,&quot; to make ostentatious use of thealternative title &quot; the Irish Republic.&quot; Ministers defending the Bill would find it difficult to explain publicly the significant difference which Ulster sees betweenthe noun &quot; Republic of Ireland &quot; and the adjective &quot;Irish Republic &quot;; and this
refusal to recognise the title which the&quot; South has chosen for itself would be-regarded as a policy of pin-pricks, for which we could expect; neither sympathynor support from other Commonwealth Governments. Moreover, a refusal to use the title &quot; Republic of Ireland &quot; in any circumstances would involve us in con-tinuing friction with the Eire Government: it would perpetuate the inconveniencesand indignities which we now experience as a result of our present policy ofinsisting on the title &quot;Eire &quot; as against Dublin&apos;s preference for &quot; Ireland.&apos;&quot;7. I therefore recommend that the Ireland Bill should formally recognise the title &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; as a description of the twenty-six counties.Subject to this, however, some concessions can be made to meet the views of theNorthern Ireland Government. First, we should undertake that in official usagewe will also employ the description &quot; the Irish Republic.&quot; Secondly, we should so amend Clause 1 of the Ireland Bill that the first reference to &quot; the republic of Ireland &quot; appears as a reference to the title which the Eire Government,.have. themselves chosen as a description of the twenty-six counties. Thirdly, we should in the Ireland Bill describe the twenty-six counties as &quot; the part of Irelandhitherto known as Eire.&quot;8. The Westminster Franchise. On 12th January the Cabinet asked meto make a further attempt to persuade the Prime Minister of Northern ireland to reduce the residential qualification for the franchise for the Northern ireland parliament (e.g., from seven to five years) in return for the introduction of aresidential qualification of three months for the exercise in Northern Ireland ofthe Westminster franchise.I have had a further discussion with Sir Basil Brooke on this point. He hasassured me that his Government gave the most careful consideration to this pro-posal, and would have been glad if they could have helped the Home Secretaryto meet the criticisms which are likely to be raised at Westminster by any pro-posal to amend the law in relation.to elections in Northern Ireland. They were satisfied, however, that it would be politically impossible for them to put thisproposal before their Parliament at the present time. As their law now stands,the franchise for their Parliament is limited to British subjects of full age whowere either born in Northern Ireland or have resided in the United kingdom for the seven years immediately preceding the qualifying date. The second partof this qualification was deliberately designed to prevent Eire citizens fromexercising the franchise in Northern Ireland until they had identified themselves with the United Kingdom by a substantial period of residence there. The needfor this protection would not be diminished indeed, it would actually beincreased by Eire&apos;s change of status. The Northern Ireland Government feelvery strongly that the electorate for their Parliament should be truly representa-tive of Northern Ireland; and that the moment at which Eire leaves the. Common-wealth is certainly not an appropriate time at which to propose any relaxation of safeguards which were thought necessary even when Eire was&apos; within theCommonwealth.9. I find it difficult to resist these arguments. There is a good case on the merits for imposing a three-months&apos; residence qualification for the exercise ofthe Westminster franchise in Northern Ireland; and I propose, with the con-cur rence of the Home Secretary, that we should include a provision to this effect in the Ireland Bill, even though the Northern Ireland Government are unable to promise any reduction in the period of the residence qualification for the franchisefor the Northern Ireland Parliament.10. Draft of Ireland Bill. If the Cabinet approve my proposals inprinciple, a revised draft of the Ireland Bill will be submitted for detailed examination by the Legislation Committee. The Bill can then be held in readiness for introduction at an appropriate moment after the Easter Recess.11. Summary.- The recommendations made in this memorandum may besummarised as follows : (a) The Ireland Bill should not be introduced until after the Easter Recess(paragraph 2).(6) It should not include any provision for a change in The King&apos;s Title(paragraph 4). y 11 .
(c) It should formally recognise, the title &quot;Republic of Ireland &quot; as the description of the jjart of Ireland heretofore known as Eire,; although in.,official.usage tl)edescription &quot;the Irish Republic&quot; will also bei  employed (paragraph 7). ......... ...   .       .   ,(d) It should include a provision imposing a three-mqnthsJ  residencequalification for the exercise of the Westminster franchise in NorthernIreland, even though, the Northern Ireland Government are notprepared to reduce-the period, of the residence qualification for the franchise for the Northern Ireland Parliament (paragraph 9).C.
