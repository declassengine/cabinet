February 1949CONFIDENTIALOP.&apos; (49) 4428th February, 1949No.31CABINETPersians Sevens ear planMemorandum by the Secretary of State von. Foreign affairs it has now been announced that the Persian Majlis passed the Bill forthe Persian Seven-Year Plan tin 16th February in substantially the form in whichit Was presented to them by the Majlis Gommission.; 2. The Plan was first announced in the Spring of 1946, but this Plan, Whichwould have cost a total of about  450 million Was far beyond the financial capacityof the Persian Government and iri order to arrive at a more selective programme and to be able to judge whichl schemes wereeconomically sound, the PersiariGovernment invited a Commission of tFnited States engineers to visit the country.The Commission arrived at the end of 1946, and after completing their investiga-titinS, they submitted a report to the Persian Government in July 1947. Thegeneral finding of the Commission Was that Persia&apos;s major efforts should bedirected towards an increased efficiency in agricultural production and it was emphasised that industry should be left to develop slowly and naturally. Theplanflers prepared a list of schemes Which they considered should be carried outtinder the $250 million programme. The present Bill is based on this reportaid envisages a development programme to be carried out in seven to eight years at a Cost of 21,000 million rials or, at the official rate of exchange, some 160 million to be expended as follows  Years covered1948-491949^501950-511951-521952-531953-541954-551955-56Expenditure inmillion rials1.0002,0002,8003,2003,5003,6003,6002,200* The importance of the present Plan lies in the fact that it is the attempt to carry out a long-term ,Plan of economic reform in Pers a which hasPanted m recent years by the lack of continuity in Governments(there have been some ninety Governments in the forty-two years since the proclamation of the Constitution); and according to Article 1 of the Law the pSis designed for the purpose of increasing the productive capacity and expansion in the volume of exports preparing public requirements at home, mpSS^agrictdture and industry exploitation of mines and other resource7eSpec?Xoil completion of means of transport, reforms in public health and for carrvinaout measures in the development of the country, raising the general standard nflife and education, bettering employment conditions ana redSminthe ccS of36628

V&quot;Creation of water-systems and supply of power to theprovinces ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...Prevention of disease and prophylactic measures with theobject of improving public health ...      ...      ...      ...Aid to educational institutions and training of technical experts        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...Scientific studies and research map-making preparation of statistics and other works ,of public utility       ...... 800Prisons      ... ...      ........ 2004. The question of financing the execution of the Plan has still to be settled and is likely to present difficulties as the sum available from the Anglo-iranian oil Company&apos;s royalties which have been earmarked for development: projectsihside Persia over the next seven years will depend on the result of the Company^present negotiations with the Persian Government. , The Persians have also still to.negotiate a loan for specific development projects from the International Bank.These difficulties should not, however, prevent the Government proceeding withthe first year&apos;s programme and, provided the political situation permits,-the persians should be in a position, to make a start shortly on those essential measures&apos;&apos;of economic development to, whidh I attach the greatest importance as the onlysure defence against Communism.! i 5: The Government have already engaged an American group-OverseasConsultants Incorporated--to draw up a report, on the priorities to be given tothe various projects included in the Plan, and an advance party of this group,&apos;with which the British firm Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, is associated is nowin Tehran. Mr.: Murray, of-the British Middle East Office, has been asked to supervise the statistical work and the Americans have also agreed in principle tothe&apos;engagement of.an1 expert f rom the Port of London Authority to advise on portclearance problems. According to the law as now passed the report which is to beprepared by this group is now to be submitted to the Persian PlanningOrganisation within three months.6. The Bill provides for a Supreme Planning Authority, consisting of an advisory Council of seven members, a Board of Control of six members and aManaging Birector. Under the original draft, the Advisory Council would beappointed by the Shah on the proposal of the Government and would hold office for the whole period of the programme. The Managing Birector would beappointed for three years, but his appointment could be renewed for the remainingperiod of the Plan. The Board sof Control would be^elected by the Majlis andwould hold office for two years. The Government of the day would be connectedwith the Planning Organisation through the Board of Control which would havethe right to report direct to the Government and might be charged by the Govern-ment to carry out investigations. The Planning Organisation are required toobtain the approval of the Council of Ministers before employing foreign expertswho may be employed for a period not exceeding one year after the period of theexecution of the programme. In passing the law, the Majlis have amended thedraft Bill to ensure that all appointments to the Planning Organisation should be approved by them before being confirmed by the Shah and have stipulated thatcredits under the Plan should only be used for paying technical personnel and not for increasing salaries. They have also laid down that the Planning authority is to be staffed with Civil Servants drawn from Ministries, who will continue toreceive their present salaries.7. I have not received full details of these, amendments^ but it would seem that the Majlis have now imposed a stricter control oh the authority of theAdvisory Council to carry out the programme on its own authority once it has been
approved by the Seven Year Plan Commission of the Majlis. This is unfortunate,as it may complicate the practical application of the Plan. It is, however, to be,hopedthat the Persians will appreciate the necessity for engaging foreign experts to assist the Planning Organisation in the detailed execution of the programme and that these advisers wilt be able to prevent to some extent the Government of theday frittering away the sums allotted to the various projects in the grant offictitious contracts to their friends and supporters. Both His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the United States Government have on all possible occasions stressed theimportance of economic development and reform to the Shah ahd to the PersianGovernment. It is to be hoped that the satisfactory co-operation established between the American group of Overseas Consultants and the British firm ofSir Alexander Gibb and partners in the initial planning stages of the programme is symptomatic of the collaboration which can be expected in the measures whichare to be taken in the later stages to raise the standard of Jiving in Persia and toimprove the social and economic position of the Persian peasant, who has for solong been exploited by a small and wealthy minority of land-owners and merchants.E.
