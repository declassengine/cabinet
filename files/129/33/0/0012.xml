this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA]ESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation  of this  paper has been  strictly limited. - -It is issued for the personal use of      /*U-v M*^^-^^T^^6iTOP SECRET Copy No.C.P.&apos;(49)  525TH MARCH,  1949CABINET3/SITUATION IN MALAYA AND HONG Kong memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the ColoniesWith reference to C. M. (48) 80th Conclusions,Minute 3, it will be of interest to my colleagues to know what steps have been taken to strengthen our position in hong Kong and Malaya.HONG KONG2. After consultation between the Commanders-in-Chief,Par East, the Governor of Hong Kong and the Chiefs of staff committee, the Commanders-in-Chief, Par East, have now prepared a revised assessment of the probable threats and ofthe forces required to meet them.     They share the view ofthe Governor of Hong Kong that the possible short-termthreats to Hong Kong are:-(a) internal unrest likely to be inspired by theCommunist-dominated Trades Unions;  -(b) large-scale influx of refugees by land and/orby sea;(c) external aggression by guerrilla bands,probably Communist-inspired.&apos;They regard the likelihood of an organised Communist attackon Hong Kong with a view to its rendition, or a full-scale attack supported by Russian specialists, as remote possi-bilities that need not be considered at present.3. Threat (a) above might occur at any time with little warning if the Communists thought that it would be totheir advantage, and we must therefore be prepared to meet it.The Governor thinks, that threats (b) and (c) are less likelyto occur than when this question was considered in December.Nevertheless, the. threats do exist and, for planning purposes,the Comraanders-in-Chiof considered that they should be regardedas possible at any time after March, 1949, with probably amonth&apos;s warning.4. Availability of forces.(i)    Royal NavyExisting Naval forces in the Par East are sufficient to meet the threats under all heads ifoccurring separately or simultaneously, but, if a     . ,crisis arose simultaneously in Hong Kong and

Shanghai, assistance to Hong Kong should be given priority, and the forces available for the evacua-tion of Shanghai would be substantially reduced.Moreover, Hong Kong would not be available as atransit base for Shanghai evacuees.     A number ofharbour craft in Hong Kong are being refitted atonce for coastal patrol work when the need for .this arises.(ii)   ArmyIf the threats under (a), (b) and (c) occursimultaneously before the end of 19k9, two BrigadeGroups at least would be required at Hong Kong.One is already available there, and the second would have to be found from outside the Par Eastarea, unless operations in Malaya are to be seriously interfered with.      One Battalion and one a. 0.P. Plight from security forces in Malaya are,however, being earmarked to reinforce Hong Kong,should it be necessary, as a temporary advanceguard of the second Brigade reinforcement referredto above (see paragraph 5 below).      Shanghai and burma commitments are likely at any time to put a heavy load on already over-strained resources inthis theatre.(iii)   Royal-Air ForceAn Air Force reinforcement would be requiredto meet the simultaneous occurrence of the threatsunder (a), (b) and (c), and can be provided fromforces available in the Far East provided that the recruitment of the Hong Kong Defence Force Air Unitis proceeded with.     -But if any one of the threatsarose simultaneously with evacuation from Shanghaiand/or Burma, it would be difficult to give fullassistance^to Hong Kong.5. The Chiefs of Staff Committee generally agree withthe foregoing appreciation.     They further agree that no landforce reinforcements ought to be sent at the present time to -Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, despite the desirability of forestalling an emergency-in Hong Kong, but that one Brigade&quot;Group should be held in readiness from April till the end of191+9,     Two months, however, might have to elapse beforereinforcements could arrive in Hong Kong.6. The following matters have been urgently examined bythe Governor in consultation, where necessary, with the local military Authorities and the British. Defence Co-co-ordination committee, Par East:-(a)   Closing of land frontier in the event of a threatened influx of refugees,the frontier could be completely wired in 1k days,the essential minimum being completed in h days.The Governor considers that no wiring should be doneuntil the threat appears imminent, as once it is donepolice and troops will have to guard it, and itserection would cause uneasiness on the frontier andmight lead to incidents (there is a tacit under-standing at present whereby both Communist guerrillasand Chinese Government troops respect the frontier).The Chiefs of Staff Committee have accepted theGovernor&apos;s recommendations.

(b) Closing of sea frontierThis question presents considerable difficultiesowing to shortage of suitable vessels for patrolwork.      Immediate steps are being taken by the naval commander-in-Chief, Par East, to remedy this situation, and Naval personnel will be madeavailable when required to man additional patrol vessels.(c) Evacuation of EuropeansThere can be no question of the compulsoryevacuation of Europeans from Hong Kong.     Plans havebeen made for the temporary reception of British-sponsored evacuees from China, on their journey to final destinations.(d) - RationingA rationing system is already in existence, andis capable of rapid expansion.     Expansion would not,however, have any effect upon immigration into theColony.      Supplies of certain essential foodstuffsare being built up.(e) RegistrationThe Governor has decided to introduce a systemof registration in two stages(i) voluntary registration of persons at present on the-ration strength and of othersdesirous of being registered (estimatedtime -four months);(ii) compulsory registration (not until necessary).(f) Police 1The Police Force will be expanded to approxi-mately 80 per cent greater strength than 19M by31st March.&apos;    There should also be a certain numberof European civilians available as a trained reserve to reinforce senior Police Officers.      The presenttraining capacity of the depot is being used to thelimit and could not accommodate any further large increase.(g) StrikesThere is a possibility that a genuine industrial dispute may be used by the Communists to stir uptrouble.      Whether they would deliberately initiateindustrial and internal strife in the Colony would depend largely on their overall policy towards theColony and the British Empire generally.      Theirpresent action towards foreign interests in China in recent months-appears to indicate that they are unlikely to do so, but the danger may arise with little warning.      A scheme has been prepared forrunning the public utility services with volunteerlabour, since it is those services whose labourbelongs to Communist-controlled Unions.      The naval commander-in-Chief, Par East, has agreed to provide further man-power, when necessary, to assist in maintaining essential services.

7. . The above matters have all been reviewed here, where necessary, with the Chiefs of Staff Committee. . The following steps are also being taken:-(a) PoliceUrgent selection of a small additional numberof European Police Officers, required to bring thecommissioned personnel of the Hong Kong police force up to the necessary strength.(b) SuppliesSpecial efforts to ensure that,  as far aspossible, the necessary materials required by localindustries in Hong Kong are made available withoutdelay, to minimise possible discontent in industry.MALAYA; 8.      (a)    Security forces there are now over 14,000 Regular Police (anincrease of over 3j000 since June, 19*4-8) and theforce will have reached its planned permanent strengthof over 15,000 by June, 19*4-9*      In addition there are some 3,600 Extra Constables (mostly ex-regularpolicemen);    30,000 Special Constabulary (a paidfull-time force, mainly Malay, employed chiefly onstatic defence duties) and 19s000 part-time unpaidAuxiliary Police and village guards.The total number of British, Gurkha and Malayfighting troops stationed in the Federation of malaya and Singapore is 1i.(.,600.     Administrative troopstotal 26,800.      One Battalion of Gurkhas had to bereturned to Hong Kong in December.      A ThirdBattalion of the Malay Regiment has now completed its training and the recruitment of a FourthBattalion is to be started almost at once.(b)    Internal Security situation the High Commissioner estimates that the banditforces now consist of some hundreds of &quot;hard-coreCommunists&quot; aided by some thousands (probably notexceeding 5,000) of armed auxiliaries of various kinds.      Some 500 bandits have been killed (all but10 of them Chinese).The bandits have undoubtedly been forced to change their tactics owing to the operations of theSecurity Forces and have in the main now transferredtheir attentions from well defended targets to more vulnerable objectives.      Their r^resent campaignappears to be almost purely one of murder and thelarger bands have withdrawn more deeply into.the jungle, leaving behind small killer squads and spies.   -This disengagement may be only temporary and, infuture, other fields of operation,  such as thesabotage of power-lines, water supplies and bridges and attacks on Government targets may be more vigorouslyexploited.While the situation in certain districts con-tinues difficult and dangerous, the local authoritiesassure us that, taking the situation as a whole,there has been an overall improvement.      The peak of

bandit activity appears to have been reached inNovember when there were 278 attacks.      The figurefell to 232 in December and to 198 in January andthe decrease continued during February.      the monthly civilian fatal casualty rate was 31 inJanuary as opposed to a monthly average of 1+8 inJune/December.      Total civilian fatal casualties were 387 up to 21+th February, of whom 269 wereChinese and 30 European.(c) Siamese FrontierOne of the most difficult problems has been the case with which bandits could retire across thefrontier into Siam and subsequently recross intoMalaya.      The Siamese Government have all alongexpressed their willingness to co-operate and steps have been taken to translate this willingness into effective action.      Two conferences between Siameseand Malayan officials have recently been held and ajointly planned operation was carried out early inFebruary.      Although this achieved no spectacularresults, it is hoped that it marks an important step towards establishing a regular and direct liaison between the Security Forces on both sides of thefrontier.(d) Government action against BanditsThe main difficulty is that the mass of theChinese population, and in particular the &quot;squattersfor the most part illegal,settlers in areas borderingoh the jungle - has been unwilling or unable toco-operate actively with Government.      This is not because the Chinese are in sympathy with Communismor the bandits, but because they are so easilyintimidated into providing shelter, supplies and money and withholding information about banditmovements.The squatter problem is being vigorouslytackled.      Some squatters are being resettled in areas where they will be under close police super-vision.      Four of the worst areas have been dealtwith under a new Emergency Regulation which enables the High Commissioner to deport the inhabitants ofcertain areas ?/ho have persistently declined toco-operate with the Security Forces against thebandits.      These repatriations are being carried outwith humanity but with thoroughness.      During thefirst two months of this year, over 1,600 personshave been repatriated.      Compensation is paid foranimals that cannot be removed and the most careful investigation is made to see that relatives are giventhe opportunity of accompanying repatriates if they so wish.      This action has led,to more co-operationbetween the squatters and the authorities.      TheGovernment also has under urgent consideration con-structive proposals recently submitted by a FederalCommittee for the settlement of squatters on land and bringing the areas under proper administration and this holds out a real prospect for these peopleof an alternative to Communism.The payment of &quot;protection money&quot; by all sections of the Chinese community is still a dis-disturbing feature of the situation.      Resolute action is being taken against persons known to persist inpaying this blackmail;    some 300 detentions have

already been made.      The Government has also intro-duced National Registration and this is almostcompleted.      Powers have also been taken to declare&quot;closed areas&quot;.      The declaration of the first&quot;closed area&quot; produced immediate results in theform of volunteered information.      I should alsoadd that the High Commissioner is trying to awakenamong the Chinese a determination to resist theimpositions of the bandits;    various Chineseassociations have now come forward openly to denounce the payment of protection&apos; money and, stillmore important, a Malayan Chinese Association hasbeen formed on&apos; his initiative which has among itsobjects co-operation with the Government in restoring peace and in providing money and men tohelp in settling the squatters as peaceful citizens.3. Nevertheless, the European community, on whoseefforts the maintenance of the whole rubber and tin economy ofthe country depends, is feeling the effects of the strain anddanger.      There are constant -demands for more troops to besent.      The situation would be helped by a few spectacularsuccesses and more active collaboration of the Chinesecommunity;    otherwise it looks as if we are faced with a longstruggle of attrition.      All the help possible is being givento the planters and miners out it is difficult to see what additional assistance could relieve the strain to which theyare constantly subjected.&quot;10. A paper on the internal security and local defence forces required in Malaya is now before the Chiefs of staff and will form the basis of a report by the Minister of defence and myself to the Defence Committee.      The High Commissionerhas strongly represented that financial assistance from HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be necessary if the present scale ofpolice forces in Malaya is to be maintained and if the planned expansion of the Malay Regiment and other local defence forces is to go ahead;    and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreedthat substantial help must be forthcoming.      It is hoped thatthis expansion will in due course release part of the strategic reserve in the Par East for service in Hong Kong, if necessary,but it is unlikely that this could take place before the endof the year, at the earliest.11. I am confident that the High Commissioner will represent urgently to me any further powers he may need orassistance in men and materials as he may require..       I do notthink there are any further measures which can be taken inLondon to strengthen our position.A. C. J.Colonial Office, S.W.1.5TH MARCH,  1949.
