[IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s government)SECRET - COPY No3lCP. (49) 6824TH MARCH.  1949CABINETDEMOBILISATION CLOTHING FOR NATIONAL SERVICEMEN -Memorandum by the Minister of DefenceIntroduction,My Service colleagues and I have recently reviewed therelease &quot;benefits granted to National Service men called up in 1947 and 1948.   The present arrangements for thesemen, whose maximum period of service will vary between12 years 3 months and 18 months, were laid down as followsI by the Defence Committee in 1946 (D.0.(46) 35th Meeting):(i) Release leave with full pay and ration allowance at the rate of 1 day for each month of service;(ii) 60 supplementary clothing coupons;(iii) Retention of Service clothing to the extentof a pair of part-worn boots or shoes,shirt and tie, and vests, pants and socksin possession at the time of release;(iv) Permission to buy a. suit ofbattledress (for 32/-) and a Servicegreatcoat (for 38/9) if necessary.2.     The release benefits received by a man called up before 1947 and released under the &quot;age and service&quot;release scheme which is now almost completed were:-(i) 56 days release leave;- (ii) Overseas service leave (if earned);(iii) Complete civilian outfit, comprising suit,raincoat, hat, shirt, tie, pair of shoes, pairof cuff-links, 2 collars and 2 studs;(iv) 90 Supplementary clothing coupons.-

3.    Release in appreciable numbers of men called, upin 1947 and 1948 has only recently begun.   It is nowevident that, in spite of the publicity given to itat the time by the Service Departments and Ministryof Labour, the decision to stop issuing demobilisationclothing was not appreciated by many of those affecteduntil they were released, when it became the object of widespread resentment.   Many letters have been addressedto the Service Ministers and to myself from Members ofParliament and the public.   I have also had to answera number of Parliamentary Questions and on February 28ththe matter was the subject of an Adjournment debate in which speakers of all parties opposed the present policy and urged for all National Servicemen on releaseeither the continuation of free issues or a generouscash grant to cover the cost of civilian clothingpurchases privately.The case for the Present Policy&apos;4.    A clear distinction can be drawn between the&quot;age and service&quot; men and the 1947/48 entrants.   Thegenerous benefits of the &quot;age and service&quot; scheme were granted in recognition of long service in the v/ar years;the problem of resettlement in civil life was difficult;the men concerned -would certainly have had little chanceof finding any of their pre-war clothes still wearable;and clothing at the time was scarce.   The 1947/48entrants, on the other hand, were called up for fixedperiods of peacetime service in no case longer than twoyears and three months and in general considerably less;and clothing is no longer difficult to find.   A line can therefore be drawn between the two groups.   The existenceof an intermediate group (the men called up in 1946 but still under the war-time arrangements who served for periods not much longer than that now current and received the full &quot;age and service&quot; benefits) does notobscure this distinction.   It can also be argued that theNational Service man is given release leave on fullpay in proportion to his length of service;   and that itis no business of the Services to defray the normalexpenses incurred by men after they have been releasedinto civilian life and which would prooably have been incurred whetner they had been in the services or not.The Services cannot therefore undertake financialliability for the refitting of these men on their returnto.civilian life.The Case for a Concession5.    Critics of the Governments polioy argue that inthe course of his service the National Service manoutgrows his civilian clothes; that he cannot afford to save during his service for the clothes he will needwhen he is released;   and that it is therefore the dutyof the Services to provide him with clothes.   It is said

that most of the young men concerned, had they notbeen called up, would have been living at homeearning good wages and well able to providethemselves with civilian clothes.   Their call-up,apart from interfering with their careers, andeven in some cases with their chances of getting a reasonably good job before being called up,means that they get no more than 30/- or  2 a week for a long period and. although they are, inaddition, fed and clothed and accommodated by theServices, all their pay is taken up by theexpenses of Service life arising partly from thepresent lack of amenities, and also from suchspecial-factors as travelling expenses for visitingtheir parents.   Release leave, it is said, hasbeen earned by service, and in any event isintended to be spent as leave which is necessaryfor the purpose of resettlement.   Pay for this&apos;period is therefore for purposes of maintenance,and is not available for the purchase of clothing.These arguments are difficult to refute.Possible Concessions6.      My Service colleagues and I are agreed that,because of its cost both in money.and in administrativeoverheads (including personnel), we should not bejustified in continuing to grant a complete outfit -of civilian clothing on the &quot;age and service&quot; scale;also that a money grant sufficient to enable suchan outfit to be privately purchased would be too costly.We are however satisfied that there is a strong case for some concession and it is clear that, if noneis made, there will be a large and growing volumeof dissatisfaction.   This, by affecting recruiting,may well react on Service efficiency. &quot; &apos;7.      The suggestion has been made that men shouldbe allowed to retain without payment a suit ofbattledress and a Service greatcoat.   This would notbe a happy solution.   The Services need this clothing;it is expensive to replace;   there are militaryobjections to civilians wearing it.   Finally, the concession would cost a considerable sum withoutsatisfying the main complaint.8.      There remain^ two forms in which a concession could be made.   First, by the provision of a modifiedscale of civilian clothing, and secondly, by means ofa cash &apos;grant in aid&apos; which would go at any rate someway towards meeting the cost of civilian clothesprivately purchased.   We have rejected the first solution,mainly because it would&apos;involve the Services in a continuing and onerous.administrative commitment.   Wetherefore propose that a cash grant of  5 towards theprovision of civilian clothing should be given on

release to all National&apos; Service men called up&apos;after 1st January, 1947.This sum, will not, of course, cover thefull cost of a civilian outfit and we shall probably be urged to increase it.   We shall haveto make it plain that the sum is intended to beno more than a &quot;grant in aid&apos; and, on the argumentsset out in paragraph 4, maintain that the claims of the post-1947 National Service men in this mattercannot reasonably be equated with those of men called up during the war.   We think we can hold this position.9.      The proposed concession would, it is true,involve a heavy and continuing charge to ServiceVotes.   The cost in the next financial year would,indeed be over  Ml.   The cost in subsequent years would be lower.The views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer10.    The Chancellor the&apos;Exchequer is very dubiousabout the merits of this proposal.   In his view itis questionable whether in the main these men willbe unable to make use of their civilian clothingon their return to civil life.   He thinks it isalso problematical whether, once the Government have accepted the principle of providing NationalService men with civilian clothing on discharge, agrant of  5 for this purpose would be accepted assufficient.   There might well be demands for thegrant to be increased to  15 or even  20.   Thiswould bring the total cost up to fi3M or  4Ma year.   The Chancellor points out also that thesum of  760M allocated for defence for the year1949/50 is already a very large slice out of thenational income.   He is strongly opposed to anyaddition to this total -sum in respect of the cost ofa civilian clothing provision for National Service men.If, therefore, the Cabinet decide to approve my proposal in principle he considers that it should be strictly conditional upon the cost being met from within the provision already made in 1949/50 Estimates,i.e. by a corresponding reduction in the cost ofsome other projected service./

Conclusion11.     It is I am afraid quite clear that there is no present prospect of savings being made in the service estimates for 1949 (which have.only just tv-en approved)which would enable the Service Ministers to accept here and now the Chancellors stipulation that the cost ofany.concessions in this matter should be met within thetotal of Service Estimates in the coming year.Nevertheless, after careful consideration, the service ministers and I feel that, some assistance for national Service men on release in the provision of civilian clothing is justified and we ask the Cabinetto agree to a grant or  5 to each man for this purpose.A.V.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1.24th March, 1949.   .
