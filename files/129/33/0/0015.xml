this document is  the property of his britannic majesty&apos;8 government-     74Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1949SECRET&apos; Copy No.     31CP. (40) 588th March, 1949 - &apos;,CABINETTEIPOLITANIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for WarThe problem as our colleagues will recall, the proposals set forth in CP. (46) 354 for- theintroduction of certain administrative measures in Cyrenaica with a view toconvincing the inhabitants of our interest in their well-being and progress towards self-government were approved by the Cabinet on 26th September, 1946 (CM. (46)83rd Conclusion, Minute 4), and a working party, under the aegis of the WarOffice and led by Sir Bernard Reilly, visited the territory in December 1946 and January 1947, in accordance with the Cabinefs decision. In the same paper thehope was expressed that a similar working party would also be able to visitTripolitania. A working party did in fact visit Tripolitania, but with more limited terms of reference than those of the working party for Cyrenaica: its recommendations were correspondingly limited. It had, moreover, been decided by the Cabinet that as regards Tripolitania no change in our administrative policy should be made. Consequently, the policy of &quot; care and maintenance &quot; which wasconsiderably modified in Cyrenaica, has been maintained in Tripolitania. Theresult has been that the inhabitants of the latter territory, in contrast to those of cyrenaica, have gained the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government have littleinterest in their well-being or future.2. In August 1948 Sir Noel Charles made a statement before the Deputiesin the Council of Foreign Ministers to the effect that if no decision were taken as regards the final disposal of Tripolitania, and His Majesty&apos;s Government were asked to continue to administer the territory as a caretaker, they would desire tobe freed from the limitations imposed by the Hague Conventions and to replace the military by a civil administration, and with this change to introduce a seriesof reforms.3. The failure of the Council of Foreign Ministers and of the general assembly of the United Nations in September and December last year to settle the disposal of the Italian Colonies has further increased the anxiety of theTripolitanians about their future.4. Our policy towards the territory is at present under review. If it wereto be decided to agree to the territory returning to Italian administration, and ifthe Assembly agreed, our responsibility would then end in the course of next summer; it is, on the other hand, also possible that our policy will remain one of postponement and that the General Assembly in April will vote in this sense.In the latter case the exigencies of the local political situation would be such asto require us to initiate immediately the programme of development outlined bySir Noel Charles. Such a programme requires careful preparation and could notin practice take effect before approximately six months after it had been agreedhere. In the case of Cyrenaica the recommendations of the working party referredto in paragraph 1 of this memorandum were a necessary preliminary to the rapidimplementation of a similar programme. We are therefore of the opinion thatif, as we believe, it is now necessary to plan for the contingency that we may have36692
to continue to administer Tripolitania for a further period, a working party should be sent to the&apos;te&apos;rritory:and that its terms of reference should be as wideas those of the Cyrenaican working party of 1947. This new working party should review the situation in the light of developments within the last two yearsand should consider to what extent the recommendations of 1947 should beextended and brought up to date. -   ; -5. In connection with the future of Tripolitania, our colleagues w^ill recall that on 20th January this year (CM. (49) 5th Conclusion, Minute 4) the cabinet approved a proposal contained in CP. (49) 12 that the administrative responsi-bility for the territory, together with that for Cyrenaica, should b.e transferred from the War Office to the Foreign Office as soon as the necessary arrangements could be made. These arrangements are now in hand and the date upon whichresponsibility should be transferred is under consideration.RecommendationWe therefore recommend that the Cabinet should approve the setting up ofa working party for Tripolitania under the leadership of an experienced admin-istrator such as was Sir b. Reilly and its despatch to the territory in the imme-diate future. We also recommend that our colleagues approve the draft termsof reference for this working party which are annexed to this memorandum;.e. b.Iffi       &apos; &apos;:&apos;    - &apos; &apos;SXt&apos;8th March, 1949annex :Terms of Reference for Working Party on TripolitaniaThe Working Party shall, in consultation with the Chief Administratorand other officers of the administration, review the situation in Tripolitania inthe. light of the developments during the last two years and make recommendations for social, administrative, economic and constitutional measures designed to benefit the inhabitants of Tripolitania.
