THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 19419 secret Copy No.  31CP. (49) 6921st March, 1949CABINETUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural OrganisationTHIRD GENERAL conference memorandum by the Minister of education. I circulate herewith a proof copy of the Report of the United kingdom delegation to the Third General Conference of UNESCO (Beirut, 17thNovember-llth December, 1948).2. The Report is in two parts, an introductory report to me by the membersof the United Kingdom Delegation, and a more general survey of the programme and budget of the Organisation, its administrative problems and external relations,as they were left after discussion by the Conference. The aim has been to providea reasonably full factual survey in the light of which the official records of theConference may be more readily understood by those interested in the Organisa-tion. On grounds of economy, the programme, budget, miscellaneous resolutionsand other official documents of the Conference have been omitted from the Reportthis year. These are being printed by UNESCO and will be available in thiscountry through His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office.3. UNESCO, now in its third year, has a staff of just over 600 and anannual budget of $7,780,000 ( 1,935,323) compared with $7,682,637 in 1948. TheUnited Kingdom share of this will be 13-55 per cent, or  256,857 payable in sterling convertible only into French francs. The United States contribution,payable in dollars, will be 38. 47 per cent. The United Kingdom took the lead atBeirut in pressing for economy and efficiency, and $700,000 was clipped from thebudget originally proposed for 1949. By securing that small-scale GeneralConferences held at headquarters in Paris should alternate with the fullerConferences which revise the programme, the United Kingdom Delegationachieved future savings both for the Organisation and for Member States.4. The Report of the United Kingdom Delegation to the General Conferencesoffers the best means of providing the public and Parliament with an annualstocktaking of the Organisation and I hope that my colleagues will agree to its being printed now and in future as a Command Paper.G.

The United Kingdom Delegation to the Third Session ofthe General Conference of the United Nations Educational,Scientific and Cultural OrganisationREPORTTo the Right Honourable George Tomlinson, M.P..Minister of EducationSir,During September and October, 1948, you appointed us as the. UnitedKingdom Delegation to the Third Session of the General Conference of theUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. that conference was held in Beirut, Lebanon, from 17th November to llthDecember, 1948, and we now submit the following report upon its work.2. Delegations frorh thirty-seven of the forty-four mehiber States of UNESCO attended the Conference. Notable absentees were Delegations from poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The Polish Government explainedthat, as diplomatic relations between Poland and the Lebanon did not exist,it was unable to send a delegation. The Governments of the other twocountries gave no reasons for not attending.3. In our opinion the organisation of the Conference showed a marked improvement over the two earlier Conferences. All the items on a heavyagenda were considered and the Conference completed its work within theallotted time. The official proceedings of the Conference, including allthe programme, administrative and financial resolutions adopted, have been published in full by UNESCO. * For this reason, we confine ourselves inPart II of this Report to a summary account of the main decisions takenby the Conference.*        *        *        *        *        *        *4. We would like first to comment upon the general development of theorganisation, its programme and the very real dimculties it is encounteringind, to a remarkable extent, overcoming. The Secretariat of UNESCO hasbeen gradually developing the various techniques necessary for translatingthe Constitution and the decisions of General Conferences into appropriatemd adequate action. The Department of Education has now evolved atvell-organised plan of work and we have been favourably impressed withhat of the Department of Natural Sciences. The latter may perhaps beegarded as a prototype and we. think it worth describing in some detail,ts central conception is that of a clearing house, its most effective action)eing the stimulation of action in other more/feraaal organisations, and the&apos;)revision of such aid as may lie needed. As other departments of UNESCO&apos;sSecretariat should be, it is therefore in touch with (a) Governments, throughts Department of External Relations, (6) National Commissions, whichepresent the bodies concerned with education, science and culture in theseveral Member States ; (c) Regions of the world, which may include several:countries, through UNESCO&apos;s own field and regional offices, such as theour Field Service Co-operation Offices; (d) International Governmental* Records of the General Conference of UNESCO, Third Session, Volume II Resolutions,I.M. Stationery Office, price Qs, Od,
Organisations such as its sister agencies in the United Nations or the smaller,more specialised bodies such as the International Institute of the HyleanAmazon, or the proposed International Institute of the Arid Zone ; (e) Inter-national semi or non-governmental organisations which direct financial assist-ance from UNESCO can strengthen and develop or even create, as in thecase of the newly formed International Union for the Protection of Nature;if) Individuals throughout the world who alone can ensure that UNESCO,while it remains an inter-governmental agency, maintains a living relation-ship with experts throughout the world who are in a position to give valuableadvice to the Organisation as well as to receive it.5. Such in outline are the means whereby UNESCO can carry out itstask. It must work wherever possible through the National commissions and Member Governments since it is through them that it derives its mainsupport. But it is, and must be, in touch with men of light and learning in countries which are not yet Member States; it has taken into its Secretariatcitizens of such countries and, in addition, through the international non-governmental, semi-governmental and governmental organisations, it has ameasure of collaboration from practically every country in the world.*        *        *        *        *        *        *6. Over the past two years there has been an improvement in the planning of the UNESCO programme. That programme must be judged as a whole.New and urgent tasks may be suggested for inclusion in it, and we have studied all available advice and criticism in. search of suggestions as to whatought to have been done but has not been done. We have found none thatis not included in one form or another in the present programme. At thesame time we have examined critically many new proposals which seemed&apos; to us, and to the General Conference, to be insufficiently urgent for inclusion.At the outset, the Leader of the United Kingdom Delegation urged the Con-ference when it considered new proposals not to be afraid to say &quot;no&quot;merely because no good reason could be urged against them. While theUnited Kingdom Delegation recognised that a wide programme was neces-sary in order to secure the co-operation of as many workers as possible inthe wide field of education, science and culture, our readiness to broadenUNESCO&apos;s programme was tempered by the sense that within each of the many legitimate fields of activity a strict spirit of economy in the use of limited resources must prevail.7. The deficiencies in unescos programme will remain a standing chal-lenge to teachers in schools, to university lecturers and professors, to scientists,artists, writers, philosophers, psychologists and social workers generallythroughout the world. The programme of UNESCO will be what they make it. In considering the programme which the Conference finally approved,our own criticism as a Delegation has been and remains severe in certain matters. While we think that the most fruitful work has been, and will bedone in the fields of Education, Natural Sciences, Libraries and the Exchangeof Persons, other fields appear to us to have developed less satisfactorily andto promise less certain results.9. Bearing in mind the great needs of educational, scientific and culturalreconstruction and the appreciable contribution towards meeting those needswhich the United Kingdom was able to make through the Lord Mayor&apos;s appeal for Children, we regret that owing to its inadequate resources thereconstruction programme of UNESCO has not measured up to -the expecta-tions it aroused, still less to the immense problems still before it,  Jt,seems
Svident that this part of unescos work has not succeeded in capturing thepagination of the world and that voluntary agencies have not used UNESCOs a channel for large sums that they are believed to be providing forducational reconstruction.10. In Communication, a field which United Kingdom Delegations have[always considered as offering great opportunities for the reduction of ignor-jance and prejudice through broadcasting, film and Press, we can record only[limited progress.   In both Reconstruction and Communication clear and[concrete objectives have been selected, but difficulties have been found in[developing with the necessary speed and on the necessary scale the methods[needed to achieve them.  Nor are we sure that these methods are likely tobe recognised and developed in the immediate future.  This fact is the more serious since it is in these two fields that the needs are greatest and effective action could do most to reassure a distressed world that an inter-govern-mental organisation for education, science and cultures is a force which notonly raises problems but can solve them.11. In the remaining programme fields it is not possible to say with con-viction that general aims have yet been successfully translated into practicalobjectives. In Arts and Letters and in Philosophy and Humanistic Studies,if, has not been possible to draw up co-ordinated programmes of work of thesame importance and urgency as in the other fields. It is evident thatthese subjects are difficult to organise internationally. Two isolated examples,[however, of international co-operation successfully developed throughUNESCO suggests that at least these particular programme fields are capableof effective development and that their present difficulties can be overcome[with experience. These are the International Theatre Institute and the Inter-national Council of Philosophical and Humanistic Societies. Nevertheless,[we must record our uneasiness at the lack of balance of the present pro-gramme. It has, for example, made it impossible since in no field canmoney be voted except for projects of first rate importance, to achieve an even distribution of funds between the several fields of UNESCOactivities.12. The balance between the various aspects of the Organisation^ workseems to us to be a matter of exceptional importance. It requires the deepestconsideration which national delegations can bring to the problfem and the    -most constructive criticisrnjef individual and national opinion. We are aware * ^of the criticisms that can be, and have been, levelled at UNESCO.   Instudying those criticisms, we are confirmed in our belief that no one openlychallenges the high purposes and fundamental aims for which this inter-national organisation exists.  The best informed criticism has generally been concerned with the need to translate the general aims and purposes of theOrganisation into concrete objectives which offer hopes of practical achieve-ment. As we have said this criticism has already been met in some of the fields for which UNESCO is responsible, and particularly in those of^ ji^JLEducation and the Natural Sciences. The Programme approved by the Third n^\^Session of the General Conference/provides a body of concrete and worth- ptjjiil,while activities which, when carried out, will make a direct contribution to0.22*2international understanding and social welfare. *su*AJ*^, -13. The problem in our view is primarily no longer what to do but how best it can be done. A number of practical objectives have now been worked out which are in line with the general purpose of UNESCO described in its Constitution. It is in trying to reach these objectives on a world scalethat a new set of problems has been raised, more complex and more urgentthan the initial problems of converting general aims into particular tasks.
It is at this level that we specially welcome public criticism and professionaladvice, and it is here that we think that the United Kingdom National Coin-mission will provide an invaluable and representative concensus of Britishopinion.*******14. We must also report upon matters other than those concerning theprogramme. There has been criticism about the administration of theOrganisation and about the laxity of financial control. We think it necessaryto emphasise what you have already reported in the House of commons that the loss sustained in 1945 through the dishonesty of a temporaryemployee occurred before the Organisation was established, in the days ofthe Preparatory Commission, and that it was detected and corrected in 1946.There have also been allegations that the members of the Secretariat are paid abnormally high salaries. After the most careful study of these mattersat the Third Session of the General Conference, we affirm without hesitationthat, whatever faults we found, they were not faults of a careless administra-tion. The United Kingdom Delegation, however, disapproved strongly ofthe system of administration which it found in force, particularly of therigid division in function and responsibility between administrative and pro-gramme personnel. We secured almost unanimous support for a resolutionrequesting the Director-General to examine critically the organisation ofthe staff and to take steps to ensure that heads of programme departments,properly invested with privileges of high rank and salary, should carry acorresponding measure of authority and responsibility for administrative andfinancial control of their own departments. A substantial reduction in thenumbers of staff at present carrying out purely administrative duties andin the funds necessary to employ them should follow.15. We examined with care the financial control of the Organisation^Funds and found no trace of irresponsible expenditure or careless accounting.The Auditors Report was entirely satisfactory. We considered that theadministration of funds was sometimes, if anything, too tightly controlled,with the result that programme activities were held up because of the slowrelease of funds. We believe that if the resolution referred to above iseffectively carried out, it will go some way to make control more flexiblewithout reducing its efficiency.16. The Conference examined the salary and allowance rates of the staff inrelation to the high cost of living in Paris, to the rates paid to members ofthe Secretariat of the United Nations and other Specialised Agencies, and tothose paid in many diplomatic missions in Paris. As a result we are ableto report that we share the view of the Conference that unescos salaryscales are not too high. In saying this we do not wish to be regarded assupporting the entire system of grading posts for the various salary ratesat present in force. We are, however, conscious of the need to offerattractive rates of salary if people of high quality are to be induced to acceptthe uncertainties and other conditions of international service, for we are well aware that even when attractive salary scales are offered it still remainsexceedingly difficult to secure staff.* * * * * * *17. In order to carry out the programme of work and to maintain thenecessary administrative services, a Budget of  2,107,826 was proposed tothe Conference. These estimates were scrutinised with very great care andthe United Kingdom Delegation took upon itself the task of pressing for substantial reductions in the proposed total. We are now able to reportthat the Conference finally approved a Budget of  1,935,323. This represents
a saving of  171,503 over the proposed figure. The United Kingdom cootri-bution to the Budget was fixed at 13.55 per cent., and will amount to 256,857.* * * * * * *18. In reviewing the work of the Conference, and despite the earlieropposition of His Majesty&apos;s Government and our own misgivings, we arein no doubt about the value of having held this meeting of scholars, scientists and,educators in a small and distant country. We believe that a vivid and permanent impression of the Organisation^ work has been left upon theMiddle East. When we consider that last year the Second Session held inMexico City had a similar influence upon the Latin American continent,the policy of holding the General Conference in each of the last two years in a different country seems to have been a wise and valuable one. But we and many other delegations felt concern over the demands that such a policymade upon the private time of delegates, the funds of Governments and theresources of the Secretariat. We, therefore, took the lead in securing generalagreement that the General Conference should be held alternately one year as a small business conference to conduct necessary financial and administra-tive arrangements and the following year as a full scale meeting of repre-sentatives of education, science and culture from every Member State.This new policy will take immediate effect and the Fourth Session will beheld in Paris in 1949 as a small business meeting, but with an opportunityto debate one or two topics of an urgent character.1 ^ SJC ^ Sjfi 5(C19. In conclusion, and with recognition of what the Third Session did and did not achieve, we can report that this Conference was a successful andheartening instance of international collaboration. Inter-governmental actionin the political and economic fields has long been established. There existtraditional procedures, acknowledged techniques and a recognised language of statement and understanding. Inter-governmental action in the fields ofeducation, science and culture has developed almost entirely during the last ten to fifteen years. UNESCO, the most important and ambitious instru-ment of such action, is just two years old. In many ways we are not far enough away from our own experience to be able to assess at its propervalue the Organisation which has developed so rapidly or to set forth an accurate balance sheet of its strength and weaknesses. It was, however, this very task that the Third Session attempted, and, we are prepared to say,achieved in some measure. We believe that control is exercised over the funds entrusted to the Organisation by governments, that there is no extrava-gance in the use of appropriated funds, and that the proper regulations andrules of procedure to ensure order and efficiency in any new instrument ofinternational planning are now firmly established. In programme activities,we feel that new and valuable work, based as it will be upon sounderadministrative lines, can now go forward towards discovering those techniqueswhich are needed to convert plans and projects into jobs done.20. It seems to us that this is a most appropriate moment in the develop-ment of the Organisation for the appointment of a new Director-General.We express our warm satisfaction at the election of Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet,formerly Foreign Minister of Mexico, to the post of chief administrativeofficer. At the same time we cannot omit from our Report an expression of our gratitude for the distinguished service which an Englishman, Dr. Julian7
Huxley, has given during the first two years of unescos existence as its first Director-General. In doing so we are echoing not only the words ofthe Leader of our own Delegation, but the unanimous voice of the conference as a whole, whose tribute to the outstanding achievement of Dr. Huxley in creating, building, enlarging and sustaining the Organisation in its first andmost difficult formative years, lacked nothing in sincerity or enthusiasm.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants,D. R. Hardman, M.P. (Leader).Ronald Adam (Delegate).W. E. Houstoun-Boswall (Delegate),John P. R, Maud (Delegate).Harold Spencer-Jones (Delegate).W. P. Alexander (Alternate Delegate),R. Gould (Alternate Delegate).Alan Moorehead (Alternate Delegate).Ronald Syme (Alternate Delegate).J. Needham (Alternate Delegate).
PART II1. introduction. Organisation of the Conference. At the Second Session of the Genera!&quot;Conference held in Mexico City in 1947, it was decided, in accordance with therequirements of the Constitution, that the Third Session should be held inthe territory of one of the Member States but not at the Headquarters of theOrganisation in Paris as the United Kingdom Delegation and others had urged. An offer by the Lebanese Government was accepted and on 17thNovember, 1948, the Third Session opened in Beirut. After holding 19plenary meetings and 63 meetings of Commissions and Sub-Commissions,,the Conference ended, as planned, on 11th December.2. The General Conference established three major Commissions: A Pro-gramme and Budget Commission, an Administrative Commission, and anOfficial and External Relations Commission. The Programme and Budget.Commission established the following Sub-Commissions: Sub-Commissions,of the whole on Reconstruction, Education, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences,.Cultural Questions, Exchange of Persons, Communication, and a Budget Sub-Commission of 10 members, of which Sir Ronald Adam (United Kingdom)-was chairman. In addition, the necessary Committees of the Conference were set up: a General Committee, a Credentials Committee, a Procedures Com-mittee and a Nominations Committee. A special committee of 15 was also-established to deal with certain miscellaneous items.3. The Conference elected M. Hamid Bey Frangie, Foreign Minister ofLebanon as its President, and as Vice-Presidents, Senator Molinari (Argentine),.M. Victor Dore (Canada), Dr. King Chu (China), M. Georges Bidault (France),Senator Count Jaqini (Italy), M. Husseyin Cahit Yalcin (Turkey), and Mr.George V. Allen (United States of America). Professor Paulo Carneiro was-elected Chairman of the Programme and Budget Safe-Commission ; Mr. A. A.Roberts (South Africa) Chairman of the Administrative Commission, andMr. D. R. Hardman, M.P. (United Kingdom) Chairman of the Official and external Relations Commission.4. Delegates and Observers. Delegations from the 37 Member States listed in Appendix I were present. The United States Delegation was the largestand numbered about 50. The Lebanese Delegation numbered 35 ; the Syrian25 ; the Egyptian 17. The Arab States were therefore strongly represented.In contrast, there were only small delegations from the commonwealth countries. India, however, had 12 representatives, only three less than France.The United Kingdom Delegation was 22 strong. A list of its members,appears in Appendix II.5. Observers were present from certain non-Member States (Ireland,.Monaco, Pakistan, Siam, Sweden, Switzerland, Transjordan, the Vatican and yugoslavia) and from the United Nations and several of the specialised agencies (The International Labour Office, the World Health Organisationand the International Refugee Organisation). The Conference, by specialresolution, admitted as observers the representatives of 36 non-governmental organisations. The debate on the admission of these representatives of non-governmental organisations was the first of the Conference and it raised issues,of a political nature. The Arab States objected to the presence of observers,from Jewish organisations. Many delegations, including the United Kingdom,were quick to point out not only that the Constitution of the Organisation.9
laid down the fundamental right of all people to associate with each other,without distinction of race or creed, but also that the General conference had approved in principle the right of all non-governmental organisations whohad been granted consultative arrangements with UNESCO to send observersto its General Conferences. The Jewish organisations in question had beengranted consultative status and therefore had a right to send observers. Inthe event, however, they refrained from sending representatives. A corn-promise resolution was consequently possible which admitted observers only from those organisations which were present at the seat of the Conference.6. Organisation of the United Kingdom. In order to represent its views atthe various commissions and sub-commissions, the United Kingdom Delegation-was organised as follows:  Leader of the Delegation Mr. D. R. Hardman, M.P.United Kingdom Representative on the General Committee Mr. D. R.Hardman, M.P.United Kingdom Representative on the Executive Board Sir JohnMaud.Chief Adviser to Delegation Sir John Maud.Diplomatic Adviser Mr. W. E. Houston-Boswall.Reconstruction Commission Sir Ronald Adam, Mr. B. B. Thomas,Dr. J. Needham.Education Commission Mr. R. Gould, Dr. W. P. Alexander, MissJ. M. Lawson, Mr. W. E. F. Ward, Mr. T. T. Solaru, Mr. J. G. M. Allcock.Natural Sciences Commission Sir H. Spencer-Jones, Dr. J. Needham.Social Sciences Commission Mr. F. R. Cowell, Mr. R. Syme.Cultural Commission Sir Leigh Ashton, Mr. R. Syme.Communication Commission Mr. A. Moorehead, Sir John Maud,Mr. W. D. Pile.Exchange of Persons Commission Mr. R. Gould, Miss J. M. Lawson,Mr. W. D.

Cowell.Credentials Committee Mr. F. R. Cowell.Nominations Committee Mr. D. R. Hardman, M.P.Procedures Committee Mr. W. D. Pile.7. Election of Director-General. No item on the Agenda of the conference was more important than the appointment of a new Director-General to succeed Dr. Julian Huxley whose term of office had, at the First Session ofthe General Conference in 1946 at Dr. Huxley&apos;s own request, been limited to two years. The Executive Board, after prolonged consideration, proposed tothe Conference the name of Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet. This nomination was accepted by thirty votes to three. We would like here to add to our earlierexpression of satisfaction that the Organisation has fortunately been able toplace at its head a distinguished educational leader and an experiencedadministrator. Scholar, poet and diplomat, Dr. Torres Bodet has beenMinister of Education and was, until his appointment at the age of 48 as director-General of UNESCO for the next six years, Foreign Minister of theGovernment of Mexico.
2. THE PROGRAMME OF UNESCO8. Introduction. As set out in the pages which follow, the Programmeof UNESCO is to be regarded as an enumeration of activities which themajority of its Member States considered to be suitable, and at the sametime the most desirable, for intemational/pafpeses in the fields of education,a ^science and culture. They are moreover projects deemed to be within the limited financial resources of the Organisation or to be fit objects of national expenditure by Member States.9. The fact that they were adopted in their present form by majoritydecision of the General Conference invests them with some considerable measure of authority which every Member State should respect, whetheror not it found itself in a minority on any particular resolution. As far as.possible therefore, Member States will be expected to aid the Secretariat, andto invite the co-operation of their National Commissions in implementing theProgramme.10. The Conference at Beirut was the thud opportunity Member states have had, to consider and to define the Programme of the Organisation..In the opinion of the United Kingdom Delegation it is now much improved.Nevertheless the novelty of the task before UNESCO and the short time ithas had to consider it, inevitably make the Programme a working documentsubject to .revision in the light of further experience. For this reason wewere glad that the Conference adopted a recommendation that &quot; the Execu-tive Board should ensure that a careful study be made of these resolutionsto ensure greater clarity and conciseness in the Programme presented to theFourth General Conference.&quot;11. The Programme Commission did not attempt to consider every item in,the Programme. It deliberately restricted itself to certain selected items,which it felt to be of special importance or which had reached a stage-,requiring the direction of the General Conference. In addition, of course,,it had to consider many new proposals, but there remained the difficulty that large sections of the Programme were not subject to close examination. It.was felt that these activities were for the most part of a continuing nature,which must remain in the Programme but did not need examination.12. Furthermore we would point out that the Conference took an excep-tionally important decision in deciding that the Programme of Unescocould never be related to or be carried out within the space of any one year.It now stands, therefore, as a continuing programme for several years to come,within which each General Conference will single out year by year the objec-tives to which it wishes to give priority and funds.13. The arrangement of the Programme differs from that of earlier years..Largely on the advice of the United Kingdom Delegation, a more logicalorder of chapters has been introduced. First there is Reconstruction, whichwill always remain first so long as the extraordinary effects of war-devastationremain. There follow then, in the order in which the title of UNESCO itselfcarries them, chapters on Education (including Fundamental Education),Natural Sciences and Social Sciences, Philosophical and Humanistic Studies,and Cultural Activities (the latter including Arts, Letters, Museums, andLibraries) and finally the chapter which deals with the problems and mediacommon to all other activities of UNESCO, that on Communications (includ-ing Film, Radio and Press, and the Exchange of Persons).14. The following paragraphs give short accounts of the major decisions,taken by the Conference under each chapter of the Programme.
CHAPTER I.-RECONSTRUCTION15. Reconstruction Campaign. These resolutions instruct the Director-General to ensure the continuance of the reconstruction campaign begun in1946. UNESCO itself is not a relief agency and it does not itself organisecollections of funds or materials. It achieves its object by assisting member states and voluntary bodies to do this and, where this work is done atnational levels, it seeks to co-ordinate effort between them, preventing over-lapping and directing attention to the areas of greatest need. There aretherefore several resolutions calling for the provision by UNESCO of basicinformation on needs and of suitable publicity and campaign material illus-trating those needs. To help co-ordinate and direct the vast volume o  aidwhich the voluntary bodies are already providing, authority has been givento continue the work of the Temporary International Council for EducationalReconstruction (TICER), a body representing the main international non-governmental aid organisations. Member States themselves are asked tosupport this campaign, by co-ordinating their own national efforts, by form-ing reconstruction committees of their National Commissions and by arrang-ing for duty-free entry of contributed educational materials.16. Intellectual Refugees and Educational Building. Two resolutions which fall within this section are concerned with two of the most serioussocial problems of today ; the first, the employment of the 40,000 intellectualrefugees who remain as the hard core of the last one million displaced personsstill under the care of the International Refugee Organisation; the second,the provision of buildings and equipment for schools and universities toreplace war damage and to provide for an increasing world birthrate.17. Co-ordination with United Nations. In all this work care has beentaken to ensure co-ordination with the United Nations and its specialised agencies. In 1948, it was possible to combine in several countries theUNESCO campaign for educational reconstruction with the United NationsAppeal for Children. A joint appeal was possible in the cause of the physical and mental needs of children. In 1949, this co-ordination will be very muchmore difficult since the United Nations have resolved to limit their appealto the physical needs of children. A serious responsibility lies therefore, notonly upon UNESCO, but also upon the United Nations InternationalChildren&apos;s Emergency Fund, to ensure that the generosity of nations and of voluntary societies is not taxed with two major world-wide appeals in oneyear.18. Direct Emergency Aid. While there have been emergency needs in educational, scientific and cultural reconstruction, UNESCO has been autho-rised to spend some of its budgetary funds on direct purchase and distributionof equipment and materials. In 1947 the sum spent in this way was$360,000; in 1948, $310,000. The Conference again recommended continu-ance of this aid, but on a reduced scale. In 1949 only $175,000 have been allocated for this purpose. This reduction was counterbalanced by the in-creased importance given to international voluntary youth camps, whichthe Director-General was charged with sponsoring and assisting wherever possible in 1949.19. From Reconstruction to Construction. It was not only in the diminish-ing figure allocated to emergency reconstruction purchases nor in the in-creasing importance attached to activities such as youth camps where new and constructive work is being planned and executed by the world&apos;s youththat the United Kingdom Delegation detected the emergence of a new policy.Many delegations openly advocated a reduction in the scope of the aid paid
for from UNESCO Y limited budget for reconstruction of the war-devastatedcountries. The exclusive requirements of the war-devastated countries were now, they argued, being challenged by the even vaster needs of the un-developed and underprivileged communities of the world. The need to raisestandards was as great as the need to restore standards, and the horizons of fundamental education reached further than those of reconstruction. TheConference shared this belief and adopted a resolution proposed by theUnited Kingdom Delegation, recommending that &quot;UNESCO will in future years effect a gradual transition from the reconstruction of war-devastatedareas to constructive development Of education, science and culture&quot; andinstructing the Director-General to consider in 1949 the methods by whichthis transition can be made.CHAPTER II.-EDUCATION20. Clearing House in General Education. The policy and programme in education has now been built round the simple function of serving as a clearing-house &quot;for the collection, analysis and distribution of information,for expert counsel and for the exchange of materials and personnel between member States.&quot; This policy cannot be effectively implemented merely bythe collecting of facts in Unesco House or by answering questions bycorrespondence. A clearing house is not primarily an information bureau.Its main purpose is to ensure that educational experience and developments in one part of the world are made readily available in other parts which need them. In short, it is concerned with the cross fertilisation of educa-tional ideas and practice between nations.21. Educational Missions and Seminars. To accomplish this purpose,several techniques are being developed. The first is that of educational(missions, whereby experts and advisers from one country or group of countries will be sent direct to any country who requests help to develop itseducational system. Missions are already being sent to Afghanistan andthe Philippines. Another method is that of educational seminars. In 1949,one seminar is to be arranged in the Far East and assistance will be givento a second in Latin America on measures to combat mass-illiteracy. Pre-reparations are also authorised for two seminars in 1950, possible on the teaching of geography and the revision of text-books. The United kingdom delegation, while it strongly supported the use of educational missions, wasobliged to oppose the proposals concerning seminars originally put forward by the French and American Delegations, who would have preferred severalmore to be held in 1949. It was our belief that seminars are a new tech-nique, costly both in money and time, and we wished to study more carefully the results of those already held before authorising more. The resolution adopted was therefore a compromise between differing views.22. Fundamental Education. Based upon this policy of a clearing house-function, and using it as one of its central features, is the programme of fundamental education. The subjects with which this clearing house infundamental education will deal are in the nature of a definition of the scopeof fundamental education ; visual aids, language teaching methods, libraries,,indigenous arts, rural small-scale industries, health and hygiene, agriculture,and the conservation of natural resources.23. Pilot Projects. As testing grounds or nurseries where the process;of cross fertilisation may be nurtured and developed under actual conditions,,pilot projects in fundamental education remain as important activities in theprogramme. But they are limited to those in Haiti, China, Peru and BritishEast Africa.   Experience has brought home to delegates that UNESCO
cannot and ought not to try to run large, expensive and complicated schemesof fundamental education &quot; on the ground.&quot; These projects remain for whatthey are, pilot projects, and should any of them prove to be impossible to run as such, the Director-General is authorised to discontinue them.24. Education for International Understanding. Special attention is paidto education for international understanding. The two competitions for children will be completed this year. Studies and the distribution of materialwill continue on teaching about the United Nations and preparations are authorised for the drafting of a convention under which Member Statesmust ensure that their educational programmes are directed at all levelstowards international peace and security.25. Teachers&apos; Charter and Youth Charter. These resolutions, which havebeen in the programme of UNESCO for two years, did not seem to theUnited Kingdom Delegation to be of outstanding urgency. Nevertheless,they were accepted by the majority of the delegations. One calls upon theInternational Bureau of Education to collect basic material on the status of the teacher with a view to the drafting of a Teachers&apos; Charter. The otherinstructs the Director-General to promote an international study of thebarriers to education for all looking towards an educational charter for youth.26. Work with Universities and Adult Education. An important resolu-tion was passed charging UNESCO with assisting the development of aninternational organisation of representatives of Universities. Such an organi-sation was foreseen at the Utrecht Conference and steps have already beentaken towards its establishment.27. The main decision in the field of adult education was to authorisethe calling of a world conference for workers and leaders in adult education,including workers in industry and agriculture. The United Kingdom Delega-tion would have preferred to have restricted attendance at this Conference,which is likely to be held in Denmark in June of this year, to those directly concerned with the provision of adult education and to have left to a laterconference the question of the representation of the &quot; consumers &quot; of adulteducation, such as industrial and agricultural workers. Throughout the debates there was also voiced what we considered to be a too hasty desireior a new comprehensive international organisation in the field of adulteducation, and we succeeded in urging Member States, as an indispensablefoundation for international collaboration, to foster and develop nationalassociations of workers in adult education.28. Other Resolutions. Various measures were passed under this chapterwhich are important but which need no further explanation. The Arts and science in General Education are covered in special resolutions. attention was also paid to language teaching, vocational guidance and technical education and educational opportunities for women.CHAPTER HI. NATURAL SCIENCES29. Field Science Co-operation Offices and International Norn-Govern-mental Organisations. The United Kingdom Delegation recognised in thenatural sciences programme one of the most successful and effective sectionsof the organisation^ work. This programme continues to be based upontwo fundamental activities, support for the well established internationalnon-governmental scientific organisations, such as those federated in the Inter-national Council of Scientific Unions, by a judicious policy of grants-in-aid
which in 1949 will total $200,000, and the maintenance of Field Science Co-operation Offices for the exchange and supply of scientific information,material and personnel.30. The Conservation of Natural Resources. Extensive discussions tookplace on the problem of the conservation of natural resources and theprotection of nature, during which decisions were taken to strengthen thedevelopment of the newly formed International Union for the Protectionof Nature and to call a meeting of it in conjunction with the United nations conference on the Conservation and Utilisation of Natural Resources. The;Conference recognised the urgency of the world food situation and the need to raise nutritional standards by the conservation of natural resources. Itaccordingly placed at the disposal of the United Nations and the specialised agencies its services in the basic sciences, education and mass communica-tions to make known and to meet this problem. Under the Chapter on social Sciences it further agreed that &quot;Food and People&quot; should be the major theme for discussions in 1949 in its work on the social and inter-national implications of science.  (See paragraph 41 following.)31.  International Institutes of the Hylean Amazon and of the Arid Zone. Though not specifically related to the problem of the world&apos;s food, two other resolutions take on added importance because of the potential contri-bution they can make towards its solution. We refer to the strengthening ofthe International Institute of the Hylean Amazon and the development ofits work and to the proposal to consider the establishment of an Inter-national Institue of the Arid Zone. Both are imaginative and yet practicalland valuable undertakings and the United Kingdom was keen in their support.32. Scientific Documentation. Considerable agreement was found on theneed to improve and expand the basic services of scientific documentation.This involves an attempt to rationalise scientific terminology, with thepossibility of preparing multilingual dictionaries in certain specialised fields of science. But more important, because perhaps more urgent, is the need to develop more rapidly an international system of indexing, abstracting andreviewing scientific literature. An internation conference will be held inJune of this year on the subject of scientific abstracting.33. . World Centre of Scientific Liaison.-The title of this group of reso-resolutions reflects the role which the Secretariat in Paris has to play in relationto the scientific world at large. In addition to acting as the headquartersfor the work done by the Field Science Co-operation Offices, information services are being maintained for scientific apparatus, scientific films, andfor a world register of scientific institutions and scientists. The UnitedKingdom Delegation was impressed not only with the tremendous advancesand achievements of science but also with the complete lack or retardationin larger areas of the world of scientific means and methods. The disparityin this respect between the North American continent, for example, and africa or Asia seemed to us to demand the utmost help which this organisation could give towards closing the gap, if not in materials, at least in scientific knowledge. We therefore supported those activities which aregenerally labelled under the term World Centre of Scientific Liaison. for similar reasons&apos; also we approved of a resolution dealing with thepopularisation of science.34. Other Resolutions. We merely wish here to refer to two otherresolutions which were of considerable interest to certain other delegations,,the first to the United States and French Delegations and the second to
the Peruvian Delegation. They are those dealing with a possible Interna-tional Computation Centre and with the study of the problems of highaltitude biology.CHAPTER IV. SOCIAL SCIENCES35. Two items in this Chapter were the subject of special debate in theSub-Commission on Social Sciences and we deal with these first..36. Tensions affecting International Understanding. At the SecondGeneral Conference in 1947, the United States Delegation gave the strongestsupport to this enquiry which was designed as a piece of fundamentalresearch in sociology and psychology into the origin and nature of humanconflicts including the resources available for dealing with them. The UnitedKingdom Delegation, at the instance of its National Co-operating Sody whichhad considered the project before the Mexico City Conference, suggestedcertain conditions for the proposed study which were accepted and whichcontinue to figure in the present plan of work for the &quot; Tensions &quot; project.To the enquiry approved last year the United States Delegation have nowadded a resolution calling for a meeting of experts to study and report uponthe techniques used by Fascists and Nazis to gain power.37. The United Kingdom Delegation did, however, make the discussionan occasion for again calling attention, as it had done at Mexico City, toUNESCO projects in the Philosophy and Humanistic Section, which seemed to have important bearings upon the Tensions project and to be likelyto cause some confusion with it. The comparative study of cultures wasone such example and to remedy this danger a resolution calling for a clear distinction between the two and close co-operation in their execution waspassed.38. The United Kingdom Delegation at Beirut was able to report thatthe United Kingdom National Co-operating Body for the Social Sciences had made progress with certain aspects of this work during the past twelve months and consequently it approved the retention of the project in the 1949programme.39. Internationa! Organisations in the Social Sciences. The successattending unescos aid to the International Council of Scientific Unionsresulting in the creation of the International Council for Philosophy and theHumanities in the autumn of 1948 naturally suggested the establishment ofa similar International Council for the Social Sciences. The Director-general was accordingly asked to promote and aid such a movement.40. Study of International Collaboration. This Chapter also includesresolutions seeking to enlist the co-operation of social scientists in studyingproblems arising from recent developments in international collaboration,particularly those problems which arise, and which for a long time are likelyto continue to rise, from the operation of the United Nations and itsSpecialised Agencies.41. Social and International Implications of Science. We have already referred in paragraph 30 to this item. It is one which falls within theinterest of both the Social Science and Natural Science programmes andopinions may differ on the question whether the problems which modernscience raises in society are problems which scientists themselves can solveor whether, because of their great social and international implications, theyare more appropriately the concern of sociologists. Convinced of theimportance of this problem and the urgent need to find a solution to it,
the United Kingdom Delegation supported work on this subject. In 1949the question should be illuminated by the plans made by UNESCOwith the knowledge of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, to promotewide discussion of the subject of &quot; Food and People.&quot;CHAPTER v.-PHILOSOPHY AND HUMANISTIC STUDIES42. Because of the selective nature of the Agenda, this Chapter did not receive as full discussion as other Programme Chapters. The Conference,however, approved.the continuance of support for the newly establishedInternational Council of Associations in the ficldo of philooophy andhumanistic otudioo-. fkln*-?IL^J-  c^x u^^-^^- ^*-L*Ci,,43. Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind.-The possibility of preparing books which would provide, for general and specialist readers, ahunderstanding of the scientific and cultural aspects of the history of man-kind, of the interdependence of peoples and cultures and their contributionto the common heritage was discussed at a joint session of the Cultural and natural Science Sub-Commissions. A resolution which the United kingdom delegation was able to support, although initially it was doubtful of its valueor practicability except from the long term view, was adopted. The work islikely to be entrusted to a small foundation to which scholars and researchworkers can give their services.44. Declaration of Human Rights. While the Conference was in session,the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Declaration of human Rights. The Conference unanimously accepted the terms of this declaration as .of great importance and it voted enthusiastically and byacclamation to disseminate its text and to make it as widely known aspossible. It was appropriate therefore that one item under this Chaptershould authorise the publication of a volume of essays on the philosophicalprinciples of human rights.45. Other Resolutions. Other work which will go forward under this chapter and for which resolutions were adopted, included an enquiry intothe fundamental concepts of political and sociological speculation and theirrelevance to current ideological conflicts; an&amp; endeavour to enlist the activeaid of philosophers at round table discussions; the promotion of thepublication of an international philosophical journal and the comparativestudies of cultures to which reference has already been made.CHAPTER VI.-CULTURAL  ACTIVITIES46. Arts. The policy of assisting international non-governmental organisations is maintained in the work authorised under this Chapter. Agrant-in-aid will be paid to the successfully established International TheatreInstitute arid efforts will be made to establish and develop a form ofinternational organisation in the field of music.47. In order to make more widely known and more popularly available the works of art of Member States, a series of resolutions was passed dealingwith reproductions in the visual arts and music, and reproductions of uniqueworks of art, scientific works and documents. We had evidence that the.work done so far was encouraging with the appearance of a first portfolioon &quot; Masaccio,&quot; which appeared to us to be an admirable production.48. Two resolutions in this section owe their adoption very largely to thesupport given to them by two individual delegations. A resolution on theFreedom&quot; of the Artist was of particular concern to the United States
Delegation while the United Kingdom Delegation put forward the proposal which was adopted that a series of annual awards for the best achievementduring the year in music, art, drama, education and the humanities be awarded by UNESCO. Such awards would be similar in nature to theNobel prizes in Sweden or the Pulitzer Prize in the United States.49. Letters. Apart from authority to continue an International Pool ofLiterature, the main activities of this section will be concerned with transla-tions. Work on the Translations of Great Books will be continued on theplan adopted jointly by UNESCO and the Economic and Social Councilof the United Nations. In this connection the Director-General was alsoauthorised to assist the resumption of the Index Translationum.50. Museums. We wish to refer here only to the modest but effective workin the field of museums and to the continued production in 1949 of thepublication  &apos; Museum.&quot;51. Libraries and Books. In this section also we have little comment tomake. The Programme Commission did not study the detailed proposalswhich it contained and most delegations including that of the United Kingdomfelt able to adopt the recommendations for continuance of the work which inthe past has been effective and efficiently controlled. Resolutions will be found on public libraries, on bibliographical work and select national bibliographies,on book exchanges and on the reproduction and exchange of periodicalpublications.52. At the instance of the United Kingdom Delegation a grant-in-aid was authorised to the ex-German libraries in Italy. It has been agreed that thecost of maintaining these libraries shall in future be met from the sale ofGerman assets in Italy, but until these libraries are placed upon a properfooting to enable them to resume the valuable service they previously rendered to international scholarship, we believe that a grant of funds was justified toprevent any reduction in the services now provided by them.CHAPTER VII. COMMUNICATION53. The emphasis which in previous Conferences many delegations, notablythose of the United Kingdom and of the United States have consistently placed upon the problem of mass communication is reflected in the prominent place it still occupies in unescos programme. As well as dealing with the fields of radio, film and press, an important first section is devoted to the Exchangeof Persons. - &quot;54. Exchange of Persons. The United kingdom Delegation regarded theinternational movement of persons, whether by exchange or through fellow-ships, as an activity of the highest priority. For this reason it supported therecommendations to continue the collection and distribution of information about the available, opportunities for fellowships and scholarships in all Mem-ber States. We consider unescos first handbook, now published-and called&quot; Study Abroad,&quot; an invaluable help to universities, scholars and studentsin every country of the world. The stimulation of further fellowships andtheir administration by UNESCO was authorised and a small conference onthe administration of these fellowships will be called in 1949. We were particularly anxious to see this conference held as we felt a growing need toensure broadly comparable treatment of fellowships through the very wideprogrammes now being operated by the United Nations and most of the specialised Agencies.
55. Attention should be drawn to the fact that the fellowship programme is specially concerned with mature persons and that, as part of the gradualtransition from reconstruction already referred to, increasing help must begiven to trust and underdeveloped areas.56. Technical Needs of Radio, Film and Press. There is a group ofimportant activities arising partly from unescos reconstruction policy;these are the efforts required to meet the basic technical needs of war-devastated or otherwise underequipped countries in such matters as news-print, radio receiving sets, films, raw materials, equipment and professionaltraining. .   -........ - -  -    - -    ......57. Two surveys of these technical needs have already been carried out and the results published. They reveal needs on such a scale that furthersurveys appeared to the Unied Kingdom Delegation to be superfluous. Never-theless, in spite of our argument that all efforts should now be concentrated on meeting the needs already known, the Conference recommended theextension of these surveys, although on a reduced scale.58. Removal of Obstacles to the Free Flow of Information.-From theinformation which the Technical Needs Reports provide, it is clear that, even where the physical equipment is available, man-made obstacles are preventing the intercommunication of peoples and that free flow of information and ideaswhich we believe to be the fundamental basis of peace and security. Suchobstacles are high prices of newsprint or radio sets, high tariffs, restrictivecurrency controls and transport difficulties. These must be enumerated andstudied in an effort to find remedies for them. The United Kingdom delegation was under no illusion that rapid action is likely to be possible along manyof these lines.59. International Agreement concerning Audio-Visual Aids. One practicalstep was taken at the urgent instance of the United States Delegation whenthe Conference agreed to approve the text of a draft international agreement to facilitate international circulation of visual and auditory material of aneducational, scietific and cultural character. The United Kingdom Delegationtried to improve the terms of this Agreement but owing to its inability to consult all interested parties in the United Kingdom, and in the belief that further revision was necessary, it abstained from voting for its adoption atthe Conference. The text of the Agreement was, however, adopted and aresolution dealing with its coming into force was passed.60. Book Coupon Scheme. One other practical device has also emerged from the stage of discussion and planning to undergo practical trial. Duringthe General Conference a brief ceremony greeted the inauguration ofUNESCCs book coupons. These are vouchers which can be bought in soft-currency and exchanged against books sold in hard currency countries,UNESCO honouring the transaction by agreeing to find the hard currencynecessary to redeem the coupon. Thus a Frenchman needing a serious non-fiction English or American book can buy a UNESCO coupon for francswhich he can send to an English or American bookseller who will supplyit and look to UNESCO for payment. The scheme is naturally limited byUNESCCs available sterling or dollar holdings and the experiment cannotoffer unlimited numbers of such coupons. But something will be done through this means to break down a part of one serious barrier to the exchange ofideas through the printed page. The United Kingdom has agreed to participate in this experiment. &apos;
61. Travel Compensation Scheme. A scheme was considered to augmentthe flow of hard currency to soft currency areas by devising a travel com-pensation scheme, but this proposal is still at the planning stage. The UnitedKingdom Delegation remained unconvinced of the practicability of the schemebut as other Member States likely to be far more heavily involved in itsactual operation have welcomed it, the United Kingdom saw no objection to enquiries being pursued.62. International Institute of the Press. It was the United Kingdomsconviction that the proposal to establish an International Institute of the Presswas premature. Whatever good might result from such an Institute in theway of providing an international forum for the discussion by journalists oftheir professional problems and of the problem of the freedom of information,it must be those journalists themselves or the organised bodies of journalisticopinion which must initiate such an Institute. We secured the adoption ofa resolution to this effect.63. Projects Division, This activity was included in the programme on theinitiative of the United Kingdom Delegation to the Second General Conferencein Mexico City. The Projects Division was conceived essentially as a small but highly qualified section of the Secretariat alert to pick out of the day-to-day news of the workTs press and information services one or two topicalthemes which could be presented to the world in a way to bring out and toheighten their bearing upon international co-operation and world peace.Such UNESCO themes, when selected, would rapidly be brought to thenotice of the world&apos;s press and radio services, sometimes perhaps to its newsreel and film industries in the hope of seeing them developed and distributedby those services.64. The essential character of the services which the Projects division would offer would be to stimulate the treatment by others of themes oftopical interest. The small staff at unescos headquarters would not itselfseek to develop those themes and the utmost it would offer would be indica-tions of the source of further information.IxL. fvvW--  5 rj,^ Tjnite(i Kingdom Delegation went to Beirut apprehensive that both4 r**** the emphasis upon topicality and the emphasis upon stimulation rather than  *MT***v* actual production were absent from the Projects Division^ activities. In&quot;vneno ,,the discussions which ensued the Secretariat were able to provide a reassuranceuoM (UvUj on both points. Concrete schemes are in preparation, notablyXa scrics-of^ Wo^ broadcaGtB and the publication of a world oalondar calling attention to&apos;jjjuLXU    significant anniversarieG in tho annuals of education, science and culture.66. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom Delegation sought to clarify the division^ work and to give it positive direction, concentrating upon the requirement that leading writers, publicists and others should be commissionedto prepare articles and broadcasts on subjects in unescos field, whichcan be offered through direct contacts, to the directors of leading publications,radio networks and film companies.67. Radio, Films and Press. As the result of the rearrangement of work under this Chapter, the activities falling within the field of radio, film and press have been reduced and concentrated. The resolutions in question areself-explanatory and we see in them the basis for much effective work in1949. Under Radio, arrangements are made for wide consultation with national broadcasting organisations and for a practical study of school broad-
casting. Under Films, a film production committee will be set up for consultations; catalogues of films suitable for discussion groups will be,prepared, and if possible, two documentary films with relateddiscussionmaterial, will be produced. Under Press, questions of newsprint, obstacles to the freedom of information and technical needs, as well as the professionalaspect of the Press, will be the subjects of direct discussion between the.Organisation and an expert Press and Publications Committee,68. Public Relations.-We wish to point out here that communication isconsidered as a subject apart from public relations, for which separate resolu-tions were adopted by the Committee of Fifteen.  (See paragraphs i3*-ny)3. THE BUDGET OF UNESCO69. The preparation of the annual budget is the responsibility of theDirector-General. . His original estimates for 1948 totalled $8,473,530, anincrease of nearly $791,000 over the approved figure for 1948. This increase was not in respect of any demands for additional staff or of any increasein programme activities. It was due almost entirely to the increased costof living in Paris. This fact and its adverse effect upon the possibility ofestablishing a stable budgetary policy was a matter for serious considerationby the United Kingdom Delegation. The fact that a devaluation of the franc shortly before the opening of the Conference had enabled a reductionof some $200,000 to be made in the estimates did not lessen the danger ofan increasingly inflated budget.70. In the early stages of the Session, the Conference took a decision inprinciple, that the final budget should not exceed $8,000,000 and that, ifpossible, it should be even lower than that figure. After detailed considerationof the programme, the administration and the external relations policy ofthe Organisation by the appropriate Commissions, the Budget was submittedto the Budget Sub-Commission of ten members for examination and theybegan their work under the Conference instruction to reduce the total toa figure lower than $8,000,000.71. The United Kingdom Delegation, while it was entirely satisfied withthe firm and workmanlike presentation of the Budget document, believedthat many economies could be made. It therefore instructed the United,Kingdom representative, Dr. W. P. Alexander, to press for reductions wherever possible and particularly in the sections where centralised administrative costs were known to be abnormally high. The Budget Sub-Commission performedits task under very heavy pressure of work. Their recommendations were adopted with only minor amendments. A Budget for 1949 of $78Q?000 was 7,7^,***therefore finally approved, representing a reduction over the estimates ofsome $690,000 and leaving the Budget for 1949 only slightly in excess ofthat for 1948.72. The relation of the Budget to the Programme and the distinction inthe appropriations between administrative costs and programme costs, remain,and are likely to remain, matters of debate. It is possible to interpret theappropriations, incorrectly in our view, to show that nearly fifty per cent,of the total Budget is devoted to personnel and administration. We must point out that funds which are spent on personnel cannot be regarded whollyas administrative costs since the majority of the staff is engaged on programmeduties.   We believe furthermore that the division of the appropriation into
the four parts of the appropriation table gives a fair and accurate statementof the allocation of funds for administration and programme purposesrespectively. We abstract the following figures for reference purposes:-$Part   I.-General Policy    ............ 268,740Part II. General Administration......... 2,019,798Part III.

We do not intend to comment in detail upon the Budget. It is sufficient to say that a saving of about $45,000 was made on the estimates for Part I, General Policy, of about $160,000 for Part II, General Adminis-tration&apos;, where we felt it was most deserved, and of a further $175,000 onPart III, Programme Operations. Moreover, as the result of the resolution on the administrative organisation to which we have already made reference,we look forward with confidence to further appreciable reductions next year in Part II of the Budget, At the same time we are not unsatisfied with thefact that the proportion of the Budget used for general administration now stands at only a little over a quarter, which does not compare unfavourably with other Specialised Agencies or with the United Nations itself.
74. It is in connection with the need for greater comparability between the budgetary and accounting policies of the many agencies of the united nations that the Conference adopted a resolution recommending that thenecessary steps be taken to ensure that by 1950 the Budget of UNESCOfollows the standard pattern of the United Nations for appropriations andaccounting purposes, providing that it could still clearly show the cost ofeach programme activity separately. This recommendation brings yetone stage nearer that co-ordination which is indispensable for the united nations, its Specialised Agencies and the international civil service which is coming into being to serve them.4 FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANISATION75. Introduction. Apart from the approval of a programme of work andthe appropriation of funds matched to that programme, the Conference hadto satisfy itself that the financial and administrative organisation was suited to the execution of the programme and the appropriate control of the funds.The decisions which the Conference took on these matters fall therefore into two groups, those which deal with the nature, expenditure and accounting ofthe money voted in the Budget, and those which deal with the recruitment,remuneration and organisation of the staff of the Secretariat.76. The United Kingdom Delegation found the financial organisation satis-factory as a whole, but there were many matters of administrative organisa-tion, particularly of the organisation of the staff, which it examined criticallyand which it believes the Conference to some extent remedied. We havealready said that the system of administration was, in our opinion, too rigid.It was based upon a too severe separation of responsibility between theprogramme staff and the administrative staff. The result was that a compli-cated, and, we believe, unnecessary burden of administrative procedures and checks was placed upon the organisation which absorbed an undueproportion of staff and funds and which subjected the programme staff to the disadvantages of a too rigid supervision and control. Reference has alreadybeen made to the important resolution which the United Kingdom Delega-tion succeeded in having adopted by which we hope that this particularsituation will be largely overcome.77. The following paragraphs comment briefly upon the main decisions which the Conference took, and provide a reasonable statement of thepresent financial and administrative organisation.78. The Auditors&apos; Report.-We were well aware that the Auditors&apos; report upon the accounts of the organisation for 1946 was unsatisfactory but thatlater reports covering the first part of 1947 showed a marked improvement.We therefore examined with particular care the two Reports submitted to theConference, one in respect of the financial year 1947 as a whole and the other for the first six months of 1948.79. The Reports themselves are lengthy documents and, as they will bepublished by UNESCO in the official proceedings of the Conference, we see no reason to include them in extenso in this Report. Nevertheless, wemust make clear that the two Reports in question showed a satisfactorysituation with regard to financial control and expenditure. In their Reportfor 1947, Messrs. Price and Waterhouse, the Auditors, state&quot;We have reviewed the accounting procedures and the system ofinternal control ... we have made such exhaustive tests of the account-ing methods as we considered appropriate. ... In our opinion, based
on such examination, the statements ... summarise fairly the budgetaryand financial operations of UNESCO for the first financial period of UNESCO ending December 31st, 1947.&quot;In their Report up to 30th June, 1948, the Auditors report:&quot; In connection herewith we counted the cash and unbanked collectionson hand as at the close of business on 30th June, 1948, and reconciledthe bank balances at that date. . . . Obligations incurred and relativeexpenditure were tested with approved documents and indirect obliga.tions were ascertained to have been distributed in accordance withdirectives issued by the Bureau of Administrative Management andBudget. ... In general we examined or test-checked accounting records of the&quot; Organisation and other supporting evidence and obtained informa-tion and explanations from officials and employees. ... In our opinion,based upon such examination, the statements . . . summarise fairlythe recorded budgetary and financial operations of UNESCO for the six months ending June 30th, 1948. . . . Moreover . . . money has notbeen obligated or expended for purposes other than those voted by theGeneral Conference except in so far as the Director-General and theExecutive Board have authorised transfers within the Budget, and theexpenditure conforms to the authority which governs it.&quot;80. Apart from certain small recommendations concerning exchange diffi-culties bank charges and a possible alteration in one of the financial regula-tions with which the Conference dealt separately, the Reports in generalshowed a satisfactory state of affairs, and the United Kingdom voted infavour of their adoption.81. Scales of Contribution. In 1948 the outstanding fact about the scales of contribution to the Budget was that the United States paid over 40 per cent,and the United Kingdom over 13 per cent, of the total Budget. The UnitedStates Delegation proposed a resolution, which the United Nations hadalready accepted in principle that in normal times no one Member state should contribute more than one third of the ordinary expenditure of theOrganisation for any one year. The resolution went on, however, to applythis principle to some degree and recommended that, as world conditionspermitted Or as new members were admitted, any contribution greater thanone third of the total Budget should&quot; be reduced to below that figure. Sincethe United States contribution had been originally settled, some fifteen new members had joined the Organisation and their Delegation consequentlypressed for a reduction in its contribution. The United Kingdom Delegationconsidered this was a just claim and voted to reduce the American contri-bution by one third of the difference between 41.88 per cent., their 1948contribution, and 33  per cent. This resulted in a contribution from theUnited States for 1949 of 38.47 per cent. In consequence the contributions of other Member States were raised slightly, notwithstanding the fact that several new countries who had joined the Organisation would be makingnew contributions. The United Kingdom Contribution stands at 13.55 percent, as against 13.38 per cent, in 1948.82. Payment of Contributions. In order to define precisely its attitude to Member States who fall into arrears with the payment of their contribu-tions, a resolution was adopted unanimously recommending that such Statesshall have no vote in the General Conference if the amount of theirarrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contribution for the precedingtwo years. This is a precaution already adopted by the United Nations and several of its Specialised Agencies.
83. Currency of Contributions. Unlike the United Nations and the;majority of Specialised Agencies which require payment to be made in dollarsor other hard currencies, UNESCO permits Member States to pay in the currency of their choice. There was a strong argument from many delega-tions that, in order to avoid exchange losses, all Member States should payin dollars. The United Kingdom was unable to accept this proposal and thenormal practice of paying in the most convenient currency was maintained.Nineteen countries agreed to pay in U.S. dollars, eighteen countries in U.S.dollars, pounds sterling or French francs, and seven countries, including theUnited Kingdom and the Commonwealth countries in pounds sterling or, ifthey chose, in U.S. dollars. The United Kingdom contribution will be paidin pounds sterling convertible only into French francs.84. Administration of the Revolving Fund. The Revolving Fund is a loan which may not exceed $3,000,000 from Member States to the Organisa-tion. $2,000,000 have already been called in and the Conference authorised the collection of the last $1,000,000. Normally payment is made to theRevolving Fund in the same proportion as payment to the Budget. Thisyear it was agreed by exception that the Budget surplus for 1947, instead ofbeing surrendered to the Budget for 1949 should be absorbed into the Revolv-ing Fund for 1949. The Budget surplus for 1947 and other miscellaneousadjustments totalled $836,232, so that Member States need find only thebalance of $163,768. This will mean that the actual monetary payment ofeach Member State, although its percentage contribution may have risen, willin fact be lessjttw^85. The particular purposes for which the Revolving Fund may be usedwere also laid down in a special resolution.86. Amendments to Financial Regulations. We need mention only oneof the two regulations adopted since it was one which the United Kingdomopposed in principle. It arises from a point raised in the Auditors&apos; report and concerns the,use of funds which have not actually been committed for expenditure during the year for which they were authorised. Normally suchfunds are surrendered to the next consecutive Budget. Funds, however, whichwere committed but not actually spent could remain available for liquidationand payment for a period of three years from the first day of the financialyear to which they relate. The resolution which was adopted authorised, in exceptional circumstances, the retention of surplus funds for the same periodof three years even if they have not legally been committed, provided thatthere are good reasons why they should not be surrendered. If such good reasons exist, the funds may be retained, provided that the Executive board is satisfied that they will be committed without undue delay. The UnitedKingdom Delegation opposed this amendment since it felt that all funds should be directly authorised by the General Conference and that none shouldbe allowed to carry over from one year to the next without being revoted bythe General Conference.87. Miscellaneous Income. The Organisation derives some income fromthe sales of its publications and from reimbursement for the loan of its per-sonnel to other organisations for short periods. The United Kingdom Dele-gation supported a resolution to absorb this revenue into a separate fund which could be used to print and sell additional copies of the publicationsproviding such revenue or to hire additional temporary staff for short periods.88. Preparation of Budget Estimates. The United States Delegationsecured the adoption of a motion whereby the Budget, which the Director-General prepares and on which the Executive Board submits a report, should
be considered also by an independent Expert Panel on Finance and Adminis-tration. The United Kingdom Delegation was unable to vote for &quot;this resolution as it believed that the Budget was already subject to adequateexamination and that its submission to any independent body would delayits despatch to Member States who wish to receive the Budget Estimateseven sooner than at present has been possible.89. Salary and Allowance System. The widest discussions took place, and much criticism was heard, on the subject of the salaries and allowances paidto members of the staff. Few other problems deserved more attention and none was more complex. The assumptions underlying the system in force were three-fold: the UNESCO Secretariats salaries and allowances shouldbe comparable in terms of purchasing power with those of the United nations and other Specialised Agencies ; the salary scale should provide equal basepay for staff members in the same grade regardless of nationality ; the allow-ance system should be flexible to allow for periodic fluctuations in the cost ofliving in France.90. The system includes the payment of a base salary for each of the 18grades of staff, fixed allowances in respect of dislocation and installation costs,childrehs and education allowances, and a special cost of living allowance.This latter allowance is one which is adjusted to the official cost of living index issued by the French Government and it provides for an increase or decrease of 10 per cent, of basic salary whenever the official index rises orfalls by 10 per cent.91. The United Kingdom Delegation satisfied itself that the total remunera-tion received under this system was comparable with that of officials in theUnited Nations, that in many cases it was less than that paid to diplomatic missions in the main capital cities of the world and that, as it stood, it wasin some cases insufficient to attract to the uncertainties of international lifecandidates of the necessary quality. Moreover, if these salaries appear highin comparison with national standards, it must be realised, that there is nosecurity of tenure and that the contracts for most appointments are for very short periods only. In principle therefore, the United Kingdom Delegationcould do no less than support the present system, but it also approved of theseveral suggestions which emerged from the discussions and it advocated thatthe Organisation should participate in the forthcoming study by the united nations concerning the salaries and allowances and leave provisions of itsSecretariat. In this way we believe that another step will be taken to ensure a comparable basis of service between the United Nations and the specialised agencies.92. Joint Staff Pensions Scheme. As a further development towards theco-ordinated administration of the various organs of the United Nations theConference considered the proposal that UNESCO should participate in theUnited Nations Joint Staff Pensions Scheme. The Conference reviewed theexisting pensions scheme which it found equitable and it was therefore prepared to recommend that the Joint Scheme which the General Assemblyof the United Nations had already approved and which was broadly com-parable with the system in force, should be adopted in its place.93. Medical Benefits Scheme. In considering the emoluments paid to members of the Secretariat the Conference took account of the indirectassistance received through welfare provision such as the Medical BenefitsScheme. It considered whether such welfare assistance was not an indirectcontribution to the income of the staff and whether allowance should not bemade for such assistance by a reduction in the monetary allowance actually
paid, lt was therefore unprepared to do more than provisionally adopt theScheme, pending the general survey already mentioned of salaries and allow-ances which the United Nations is to make. The Medical Benefits scheme will therefore continue to operate temporarily, subject to further review,particularly of a detailed actuarial analysis of its operation to be presentedat the next General Conference.94. Amendments to Staff Regulations.-We have, no comments to offerexcept to say that these regulations are binding upon the Director-general in respect of the appointment, status, responsibilities and privileges of staffmembers. Certain changes in the existing regulations were necessary owingto changing circumstances and these were approved with general agreement.95. Distribution by Nationality of Steffi.-The question of the number of vacancies on the staff which each Member State is filling has always been a subject of debate and complaint by the smaller nations. Of the 293 staffmembers between the upper grades 5 to 18, 48 were filled by the UnitedStates, 47 by the United Kingdom, 37 by France and 10 each by canada and Belgium. Of the remaining 40 States none has more than 10, themajority have many less, such as India 8, Australia 5 and New Zealand 3,and some have none at all including several of the Latin American States.This situation is the more unsatisfactory in an Organisation which proclaimsthat every nation has a contribution to make to education, science andculture. The United Kingdom, in voicing its regret at the present distribu-tion, also clearly stated that the first criterion, in the selection of staff mustnevertheless remain that of the suitability of the candidate for the postirrespective of his nationality. The burden of the solution lies upon the member States themselves who should provide candidates of the necessaryquality and it was a resolution in this sense that the Conference adopted.96. Organisation of the Secretariat. Several references have been madeto the important resolution concerning the organisation of the secretariat and the balance between administration and programme personnel. this resolution requested the Director-General to consider critically &quot; the need forfacilitating and accelerating operational action by programme departments and for concentrating a larger measure of administrative responsibility uponthe heads of programme departments.&quot; It also pointed out the need to effecteconomies both financially and in personnel in the Administration. Wetherefore look to the Fourth Session of the General Conference to ensurethat substantial improvements have been made.5. OFFICIAL AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS97. Introduction. The relationship of the headquarters secretariat withthe Governments and National Commissions of Member States, the inter-relationship between those Governments and Commissions, their functionwith regard to non-member States and their co-operation with the united nations, its Specialised Agencies and the great number of international non-governmental organisations concerned with education, science and culture,-these constitute those aspects of the Organisation^ work which are referredto as its official and external relations. This somewhat formal title coverswhat is, in many respects, the most important element in unescos exist-ence, the maintenance of the widest network of intercommunication and inter--relationship between individuals, institutions, communities, nations and governments.98. These matters were considered at length by a special commission on official and External Relations, of which Mr. D. R. Hardman, Parliamentary
Secretary of the Ministry of Education was Chairman. The main features of the resolutions which were adopted upon their report to the general conference are summarised in the following paragraphs.99. The Representation of UNESCO in the main Cultural Areas of theWorld. The proposal to strengthen unescos contacts with and therebyto. intensify its impact upon the main cultural areas of the world was approved at the Second Session in Mexico City in 1947. Such action can,however, involve a considerable cost. It is also likely to be more effective if it is carried out in concert with the United Nations and other specialised agencies with whom UNESCO might, for example, share premises. Forthese reasons UNESCO has delayed the establishment of regional centresdespite an offer strongly pressed by the Government of Cuba at both theSecond and Third Sessions to contribute towards the cost of establishing a regional Centre to be located in Cuba.100. The United Kingdom Delegation, while opposing the establishmentof a regional centre in the Western hemisphere until a policy had beenco-ordinated with the United Nations, nevertheless supported a more modestproposal, which was carried, to create at unescos headquarters in Paris,a cultural liaison service with the Middle East.101. Relations with Member States. The United Kingdom delegation was represented on the Drafting Committee which drew up the resolutionsrelating to the Annual Reports to be furnished by Member States in accord-ance with Article VIII of unescos Constitution. The Commission was concerned to prevent rules being adopted requiring Member States to producelengthy reports in great detail covering the whole of their year&apos;s work in education, science and culture, on the grounds that few Member states would be in a position to provide such material annually and that therewould be few readers for such a voluminous series of reports if they were actually completed.102. It was upon a motion of the United Kingdom Delegation that theCommission agreed to defer consideration of the draft regulations proposed for the preparation and application of International Conventions since the text proposed for the Commission^ consideration had not been received byail Member States before their Delegations left home for the journey toBeirut. The matter is of obvious importance and Member States will nodoubt wish to study the draft regulations in the light of similar rules worked out by the International Labour Office &quot;and other international organisationsin the past.103. Relations with Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories. TheConference accepted amendments proposed by the United Kingdom Delega-tion whose broad effect was to emphasise the role which the governmentsof the non-self-governing territories should themselves play in the implement a-tion of unescos programme. The short description &quot; non-self-governing &quot;. used to describe territories such as many of the British Colonial territories&quot;for whose foreign relationships H.M. Government in the United kingdom is responsible, obscures the great extent to which they are already self-governing, particularly in domestic matters of educational policy.104. It is not unknown elsewhere for critics to seek to embarrass HisMajesty&apos;s Government by charges of imperialistic oppression in its colonial territories which can derive plausibility solely from deliberate suppression ofand disregard for the true facts about the actual state of self-governmentin those territories at the present time, the conditions of its evolution and-
its ultimate destiny. Despite the recent examples two such territories nowafford, namely Burma and Ceylon, the true tenor of British Colonial adminis-tration is rarely appreciated and frequently misunderstood.105. The United Kingdom Delegation fortunately had no reason to corn-plain of the attitude of the Third General Conference of UNESCO in Beirutto this question. The Conference was assured by the United Kingdom Dele-gation that steps would be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to discoverhow best to associate British Colonial territories with the policy and purposeof UNESCO.106. UNESCO&apos;s Relations with Germany and Japan. Few questions be-fore UNESCO have in the past been found to raise greater difficulties than theOrganisation^ relations with Germany. Memories of Germany&apos;s aggressionare understandably deep and exceedingly bitter. There has, therefore, beena natural sympathy with Member States, particularly those of Eastern Europe,who would seek sharply to restrict the role which UNESCO&apos; might play inGermany. On the other hand there are Member States who have also suffered very severely from the armed might and still more from the civil administration of Nazi Germany, who yet turn their thoughts from the past and view the problem rather from the point of view of the possible futureimpact of unescos work upon the German people.107. From these contrasting views a policy of action has now emerged.It represents the conclusions of discussions begun at the Second Sessionof the General Conference in 1947 and continued in the Executive Board dur-ing 1948. The. relatively small budgetary allocation approved for these activities ($75,000) indicates the restricted scope they are likely to haveduring 1949. Nevertheless a beginning has been made. Within the frame-work outlined by the resolutions UNESCO may circulate books and otherpublications, exchange information and facilitate links through visits andthe exchange of persons thereby to restore to some extent that fruitful reia-tionship between the leaders of education, science and culture of Germanyand the rest of the world whose beneficient results and great promise of future benefits was tragically shattered by the triumph in Germany of all those forces against which the whole spirit and purpose, not merely of UNESCO,but of the League of Nations and of the United Nations, was and is nowbeing mobilised.108. The Conference emphasised in its resolutions that unescos workin this field should be undertaken solely through the appropriate alliedauthorities in Germany. The Conference authorised the Director general to create advisory committees of experts to guide the Organisation in theadministration of the approved programme in Germany and Japan respec-tively. The absence of the Soviet Union which is not a member of UNESCOand its. refusal to accept the Organisation^ proposals will mean that thepresent programme will not operate outside the Western Zones of Germany.109. A broadly similar proposal without, however, any such territorialrestriction was also approved for Japan.110. Admission of Diminutive States to Membership of UNESCO.-Theapplication of the Principality of Monaco to join the Organisation was con-sidered by the Second Session of the General Conference and referred to theEconomic and Social Council for advice as a general problem of policyaffecting all the United Nations Organisations.111. The matter was again considered by the Official and External Rela-tions Commission in the light of the reply from the Economic and social council. The United States Delegation proposed a new category of Associate
Membership for both diminutive states and non-self-governing territories butthe observer from Monaco, having declared that Associate membership would be unacceptable to his Government and the difficulties of accommo-dating Associate Membership within the Constitution and procedure of UNESCO having been revealed during the discussions, together with theUnited Kingdom&apos;s objections to comparing territories like Nigeria withdiminutive states ; the United States Delegation withdrew its motion.112. The Commission resolved that each application should be treated onits merits, a view which was accepted by the Conference, and it voted to admit Monaco as a full member of the Organisation.113. The work of National Commissions and Co-operating Bodies. Sped-ally characteristic of the activity of UNESCO is the requirement in its Consti-tution that all Member States should form National Commissions or NationalCo-operating Bodies composed of or representing the leading influences intheir educational, scientific and cultural life. These Commissions and bodies are devised to ensure that the purposes and aims of UNESCO are under-stood and supported by great numbers of people outside the merely officialcircles in each country.114. The United States Government is outstanding for the leadership andenergy it has shown in this aspect of UNESCO&apos;s work. The United Kingdomalso, having been one of the first Member States to create a series of NationalCo-operating Bodies and a United Kingdom Committee, which collectivelyrepresent its National Commission, has always emphasised the necessityfor strengthening this new and important form of international machinerydedicated to international purposes. Not all Member States have establishedNational Commissions but the number who have done so is now 32 andnew commissions are being set up in several others. To assist and strengthenthis movement a special two-day meeting on the work of National Commis-sions was held in Beirut before the Third Session opened and the reseiu-tions approved by the Conference, are based upon the findings andrecommendations of those meetings.115. The United Kingdom Delegation was glad to have had these oppor-tunities of contributing from its own experience towards the shaping of a movement by which, it is convinced, UNESCO&apos;s cause can powerfully be sustained. The Leader of the United Kingdom Delegation and its othermembers missed no opportunity both of insisting upon the duty of every member State to devise every possible aid for unescos programme by itsown methods, and of expressing their conviction that it would be invitingdefeat and failure to suppose that Member States and the rest of the worldmight be content to regard all executive action as the responsibility of the secretariat at Unesco House in Paris. Not until vigorous National Corn-missions flourish in every Member State will it be possible to regard thispolicy of the United Kingdom Delegation as the platitude it really oughtto be.116. Privileges and Immunities of the Specialised Agencies. The UnitedKingdom and other Delegations have always pressed for a uniform policy on this question which has consequently been referred to the general assembly of the United Nations by whom a draft model Convention forthe award of privileges and immunities to all Specialised Agencies has beenprepared. The Official and External Relations Commission decided to acceptthe standard clauses proposed by the United Nations subject only to an addi-tion of the award of privileges to the Deputy Director-General similar to thoseenjoyed by the Director-General.: This addition had been proposed by theExecutive Board and it was supported, in the face of some opposition, by
the United Kingdom Delegation, on the ground that the Deputy Director-General was often required to act as Director-General in the latter&apos;s absenceand that it was therefore not unreasonable to grant him the same privilegedstatus. The Conference approved the standard clauses of the Convention,with this amendment. The Secretary-General of the United Nations will beso informed and all Member States will be invited to accede to it, and asfar as possible to honour its clauses pending formal accession.117. The Conference also approved arrangements to enable members of UNESCO&apos;s Secretariat to use the laissez-passer of the United Nations. Withthis work may be associated a special resolution of the Commission passedsubsequently asking Member States to facilitate journeys to UNESCO&apos;s head-quarters of the wives and families of members newly appointed to the secretariat.118. Budgetary and General Co-ordination of the work of UNESCO withthat of the United Nations and its Specialised Agencies.-The rate at whichthe United Nations activities and international co-operation generally havebeen increasing in recent years inevitably gives rise to the need of avoidingoverlapping, of adopting broadly similar methods respecting budgetary andadministrative questions and above all of concerting the whole force of theUnited Nations for the achievement of general approved common purpose.119. Many of the questions which fall to be decided under this head arenew and much patient work has to be devoted to their solution. Both themethods and machinery need constant review and adjustment in the inter-national context in which the various United Nations organisations operate and it was in order to emphasise the importance of concentrating upon this task that the General Conference passed the resolution dealing with budgetaryand general co-ordination.120. Relations with Inter-Governmental International Organisations. There is only one such organisation with which UNESCO has formalrelationships ; the International Bureau of Education. It was perhaps naturalto assume that the Bureau would immediately be absorbed into the newlyformed UNESCO after 1946, but in all succeeding General ConferencesMember States have agreed that as long as the Bureau can maintain itspresent useful work and continue to finance itself by the special advantagesit now enjoys, then no useful purpose would be served by its amalgamationwith UNESCO. The General Conference saw no reason to depart fromthis policy and the renewal of unescos present agreement by which it makes an annual grant-in-aid to the Bureau was therefore approved.121. We should point out that although only one formal agreement hasbeen concluded with an intergovernmental organisation, close and cordialliaison is maintained informally with several others, such as the InternationalHydrographic Bureau and the International Institute of the Hylean Amazon.Moreover, special agreements have been concluded with several of the specialised Agencies of the United Nations.122. Relations with International Non-Governmental Organisations. Aspart Of its policy of encouraging the widest possible contribution to the aims and purposes set out in its Constitution, UNESCO has consistentlylooked towards existing &quot;non-governmental international associations andlearned organisations for support. It has also regarded aid given to such bodies as one of the most effective methods of expressing those aims in practical ways. Consequently a considerable part of its budget has beendevoted to grants-in-aid and other payments to well established international organisations in the fields of education, science and cultura.
123. When such organisations do not exist, UNESCO has taken the leadin seeking to establish them. In 1948, for example, the International TheatreInstitute and the International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studiescame into being. For, already in its short two years of life, UNESCO hasbeen able to demonstrate the efficacy of such support for existing international bodies by observing the beneficient results of its grants, notably to and through the International Council of Scientific Unions. Reflection upon this experience, brief as it necessarily is, has already resulted in the formation of a code of practice governing the financial relationships between UNESCO andmany other organisations already promoting or wishing to work together for international understanding while pursuing their own special objectives for the enlargement of mankind&apos;s achievements whether in professional life,in the sciences or in the arts. This code is set out in full as a Directive inthe Report of the Official and External Relations Commission and the UnitedKingdom Delegation earnestly commends it to the study of all those who,being members of international non-governmental organisations in the fields of education, science or culture or who are seeking to establish such organisa-tions, contemplate closer association with UNESCO.124. The United Kingdom Delegation has always sought to ensure thatin its recognitions of such non-governmental organisations UNESCO shouldexclude national organisations. This principle receives recognition in the directive established by the Third Session of the General Conference. Theneed for the greatest care in the distribution of aid from unescos budgetwas especially emphasised by the United States Delegation who, however,tempered the vigour of the first expression of their views before theCommission after further examination of the circumstances in which grantshad actually been made. Their proposal for a triennial review by theExecutive Board of all grants was ultimately agreed.125. unescos association with international non-governmental organisa-tions, apart from merely informal relationships, and apart from the formationof advisory committees grouping several organisations associated withUNESCO, takes the form either of consultative arrangements or of formalagreements.126. The privileges accorded to organisations having consultativearrangements and their reciprocal obligations to UNESCO are described indetail in this Directive under the headings &quot; Princpiles governing Relation-ships,&quot; &quot; Organisations eligible to enter into Relationships &quot; and &quot; procedure for selecting the organisations with which UNESCO will enter intoRelationship.&quot;127. Under the last named heading those Formal Agreements are considered which are prescribed for all international non-governmental organisations to which UNESCO gives financial aid or the equivalent offinancial aid in the shape of free office space and secretarial facilities. the distinction between grants-in-aid and the now more generally favouredpayments on a contractual basis for specific pieces of work which UNESCOdesires to see undertaken, is established in the section of the Directive on&quot; Payments to International Non-Governmental and Semi-governmental organisations.&quot; The purposes for which grants-in-aid may be made byUNESCO and the purposes for which contracts may be concluded are setout in subsequent sections.128. Together with the work of National Commissions and NationalCo-operating Bodies, this activity of UNESCO in aiding and stimulatinginternational non-governmental organisations offers the most hopeful line
of action in orientating the minds of intellectual workers everywhere to the:great cause of international harmony and collaboration for which UNESCOwas created.129. Study of an International Union of Organisations working for Peace&apos;or Promoting International Understanding. As a pendant to its work onrelationships with international non-govermental organisations, the official and External Relations Commission had before it a resolution from the *Delegation for Austria looking towards some unification of effort on thepart of many organisations at present seeking to promote peace. The originalresolution emerged in an amended and expanded form from the Commission^discussions. The United Kingdom Delegation suggested some modifications,particularly the desirability of associating the project with the work of theSocial Sciences programme of UNESCO, and the resolution was adopted bythe General Conference in that form.130. Institute of Cultural Co-operation for South and East Asian countries. Proposed by the Delegation of India, this project was strongly criticised by the Delegation of France on the grounds that it favoured a spirit of regional nationalism which UNESCO must at all costs oppose. The UnitedKingdom Delegation, however, supported the proposal subject to amendmentslinking the work of the suggested Institute with the National Commissionsin the areas concerned and with the United Nations and other specialised agencies. The Indian Delegation accepted these amendments and it seemedtherefore desirable to welcome the creation of a new regional force, which,as the Delegation of India pointed out, could and would be established bythem in any event for the purposes for which UNESCO itself was created.131. Liaison with Labour Organisations. A resolution drawing attentionto the desirability of enlisting the support of labour organisations forUNESCCs objectives was proposed by the United States Delegation and afterdebate was finally accepted by the Conference in a way not thought to definetoo strictly the exact form the proposed relationship should take.6. THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN132. An experiment in co-ordination between the three main commission of the Conference was made at Beirut by the establishment of a joint com-mittee of five members from each of them known as the Committee of fifteen. It was set up to deal with three main tasks in the field ofUNESCCs public relations and information services.133. The United Kingdom Delegation welcomed this opportunity the Com-mittee afforded of seeking a revision of the project for the World Centre forthe Exchange of Information, which, in its opinion, threatened to duplicatethe functions of the Programme Departments. The resolution passed by theCommittee on this subject was strongly reinforced by the action of theBudget Sub-Commission, at the instance of the United Kingdom Delegate,whose resolution removed any financial authorisation for the posts consideredby both Committees to be surplus in the department misleadingly called a world Centre.134. The United Kingdom Delegation also took the lead in advocatingbefore the Committee a critical examination of the entire publications pro^gramme of UNESCO, calling for a survey of the various classes of publica-tions, the methods used for their production, distribution and sale,bibliographical methods and publicity methods as well as for a complete
revision of the present accounting methods, which, it appeared, allowed theOrganisation no possibility of paying for the printing of additional copies ofits publications required for sale.135. In other ways the Committee recommended considerable improve-ments in unescos publishing and public relations work; by widening the range of languages in which its publications are issued ; by issuing a Monthly- Bulletin which should serve as an official gazette or. journal officiel; by pro-ducing a Handbook of National Commissions ; by introducing new features of popular interest in the Courier and by intensifying efforts to promote itscirculation and sale ; by summoning a small conference of newspaper editorsand proprietors in the hope of increasing their interest and enlisting their advice in the public relations work of UNESCO and finally by the develop-ment of a panel of qualified lecturers. Reference should also be made tothe Conference resolution on the translation^ distribution and sale of UNESCO documents and publications in languages other than the work-ing languages which authorised the use of an appropriation of $20,000 tofacilitate the printing of translations of certain UNESCO publications inArabic in 1949. .136. Although in its four meetings the Committee of Fifteen performedcertain very necessary tasks, the United Kingdom Delegation consider thatthey might equally well have been remitted to the Official and external relations Commission and the Administrative Commission. It doubts there-fore whether it will be found necessary or desirable to repeat the experimentof such a tripartite Committee in future conferences.7. OTHER RESOLUTIONS OF THE GENERALCONFERENCE137. Introduction.-Apart from the resolutions which the Conferenceadopted on the reports of its various Commissions, Sub-Commissions and committees, a number of other decisions were taken, many of them impor-tant, by the Conference sitting in plenary session. These are recorded fully in the official proceedings of the Conference. We wish now to draw attentiononly to the few which appear to us to require additional comment.138. Admission of New Members to UNESCO.-At the opening of theConference there were forty-four Member States in UNESCO. During theConference, Switzerland announced that its Government, already a memberof the United Nations Organisation, had agreed to ratify the Constitution of UNESCO, thus bringing the membership to forty-five. Since the end ofthe Conference, SJam formally joined the Organisation on 1st January, 1949.A list of the Member States of UNESCO is given in Appendix III.139. As already reported in paragraphs 110-112, the Conference, judgingthat Monaco, however small, was a sovereign state in its own right and thatit had a national contribution to make towards education, science andculture, voted unanimously to admit Monaco as a full member of theOrganisation.140. Election of New Members of the Executive Board. Six members ofthe Board retired during the Conference in accordance with the principlesof the Constitution. They were all re-elected with the exception of Dr. JanOpocensky (Czechoslovakia) who declined re-election. In his jplace, theGeneral Conference, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee,elected Count Stefano Jacini (Italy).
141. Two other members were elected to fill vacancies, M. Roger Seydoux(France) in place of Professor Auger (France), resigned, for the one yearYunexpired term of Professor Auger&apos;s period of office, and Dr. GuillemoNanetti (Colombia) for the two years&apos; unexpired term of office of Dr.Benjamin Carrion (Ecuador) who had resigned owing to pressure of other duties. A^omplete list of members of the Executive Board is given inAppendix IV. .142. The Conference was presented with an unusual candidature of amember of an absent Delegation. Shortly before the elections to the vacantplaces on the Board, a telegram was received from Prague stating that the czechoslovak Government had constituted a Delegation which, however,would be unable to attend the Conference and asking that its leader, Dr.Hofmeister, should be accepted as the Czechoslovak candidate for election.The matter was referred to the Credentials Committee who agreed that the credentials could be accepted from which it followed that Dr. Hofmeisterqualified as a candidate under Article V of the Constitution. He was accordingly proposed for election but was unsuccessful.143. Fourth and Fifth Sessions of the General Conference. The UnitedKingdom Delegation to the Extraordinary Session of the General Conferenceon 15th September, 1948, announced that H.M. Government would urge that annual conferences, beginning with the Fourth Session, should bereduced every other year Jo short business conferences held in Paris, andthat a full Conference in another centre should occur once in two yearsinstead of annually as at present. The reason for this change in present practice was to save the time and expense incurred by moving large numbersof the Secretariat away from their work in Paris together with Delegationsfrom Member States.144. At the same time it was recommended that the time of the year inwhich the General Conference should meet should be changed from the last half to the first half of each year in order to make it easier for persons inacademic life to attend and to adjust unescos activities more closely withthose of the United Nations.145. Submitted again to the Third Session these proposals were adopted.It was agreed that the Fourth Session of the Conference should be a shortbusiness Conference to be held in Paris in the early autumn of 1949. Thechange in the date was postponed until the following year for which theItalian Delegation generously invited the Fifth Session of the conference to meet in Florence in the spring of 1950. Although the Third Sessioncould not finally commit the Fourth Session to accept this offer (becausethe Constitution reserves the power of determining the site of the next con-ference to the immediately preceding Conference), it nevertheless recom-mended provisional acceptance.146. Delegates were unwilling to omit from the business Conferences all matters likely to arouse public interest and the Conference accordinglyresolved that a discussion on one or more general subjects of popular appeal should be planned and that eminent personalities should be asked to attend!the Fourth Session.
