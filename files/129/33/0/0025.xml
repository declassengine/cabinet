&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 194$SECRET Copy No.3 iC-Pi (48) 6S\5th March, 1949GABlNETSALE OF H.M.S. &quot; AJAX h- TO CHILEMemorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyWhen; in D.O. (48) 41 of 5th July; 1948,1 invited my colleagues oh $he DefenceCommittee to consider the sale of H.M.S. A jaw to the Government of Chile, no firihoffer had beerl made for the ship. I asked for agreement to negotiate the salefor a sum of approximately  710,000; inclusive of stores and refit. *2. On 2lst July, 1948, the Committee agreed (D.O. (48) 12th Meeting,Minute 4) that the proposal should be reconsidered in the near future (because itwas then hoped that a new situation in the Antarctic would shortly eliminatesome of the objections that had been raised by the Opposition in the House ofCommons the previous day (Hansard, 20th July, 1948, columns 361-364) ). this proved impracticable because the political situation did not clarify quicklyenough and also for the reasons explained below.3. It became clear that the work of refitting the ship cOuld not be undertaken in the Royal Dockyards. Without prejudice to the eventual decision of theGovernment, the Chilean Naval Attach! was therefore informed in September&apos;last that the ship would have to be sold &quot; as she lies &quot;; that the Chilean Gdverh-ment would have to make arrangements for the refit themselves, either in thiscountry or elsewhere; and that the refit could not be expected to take less than twoyears or to cost less than  500,000. The sale price of the ship tinder this arrange-ment was put (after correspondence with the Treasury) at  200^000.4. On the Chilean side, a rather complex situation arose. Discussion of thepurchase of H.M.S. A jaw was to have taken a decisive step forward in the latter part of October 1048; but a serious financial scandal in the Ministry of Marinecaused this to be postponed. During November and December, however, the chilean Naval authorities succeeded in persuading their Government to instruct their Ambassador in London to ask His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;whether theywill sell the ship or hot &quot;; the reason for this form of approach was an under-standable reluctance to waste time and money on survey of the ship, and prepara-tion of estimates for refit, if the projected sale were eventually to be cancelled byHis Majesty&apos;s&apos; Government.5. Further consideration of the matter in London was deferred while experi-etice could be gained of Chilean Naval activities in the Antarctic during thecurrent season. As the Chileans appear to be honouring satisfactorily their agreement not to make &quot; demonstrations,&quot; the way now seems clear for at least a decision whether to sell the ship or not a decision which cannot, I consider,reasonably be delayed any longer.6.   The arguments in favour of this sale appear to me to be as follows.7. First, in the words I used last July (D.O. (48) 41, paragraph 4 (a)) &quot; ourrelations with the Chilean Navy are uniformly good. My colleagues are probablyaware that the small Chilean Navy is patterned on the Royal Navy; we have had a friendly interest in the Chilean Navy for over a hundred years and would wishthis interest to continue. Nothing could affect these relations more favourablythan the transfer of such an historic warship, particularly as the victory for which she is most renowned took place in South American waters.&quot; This Naval con-nection has been allowed considerable weight in the past. After the First World36740
War, when the pro-German tendencies of the Chilean Government were, poh-tically, a more serious objection than the Antarctic trouble is to-day, HisMajesty&apos;s Government nevertheless offered to sell to Chile two of the battle cruisers, in addition to the battleship and destroyers which were^ bought by thatcountry in substitution for warships under construction for them here in 1914.8.- Second, from the economic point of view, the &quot; dollar-earning capacity&quot;of H.M.S. Ajax is not limited to the  200,000 that may be paid for her &quot; as shelies.&quot; It is virtually impossible for Chile to have her refitted outside the UnitedKingdom for her passage into the Pacific, and every indication of Chileanintentions in this matter points to a British firm. The initial refit may wellcost &amp;\ million. Again, the sale of stores for dollars to the value of million isan important consideration. Finally, the sale of H.M.S. A jaoc to Chile mustmean a continuing demand here for spares and services, all of which will bepaid for in hard currency.9. The arguments that could be brought to bear against the sale are alsotwofold.10. First, the strategic importance of the Chilean. Navy is admittedly almostnegligible to us in peace or in war. On the other hand, the maintenance of British influence ill that service, is of potential value in respect of possible-future ordersfor warships or Naval material. This factor is the more significant since the chilean Government are under continual temptation to accept United Statesguidance and help, rather than British-a temptation which, however, they appeardetermined to resist so long as they can. This has very recently been confirmed by our Ambassador (Santiago telegrams Nos. 58, 59 and 61 of 21st and 23rd February,1949).11. Second, although the Chileans have shown some restraint in the antarctic this &quot; summer,&quot; they are still in occupation of British territory. (This,however, is territory in respect of which American proposals for some form ofinternationalisation have already been accepted by Ministers as a satisfactory basis for discussion. While the sale of H.M.S. A jaw to Chile would, of course, be nocondonement or encouragement of any illegalities in the Antarctic, a public refusal to sell the ship which could only be based on a supposed connection between this transaction and Antarctic policy might cause a worsening of Anglo-Chileanrelations and consequently increase the difficulty of reaching a reasonable solutionof outstanding differences.)12. The question has to be decided in the light of the fact that in answer toa public announcement that H.M.S. Ajax is to be sold to Chile, the opposition in the House of Commons will undoubtedly revert to the line taken in the Adjourn-ment Debate on 20th July, 1948 (Hansard, columns 361 and following), which is substantially the argument which I have dealt with in the preceding paragraph,namely, the impropriety of selling a famous British warship to a foreign power which is &quot;illegally in occupation of British territory.&quot; As indicated, I considerthat there is a sound answer to this line of argument, but it is apparent that thereis quite strong feeling in the matter in both Houses; moreover, when the subject was mentioned again in Parliament as recently as the Debate in the House ofCommons on the Navy Estimates on 8th March, there was evidence that this feeling-existed not Only on the Opposition side but among Government supporters too.13. I invite my colleagues therefore to consider, in the light of the possiblepolitical difficulty here at home, whether the balance of advantage lies in sellingH.M.S. Ajax to the Chilean Government. It will, of course, be understood thatthe vessel will be scrapped if not sold.A dmiralty, S.W.1,15th March, 1949.
