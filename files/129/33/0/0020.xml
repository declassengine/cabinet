HIS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP KI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT   printed for the Cabinet.   Marpfy 1949QQNFipENTIALQ,f ] (49) 609*A march , 1949EUROPEAN CEMETERIES IN INDIA AND PAKISTANNote by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, I attach, for the information of my colleagues a draft nf n Qtaf&amp;mMrf vP. J, N-BCommonwealth. Relations Office,, S. W.1,9th Mamh, 1949.DRAFT STATEMENTEuropean Cemeteries in India and, Pakistan[My Lords :Many Members of Your Lordships&apos; House will, I think, be concerned to knowKvhat arrangenaents are contemplated for the care of European cemeteries in Indiaand Pakistan. Your Lordships will be aware, that, as a. result of the transfer)f power, European cemeteries maintained in the past&apos; by the Government of Indialave become, since April last the responsibility of the United Kingdom Goyern-nerit. Since that date they have been maintained largely at the expense of UnitediingciQm revenues,. With Your Lordships&apos; permission I &apos;will outline briefly theirrangements proposed for their future maintenance.I should first explain that before 1948 the maintenance of these cemeteriesvas(supervised, by the government of India through the Public Works Depart-aent, the Military Engineering Service, or the Railway Board, as appropriate,tor this purpose Indian expenditure amounted to  45,000 a year apart from the proceeds of income from private endowments. The cemeteries, numbered over,3,50, of which about 350 are open for further burials. A considerable numberf the remainder are not cemeteries in the strict sense, but merely groups of graves,If ten by the roadside, in remote places. Many of the cemeteries date from aistant past and have had no burials in them for generations.Your Lordships will, I am sure; appreciate that a full-scale maintenance of,11 these cemeteries would be a formidable commitment, and I am bound quitejrankly to admit that we shall riot&apos;be able to continue to maintain some of thelemeteries on the old standards; indeed, there are certain cemeteries that we shallpt be able to maintain to any extent. Nevertheless I hope to satisfy YouriiOrdships that the Government are doing what they can to secure that wherecemeteries cannot be maintained^ their preservation will be safeguarded so far mfccal circumstances permit. In such cases our aim would be to secure that theyTiould revert to nature in a dignified and decent mariner. In respect of the rest,36699
I hope also to satisfy Your Lordships that our proposals are as reasonable and appropriate as most of us can expect. 1, ii;Manifestly our High Commissioners are unable to maintain an organisation for the care of these graves comparable with that of the old style Governmentof India; It is on members of the Christian congregations resident in India and pakistan that: the local task of caring for Christian graveyards must howprimarily devolve. ; In many places the Christian Churches now. find theirEuropean congregations depleted or non-existent. Thanks, however, I am happy to say, to the authorities of the Christian Churches, and to many members of boththe European and local communities, a number of voluntary bodies have been formedwho have undertaken to care for our graves. I am sure that Your Lordshipswould desire to be associated with His Majesty&apos;s Government in: commendingthose who have undertaken this invaluable and generously given help.So far some 312 voluntary local Cemetery Committees have been formed.They include representatives of the Clergy, local industry or business, the UnitedKingdom Citizens&apos; Association, and the Anglo-Indian Association, and theywill undertake local supervision of the work of maintaining the cemeteries. Incertain areas, however, the local body will consist, through force of circumstances,of only a, solitary missionary or local Christian. Hitherto the Committees havebeen in direct correspondence with the High Commissions, but this is not a practicable long-term arrangement, and it is intended to set up, generally on a .Provincial basis, a number of Trustee Boards to act as a link between theCommittees and the High Commissions., The Trustee Boards will generallyco-ordinate and supervise the work of the Committees. They will be composedof senior representatives of the religious denominations concerned, prominentlocal members of the Province and, wherever possible, the Deputy United kingdom high Commissioner in the area.Turning now to the future method of upkeep of the cemeteries, I should explain that these have been considered broadly under two heads, namely, opencemeteries, which are those still used for burials, and closed cemeteries. since 1st April, our High Commissioners have been in the closest consultation with thevarious Church authorities in India and Pakistan, whose attitude, I can gratefullysay, has been both realistic and helpful. We have also been fortunate in obtaining the views of a number of former Secretaries of State, Viceroys, Commanders-in-Chief, Provincial Governors and others, as well as of the Ecclesiasticalauthorities mainly concerned. May I, on the Government&apos;s behalf, take this opportunity of thanking all these eminent persons for so readily assisting us with their counsel ? I do not claim that the proposals which I am about to describe received their unanimous approval, but I can at least assure your lordships that a substantial majority of those consulted, including therepresentatives of the Churches, are generally in favour of proceeding on the lines which the Government have now decided to follow. ;As regards the open cemeteries, the Church authorities have said that itis their avowed object, with the help of income from endowments and burial fees,to maintain them in a suitable manner. It may well be that at the outset Churchfunds will not be wholly sufficient for the purpose^ and that they will have to rely on the High Commissioners for small subventions. It has also been decidedthat the more important historically of the closed cemeteries should be cared forin the same way. These include, for example, the cemeteries at the KashmariGate in Delhi and St. John&apos;s in Calcutta.It is with regard to &quot;the thousand or so closed cemeteries that different con-siderations arise. They are, of course, of all sizes and they are to be foundall over the sub-continent, from Gilgit in the far north of Kashmir, to theAndamans. A number of them, perhaps about 100, lie in areas where it hasnot been possible to form Committees, for example, in certain of the TribalTerritories, remote districts and ancient camping grounds. These, with howevergreat reluctance, we feel compelled to leave to revert to nature, along with certainisolated groups of graves. Assurances, however, have been received for whichthe United Kingdom Government are grateful to the Governments of India .and Pakistan and to the Provincial Governments concerned. The Governmentof India say they will protect cemeteries from destruction and desecration in thesame way as property belonging to the Government themselves. The Governmentof Pakistan have also issued instructions that the cemeteries in Pakistan areto be protected from encroachment and desecration. As to the majority of theclosed cemeteries, it has been decided, after mature consideration, that they should
be attended to at intervals, as distinct from constant maintenance, and that thisattention will continue for as long as funds will last. This,is expected to be for at least ten years and.perhaps for an appreciable time longer.;.To meet the cost ot attending periodically to. closed cemeteries, and to provide some initial assistance to the Churches in caring for the open cemeteries, Parlia-ment will in due course be asked to provide a lump sum to be placed in trust tobe drawn on as required by the trustees^ who will include the High Commissioners.Provision on maintenance for the interim period has been made in the 1949-50 :Estimates for the Commonwealth Services. The capital sum is, of course, quiteseparate from the private endowment funds in the hands of the two governments which are shortly to be transferred to our High Commissioners. The interest from .these endowment funds, in so far as it pertains to the open cemeteries and tothe closed cemeteries of historical importance, will, of course,, continue to be applied in the manner intended. But in the case of the majority.of the closed cemeteriesit will not be practical, under the arrangements contemplated, to apply the interest on endowment funds precisely in accordance with the original intentions. Wherethe money cannot be used for the upkeep of these cemeteries the most equitablecourse, subject to the express wish of any individual who has endowed a gravelocated, in a closed cemetery to have a local record of the grave maintained^ willprobably be found to lie in its use for the assistance of the Churches in themaintenance of the open cemeteries.I trust that I have satisfied actorily explained to Your Lordships the decisions reached in this important matter. It has not, of course, been possible in a brief statement such as this to cover all the points that arise, but on one specific matterof wide interest I should add that war graves continue, as in the past, to be theresponsibility of the Imperial War Graves Commission.
