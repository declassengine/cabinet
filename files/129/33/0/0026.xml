Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1949SECRET Copy. No.    vCP. (49) 6615th March, 1949CABINETTHE FILM industry memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeDURING the last few weeks my colleagues will have observed the references in the Press to the difficulties of the film production industry in this countryand the consequent closing down of various studios and the dismissal or threateneddismissal of a very considerable number of workers employed in them. I thinkit may be useful to trace briefly the history of the industry since the end ofthe war, and to set put the main causes that have contributed to the presentrecession, and the measures that have been and are being taken to put matterson a better and more stable footing.2. While the industry is generally prone to exaggeration and the word&quot; crisis &quot; is often used in it to denote any event that may attract the attentionof the Press, it must be admitted that there exists to-day serious under-employmentof the resources of film production. Its extent can be gauged by the followingparticulars. A year ago there were nineteen first-feature films in productionand approximately 7,-250 workers in employment in the studios. To-day thenumber of first-feature films in production is ten, and the number of workersin employment is below 6,000, and if all the notices that have been already givenare allowed to take effect, this total will be reduced before long to about 4,500.3. After the conclusion of hostilities, the re-expansion of film production to peace-time levels proceeded without interruption.. By the Spring of 1947 mostof the chief products for studio rehabilitation had been carried out, and the activity of the industry was such that shortage of studio space constituted thechief obstacle to increased production. It is true that costs were rising steadily,but attendances in the cinema were still maintained at war-time levels, and therewas a general atmosphere of optimism not only in the industry itself, but alsoamong those who provided it with finance.4. It was at this point that, as one of the measures to meet the dollarcrisis, an import duty was imposed on foreign films designed to absorb 75 per cent,of, their earnings in the United Kingdom. The results of this action were most fortunate for, our producers. The American industry chose to regard theduty as an act of war against-themselves. They ceased to import new films,and settled down to make and transfer in dollars as much as possible from thefilms they already had in store here. As a corollary to this policy they ceasedpractically all participation in United Kingdom production, and offers of screentime on the other side of the Atlantic which had recently been made to the RankOrganisation were withdrawn.5.   At the beginning of 1948, therefore, there was already a small amountof idle studio space due to the cessation of American-sponsored production.   Theslack thus created was not being taken up by additional British production,although it might have been thought that the cessation of American imports pro-vided an unprecedented opportunity for the British industry.   On the contrary,I   there were distinct signs that it was becoming steadily more difficult to obtain evenI   the finance needed to maintain the existing level.   It was evident that the existingI   supply of American films would not last more than about nine months, and that36742THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
when it had been used up a considerable number of cinemas would have to closedown. Further, it was by no means certain that the cinemas able to remain openwould provide an adequate market for maintaining film production in the homestudios.6. In March 1948 through the good offices of the American Ambassador,discussions were started with the accredited representatives of the Americanindustry and resulted in an Agreement which I signed on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on 12th March. This Agreement provided for the withdrawal of theimport duty and the resumption of American film imports on condition thattransfers of American film revenues would be limited to 17 million dollars perannum, plus a sum in dollars equal to the amount earned by British producers fromthe exhibition of British films in the United States. The&quot; Agreement also dealt insome detail with the various ways in which the American revenues blocked herecould be used. It was to run for two years from 14th June, 1948, with the possi-bility of renewal with or without amendment for a further period of two years ending in June 1952.7. The Agreement was heartily disliked by the American industry, since itmeant that they must forego the transfer in dollars of nearly two-thirds of their earnings from their most important foreign market at a time when their ownfinancial position was such that they could ill spare a single dollar. The positionof the Hollywood companies has steadily declined and presents to-day a much worse picture of idle studios and redundant workers than can be.seen here. Atfirst it seemed possible that they might attempt to use their blocked sterling toswamp our native production industry, but other counsels prevailed, and they have in fact adopted rather a negative attitude, though there has recently been moreproduction activity based upon the use of blocked sterling. This general lack of concern over the disposal of their blocked funds may perhaps be attributed to pre-occupation with their major financial troubles at home, but it is remarkable thatthey have made no effort to increase the United States earnings of British filmsalthough this would mean the release to them of additional dollars. This must be attributed to deliberate policy. Since the Agreement started to operate, the americans have found additional cause for complaint in the 45 per cent, quotafixed under the Films Act for British first feature films, and the position tb-day is that the exhibition of British films in the United States is almost confined to afew films like &quot; Hamlet,&quot; &quot; Red Shoes,&quot; or &quot; Oliver Twistj&quot; which can be shown for long runs in individual theatres.8. Thus, the Agreement, though it restored the supply of films and enabled the cinemas to keep open, brought no alleviations of the difficulties of the Britishproducer. The absence of any real share in the United States market, the growingamount of working capital tied up in individual films as a consequence of this,the known embarrassment of the two chief producing firms and the fact that oneof these had produced no less than three of the most expensive films, none of which seemed likely to earn its cost at the box office all this was reflected in the ever-increasing reluctance of private finance to participate in the industry, and it was clear that positive steps would be needed if collapse was to be avoided.9. I have referred to the lack of film revenues from the United States, butthe Continental market is for quite different reasons equally disappointing. Ourfilms to-day enjoy in Europe a reputation which they have never had before, butcurrency and other restrictions prevent us from enjoying the fruits of it. hence the cash export value of a good film to-day is only  30,000- 40,000, the bulk ofwhich comes from the other Commonwealth countries. The money these filmsare earning in France, Germany and Italy, if we could transfer it, would go far to make us independent of the American market, and I am keeping a close watchupon this whole problem, particularly in Germany, which is individually far themost important. This limitation of the returns from export has fallen withparticular force on the Rank Organisation, which has been the main support ofBritish film production, being responsible for more than half of the total annual output. It has been an essential feature of Mr. Rank&apos;s policy to secure a footingin the United States market for his major productions, which have been budgetedwith this expectation in view. The failure to obtain a reasonable revenue fromthis source or from the main European countries has meant a steady increase inthe amount of money locked up in celluloid, and this has now reached the point
at which he is compelled to draw in his horns and to make fewer and cheaperfilms, using every possible device of economy.in budgeting and improvement intechnique. This policy is inevitably reflected in the closing down of the lesseconomic studios and the discharge of redundant workers. While he will no doubtcontinue to produce each year a substantial number of films, it does not look as if for the next year or two he will occupy the central position in the industry thathe has hitherto held, and it may be that he will never attempt to regain it.10. I come now to the positive steps that are being taken to help the industryto set its house in order and to achieve something more nearly approaching stabilitythan it has ever enjoyed in the past. Early in 1948 I had set up a national film Production Council composed of representatives of the film producers andthe Trade Unions catering for studio employment, under my Chairmanship. Myobject in setting up this body was to secure better co-operation between the two sides of the industry in bringing the level of production costs into some sort ofequilibrium with prospective earnings. After a good deal of hesitation on thepart of the producers, who are traditionally most unwilling to make anything in the way of production figures available to the Trade Unions, there has nowbeen set up a Working Party on Film Production Costs of which Sir George Gateris Chairman and which will be reporting to the Council before very long. I regard the task of this Working Party as fundamental. The extravagance of the film industry is proverbial and much of the criticism is justified. Not only will the City hold completely aloof from the industry unless it can be shown to.betaking radical measures to eliminate waste, but even such limited assistance asthe Government is giving will be liable to criticism so long as it can be said thatwe are merely underwriting the continued supply of fur coats and other luxuriesto the film moguls. At the same time it must be realised that a certain degree ofextravagance is probably inseparable from this industry. Every film is an adven-ture and any attempt to tie down too tightly the somewhat flamboyant personalitiesconcerned is more than likely to end in the production of bad films and the lossof what has been spent on them.11. In September of the same year, after serious but abortive attempts to persuade the City to undertake the task of bringing about a measure of order and stability in this industry, the National Film Finance Company was set up underthe Borrowing and Guarantees Act, and will be replaced by a National FilmFinance Corporation with borrowing powers of  5 million under an Act whichhas just received Royal Assent. The interim Company has been instrumental in keeping under way a significant volume of film production which could not havebeen financed without it, and I have reason to think that the establishment of theCorporation, with its rather wider powers of lending, will lead to the productionof a number of new films which will do something to mitigate the recent increasein unemployment. Nevertheless, it must be appreciated that a revolving fund of 5 million is not a large total in relation to the needs of this industry as a whole,and it will almost certainly be necessary to return to Parliament for an increasein the borrowing powers before we can regard the problem as solved. I oughtto make it clear that the main function of this Corporation is to provide what is really the equity capital needed in film production. The preference capital, whichis roughly 70-75 per cent, of the whole, is ordinarily provided by Joint StockBanks against guarantees of distribution by reputable firms. Latterly there hasbeen some tendency on the part of the Banks to restrict or even to discontinue their participation in this business, but I am hopeful that this attitude can be correctedand that other Banks can be persuaded to take up this business in addition to thetwo that have hitherto carried almost the whole burden.12. Furthermore, in fulfilment of an undertaking given to Parliament inconnection with the recent Cinematograph Films Act, the present structure of theindustry and the relationship between the three sections producers, renters andexhibitors of which it is composed, is now being studied by a Departmental Com-mittee under the Chairmanship of Lord Portal of Laverstoke. Much has beenheard of the relatively small, share of the box office takings that accrues to the producer compared with that taken by the exhibitor and even more by the state in the form of Entertainment Duty. This is a problem to which that Committeeis giving considerable thought, and it is also considering whether the presentsystem of releasing films for exhibition to the public is susceptible of improvementin the interests either of the producer or of the general public.
13. It may be asked why the protective legislation which the industry hasenjoyed for the last twenty years in the shape of three successive cinematograph films Acts has not succeeded in assuring to it a sounder basis of existence. while some form of quota legislation is essential to prevent our industry from beingswamped by the larger and stronger industry centred in Hollywood, it can clearly not do more than assure to British films a certain proportion of the screen timein bur own country. At the same time, if they are to hold their own they must com-pete in quality with the American film based upon a home market of 17,000 cinemasand 80,000,000 weekly attendances. I had hoped that, by fixing the first year&apos;squota under the new Act for first feature films at the high figure of 45 per cent.,I should have provided all those interested in film production with an incentive to expand and improve their output to the maximum possible extent. This incen-tive has not been sufficient, in face of the adverse factors to which I have referred,to maintain the financial support required for the industry; but I am satisfiedthat it has removed one very serious obstacle in the path of free-lance production,namely, the uncertainty of securing a booking from one of the three major cinemagroups.14. I think it will be obvious from the foregoing that just as a number ofcauses have contributed to the present difficulties of the industry, so there is noone remedy that can be applied, but a cure can only be brought about by a numberof measures each making its own contribution. The chief of these may be listedas follows : (a) The problem of costs must be tackled seriously in all its aspects.    Thisis fundamental to the health of the industry. It is now in handthrough the Gater Working Party.(b) Everything possible must be done to increase film earnings abroad andto increase the proportion of those earnings remitted here. So far asEurope is concerned the major difficulties are those ofvcurrencytransfer, and my Department is now discussing with the Treasury andthe Foreign Office the steps that can be taken to increase transfers.Progress in the United States must wait upon some new settlement with the American industry, for which the time is, in my view, notyet ripe.(c) Action, possibly legislative, may have to be taken as soon as we know theviews of the Portal Committee on whether the producer is getting afair share of the box-office takings, and if not, how his share could beincreased.(d) Proper provision must be made to ensure that finance is available on a stable basis and reasonable terms, preferably from private channels,but if necessary by continuing the existence and increasing the lendingpower of the Finance Corporation.H.
