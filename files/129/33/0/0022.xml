HIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1949187SECRETCopy No.31CP. (49) 6210*a March, 1949.CABINETCONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT  IN  SMALLER  COLONIALTERRITORIES1. Tfre annexed paper C.A. (48) 19 (Annex A) was considered by theCommonwealth Affairs Committee on 19th January (OA. (49) 1st Meeting). TheCommittee endorsed the proposal that an enquiry should be carried out into thequestion of constitutional development in the smaller Colonial territories and invited me to submit detailed proposals to the Cabinet regarding the constitution and terms of reference of a Committee to undertake this investigation and theprocedure which they should follow.2. The Commonwealth Affairs Committee noted that the Colonial territoriesfall into three main classes : (i) Those which are potentially capable of achieving responsible Govern-ment;(ii) Those which can combine to form units capable of responsible Govern-ment; and(iii) Those which fall into neither of the above categories.3. In regard to category (ii), considerable progress (of which examples are given in paragraph 5 of the annexed paper) has been made in associatingBritish Colonial territories together in geographical regions. That processcontinues. But in a number of small territories internal constitutional develop-I ments have gone forward ad hoc. While these developments have engaged theI constant attention of the Colonial Governments concerned and the Colonial Office,the ultimate structure and status of these territories has not been the subjectof an enquiry, nor has there been any comprehensive study of the constitutionalproblems or of such questions as whether developments have been based on rightprinciples, whether political and legal institutions are growing up on the linesmust suitable to the needs of the individual peoples, and how far genuine localgovernment is being made the foundation for further constitutional growth.4.   I recommend that the terms of reference of the new Committee should be as follows : (i) To enquire into the present constitutional position of the smallerColonial territpries* and the probable trend of their future political development, and in particular,(a) to examine the suitability of various modes of constitutionalstructure and to consider whether it is desirable or practicable to define the ultimate constitutional objective in the case ofparticular territories or to lay down any general principles onwhich policy should be based;(b) to examine the relationship of individual territories towards eachOther and towards the United Kingdom and to consider how far,by strengthening these relationships or by other means, it mayMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies* Listed in Annex B to this memorandum.36718b
be possible to mitigate the parochialism and other handicapsto which&apos; small and isolated5 communities may be subject andto give the Colonial peoples a genuine sense of partnership inthe Commonwealth; ,(c) to consider how far the present political, legal and administrativestructures within the territories make for healthy; politicalgrowth, and for efficiency and economy in administration; andin particular whether by adopting simpler formsi: of^Gbverh1-ment (such as following the pattern of municipal or localGovernment rather than the Parliamentary model), or by other1 means, unnecessary extravagence may be avoided, higher standards of efficiency attained, or fusion or combination madeeasier.(ii) To make recommedations in the light of these enquiries.5. The Committee should consist of an unofficial Chairman, three pr fourpersons of experience in political and constitutional matters, the Legal adviser to the Colonial Office and Commonwealth Relations Office, and a senior admin-istrative officer of the Colonial Office.6, For the reasons given in paragraph 10 of the annexure, the enquiry should, at any rate for the time being, be conducted in the strictest confidence.11 suggest that the Committee should be left to determine its own prpcecjure,bearing in mind that secrecy, at least in the eiariy stages, is essentiaj&apos;^nd isdesirable throughout. Visits^ ]to individual Colonies at a Uxter stage&apos; may wel)be found necessary, but this should be considered iii the light of the initial progress made with, the enquiry and the situation in the particular territories at fixe time.A.

Commonwealth Affairs CommitteeCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN SMALLER COLONIALTERRITORIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State, for the Colonies1. At their 8th Meeting the Committee invited me to consider, and to circulate a paper dealing with, a proposal that an enquiry should be undertakeninto the question of constitutional development in the smaller Colonial territories.2. The latest general statement of our constitutional objectives is asfollows: &quot; The central purpose of British Colonial Policy is simple. It is to guide the Colonial territories to responsible self-government within the Common-wealth in conditions that ensure to the people concerned both a fair standardof living and freedom from oppression from any quarter.&quot; (Cmd. 7433,paragraph 3.)3. This statement embodies, by implication the obvious truth that full independence can be achieved only if a territory is economically viable and capableof defending its own interests. In fact, Colonial territories can be placed in three classes :-(1) Those which are potentially capable of achieving full independence;(2) Those which can combine with others to form units capable of full independence;(3) Those which fall into neither of the above categories..4. This paper is concerned chiefly with the third class. But I should pointout that constitutional progress has been going on over the whole colonial fieldat an ever quickening pace during the last decade. These internal developments have gone forward ad hoc, and their pace has depended upon social and political conditions in the individual territories and not upon extraneous considerationssuch as are involved when the question of granting &quot; Dominion status&quot; arises.Changes in the political institutions of a territory have sometimes followed onthe recommendations of Commissions, but, broadly, the individual position ofeach territory has been under the constant review of the Governor and theColonial Office. Considerable thought has also been given to the grouping of territories, but the ultimate constitutional status of certain of the smaller terri-tories has not been the subject of any enquiry.5. My colleagues will know that some consideration was given to the grouping of territories by the Coalition Government, and much progress has beenmade since then. The form which grouping takes has varied according to thecircumstances of each case.  The principal developments are : (a) West A african Council (includes Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone andGambia). No executive powers, but it secures co-ordination for certaincommon services and regional problems (e.g., research, transport,security, &amp;c).(*) East A frica Commission (includes Uganda, Kenya, Tanganyika). Execu-tive power in respect of transport, research, economic regional develop-ment, &amp;c.36718 B secret[G. A. (48) 198th December, 1948]CABINET
(c) Central Africa Council (includes Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia,Nyasaland). Advisory council of representatives of these three governments. Develops certain common services and co-ordinatespolicy, e.g., labour, communications. .t(d) West Indian Development and Welfare Organisation, for advising andstimulating British West Indian Governments. The CaHbbedn-Com^mission, representative of United States, France, Holland and UnitedKingdom also exists for advisory services and achieves a degree ofco-operation in the Caribbean.. A movement towards federation ofthe British West Indian &quot;territories is being pursued as a result ofthe Montego Bay Conference last year.(e) South-East A sia (North Borneo, Sarawak, Brunei, Singapore and Malaya).A central government for the Malay States, &amp;c, has been achieved.A Commissioner-General in South-East Asia has been appointed.(/) South Pacific Commission (includes Fiji, Western PacificHighponuiiissionTerritories and Kingdom of Tonga). A consultative ami&apos; advisory body, comprising representatives of the Netherlands, France, UnitedKingdom, United States, Australia and New Zealand, in matters affecting the economic and social development of the territories con-&quot; cerned and the welfare and advancement of their peoples.&apos; &apos; - ,6.-&apos; Of the Colonial territories as at present organised, it is hardly likely that full self-government will be achieved under any foreseeable conditions ^part from association with other territories) by any except Nigeria, the Gold-Coast,and the. Federation of Malaya with Singapore. There are also territories where our aim is to promote closer union or federation in order that units capable of independence may be built up: (a) South-East Asia, (6) Caribbean Colonies,(*) East and Central Africa Territories.7.   I refer now to the smaller Colonies,(i) -In Africa ,(a) Gambia.   Is part of the West African Council ahd in severalseryices is associated with Sierra Leone.      ,(&amp;) Somaliland.   Has affinities with both Kenya and Aden.    .i(   -\c) High C6inmissi6ner&apos;s Territories in South Africa (dealt with %&apos;   the Commonwealth Relations Office),(ii) In Mediterranean (a) Malta.  Enjoys internal responsibility.(b) Cyprus.  Constitution in abeyance.(c) Gibraltar. New Constitution recently considered.(iii) In Indian Ocean-(a) Aden[In each case minor constitutional changes havey ) ^^u,rii&apos;!us f       been made in recent years.(c) Seychelles......    J J(d) Maidive Islands. A Sultanate under British protection (nowunder the Commonwealth Relations Office).(e) [The Sultanate of.Muscat. (Oman) and the Sheikdoms of kuwait and Bahrein ought perhaps to be included in this list. Theseare independent States to which British protection is affordedthrough the Foreign Office.](iv) A atlantic Ocean  :(a) Bermuda and Bahamas. They have incieht Constitutions con-ferring fairly complete local government and are not likelyto seek an alteration of status.(b) St. Helena (with Ascension and Tristan da Cunha).(c) Falkland Islands (and Dependencies),(v) Pacific Ocean  ;(a) Hong Kong. ,(6) Fiji. It is doubtful if Fiji.should.be included in this list.Administration is assisted on education and medical side byiproximity of New Zealand. . .:(c) Western Pacific High Commission Territories (Gilbert and ElliceIslands, Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, Tonga, &amp;c). (In theNew Hebrides there is an Anglo-French Condominitiftia).
8. I agree that some enquiry should be made into the present situation of these smaller territories&apos; and the probable &quot;trend of their future political develop-ment. Such enquiry could advise whether it is practicable or desirable to define the ultimate objective in the case of particular terrtories or to lay down anygeneral principle on which policy sho^d ;ibre:based, to examine any practicalsteps which might be suggested for promoting healthy political progress, for mitigated-gating the parochialism and other evils to which small an^ isolated communitiesare subject, and for giving the peoples of these&quot;territories&quot;&quot;a genuine sense ofpartnership in the Commonwealth. Jt should also take account of experiments in the way of amalgamation which have been tried in the past (e-0-, Gambia andSierra Leone, Mauritius and Seychelles), and seek to discover whether the reasonsfor the abahdohinent of these experiments hold good in modern conditions: Itshould ronsilcte&apos;r! the present political&apos;/&apos;legal sthd administrative structures, andwhether by fusion or combination unnecessary waste may be avoided&apos; and a higher standard Of efficiency attained. l&quot;v &apos;9. I suggest that the enquiry should be conducted by a small working party of experts. Three should suffice : a Chairman from outside, with the legal adviser to the Colonial and Commonwealth Relations Offices and a senior administrativeofficer of the Colonial Office as members.10. I regard it as essential that the enquiry should be conducted on a strictly confidential basis and that the fact that it is taking place should not be publishedeven in official circles. Any hint which &quot;might reach the Colonies that such an.enquiry was proceeding could only raise undesirable speculations and lead to political agitation.      : &apos; - &apos;a. c, j. ;Colonial Office, -8th December, 1948appendixTerritory&apos; -&apos;  --or-AdenBahamasmti    a:.British Somaliland       ......BruneiCyprus    ......Falkland Islands excluding Depen-denciesFiji.........      ......Gambia   ...      .........Gibraltar......      ......Hong Kong       .........Mauritius............North Borneo    ...     ...St. Helena including Ascension Is.Sarawak   .........      ...Population731,000mainly Arabs80,600(62,300 Africans,^2,900 Europeans,5,400 other races)Areasq. miles112,0804,375StatusColony and ProtectorateColony700,000	68,000	: ProtectorateSomalis		48,000	2,226	Protected Statemainly Malays and Dyaks		449,500	3,584	Colonymainly Europeans		2,200	4,618	Colonymainly British and		Scandinavian		259,600	7,083	Colony(120,400 Indians,118,100 Fijians,4,600 Europeans,16,500 other races)249,300 4,132mainly Africans21,200 1 mainly Europeans1,800,000 391mainly Chinese.430,000 720(270,900 Indians,148,300 of European,African or mixed descent,10,800 Chinese)330,000 29,417mainly Borneans4,700 80mainly Europeans500,000 50,000mainly Malays and DyaksColony and ProtectorateColonyColonyColonyColonyColonyColony
