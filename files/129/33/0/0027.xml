B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,17th March, 1949.REPORT BY SIR WILLIAM STRANGI. IntroductoryI give below some notes on my recent journey in South-East Asia and theFar East. They are not exhaustive. It would be tedious to set down all thatI heard ov noted. What I have tried to do is to pick out the more importanttrends and note the more significant facts, not for the benefit of the specialistDepartments, but as being of possible interest to the general reader, who will,I hope, draw from this paper some impression of current preoccupations andthe play of forces in this important region. In the present introductory section make some more general observations. If I have, in places, strayed beyondthe strict limits of Foreign Office concern, I hope I may be excused.2. I had no other mission than to educate myself, to meet His Majesty&apos;representatives in the foreign countries visited, to tell them about developmentsat home, to give them a picture of the foreign situation as seen from europe and, generally, to demonstrate the interest of the Foreign Office in Far eastern and South-East Asian affairs. I spent some days each in Karachi, Delhi,Rangoon, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Batavia, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Shanghaiand Tokyo, and spent nights in transit at Alexandria and Calcutta. I had talks with the Heads of Missions and with their chief advisers, political, economic,financial, labour and information. I was received by the leading Ministers ineach of the countries visited. I made a point of meeting and talking to therepresentatives of Commonwealth countries, the United States, France, Beneluxand China. I saw leading members of the British Community in each place. TheBritish Chambers of Commerce at Hong Kong and Shanghai entertained me, andI addressed them. I walked through the offices of each of His Majesty&apos;s missions and spoke to as many members of the staff as possible, of all grades. At therequest of the Heads of the Mission I gave a talk to the members of the staff at Delhi and Tokyo; and at the request of the Commissioner-General for South-East Asia, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, I did the same at Bukit Serene to a party of British, Malayan and Chinese notables.3.   It will be observed that my journey, undertaken mostly by flying-boat,,covered the central and eastern parts of the sea-girt periphery, or what the36746 bSECRETCP. (49) 6717th March, 1949
geopoliticians call the Rimland, which skirts the Heartland of Europe and Asiawhich is at present in large measure under Soviet control, and the fate of thewestern part of which is now at issue in the current battle for Berlin. I was interested to find that the significance of that battle is not diminished but ratherenhanced when looked at from the Far East.4. The importance of our maintaining control of the periphery, which runs round from Oslo to Tokyo, of denying it to communism, and, if possible,defending it against military attack, needs no emphasis. Nor is it less important,from the point of view of the framing of policy, that we should try to look onthe periphery as a whole. I found the germ of this thought in the minds ofmany of our representatives, and also the thought that there should not onlybe a United Kingdom policy, but, if possible, a Commonwealth policy (in spiteof divergencies of outlook); and that that policy should, if possible, be concertedwith the United States, since American resources would be indispensable.5. In all this, the Indian sub-continent has a special importance. It liesat a place about half-way round the periphery. If India tends to look eastwards,Pakistan looks both east and west. The sub-continent should not be regarded in isolation as a separate section. India, in particular, has an important role toplay in peripheral politics1 as a Great Asian Power; as a possible member ofthe Commonwealth; as a country with whom the United Kingdom has now anopportunity to develop relations on a new basis; as a country with political,cultural and economic interests in South-East Asia, which we should try tocarry with us in the framing of policies and the development of action in that region. The Delhi Conferences on Indonesia and Burma may be pointers to thefuture.6. From this peripheral point of view, the establishment of the Middle EastOffice in Cairo and the Commissioner-General&apos;s Office in Singapore were movesin the right direction. The need for them has not diminished. I found the minds of some of His Majesty&apos;s Representatives turning in the direction of,say, yearly regional meetings of Heads of Missions, and of the association ofCommanders-in-Chief, Colonial Governors, and United Kingdom High Commis-sioners or their representatives in some measure, if possible, with such conferences.The suggested groupings for this purpose might be first, from Greece or Turkeyround to Pakistan, and secondly, from Pakistan to Japan. For the first groupor part of it, the suggestion would be for a meeting in London next summer. Forthe second, a meeting similar to that recently held in Singapore, but with moreextended membership than before, and some co-ordination with the similarconference of Colonial Governors. This would carry with it close contact betweenthe Foreign Office, Colonial Office and Commonwealth Relations Office in London.It would also be useful if senior.officials of the Foreign Office could visit South-East Asia and the Far East from time to time, possibly about the period of the singapore meetings.7. There is a good deal that is dark in the Far Eastern picture, but thereare some brighter features.  On the darker side are 1(a) the ever-present food shortage, which will be a long-term problem forIndia and Japan and may be an immediate one for Shanghai if UnitedStates assistance is cut short;(6) the present disorders in Burma, Malaya, Indonesia and Indo-China;(c) the revolution in China and the menace that it brings for South-east asia with its great Chinese communities and for foreign interests inthe whole area;(d) the need of all these countries, in greater or lesser degree, for outsidefinancial assistance;(e) the population problem in Japan, which the war has done nothing tocure but, indeed, has tended to intensify, and any attempt to solvewhich must, at the best, mean strong and growing competition with united Kingdom exporters and may, at the worst, in the long run,bring some new Japanese explosion.On the brighter side we may note (/) the success of the International Emergency Food Council and theCommissioner-General&apos;s Office in securing fair allocation and duedelivery of the rice crop, thus making the most of available resources;
(g) the buoyancy of rice production in Siam and of tin and rubber productionin Malaya;(h) the easing of tension between India and Pakistan;(i) the demonstration by Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan that, given peace and good order, a settled administration and a reasonably stablecurrency, the great productive and trading aptitudes of the populationcome into play.  Siam points in the same direction;and from a more specifically British point of view v (j) the maintenance of our good name, political influence and economic interests thanks to the example set to the world by the British people in their efforts towards recovery;to our act of policy in India;to our policy of non-intervention and unperturbed watchful waiting inChina;to the zeali demeanour and resource of our representatives, whether ofthe foreign, Colonial, Commonwealth or armed services, and the growing spirit of collaboration among them, matching theendeavours of our people at home; and to the integrity, experience,enterprise and flexibility of reactions to new conditions shown by our business communities, the growth of a team spirit among them, and of confidence between them and the official side.8. This would suggest that we have a part to play in this area whichcan be played by no other Power, though we clearly cannot play it alone. It canbe best played by a combination of British experience and United States resources.9. Finally, I would express my sincere thanks to you Sir, for making myjourney possible; to my colleagues of the Foreign Service whose generous andthoughtful assistance multiplied the benefit and lightened the burden of the tour; and to His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioners at Karachi and Delhi, theCommissioner-General at Singapore, the Governors of Singapore and Hong kong and the High Commissioner of the Federation of Malaya and their staffs forall the courtesies and the very great kindness which I received at their hands..II. Notes on TourA. Alexandria: 12th January, 1949I stayed the night with the Consul-General. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Sir J. Troutbeck (British Middle East Office) and the two Commander s-in-Chief(General Sir J. Crocker and Air Marshal Sir W. Dickson) came from Cairo tosee me and spent the night also. We had talks before and after dinner.2.   The following are some of the points made : Palestine. (At this date, His Majesty&apos;s Government had not yet recognisedIsrael.)(a) Agreement between Israel, Trans Jordan and Egypt should be promoted;(6) The frontiers of Israel should satisfy the conditions-(i) of being not too unsatisfactory from the point of view of thedefence of the Canal Zone. The G.O.C. stressed the vitalimportance of the Canal Zone and of Egypt generally from thepoint of view of the defence of the whole Middle East;(ii) of being likely to gain the acquiescence, in the long run at anyrate, of the Arab States;(c) Israel should be drawn into the orbit of the Western Powers and denied to soviet influence; for this reason the moderate Israeli parties shouldbe supported. This is vital from the point of view of defence.(d) To this end, a joint United Kingdom-United States policy should be worked out. Diplomatic action should be taken both with Israel andthe Arab States.  The United States taking the lead in appropriate cases, in agreement with the United Kingdom.36746 B 2
3.   Middle East generally. Once the Palestine question is settled,(a) Defence arrangements should be worked out between the United Kingdomand the Arab States.(6) The United States should be associated with these, the object being (i) tobuild up a Middle Eastern front against the Soviet Union; (ii) tosafeguard Middle Eastern oil supplies.(c) Special attention should be given to the economic rehabilitation of theArab States, particularly Iraq and Persia.(d) A meeting should be held in London next summer attended by HisMajesty&apos;s Representatives in the Middle East, the Commanders-in-Chief and representatives of the London Departments concerned.A time could be chosen when some of our representatives would normally be on leave. This was thought preferable to a meeting in cairo or elsewhere in the Middle East.(e) Commanders-in-Chief should have greater liberty to discuss defence matters with His Majesty&apos;s Representatives. At present, while theymay talk to Sir J. Troutbeck, they may not open themselves fully toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo.(/) Special attention should be given to the relationship between the newUnited States co-coordinator of plans and (i) our own Commanders-in-Chief (ii) the Governments of Arab States.B. Karachi: 14th-16th January, 19494. The High Commissioner (Sir L. Grafftey-Smith) kindly made it possiblefor me to see the Governor-General, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Ministerof Pakistan, some of his foreign and Commonwealth colleagues, and membersof the British business community. At Karachi, as at other posts, I made a pointof seeing as many as possible of the members of the Foreign Service of all grades,privately or at their work, paying particular attention at Karachi (as at Delhiand Calcutta) to our new colleagues from the Indian Civil and Political Services.5. His Majesty&apos;s A mbassador at Kabul (Sir Giles Squire) came to Karachi tomeet me and I had long talks with him about the situation in Afghanistan, andin particular about the present Afghan-Pakistan difference about the North-west frontier Province. The Afghan Ambassador at Karachi (His Royal HighnessSardar Shah Wali Khan) joined us on one occasion and proved as persistent, if more reasonable and moderate, an advocate of the Afghan case as his colleaguein London.6. The Governor-General (His Excellency Khwaja Nazimuddin) was kindenough to ask me to lunch. It was a cordial and pleasant occasion at which littlebusiness was talked. His Excellency mentioned in passing Pakistani need for arms and other supplies and for assistance from the United Kingdom in gettingthem. He also alluded to the difficulty of recruiting staff for the Pakistan armed and civil services.7. At this lunch I met my opposite number in the Pakistan Foreign Office(Ikramullah). He was anxious to learn what were the functions of theParliamentary Under-Secretary in the Foreign Office and his relationship withthe Permanent Under-Secretary. The Prime Minister was about to appoint a deputy Foreign Minister and wanted to study precedent. I did my best toenlighten him and wrote out a few notes for him.8. The Foreign Minister (Sir Mohammed Zafrulla Khan) asked me totea at his house. We talked no business he had just concluded some arduousnegotiations with the Indian Government about property claims and was onthe point of starting on a visit to Lahore. Instead he treated me to a brillianttalk on the topography of Devon and Cornwall and on his adventures in theremoter parts of Sweden and Finland. On this tour he had had no rival as a talkerexcept General Mac Arthur.9. My talk with the Prime Minister (Liaqat Ali Khan) was another matter.I found him studying a telegram recently received from London about the changein the King&apos;s title as a result of developments in Ireland and about the consequentneed for legislative action in all Commonwealth countries. The point which wasexercising his mind was how to describe in persuasive form for Parliamentary
purposes the advantages for Pakistan of staying in the Commonwealth -when itwas clear that some of the more solid of these advantages would still be enjoyed by Ireland after she went out. We ranged over this question for some time andI suggested that he should discuss it with the United Kingdom High Commissionerwho was more competent to help him than I could be.10. He went on to put the Pakistani case about the frontier question withAfghanistan. The Afghan agitation was the agitation of a Kabul clique andnot of the Afghan people. The Afghans threatened that they could make trouble in the North-West Frontier Province but the, truth was that Pakistan could make more trouble for Afghanistan than Afghanistan for Pakistan. The peopleof the tribal areas had no desire to join Afghanistan. He was ready to testthis by plebiscite. Pakistan was spending on the North-West Frontier Province asmuch as the whole Afghan budget. As regards a change of name to Pathanistan,he could not agree to any name which would have a tribal connotation. If he did, there would be the same problem in the West Punjab and in the East Bengal.He added, incidentally, that Pakistan was garrisoning the frontier area with one brigade, while the British had needed fifty battalions in their day. In replyto this uncompromising view, I told the Prime Minister that this frontier question was one to which the Secretary of State had given his personal attention and thathe earnestly desired a settlement of it: it would be well worth Pakistani while,in the general interest, to get this controversy out of the way.11. Other topics touched on by Liaqat Ali were Pakistani need for supplies and equipment for irrigation developments; and his pet idea of an anti-Communist bloc from Turkey to Pakistan.12. On Indonesia he spoke at somewhat greater length and with what i thought was moderation and good sense. The Dutch would not gain but lose bytheir latest police action. Already they were in military difficulties. They wouldnot be able to maintain their position by force. What they should have done wasto model themselves as far as possible on British action in India. The Indonesians,who are not strong enough or experienced enough to march alone, would in thelong run then turn to the Dutch again for assistance, as Pakistan and India will do to the British. Old associations will count for much; they have had theirbeneficial side, as is now readily admitted. Instead of promoting in this way thedevelopment of collaboration between East and West on a new basis, the Dutchhave poisoned the whole situation in South-East Asia. I found this analysis ofgreat value in talking to the Dutch in Batavia and on other occasions.13. I had a good deal of talk from time to time with the High Commissioneron such matters as the supply of information on foreign affairs to Commonwealthposts; the future of ex-Indian Civil Service members of the Foreign Service, ofwhom there are quite a number in Pakistan; the relations between the Missions atKarachi and Delhi, which are excellent, though they do not see all matters inthe same light; the advantages and disadvantages of membership of theCommonwealth for Pakistan and India. Some of these were not, of course, myaffair, but I was glad to learn about them.C. New Delhi: 16th-20th January, 1949 .14. For reasons which will be plain from the introductory remarks, the visit to Delhi was one of the high spots of the tour, and an indispensablepreliminary to a visit to South-East Asia.15. The High Commissioner (General Sir Archibald Nye) believes that thereis probably greater scope for the development of British influence and the exerciseof British action in India at the present time than anywhere else. He thinks that good will between the British peoples and their Governments, following uponthe far-sighted and statesman-like action of His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1947,can be developed and turned to material advantage. We have an opportunity which ought not to be missed. But we must choose our men well (Sir A. Nyehas ideas about this which will be recorded elsewhere) and ^,ct with circumspection.We are tending a delicate plant. The responsibility has sobered Nehru, Pateland other members of the administration, who all feel the need for support and advice. But they are only likely to seek or accept such support or advice, especially the latter, if they have confidence in the sincerity and friendliness with which it
is tendered. On the Kashmir question, he.had waited for an approach fromNehru and then, but only then, had advised that there should be no militarysolution but that the Indian Government should make a gesture in the directionof a political solution. He thought his advice, reinforced by the steadiness andwisdom of the Indian Commander-in-Chief, General Bucher, had borne fruit.In order to exercise such influence at the right moment, particularly in the realmof foreign policy, it is essential that the High Commissioner should receive fulland timely information about events in the foreign field. In this respect, therehad latterly been a great improvement. Since Foreign Office telegrams nad begun to be repeated direct to him, on, e.g., Indonesia, he was fully in the picture andhad no complaints.16. General Nye thinks it likely that, under stress of responsibility, the minds of the Indian leaders will move slowly from some earlier anti-British, anti-Commonwealth and anti-Western positions and see that politically, ideologicallyand economically, the future of India lies in association with the West, inparticular with the United Kingdom, rather than as an independent country,mediating between Western ideas and communism and leading India against therest.  I will not develop here his reasons for this : they seemed to me to be cogent.17. The High Commissioner and I dined en famille with the Prime Minister(Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru) and his sister (Mrs. Pandit, Indian Ambassador at moscow) and her two daughters. The splendours of the former Commander-in-Chief&apos;s house, where he has now been bidden to live, seemed to irk him. Hewas unwell and rather silent at dinner, but afterwards he took me into a cornerand talked. He chose the topics himself.18. He spoke first of communism. The results of communism in Russiamust in the long run be evil because the means are evil. He said this in spite ofthe intellectual attraction which Marxism has for him. Marxism supplies acoherent explanation of the march of history and none has tried to do this sinceMarx. Perhaps it is now possible to compass such a synthesis. The vast develop-ment of scientific discovery has made the world almost incomprehensible to the single mind. Marx may be out of date now, but at least he tried and has had nosuccessors. He added, incidentally, that he though that communism, in whatevercountry it might appear, would in the long run be overlaid and transformed bythe national character, which must prevail in the end.19. About Malaya, he wondered why we were finding it so difficult to suppress the Communists and restore law and order. Was this not because theso-called bandits had support from the local population for economic reasons?Would it not be well, therefore, to supplement the measures of suppression withmeasures to improve the material welfare of the people at large ? As he. had given me an opening, I asked him, given that it had always been and still was our policy to work towards the autonomy and eventual independence of colonial territories, how he saw the future of Malaya. To this he had no ready answer.He admitted the difficulties of a plural community (in which incidentally hecomplained that Indians were less well treated than Chinese). He thought thata composite or multilateral state might be the eventual solution. But he did not seem to think the problem an urgent one. He did not mention Indonesia (though this was the eve of the Delhi Conference) except to say that Malaya and Indonesia(unlike Burma) were territories which had had close and sympathetic contact with india in the past and where Indian influence was strong. I repeated this partof the conversation in my various talks at Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.20. The Governor-General (C. Rajagopalachari) kindly invited me to tea atthe former Viceroy&apos;s house, which he now occupies. His Highness the Gaekwarof Baroda was present for a short time, but he took his leave and I was alone withHis Excellency (as he dislikes being called) for over an hour. .21. He started (I don&apos;t know why) by expatiating on the advantages ofmonarchy and of the disability of Presidents and elected or nominated persons likeMr. Truman or himself. The absence of monarchy leaves a lacuna in the lives ofthe people. The Indian people, in particular, need a symbol in their system ofgovernment. The princely families, had they not become degenerate and lifeless,might have furnished a constitutional monarch, but there was now small hope ofthis. Once the great figures of the liberation had passed away, there would bea gap which it would be difficult to fill. He was astonished that the regime hadsurvived as well as it had the bloodbath India had gone through.
22. He was much in favour of the establishment of provinces on a linguisticbasis. This would disrupt the unity of India. Nationalism was a disruptiveforce. Better a rather weaker state based on the toleration of variety. Suchapparent weakness was not necessarily such a disadvantage as the apparentstrength of the national state. The Europeans would have done better to preserve the Austro-Hungarian Empire.23. He thought that fear of the atomic bomb was the cause of the presenttension in the world and this would lead to war unless the tension could be eased.The best way to ease the tension would be not only to outlaw the use of the atomicbomb but to call a halt to all atomic research, peaceful as well as warlike, for aperiod. The worloT really didn&apos;t need, in a material sense, the fruits of atomicresearch in industry in the present phase. Better establish peace on a sure footingfirst. The Soviet &quot;regime might evolve in the direction of moderation andscrupulousness if tension, based on fear, could be removed. But time would berequired, and an act of faith.24. He thought that the British had given great gifts to India. They were :the rule of law, the heritage of a great literature, and the freedom of the individual and an instinct for liberal democracy.25. He said that the present United States way of life would lead to chaosand would have to be reformed when the time of scarcity arrived.26. I was much taken by the Governor-GeneraFs shrewdness, wisdom and simple friendliness. He walked with me round the great garden, in this seasonat its brilliant best, which, with certain adventitious mechanical aids in thematter of the movement of waters, imitates the famous gardens of Moghul days.At one point he stopped and asked: &quot; What am I to do about all this pomp?I employ 5,000 men on these estates.&quot;27. I spent a short while with Sir Girja Shanker Baivai (Secretary-General,Ministry of External and Commonwealth Relations), an old friend. We eschewedspeculations and got down to business. -28. He did not think that the present system of communicating information on foreign affairs from London to Delhi by telegram was adequate.. More shouldbe done through the High Commissioner and his staff in London. He wasarranging to have the High Commissioner^ staff reorganised and reinforced forthis purpose. He hoped that the Foreign Office would give the High Com-missioners&apos; office liberal day-to-day information, especially on European affairs,on which the Government of India had no other good source of information.Their missions in Europe were not yet competent to render adequate reports. on matters of current interest, where urgent action was being taken in the inter-national field, it would be useful if information could come through the HighCommissioner in Delhi also. He would always be at the disposal of Sir A. Nye,of whom he spoke in very warm terms. He also threw out the suggestion that members of the Foreign Office should come to Delhi from time to time.29. Like his colleague in Karachi, Sir Girja was anxious to know some-thing about the functions of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, as there was some question of appointing a Deputy Minister.I enlightened him to the best of my ability.30. As I was taking my leave, Sir Girja went out of his way to say that india was not seeking the leadership of Asia; but that events were forcing thisrole upon them.31. I called on Sir Girja&apos;s two. subordinates, the Foreign Secretary(K.P.S. Menon) and the Secretary for Commonwealth Relations (S. Dutt).Nothing of moment passed, but it may be worth recording that the latter had prepared a series of questions for me (which I did ray best to answer) on our system of posting and promotions in the Foreign Service, how we tackled theproblem of specialisation, how we organised the Commercial Diplomatic Service,and how the Foreign Office maintained liaison with the Commonwealth relations office.32. One of my most interesting talks was with H. V. R. Iyengar [Secretaryof the Ministry of Home Affairs), ex-Indian Civil Service and a former Privatebecretary to the Prime Minister. He spoke first about communism. There are about 100,000 party members in India, about 1,500 of them in prison.   There
are no Communist members of tbe legislature. Communism is not banned, exceptin Bengal. The Communist press is free. The Communists are hostile to theCongress Party. This is the usual situation. Communists support the nationalist party until it attains, power, and then try to undermine it. This is one reason why the French and Dutch are unwise in weakening the Nationalist Parties inSouth-East Asia.  This will play into the hands of the Communists.33. Suppression alone, he thinks, is no cure for communism. There are12,000 troops acting against the Communists in Hyderabad, but at the same timeremedial economic measures are being taken. Like Pandit Nehru, he wondered whether some such combination should not be tried in Malaya. The economic life of the people was of a very low standard and should be raised.34. On the French and Portuguese establishments in India he says thatNehru&apos;s policy was not to squeeze them out, but rather to press that the people should decide their future. The Government of India would have patience. Butthe French and Portuguese were behaving foolishly. However, there were moreimportant questions than these.35. India, he said, needed economic assistance: not a dole, but a loan and facilities to purchase. India was passing through a very difficult period. Onlymen of the personal prestige of Nehru and Patel and Rajagopalachari could have pulled her through.36. He thought it important not to underestimate the importance of theFar East, but he recognised the importance of Europe in the present state ofthe world. It was also important to realise that the Americans, for all their good will, could not supply everything that everybody wanted.37. He made a point of saying that relations between the United kingdom high Commission, under the present High Commissioner, and the Ministry of external Affairs, were very cordial. There had been a certain coolness at an earlier stage.38. The High Commissioner and I dined alone with the United states ambassador (Mr. Loy Henderson), with whom I was already well acquainted.Mr. Henderson is taking his duties very seriously and is showing a good dealof public activity, not always of the most adroit. He is much incensed by Indiancriticism of the American way of life and of United States policy, more so, Ishould have thought, than he need be. Though he has given his staff strictinstructions not to express or countenance anti-British sentiments, I think he is rather restive at finding that Indian criticism is so often directed against theUnited States rather than against the United Kingdom (the same is true of China).39. I also met Indian journalists, the new Indian Commander-in-Chief(General Cariappa) and his predecessor (General Bucher), and the Canadian,Australian and Chinese representatives.40. It remains to touch on the visit of Dr. Burton, Dr. Evatt&apos;s chieflieutenant, who came to represent Australia at the Delhi Conference on Indonesiawhich opened on the day of my departure. I had several talks with him and theHigh Commissioner. He is obviously a man of great ability and has the gift ofimagination; but we found that he had arrived with a distorted idea of UnitedKingdom policy on Indonesia and that he had seemed to attach greater weight to press reports and speculations than to official information from London. Heseemed to nave convinced himself that the United Kingdom Government hadknown in advance that the Dutch would take their second police action; that theUnited Kingdom Government had been consulted by Pandit Nehru before he had called the Conference; that the United Kingdom Government had assured theDutch on the quiet that no action would be taken against them and that the atlantic Pact would take first place; and that the arms which the Dutch were using in Indonesia had been bought with dollars supplied under the european recovery Programme. That, in fact, there was nothing to be done with the Dutch,except apply sanctions; that Dutch action was a breach of the Charter; and thats anctions should be applied whatever the consequences might be in other partsof the world.41, General Nye&apos;s handling of him could not have been better. He was firmbut friendly; and, basing himself on the ample documentation received from London,was able to bring Dr. Burton to see United Kingdom policy in a rather less
jaundiced light. I do not record all this for its own merits, but rather to show, byexample, how essential it is that our High Commissioners in commonwealth countries should have prompt, ample, first-hand information on foreign questions affecting the countries in which they serve. , .D. Calcutta: 20th January, 194942. We spent only a short night at Calcutta, but were able to see some of thestaff of the Deputy High Commission and of the business community. What we heard tended to confirm what we had been told at Delhi, namely, that a new and better relationship was tending to grow up between British and Indians, and thatprospects for British commerce were promising: we were getting contracts now that we should probably not have got before, in the days of political tension.JL-Rangoon: 21st-23rd January, 194943. Burma presents a much less encouraging picture than India and thiswas reflected in all that we heard there. I saw several of the Burmese Ministers,as well as the President. The interview with the last named was purely social and we talked no business.44. The Prime Minister (Thakin Nu) gave the Ambassador (Mr. Bowker)and myself tea one afternoon in the garden of his house, which, like all Burmeseofficial residences and public offices, was enclosed in a compound protected bybarbed wire and closely guarded. Mr. Bowker took occasion to conduct someofficial business with the Prime Minister and from the latter&apos;s demeanour I was able to judge why it is said that, while a man of integrity, simplicity, even ofsaintliness, he is also suspicious, credulous, stubborn and slow.45. We found Thakin Nu still intent on leaving the Government at an earlydate. He thinks he can organise support for the Government among partymembers and among the people at large from outside better than from inside. i expressed the Secretary of State&apos;s misgivings at this prospect.46. On more general topics, Thakin Nu recalled that he had recently stated in public that he would rather be free than ruled by others; but if he had to be ruledby others he preferred the British. The British had introduced the rule of lawinto Burma, and the idea of personal freedom. In fact, better the devil you knowthan the devil you don&apos;t.   I found this sentiment expressed in India also.47. He put in a pressing plea for financial aid from the United Kingdom,but did not deny that, for all that, the Government were taking an anti-capitalistline, including His Majesty&apos;s Government, in their strictures, and that there wasa good deal of anti-British propaganda in the country. He asked about Chinesecommunism and I gave the view current in London, as expressed in Intels, and confirmed to me by the Chinese Ambassador to India with whom I had a talk inDelhi.   He himself was cautious and non-committal.48. I did not see the Foreign Minister on this occasion, but he came to the marine Airport to see me for a while on my return journey. Of the other ministers, I saw most of U Ohn, Minister of Commerce, and Ambassador-Designate to London. He said, among other things that he was contemplating anappeal to the Burmese people for austerity in the use of rice, to avoid waste and reduce consumption, and so increase the amount available for export. An ethicaland humanitarian appeal of this kind should be effective with the Burmese people.He also said that he was in favour of developing Burma&apos;s other natural resources to the maximum, but for the good of mankind and not for Burmese domesticadvantage.49. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has excellent contacts with BurmeseMinisters and officials and they come gladly to his house. During my visit theformidable U Ba Swe, Secretary-General of the anti-Fascist People&apos;s FreedomLeague and of the Socialist Party, came to the Embassy for the first time.50. The senior Burmese officials whom I saw were generally in despondentmood. Some of them were inclined to blame us for having handed Burma over toan inexperienced Government which would not face facts or listen to skilled advice,but preferred to rely on outsiders of doubtful integrity. They had got rid of theirexperienced British and Indian officials, and had not enough good officials to carry36746 ^ c
are no Communist members of the legislature. Communism is not banned, exceptin Bengal. The Communist press is free. The Communists are hostile to theCongress Party. This is the usual situation. Communists support the nationalist party until it attains, power, and then try to undermine it. This is one reason why the French and Dutch are unwise in weakening the Nationalist Parties inSouth-East Asia.  This will play into the hands of the Communists.33. Suppression alone, he thinks, is no cure for communism. There are12,000 troops acting against the Communists in Hyderabad, but at the same timeremedial economic measures are being taken. Like Pandit Nehru, he wondered whether some such combination should not be tried in Malaya. The economic life of the people was of a very low standard and should be raised.34. On the French and Portuguese establishments in India he says thatNehru&apos;s policy was not to squeeze them out, but rather to press that the people should decide their future. The Government of India would have patience. Butthe French and Portuguese were behaving foolishly. However, there were moreimportant questions than these.35. India, he said, needed economic assistance: not a dole, but a loan and facilities to purchase. India was passing through a very difficult period. Onlymen of the personal prestige of Nehru and Patel and Rajagcpalachari could have pulled her through.36. He thought it important not to underestimate the importance of theFar East, but he recognised the importance of Europe in the present state ofthe world. It was also important to realise that the Americans, for all their good will, could not supply everything that everybody wanted.37. He made a point of saying that relations between the United kingdom high Commission, under the present High Commissioner, and the Ministry of external Affairs, were very cordial. There had been a certain coolness at an earlier stage.38. The High Commissioner and I dined alone with the United states ambassador (Mr. Loy Henderson), with whom I was already well acquainted.Mr. Henderson is taking his duties very seriously and is showing a good dealof public activity, not always of the most adroit. He is much incensed by Indiancriticism of the American way of life and of United States policy, more so, Ishould have thought, than he need be. Though he has given his staff strictinstructions not to express or countenance anti-British sentiments, I think he is rather restive at finding that Indian criticism is so often directed against theUnited States rather than against the United Kingdom (the same is true of China).39. I also met Indian journalists, the new Indian Commander-in-Chief(General Cariappa) and his predecessor (General Bucher), and the Canadian,Australian and Chinese representatives.40. It remains to touch on the visit of Dr. Burton, Dr. Evatt&apos;s chieflieutenant; who came to represent Australia at the Delhi Conference on Indonesiawhich opened on the day of my departure. I had several talks with him and theHigh Commissioner. He is obviously a man of great ability and has the gift ofimagination; but we found that he had arrived with a distorted idea of UnitedKingdom policy on Indonesia and that he had seemed to attach greater weight to press reports and speculations than to official information from London. Heseemed to have convinced himself that the United Kingdom Government hadknown in advance that the Dutch would take their second police action; that theUnited Kingdom Government had been consulted by Pandit Nehru before he had called the Conference; that the United Kingdom Government had assured theDutch on the quiet that no action would be taken against them and that the atlantic Pact would take first place; and that the arms which the Dutch were using in Indonesia had been bought with dollars supplied under the european recovery Programme. That, in fact, there was nothing to be done with the Dutch,except apply sanctions; that Dutch action was a breach of the Charter; and thats anctions should be applied whatever the consequences might be in other partsof the world.41, General Nye&apos;s handling of him could not have been better. He was firmbut friendly; and, basing himself on the ample documentation received from London,was able to bring Dr. Burton to see United Kingdom policy in a rather less
jaundiced light. I do not record all this for its own merits, but rather to show, byexample, how essential it is that our High Commissioners in commonwealth countries should have prompt, ample, first-hand information on foreign questions affecting the countries in which they serve. , -D. Calcutta: 20th January, 194942. We spent only a short night at Calcutta, but were able to see some of thestaff of the Deputy High Commission and of the business community. What we heard tended to confirm what we had been told at Delhi, namely, that a new and better relationship was tending to grow up between British and Indians, and thatprospects for British commerce were promising: we were getting contracts now that we should probably not have got before, in the days of political tension.E. Rangoon: 21st-23rd January, 194943. Burma presents a much less encouraging picture than India and thiswas reflected in all that we heard there. I saw several of the Burmese Ministers,as well as the President. The interview with the last named was purely social and we talked no business.44. The Prime Minister (Thakin Nu) gave the Ambassador (Mr. Bowker)and myself tea one afternoon in the garden of his house, which, like all Burmeseofficial residences and public offices, was enclosed in a compound protected bybarbed wire and closely guarded. Mr. Bowker took occasion to conduct someofficial business with the Prime Minister and from the latter&apos;s demeanour I was able to judge why it is said that, while a man of integrity, simplicity, even ofsaintliness, he is also suspicious, credulous, stubborn and slow.45. We found Thakin Nu still intent on leaving the Government at an earlydate. He thinks he can organise support for the Government among partymembers and among the people at large from outside better than from inside. i expressed the Secretary of State&apos;s misgivings at this prospect.46. On more general topics, Thakin Nu recalled that he had recently stated in public that he would rather be free than ruled by others; but if he had to be ruledby others he preferred the British. The British had introduced the rule of lawinto Burma, and the idea of personal freedom. In fact, better the devil you knowthan the devil you don&apos;t.   I found this sentiment expressed in India also.47. He put in a pressing plea for financial aid from the United Kingdom,but did not deny that, for all that, the Government were taking an anti-capitalistline, including His Majesty&apos;s Government, in their strictures, and that there wasa good deal of anti-British propaganda in the country. He asked about Chinesecommunism and I gave the view current in London, as expressed in Intels, and confirmed to me by the Chinese Ambassador to India with whom I had a talk inDelhi.   He himself was cautious and non-committal.48. I did not see the Foreign Minister on this occasion, but he came to the marine Airport to see me for a while on my return journey. Of the other ministers, I saw most of U Ohn, Minister of Commerce, and Ambassador-Designate to London. He said, among other things that he was contemplating anappeal to the Burmese people for austerity in the use of rice, to avoid waste and reduce consumption, and so increase the amount available for export. An ethicaland humanitarian appeal of this kind should be effective with the Burmese people.He also said that he was in favour of developing Burma&apos;s other natural resources to the maximum, but for the good of mankind and not for Burmese domesticadvantage.49. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has excellent contacts with BurmeseMinisters and officials and they come gladly to his house. During my visit theformidable U Ba Swe, Secretary-General of the anti-Fascist People&apos;s FreedomLeague and of the Socialist Party, came to the Embassy for the first time.50. The senior Burmese officials whom I saw were generally in despondentmood. Some of them were inclined to blame us for having handed Burma over toan inexperienced Government which would not face facts or listen to skilled advice,but preferred to rely on outsiders of doubtful integrity. They had got rid of theirexperienced British and Indian officials, and had not enough good officials to carry36746 c
on with, and many of these were quitting in despair. Some of them said that ifAung San had lived, Burma might still be in the Commonwealth.51. According to one of the British advisers still employed by the BurmeseGovernment the most encouraging and stabilising element in the present precarioussituation is the administration of law, based on English principles and stillapplied with integrity by the judges. Another of them, a man of great experience,said that ho wise man could prophesy about the future of Burma. The realobstacle to progress was that the people did not really need to work hard. Therewas no lack of food; they need never be cold, and clothing was simple; and bambooand thatch for shelter were there to be picked up.52. The British commercial community were naturally despondent, but inquite good heart, determined to go on hoping for a turn to better days. One ofthem thought that the local Chinese, in league with their compatriots in China,were laying plans to take advantage of Burma&apos;s present weakness, and that, as thiswould not be in India&apos;s interest, Nehru should intervene and try to have orderrestored.53 Mr. Potter, the Financial Adviser.to our Missions in Karachi, Delhi andRangoon, was good enough to give me a comprehensive review of the situationwhich, though it will be familiar to Departments, I will record here.54. He said the plain fact was that the country was in ruins. It had beentwice fought over and once occupied. The year after the end of hostilities hadbeen disastrous. By collaborating with Aung San, instead of driving him intorebellion, we could have set the administration on the right road. Political partiesnow had well-armed private armies, with British weapons acquired during the resistance or since. There were three left-wing armies, and lots of things inaddition. The rice mills just across the river from Rangoon were still being held to ransom.   All this, in addition to the trouble with the Karens.55. Burma, unlike India and Pakistan, had unwisely dismissed all british officials. This was a mark of inexperience and conceit. The Burmese Govern-ment did not trust its own skilled officials, who were now leaving government service The administration was pitifully understaffed. The Finance ministry was on the verge of a breakdown. The banks were in rather better shape. Evenif law and order could be restored, the country could not be run with its presentstaff. In spite of this, the Government were launching into new State enterprises river shipping, timber, oil. They needed  13 million to balance the budget, 9 million from the Oil Company and several millions more to move the rice crop.56. If financial help was to be given, it was essential to provide safeguards,such as the appointment of foreign advisers, especially in finance and banking.There should also be compensation arrangements. The United Kingdom couldnot conduct this kind of operation alone, if only for political reasons. the burmese were turning to us, but still regarded us as predatory capitalists whohad exploited Burma in the past and now owed Burma something in return.They would not easily agree to safeguards or compensation. On the other hand,it was essential that Burmese Ministers should face the facts and take stepsto develop the vast potential wealth of the country.57. In Mr. Potter&apos;s view, which is shared by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, the burmese problem should be tackled jointly by the United Kingdom, India and pakistan. Pandit Nehru could speak with authority to the Burmese Minister asostensibly a non-capitalist. It was in India&apos;s interest that he should take a hand,since India has a primordial interest in Burma as a supplier of food and a neighbouring State, and since the continuance of the present disorder could onlywork for the advantage of China or the Communists, the presence of neither ofwhom would be welcome to India. India had her own material interests too,though Nehru might be chary of supporting them too openly. Even if India couldnot contribute financially or find advisers, she could be a partner in and sponsorto any scheme which would combine assistance with safeguards. It was essentialto break fresh ground in this way.F. Singapore: 24th-28th and 31st January, 194958. After the charm, colour, shabbiness and fecklessness of Rangoon,Singapore makes a striking impression.  Itself a monument to British enterprise.
this great seaport, thanks to an efficient British administration and to the purpose-ful activity of its teeming population, largely Chinese, has made a remarkablerecovery since the occupation. With Hong Kong, and to a lesser degree, Bangkok,Singapore is a demonstration of the vast economic possibilities that would openout to South-East Asia if only peace and good order could be restored. Even in malaya, in spite of the disturbances, production of tin and rubber has been maintained.59. I was fortunate to arrive at Singapore before the dispersal of theColonial Governor&apos;s Conference and was able to meet in addition to theCommissioner-General (Mr. Malcolm MacDonald) and the Governor of singapore the Governors of Hong Kong, Sarawak and North Borneo and theHigh Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya.60. I stayed successively with the Commissioner-General, with the ForeignAffairs Adviser (Mr. Scrivener), with the High Commissioner for the Federationof Malaya (Sir Henry Gurney), at Kuala Lumpur, and with the Governor of singapore (Sir Franklin Gimson).61. A good part of our conversations related to purely Colonial problems and to the structure and functions of the Commissioner-general&apos;s Office, and neednot be recorded here. But the Colonial Governors have their foreign pre-occupations and I gather that the Foreign Service members of the Commissioner-General&apos;s staff have been of assistance to them.62. The Governor of Singapore and the High Commissioners at KualaLumpur administer territories at the meeting-place of three races, the Indian, theChinese and the Malay there has been age-long rivalry between Indian and chinese in this area and it is not likely to be allayed, but, indeed, rather to be intensified in the present and prospective state of the world. Developments in both India and China may make this an international question of growingimportance. Both territories have large Chinese populations, and the twoGovernors look on the communisatiori of China as a matter of intimate concern.One is conscious of India and of Pandit Nehru at Singapore and it is only when one gets round the corner to Bangkok that his shadow seems to grow less. feeling between Malays and Chinese is strong. The Malayan Federation also has itsdifficulties with Siam, though there are encouraging signs of growing collaboration between the two administrations in the suppression of Chinese Communistbanditry.63. Singapore, at the crossing of the sea-ways, is also an indispensable linkin communications with Australia. One feels oneself there within the sphere of Australian interest, and it seemed fitting to celebrate Australia Day in singapore.64. The focal point for the gathering together of all these strands-defence,foreign affairs, colonial administration, economics is the Commissioner-Generarsoffice in Singapore. Though some have spoken of it with less enthusiasm than others, opinion is, I think, unanimous as to its utility. With the present riceshortage, the work done by the Economic Section to follow up and see to the fulfilment of the I.E.F.C. allocations is still quite indispensable. In the field offoreign affairs it performs a most valuable co-ordinating function and enables the view of the Foreign Office to be expressed and promoted in places which itwould otherwise not so easily reach. The recent meeting of His Majesty&apos;representatives in foreign countries in South-East Asia under the presidency ofMr. MacDonald was most successful. It was hoped that the experiment wouldbe repeated and it is for consideration whether the net should not be spread nexttime to bring in India, Ceylon, Pakistan and Japan by inviting the attendance of the High Commissioners at Delhi, Karachi and Colombo and the Head of theUnited Kingdom Liaison Mission at Tokyo. Sir A. Gascoigne told me that hewould welcome this.65. One of the most interesting functions I attended was a dinner givenby Mr. MacDonald to which he had invited the Governor of Singapore, the Navaland Military Commanders-in-Chief, the Prime Ministers of five of the malay states (including Dato on n Bin Jaafar from Johore, President of the UnitedMalay Nationalist Organisation), some prominent Chinese and official andunofficial British from Singapore. After dinner, at Mr. MacDonald&apos;s request,I gave a short talk on the world situation, as seen from Europe, and an interesting36746 c 2
discussion followed. Even here, it was significant that the claws were out betweenMalays and Chinese.66. Mr. MacDonald was good enough to give me liberally of his time and we discussed many things together, but I will confine the record to a few points.67. He was emphatic that it would be very bad for our standing in South-East Asia if we failed to support or to press for the execution of the latest united nations Resolution on Indonesia. We had established a strong moral positionin this part of the world by our action in India, and it would be a tragedy if weforfeited it over Indonesia. Nationalism in Malaya was behind the Governmentin its action against Chinese Communist disorders. In this, Malaya differed from Indonesia and Indo-China, where the Dutch and the French were drawingthe Nationalists and Communists together. It would also, he thought, be a seriousblow to our prestige and influence if India entirely left the Commonwealth. in malaya, neither Chinese nor Indians nor Malays wanted to force the pace of progress towards self-government; but the tempo might be increased by recent developments elsewhere. As regards China, like almost everyone to whom I put the question, he thought that in the long run, though perhaps not in the short run,China would not succumb to communism of the Soviet type.68. I asked him about Australian policy, in South-East Asia and inparticular why the Australian Government were taking so passionate and extremea line about Indonesia. He said, first, that Australians were temperamentallyprone to the use of uncompromising language; secondly, that they believe strongly that the British way in India was the right way, and the more strongly so, in that australia knew what it was to have to make good her own freedom and had acertain fellow feeling; thirdly, that there was an element of compensation forthe &quot;White Australia Policy&quot; -here was a chance for Australia to showfriendship to an Asian people; fourthly, that the Australian Government weresincerely concerned at the prospect of disturbances in South-East Asia whichthe Dutch action would provoke; fifthly, they expect that a free Indonesia wouldbe a barrier to Chinese southward expansion.69. For all Australia^ interest in this region, however, he did not thinkAustralia was ready or fit to assume defence or other material responsibilitiesthere, and it would be best not to press her too hard to do so. On the other hand,Australia&apos;s participation in the Delhi Conference on Indonesia had been a goodthing. It had prevented the Conference from being a line-up of Asia againstthe West, and to that extent had been of advantage to the United Kingdom inSouth-East Asia.  I think there is great force in this observation.70. At Kuala Lumpur, Sir Henry Gurney was kind enough to explain tome the various measures he was taking to restore order in Malaya, and I also had a short talk with General Boucher, commanding the military forces, andwith the Chief of Police, Colonel Gray. Sir Henry made three points affectingforeign relations. In the first place, the spread of communism in China was making his task more difficult; the local Chinese, who had been brought to ameasure of collaboration with the Government and the Government Forces, were now cooling off. Secondly, it would be a serious matter if the Chinese deportees,who now by tacit agreement of the Chinese authorities were allowed to sail toAmoy or Swatow without travel documents, were refused entry into China bythe Communists. Thirdly, he referred to Siam and relations between the Malayanauthorities and the Embassy at Bangkok. There had been some friction, but from what Sir Henry said and from what I have since heard at Bangkok and elsewhere, the situation is now much improved. Joint Malayan-Siamese operations have been organised against Chinese Communist concentrations, and a good spiritof collaboration between the local authorities on both sides of the frontier nowprevails, and misunderstandings between our own authorities have been removed.71. At Singapore, I was informed of the importance of our retaining long-term influence over Malaya and, in particular, possession of Singapore itself. Wehave a role to play in South-East Asia, which no one else is competent to play,in order to promote collaboration between East and West. In so doing, we shouldbe serving our own advantage by helping to deny South-East Asia to communism,to safeguard valuable supplies of raw material, to safeguard communications with australia and New Zealand, and to give an impulse to economic recovery.
G^Batavia: 29thh-30th January, 194972. The first impression on seeing Batavia is to wonder why the Dutchhave not made more of it in the 300-odd years they have been there. It cannotbear comparison with Singapore or Hong Kong. I am told that the interiorof Java, which I did not see, is more creditable to Dutch enterprise.73. His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Consul-General (Sir F. Shepherd), had arranged inter-viewS for me with the High Representative of the Netherlands Crown (Dr. Beel)and, at the latter&apos;s suggestion, with Indonesian leaders, both Republican andFederalist. I also met sundry Dutch officials and businessmen, members of theBritish Commercial community, and some of Sir F. Shepherd&apos;s foreign colleagues.As a curtain raiser, Sir F. Shepherd&apos;s military adviser explained to me, with the aid of a map, the extremely difficult military situation in which the Dutch nowfind themselves.74. I talked to Dr. Beel in his office and was also his guest at lunch, when met some of his chief colleagues, civilian and military. Dr. Beel is not impressive.He is dry, rigid and unimaginative and not the man to put through a great political operation, with the need for which the Dutch are now faced. But he spoke with moderation. An agreement about Indonesia was necessary, but timeand patience would be required, and international interference would not help.He did not think that the United Nations Resolution, the text of which he had only just received, could be easily carried out, but he had so far had no instructions from The Hague and could not express himself definitely. He thought the three parties were slowly coming closer together. Certainly he and his Governmentwanted an early solution, and that solution was the earliest possible establishmentof the United States of Indonesia. But law and order must be established first.He had no objection to negotiating with the Republic as such, but this must beon the same basis as with the other constituent parts of Indonesia. He was not certain that the present Republican leaders could deliver the goods, and theywere not at all as moderate as Sjahrir.75. Sir F. Shepherd took occasion to press upon Dr. Beel the acceptanceof the United Nations Resolution and I told nim what I had heard about Indianviews on Indonesia, and drew the parallel of our action in India and its helpfulresults. Dr. Beel said he was impressed by these arguments, but thought thatthe Indian parallel was not an exact one. The Indians were much better ableto govern themselves than the Indonesians. And in India, no one had armsexcept the Goverment: in Indonesia, as in other parts of South-East Asia, theAllies had supplied arms to the resistance movements and the Japanese had leftdumps when they departed.76. The Republican leaders, headed by Dr. Sjahrir, came to the Consulate-General to meet me. I was struck by the moderation and lack of bitterness withwhich, on the whole, they spoke. The Indonesian question seems to have engen-dered more passion outside than inside Batavia. At first, Dr. Sjahrir left hiscolleagues to do the talking, but later he intervened. He opened with the disarmingobservation that whereas the British and Indians were both great peoples and could do things in a big way, this was not the case with the Dutch and Indonesians,who were both small peoples. Indeed, the Indonesians had picked up some ofthe faults of the Dutch. All agreed that a settlement must be reached in agreementwith the Dutch. But there was a crisis of confidence. Dutch acts did not matchDutch declarations. Dr. Beel was the author of two police actions, and the firstCatholic appointee for 300 years. Van Mook, for all his faults, had been better.The important thing was to make sure, beyond a peradventure, that the UnitedStates of Indonesia would soon actually be established. The question of theform of the Union could wait. If this main point was clearly established,immediate practical difficulties could be solved. When a Constituent Assemblywas called, Indonesians of all shades of opinions could easily come to a commonview on the Constitution. The Dutch must deal with the Republican leaders as representatives of the Republican Government and not as individuals; but itwas not practical politics to imagine that, in the interim period, the Republiccould be restored in its original glory. The Federalists could help if they would come out in favour of this line. Contact among all three parties was now beingpromoted.
77. The Federalist leaders were a more miscellaneous collection, from theastute and powerful Prime Minister of East Indonesia (Anak Agoeng GdeAgoeng) to the playboy Sultan of Pontianak from West Borneo. The talk was less satisfactory than that with the Republicans, since the Federalists had not reached agreement among themselves and were inclined to watch each other andstall. Like the others, they said that the objective was the setting up of theUnited States of Indonesia. They had no objection to dealing with the republicans as a Government, but the Republic must be treated on a par withthe other States and not given a preferential position. Also, there must be free elections in the Republican elsewhere : the Republicans had as yet nopopular mandate. They disliked the revolutionary approach and centralist ten-tendencies of the Republicans, but thought a Constituent Assembly could, without difficulty, agree upon a Constitution. They resented foreign interference inIndonesian affairs, and also the fact that they had not been permitted to express their views before the Security Council.78. As Sir F. Shepherd said, in a telegram sent off at the time, the impressiongiven by their talks was discouraging and disappointing. All parties seem towant, broadly speaking, the same thing: yet no one makes any positive move towards it. The Good Offices Committee (as it then was) had neither the capacitynor the prestige for this in fact its members made a very poor impression on me.And neither Soekarno nor Sjahrir is a Nehru, nor Beel a Mountbatten. Also,the Netherlands Government, unlike His Majesty&apos;s Government, are living in another age. The Netherlands diplomatic and consular representatives whom Ihave seen on this journey are, with one or two exceptions, a poor lot; and theyseem to love talking about the days of Queen Victoria.H. Bangkok: lst-Ath February, 194979. In Siam the teeming tropical life, vegetable and human, seems to reach a climax. Bangkok, too, has a charm of its own as the centre of a river civilisation.80. Here, from the point of view of British interests, there is a more cheer-ful tale to tell. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador (Sir G. Thompson) gave me an outlineon the day of my arrival. He believes that the general approach to the Siameseshould be one oi friendship and courtesy. Rough measures will not pay. Thepresent Government is well disposed and there have been no real troubles withSiam since the war. British firms are doing well. Contracts are coming our way.70 per cent, of the cars imported are British. British interests in the import-export trade, in tin and in teak, are on the Whole respected. Our information services obtain ample coverage for British news. Our action in India has enhancedour good name and has opened out the prospect of an extension of British influence in South-East Asia. (Sir G. Thompson was only one of several who made thisremark to me.) The country is at present prosperous, though this prosperity maynot be very firmly based. A record rice shipment is expected this month. It waspointed out to me, however, by a number of informants that there are darkeraspects of the situation. The Government is a usurping oligarchy, not popularlybased. The country is faction-ridden and both civilian and military elementsmight cause trouble. There is waste and corruption. And there is the Chinesequestion, growing Chinese nationalism directed against Siam among other places,acting through the local Chinese communities.81. The Ambassador does not think that the Siamese are to be counted uponto resist incursion or attack from Communist China. As is their wont, they willbow to the storm and trust to their diplomatic agility to secure their survival, asso often in the past. On the other hand, they could probably deal with an internaloutbreak, though they may need arms from abroad. There was little Communismamong the Siamese themselves. It was through the Chinese Community thatCommunism would come. All Sir G. Thompsons colleagues whom I consulted on this point share these views.82. I asked a number of people, including foreign representatives, what wasor would be the reaction of the spread of Communism in China on the Chinesecommunity in Siam. The general view was that the rich Chinese would haveprimary regard for their own interests and would sit on the fence as long as theycould. If the Siamese Government took a strongly anti-Communist line, theymight support the Government, but that support would be precarious because the
rich Chinese depended in the last resort on the coolies and other workers, and these would be under strong Communist influence. There are signs that the spread of communism in China will bring about a new wave of Chinese nationalism amongthe Chinese Communists in South-East Asia, and that the Chinese in Siam willtake this opportunity to get back at the Siamese in revenge for past slights andoppressions. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador suspects that the Siamese are conscious of this, and that it is this that has recently brought the Siamese Government to collaborate actively with the Malayan authorities against Chinese bandits on theSiamese-Malayan frontier.83. I was entertained to dinner by the Foreign Minister (His Serene High-ness Prince Pride Debyabongs), who was profuse in his asseverations of friendshipfor Great Britain. I also met, both in his office, and at dinner at the Embassy,the Prime Minister (Marshal Phibun Songgram), whose mild and disarmingmanner masks a ruthless ambition. At his suggestion, after dinner, we had along talk with Mr. Norman Young of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury (also on a tour ofthe Far East) and Mr. Doll, Financial Adviser to the Siamese Government aboutthe vexed question of the Siamese gold and compensation claims.84. In order to see something of the mainstay of life in South-East Asia,I went to see a rice-mill by the riverside. Here paddy was coming in by boat asit leaves the farms; sampled for quality; dehusked; cleared of the bran; polished;graded for quality, whether for export or home consumption; put up in 240 lb.sacks and carried by coolies down to the river again for despatch. In heat anddust and among perspiring humanity the machinery has been chugging awaysince it was shipped from Glasgow in 1895.I. Hong Kong: 4th-8th February, 194985. Hong Kong, like Singapore, gives an intense feeling of pride in Britishachievement. It has made a remarkable recovery in prosperity since the occupa-tion. Its entrepot trade is about three, times the value and about the same in volume as before the war, though statistics are difficult to evaluate since so muchof the trade with China passes through illicit channels. Trading, lawful or un-lawful, is in the Chinese bones. Hong Kong is an example to show what can bedone in the economic field in this region if law and order prevails, if there is ajust and efficient administration, a stable currency, and facilities for the expedi-tious and safe handling of goods. It has re-established and extended its tradingconnections throughout the Far Eastern area. A good many Shanghai firms arenow moving to Hong Kong. So long as there is no rival free port in the area and there is no prospect of this and so long as political troubles leave ituntouched, Hong KOng&apos;s commercial future seems secure.86. In Hong Kong, as in South-East Asia, the thought is all of China.Mr. Sebald, General MacArthur&apos;s Political Adviser, asked me in Tokyo whetheranyone in South-East Asia was thinking of Japan. I said that most people seemedto have put Japan firmly in the back of their minds as a problem that did not need to be bothered about for the time being : but it might be different in Australia.87. At the suggestion of the Governor (Sir Alexander Grantham) I madea tour of the New Territories on the mainland, accompanied &quot;by Mr. Heathcote-Smith (the Governors Foreign Service Adviser), the District Commissioner andthe. Commissioner of Police. We drove round the perimeter along the frontierwith China and visited the police posts from which a watch is kept for refugees and smugglers. We also looked at the so-called walled city of Kowloon, a verytumbledown place, the scene of the recent incident.88. The Governor kindly put us up at Government House (rebuilt by theTapanese and redecorated in exquisite taste by Lady Grantham). We naturally;alked about China. The chief danger to Hong Kong would be a united China,whether Koumintang or Communist. So long as China was in turmoil, there was10 immediate threat. There had as yet been no appreciable influx of Chinese intolong Kong as a result of recent troubles, apart from a number of rich men. SinceSTovember last the population of Hong Kong had increased by no more than 11,000,There had so far been in South China no large movement of armies or displace-nent of peasants from their homes. As to the future; he thought a generally helddew was that the Communists would, in the initial stages at any rate, act with
moderation. It was not certain that they would depart from this policy, but itwould be prudent to assume that they would. Most people who knew China were reluctant to believe that the Chinese people would be communised on the SovietRussian model. This did not mean that Mao Tse-Tung and his associates werenot Kremlin indoctrinated and directed.89. He drew a contrast between the Hong Kong Chinese and the StraitsChinese. The former had much closer links with China and were less con-sciously or loyally British subjects. As the Governor of Singapore had told me,many Straits-born Chinese as well as Malays had behaved with great courage andloyalty during the Japanese occupation. One of the chief officials of the Colonytold me that in Hong Kong the general Chinese view was that Hong Kong shouldbe returned to China, but not for about -forty years, that is to say, &apos;&apos; not in mytime.&quot; If Hong Kong became Chinese, many Hong Kong Chinese would make for the Straits to be under British rule again.90. The Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce entertained me to lunch andI had talks, then and on other occasions, with leading members of the british commercial Community. They were rather more optimistic about prospects inChina than their Shanghai colleagues proved to be. One of the more cautioussaid that there were two certainties : first, that Mao Tse-tung and company wereKremlin inspired; secondly, that the mass of the Chinese people were indi-vidualists. What would be the result of the impact? He felt in his bones thatin the long run the latter would prevail, and that even in the short run therewould be chances for foreign business. Generally, they thought that the decisivefactors would be the lack of competent officials; the ineradicable Chinese prone-ness to graft as soon as money passes through their hands; the invincible Chinesedetermination to carry on private trade, lawful or unlawful; the age-long Chinesespirit of compromise; China&apos;s need for foreign trade, foreign assistance, foreign capital, which Russia could not supply; the obstinate refusal of the Chinese tobe dominated by foreigners. They agreed that these were long-term considera-tions, but thought that the chances were good enough for us to stay in Chinaand trade so long as we could.91. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Canton (Mr. G. F. Tyrrell) andMr. Cobhill, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors representative at Canton, came to hong Kong to see me on Sir R. Stevenson&apos;s instructions. I need not record all our conversation. Mr. Tyrrell thought there was substance in the view of the BritishCommunity, but did not think there was much comfort to be drawn for Britishinterests. The Chinese, of whatever cast of thought, would always be nationalistand anti-foreign and there was little ground for optimism. On the other hand,there would in the long run be antagonism between Communism and Chinesenationalism. The Chinese nationalists might perhaps acquiesce in Russian domi-nation of Manchuria, but not of North China. For this reason it might wellbe Soviet policy to aim at getting a firm hold on Manchuria, at securing a Govern-ment in North China friendly to Soviet interests, and not to risk jeopardisingthese solid results by imprudent adventures in South China. Whatever theChinese Communists might want to do, he thought that Soviet policy would beto act with caution and by stages.92. I might record that I paid a call on the veteran Sir Robert Ho Tung(86 years of age by Western computation and 88 by Chinese), frail but still alert,alive to affairs and pleased to exhibit his possessions.93. The Japanese occupation has left little obvious trace in Hong Kong andSouth-East Asia. Even in the minds of those Europeans who suffered the rigoursand, indeed, horrors of internment, there is less bitterness than one might have expected. It is in the wider field of Asiatic consciousness that the Japanese have left their mark.J. Shanghai: dth^-llth February, 194994. Shanghai lives under menace and awaits its fate. The third mostpopulous city in the world (about 6 million) has been cut off from most of itshinterland. Much of the rice, raw cotton and oil fuel on which it subsists hasbeen paid for by E.C.A. If these American supplies are cut off the consequences would be disastrous. The Mayor (Mr. K. C. Wu) knows that he is fighting alosing battle, but professes determination to play his part with all the skill hepossesses.
95. I had a full programme at Shanghai. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador(Sir R. Stevenson) came from Nanking to see me, bringing with him his Canadian,Australian and Indian colleagues, with all of whom I had separate talks. Weall lunched together as guests of Admiral Madden in H.M.S. Belfast. I had talks with representatives of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, the British TobaccoCompany, Unilevers and other British concerns; with various specialist membersof the Consulate-General staff, with Mr. Cyril Rogers, Financial Adviser to theChinese Government, and with Bishop Houghton of the China Inland Mission.The British Chamber of Commerce entertained me to luncheon and I addressedthem. I called on the Mayor (Mr. K. C. Wu) and met him again at dinner, withother Chinese notabilities, at the home of Mr. John Keswick of Jardine, Matheson,the leader of the British Community. I made a tour of the port of Shanghai inthe Admirals launch and visited the British-owned dockyard (which is doinggood business), the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks (which is bankrupt), andthe wool textile mill of Messrs. Paton and Baldwin, a model factory which isexporting products as far afield as West Africa. Such concerns have difficultyin obtaining foreign currency for the import of raw materials and other neces-sary supplies; and none of them can remit their profits (if any) to London.96. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador outlined the present situation to me and his recommendations for future policy. These will be familiar to the Department.He could not foresee how a Communist regime would behave to foreign interests.The Kuomintang had behaved scandalously in this respect. For this reason theBritish community had not definitely made up their minds what to do in theevent of the transfer of Shanghai to the Communists. He thought they wouldstay and rely on their experience and skill to pull them through. Mr. Keswickexpressed similar sentiments to me and even spoke of the British Community asa kind of fifth column which might apply its skill, good name and contacts todevelop and encourage the ineradicable Chinese passion for trade, even if the communists came in. The Ambassador thought that the Kuomintang wasfinished and that its leaders would return to their home provinces to try for localsettlements. He did not believe that the Chinese would ever finally acquiesce in russian domination of Manchuria. The Russians had not. yet broken with theKuomintang and might perhaps be doubtful of their ability to make a favour-able deal with any new regime. It should not be assumed that the Soviet Govern-. ment wanted Mao Tse-tung to sweep the country.   They might prefer him toby several of those I talked with. One of the more thoughtful Chinese whom Imet thought that the Communists would try to make sure of the rice-producingarea round Shanghai before taking over the city itself. By so doing they couldensure good supplies for a few weeks and give themselves time to negotiate forfurther supplies from abroad. One of my informants thought that the Com-munists would be no better able than the Kubmintang to maintain a stablecurrency; that without such a currency there could be no proper Government; andthat whatever happened there was certain to be a period, perhaps a long period,of great suffering for the Chinese people, and serious loss for foreign firms.97. I only found three people who believed that the Chinese Communistswould succeed in establishing a regime of the Russian pattern in China. Theywere all Kuomintang officials the Chinese Ambassador in Delhi (Dr. Lo Chia-Luen), the Ambassador in Bangkok (Dr. Hsieh) and the Mayor of Shanghai.They said it was wishful thinking to believe otherwise, and had little confidence in the power of the Chinese people to resist the new and ruthless techniques ofthe Communists.98. I had an interesting analysis of the position from the Indian Ambas-ambassador (Sardar Pannikar) and this may be worth recording. This, he said, was theChinese revolution, the culmination of a long process. It was a Marxistrevolution and would follow a Marxist pattern, but not necessarily on Russianlines. There were three reasons for this. First, Russia had a land-lockedeconomy, while China looked to the sea and depended on foreign trade and hadintimate contacts with great Chinese communities overseas. Secondly, the Sovietrevolution had been based on the urban proletariat and the leaders had seized theState machine and imposed the regime from above; in China, on the other hand,the revolution was based on peasants&apos; councils, and would establish itself frombelow. Thirdly, there had been a State bureaucracy in Tsarist Russia, not a very good one, but it did govern the whole country, and the machine was at the disposalconcentrate on North china was expressed to me36746
of the revolutionaries: there was. no such machine in China to facilitate theassumption of power throughout the country. This special Chinese brand ofMarxism would have an appeal in Asia as a whole and would probably set the pattern for South-East Asia and perhaps even India. There was no trace ofliberalism in it. Except perhaps in India, liberalism had made no impact in Asia.For this reason, Indian Socialism might differ from Chinese and have affinitieswith the Labour Party, which was rooted on the liberal tradition of the tradeunions and nonconformity. The basic problem for Asia was food, not democracy.It was worth noting that Mao Tse-tung was better known and more often quoted in South-East Asia than Stalin. (He instanced a recent statement by Thakin Nu.)Mao Tse-tung had recently said that for the next 30-40 years, a bourgeois-socialistkind of revolution would be best suited to China.99. In view of the above, he thought that the United Kingdom policy of non-intervention and watchful waiting had been very wise. It was essential to avoidshowing hostility to the new regime. Our line should be that we would respecttheir interests if they would respect ours. Trade and passably good relations should be possible, and our people were right to stay.100. While I was in Shanghai I heard that the Northern Chinese had put outfeelers to Butterfield and Swire and to the British American Tobacco Company forsome resumption of trading and industrial operations, and that a barter deal (coal for flour) had been concluded between the Kailan Mining Administration andShanghai. The Peking branch of the Hong Kong Bank was open and doingbusiness, and in touch by telephone and telegraph with the office in Shanghai.These are possibly straws in the wind..101. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador told me that in reply to questions fromBritish firms, he said that there could be no objection to the resumption of trade,with the North, but that it was for the firms themselves to assess the risk and take their own decisions.   They were in the best position to judge.102. Mr. Keswick made two main points when I talked to him. The first Wasthe necessity for Anglo-American collaboration in the Far East and South-east asia, and the marriage of resources and brains. This was as essential as inEurope. The second was that the British community in Shanghai were tradersfirst and foremost, and proud Of it. They would stay in Shanghai as long as theycould and use every resource of skill and experience to maintain British interestsand prestige. They would maintain a united front for this purpose. If they wanted help, they would ask for it, and he thought they deserved it.103. Within a few weeks of his arrival and although new to China,His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General (Mr. R. W. Urquhart) has established himself asthe trusted leader of the British Community and of the Consular body in shanghai.  From all sides, I heard the warmest tributes paid to him.K. Tokyo: 12th-2lst February, 1949104.   The United Kingdom is represented in Japan: (I) On the Allied Council, now moribund, by Mr. Patrick Shaw (Australia),who speaks for the Commonwealth. Mr. Shaw was away in korea and I did not see him, but I had a long talk with his assistant;and Mrs. Shaw kindly gathered some people together to meet me. . Ihad some talk with the Russian member (General Derevyanko), andthe Chinese (General Shang).(2) In the occupation, by Lieut.-General Robertson (Australia), commandingBritish Commonwealth Forces, now exclusively Australian. With thereduction of this force to between 2,000 and 3,000 men, general robertson is over-graded for his job and has now little to do. Thissomewhat colours his outlook.  I saw something of him in Tokyo.(3) Directly vis-a-vis S.C.A.P. (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers),General Douglas MacArthur, by the United Kingdom Liaison Mission,headed by Sir Alvary Gascoigne, who is generally spoken of as theBritish Ambassador. Sir A. Gascoigne and his staff have establishedvery cordial relations with S.C.A.P. and his assistants. general macarthur and others spontaneously spoke to me in the warmest terms
of him. Sir A. Gascoigne has no official relations with the JapaneseGovernment. These are conducted exclusively by S.C.A.P. TheUnited Kingdom Mission do, however, meet Japanese unofficially,with S.C.A.P.&apos;s entire approval. Some members of the Governmentand others were invited by Sir A. Gascoigne to meet me, but 1 wasprevented by indisposition from seeing them.105. With Sir A. Gascoigne, his Service advisers and other members of his mission, I attended a &quot; briefing&quot; lecture at S.C.A.P. Headquarters, given inthe absence of General Willoughby (Head of the Intelligence Section of S.C.A.P.)by Lieut.-General Miller, a member of his staff.106. The lecturer explained the present dispositions of the Soviet and UnitedStates Armed Forces in the Far East. The Russians, with forces extending fromDairen through Manchuria to Kamchatka and the Kuriles, have great superiorityon land and in the air over the United States forces in South Korea, Japan andthe United States bases near to it. In addition, Russia has trained considerablearmed forces in North Korea. On the other hand, the Soviet forces depend for supplies and communications mainly on the Trans-Siberian railway, which isat many points vulnerable to air attack.107. Strategically the United States position is regarded as very unfavour-able, particularly in view of the Communist successes in China, which would, inthe event of war with Russia, make available to the Soviet Air Force valuableair bases in China. This could render untenable the United States position inSouth Korea, Japan, the Ryukus and the Philippines. The lecturer, however,added that there were no signs of any Soviet preparation for war in the far eastern area.108. The lecturer did not draw any conclusions of policy from this analysis,and indeed a similar review of the present military situation in Western europe would probably not be any more favourable. But the line taken by the lecturerlends point to General MacArthur&apos;s remark to me a few days earlier that it wasthe soldiers, &quot;my own flesh and blood,&quot; who had been putting ideas intoMr. RoyalFs head. *       &quot;109. I met General Mac A rthur twice: once at an intimate lunch at his house and once in his office. Sir A. Gascoigne has already fully reported on these conversations, but I will make a few notes. Like most great public men, general macarthur has a strong sense of the theatre, and he has it in supreme degree. Heis also an indefatigable and unsparing talker. But these idiosyncrasies shouldnot blind one to his really massive if somewhat unsubtle abilities. He is undoubtedly a great figure. He received me most cordially. I believe that hehas a sincere admiration for Great Britain, for the part we played in the warand the part we are playing now. Sir A. Gascoigne assures me that the general has treated United Kingdom interests in Japan with scrupulous fairness, ifnot indeed with some favour. United States business men, who have noAmbassador to represent them, sometimes complain that we are given the betterof the deal.110. The two chief questions which people are asking are: what are theJapanese going to be like after the occupation? and how are the Japanese goingto feed or otherwise dispose of their growing population (now increasing by1^ million a year) ?111. As to the first, General MacArthur seems convinced that the brand of democracy introduced under his auspices has come to stay; that the japanese have seen the error of their ways and understand being made to pay for theirmisdeeds; and that their policy will be to regain the respect of the world by-good behaviour. I found few in Tokyo who shared this optimism. Those whoknew most about Japan were the most cautious in expressing opinions. But someof them thought that something good from the occupation period might beretained and bear fruit in the future, though no doubt in a specifically Japaneseform. The least optimistic forecast was that the communisation of China would open the way for the resumption of the policy of the greater East AsiaCo-Prosperity sphere (which the Japanese had never in their hearts abandoned)under joint Japanese-Chinese Communist direction. This would be the only36746 E
basis on which Sino-Japanese collaboration would be possible and the japanese would think it worth while going Communist in the hope of achieving it. Thisforecast was held by some to be unlikely, since Communist regimes are not neces-sariiy like-minded, nor a Chinese Communist regime likely to be willing to be led by Japan.112. As regards the food problem, the Economic Adviser to the UnitedKingdom Mission observed that Japan will in years to come need to importincreasing quantities of rice. There is little margin for increased home production. Exports will have to be increased by five or six times the presentamount. This is bound to mean increased competition with United Kingdomexporters. The United States are unlikely to agree to any long-term fixing ofthe level of industry. They are already pressing for relaxation as regards ship-building and ocean shipping. At present, United Kingdom firms are doing goodbusiness. Their properties are being gradually returned and there is lessdiscrimination against them and other Allied firms in favour of the Japanese.Banking, insurance and shipping got away with a good start. Export and importbusiness came along later. Sir A. Gascoigne told me that he thought they wereadapting themselves well to the new situation and showing a spirit of enterprise and collaboration among themselves.113. The war has not solved the Japanese population problem, and no one can suggest any solution except increased industrial production and exports inorder to feed them. There are no substantial outlets for emigration. japanese are even less wanted abroad than Chinese. Yet the population pressure from both is bound to assert itself in the long run. This is one of the great questionmarks of Far Eastern politics. There can be little doubt that the Japanese will again do their utmost to establish predominant economic influence, to put it nohigher as a first step, over those areas which they seized in 1941 and 1942 as being necessary to their economic existence, and, which they were unable to hold againstAllied counter-attack. The facts of their economic situation have been burnedinto their consciousness.114. General MacArthur&apos;s view, from what he said to me, seems to bethat for the solution of the problem of raising the Japanese standard of living,which will soon become among the most pressing of our time, continued foreignassistance will be needed, and that less assistance would be needed to producedecisive results than in Europe. But at the same time he seemed to be opposed toany separate appropriation for rehabilitation, as distinct from supplies to preventdisease and unrest, and to think that the latter should be progressively reduced,in order to stimulate the Japanese to help themselves.115. General MacArthur spoke to me about the Far Eastern Commissionin Washington. Though he still professes to regard it, and not the United StatesGovernment, as the framer of the policies which he executes, he thinks that once it has settled the policies as regards reparations and level of industry, it should go out of commission. Policy should then be settled by Governments throughthe diplomatic channel. Until this was done, there would be no policy to speak of. The United States Government had not framed theirs and were inprovisingfrom day to day. It had never been intended that S.C.A.P. and the F.E.C. shouldcontinue so long or that a peace treaty should be so long delayed. Even now,he did not think it impossible to reach agreement with the Soviet Union.116. The absence of a policy in Washington was confirmed toSir A. Gascoigne by Mr. Max Bishop of the State Department, who accompaniedMr. Secretary Royal! on his recent visit.117. It looks, however, as though developments in China and increasing demands on United States resources, economic and military, throughout the worldmight now bring the United States Government to take stock and establishpriorities on a world-wide scale. Mr. Royall&apos;s alleged lucubrations in Tokyo (thegeneral sense, of which, namely possible United States withdrawal from japan in case of war, General MacArthur strongly repudiated to me) and the fact,which the General volunteered to me, that he would probably have soon to goto Washington to testify before Congressional Committees about the Far East,suggested some such review of policy may be in progress. General MacArthur,for his part, agrees that the Far East would be a secondary theatre in the
 event of war, but he maintains that it should be held.   To make no attemptBto do so would be an unnecessary strategic surrender and an immense gain tothe enemy.   It would, therefore, be a mistake to denude the Far East and3oncentrate all military measures on Europe., 118. If so, it is Sir A. Gascoigne&apos;s view that an attempt should be madeto co-ordinate British and American policies in Japan, the Far East and3outh-East Asia. In this he echoed the views of Mr. Keswick in Shanghai.As a first step, he suggests a visit by Mr. Malcolm MacDonald or one of the commanders-in-Chief at Singapore to General MacArthur. The General willlot discuss strategic matters with him or any of his advisers. He might openup a little more to a visitor from Singapore. Sir A. Gascoigne also suggests thathe or someone from Tokyo should attend the next conference of His Majesty&apos;representatives at Singapore. This would help us to see the Far East andSouth-East Asia as a whole (the presence of the High Commissioners at Delhi,Colombo and Karachi would also tend to the same result) and he thinks thisessential if we are to have a coherent policy suited to our interests and resourcesmd to the conditions that now prevail in those areas. With this suggestion, Ijlose the present record.W: STRANG.Over the Mediterranean,27th February, 1949.
