(49) SO7th March, 1949,     &apos;:: 7&apos;:-;&apos;; &apos;&apos;.CABINETGERMANY-BASIC LAW (PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTION)Memorandum by, the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsPresent Position and recommendations i circulate as Annex A to this memorandum an abridged* version of the basic Law (Provisional Constitution) which has been drawn up by the GermanParliamentary Council at Bonn. This Basic Law is not yet in final form, since it is still under discussion by the German Parliamentary Council, and does notyet include any of the amendments which were put to the Parliamentary council by the three Military Governors on 2nd March.2. These amendments, which have been agreed upon by the three military governors following their examination of the draft Basic Law, are attached at annex B. They have been shown to representatives of the German Parliamentary^Council, who will study them with a view to incorporating them into the basic law. The Military Governors have reached a clear understanding that the basic law cannot come into effect until it has been approved by their respective governments. Vis-a-vis the Germans, the Military Governors have made no-commitment about accepting the Basic Law nor about rejecting it if the Germansdo not embody the proposed amendments in their entirety. If my colleagues nowapprove the Basic Law and the amendments proposed by the Military Governors,and provided that these amendments are substantially accepted by the Germans,I hope that it will not be necessary to trouble my colleagues to examine the basic law a second time. If, on the other hand, the Germans produce a final draft which deviates considerably from these amendments, my colleagues will have afurther opportunity of examining the Basic Law.3. For the information of my colleagues, I circulate at Annex C a commen-tary on the general character of the Basic Law, which reaches the conclusionthat the Basic Law as a whole (even without the proposed amendments), satisfac-satisfactorily fulfils the purpose for which it was designed.4.   I now wish to recommend to my colleagues that: (i) They should approve the amendments agreed upon by the military governors.(ii) They should approve the Basic Law on the condition that these amend-ments are accepted by the Germans.Previous History5. On 8th June, 1948 (CM. (48) 37th Conclusions, Minute 1), the cabinet approved a Letter of Advice to the Military Governors on the (Provisional)German Constitution in the terms of Annex H to CP. (48) 143.6. The Germans were not at first informed of the detailed requirementscontained in the Letter of Advice since it was not the desire of the Occupying* Owing to the inordinate length of the Basic Law (149 Articles) only the most importantArticles have been reproduced at Annex A. i shall, however, be glad to give any of my colleagues the full version at their request.36664 copy No-31
Powers to convey the impression at the outset that a &quot;Diktat&quot; was beingimposed upon them as to the form of Constitution which they were to draft.The only requirement conveyed to them at that time was that they should draft a democratic Constitution establishing, for the participating States, a govern-mental structure of Federal type, protecting the rights of the participating States,providing adequate central authority, and containing guarantees of individualrights and freedom. By November 1948, it became clear that the draft Basi6 Lawwas diverging very widely from the requirements outlined in the Letter of advice. These requirements were accordingly conveyed to the Parliamentary-Council with two additional paragraphs, namely: &quot; (g) that each citizen has access to public office with appointment andpromotion being based solely on his fitness to discharge the responsi-bilities of the position and that Civil Service should De non-politicalin character;(h) that a public servant if elected to the Federal Legislature shall resignhis office with the agency where he is employed before he acceptselection.&quot; xThese principles were; however, worded in such a way as to permit the Germanssufficient freedom to draw up a Constitution of their own devising, taking intoaccount German traditions and methods. At the same time the intention wasmade abundantly clear that the Germans would not be allowed to rebuild a highly-centralised State which would again facilitate the rise to power of totalitarianforces. iv,/!,;,,r:-,,;- .., , : &apos;,; -mm ,       :, w^,-&apos;/ ;        v,:-1-;: -viii mail7. Since 1st September, 1948, the Parliamentary Council has been engagedin drawing up the Basic Law which is now nearing completion. At one time it seemed as if differences between the two major political parties, the social democrats and the right wing Christian Democrats, were so great that no agree-ment would be possible. After prolonged negotiations, however, a compromise,which was creditable to the parties and particulary to the Social Democrats,was reached between these two parties, and the Basic Law passed its third readingby the Main Committee. It has now only to be debated in a second and thirdPlenary Session before a final draft is achieved-8. The Military Governors decided that it would be preferable for themto examine the Basic Law before the Plenary Session took place so that any amend-ments which they wished to make could be freely discussed and negotiated withthe Germans, who would not at this stage have bound themselves by taking any decisions in a Plenary Session. In this way the appearance of Allied dictationwould be avoided.9. In examining the Basic Law the Military Governors were only entitled to concern themselves with ascertaining whether the Basic Law as a whole was consistent with the principles laid down in the Letter of Advice. At their meetings in Frankfurt on 1st and 2nd March, the Military Governors reached agreement on those points in the Basic Law which they coflaid6red!idevi^tedSfromthese principles and which therefore required amendments.10.   The most important of these amendments referred to(i) The legislative powers of the Federal Government.(ii) The financial powers of the Federal Government.(iii) The emergency powers of the Federal Government over Police.(iv) The reorganisation of the Land boundaries.(v) The position of Delegates from Greater Berlin. :(vi) The Civil Service.11. On (i), it was considered that the Federal Government was given theright to exclusive and priority legislation over too great a variety of subjects.The Germans were accordingly instructed to restrict the number of these subjects and to define in greater detail the legislative rights of the Lander.12. On (ii), the independence of the Lander was thought to be threatened by the excessive financial powers, legislative and administrative, retained by theFederal Government. An amendment to the Basic Law has therefore been proposed by the Military Governors to the effect that a greater number of exclusiveLand taxes should be drawn up and that the field of competence of the FederalFinance Administration should be restricted.
13. On (iii), the power of the Federal State to give instructions to police in the Lander in an emergency was considered unnecessary in a provisionalConstitution, since the Occupying Powers were responsible during the Occupationperiod for maintaining law and order. The provision is question would thereforebe suspended unless the Germans were at any time directed otherwise by the occupying Powers.14. On (iv), when the Germans were invited to draw up a Constitution theywere at the same time allowed&apos; to propose to the Occupying Powers, alterations in Land boundaries before the establishment of the Federal Government. In the basic Law the Germans made a provision for altering Land boundaries in theperiod following the establishment of the Federal Government. The military governors have therefore proposed that the right to alter Land boundaries shouldbe deferred until consideration of the Peace Treaty.15. On (v), it was decided that the Basic Law could not apply automaticallyto Greater Berlin, in view of the special conditions prevailing there, but thatthere would be no objection to the responsible authorities in Berlin designatinga small number of representatives to attend the meetings of the provisionalGerman Parliament.   In practice these will have the right to speak but not to16: On (vi), no provision had been made for a non-political Civil Service.This the Germans were instructed to make.17. These amendments have now been conveyed to representatives of theParliamentary Council, who received them with a good grace. After they havebeen discussed in that body, the Germans will inform the Military Governorswhether they are ready to accept the amendments. If they accept them the final draft of the Basic Law will be similar to the present draft, subject to the amend-ments at Annex; B., If, on the other hand, the Germans only accept certain ofthese amendments or attempt to modify them considerably, my colleagues willhave a further opportunity to study the Basic Law. .: 18. In conclusion I should like to make two points. The first is to emphasise that the provisions of the Basic Law are subject to those of the Occupation Statute,the drafting of which is not yet quite complete. This is well understood by theGermans and will be formally made clear to them at the time that the approvalof the Military: Governments to the Basic Law is given. This is, of course, a vitalconsideration since there are a number of matters in the Basic Law which havebeen quite properly included by the Germans, but which it would be difficult orinexpedient to allow them to operate without any control whatever during theperiod for which the Occupation Statute will be in force19. The second point which I should like to emphasise is that, provided the agreement which the three Military Governors reached in Frankfurt on1st and 2nd March can be maintained as regards the general principles apper-taining to the Basic Law, and provided that there is no tendency among any ofthe three Governments to insist on small and detailed amendments which couldonly lead to delays and possibly to the destruction of the compromise betweenthe two major parties which has made the present draft possible, the position which we have now reached seems to me satisfactory. For reasons connected withour broad policy in Germany and in Western Europe generally, it is most desirablethat, the remaining steps upon the draft Basic Law should be completed as soonas possible. If the three Military Governors can all be. put in a position to approveit shortly,! there is probably a good chance that it will be accepted by the peopleof Western Germany without too much difficulty.E.

- * annex&apos; bamendments to the basic law proposed by the&apos;. three military governorsText of Statement made on behalf of the Military Governors to theParliamentary Council &apos;My colleagues and i have asked you to come here to-day in order that we might comment to you upon several provisions of your proposed Basic Law asit was passed by the Main Committee of the Parliamentary Council. We have studied this document in the light of the aide-memoire which our Liaison Officersdelivered to you on 22nd November, 1948.. 2. There are a number of provisions in the Basic Law which deviate fromdetailed principles set forth in that aide-memoire. However, in viewing the document as a whole we are prepared to disregard some of these deviations, butat the same time feel it necessary again to call your urgent attention to other provisions, which, in our opinion, depart from those principles to an unfortunatedegree.3. In the first place, we would like to point out that,the powers of theFederal Government as now set forth in Article 36 are not defined with sufficientclarity adequately to safeguard the position of the States in a federal system.To correct this we suggest you delete present Articles 36 and 36a and substitutetherefore a new Article 36 based very largely upon your own language and whichmight read substantially as follows : Article 36(1) The Lander shall retain the right to legislate in the fields hereafterenumerated except where it is clearly impossible for a single Land to enactlegislation or where the legislation if enacted would be detrimental to therights or interests of other Lander. In such cases, and provided that theinterests of the several Likiuer are clearly, directly and integrally affected,the federation shall have the right to enact such; legislation as may benecessary or appropriate. (Here follow the items of Article 36 except thatCinema and Press are omitted from Item 3, and the words &quot; in its entirety &quot;are omitted from Item 7. Item 1 and Items 2, 3, and 4 of Article 36a areadded to the list of Items in this Article.4. In the second place, my colleagues and I would like you to understandthat we are ultimately responsible for security, and further that the powerscontained in Article 118c may not be exercised until specifically approved.bythe Occupation Authorities. This reservation upon the exercise of these policepowers will be repeated at the time when you are formally advised of our action with regard to the constitution as a whole.5. In the third place we have noted with concern the extent to which thefinance powers depart from the criteria agreed upon in London and transmitted to you in paragraph (d) of the aide-memoire. We have already had occasion to advise you that in our opinion substantially the same provisions would resultin &quot; the Lander being left without adequate independent sources of revenue forthe conduct of their affairs.&quot; We would suggest, therefore, several changes in articles 122a, 122b and 123 which, we believe, would enable those Articles morenearly to satisfy the principles of financial organisation which we believe tobe of primary importance in a federal system. Specifically we suggest thatthose Articles be reworded to read substantially as follows : &apos; Article 122aThe Federation shall have exclusive legislation in customs and financialmonopolies (federal taxes) and priority legislation, on the following taxes(concurrent taxes) :-(I) Excise taxes and taxes on transactions, with the exception of taxes(Land taxes) with localised application, in particular the taxes,on real estate acquisition, incremental value and on fire protection.36664 &apos; d 2
(2) The taxes on income, property, inheritance arid gifts (or donations).(3) Realsteuern (taxes on real estate and on business), Iwith the exceptionof the fixing of tax rates,Article 122b       &apos;The Federation shall exercise priority legislation in the field of concurrenttaxes only to the extent that it may require the whole or any portion of the proceeds of any concurrent tax or taxes to cover its responsibilities. If theFederation takes over a portion of a concurrent tax the remaining portionshall be retained by the Lander as and where collected.Article 123 vThe federal taxes shall be administered by Federal Finance authorities.The Federal Government may if it so desires administer in their entirety- through federal financial authorities those taxes which it imposes for federal;; purposes except that it shall administer the tax on income only to the extent that such a tax has been appropriated for federal purposes. The structure of the Federal Finance authorities and the Finance Courts and the procedure to be applied by them shall be regulated by Federal Lawl The heads of theFinance and Customs authorities in the Lander shall be appointed by agree-ment with the Governments of the Lander involved.(2) The land taxes and concurrent taxes other than those referred to in&apos;    Article 123 (1) shall be administered by Land Finance authorities.: (3) The raising of the Realsteuern shall be regulated by Landlegislation.&apos;To be consistent with what has been said above we wish to call your attention tothe need for deleting Article 138-C (4) and in substitution thereof, for a detailedspecification of land taxes.6- In the fourth place, we wish to draw your attention to the fact that article 129-1 (2) is not entirely clear as to the extent to which the independence of the judiciary is insured: We urge you give it your thoughtful attentionparticularly as to the safeguards provided in connection with the dismissal of judges.: 7. In the fifth place, we consider that the possibilities for the Federation toestablish its own administrative agencies (Articles 112-2 and 116) are wide. Wewould therefore like to to point out that the Military Governors will have to givecareful consideration at the time when such agencies are established to ensure thatthey do not represent too great a centralisation of power.8. In the fifth place we should like to clarify our position with regard tothe question of the Federal Civil Service. If principles with&apos;regard to the civilservice as set out in Articles 27 (6) and 62 are to be embodied in the constitutionthey must be modified to conform to the principles enumerated in paragraphs (g)and (h) in our aide-memoire of 22nd November, 1948.9. A sixth matter which has concerned us is the question of the reorganisation of the territories of the Larider as set out in Articles 25 and 26. In this connec-tion we wish to draw your attention to the statements which we made to theMinisters President on 20th July, the pertinent portions of which were asfollows :   ;&apos; We wish you to appreciate that the question of land boundaries is oneof great importance to us. We feel that the present is an appropriate timeto deal with it, and we are ready to do so. However, it would be much moredifficult for us to deal with it later on, it has, for example, reactions withregard to our own zonal boundaries. We do not feel that we should be willing to deal with the subject again at a later date prior to the conclusionof a Peace Treaty. Moreover, the fixing of land boundaries is important in!&apos;!&apos;: relation to the constitution itself. We believe that we should recommend toour Governments that the boundaries which we.recogriised during the drafting of this constitution should remain unchanged, at least until a Peace treaty is signed.&apos;Our position to-day is the same as it was at that time, and we feel we must nowadvise you that unless we unanimously agree to change this position it must remainsO until the Peace Treaty. . In this case also- w%wCBj^i^iiwi -yptt of this decision at the time formal action is taken with regard to the constitution as a whole.
i 1 &apos; 10.-Finally, my colleagues andfl wouldvlike you to know that.wc understand the solicitude which the Parliamentary Council has shown for Berlin.:) However,in view of the existing situation, that portion of Article 22 which refers to Berlinmust be suspended, nevertheless, there will be no objection to the responsibleauthorities in Berlin designating a small number of representatives to attend the meetings of the Parliament.   :   1 -- -ANNEX 6- &apos;  &apos; -&apos;COMMENTARY ON THE BASIC LAW (PROVISIONAL&apos; CONSTITUTION) -The Basic Law as adopted by the Main Committee of the ParliamentaryCouncil after three readings is a comprehensive document divided, into thirteensections. As a blue-print for a governmental organisation it appears, to fufil thepurpose for which it is designed. It draws its inspiration from previous. GermanConstitutions and aims at avoiding difficulties which previous: German goyern-mental organisations have had to face. This is all the more desirable as it; willhave to be operated by Germans who will understand best their own traditionsand habits of thought.2. There is no doubt that the men who met at Bonn for the past five monthswere,above the average of the German politician in intelligence, integrity andfirmness of purpose. They worked very hard and for the most part ihliarmony.They learned to know each other&apos;s point of view and, in time, to respect their differences. At the last they showed a spirit of mutual tolerance which permittedcompromise to be reached on matters on which previous divergencies were wide.The result has been a workable instrument in many ways superior to the Consti-tuition elaborated at Weimar in 1919. .3: Before examining the Basic Law in the light of the task before;&apos;theParliamentary Council and the principles laid down in the aide-memoire, it wouldbe well to recall how these principles were found. At first the three occupying powers sought to establish a fairly detailed list of requirements which theGerman Constitution would have to fulfil. Representatives of each Power looked to their own experiences of Federations and tried to lay down criteria based upon this experience and upon their Western European conception of democraticFederal Government. Agreement on this basis proved impossible. It was there-fore decided that a general formula should be found and supplemented by what-ever detailed requirements the Occupying Powers could all accept. On all other points it was agreed that the proposals of the Germans would be accepted provided they fell within the general outline of the task given to them. It was realised in London, when the principles were laid down, that insistence on every one ofthem, as interpreted by each Occupying Power, would be undesirable. For thisreason it was provided that the future Constitution should be examined as awhole to see if, in a substantial measure, the requirements of the occupying powers had been met. This was all the more necessary as the principles were laid down without consideration of the German tradition or habits of thought.The task before the Military Governors therefore is not only to examine in whatrespects the Basic Law deviates from the principles of the Letter of Advice, butalso to decide whether these deviations are in themselves so important, giventhe balance of the document as a whole, as to cause them to disapprove the basic law or require such amendments as would be equivalent in their effect todisapproval. ; &apos; . . -4. For the sake of ease in analysis each bf the major principles and specificrequirements of the aide-memoire of 22nd November, 1948, will be examined in turn. Only thus cap an examination of the blue-print be focused on those detailswhich the Six Governments had considered important. It must be borne in mind,however, that this dissection risks presenting the question in isolation and over-looking the inierplay of compensating forces.Democratic Constitution - ,    i . ,;i5. The first federal principle was that the constitution must be democratic.Article 21 lays down the principle that State authority emanates from the people
and shall be exercised indirectly.by freely elected representatives of the people.It also lays down that the Government shall be responsible to the people. Further,Article 27 imposes the same requirement of responsible government controlled byrepresentative assemblies on the lower levels of administration..6. The application of these principles reveals, however, a curious distrustof the people and the political parties which is the natural product of recentGerman experience. The main legislative body, the Volkstag, is directly elected,but all other organisms participating in legislation or administration areindirectly elected. The members of the Bundesrat are appointed by the land governments^ who are responsible to the Landtage the members of which are directly elected. The Federal President is elected by a college composed ofdirectly elected representatives. The Federal Chancellor is chosen by the membersof the Volkstag, but he chooses freely his own Ministerial colleagues. Dailysupervision of the Government is entrusted to the Bundesrat. . Initiative andreferendum, which figured prominently in the Weimar Constitution, have been deliberately excluded. Political parties are free to organise in conformity with political principles but may be declared unconstitutional and banned if their arms or the behaviour of their members jeopardise the fundamental democraticorder or the existence of the Federation (Article 21a).7. This distrust of the people may be well founded in German experience and justified by recent events in Soviet satellite &quot; democracies.&quot; To British eyes,however, the safeguards present, among others, the danger that the government might fall into the hands of an oligarchy of leading civil servants and thatpopular control might be so remote as to become ineffective. The requirement ofan absolute majority vote of the Volkstag for the appointment and dismissal ofthe Federal Chancellor and the lack of direct control by the Volkstag over theother Ministers, together with the provision for legislating with only the bundesrat in a state of &quot; legislative emergency&quot; (Article 11 lz) recall toovividly the Bismarckian system where the Federal Chancellor and the StateSecretaries were not responsible to the Reichstag. The intention of theParliamentary Council, however, is not to avoid the popular control of theGovernment but rather to ensure a firm stable Government which will not be atthe mercy of the tenuous compromises of chance party alignments. The mainstructure of the Basic Law is democratic in character and ensures the eventualcontrol of the Government through the ballot box. It can therefore be concluded that the requirements of the first general principle laid down in the Londondecisions have been met;Constitution of Federal Type8. The second major principle is that the constitution must establish forthe participating Lander a governmental structure of federal type. To determine whether the Basic Law fulfils this requirement, it is proposed to examine iton those points which, according to a well-known English authority on public administration, differentiate between a Federation and a unitary State.(a) Distribution of Legislative Powers-In a Federation the legislative powers should be distributed so as to give to the Federation and theLander clearly defined spheres of legislative competence. Article 35enumerated the subject matters on which the Federation shall haveexclusive legislative competence. Article 36 enumerates those matterson which the Federation shall have priority in legislation only inorder to regulate &quot; what must be uniformly regulated.&quot; The Landercan legislate on these matters in so far as the Federation does not doso. In case of doubt on the validity of competing legislation, federal law supersedes Land law (Article 31). There is also another provision that on a few matters the Federation may issue general provisions(Article 36a). All matters not mentioned in these Articles are leftto the exclusive competence of the Lander.    ,(&amp;) Distribution of administrative powers. In a Federation, both the centralagency and the component parts must have their own sphere of admin-istrative competence. The Basic Law provides that the federation and the Lander shall each have their own Governments andadministrations. It also lays down the sphere of exclusive Federaladministration (Articles 116, 116a, 117, 118, 118a).   Otherwise the
Land administration executes Federal laws as well as its own Landlaws (Article 112/1) but&apos;under regulations clearlylaid down, ih the basic Law.so as to prevent the Federation from extending its control to purely Land affairs (Articles 112/2,113). Alto.6ugh a true Federa-:r.,.. . tion would, in theory, require completelyi .. the system, of the Basic Law dates back to the days of the Germani       .-, Empire and is well understood in Germany as a necessary safeguards of the interests of the Lander. v. &apos; - .i - (c) Representation, of the States in the Federal Parliament.-^A. truly federalsystem should provide, for adequate consideration, of; the interests ofthe Lander in federal legislation. This is usually achieyeabya second chamber composed in such a manner as to ensure representation of. the Land interests. A popularly elected Senate, tends to diuplicatethe political composition of the Lower House and only the relativeweight given to the area of representation as opposed, to the numberof inhabitants therein differentiates it from the Lower House. -the basic Law provides for a Bumdesrat composed of representotiyes ofthe Land Governments acting under instructions and liable to recall(Article 66). The size of the Land only slightly modifies the numberof votes allotted to each Land. The Bundesrat has only a power of&apos; veto whichcan be overruled by the Lower House (Article 104).   As&apos; an exception, legislation on certain important matters, Such as taxaTtioh, organisation of federal administrations, &amp;c., requires the agree^ment of both Houses (Article 105). The Bundesrat also participatesin the conduct of federal affairs (Article 73). ;(d) Special Revenue Arrangements.-^ maintain their independence intheir own spheres, the Federation and the Lander require independentsources of revenue adequate to meet their Ordinary expenditures.While the Basic Law provides that by the end of 1955 the federation and the Lander shall each have their-Own sources of revenue, itmaintains for the time being a dependency of the Lander on the federaltaxes. It also gives the Federation the task of financial equalisationamong the Lander in such a manner as to give to the Federation a powerful instrument of pressure. The power of the Federation, is kept in check however by requirements for agreement of the Bundesratto these measures and to the allocation of common -taxes. It is ddubtfulwhether, in fact, the influence of the Federation over the finances ofthe Lander cannot be more effectively exercised through the control of credit than through the use of the right to allocate revenues.(e) Special Judicial Arrangements.-ln a Federation there should be provision &apos;for independent judicial decision on differences between the federation and the States as well as between the States themselves. The&apos;basic law provides for a Federal Constitutional Court with the necessary powers (Article 128-1).(/) Stipulation relating to the form of State Government-Geneval provisions should be made in a Federal Constitution to ensure that Lander are free to form their Governments provided they are hot incompatible with the principles on which other Land Governments or the federal government are formed. As already seen, Article 27 imposed on theLander the same requirement for responsible government with elected assemblies. Otherwise the Lander are free to devise their ownorganisation.(a) Specially difficult amending process.-^ ensure the maintenance of thegovernmental structure of a Federation constitutional amendments;.v must be more difficult to pass than ordinary laws.   The Basic Lawprovides as did the Weimar Constitution that constitutional amend-ment shall require the approval of two-thirds of the members of theVolkstag and two-thirds of the votes of the Bundesrat. Laws affectingthe organisation of the Federation into Lander and the Vote of theLander in legislation and administration require a majority of four-fifths of the votes in the Bundesrat (Article 106).9. From the foregoing analysis the, Basic Law seems on the whole to conformfully to the requirements of a Federal Constitution. It may be safely concluded,therefore, that the requirements of the second general principle laid down in theLondon decisions have been met.
Protection of Rights of Participating States10. The third major principle is that the Constitution must protect the rightsof the participating States. The powers of the Second Chamber have already beenoutlined. Further comment would be redundant. It can safety be concluded thatthe requirements of the third major principle laid down in the London decisions have been met.Provision of A dequate Central A uthority11. The fourth major principle is that the Constitution must provide for adequate central authority. The basic Law gives wide power of legislation tothe Federation. Most important matters in the financial, economic, social and legal fields fair within federal legislative competence. There is, therefore, nodoubt that the provisions of legislative power for the central authority are adequate.12. In the executive field, the position is not so clearly defined. TheFederation, has nO armed forces at its disposal. Its only physical means of compulsion lie in the possibility of using the Land police forces,&quot; in order to avertan imminent danger to the existence of the free and democratic basic order ofthe Federation or a Land &quot; (Article 118c). Its own direct agencies are strictly limited to the Foreign Service, the federal finance administration,, federal rail-ways, federal postal services and the administration of federal waterways and shipping (Article 116). Otherwise, the Federation is dependent on the Landadministrations (Article 112/1) subject to the right to issue general administrativeprovisions and to send inspectors. tp the Lander to supervise. the execution of federal laws. Disputes between the Federation and the Lander on these matters are to be decided by the Bundesrat (Article 112/2). The Federation may alsoregulate the uniform training of officials and employees; it participates in theappointment of the heads of the authorities at the middle level. The Landauthorities are subordinate to the directives of the competent highest federal authorities (Article 113). There are also important means of pressure through thefinancial administration to which allusion has already been made.13. These various provisions in practice will give considerable power tothe central authorities. The provisions of Article 113 are important and will no doubt give to the Federal Administration an influence over officials throughoutGermany. Participation in appointments of Landrate will carry that influencedown to local administration. In any other country it might be difficult to see. such a system working smoothly. It has, however, been the practice in Germanysince the days of the North German Confederation. It worked well then andunder Bismarck because there was no great difference between the German Landeron social policy; they were all police States. Difficulties only arise when thedifference in political aims between the centre and one or more of the Lander isunbridgeable. Such cases occurred in Thuringia in 1922 and Bavaria in 1923.It is conceivable that a serious conflict might develop in the future between anS.P.D. Federal Government and a C.S.U. Bavarian Government over such matters as socialisation. This kind of conflict, leading to the very brink of secessioncannot be avoided by mechanical means. The strong central executive authority in 1923 with a small army at its disposal was no more able to impose its will onBavaria than will the future Federation. Lack of direct means of. pressure might,on the other hand, induce a greater spirit of compromise and prevent the situationbeing carried to an impasse. In the light of German tradition, therefore, itcan be concluded that the provisions for executive powers for the central authority are adequate.14. The judicial field is not one where conflicts of power between the Landerand the Federation should operate. Nevertheless, there are matters in whichuniformity of legal decisions is essential. The Basic. Law set up Federal courts to deal with these matters and to preserve the unity of German law. It is safe to conclude, therefore, that the central authority will be adequate in the legisla-tive, executive and judicial fields, and that the requirements of the fourth majorprinciple laid down in the London decisions have been met.Guarantees of Individual Rights and Freedom15. The fifth and last major principle is that the Constitution must guaran-tee individual rights and freedom.   The Basic Law contains a section on Basic
s which has been carefully drafted to include the most modern conception^e rights of man.; When compared with the Universal Declaration of Humanis adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in the first half&quot;e third session in. Paris only the right to emigrate and the right to be pre-d innocent until found guilty;;(Article 11 of the Declaration) are not covered,he: other hand, the Basic Law safeguards the other rights based upon recentrience of democracies. It provides expressly that no one may be compelledPerform war service against his conscience (Article 5). It also provides thatlooter will be deprived of his right to be represented by a candidate of hispi choice by the creation of single lists of candidates (Einheitsliste)(Articlei 18).lalso provides that those who abuse their freedoms to undermine&apos;that Of othersid break down democratic&apos; institutions shall forfeit their rights. It can bemicluded, therefore, that the requirements of the fifth major principle laid downWthe London decisions have been met.16.   It only remains to examine whether in fulfilling their task the Parlia-ntary Council has done it in a manner which accords with the specific require-ents laid down in London and communicated, with two additions, in thede-memoire of 22nd November, 1948.   It should be recalled at the outset thate text of the aide-memoire stated that the Military Governors &quot;intend to con-der the provisions of the Basic Law (Provisional Constitution); in their whole-ntext.&quot;   Nevertheless, they believe that the Basic Law (Provisional Constitu-on) should to the maximum extent possible provide: and the requirementsHow.   The very use of the phrase &quot;the maximum extent possible,&quot; which is ine London Letter of Advice to the Military Governors implies that the require-ents which follow are not absolute but capable of interpretation and adjustmentnd the members of the Parliamentary Council can rightly claim that in drafting-e Basic Law they met &quot; to the maximum extent possible &quot; the detailed provisionsthe aide-memoire.etailed Requirements17.   (a) Bicameral legislative system. As emerges clearly from the fore-oing analysis the Basic Law meets the requirement for a bicameral legislativestem in which the Bundesrat represents the individual Lander and has sufficientower to safeguard the interests of the States.(b) Limitations of the powers of the executive. The powers of the Federalovernment are definitely prescribed in the Basic Law. The use of emergencyOwers is also clearly defined (Article 111). &quot;In order to avert an imminentanger to public safety and order,&apos;&apos; the Federal Government may issue emergencyecrees having the force of law. This power is seriously limited by the followingperating together :  - /,One of the legislative bodies must be prevented from fulfilling its func-tions by force majeure (a condition capable of legal definition);the Presidents of the Volkstag and the Bundesrat must approve;the decrees must refer to matters within federal competence;the decrees must be confirmed by the Volkstag and Bundesrat within four weeks unless the original conditions of force majeure continueto operate when the decrees may be extended for four weeks each,time;the decrees may affect only the Basic Rights concerning freedom of thepress, assembly and association and the secrecy of telecommunications;andno elections can take place during this period if these Basic Rights are affected.oreover the decrees become invalid if either of the legislative bodies demandtor if both do not confirm&apos; them in four weeks. The possibility is also openor any Land to challenge the legality of the action before the Federal Constitu-ional Court.  It can be said that the requirement has been met.(c) Distribution of powers between the Federation and the Lander.- Thenumeration of the powers of the Federatibri is contained mainly&apos; in Articles 35,6 and 36a. All powers hot expressly given to the Federation belong tb&apos;the Land,he only requirement of the aide-memoire is that certain powers should be reservedthe Lander and therefore not wasted in the Federation. Presumably thearliamentary Council was free to allocate the powers as they thought best36664 &quot;... . &apos;    . ; &apos;  . . e.
provided this specific requirement and the general principles were not violated.An examination of the Articles shows that the Federation has been given priority in legislation in matters of public welfare and some matters of public healthwhich should have been left to the Lander under the aide-memoire, although theFederation could have certain powers of co-ordination. It should be pointedout, however, that under Article 36 the Lander are still free to legislate on thesematters and that federal legislation is to be limited to regulating &quot;only whatmust be uniformly regulated.&quot; This is a vague phrase and goes further thatthe co-ordination referred to in the aide-memoire. this then, is the first instanceof failure of the Basic Law to conform with the aide-memoire^In this connection the federal power in the police field must be approvedby the Military Governors. Article 35 gives the Federation exclusive lejpslationon &quot; co-operation of the Lander in the criminal poliee and the establishment ofa Federal Office for Criminal Affairs.&quot; It is not clear from this what powers the Federation will have in the police field. It will be necessary to wait until a federal law is introduced on the subject, if ever;. It is; not envisaged that theFederation will have policemen under its jurisdiction as no provision thereforis; made in Article 116 which describes the direct federal administrations. Theother mention of police is in Article 118c, where, in the case of a grave emergency,a Land may call in the police forces of other Lander. Should the Land in whiehthe danger is imminent not be in a position or fail to take action the federal government may take over command of the police of that Land or of otherLander. The Bundesrat can at any time require the action of the Federal Gbvem-ment to be rescinded.  This would appear unobjectionable.(d) Limitation of federal financial powers. There can be no doubt that the basic Law diverges from the requirements of the aide-memoire in the followingparticulars: -(i) It empowers the Federation to raise and appropriate considerablerevenues, thus raising and appropriating revenue for purposes otherthan those for which it is responsible.(ii) It gives the Federation power to legislate on taxes for which uniformityis not. essential, nor does it limit this legislation to the setting ofrates- or general principles of assessment.(iii) It gives to the Federation the collection and utilisation of such taxes, bothof which should be left to the individual Lander.The. requirements of the Aide-Memoire were, drafted in order to safeguard therights of the Lander on. the, conception that he. who pays, the piper calls, the tune.Unless the Lander have effective control over the; sources of their own revenue,their other, powers will; be of little use. The most effective way of achieving this control is by completely independent sources of revenue and administration, thereof.This was rejected by the financial experts of the Parliamentary Council as .inefficient, expensive and- difficult of aenievement. They therefore adopted analternative system which is to give to the Bundesrat, which- effectrVelv represents the interests of the Lander; an- absolute veto on fedferal1 financial&apos; legislationaffecting the interests of: the Lander. They added&apos; the provision that air respon-sible heads of the federal financial administration down- to the Ereis should beappointed with the consent of the Land concerned. By these means they tried to accomplish the same ends as the Occupying Powers. Although it is clear tothe members of the Parliamentary Council tnat their financial&apos; provisions arecontrary to&apos; the actual requirements of the Aide-Memoire they claim that they meetthe reasons for these requirements in their alternative system.(e) Provision for an independent judiciaryi-^LRe Basic Law sets up a systemof Land courts for ordinary criminal and civil jurisdiction, but established a federal Constitutional; Court, to. perform the  unctions required, in) the- Aide*]Memoire and it can thus be admitted that this requirement has) been met,.(:/) Power of the Federation, to establish, its. own agenciesi- As-has alreadybeen pointed out the Federations has( only a few agencies: directly under its orders:Further independent.regional,offices may only be set up. for matters, for which theOEederationhaslegislative,powers and-then only withstheconsentof the,Bundesrat(Article 116). The requirements of the. Aide-Memoire limited, the-establishmentof federal agencies to those cases where &quot; State.implementation^is impracticable;&quot;Eor this vaguecriterion which could covereverything,,theBasiGLaw.uses:a clearerand narrower formula. The concept is in both cases the same, and the requirement of the London Agreement appears to have been met.
(g) Freedom of access to public service of a non-political character.^-This requirement was added by the Military Governors. The basic law provides for the free accessibility of the civil service under conditionswhich appear to deny this accessibility (Article 276). There is no provision for*a non-political civil service. This requirement does not therefore appear to havebeen met.(h) IneUgibility of civil servants to simultaneous membership in the Volkstag. This is another requirement imposed by the Military Governors. It is contraryto German practice although some members of the Council claim to agree with it.At present, however, there is no doubt that the Basic Law provides for the contraryprinciple in Article 62. In this respect the requirement has been definitelyrejected.
