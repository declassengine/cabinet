(49) 5814*A March, 1949 :. : :cabinet india&apos;S FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE commonwealth memorandum by the Prime minister circulate herewith, for the information of my Cabinet colleagues, copiesof the following basic documents which have been drawn up for the guidanceof Commonwealth Prime Ministers in preparation for the proposed meeting inApril which is to discuss India&apos;s future relations with the Commonwealth:-(i) Constitutional Questions (Annex &quot;A&quot;).(ii) Most-Favoured-Nation Questions (Annex &quot; B &quot;).(iii) Implications for Commonwealth Countries of India&apos;s Future Status(Annex &quot; C &quot;).These documents will be used by the personal emissaries whom I am sending out for preliminary discussions with Commonwealth Prime Ministers.2. None of these documents will be communicated to the Prime Ministerof India. Copies of the Documents on Constitutional Questions and Most-Favoured-Nation Questions will be handed by the emissaries to the PrimeMinisters of all other Commonwealth countries. Copies of the ImplicationsDocument will be handed only to the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, NewZealand and South Africa.3. In the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 3rd March I have given a personal directive to each of these emissaries. This makes it clear that theyshould begin by outlining the great political advantages of retaining India withinthe Commonwealth especially at a time when the Commonwealth influence ismore than ever needed throughout South-East Asia in combating the encroach-ment of Communism from the north and east. They are then to explain thatsustained efforts have already been made to persuade India to agree that hercontinuing membership of the Commonwealth should be based upon recognitionof the special position of the Crown, but that the United Kingdom Governmenthave come to the conclusion that they alone may not be able to persuade theIndian Government to accept any substantial link through the Crown. Theproposal for a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers has therefore beenput forward in the hope that, if there is a common desire on the part of allother Commonwealth Governments that India&apos;s continued membership ofthe Commonwealth should be founded on continuing recognition of theCrown, the Indian Government may be influenced by the united view of theother Governments and induced to find some means of reconciling such a link with the constitution which their Constituent Assembly are about to adopt. Itis only after emphasising these preliminary objectives of the proposed meeting that the emissaries are to go on to deal with the situation envisaged in the attachedmemoranda. - They will thus make it clear that it is only if these attempts failthat the Commonwealth Governments will be faced with the question, discussed in these papers, whether the constitutional basis of the Commonwealth connection36706
should be so adapted as to enable the Commonwealth to include a republicanIndia which owes no allegiance to the Crown. They will explain that the UnitedKingdom Government have arranged for these papers to be prepared so thatall Commonwealth Governments should be ready to face that situation, if it should arise, and should have considered in advance whether such a change in theconstitutional basis of the Commonwealth connection could be made and whatrisks it would involve.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,Uth March, 1949.
ANNEX &quot;A&quot;THE  COMMONWEALTH  RELATIONSHIPConstitutional QuestionsIThe draft Constitution prepared by the Constituent Assembly in India islikely to be adopted in July and brought into operation on 15th August, thesecond anniversary of India&apos;s attainment of independence. By this newConstitution India will become a &quot;sovereign democratic republic,&quot; and HisMajesty&apos;s sovereignty over India will be extinguished. Over the past four months and more, numerous attempts have been made to persuade the Governmentof India to preserve India&apos;s connection with the Crown, in one way or another,after the adoption of her new Constitution. All these attempts have failed; andit must now be recognised that India will not be willing to accept any substantiallink with the Crown. -If, therefore, the link through the Crown remains the essential qualification for Commonwealth membership, as stated in the preamble to the Statute ofWestminister, it will not be possible for India to remain within the Commonwealthafter she has adopted her new Constitution in August. On the other hand,India has affirmed her desire to maintain her association with the Common-wealth cf. paragraph 8 of Pandit Nehru&apos;s Eight-Point Memorandum (Annex I)and the resolution passed by the Congress Party in December 1948 (Annex II).And Pandit Nehru has clearly indicated that India will not accept any formof special association short of full membership. India&apos;s attitude thus compelsthe other Commonwealth Governments to face the question: are they preparedto agree that the constitutional basis of the Commonwealth connection shouldbe so adapted as to enable the Commonwealth to include a republican countryowing no allegiance to the Crown ?II2. The purpose of this paper is to discuss whether such a change could bemade and what risks it might involve.The immediate objective of making such a change would be to enable India toremain within the Commonwealth. But it should not be considered in relation toIndia alone. It might also meet the views of other peoples, now or formerlyassociated with the Commonwealth, who are disposed towards republican forms ofGovernment. If the Commonwealth could include republican States, it wouldbecome constitutionally possible to receive Eire and Burma back into theCommonwealth if it was politically desirable and practicable to do so. Thechange would certainly have the disadvantage that it might accelerate any existingtendencies towards republicanism within the Commonwealth, and possibly callthem into existence in countries (e.g., in some of the dependent territories) wherethey have not yet shown themselves. On the other hand, it would have the resultthat a dependent territory in which a strong movement towards republicanism had developed would not, on attaining its independence, be faced with the dilemma of abandoning either its desire for a republican form of constitution or its adherence to the Commonwealth. For many years past British Colonial policy has been directed towards developing in the dependent peoples the capacity for self-government and full independence.   It is our natural desire that these peoples,36656 b
when they reach the stage of independence, should choose &quot; independence withinthe Commonwealth.&quot; Many of them may wish, when that time comes, to preservetheir allegiance to the Crown. But some may find it easier to preserve theCommonwealth connection if this does not necessarily involve renouncing allambition for a republican form of Government.Ill3. At present the Crown is the sole constitutional link between the fullyself-governing members of the Commonwealth. In the words of the preamble to the Statute of Westminster, the Crown &quot; is the symbol of their freeassociation &quot; and they are &quot;united by a common allegiance to the Crown.&quot; Ifthe Commonwealth is now to include a republican country which does not acceptThe King as part of its constitution, the allegiance to the Crown will cease to bethe common element in the relationship between all the members of the Common-wealth. It will no longer be the central feature of the Commonwealth relationshipor the essential test for Commonwealth membership.What could be put in its place? From a legal point of view the onlytangible constitutional link would be the Commonwealth citizenship, which is subject to various qualifications discussed in section V below. From the practicalangle, however, there would be the stronger fact of the historical continuity ofthose practices of consultation and co-operation, in peace and war, by which thisfree association of independent peoples has been held together. The continuanceof a special Commonwealth relationship could be justified by reference to thefollowing : (i) The de facto general acceptance by air civilised nations of the existenceof the Commonwealth as a unit composed of nations bound togetherby a factual association of long standing, based up till now on thecommon sovereignty of the Crown, and still continuing,(ii) Declarations by the Governments of all the members of the Common-wealth that they wished to be, and regarded themselves as, still boundin a special form of association.(iii) The practice of consultation between member Governments on all matters of common concern political, strategic, economic and finan-cial and their practical co-operation in many such matters.(iv) Their co-operation, to the extent desired and approved by each Govern-ment, in the military defence of common interests.(v) The preferential treatment which they accord to one another in tradeand commerce.(vi) The Commonwealth citizenship.The rights and obligations involved under some of these heads may not be capableof precise definition. Moreover, the relations between Commonwealth countriesin some of these matters may not be different in form from those between foreign states in close treaty relationship with one another. But, if they are taken together and viewed in relation to the historical association out of which theydeveloped, this list of common features may well, in the aggregate, be held to amount to a relationship which is different in kind from any which subsistsbetween foreign States.4. Part II of the Report of the Balfour Committee, which was incorporated in the summary of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference of 1926 (Cmd. 2768of 1926) contained a definition of the &apos;&apos; Status of Great Britain and theDominions,&quot; which subsequently formed the basis of the statutory definition of the Commonwealth relationship in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster.The significant part of that statement reads as follows : &quot; They [Great Britain and the Dominions] are autonomous communities,within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one toanother in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though unitedby a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members ofthe British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot;5. If that definition had now to be recast in a form applicable to a Common-wealth including one or more republican countries, viz., in a form in which the
allegiance to the Crown was no longer the essential constitutional feature in the mutual relationship between all the members, it might be framed as follows : &quot; The fully self-governing members of the British Commonwealth of nations are : (i) independent sovereign States which owe, or have owed, allegiance to the Crown;(ii) equal in status and in no way subordinate one to another in anyaspect of their domestic or external affairs;(iii) not foreign in relation one to another; and(iv) freely associated as members of the Commonwealth and united with one another [some by their allegiance to the Crown, and all] bytheir acceptance of the principle of consultation on all mattersof common concern and by the rights of common citizenship whichthe nationals of each enjoy in the territories of the others.&quot;There are four separate aspects in this definition: (i) The affirmation of inde-pendent sovereignty and the restriction of membership to countries whichhistorically formed part of the British Empire; (ii) the conception of equal partner-ship and autonomy; (iii) the declaration that the members do not regard them-selves as foreign inter se; and (iv) the positive tests of their association.6. It may not be necessary to proceed by way of issuing, in a public state-ment made on behalf of all Commonwealth Governments, a formal redefinitionof the Commonwealth connection in such terms as these. The earlier definition of 1926 was designed to mark a stage in the orderly development of the Common-wealth relationship and was embodied in a report of the proceedings of an imperial Conference which covered a number of other subjects. A new definition,announced in isolation and obviously designed to keep India within the Common-wealth, would attract far more attention and provoke far greater controversy.Nor is it suggested that a new basis for the Commonwealth connexion shouldbe embodied in a statutory instrument comparable to the Statute of Westminster.As a matter of law, no such statutory declaration would be required. For the preamble to the Statute of Westminister only purports to set out the constitutional position as it existed in 1931. The Commonwealth connection has developed bya steady process of evolutionary growth, not by successive stages of formal defini-tion. If a further change has now to be made, it is important that this should appear to be no more than another stage in that process of continuous development.In the interests of historical continuity, any appearance of a major change inthe constitutional position should be avoided.7. As a matter of procedure it might be possible to limit public announcementsto a solemn declaration of the fact that India remained a member of the Common-wealth despite her adoption of a republican constitution. The main object of such adeclaration would be to show that India&apos;s continuing membership of the Common-wealth rested on a common act of will; and there would therefore be need for reci-procal declarations on behalf of India and on behalf of the other commonwealth governments. The declaration by the Government of India might take the form :&quot;India, on becoming an independent republic, solemnly declares and proclaimsthat it confirms and renews its membership of the British Commonwealth ofNations.&quot; The corresponding declaration on behalf of the Governments of theother Commonwealth countries might take the form: &quot;The self-governingmembers of the British Commonwealth of Nations (the United Kingdom, Canada,Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon) solemnly declareand proclaim that India, on becoming an independent republic, is and continuesto be a member of the Commonwealth.&quot;8. The initial public announcement might perhaps be limited to declarationsin these terms. But the fact would remain that, once India had been allowedto continue in full membership of the Commonwealth despite her adoption of a republican constitution, the basis of the Commonwealth relationship would havebeen changed. The allegiance to the Crown would no longer be the essentialconstitutional feature in the relationship. This could not be concealed. In thepublic discussions which would follow upon any such declaration as is suggestedin the preceding paragraph, all Commonwealth Governments would be pressed to explain what in the new circumstances was the essential constitutional link between the self-governing members of the Commonwealth. In doing so theywould probably find themselves compelled to use statements describing the new36656 t\ o
basis of relationship which, though not textually identical, would be broadly onthe lines indicated in paragraph 5 above. In the following paragraphs of this paper the validity of the hew relationship is therefore tested by reference tothe statement in paragraph 5.IV9. Would there be an effective defence if the continuance of preferential treatment for trade or nationals between the republican members and the othermembers of the Commonwealth were challenged in the International Court asinconsistent with the most-favoured-nation clause of a commercial treaty?These points are discussed in detail in a separate paper on Most-Favoured-Nation Questions. Reference should, however, be made here to a consideration which has influenced the form of the statement in paragraph 5 above. If this new conception of the Commonwealth relationship were challenged in the Inter-national Court, and we had to argue in support of the contention that it was something different from an association of foreign States, we should be forcedto rely largely on the argument that the Commonwealth had evolved, not by theadoption and modification of constitutional formulae, but by a continuous processof organic growth. And it is on the historical continuity of this develpment thatthe main strength of the argument would have to be founded. It is with this inview that the statement in paragraph 5 lays stress on the long historical associa-tion between the republican members of the Commonwealth and the other members,and places correspondingly less emphasis on the link of Commonwealth citizenship.It is also for this reason that the statement contemplates that membership of theCommonwealth should be restricted to countries which have in the past owedallegiance to the Crown and formed part of the British Empire. It would bemuch more difficult to sustain the argument that the members of the Common-wealth are not to be regarded as foreign to one another if foreign countries whichhave not at any recent time owed allegiance to the Crown were admitted, orregarded as eligible for admission, otherwise than by submitting to that allegiance.It is also desirable, though not perhaps essential, that the historical associationshould have been uninterrupted; and it would therefore be expedient that, if this new conception of the Commonwealth relationship were adopted, it should bebrought into effect before the King&apos;s sovereignty over India is finally ended. this consideration need not prevent the return of Eire or Burma to the Commonwealth;but it is desirable, from this point of view, that the interruption of their member-ship should be as short as possible.. W     . : .*     - v       &apos;      H&apos;J;-M.10. What value can be attached to the Commonwealth citizenship as a constitutional tie between the countries of the Commonwealth ?A true common citizenship between two countries would confer on the citizens of the one a right to enter the territory of the other and to share in its government. These rights are at present conceded by the United KingdomGovernment to all Commonwealth citizens as such. In the United Kingdom a commonwealth citizen has a special position as compared to an alien in several important respects. He enters the United Kingdom as of right, whereas an alien may be refused the right of entering; when there, he is not subject todeportation, he is eligible for membership of Parliament and of municipal bodies,and for office under the Crown, civil and military, is free to follow certainoccupations, from which aliens are excluded, and may acquire a Parliamentary ormunicipal vote on the same terms as a United Kingdom citizen; he may own aBritish ship or British aircraft; he is, under certain extradition treaties (but not all), free from liability to extradition; he can claim in certain circumstances tobe registered as of right as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies; if,outside the United Kingdom, he suffers violence, e.g., on the high seas, at the handsof servants of the Crown, he cannot, if he sues for damages in the United Kingdomcourts, be defeated by the bare plea of &quot; Act of State &quot; ; and he has certain otherrights of less practical importance. He has, too, at present, one serious liability to which an alien is not subject, viz., he may, in certain circumstances, be liableunder the existing law to be called up for service in the Armed Forces after twoyears&apos; residence in the United Kingdom.
11. This makes a formidable list. It is true that these rights-and liabilitiesare not necessarily permanent: Parliament is free to vary them. This, however,would not affect the matter if it could be said that the position which obtainsin the United Kingdom obtained in substance all over the Commonwealth.But this is not so. The most important of the rights mentioned in the last paragraph, viz., the right to enter and remain in a country and to influence, byvote and membership of its governmental or public institutions, the way in whichit is governed, is not generally conceded in Commonwealth countries outsidethe United Kingdom to Commonwealth citizens as such.Most of the self-governing countries of the Commonwealth, being countries of immigration, withhold rights of entry into their territory from commonwealth citizens who are not citizens of the territory. In general, it could be argued that this is a reasonable precaution for countries of immigration to take; and,further, that their immigration restrictions are in practice applied less stringentlyto other Commonwealth citizens than to aliens. In addition, however, in some countries Commonwealth citizens of non-European descent are in practicesubjected to discriminatory treatment. Thus, in South Africa, an immigrationrequirement related to economic standards and habits of life is in practice usedto bar the immigration of Cypriots, Maltese and Asiatics. As a consequence, inIndia, persons of non-Indian origin domiciled in South Africa have been declared&quot;prohibited immigrants &quot; and as such are not allowed to enter India without special permits.Similar restrictions on the immigration of Commonwealth citizens are alsoin force in British Colonial territories. Some of these, which are related to continue standards, may in practice operate more severely against commonwealth citizens of non-European descent.Again, outside the United Kingdom Commonwealth citizens do not enjoyan unqualified right to share in the government of other Commonwealth countriesin which they reside, There is, in general, a substantial residence qualification for the franchise which applies to Commonwealth citizens from other parts ofthe Commonwealth as it applies to aliens. Thus, in Canada, the franchise isnot exercisable until Canadian domicile has been obtained by five years&apos; residencein Canada. And in South Africa, though Commonwealth citizens of Europeandescent may obtain the franchise after one year&apos;s residence, the franchise is wl lollydenied to Commonwealth citizens of Asiatic origin.12. It is not yet known what rights India is likely to accord in future to commonwealth citizens who are not Indian nationals. It is true that pandit nehru has offered (paragraph 2 of Annex I) to incorporate in a Nationality act the relevant provisions of the British Nationality Act, 1948, &quot;which will havethe effect of making Indian nationals Commonwealth citizens and the nationals of any Commonwealth country Commonwealth citizens when they are in India.&quot;The Indian Government contemplate that this will be on a basis of reciprocity;but they have not yet given any indication of the practicalcontent of Commonwealthcitizenship in India.As at present drafted, and unless it is modified by the Constituent Assemblyas a result of any agreement between other Commonwealth countries and India,the Indian Constitution will confer on Indian citizens legal rights enforceableby the courts which are much more extensive than any given by the law in thiscountry to citizens of the United Kingdom. For example, the Constitution willprovide that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters ofemployment under the State. It can hardly be intended that these rights shallbe extended in their entirety to Commonwealth citizens who are not Indiannationals.As regards the franchise, clauses 290 and 291 of the draft Constitutionleave many things to be settled thereafter, but both these clauses are expressed as &quot; subject to the provisions of this Constitution &quot; and among these are the express provisions (clauses 67 (6) and 149 (2)) that elections shall be &quot;on thebasis of adult suffrage, that is to say, every citizen who is not less than 21 yearsof age, and who is not otherwise disqualified, shall be entitled to register as avoter at such elections.&quot; The implication appears to be that Indian citizensonly shall have the vote.As regards entry and expulsion, the special protection provided by theGovernment of India Act for United Kingdom nationals has been eliminated,and there is nothing to prevent the Indian authorities (though they have not yetdone so) from legislating to restrict the right of entry of citizens of other commonwealth countries or to give power to deport them.36656 b 3
The Constitution also provides that no person who is not an Indian citizenshall in future be eligible for appointment as a Judge.13. The conception of Commonwealth citizenship is not, therefore, atpresent supported by any comprehensive system of equal and compensatingcitizenship rights and obligations applying evenly throughout the Commonwealth.And in the absence of such a system of substantial reciprocity, the Common-wealth citizenship could not alone and in itself be regarded as a sufficientconstitutional link to justify the claim that the Commonwealth countries are notforeign to one another. On the other hand, it could be put forward as a secondaryor supporting argument in a general case based mainly on the historicalcontinuity of the Commonwealth connection. And it could fairly be added thatthe new scheme of Commonwealth citizenship launched by the British nationality act, 1948, is a recent development in the constitutional relationship which is atpresent in an early stage.VI14. If the basis of the Commonwealth relationship were changed on the lines indicated in paragraph 5 above, should India be urged to adopt any such&apos;&apos; tenuous &apos;&apos; links with the Crown as she may be willing to accept ?Pandit Nehru, in his latest message, does not in fact place any weight on the&quot; tenuous &quot; links with the Crown. He how puts forward only one point whichcould be regarded as constituting any kind of link with the Crown, viz.,the suggestion (paragraph 6 of Annex I) that, for the purpose of fulfilling theobligations of the Crown towards Commonwealth citizens other than Indiannationals, the President of the Indian Republic should act on behalf of the Kingwithin the territories of India, and that a similar arrangement should be madeon a reciprocal basis in respect of Indian nationals in the rest of the Common-wealth. It is suggested that this particular proposal should in any event be rejected on its merits. It is open to objection on two grounds. First, an indian national like any other Commonwealth citizen, or even an alien owing localallegiance would have the right to the protection of the Crown while in any territory over which His Majesty exercises jurisdiction; and he could not be deprived of that right, or given any greater right, by virtue of any arrangement made at the request of the President of India. As the English Law Officers havestated: &quot;It will, in fact, be by virtue of the United Kingdom law that the preferential treatment, if any, is accorded. If that law provides for it, the Kingwill be bound to accord it. If that law withholds it, the King will be bound to withhold it. The request, therefore, can only be a fiction.&quot; Secondly, althoughPandit Nehru&apos;s formula avoids saying so in terms, the proposal clearly implies that the King should act as the agent of the President of India. This is hardlya position which Ministers could advise His Majesty to accept.15. Other &quot; tenuous &quot; links have, however, been suggested in discussions withrepresentatives of the Indian Government. Thus, it has been suggested that theKing might institute a new Commonwealth Order, comparable to the Order ofMerit, for which citizens of any Commonwealth country would be eligible who had given outstanding service to the Commonwealth. This suggestion has not beennally rejected by Pandit Nehru; and it is possible that other similar links might be devised. From the point of view of easing the transition from one kind of constitutional relationship to another, there would be value in preserving some ofthe Commonwealth links with India through the Crown. Such links shouldnot, however, be regarded as a basis on which a constitutional relationshipcan be founded. The reality of the existing constitutional link betweenthe members of the Commonwealth is their allegiance to the Crown.Eire&apos;s recognition of the Crown through her External Relations Act isnow admitted to have been unsatisfactory, if not derogatory to the true position of the Crown; and some of the &quot; tenuous &quot; links which have recently beendiscussed with representatives of India would in fact have afforded an even lesssubstantial foundation for a constitutional relationship. The fact should be faced that India&apos;s continuing membership of the Commonwealth, if it is accepted,will be founded on the new conception of the Commonwealth relationship, not onany &quot;tenuous &quot; links which she may preserve with the Crown.
788yn16. If the basis of the Commonwealth connection were changed on the lines indicated in paragraph 5 above, would it be expedient to suggest that the relation between those members of the Commonwealth which still owed allegiance to theCrown was more intimate than, or in any way different in quality from, the relation between those members and the republican members of the Commonwealth ?In countries which still preserve the link with the Crown there would be many who would wish to emphasise the significance of the Crown connection. Andthere would, doubtless, be political difficulties in discouraging manifestations ofloyalty to the Crown which were designed to establish that the status of thosecountries differed from that of the republican members of the Commonwealth. Itwould, however, be important to avoid the inference that there was some practicalor constitutional difference between the republican and the other members. Anysuch differentiation would lead inevitably to the conception of a &quot;two-tier&quot;Commonwealth, and there are grave difficulties, both constitutional and practical,in such a conception. First, it may be difficult to defend, against a challenge basedon the most-favoured-nation clause of a commercial treaty, preferential treatment between members of a Commonwealth not all of whom are united by a commonallegiance to the Crown. But it would almost certainly be impossible to defendthat position if, within the Commonwealth, there was some distinction of constitutional status between those members who owed the allegiance and those who did not. In a &quot; two-tier &apos;&apos; Commonwealth it would probably be found impossibleto maintain a system of preferential treatment as between the full members and the&quot;associate&quot; members. Secondly, if any such distinction were to be made, itmight become necessary to define the constitutional position of the &quot; associate&quot;-members. But it would probably be found impossible to devise a formof relation between the full members and the &quot;associate&quot; members which could be clearly differentiated from the relation between foreign states in close treaty relationship. Thirdly, any definition of the obligations of&quot; associate &quot; members would by implication suggest that still greater obligationsrested upon the member States a suggestion which is unlikely to prove acceptable to the member Governments. Fourthly, there would be very great practical diffi-culties in handling Commonwealth relations on a &quot;two-tier&quot; basis. Theadoption of such a basis would imply closer consultation between the full membersthemselves than between the full members and the &quot; associate &quot; members; but, inpractice, closeness of consultation and co-operation depends on community ofinterest, not on differences of constitutional status.17. If the adoption of the &quot; two-tier &quot; conception would solve India&apos;sproblem, these difficulties might have to be faced. But it has already been made clear that India will not accept any solution on the lines of a special association with the Commonwealth short of full membership. And her reason for rejectingthat solution is, plainly, that she will not accept any constitutional position inwhich her status in relation to other Commonwealth countries is inferior to, oreven different from, that of Pakistan and Ceylon. It follows that India wouldnot be willing to remain within a Commonwealth in which those members whichretained the allegiance to the Crown were regarded as having some specialCommonwealth status inter se which was not enjoyed by the republican members.Thus, the proposal to modify the basis of the Commonwealth relationship wouldaltogether fail in its immediate purpose (of enabling India to remain within theCommonwealth) if the Commonwealth were re-defined in a form which gave some special status to those members which still retained their allegiance to the Crown.VIII18. Would this new conception of the Commonwealth relationship in thelong run damage the position of the Crown in those Commonwealth countrieswhich still retain the allegiance ?It is true that, if this new conception were adopted, it would be possible and, indeed, necessary to maintain that there was no change in the constitutionalrelation with the Crown of those members of the Commonwealth which stillowed the allegiance. And a majority of the Commonwealth countries would continue to be linked together by their allegiance to the Crown. But theallegiance would no longer be a feature of the Commonwealth relationship orthe essential test for Commonwealth membership.   It would cease to be the
common element in the relationship between all members of the Common-wealth; and the Crown would no longer be the &quot; symbol of their free association.&quot;It cannot be denied that there is a very real danger that this change might,in the end, weaken the position of the Crown even in those countries which now wish to maintain the Crown connection unimpaired. The King would no longer be the supreme head of the Commonwealth. The historical value of the Crownin the Commonwealth relationship would be diminished. The position of theKing as an influence &quot; above politics &quot; in his relations with all Governmentsof the Commonwealth would De lost. When the Commonwealth included a republican member, it might be thought that there would be some risk ofprovoking political controversy or unfortunate incidents by making the traditional references to the Crown connection on occasions when all membersof the Commonwealth were represented. It might even be found expedient onthis account to curtail or modify some of those occasions, such as the broadcastprogramme preceding His Majesty&apos;s Christmas Day address, which havehitherto served to reflect the sentiments of loyalty and affection which nowlink all the peoples of the Commonwealth with the Crown. And there can beno doubt that the King is the symbol and expression of that community of feeling which has hitherto been the mainspring of co-operation, particularly at times of crisis, between the Commonwealth peoples.19. These considerations would prompt the criticism that the republicanmembers of the Commonwealth would obtain all the advantages of commonwealth membership without accepting any of the &quot; obligations.&quot; This criticism maynot be logically valid, but it will not be easy to meet. The point has been made against the arrangement by which Eire is not to be treated as a foreign countrydespite the passage of the Republic of Ireland Act; and, even though thecomment is not there justified, since Eire will be debarred from numerous advan-tages of Commonwealth membership such as were mentioned in the lord chancellor&apos;s speech in the House of Lords on 15th December (Annex III), inthe United Kingdom at any rate Ministers have not so far succeeded in dispellingthe impression that Eire has by this arrangement secured &apos;? something fornothing.&quot; Though the situation would in fact be different, there seems little doubt that in Parliamentary discussions the same argument would be used againsta system by which republican countries continued to be members of the Common-wealth, and to derive the full advantages of membership, when they no longerrecognised the allegiance to the Crown.February 1949.
989ANNEX IPandit Nehru&apos;s Memorandum of 11th December, 19481. The declaration as to the status of India will be left as at present in thedraft Constitution.2. In a Nationality Act, to be passed by the Indian Legislature, contem-poraneously with the coming into effect of the new Constitution, there will be incorporated the substance of the relevant provisions of the British nationality act, 1948, which will have the effect of making Indian nationals commonwealth citizens and the nationals of any Commonwealth country Commonwealth citizenswhen they are in India. This arrangement will be on a reciprocal basis.&quot; Commonwealth &quot; in this connection does not mean a super-State but standsfor an association of free and independent States which accept this concept of commonwealth citizenship.3. As soon as the constitutional changes are settled, or at such other time as may be agreed upon, the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister ofthe United Kingdom will make declarations announcing the changes and their nature and results.4. In any new legislation, or new treaties entered into with other countries,the Commonwealth countries will not be treated as foreign States and theircitizens will not be treated as foreigners.In particular, in any new commercial treaties it will be made clear that forthe purpose of the &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; clause the Commonwealth countries are in a special position and are not regarded as foreign States.5. In foreign States where the Indian Government has no representation,it will be at liberty to make use of any other Commonwealth country&apos;s ambassadoror minister; and the Indian Government will be willing to provide reciprocalfacilities for any Commonwealth Government that so desires.6. For the purposes of fulfilling the obligations of the Crown towardsCommonwealth citizens other than Indian nationals, the President of the IndianRepublic may at the request of the Crown act on behalf of the King within the territories of India. A similar arrangement on a reciprocal basis will apply to indian nationals in the rest of the Commonwealth.7. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the position is that generallyspeaking The King waived all functions of sovereignty in relation to India infavour of the people of India in pursuance of the Act of 1947. Under thatAct there would be no further legislation on India by the Parliament of theUnited Kingdom, and after India&apos;s new Constitution comes into force there canbe no such legislation. The Indian people and their representatives, includingthe President of the Republic, will thus exercise all functions of sovereignty.8. These proposals represent a sincere desire to continue the Commonwealthassociation and what is practical and adequate at present. No doubt as the rela-tionship is not a static arrangement, further development by way of associationmay take place.ANNEX IIText of Congress Party Resolution of 16th December, 1948The National Congress has, even while it was struggling for the freedom ofIndia, associated itself with progressive movements and struggles for freedom inother countries. India&apos;s liberation was viewed as a part of the larger freedomof all the countries and peoples of the world. In particular the Congress has stood in the past for the ending of all Imperialist domination and Colonial exploita-tion of any country or people and has opposed Fascism and all other tendencieswhich suppress the human spirit. The achievement of independence brought newresponsibilities to India in international affairs and it became necessary todevelop direct and closer contacts with other nations. Congress welcomes thesecountries and trusts that they will lead to mutual understanding and co-operation and the promotion of world peace.
The foreign policy of India must necessarily be based on the principles that have gained Congress in the past years. These principles are the promotion of world peace, the freedom of nations, racial equality and the ending of Imperialismand Colonialism, In particular, Congress is interested in freedom of the nations and peoples of Asia and Africa who halve suffered under various forms ofColonialisation for many generations; with a view to advancing the cause of world peace and co-operation India associated herself with United Nations. ThisCongress declares its full adherence to the principles of the Charter of united nations. It should be the constant aim of the foreign policy of India to maintainfriendly and co-operative relations with all nations and to avoid entanglementin military or similar alliances which tend to divide up the world in rival groups and thus endanger world peace. Maintaining her freedom of action in foreignaffairs and in the economic development of the country, India should continue to function as a member State of United Nations co-operating with other States inmaintenance of peace and freedom.In view of the attainment of complete independence and the establishmentof the Republic of India which will symbolise that independence to give to india the status among the nations of the world that is her rightful due, her presentassociation with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations will necessarily have to change. India, however, desires to maintain all such links with other countries as do not come in the way of her freedom of action and independence, and the Congress would welcome her free association withindependent nations of the Commonwealth for their common weal and the promoting-tion of world peace. India is especially concerned with her neighbour countries of Asia and the Congress trusts that closer bonds of fellowship and co-operativeeffort for the maintenance of the freedom of Asian nations and their progressTvill be developed.ANNEX IIIExtract from Speech by the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords on15th December, 1948Mr. Churchill asked in another place, and the noble Marquess the leader of the Opposition asked here : Why should Eire retain all the advantages of membership? But, my Lords, does Eire retain those advantages? Surely, thegreat benefit the Commonwealth brings is the joint consultation, alike in matterscivil and military, the sharing of information, and the resulting solution ofcommon difficulties. But Eire is not to receive that constant flow of information,much of which is secret and confidential, which goes to Commonwealth Govern-ments on matters of foreign policy and economic affairs; she is not to be broughtinto the consultation which goes on within the family circle of the Commonwealthon all matters of common interest; she is not to be treated as a partner with commonwealth countries in matters of defence; she is not to get the specialinformation, consultation, advice and assistance of military missions which areexchanged between Commonwealth countries; she is not to be invited to the periodical meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, or to other meetingsof Commonwealth Ministers, and she is not to be entitled to membership of commonwealth committees which now exist or may be appointed to deal withtechnical questions. No one has greater experience of these matters than thenoble Viscount the Leader of the House and the noble Marquess the Leader ofthe Opposition. But I would venture to say that the flow and interchange ofcommunication and information, and the sharing of common tasks and commonperils, are the hallmark and the importance of the Commonwealth relationshipFrom all those things Eire must now be excluded. Not by our wish, but by her own act, she has made it plain that she is no longer a member of theCommonwealth.
ANNEX &quot;B&quot;THE COMMONWEALTH RELATIONSHIPMost-Favoured-Nation QuestionsBY a series of treaties the United Kingdom Government are under an obligation to accord to other countries &quot; most-fayoured-nation treatment&quot;, thatis to say, to accord to the particular country with which the treaty is madetreatment at least as favourable as that accorded to any other foreign country.Under the full commercial treaties, of which some thirty are in force, this obligation extends alike to goods and to persons and companies (as well as shipping, &amp;c). The most-f avoured-natibn obligation is also laid down, in respectof goods only, in a number of trade agreements concluded since the 1930&apos;s:many of these are with countries with which the United Kingdom already had full commercial treaties, though some are with countries with which she hadno such treaty.The precise terms of the most-favoured-nation clauses (which are, of course,reciprocal, and apply to both the parties to each agreement) vary to some extentfrom one agreement to another, but a common essential feature of practically all of them (except the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: see (3) below)is that the obligation is expressed as being to accord to the other country partyto the agreement treatment in all respects as favourable as that accorded to anyother foreign country &quot;. The precise significance of the expression &quot; any other foreign country&quot; is therefore crucial for the interpretation of the obligations under the agreements. Most of the more recent agreements contain specificdefinitions of this expression, while the earlier agreements leave its significanceto be inferred by implication.. Broadly there are, in this respect, three main categories of agreements: (1) The full commercial treaties, which, while normally not defining &quot; foreign country &quot;, everywhere use this term in direct contrast to His Majesty&apos;sdominions&quot; (or the equivalent, such as &quot;territories under HisMajesty&apos;s sovereignty, suzerainty, protection or mandate &quot;) on theother side of the picture.  (List in Annex 1.)(2) The trade agreements of the 1930&apos;s and since, which-(a) define &quot; foreign country &quot; as not a part of the British Common-wealth (Scandinavian agreements of 1933 list in Annex 2); or(6) define &quot; foreign country &quot; as not a territory under His Majesty&apos;ssovereignty, &amp;c. (Poland 1935, &amp;c. -list in Annex 3); or, in place of a definition,(c) provide that nothing shall entitle the foreign party to claim thebenefit of any preference, &amp;c, in force exclusively betweenterritories under the sovereignty, &amp;o, of His Majesty (France1934, Soviet Union 1934, &amp;c. list in Annex 4).(Categories (b) and (c) are practically the same in effect.)(3) The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, concluded at Geneva in1947 (relating to goods only). The territories now or formerly forming part of the Commonwealth between which preference is sanctionedare listed nominatim in Annex A to that Agreement, without any reference either to the Commonwealth relationship or to the Crownlink: this list includes India (as on 10th April, 1947, i.e., Pakistanis also covered), &quot;Ireland &quot; [sic], and Burma. (The parties in thisAgreement are listed in Annex 5.)Categories (2) (a), (&amp;) and (c) and (3) apply practically only to goods (2) (a)and (3) exclusively so, while the most-favoured-nation provisions relating to nationals are nearly all of type (1).  Most of the countries comprised under (2)36678b
and (3) also have treaties under (1). Some countries come under all the categories,viz., (1), one of the forms of (2), and also (3). It is probably safe to regard thelatest agreement as prevailing in these cases, which affect only goods.2. The broad effect is that, in the case of countries coming under (1),(2) (b) or (c), if they are not also parties to the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade, the test is &quot;sovereignty of His Majesty&quot;. For countries comingunder (2) (a), membership of the British Commonwealth suffices subject to the argument that that expression means the British Commonwealth as constitutedat the time of the treaty and is not satisfied by the ipse dixit of two countries that they regard themselves as belonging to the British Commonwealth. Forcountries under (3), i.e., the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, neitherHis Majesty&apos;s sovereignty nor Commonwealth membership is material.3. The conclusion f roin what has already been said is that, as regards goods,the potential challengers of the United Kingdom&apos;s action would be those countrieswhich possess treaty rights of the types cited at (1), (2) (6) arid (2) (c) above,excluding those which fall under (3) and probably (subject to the argumentindicated) those which fall under (2) (a), viz.: Albania, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,* Colombia,&quot; Costa Rica, Egypt,Finland,&quot; Greece,&quot; Haiti,&quot; Hungary, Iceland, Nicaragua,&quot; Poland, Portugal,Roumania, Salvador,&quot; Siam, Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey,Uruguay,&quot; Venezuela, Yugoslavia.4. The English Law Officers are therefore of opinion that, in respect of thetrade preferences affecting goods, the countries listed in paragraph 3 above wouldbe legally entitled, once India had ceased to acknowledge allegiance to the Crown,to claim the benefit of the preferences which the United Kingdom accords to goodsoriginating in India.On the other hand, the United Kingdom should be immune from such claims from the countries which are parties, to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade, and probably also from the Scandinavian countries, unless she were togrant the preferences to some other foreign country, in which case these countriesalso wOuld be entitled to lay a claim.It is possible, though by no means certain; that foreign countries wouldrefrain from most-favoured-nation claims if India remained a part of theCommonwealth; and the maintenance of preferences would have to be justifiedin any discussion which might take place about the matter in the United kingdom parliament or elsewhere by arguments analogous to those devised to meet the caseof Eire, which would be based largely on the continuing de facto relationship.Their nature is explained more fully in paragraphs 16 and 17 below.5. As regards nationals, the relevant agreements practically all fall undercategory (1) except for two treaties, those with. Siam of 1937 and with Muscatof 1939, which contain a definition of type (2) (b) The General Agreement isinapplicable; and all the cases turn on the test of &quot; His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty &quot;or   His Majesty&apos;s dominions &quot;.The list of countries possessing such mbst-f avoured-nation rights as regardsnationals is: Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Czechoslovakia, Denmark,Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Liberia, Morocco, Nicaragua,: Peru, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey,United States, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.Most-favoured-nation claims in respect of nationals would be most likely tobe brought in respect of rights of entry and residence in the United Kingdom (theother cases in which the treatment of foreigners in the United Kingdom is inferiorto the treatment of British subjects being relatively few arid unimportant). an example of a modern standard most-favbured-natibn provision relating to thesematters is Article 4 of the Anglo-Roumanian Treaty of i930, which reads : &quot; The subjects of either of the high contracting parties shall be entitledto enter, travel and reside in the territories of the other so long as theysatisfy and observe the conditions and regulations applicable to the entry,travelling and residence of all foreigners.&quot;* These countries are about to negotiate for adherence to the General Agreement on tariffs and T&apos; ie, and may be admitted to it before the summer is out.
6. The English Law Officers consider that all the countries having most-favoured-nation rights in respect of the entry and residence of persons wou^dbe legally entitled to make claims to treatment in this respect as favourable asthat accorded in the United Kingdom to Indian nationals once India had ceased to acknowledge, allegiance to the Crown. It is again possible, though by ho means certain, that they would refrain from such claims if India remained a part ofthe Commonwealth; and in this event the continued extension to Indian national?of treatment not accorded to. the nationals of foreign countries could perhaps bemausibly justified politically by the use of arguments of the kind mentioned inparagraph 4. But if a claim were made which had to be settled judicially, theLaw Officers do not think those arguments would prevail.7. From what has been said above, it will be gathered that the risk of a challenge before the International Court on most-favoured-nation groundsinvolved in allowing a republican country to remain a member of the Common-wealth depends on the type of treaty clause at issue in each case. As regardsthe treatment of goods, there would be no appreciable direct risk in relation to countries parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and probablylittle in relation to the Scandinavian countries, in view of the fact that the definition of &quot; foreign country &quot; in the 1933 trade agreements with them is byway of antithesis to countries members of &quot; the British Commonwealth ofNations &quot;. In all other cases, whether in relation to goods or nationals, the anti-thesis is between &quot;foreign country&quot; and &quot; His tylajesty&apos;s dominions&quot; or&quot; territories under His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty &quot;, &amp;c. In these cases, the questionwhether the United Kingdom could legitimately grant preference to a countryhaving a republican Constitution would seem, on any strict interpretation of thetreaty clauses, to depend on whether or not the republican form of Constitutionexcluded His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty:8.   Probable Lines of A attack. A challenger might adopt one of two courses :(i) take the matter to The Hague Court or other international arbitration, or(ii) take action under the legal doctrine of reprisals.As regards (i) the United&apos;Kingdom Government would be bound to go toThe Hague Court or to some other tribunal under any treaty which provides for arbitration on disputes. They have such treaties with the countries listed in annex 6. They would similarly be bound to go to arbitration if challenged byany of the countries which have subscribed to the Optional Clause of the Inter-national Court (listed in Annex 7). They might also be invited to go to inter-national arbitration by a country which had no treaty right to take them there.It would in such cases clearly be inexpedient to refuse. Such refusal would ineffect be an admission that they had no case and an invitation to the country con-cerned to adopt course (ii), that of &quot; legal reprisals &quot;.9. As regards the countries from which a challenge would be likely to Come,those having treaty rights to make a challenge have been listed above, in para-graph 3 as regards goods, and in paragraph 4 as regards nationals. It is difficultto forecast which of these countries would in practice be most likely to make a challenge. As regards goods, the challenge would be most likely to come fromthose which compete with India&apos;s products in the United Kingdom market perhaps Argentina, Egypt, Siam or the Soviet Union. As regards nationals,the challenge might come from countries whose nationals come to the UnitedKingdom in appreciable numbers, e.g., France, Sweden, Switzerland, or theUnited States; or possibly some of the &quot; Iron Curtain &quot; countries such as Czecho-slovakia, Hungary, Roumania or Yugoslavia might do so in order to raise politicaltrouble.   (The Soviet Union have no relevant rights as regards nationals.)10. On the whole challenges in regard to the treatment of goods may beregarded as rather more probable than in regard to nationals, since the treaty pro-visions are more clear-cut in the former case and their observance or non-observanceis probably easier to establish. The position which would arise in regard to thetreatment of nationals cannot, however, be completely ignored. The rights of entry,residences and franchise are not without importance, although perhaps more so to individual foreigners than to foreign States. Apart from these rights, however,there are not many cases of significance where greater privileges are in practicegiven to British subjects than to foreigners. 0 &apos;11.   It is of course possible that a challenge might be raised against Indiainstead of the United Kingdom.   Argentina, Switzerland and a number of othercountries have most-favoured-nation treaty rights with India, and the UnitedStates are negotiating for such a treaty. &quot;The form of these treaties is usuallv36678 B o
such as would enable the countries concerned to claim on most-favoured-nationgrounds treatment for their goods and nationals as favourable as that accordedin India to United Kingdom goods or nationals. Among these countries, thosewhich are not parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade could layclaims in regard both to goods and nationals, while even those which are partiesto the General Agreement could lay claim in regard to nationals. On the whole,it seems rather more probable that the attack might come in this form than in theform of a challenge to the United Kingdom.12. Likely consequence of a successful attack.-Ii the United Kingdom were taken to international arbitration either in respect of goods or of nationals(course (i) in paragraph 8) and lost her case, she would clearly have to cease givingIndia the preferential treatment in respect of which the challenge had arisen and very possibly in all respects. If she were thus compelled to cease givingpreference to India, she would almost certainly have to cease also giving it to eire and Burma (which, unlike India, are not even parts of the Commonwealth):but her preferences to all other parts of the Commonwealth would be unaffectedand could continue. It is also possible that the Court might award monetarydamages in respect of the period of default. As regards this possibility, two cases fall to be considered (1) where the Court has compulsory jurisdiction, i.e., where the UnitedKingdom is obliged to go to the Court if the other party to the disputerequires her to do so (see (i) in paragraph 8, and Annexes 6 and 7);and(2) where there is not compulsory jurisdiction and the United Kingdom canonly be taken to the Court with her consent.In case (1), the complainant party could, at any rate as a matter of legal theory,ask for damages, though in practice it might well refrain from doing so, since a precedent might be set which could in due course recoil upon itself. It would bea matter of great complexity to assess the damages if they were claimed; theirexact amount would have to be proved : this would be difficult, but the amountsmight be very large.   The risk is thus remote, but a big one.In case (2), the United Kingdom would only go to the Court on agreed terms,and these terms could exclude the question of damages from the reference to theCourt. (It is however possible that if a country won its case in principle againstthe United Kingdom under (2), other countries which are entitled to take her to the Court under (1) might then intervene with claims for damages.)Where a country adopts the method of reprisals (course (ii) in paragraph 8)instead of resorting to arbitration, the extent of the damage to United kingdom trade would depend on the nature and extent of the reprisals.13. Possibilities of averting a challenge. As regards possibilities ofaverting a challenge, the United Kingdom could of course threaten any intendingchallenger that she would denounce her treaty with him if he pressed his challenge.That would, however, practically amount to an admission that the challenge wasvalid. Whether the threat would be effective or not would depend on therelative importance which the United Kingdom and the challenger respectivelyattached to retaining most-favoured-nation rights at the other&apos;s hands, and onthe challenger&apos;s estimate of the relative loss he would incur on the one hand,by acquiescing in the United Kingdom preference as against his goods andon the other, by suffering the loss of his most-favoured-nation rights in theUnited Kingdom. Since the United Kingdom normally gives most-favoured-foreign-country treatment to all foreign countries, whether they have treatyrights or not, and does not, like some countries, have a &quot;general tariff&quot; anda &quot; minimum tariff &quot;, of which the higher is applicable to a country not possessingmost-favoured-nation treaty rights, her threat to denounce the treaty might be something of a brutum fulmen. Even if she did.-, denounce it, that would,so far as the legal consequences are concerned, only prevent a case against herbeing taken to arbitration in respect of any period after the treaty had lapsed:it would not protect her against an award of damages in respect of the periodwhile the treaty still remained in force and she was in default on it. The termof notice, of denunciation of different treaties varies commonly it is one year for commercial treaties and six months for trade agreements. In any case, if thetreaty is denounced, the other party is freed from all the restrictions on itsliberty of action which the treaty creates and would, therefore, be free to do all that it would probably want to do by way of reprisals if the treaty werein force and the United Kingdom Government were infringing it. If the challenge
came only from a small country whose trade was comparatively unimportantto the United Kingdom or a country whose market was less important to herthan her market was to it, she might be able to use the threat of denunciationeffectively to induce it to drop its challenge. But the situation would differ from case to case.14. Short of terminating a treaty, it would also be possible to negotiatefor its amendment so as to make it clearly sanction the disputed preference.The United Kingdom would, however, be in a disadvantageous position inundertaking such a negotiation; being in the position of the &quot; demander &quot;, itis she who would have to pay the price, and the price asked would probablybe heavy. Nor would there, in many cases, be much choice as regards the form which the price should take. The goods clauses of the full commercial treatiesnormally amount merely to reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment on bothsides, so that a derogation on one side could hardly be matched by anythingexcept a parallel derogation on the other. In other words, the United kingdom could probably only buy the other party&apos;s consent to the disputed preference byconceding him the right to make preferential arrangements with other countries.15. Moreover, by embarking on one such negotiation the United kingdom would expose herself to a whole series of similar negotiations with all othercountries having similar treaties with her, in each one of which she shouldhave to buy off the other party&apos;s objection to her preference. The procedure would, therefore, be highly disadvantageous to her. This would particularlybe so as regards the full commercial treaties, which not only cover most-favoured-nation treatment for goods, but also deal with a wide range of other matters(persons, companies, shipping, industrial property, &amp;c.), for many of which notonly most-favoured-nation treatment but also &quot;national treatment&quot; (i.e., thesame treatment as the nationals, companies, ships, &amp;c, of the other party) isprescribed. All these rights would be put at issue in any re-negotiation on thegoods preferences. Moreover these treaties are very numerous. Thus theirwholesale re-negotiation would be a formidable and lengthy undertaking, andthe net result in the end would almost certainly be to leave the United kingdom in a less advantageous position than she enjoys at present possibly-not only as regards goods, but also as regards the other matters covered by the treaties,as described above. ,16. Arguments that could be used in resisting a challenge. As already seen,the most likely ground for a challenge would be that the territory concerned had ceased to be under His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty and had become &quot;foreign.&quot; Inthose cases ((2) (a) in paragraph 1 and in Annex 2) in which the antithesis is &apos;&apos; nota part of the British Commonwealth &quot;, affirmation both by the United Kingdomand, e.g., India, that both regard it, e.g., India, as part of the British Common-wealth could be made. The effect of this would depend in part on whether theCourt or Arbitrator held those words to refer to the British Commonwealth asconstituted at the time of the Treaty. Even if it were held that the words pos-sessed a wider significance the Law Officers do not think that a Legal tribunal would necessarily accept the ipse diceit of the two countries concerned to the pre-judice of third parties, and it might perhaps feel called upon to consider whetherthe British Commonwealth continued to exist as an internationally recognisableassociation, the members of which were not to be regarded by international law as foreign to each other.In cases where the test is His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty, it would be necessary to try to shift the argument off the strictly legal ground, and to argue that therehad for long been a special relationship, which de facto still continues withoutinterruption, and that the change in the constitutional status of the territory concerned did not affect this position in substance. The effectiveness of this argument would vary from case to case and according to the nature of the pointin dispute. Thus, e.g., in the case of Eire, if the challenge related to the special treatment of Eire nationals in the United Kingdom, arguments about kinshipmight carry some weight; but this argument would not, of course, be available inrelation to India.As regards trade preferences, the length of time for which the preferences have been in effect might be a relevant consideration. (InIndia&apos;s case, the United Kingdom started to give preferences on suchduties as she then had, from the end of the First World War: the wideraccord of preferences generally duty-free entrv to her poods dates from theadoption of the general tariff and the Ottawa Conference in 1932.)   It may be
convenient at this point to summarise the analogies and differences between thecases of India, Eire and Burma, in the circumstances contemplated, (a) None ofthe three would be acknowledging His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty.&apos; But (6) india would consider herself a part of the Commonwealth, whereas Eire and Burma donot. (However, the United Kingdom and Eire do not regard one another as&quot; foreign countries &quot; in the full sense. The position in relation to Burma is different since the United Kingdom has continued preferences in her favour onlyon a tempprary basis.)Consideration (6) would tell in India&apos;s favour in the matter of retainingpreference : it would possibly be decisive as regards possible claims by thosecountries in whose agreements with the United Kingdom &quot;foreign country&quot;is defined as &quot; not a part of the British Commonwealth &quot; (see paragraph 1 (2) (6));and even in cases where His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty is the test (paragraph 1,(1) and 2 (b) and (c)) there will be a better argument in India&apos;s case than inthose of Eire and Burma.On the other hand, so far as reliance is placed on close de factoconnections to justify the preferences, Eire would have a good case on grounds of kinship, proximity, &amp;o, which neither India nor Burma could claim. TheUnited Kingdom&apos;s connections with Eire are necessarily close; they are not so with India or Burma.Whether or not argument on these lines might be plausible politically, theLaw Officers do not think it could be pressed successfully, if at all, before a LegalTribunal.17. This paper is concerned primarily with the strictly legal aspects ofthe problem; but it may be worth noting in conclusion a view put forward bythe Secretary of the External Relations Department of Eire in the course ofthe recent conversations between Eire and United Kingdom officials. Hesuggested that in practice foreign countries are not very likely to concern them-selves with the constitutional niceties of the British Commonwealth; they would,he suggested, be disposed to regard whatever formula was used in a particulartreaty as being merely descriptive of the countries covered at the time of its conclusion by the preferential system and thus as having much the same effect as Annex A to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Their willingnessor otherwise in practice to accept the United Kingdom view as to the countriesproperly covered by the preferences would depend in each particular case ratheron the degree of anxiety of the country concerned to have most-favoured-nationguarantees from the United Kingdom and on the, degree pf her bargainingstrength in relation to it.   There may he considerable force in this view!18. So far there have been no indications of a challenge from any quarterto the United Kingdom preferences to Eire (though of course the Republic ofIreland Act has not yet come into force). But some enquiries have been receivedfrom Siam, in the course of negotiations for the renewal and eventual revisionof the 1937 treaty, about the United Kingdom preferences to Burma and Eire.It remains to be seen whether, in the light of the reply sent to these enquiries,Siam will be willing to continue to accept the preferences to these countries.February, 1949

ANNEX &quot; C &quot;india FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE COMMONWEALTHImplications for Commonwealth CountriesITHIS paper discusses the implications for the Commonwealth political,economic, financial and military of possible constitutional developments in India.It assesses those implications on three hypotheses (i) that India remains a member of the Commonwealth, though owing noallegiance to the Crown;(ii) that India becomes a foreign State in a specially close treaty relationship with the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries;(iii) that India becomes a foreign State with no such close treaty relationship.2. Under the first of these hypotheses it is assumed that, despite the severingof the allegiance, India would continue to maintain the same close relations in all practical affairs as now subsist between her and the other commonwealth countries.Under the second hypothesis it is assumed that, although India had ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth, she would wish her practical association with the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries to be as close and friendly as possible. It is assumed that she would have understood and appre-ciated the reasons why she could not remain formally a member of the Common-wealth, and would have left it in a friendly spirit; and that it would thereforebe possible for Commonwealth countries to conclude with her treaties favourable to their interests as well as to her own and that other relations not governed by treaty provisions would be at least as close as those with any other foreign state.For the purposes of the third hypothesis it is assumed that India wouldtreat as a rebuff the inability of the other Commonwealth countries to find meansof giving effect to her desire to remain within the Commonwealth, and would leave it in a spirit of resentment and hostility. This part of the paper thereforeassumes that India&apos;s future policy towards the Commonwealth would be at leastunco-operative, and possibly hostile.II3. The assessment of the implications under any of these hypotheses mustbe influenced largely by the judgment made of India&apos;s own interests and of theprobable trends of Indian thought and policy towards the West in general and towards the Commonwealth.In paragraphs 6 to 9 below two different estimates are made of the futured development of Indian thought and policy. This paper does not attempt tomake a final judgment between them. That judgment will, however, greatlyinfluence the weight which is attached to the considerations discussed in the later Sections dealing with the three hypotheses about India&apos;s future constitutional development.4. Indians Interests. India is dependent on sea communications, having noland communications with other countries which are adequate for her trade and commerce.   The annual volume of her overseas trade (imports plus exports) is36648 b
at present about  700 millions. Although, in theory, she might supply her own needs for most of the essential commodities, she is in practice unlikely to achieveself-sufficiency for a long period of time, if, indeed, she ever achieves it. Atpresent, and for the foreseeable future, she depends on sea-borne imports for (i) the marginal amount of food required to avert famine (2-3 million tonsa year) drawn mainly from Australia, Burma and Siam, Argentina,the United States and Canada;(ii) oil and lubricants;(iii) capital goods and machinery of all kinds;(iv) certain essential raw materials.She depends largely on the Western Powers for the shipping required to carrythese imports. She also relies on Western countries for the trained technicianswho are essential to her industrial development, and for replacements and spare parts for her existing industrial plant, most of which has been supplied by theUnited Kingdom. Of India&apos;s total trade, 45 per cent, is with commonwealth countries : within this, 28 per cent, is with the United Kingdom.5. Indians also have substantial interests in British Colonial territories.There are large Indian communities in East Africa, in the West Indies, inMauritius, Malaya and Fiji. In all these territories except the West Indieslarge trading interests are also carried on by Indian citizens who are not domiciledthere.6. India&apos;s Foreign Policy. Up to August 1947 India&apos;s foreign policy wascontrolled by the United Kingdom Government. Since then various generalstatements have been made on behalf of the Indian Government, from which thefollowing principles of Indian policy emerge:&apos; (i) India will hold herself detached from Power blocs in international affairs.(ii) She will give full support to the United Nations.(iii) She will oppose &apos;&apos; Colonialism&apos;&apos; in South-East Asia and in Africa,especially in South-East Asia.(iv) She has a particular interest in the countries of South-East Asia.(v) She will keep herself strong for her own defence, and if there is an inter-national conflict will decide her attitude in the light of her own interests. (In one of the statements it is specifically said that india will not necessarily be neutral in such a conflict.)(vi) In a resolution on foreign policy passed by the All-India Congress inDecember 1948, it was stated that when her republican constitution is adopted India&apos;s present association with the United Kingdom and theCommonwealth will necessarily have to change; but India &quot; desires tomaintain all such links with other countries as do not come in the wayof her freedom of action and independence, and the Congress would welcome her free association with independent nations of the Common-wealth for their common weal and the promotion of world peace.&quot;7. It thus appears that India&apos;s interests and her present policy are to someextent in accord with those of other countries of the Commonwealth. There are,however, other factors tending in the contrary direction to which due weight should be given. India has already shown some consciousness of her extremeeconomic dependence on the western world and is already directing her economic policy towards the achievement of greater self-sufficiency. Thus, she aims atdeveloping a mercantile marine which will carry at least 50 per cent, of her trade.She is anxious to increase her industrial development, and with this object in view is aiming at an expansion of her food production. She has shown no reluctance to accept help in the provision of technicians and capital equipment from countries,such as Czechoslovakia, which are under Soviet influence. Her general economic position is, however, such that there are limits to the extent to which she can pursuea policy of economic self-sufficiency.8. Indian Thought About the future trends of Indian thought there can beno certainty.On the one hand it can be asserted that India has many bonds of sympathy with the British way of life. Many educated Indians have been greatly influenced by British educational principles in schools and colleges in India.   All of them are
profoundly influenced by British thought and by the democratic tradition.British Parliamentary institutions have taken root in India and are found intheir full form in the draft of the new Indian Constitution. More Indian studentsstill choose to pursue their studies in the United Kingdom than in any other country. It is certain that Indian opinion was outraged by German aggression in1939, and it is probable that a large part of the Congress Party would havefavoured moral support of the Allied cause and might have favoured military support if India&apos;s constitutional issue had previously been settled. It is remark-able that, even though the political leaders of the Congress Party opposedco-operation in the war, over 2 million Indians volunteered for military service(though about half of these came from areas now in Pakistan) and war productionin India was on a very large scale. It is also remarkable that, in spite of twenty-five years ;of acute political controversy between Indian political leaders and theUnited Kingdom Government, India should still wish to remain associated withthe Commonwealth.9. On the other hand it may be argued that these factors are ephemeral,and that the trend in India is towards the development of national forms ofeducation and culture. India&apos;s present political leaders, who are moderate men with many links with Western thought and culture, may ultimately give place to extremists from the Right or the Left who have not the same appreciation of world affairs or the same admiration for Western thought. India&apos;s naturaldesire to assume the political leadership in Asia is likely to emphasise this trend.Her declared foreign policy contains one element possibly, in Indian eyes, themost important which may be out of harmony with the policy of the UnitedKingdom Government and other Commonwealth Governments. This is the demandfor the ending of &quot; Colonialism.&quot; Although it is the aim of British colonial policy that Colonial territories shall be gradually developed towards self-government, there may be much room for discord about the speed at which this development should proceed. India has already taken a markedly independent lineon certain aspects of foreign policy and her objective of securing the leadershipin Asia may take precedence in the Indian mind over the struggle againstCommunism or any conception of Commonwealth solidarity. It may be that india&apos;s desire to remain within the Commonwealth derives mainly from a wishto profit by past Commonwealth prestige and experience in the pursuit ofpeculiarly Indian aims, and that any contribution which she is prepared to make to the general potential strength of the Commonwealth will be so limited by her divergent interests that it will be more of an embarrassment than a source of strength.10. India&apos;s Financial Policy. A preliminary reference should be made hereto the question of financial relations with India since these depend, not on hermembership of the Commonwealth, but on her membership of the Sterling Area.The considerations under this head tend to some extent to cut across the three alternative hypotheses discussed below; for India could readily remain a memberof the Sterling Area even if she left the Commonwealth as, indeed, Burmahas done.India&apos;s trade is conducted in sterling, and it does not seem likely that she would wish to leave the Sterling Area unless she were impelled to do so by sucha degree of political hostility to the Commonwealth as would induce her to ignore-the possible financial consequences. She has considered leaving the Sterling area during earlier financial negotiations with the United Kingdom Government, butseems to have concluded that it would not be in her own interests to do so. Since thelast of these negotiations were held (in July 1948) it seems likely that anychange in her attitude has been in the direction of favouring continued membership of the Sterling Area. In the first place, she has a substantialhard-currency deficit, which is being met in part from the central reserves ofthe Sterling Area, and she doubtless realises that this will probably continue.And because of her present shortage of food, her development plans and herneed to import consumer goods to counter inflation, she is at present runninga substantial deficit on current account which is also likely to continue, though perhaps on a smaller scale. If this deficit does continue, it can only be met by further releases from India&apos;s blocked sterling balances. These amount at present to  750 millions, and India is likely to conclude that she will have a better chanceof getting generous releases if she remains within the Sterling Area. Secondly,India is likely to conclude that her demands on Commonwealth countries for36648 b 2
scarce commodities, especially capital goods, will receive more sympathetic consideration if she remains within the Sterling Area. Thirdly, there are signsof a greater readiness on her part to ask for the advice of the United KingdomGovernment in financial and commercial negotiations. She has, in fact, a majorinterest in maintaining the value of sterling and in preserving her access to sterling markets, since it is in the form of goods purchased for sterling thatshe will ultimately spend her sterling balances.11. Thus, India&apos;s own interests seem to lie on the side of remaining withinthe Sterling Area, even though she left the Commonwealth. The United KingdomGovernment for their part would not wish, in present circumstances at any rate,to compel India to leave the Sterling Area. Even if she were excluded from it, it is doubtful whether she could be prevented altogether from drawing on thecentral reserves of gold and dollars limited rights of convertibility have hadto be conceded to Egypt, even though she has left the Sterling Area-and, unlessIndia&apos;s drain on the central reserves became much larger (which is by no meansimpossible, in view of her doubtful economic prospects) or her attitude were tobecome so unco-operative as to represent a danger to the Sterling Area, it wouldbe to the advantage of the Commonwealth to retain her within it.12. Military. The military implications of the three hypotheses are discussed in a separate appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff, which is reproduced in the Appendix to this paper.IllFirst hypothesis: that India remains a Member of the Commonwealth, thoughowing no allegiance to the Crown13. Political. The main political advantages to the Commonwealth of retaining India within it, even though she severs her connection with the Crown,may be summarised as follows : (a) In the eyes of the world, and particularly of potential aggressors, the size and power of the Commonwealth would remain ostensiblyunaltered. The change in its constitution which enabled a republicanIndia to remain a member might be regarded as a further example ofthe Anglo-Saxon genius for compromise; and the cohesiveness of theCommonwealth would appear to remain substantially unaltered. the satisfaction of India&apos;s express desire to retain membership whilerepudiating allegiance to the Crown would provide the best possibleconditions for establishing confidence and friendship between India,and the other Commonwealth countries. Continuing consultation and collaboration would enable other Commonwealth countries to influence the young Indian State during its adolescence, and would provideopportunities for influencing Indian policy. Finally, India hopes toexercise great influence in South-East Asia; and the interests of other commonwealth countries in that part of the world would be more likely to be safeguarded if she exercised that influence as a member ofthe Commonwealth.(6) Confidence in the future of the Commonwealth might be seriously shakenif India followed the path chosen by Burma and Eire. Conversely,the strength and prestige of the Commonwealth would be greatlyenhanced if the whole of the India sub-continent, after being freed from &quot;British rule,&quot; elected by the free decision of its peoples to throw in its lot with the Commonwealth. It would be speciallyunfortunate if the Commonwealth countries had to appear to bethrusting out of the Commonwealth an India which openly professedher desire to remain a member, particularly as it could be said thatthe sole basis for her exclusion was the insistence of the member governments on constitutional forms connected with the Crown.Moreover, this would be a most unfavourable moment for such achange-when a large part of South-East Asia is troubled withinternal unrest and political instability, and gravely threatened by communist encroachment from the north and east.
14. On the other hand, this course may have the following political disadvantages : With the passage of time, the Indian outlook may increasingly divergefrom that of the rest of the Commonwealth, and this may be con-conspicuously reflected in her foreign policy. While she may continue toco-operate with the Commonwealth to the extent required by herinterests, her main concern may be with Asian affairs and with estab-lishing her leadership over the nationalist movements in South-east asia. The continued membership of so powerful a State possessinginterests, and pursuing policies different from those of the othercountries of the Commonwealth might be regarded by the rest of theworld as evidence of the unreality of the Commonwealth as an effective and united force at a time of crisis.(b) The effect on India of having successfully compelled the other membersof the Commonwealth to accept a fundamental change in their mutualrelationship might be wholly detrimental to Commonwealth interests.It would be assumed, and not only in India, that the United Kingdomand the other Commonwealth countries were so anxious to gain India&apos;sgoodwill that they were prepared to do so at the cost of undermining the traditional basis on which the Commonwealth has hitherto rested.Foreign countries might read this as a sign of material weakness, not of political wisdom. If, after securing these far-reaching concessions,India wished to pursue policies inimical to other commonwealth interests, more particularly in the field of international affairs, she might use the threat of secession to put pressure on the other Common-wealth Governments not to oppose those policies.(c) Indians might value the Commonwealth relationship more highly if itwere made clear to them that Commonwealth membership is aprivilege which must be paid for.(d) One of the arguments for allowing India to remain within the Common-wealth, though owing no allegiance to the Crown, is that insistence onthe allegiance as the essential qualification for commonwealth membership might eventually have the result that the commonwealth would contract to a point at which its international influence andstanding would be gravely weakened. On the other hand, it is arguable that the retention of the allegiance is necessary to the cohesion of theCommonwealth, and that a Commonwealth united by that link, thoughsmaller, would by virtue of its greater cohesion exercise a greaterinfluence in world affairs.15. Colonial. In a number of British Colonies there are large communities-of Indian (and Pakistan) origin which play an active part in the commercial andpolitical life of the territory. Many of these Indians are Colonial-borh. Thepolicy has been to encourage Colonial-born Indians and all Indians who desireto make their permanent residence in the Colonies to become &quot; British Colonial &quot;citizens rather than &quot;British Indian&quot; citizens. All Indians in the Colonies,however, retain a sentimental affection for India as their homeland. They alsotend to incur local unpopularity as a result of their commercial&apos; and politicalambitions. For both reasons they tend to become segregated from the othercommunities among whom they live. In addition, there are (particularly in malaya and Fiji) many Indian nationals who cannot be regarded as permanentresidents and whose interests may be considered to be a matter of legitimateconcern to the Indian Government. That Government has, however, tended inthe past, particularly in East Africa, to claim a right of interference on behalfof the Indian community generally and not only on behalf of Indians who arenot permanent residents.From the point of view of Colonial administration it would clearly be muchmore convenient if Indians resident in British Colonial territories continued toowe allegiance to the Crown as do the communities among which they live. under any of the three hypotheses discussed in this paper the problems created by theseIndian residents will become substantially more difficult. It is clear, however,that the first hypothesis is the least inconvenient, though it will give rise to various practical problems, especially if Indians in the Colonies opt in largenumbers for Indian citizenship.iI
16. Economic. From the point of view of Commonwealth trade, whether in relation to the goods preferences or to the treatment of Commonwealthnationals, enterprises and interests in India, each of the three hypotheses dis-cussed in this paper is relatively disadvantageous compared with the presentposition under which India still owes allegiance to the Crown. The first, how-ever, is the least disadvantageous of the three. Its relative merit is due (i) tothe general consideration that, while India remains in the Commonwealth, the atmosphere should be more favourable for the maintenance of special relations of a preferential character than if she were outside it and, more particularly,(ii) to the effect of most-favoured-nation clauses in commercial treaties withforeign countries. As regards the latter point, the position is, shortly, that the preferential treatment of persons and enterprises, and to a great extent the goodspreferences, would only be fully safe from challenge before the International Courtby foreign countries possessing most-favoured-nation treaty rights if the link withthe Crown remained in some form. There is a reasonable chance that suchchallenges could be successfully withstood, on common sense and practical groundsrather than on legal grounds, under the first hypothesis (i.e., if India remained amember of the Commonwealth) though, as is shown in the following paragraph,India may have less interest than the United Kingdom in resisting such challengesif they were made. But it is very unlikely that an adequate defence could beput forward under the second hypothesis and it certainly could not underthe third.The preferences fall into two classes A challenge might affect one or the other, or both: a successful challenge on either would in all probability react equally on the other. Once a successfulchallenge were made by any country on either the trade preferences or the special treatment of nationals,  it would probably be necessary to drop all the kingdom and other members of the Commonwealth would, of course, continueunaffected.) The estimate given below of the value of both these forms ofpreference and of the effects of their loss is necessarily limited to the UnitedKingdom, but other Commonwealth countries may suffer similar disadvantages.17. It is not easy to appraise quantitatively the benefit to the UnitedKingdom of the trade preferences with India, though they were undeniably ofgreat assistance in the slump period of the 1930&apos;s and probably still have considerable value. Moreover, it seems probable that the trade preferences whichIndia gives to the United Kingdom are relatively of greater benefit than thosewhich the United Kingdom gives to India.The preferential treatment which (usually combined with duty-free entry)India enjoys in the United Kingdom covers a variety of products (tea, jutegoods, leather, &amp;c.) amounting to about 70 per-cent, of the United Kingdom&apos;total imports from her (over  96 millions in 1948: the United Kingdom takesover 20 per cent, of India&apos;s total exports to the world). India does not regard this treatment as entirely valueless in the long run, especially on items like jutegoods or carpets which the United Kingdom might ultimately want to protectfrom Indian competition. But she imagines that under present conditions mostof her exports would be substantially unaffected by the removal of preference.As a primary producer, she doubts whether any country would wish to restricther exports to any significant degree; and she has long felt that the UnitedKingdom gets much more relative advantage from preferences in India thanIndia gets from preferences in the United Kingdom. It is, therefore, conceivable that United Kingdom preferences in India will gradually disappear over thenext few years, whatever the constitutional relationship may be. (They would no doubt disappear at once if the United Kingdom withdrew her preferencesto India.) About 30 per cent, of the United Kmgdom&apos;s total exports to India(which were valued at some  96^ millions in 1948, or about 6 per cent, of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s total exports to the world) enjoy preference. The most important items are cotton piece-goods, cycles, motor vehicles, various chemical preparations,electrical apparatus, parts, &amp;c. Their value is difficult to assess in the presentsituation since they are afforded a measure of defence against foreign competi-tion by quantitative import restrictions on goods from hard-currency countries(a) trade preferences on goods;(b) special treatment of persons and companies.preferential arrangementsUnited
and the volume of demand from India for consumer goods of every description isheavy. Their value in the not very long run will, however, be considerable,especially with the re-emergence of strong competition from the United States,Japan and Germany and the possible entry of new European competitors intothe market. Moreover, with their removal, the United Kingdom might, on somegoods, face intensified competition from local Indian production protected against United Kingdom goods by a higher duty than at present. Finally, solong as the United Kingdom retains her right to receive preference in India, she can extract some useful negotiating advantage in tariff negotiations with othercountries from the gradual withdrawal if they are to be withdrawn of the preferences themselves.18. The special treatment given to India&apos;s nationals in the United Kingdom(mainly by way of according to them as individuals relatively greater freedomof entry and stay than to foreigners) may not be of very great practical impor-tance to India. But the United Kingdom has interests of great importancein India, in the shape of British enterprises, companies and interests in Indiancompanies, which would be exposed to grave risk if, because of the withdrawalof the special treatment accorded to Indian nationals in the United Kingdom,India were to withdraw from Commonwealth citizens and interests suchprivileges as they still enjoy in India.There are very large United Kingdom commercial interests in India. No esti-mate, even approximate, of their capital value exists, but it is probably somewherebetween  150 millions and  600 millions, of which a considerable part is in private companies. The invisible earnings of this capital are thought to account for about  20 millions a year in the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments with india. In addition, the existence of these interests has a substantial value fromthe point of view of maintaining and promoting United Kingdom trade with india.The continuance of these United Kingdom interests in India depends uponthe continuance of friendly relations between the United Kingdom and India.There is no doubt that they could be very largely eliminated by a deliberate policyof the Government of India to drive them out. Such a policy might take theform either of outright expropriation, or of discriminatory treatment whichmight make it extremely difficult for these concerns to carry on. Outrightexpropriation has been mentioned as the Indian Governments natural remedy for any attempt to repudiate the Indian sterling balances and might be provokedby measures in the financial field, such as the blocking of India&apos;s sterling balances to a degree unacceptable to her. Discrimination could be practised ina great variety of ways, ranging from measures which would virtually driveEuropean businessmen out of India to measures which put them under sufficienthandicap to render them unable in the long run to compete effectively withIndians. It is true that after prolonged efforts some general assurances havebeen obtained from the Government of India on the manner in which they willtreat British interests in India. They have stated that they have no desire toharass or injure them in any way. But in changed circumstances, and particularly if Indians m the United Kingdom were to become aliens and their rights of entry * residence and activities were curtailed, India would be under strong tempta-tion to argue that her assurances could no longer stand.19. If India remained in the Commonwealth, no absolute security wouldbe obtained against any of these risks. It cannot be said that the commonwealth connection contains any obligation to refrain from discriminatory measures inthe internal economic field if this is justified on grounds of national economicnecessity. Nevertheless, to retain India in the Commonwealth seems to providethe best hope of maintaining friendly economic relations and fair treatment forother Commonwealth citizens in India. Moreover, if India remains in theCommonwealth, it becomes possible for her, if she so desires, to give better than&quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; treatment to other Commonwealth citizens in a numberof important respects-though she might be unwilling to continue those con-cessions if foreign countries showed any disposition to challenge them before theInternational Court., It is part of the Indian proposals that they would make provision in their commercial treaties with foreign Powers which would enablethem to do this, and that Commonwealth countries would be declared to be non-foreign for these purposes. The existing position is that United kingdom nationals and, for the most part, other foreign nationals receive national treatment
in India. In certain respects, however, United Kingdom nationals receive nationaltreatment in matters in which foreign nationals do not receive it. This applies particularly in the sphere of taxation where there have, until recently, been certain concessions regarding the taxation of private companies which applied to UnitedKingdom companies as well as to Indian companies. The Government of india have, in the last eighteen months, taken power to treat United Kingdom private companies as foreign for taxation purposes, but they, are now considering repre-sentations by United Kingdom nationals and by the High Commissioner against this innovation. There are some signs that they may be willing to consider thesefavourably.20. A.further point in favour of the first hypothesis, as against the second,is that the existing safeguards for the preferences, whether for goods or nationals,are expressed in quite general terms in commercial treaties so that it would bepossible for India, so long as these safeguards are preserved in her treaties, togive to other Commonwealth countries all kinds of preferences without risk ofchallenge. But once India ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth, any suchspecial favours would have to be enshrined in formal treaty clauses. In this form,when India had become foreign, they would become much more open to challengeby other foreign countries on most-favoured-nation grounds. Indeed, carefulexploration of this problem at an earlier stage led to the conclusion that the chances of preserving special Commonwealth privileges in a foreign india by means of any formal treaty would be poor, and that unilateral assurances from india, even of an informal kind, would be more likely to give the desired results.21. Finally, it should be noted that any outcome under which the UnitedKingdom had to give Indian goods or nationals less favourable treatment thanthat accorded to Pakistani goods or nationals would give rise to serious practicaldifficulties in maintaining the latter treatment. This consideration again Weighs,from the trade point of view, in favour of the first hypothesis as against the secondor the third.22. Financial. If India remained within the Commonwealth, it is reasonable to assume that she would also remain within the Sterling Area. Therewould then be no tangible change in the financial relations between India and therest of the Commonwealth. Any unwillingness on India&apos;s part to co-operate in financial and economic matters, or to accord favourable treatment to Britishinterests in India (as distinct from her ability under international law and treaty obligations to continue to give them preferential treatment) would result from* causes more or less independent of any constitutional change. But India&apos;scontinuing membership of the Commonwealth might be expected to imply agreater readiness to give full co-operation in financial matters as a member ofthe Sterling Area.IVSecond Hypothesis: That India becomes a foreign State in especially close treatyrelationship with the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries.23. Political. If India left the Commonwealth in the circumstancesenvisaged under this hypothesis, her relations with the United Kingdom and other commonwealth countries, and the extent to which other Commonwealth Govern-ments could continue to exercise influence over Indian policy, would then depend largely on the nature of the treaty relationships which could be arrived at. Inthe process of negotiating such treaties, India herself might come to realise more readily where her interests lay, while Commonwealth countries would hope toestablish in the new relationship adequate provision not only for the preservation-tion but for the strengthening of existing ties. By these means relations with india might in practice become easier than they are under the Commonwealthsystem, where rights and obligations are undefined and are left to the good senseand good feelings of the different Governments. From the particular point ofview of the United Kingdom, it could no longer be held that there was anymoral obligation upon the United Kingdom to come to the assistance of Indiaif threatened by aggression, while India recognised no such reciprocal obligation.24. The foreign policy of Commonwealth Governments might also benefit from the fact that India, no longer in a position to exert pressure by the realor implied threat of leaving the Commonwealth, would have no pretext for
invoking Commonwealth assistance in any policy which was designed solely tofurther Indian interests. All Commonwealth countries would be able to treateach aspect of their relations with India strictly on its merits. Under the stressof world events India might find that the loss of the Commonwealth connectionwas adversely affecting her own position and security, and even her internalstability, and might thereby be led to seek a renewal of Commonwealth supportby offering greater reciprocity than she does at present.25. On the other hand, India&apos;s secession from the Commonwealth wouldhave world-wide repercussions. Judging by the fact that the Soviet Union voted for the admission to the United Nations of Burma, which had left the Common-wealth, while they vetoed the application of Ceylon, which remains a member,it could be expected that India s departure from the Commonwealth would be exploited to the full. Every effort would be made to exaggerate the degree ofthe estrangement and, without the steadying influence of Commonwealth member-ship, India herself might respond. She might then tend to greater intransigencein her handling of international affairs, and show less willingness to consider theinterests of other Commonwealth countries. Foreign countries other than theSoviet Union would have an incentive to establish closer relations with india which might be to the detriment of Commonwealth countries.One of the most serious disadvantages of this course is the situation thatwould arise if India left the Commonwealth and Pakistan remained within it.The political dangers of that situation are obvious. Reference is made elsewhereto its economic and financial difficulties.26. Colonial.-li India became a foreign State, political difficulty would arise in any British Colonial territory in which a substantial majority of theIndian community opted for Indian nationality. Those who so opted would presumably have to be disfranchised, and the creation of alien communitieswithout political rights would aggravate the difficulties to which the Indian com-munities already give rise. Other communities would intensify their attacks upon them, and also upon any Indians who chose to remain British subjects.There might even be demands for the deportation of all persons of Indian origin.No treaty relationship with a foreign India could reduce the bad effects which India&apos;s complete independence would have on the future of constitutional development in Colonial territories. It could not fail to increase the influence of the extreme nationalists in the Colonies, and would correspondingly reducethe influence of the more responsible political leaders who are content that theirpeoples should remain within the Commonwealth.27. Economic. If India became a foreign State, it would be very unlikely,as indicated in paragraph 16 above, that the Commonwealth countries couldpreserve their trade preferences and the privileged position of their tradeconnections in India- Further, it seems highly doubtful whether commonwealth countries could in fact secure by a special treaty with India the assurances ofspecial treatment which they would wish to obtain. Even if these could hesecured, there would be far greater risk of their being successfully challenged by foreign countries under their most-fayoured-nation treaties with India. this applies particularly to the privileges for nationals and companies, though thetrade preferences would also become open to challenge from many countries. Infact, it seems virtually certain that, even under a special treaty, commonwealth interests in India could not receive anything better than most-favoured-nation treatment in any field. The effects of this change, particularly in regard to taxation, might he severe on United Kingdom companies and w;ould substantiallyreduce the invisible earnings which at present assist the United Kingdom&apos;balance of payments with India.28. Financial.-As indicated in paragraph 10 above no special financial problems would be raised if India remained within the Sterling Area as a foreign country in close treaty relationship with the United Kingdom and other Common-wealth countries. Such a treaty relationship might be no less satisfactory thanthe Commonwealth membership as a basis for financial co-operation. Indeed,in one respect it might be even more satisfactory. For if it were at any timedecided that India&apos;s membership of the Sterling Area was more of a liabilitythan an asset, it would be easier to exclude her if she had become a foreign country; it would not then be necessary to take into account the possibility thatsuch exclusion would precipitate her withdrawal from the Commonwealth.&apos;36648 &apos; c
Third Hypothesis: That India becomes a foreign State with no close treatyrelationship with Commonwealth countries29. As stated in paragraph 2 above, it is assumed for the purposes of thishypothesis that India leaves the Commonwealth in a frame of mind which isat the least unco-operative and possibly hostile. The greater part of the existingties of sentiment between India and the Commonwealth are assumed to have been broken, and this could hardly occur without some accompanying bitterness on thepart of India. ,&apos;  - &apos;      ;l    -!::&apos;-- ; &apos; -&apos;-   I--;/;tv; rn&apos;&apos; blnm ::30. Political. In this situation the interests Of the Commonwealth wouldcertainly be prejudiced; and the disadvantages mentioned in paragraph 25 above would be experienced to an even greater extent. It would be difficult for theUnited Kingdom Government, or any other Commonwealth Government, toexercise any effective influence over the policies and attitude of the indian government in international affairs, and India might well embark On a franklyanti-western policy. This in its turn might lead her to fall eventually underCommunist domination; and this, combined with Communist domination of China,might well result in the total extinction of all western influence throughout Asia.31. Colonial. The problems mentioned in paragraph 26 above would beeven more serious if India were, not merely a foreign Power, but a Power un-friendly to the Commonwealth countries and ready to exploit the difficulties inherent in the existence of large Indian communities in these territories. india would, in these circumstances, be unlikely to show any restraint in pursuing herpolicy of opposing &quot; Colonialism.&quot;32. Economic-Yrom the economic angle also, this is the most unfavourableof all the hypotheses. In this situation it would become quite impossible tomaintain trade preferences or special privileges between the commonwealth countries and India. Indeed, from a hostile India it might be difficult to secureeven most-favoured-nation treatment for the future, except perhaps for goods.In such circumstances India would be free to accord to the citizens or companies of the United States or other foreign countries treatment more favourable thanthat accorded to Commonwealth citizens or companies. And she might treatCommonwealth countries less favourably than at present, or than other foreigncountries, in the supply of certain scarce commodities.33. Financial. For reasons of financial self-interest India might wish toremain in the Sterling Area, even though she had severed all friendly relationswith the Commonwealth. In that event, it must be assumed that, thoughremaining within the Sterling Area, she would do nothing to co-operate in itsworking and would be as hostile as she thought it expedient or prudent to be.Her attitude would then be somewhat Similar to that now adopted by Burma;and it would be open to her to adopt the following courses : (i) She might do her utmost to wreck British business interests in India.The necessities of her economic situation might restrain her from anyattempt to confiscate or drive out British capital, at any rate in the short run, but the general atmosphere would deteriorate so much thatBritish interests would tend to withdraw of their own volition from india.(ii) She might try to stop payment of the sterling pensions payable toformer members of the Indian Services. India has bought annuitieswith which to finance these payments, and the United KingdomGovernment would still control the funds from which the pensions are paid. But the civil pensions (which form the smaller part ofthe whole) are paid through the Office of the High Commissioner forIndia in London; and the United Kingdom Government would not have enough information about the individual cases to enable them totake over the administration.(iii) India might go as far as she dared, short of risking expulsion fromthe Sterling Area, in exceeding the agreed net drawings on thecentral reserves of gold and dollars.
(iv) She might do the least she need by way of co-operating in strengthening-the position of sterling, e.g., in helping the working of PaymentsAgreements which establish a basis of payment in sterling. this might cause serious embarrassment.If, however, India indulged to any serious extent in either or both of thetwo latter policies, it would become necessary to expel her from the Sterling Area.34.   If, however, India decided to leave the Sterling Area, by reason of hergeneral hostility to the Commonwealth countries, it would be open to her to takethe following action (in addition to the two courses indicated in sub-paragraphs (i)and (ii) of the preceding paragraph) : -(i) She could demand an exchange guarantee to protect the value of hersterling balances against a possible depreciation of sterling. Such aguarantee would be both embarrassing and harmful to the position of sterling: Egypt&apos;s request for such a guarantee has already been refused.(ii) She would demand a share of the central reserves of gold and dollars;and, in view of her hard-currency deficit (which is now running at separately of  40 millions a year), she would certainly press for a large shareof the reserves. A similar demand from Egypt has already been refused.(iii) She might try to apply dollar invoicing in her trade with the UnitedKingdom and other sterling area countries. This would be wastefuland harmful both to the other sterling area countries and (in view oftheir probable retaliation) to herself; and it seems doubtful whethershe would in fact take this step. For, owing to her lack of the meansof exchange in which to carry on trade and payments on a dollar basis,she would have to offer sterling for most of her purchases and could not therefore do more than make limited demands for dollars for essential commodities, e.g., for jute goods. Secondly, she is at present sub-stantially in deficit (by nearly  40 millions on current account) with the sterling Area and probably could not eliminate this deficit, though she could reduce it, in conditions of economic warfare. She would there-fore become a net loser of dollars if there were dollar invoicing on alarge scale.35. Finally, there would be two substantial disadvantages to the Common-wealth if India left the Sterling Area. First, the exchange control maintained in London would have to bear a very large additional burden in handling the greatvolume of transactions between India and the United Kingdom. Secondly,Pakistan would probably desire to remain in the Sterling Area; and commonwealth countries would be seriously embarrassed if it proved impossible to meet her desirebecause of the defective exchange control between India and Pakistan.VI.Summary36. This analysis shows that the third of the three hypotheses discussed in this paper is from all points of view political, colonial, economic, financial andmilitary the most disadvantageous to Commonwealth countries.Between the first and the second hypotheses there is perhaps less to choose.From the point of view of military interests the important need is that india should be on friendly terms with the Commonwealth countries, and her consti-tutional status is of secondary importance.From the financial point of view, it is desirable that India should remain aco-operative member of the Sterling Area. But it is not essential for this purposethat she should continue a member of the Commonwealth. There is no reason whyshe should not give full financial co-operation within the Sterling Area as a foreign country in close treaty relationship with the Commonwealth countries.36648
Ob more general economic grounds, the first hypothesis is clearly preferable tothe second. The existing preferences, both in trade and in the treatment ofnationals, might be maintained so long as India remained a member of theCommonwealth, even though she severed her connection with the Crown; but it isvery unlikely that they could be preserved if India became a foreign State,however close her treaty relations with the Commonwealth countries.From the point of view of repercussions in the Colonies the first- hypothesisis the least inconvenient.The political considerations are perhaps more nicely balanced as between thefirst and second, hypotheses.37. Thus, whatever view is finally taken of the relative advantages of thefirst and second hypotheses, it is at least clear that it will be of special importance that the negotiations with India should be so conducted as to ensure that, if she has to leave the Commonwealth, she does so in an atmosphere of goodwill andwith intentions conducive to the continuance of a friendly association with thecountries of the Commonwealth.February, 1949.
APPENDIXMILITARY IMPLICATIONS OF INDLAS POSSIBLE FUTURE STATUSAppreciation by the Chiefs of Staff committee we examine below the military implications of three possibilities regardingthe future status of India.  These are : (a) that India remains a member of the Commonwealth, though owing noallegiance to the Crown; or(b) that India becomes a foreign State in a specially close treaty relationship with the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries; or(c) that India becomes a foreign State with no such close treaty relationship.2. From the military point of view the prime necessity is that we shouldhave the friendly co-operation of India in both peace and war. This is obviouslymore likely to be the case under alternatives (a) and (6) above than under (c).Pakistan3. Militarily it is necessary that India and Pakistan should have a common policy for defence against external aggression. The relationship between Indiaand the United Kingdom cannot therefore be considered in isolation. We believethat, irrespective of the policy pursued by India, Pakistan will continue as amember of the Commonwealth, and we have based our paper on this assumption.Strategic Importance of India in War4.   The strategic value of India and Pakistan taken together is (a) India possesses large potential resources of all kinds, including man-po\verand industry, and is thus the only area in South-East Asia capableof supporting a major military effort.(6) Bases in India and Pakistan dominate sea and air communications in theIndian Ocean.(c) Pakistan and India could provide strategic air bases for attacking Russia.Even if India and Pakistan are both friendly to us, we cannot hope to make full use of the above unless they are prepared to afford each other mutual support.Role in war. Should the Soviet Union attack India or Pakistan, the attack would beof purely preventive nature. Such an attack would therefore be unlikely unlessthe Soviet Union were convinced of the Anglo-American intentions of using air bases in India or Pakistan. Owing to the logistic difficulties of land attackevery form of pressure will be used to prevent the use of bases there by the Anglo-American Powers. Should these measures prove unsuccessful, military attacks on India or Pakistan would probably be limited to air attacks. These attackswould necessarily have to be delivered by the Soviet long-range air force at theexpense of high priority air operations in other campaigns. Both India and pakistan would need considerable assistance to meet this threat.6. It is obvious that the Allies&apos; requirements would best be met by a strongIndia in full co-operation with Pakistan as an active ally providing not only thenecessary forces for her own defence but making a contribution outside India.Under these conditions we could make use of the Pakistan and Indian air bases for our strategic air offensive.7. We do not believe, however, that the Allies will, even by 1957, be able tomake any significant contribution to help India in her defence. This fact is certain profoundly to affect India&apos;s defence policy, and may well until such time as she herself raises adequate forces to meet the external threat cause her toadopt an. attitude in war which she appreciates is unlikely to provoke Russiainto attacking her. For instance, under present circumstances we believe itunrealistic to assume that she will permit us to use bases for the strategic air offensive, as this must inevitably force the Russians to take preventive action, nor would she contribute any forces outside India. We believe, however, that shemay grant us the facilities set out below.
Our Requirements in War8. Our requirements are that India should grant us the following facilitieseven though she is not actively engaged in hostilities against Russia: (a) She should make available to our war economy her resources in man-power,industry and raw materials.(&amp;) She should grant us air transit facilities for military aircraft and theright to operate maritime aircraft from the Andamans, Nicobars andLaccadives.(c) She should grant us fuelling and repair facilities for warships.(d) She should allow us transit facilities for Gurkhas.Our Requirements in Peace9. Since India is the most powerful nation in South-East Asia, her effectiveresistance to the spread of communism in her own territory and the lead she can give to other countries in South-East Asia will be a major factor in resistingthe spread of communism, following on recent developments in China.We should also afford India such military assistance as we can to sustainher resistance to communism.10.   Further requirements in peace are : (a) India, in co-operation with Pakistan, should develop her defences, par-tieulaiiy her air forces, so as to ensure the integrity of the Indiansub-continent.(6) We wish to retain our transit rights and staging facilities for military aircraft.(c) India should develop and maintain to the greatest possible extent herindustrial capacity, port, transport, airfield and communicationfacilities.Military Implications of Future Possible Relationships with India11. Our requirements can only be obtained if India will co-operate in peace and in war with the Commonwealth, especially Pakistan. This co-operation is most likely to be attained if India remains in the Commonwealth, or is boundto us by a satisfactory treaty.12. The position of India as a foreign country without close treaty relation-ship with the Commonwealth suggests that India would consider that her interests were not in harmony with those of the Commonwealth, or indeed with those ofthe Western Powers. India cannot develop or maintain her present industrial and war potential without external assistance. It would, therefore, be difficult for her to maintain an independent neutrality and she might tend to align herselfwith Russia and Russian satellites.If this premise is correct the implications would be : (a) We should obtain none of our strategic requirements in India in eitherpeace or war.(6) India&apos;s relations with Pakistan, assuming the latter remains within theCommonwealth, might well worsen, thus weakening the combineddefence of the sub-continent. Pakistani position as a member of theCommonwealth would therefore be gravely threatened.Conclusions13.   We conclude that: (a) Our strategic requirements in India cannot be considered in isolationfrom those in Pakistan. They remain the same whatever the finalrelationship between India and the Commonwealth may be and areas set out in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 above.(b) Our strategic requirements cannot be met unless India is friendly both to the Commonwealth as a whole and to Pakistan.(c) The best way of ensuring this is for India to remain a member of theCommonwealth; failing this she must enter into close treaty relationswith the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries.(d) It is unlikely that our requirements would be met if India became aforeign State with ho close treaty relationship. In fact, there is apossibility that India might then drift towards Russia.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,February, 1949.
