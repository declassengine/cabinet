We now request that formal approval be given to these recommendations.E^B.E.&apos;S.9*A March, 1949.annex report BY THE WORKING PARTYPreambleThe Working Party established under the provisions of CP. (49) 12 dated17th January, 1949 1&apos;. Has considered the action necessary to transfer the responsibility forthe administration of the former Italian Colonies of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania36695
from the War Office to the Foreign Office and has recommended the action tobe taken 2. Has recommended a London establishment suitable for the task whichhas now been approved by the Treasury, has indicated each position in thisestablishment at present authorised and manned in the existing War Officeestablishment and has investigated the availability and willingness of the individuals concerned to transfer to the new body to be formed. It has agreedthat the new London organisation could suitably be entitled &apos;&apos; The Foreign OfficeAdministration of African Territories&quot; (F.O.A.A.T.).3. Has considered the question of responsibility for the future administra-tion of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, while the responsibility for the adminis-tration of these two territories remains with His Majesty&apos;s Government. TheWorking Party has ascertained that (a) If F.O.A.A.T. is required to assume i-esponsibility for the administrationof Cyrenaica and Tripolitania only, it will require an overall establish-ment of 121. If, in addition, F.O.A.A.T. were to be required to assume responsibility for the administration of Eritrea and italian somaliland, an increment of 29 only (all of whom would be of lowerrank than Principal) would have to be added to the above figure.(6) Should the War Office be required to retain responsibility for the adminis-tration of Eritrea and Somalia, only 21 officials (all of junior grade)would be available for transfer to F.O.A.A.T. If the War Office wereto be relieved of all responsibility for the administration of theex-Italian Colonies, some 77 posts* would become redundant.Sixty-one officials (including a large proportion of senior grades)would be available for transfer.(c) Of the existing files and records some 50 per cent, deal with matters4. The Working Party have considered the possibility of the responsibilityfor the future administration of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland being transferredto a civilian department other than the Foreign Office, e.g., the Colonial Office,and are of the opinion that &apos;(a) Although it might well be appropriate for the Colonial Office to assume responsibility for the administration of these two territories in theevent of their remaining the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment permanently or semi-permanently, the assumption of suchresponsibility by the Colonial Office during a purely transitional period would have no advantages.(6) If the Colonial Office were to assume responsibility for the administrationof Eritrea and Somaliland during a purely transitional period, itcould not undertake more than a limited integration of this administra-tion into the normal Colonial Office organisation and would require an addition of eighty to its present establishment.(c) If, however, responsibility for the administration of these territories were passed to the Colonial Office, thus bringing in a third Department,the dangers already feared as the result of divided responsibilitiesbetween the Foreign Office and the War Office at this juncture wouldbe increased.(d) On the other hand, if the responsibility for these two territories were,contrary to expectation, to remain permanently or semi-permanentlywith His Majesty&apos;s Government, the considerations referred to in (a)and (c) above would no longer apply.. 5. If, therefore, the Foreign Office were to undertake responsibility for theadministration of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania only and if responsibility for theadministration of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland were to remain with the WarOffice or be assumed by the Colonial Office, the total man-power commitment forthe London establishment would be approximately 200.   If responsibility for(a) by the War Office, and(6) by the Foreign Office.* Exclusive of typist, stenographer, &amp;c, pools.
the administration of all four territories were assumed by the Foreign Office, the equivalent man-power commitment would be approximately 150.6. The Working Party, bearing in mind the necessity for saving man-power,for avoiding duplication of effort and for ensuring administrative efficiency, andbearing also in mind the fact that any division of existing staff must materiallydelay the establishment of F.G.A.A.T., recommends that responsibility for theadministration of Eritrea and Italian Sbmaliland be undertaken by the ForeignOffice concurrently with their assumption of responsibility for the administration 1of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania.7. The Working Party have considered the date on which the transfershould take place and now recommend that the transfer of responsibility shouldbe effected as from 1st April, 1949.recommendations. That the responsibility for the future administration of Eritrea andItalian Somaliland be transferred from the War Office to the Foreign Office con-currently with the responsibility for the future administration of Cyrenaica andTripolitania.2. That, if responsibility for these two territories were to remain permanentlyor semi-permanently with His Majesty&apos;s Government, the question of depart-mental responsibility for the administration of Eritrea and Somaliland shouldbe reviewed.3:   That the transfer of responsibility referred to in recommendation 1 above should be effected as from 1st April, 1949.4. That the recommendations of the Working Party as to the action to betaken by the War Office and by the Foreign Office should be implemented insufficient time to enable the new London establishment of the Foreign Office^.O.A.A.T.) to commence work by 1st April, 1949.
