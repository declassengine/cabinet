tlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1949 ,      JLSECRET Copy No.CP. (49) 61IQthMarch, 1949CABINETMARRIAGE ALLOWANCE-NATIONAL SERVICE OFFICERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in November last the Minister of Defence announced* the following increases in the pay and marriage allowance of the Armed Forces :-Pay*Other Ranks with higher qualifications or higher rank-increasesranging from 7s. to 10s. Qd. &amp; week.Marriage allowanceOther ranks-increases ranging, according to rank, from 7s. to 11s. aweek.. Officers-under 25 years of age an increase of 11s. a week;25 years of age and over-increases of 42s. a week if not living in married quarters, 21s. a week if occupying married quarters.The announcement said that National Servicemen would be eligible for theother ranks&apos; pay increases when they had completed 12 months&apos; service, but thatthe marriage allowance increases would not apply to National Servicemen.The Minister of Defence (in his memorandum CP. (49) 43) agrees that the marriage allowance increases should not be extended to National Service other ranks. But he considers that the omission from the Parliamentary Statement ofany specific reference to National Service Officers will have been taken to imply that such officers are to receive the increases in marriage allowance; further, that ifthe marriage allowance increases are withheld from National Service Officers theGovernment will be exposed to a charge of bad faith. I see no adequate grounds for taking this view. The omission of any reference to National Service officers was deliberate, because no agreement had been reached on the point at the time.The terms of the announcement were designed specifically to leave the positionunprejudiced pending further discussion, and in the meantime it was agreed thatthe marriage allowance increases should not be paid to National Service Officers.The announcement said that marriage allowance increases would not apply to national Servicemen. These men. whether serving as other ranks or as officers,form a characteristic and identifiable class. Although in the Armed Forces thereis a distinction, mainly on disciplinary grounds, between officers and other ranks,all National Servicemen, whether other ranks or commissioned, are subject to thesame compulsion of service and are required to serve for the same period. It maybe mentioned that over three months have now elapsed since the marriage allowance increases were put into effect, and, although, they have not been^extended to National Service Officers, no serious complaintt has arisen. This^would seem to indicate that the exclusion of National Service Officers from theImarriage allowance increases has been generally accepted.* Official Report, 24th November, 1948, column 1250, a copy of which is attached to CP. (49) 43.t A Question has now been put down for Tuesday the 29th March by Mr. Lipson.36704

Further, there is ho adequate dase 6n merits for extending these increases to national Service Officers, i ,The. main object of the recent increases was toencourage recruiting for; regular ipersonnel. The marriage-allowance increases for officers, as? explained in the Parliamentary Statement, were designed to assist themin meeting the exceptional; expenses of Service life, especially, those arising fromthe present abnormal frequency of postings. The most! important of theseexceptional expenses were said to be very high rents, and in some cases boarding-school charges owing to the need to provide continuity of education for children.For National Service Officers the period in the Forces is a short interlude in a normal civilian career1,; and  here Vfiltjbe nq occasion for their fa^i^es,iwhere;^tJleJ^are married, to move house to follpw -Service, postings. Unlike career officers,they do not gear their entire domestic arrangements to continuous service in the armed Forces with its threats of peribdic disturbance. With regard to the extraeducational expenses, it is highly improbable that the young National ServiceOfficer will have children of an age at which continuity of education is of any importance.National Service Grants V &apos; -An important consideration leading to the exclusion of National Servicemenfrom the marriage-allowance ihereases was that a scheme of special allowances(National Service Grants) has been provided for National Servicemen whosenormal pay and allowances in the Forces are insufficient to enable them to meet their civilian commitments. The Minister has offered to exclude National service officers from benefit under this scheme in consideration of their receiving the marriage-allowance increases. In most cases National Service Officers will find it unnecessary to apply for a National Service Grant. But where, such an officer hasexceptional commitments in civil life, e.g., in respect of the maintenance of awidowed mother, it would not   be possible tb satisfy public opinion that it was reasonable to deny him the special assistance provided for those undergoingcompulsory service. And, as the Minister himself recognises, it would in any case be necessary to make special provision for National Service Officers who were awarded a National Service Grant before being promoted to commissioned rank.The Minister&apos;s proposal would thus give the National Service Officer the best of both worlds. .... ,r.Reactions on National Service other ranksThe practical effect of the Minister&apos;s proposal would be that, while refusing to extend tp a married National Service private the marriage-allowance increaseof 7s. a week which has been given- to the regular, we should be giving an increaseof 42s. a week in the marriage allowance bf the National Service subaltern^ Sucha difference of treatment would be politically indefensible: We could have no confidence, moreover, that thfc demands that would arise f6r corresponding increases for National Service other ranks would be confined to marriage allowance. It might well become necessary to give them the recent pay ihereasesas well. This would cost soihe  800,000 a year.National Service DoctorsI recognise that, a,s the Minister points out, a substantial proportion of theNational Service Officers Will be professional men, and in particular doctors, andthat the refusal of the marrlage-allpwance ihereases fPi* the latter may give riseto representations by the British Medical AssbciatiPn. It should be a sufficientanswer to any such representations that doctors, in commoh with ether membersof the community, must be expected to take their share of National Service underthe same conditions as are applicable to National Servicemen generally. Moreover,to the extent to which it may be shown that their remuneration while serving inthe Forces is an inadequate reward for their professional skill, any adjustmentrequired should properly be made to pay, and should hot take the form of a general increase in the marriage allowance of all National Service Officers.SummaryTo sum up, I consider that-(i) We are not committed by the statement of 24th November, 1948, topaying the marriage-allowance increases to National Service Officers.
Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,10th March, 1949.(ii) There is no case on merits for extending these increases t6 Nationaln Service Officers; in particular they are not subject to the specialexpenses which these increases were designed to meet.(iii) To give an increase of 42s. a week in the marriage allowance of theNational Service Officer while refusing an increase of 7s. a week in thev. marriage allowance of the National Service private would be politicallyindefensible.      *     , m.     t  &apos;. : (iv) The Ministers proposal would have reactions which might cost in allsome  800,000 a year. -: For these reasons I ask the Cabinet to agree that the marriage-allowanceincreases announced in November last for officers of the Armed Forces should hoinow be extended to National Service Officers.R.
