They are: (a) Proposal that the Conventions should apply in case of civil war orundeclared war (paragraph 5).(b) Application of the Conventions to irregulars (Partisans) (paragraph 6).\c) Derogations and Intangibility of the Conventions (paragraph 7).\d) Sanctions against War Crimes (paragraph 9).\e) Surrendered Enemy Personnel (paragraph 10).(/) Work permissible for prisoners of war (paragraph 11).(a) Repatriation after hostilities (paragraph 12).(h) Status of &quot; protected personnel &quot; (i.e., medical and chaplains) (para-graph 13).(j) Joint responsibility of transferor and transferee powers (paragraph 14).(k) Substitute for Protecting Power (paragraph 15).(I) Finger-prints (paragraph 16).We recommend approval of the Committee&apos;s recommendations (which were unanimous), except those on Surrendered Enemy Personnel, Work and Finger-prints.   For the reasons given below we advise the Cabinet (a) not to seek to authorise in future wars a category of &quot; Surrendered EnemyPersonnel,&quot; outside the protection of the Prisoner of War Convention;(&amp;) to approve a compromise formula on work, put forward by the Inter-national Red Cross Committee, which was not available to the Inter-departmental Committee;(c) not to refuse agreement to the compulsory use of finger-prints for purposesof identification. *We should point out that the Home Office are not happy about (c) and the interdepartmental Committee (under a Home Office Chairman) on the proposedCivilian Convention take a different view about the application of that convention to civil War, Other questions common to the Civilian and Military Conventionsare mentioned^in paragraph 17 below; but, except on civil war and finger-prints,the two Committees are in agreement.36484 b
I Introduction --THE Swiss Government have invited us and other interested Powers to arepresentative Diplomatic conference to open at Geneva on 21st April, 1949,for the purpose of discussing four new Geneva Conventions, viz.: (a) a &quot;Red Cross Convention&quot; for the amelioration of the condition ofthe wounded and sick on battlefields, to replace that signed at geneva on 27th July, 1929;(6) a &quot;Prisoners of War Convention&quot; relating to the treatment ofprisoners of war, to replace that signed at Geneva on 27th July, 1929;(c) a &apos;&apos; Maritime Convention&apos;&apos; to apply the principles of (a) to maritimewarfare and to replace that signed at The Hague on 18th October, 1907\ (10th Hague Convention);(d) a Convention for the protection of civilians in time of war.If this conference reaches agreement on new texts, a second session will beheld a few months later (after Governments have had an opportunity to consider them) to sign the Conventions.2. The substance of the proposed Conventions was examined in April, 1947,by experts from the Allied nations of the Second World War, who met in Genevaat the invitation of the International Red Cross Committee. The results of thismeeting have been examined by two interdepartmental committees set up withthe concurrence of the Foreign Office. The first of these Committees (under aWar Office Chairman) examined (a) and (6) above, remitting the examinationof (c), the Maritime Convention, to a Sub-Committee under an AdmiraltyChairman. The proposed Civilian Convention was examined by a committee under the Chairmanship of the Home Office.The present paper is concerned only with the work of the first Committee,which contained representatives of all Departments of State directly concerned and invited attendance from other Departments less directly concerned.3. The Committee&apos;s report is attached; it covers (a), (6) and (c). its recommendations are unanimous. Copies of the report have been sent informally to the self-governing members of the Commonwealth and to the United States.Part I of the report sketches the background on which these questions arise.Part.-II deals with important questions of policy. The Committee&apos;srecommendations on these questions are to be found in paragraph 221 ofthe report.Part III deals with other important matters as to which the Committeeregard their recommendations as being consistent with the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.Part IV covers matters which the Committee regarded as within thecompetence of official channels to decide.Part V considers briefly the report of the Admiralty Sub-Committee on theproposed Maritime Convention (Appendix B) in so far as the recommendationstherein affect the corresponding provisions of the Red Cross or Prisoners of WarConventions.4. We recommend that the Cabinet should (with the reservations tabledbelow) approve the recommendations of the Committee as a basis upon whichthe representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government should proceed at the conferenceof experts expected to be held this autumn. In the paragraphs which followwe draw the attention of our colleagues to the more important of these recom-mendations and to two specific points on which we feel that the recommendationsof the Committee should not be wholly accepted.Civil War, Colonial Conflicts and Undeclared war. International law governing the conduct of belligerents does not in termsapply to any conflict which is not a recognised war between States. Such conflictsas those between the Chinese and Japanese before the Second World War, theSpanish Civil War, and the hostilities which developed in the countries occupiedby Germany between the German Forces and organised bodies of nationals of
those. countries, have led to a strong movement to secure that the hew geneva convention shall apply in terms to civil war, colonial conflicts and undeclared war.(I) Civil WarThe 1947 Experts&apos; Conference recommended that: &quot; In the case of civil war in any part of the home or colonial territory of a Contracting Party, the principles of the Convention shall be equallyapplied by the said Party, subject to the adverse Party also conformingthereto.&quot; &apos; ,In practice, a Sovereign Power could not be bound to apply the Conventionsif these provisions were included, unless (a) the Sovereign Power itself accepted the existence of a state of war and,in addition,(6) was reasonably satisfied that the insurgents intended and had the powerto carry out the Conventions.It is to be presumed that any British Government would apply the standards of the Conventions to the wounded and sick and prisoners taken from the insur-gents in any conflict which became &quot; war &quot; in any recognised sense of the word.If this is so, the proposed provision would not impose a burdensome obligationupon His Majesty&apos;s Government. Ex-members of the Resistance Movements onthe Continent, many of whom were at the 1947 Experts&apos; Conference, emphasised that it was impossible to secure humane treatment for prisoners captured by the resistance Forces from an occupying force in an occupied country, so long as the occupying Power did not accept obligations to treat members of the ResistanceMovement with humanity.The opposite view has been taken hitherto so far as the Civilian convention is concerned, on the grounds that no Sovereign Government could accept a positionin which it undertook to treat civilians who assisted insurgents otherwise than asrebels and traitors. We do not dissent from this view as an abstract statement of strict legal and constitutional principle, and we recognise that there are differences between organised insurgent forces and the civilian population generally.Nevertheless we suggest that, if a civil conflict ever reached a point at which rebelforces were holding some part of British territory under their control and were taking prisoners from the regular forces, it would be in the interest of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to accept the proposed &quot; civil war &quot; obligation, if by doing so there would be the least chance that they would save the members of the armed forces engaged in the conflict from maltreatment by the rebel forces. There need,in practice, be no question of recognising the rebels de jure in order to bring theprovisions into operation; for some intermediary, such as the International red cross Committee, would probably secure the agreement of each side in terms whichwould be accepted by the other side as representing reciprocity, without any directagreement between the sides. This method of avoiding the problem of recognitionhas&apos; been adopted with some success in the conflict between Arabs and Jews inPalestine.We recommend, therefore, that the Cabinet should accept the recommendationof the Committee on this point, which is set out in paragraph 34 of their report, inso far as the three Conventions (Red Cross, Prisoners of War and MaritimeConventions) are concerned, leaving over the question of the application to the civilian population of the Civilian Convention in time of civil war to be considered when the report of the Home Office Committee comes up for approval. In ouropinion, the obligations should cease with the termination of hostilities.(II) Undeclared WarThe principle of the recommendation of the Committee is acceptable, butit will be necessary in drafting the Article containing the provisions relatingto undeclared war (paragraph 30) to ensure that the Conventions shall becomeapplicable when there is occupation of territory accompanied by hostilities, andnot to any and every case of occupation.   A new draft Article (replacing thefirst and third paragraphs of the Geneva draft Article given in paragraph 30)has been agreed between the War Office and the Foreign Office and reads  (1) &quot; The present Convention shall be applied between the High ContractingParties throughout the duration of war or hostilities, between any twoor more of them, whether such hostilities have or have not been recognised by the parties as constituting a state of war.&quot;
This provision would include a state of Occupation accompanied by hostilitiesand this is clearly the only kind of occupation the Conventions ought to cover. -Partisans6. Outside the question of the whole-time insurgent force in a civil war(referred to in the previous paragraph) there is also the case of the &quot; partisan.&quot;This loose term is used to cover:-(a) irregular combatants,(b) members of a military organisation for resisting an occupying power, and(c) members of the Home Guard or similar organisations, and the countriesoccupied by the Germans during the Second World War have pressed strongly for the protection of the Conventions to be extended to thesecases.The last category mentioned above is included because the crux of the problem is to find a formula which would maintain the principle, hitherto firmly held in international law, that, in war, an individual ihust choose to be either a combatantor a non-combatant, and that he may not claim the rights of protection given bythe laws of war to a combatant, if he is continually changing from one status tothe other. The essential character of the Home Guard (except when called out for permanent service) and of Resistance Movements, as they were known in theSecond World War, is that they continue their civilian occupations when theyare not required for actual operations.Discussions at the 1947 conference failed to produce an agreed solution, butthe Committee have now recommended a solution, set out in detail in paragraph 41of the report, which there is reason to suppose might be acceptable to the &quot; parti-san &quot; countries. The essence of this proposal is that the partisan concerned mustbelong to a force which obeys the laws of war when operating and that his head-quarters are capable of being communicated with and of replying to commuhica-tiOns. The recommended solution would mean, in practice, that it would be forthe sovereign or occupying power concerned to satisfy itself that bodies or in-dividuals of these classes did, in fact, satisfy the conditions. Thus the onus ofproof would be on the partisan.We recommend that the Cabinet should approve this recommendation.Derogations and Intangibility of the Conventions7. There are here two distinct but closely linked problems. The represen-tatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government have maintained the view that the Con-ventions should recognise that special circumstances may arise in which it willhe impossible to carry out the conditions of the Convention in full. Clearly, foodor water supplies for a prisoners of war camp may be; interrupted for a time by heavy bombing. On the other hand, those countries having close experience ofGerman occupation oppose this view, arguing that any &quot;escape &quot; clause ipllfbestretched beyond reasonable limits by an unscrupulous Power, and that it would,therefore, be better to make no allowance for derogations in the Conventions,leaving Powers concerned to defend themselves. after the event by pointing tounavoidable circumstance.Our view is that the Conventions should allow derogations. As a result offurther discussions between the War Office and the Foreign Office agreement hasbeen reached on a draft Article dealing with this question, to be placed at thebeginning of the Convention, reading as follows : -&quot; Derogations from the present Convention shall be permissible only :-&quot; (1) where exceptions to the present Convention are rendered inevitableby the conditions of capture;&apos;&apos; (2) where exceptional circumstances arise which make it impossible,for the time being, to carry out in full all the provisions of thepresent Convention.&quot;Nevertheless, these exceptions shall not infringe the fundamental principles of the present Convention, and shall cease from the time at whichthe circumstances necessitating such exceptions are no longer in being.&quot;We recommend that this Article and the Committee&apos;s views on this matter,given in paragraph 54, be accepted.
Intangibility8. In the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention there is an Article whichallows belligerents to come to mutual agreement on any matter they choose. ThisArticle has been used on occasions to make arrangements which might be regardedas worsening the position of prisoners.* Here again the countries which havehad experience of German occupation are fearful that a provision sanctioningless favourable treatment than the Convention requires would legalise the typeof agreement for which the Vichy and other Quisling Governments were responsible during the Second World War and they, therefore, desire to makethe provisions of the new Conventions intangible by limiting the power to makeagreements to provisions which would improve the treatment provided as aminimum by the Conventions.The view of the Committee, with which we agree, is that this is an imprac-ticable proposition. The Committee argue that some of the provisions of theproposed Convention could only be accepted if some measure of elasticity is retained, as permitted in the 1929 Convention.We recommend that the Committee&apos;s advice, which is contained inparagraphs 60 and 61 of their report, be accepted.War Crimes9. At the 1947 Experts&apos; Conference the United States and the european allies urged that there should be embodied in all the new Conventions an Articleproviding that serious breaches of the Conventions should be regarded as war crimes, and that parties to the Conventions should be required to punish persons responsible as war criminals.The United Kingdom delegation resisted this proposal on the grounds that: (o) humanitarian Conventions were not a suitable medium for warlegislation;(V) any breach of the Conventions would be a war crime, and that to specifysome breaches only would tend to create grounds for claiming thatbreaches other than those specified were not war crimes, with a conse-quent weakening of the whole doctrine of war crimes;(c) international legislation regarding war crimes should be a, separateinstrument and penalties and punishment should have regard to thewhole field of war crimes and not to one particular corner.The Canadian Government take the view that it would be a mistake tointroduce war crimes legislation into the Conventions, and the United States havenow modified their view.We recommend that the Cabinet should approve the recommendations of theCommittee, which are contained in paragraphs 208 to 218 of their report, andshould authorise the United Kingdom delegation to resist any reference to war crimes in the new Conventions.Surrendered Enemy Personnel10. Following the surrenders of Germany and Japan, the United KingdomGovernment were faced with the problem of the treatment of Armed Forcessurrendering en masse. Largely for practical and administrative reasons these forces were not treated as individual prisoners of war, but were retained in their military formations and units under the command of their own officers. this action meant that the United Kingdom Government was not answerable for theirtreatment under the terms of the existing Conventions. In practice, their treat-ment was humane and provoked little criticism, but the United Kingdom hasbeen criticised strongly for having undermined in principle the whole basis ofthe protection of captured persons. In the view of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs it is increasingly difficult to justify this special category ofsurrendered enemy personnel having no rights in international law, and it isnatural that the French and other Governments whose forces were treated inthe same way after the 1940 surrenders desire to prevent the same thing happeningin the future.* e.g. By agreement with the Germans the British Government reduced the pay  of captivemedical personnel.
In their recommendation (paragraphs 44 to 50) the Committee have had regard to the deliberate policy of the United Kingdom Government at the endof the last war and have no doubt felt bound to recommend that provision shouldbe made in any future Convention for surrendered enemy personnel, though such provision could not but give them rights inferior to those of prisoners of warproper. Our feeling is that it would be unwise to accord any formal recognition by international agreement to such a category, and we therefore recommend thatthe recommendations of the Committee on this point (paragraph 50 of the report)should not be approved.Work11.   The 1929 Prisoners of War Convention provides that: &quot; The work done by the prisoners of war shall have no direct connectionwith the operations of the war. In particular, it is forbidden to employprisoners in the manufacture or transport of arms or munitions of any kind,or in the transport of material destined for combatant units.&quot;This Article gave rise to many difficulties in interpretation and there is agreement that its terms should be clarified. In our own case we have used prisoners of war for such operations as mine lifting and bomb disposal and we have regarded thisuse as legitimate, provided that we equipped and trained the prisoners for this work in the same way as we equip and train our own troops, and do not use themin a combat zone.This use of prisoners of war has been generally criticised, and at the 1947Experts Conference the United Kingdom view was opposed by New Zealand andthe United States. The Canadian Inter-Departmental Committee has expressedthe view that the practice is &quot; iniquitous.&quot;The Committee recommend that prisoners of war should be allowed to be-employed on general work in agriculture, forestry and civil engineering&quot;by military forces or on any work not primarily connected with operations against an enemy or the production or handling of weapons or ammunition;but, in any case, not in a zone of active operations.&quot;This formula would permit, for example, the use of prisoners of war on liftingmines laid by our own forces, and we have no doubt that, in making the irrecommendation, the Committee felt bound to provide for the same kind ofemployments as those for which His Majesty&apos;s Government have, in fact, usedprisoners of war.The International Red Cross Committee in their latest draft have suggestedthat: &quot; The work connected with the removal of mines or similar devicesplaced by the prisoners themselves before their capture or by other membersof the forces to which they belong shall, however, be authorised on condition that it is carried out in areas distant from the theatre of militaryoperations . . . .&quot;It seems to us that the position of a victorious commander would be intolerableif the responsibility for clearing all the enemy minefields in the surrenderedcountry were imposed on his own troops, and we therefore recommend that theCabinet should approve the compromise solution recommended by the internation red Cross Committee, which is narrower than that which is recommended by our own Committee. We append the complete Article as now proposed by theInternational Red Cross Committee. We would add that the civil userDepartments and the Ministry of Labour and National Service have agreed tothe I.R.C.C. draft.In this as in other matters, international law is different regarding operations at sea and on land; and the removal of sea mines also presents somewhat differentproblems. We mention the point only because the First Lord of the Admiraltymay want to make it clear that these provisions regarding work should relateonly to the employment of prisoners of war on land and that Article 5 of theVlllth Hague Convention would still govern the clearance of sea mines. that article reads: &quot;At the close of the war .... as regards anchored automatic contactmines laid by one of the belligerents off the coast of the other, their position
must be notified to the other party by the Power which laid them and ea hPower&apos;must proceed with the least possible delay to remove the&apos;mines fnits own waters.&apos;&quot;&apos; V     &apos;&apos; &apos;  &apos;Repatriation-after. Termination of Hostilities12. The 1929 Convention does not impose an absolute obligation to repatriateprisoners of war after the termination of hostilities, though there is such an obligation to repatriate when a peace treaty has been signed. But there seemsto be little room for doubt that the intention of the Convention Was that prisonersof war should be returned to their own country within a reasonable time afterthe termination of hostilities. There have been criticisms of our own performancein this matter, both abroad and at home.The Committee came to the conclusion that there may be many good reasonsfor not returning prisoners of war immediately after- the termination of hostilitiesand that, apart from these practical reasons, it may be contrary to the interestsof the men themselves and of their own country to send them back immediatelyafter hostilities cease. They therefore recommend that there should be someelasticity in these provisions, but that; as a safeguard, where prisoners areretained for any length of time after the termination of hostilities the detaining power should be bound to give specific reasons justifying the retention, not onlyto the prisoners themselves, but also to the protecting Power and to the Inter-national Red Cross Committee.Proposals have been put forward  &apos;     &apos;(a) to prohibit any differentiation in selecting prisoners for repatriationunless based on sex, health, age or length of captivity, ,(6) to prohibit repatriation of prisoners against their own will.We agree with the Committee that both these proposals should be resisted.Had the first been embodied in the present Convention His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould have been prevented from returning prisoners to Germany on thedeliberately selective basis which they, in fact, adopted: The second proposal might saddle a detaining Power with large numbers of prisoners of war who,for various reasons, might prefer to stay in the country where they were detained.We recommend that the Cabinet approve the Committee&apos;s recommendations in paragraphs 87 to 91 of the report.Protected Personnel13. We draw attention to the important change which it is proposed tomake in the status of captured medical personnel and chaplains.Hitherto, under the Geneva Red Cross Convention, all persons engaged inlooking after wounded and sick, or in transporting them, and chaplains, havehad, in theory, immunity from being made prisoners of war and if they fall into the hands of an enemy, that Power is under obligation to send them back totheir own forces &quot;as soon as a route is open.&quot; In practice these provisionshave proved unworkable, and, with some minor exceptions, such personnel havebeen treated as prisoners of war, but those who were surplus to the needs ofthe wounded and sick of their own forces in enemy hands were, after delay,repatriated.- The present position is unsatisfactory because there is no obligation on abelligerent to notify any information about medical personnel and chaplains whoCome into their hands; nor have such persons any rights in disciplinary and legal proceedings, correspondence, relief supplies, &amp;c. It is, therefore, proposedthat, if they fall into the hands of the enemy in future, they should becomeprisoners of war with all the protection which the Prisoners of War Conventionmay give them.We recommend that the Cabinet should endorse the recommendations contained in paragraph 162 of the report.Joint Responsibility of transferor and transferee Powers14. During the Second World War prisoners were frequently transferred from one detaining Power to another. Difficulties arose in fixing responsibilityfor the treatment of such transferred prisoners. At one time certain prisonersheld in fact by the Italians were alleged to belong to the Germans and no remedycould be obtained in matters where their treatment was not satisfactory.  This
affected the Continental countries much more than the British Commonwealth.We ourselves transferred prisoners freely between the members of the Common-wealth and to and from the United States.The 1947 Experts Conference recommended (a) prohibition of the transfer of prisoners to a Power not party, to. theConvention by a party to the Convention;(ft) that where prisoners were transferred from one party to the convention to another, both parties should be jointly responsible for the appli-cation of the Convention.We recommend that we accept (a) without question; but (6) raises difficulties.A similar proposition was examined during the war to govern relationsbetween ourselves and the other members of the Commonwealth, but it provedunacceptable. We are satisfied that it is also impracticable. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government made it a condition of the transferof certain German prisoners from SHAEF to France that we should be jointlyresponsible for their proper treatment by the French; but in practice, neitherwe nor the United States were able to secure any amelioration of their conditionseven when we felt that their treatment by the French was not adequate.A belligerent is unlikely to be in a position to impose effective sanctions on anAlly during a war, and without the power of sanctions it is difficult to see howany Power could in fact discharge the responsibility which it is proposed shouldbe assumed in respect of prisoners transferred by it to another party to theConvention.The Committee recommend that, instead of providing for joint responsibility in the Convention, His Majesty&apos;s Government should press for a clear declaration that a detaining Power ceases to be responsible for the treatment of prisoners from the date it transfers them to another party to the Convention, and werecommend that the Cabinet should approve this.Substitute for Protecting Power15. The effective application of the Prisoners of War Convention dependsin large measure on the existence of a protecting Power, i.e., a neutral whichwatches over the interests of prisoners of war, visiting their camps regularlyand listening to their complaints. When a country surrenders and directrelations are set up between it and its enemies (e.g., the Italian surrender in 1943),or when a Government disappears (e.g., Germany in 1945), the protecting Poweralso disappears. In the interests of the prisoners, and as a result of our experience in the interests of the detaining Power also in maintaining the general discipline and morale of the prisoners, it is desirable that some substitute should, if possible,be found in such circumstances; and there was strong pressure at the 1947Experts&apos; Conference to write into the Convention an obligation on a detaining power to find such a substitute.   This is manifestly absurd.The Committee recommend that a detaining Power in such circumstances should be under obligation to accept any appropriate body which offers itself asa substitute, provided that it fulfils certain conditions set out in paragraph 148of the report. It is particularly important, we think, to ensure that any independent body which assumes the functions of a protecting Power should notbe at liberty to exercise pressure on the detaining Power through Parliament.Press or other internal organs of the country. We advise the Cabinet to approve the recommendations of the Committee in paragraph 148.Finger-prints16. There is a very strong desire that to assist in identification of deadon the battlefield and prisoners of war, all identity documents should carry the holder&apos;s finger-prints: and that the detaining Power should record the finger-prints of each prisoner of war. The Home Office advised the Committee that theuse of finger-prints for non-criminal classes would meet with the strongestresistance from public opinion in the United Kingdom.We already use finger-prints for identification purposes amongst native troopswho cannot write; and we understand that finger-prints were embodied in the identification papers of our own merchant seamen during the war, becausewithout such prints they would not have been able to land in the United States.
The Committee, acting on the Home Office advice, recommend that any provision regarding finger-prints should be permissive and not obligatory. Wethink the Home Office may be exaggerating the strength of-public opinion inthis matter; and from the point of view of establishing identity of membersof the forces falling into enemy hands (and vice versa) we are in favour of accepting the obligation to include finger-prints on identity cards and other documents.17. We have no comments on the other recommendations in the report andwe advise the Cabinet to give general approval to them; but in doing so wewould call attention to the fact that the following questions also arise on theproposed Civilian Convention : &apos;Civil War, Colonial Conflicts and Undeclared War (see paragraph 5above).Derogations and Intangibility (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above).War Crimes (see paragraph 9 above).Joint Responsibility (see paragraph 14 above).Substitute for Protecting Power (see paragraph 15 above).Safety Localities.Finger-prints on identity documents (see paragraph 16 above).e. B...-.. e. s. :10th March, 1949.appendix draft Article regarding Work authorised to be done by Prisoners of WarBesides work done in connection with camp administration, installation ormaintenance, prisoners of war may only be obliged to do work included in thefollowing classes of economic activity: (a) Industries connected with production, extraction of raw material ormanufacture, with the exception of iron and steel, machinery and chemical industries, and of public works and buildings which have amilitary character or purpose.(6) Transport and handling of stores having neither military character norpurpose.(c) Commercial business, and arts and crafts.id) Domestic service.(e) Public utility services having no military character or purpose.

Meetings.   The Committee has had 20 meetings and I attach at Appendix Pa list of the members and the meetings .they have attended.   The Ministry ofDefence, represented by Commander Harper, Joined my Committee at its eighthmeeting, and Commander Harper has watohed oombined Services interests inthese questions.   I have not attempted to bring every Article of the red cross and Prisoners of War Conventions before the Committee:   that wouldhave meant many more meetings;   but the Committee have considered all questions of principle arising on the Conventions, and those detailswhere the answer was not reasonably obvious.   On all the Conventions anumber of questions arise whioh&apos;impinge on military operations, tacticsand strategy and I have tried to indicate these in the Report:   and &apos;Brigadier J.R.C. Hamilton, Deputy Director of Military Operations (a) has agreed that he will arrange for their submission to the Chiefs of Staff on receiving a copy of this Report.i?.     The Committee set up the following Sub-Committees and Working Parties:-(a) Drafting Sub-Committee(b) Maritime Convention Sub-Committee - see Appendix B for Report(o)   Partisans Sub-Committee - see Appendix 0 for Report(d) Working Party on technical aspects of the financial provisions(excluding compensation)(e) Working Party on teohnioal aspects of compensation provisionssee Appendix   for Report(f) Working Party on medioal conditions necessary to qualify for repatriation(g) Sub-Committee on the Treatment of tfomen - see Appendix D forReport(h) Working Party on disciplinary and judicial provisions.The membership of the Sub-Committees and Working Parties is set out inAppendix G.   The substance of the Reports of the Working Parties which arenot included as Appendices to this Report, raise no material points whiohare not oovered in this Report.6.     Existing International Law.   The present International Law on thequestions dealt with by my Committee is to be found, for. the most part, in three International Conventions, viz:-(a) that for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded andSick of Armies in the Field, signed at Geneva on 27th July,1929(b) that relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, signed atGeneva on 27th July, 1929(o)   that for the adaptation of the principles of&quot;the geneva convention to Maritime Warfare, signed at the Hague on18th October, 1907 (10th Hague Convention).7,     The second of the Conventions mentioned in paragraph 6 is much longer than either of the others, each of whioh is to some extent dependent on it;and, except in paragraphs 9 and 10 below, the Prisoners of War convention is therefore dealt with first, throughout this Report.8.     Except on certain specifitf points (see paragraphs 444 to 449 below)the Maritime Convention, whioh it is proposed should take the place of the relevant Articles of the 10th Hague Convention, does not touch the laws ofland warfarej   and it was therefore considered, by a Sub-Committee, forwhich the Admiralty accepted responsibility.   My Committee has concerneditself only with those recommendations from that Sub-Committee which touction matters dealt with in one or both of the 3929 Geneva Conventions:    the
other recommendations of the Sub-Ctoinmittee have, nevertheless, been formallyapproved by the Committee. *9,    Red Gross Convention.   The 1929 Red Cross Convention is the latestdevelopment of the original Geneva Convention of 1964, which was concerned primarily with the protection of. the wounded and sick (and also the dead) onthe field of battle.   It was replaced by a.later Geneva Convention of 1906and this again was superseded by the I929 Convention.   The Red Cross Convention;however, remains in many important respects related to a conception of war as it was in&quot; the middle of the 19th century.   Then Armies marched towards one another, engaged in set battles, in whioh one or other was victorious,&apos;and-separated again for a -times   medical services ^attached to arjuies were farfrom adequate to care for wounded and .sick  during or after a battle, and-assistanoe from the local civil population was therefore invaluable and -mostnecessary;   and jib was praotibable to send baok to their own forces, probablywithin a day or two but oertainly within a very short tim, medical personnelfalling into the hands of an enemy during battle. &quot; $10.   The big. wars of the 20th century produce very different conditions, andit is not surprising, therefore, that some of the fundamental conceptions ofthe Red Cross Convention are now out-moded.   radical changes in this convention are therefore recommended. .11.   Prisoners of War Convention.   The 1929 Geneva prisoners of War Conventionrepresented a considerable advance on the previous International Law on thesubject which was contained in 17 Articles of the Regulations respecting laws and Customs of War on Land which were annexed to the Hague Convention of13th October, 1907.   In passing it may be mentioned that the 17 Articles ofthe Hague Regulations which concern prisoners of war, included three(Articles 10, 11, 12) dealing with Parole, whioh are still the only provision on this subject which was not dealt with in* the 1929 Convention.   With certain exceptions, -the 1929 Convention stood the test of experience in the SecondYforld War in Europe to a remarkable degree. &quot; -12.   Though the Convention undoubtedly influenced the treatment of british prisoners of war in Japanese hands, to,some extent, it was not fully tested inthe Far East.   Though signed by Japan in 1929* it was not ratified by that-oountry^   but it was accepted after war broke out in 1941* mutatis mutandis -a phrase which might have meant anything in the Japanese mind.   To theJapanese mind nil prisoners of war are ipso facto dishonoured.   My Committeehave had particularly in mind throughout their deliberations the need for avoiding provisions, which though appropriate to Europe, might have an unfortunate application for British prisoners of war in Eastern countries.13.   Process of Revision.   Before the end of the Second World War, theInternational Red Gross Committee was collecting and collating information from all quarters;,  and this information, and the International Red Crosscomiiittee^s conclusions thereon, were discussed by them with representativesof National Red Cross Societies, of Religious Organisations and of WelfareBodies.   The International Red Cross Committee then invited certain Powers tosend Experts to a Conference to consider revision of the Conventions;   and government Experts from the following PowersUnited Kingdom India NetherlandsAustralia China NorwayCanada Brazil Czeoho-SlovakiaNew Zealand Belgium PolandSouth Africa France &quot; United States.assembled at Geneva for 14 days in April 1947 for this purpose.14.   This Conference was invited to consider also:-(a) a new Maritime Convention oh lines parallel to the Geneva red cross Convention, to take the place of the 10th Hague Convention;(b) a new Convention for the protection of civilians in time of wax&apos;.15.   Maritime Convention.   The Maritime Convention, being concerned withnaval warfare, is primarily for the Admiralty, but it has important aspects
from the point of view of the other Service Departments and the Ministryof Transport, as well as for the Foreign Office.   The changes in warfareat sea&apos;, consequent on the development of submarines and aircraft, andthe experience of two World Wars,, have revealed the provisions of the10th Hague Convention as relating to a conception of naval warfareinadequate in modern conditions;   and radical changes are overdue.   Theopportunity to secure a new Convention is therefore welcomed by boththe Admiralty and.the Foreign Office.16.   Civilian Convention.   A Convention for the protection of civilians in time of &quot;war was under discussion before the Second World Mar;   -and a rough (and brief) draft Convention was prepared by the International BedCross Committee (the Tokyo draft).   Events during the Second World War,   &apos;not only greatly intensified the demand for such a Convention, but alsowidened its proposed scope.17.   It falls into two divisions, viz:- *(a) protection of enemy aliens, whether interned or not, inbelligerent territory;(b) protection of civil populations generally, during invasion(or attack) and occupation by an enemy.18.   The proposed Civilian Convention has been considered by an Inter-departmental Committee, of which Mr. H.A. Strutt, Home&apos;Office, isChairman, through two Working Parties, the first, under Home Officeauspices,- considering (a) of paragraph 17 above, and the other, under war Off ice auspices, with Brigadier J.F. Benoy, Deputy Director ofCivil Affairs, as Chairman, which has considered the protection to begiven to civil populations in occupied territories. .19.   Brigadier E.K. Page, Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, has reserved on both Interdepartmental Committees, as well as on both working parties of the Civilian Committee;   and I have also attended the HomeOffice meetings, from time to time, when they were considering matters which might have repercussions on prisoners of war.20.   I have mentioned the proposed Civilian Convention here, because some Powers are pressing strongly for one large Convention, with a preliminary part dealing with matters oommdn to the four proposedConventions, and separate parts dealing with/military wounded and sickon land, prisoners of war, wounded, sick and shipwrecked at sea, and civilians;   and on some of the general questions referred to in thisReport, it will be necessary to have regard to the position under theproposed Civilian Convention in reaching decisions on the recommendationsof my Committee.    (See paragraphs 219, 220 and 452 below).21.   Future Action.   At the time of writing it seems probable that another International Conference of Government Experts will be summonedin the late summer or autumn of this year to examine revised draftConventions prepared by the International Red Cross Committee as aresult of the recommendations which emerged from the 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts in the light of the further study ofthose recommendations by the Governments&apos; concerned.   The United Statesof America and France, in particular, are strongly in favour of anotherpreliminary Experts Conference;   and it would undoubtedly serve a useful purpose, particularly in relation to the proposed Civilian Convention.22.    If reasonably firm agreement were revealed at this Second Conferenceof Experts, it may be anticipated that an International Conference ofplenipotentiaries would meet in 1949 to finalise and sign texts for.newConventions.23.   Position of the International Red Cross Committee and Swiss Government.Here it may be helpful to recall briefly that the International Red cross committee is an independent body of Swiss citizens answerable to no oneelse for their actions.   They have established for themselves a uniqueposition in the world by following an attitude of strict neutrality asbetween adverse Powers, coupled with a patient pursuit, which refuses toaccept &quot;No&quot; for an answer, of the humanitarian purposes which are their&quot;raison d&apos;etre&quot;.   The First Red Cross Convention (1864) was inspired by
the founders of the International Red Gross Committee, and drafts prepared .by the Committee have been the basis of discussion by the International     1 JConferences at which the later Conventions were adopted. &quot; &quot;24.   After the first World War, the International Red Cross Committeeprepared the material, not only for a revision of the 1906 Geneva Red CrossConvention, but also for a new Prisoners of War Convention (see paragraph 11above);   and the 1929 Geneva Prisoners of War and Red Cross Conventionseventually emerged.25.   The International Red Cross Committee are, of oourse, not signatories of either of the Conventions which are international treaties to which onlySovereign States are parties.   The International Conference, which adoptedthem, net on the invitation of the Swiss Government and, apart from&apos;secret-arial staff provided by,the International Committee,- consisted exclusivelyof representatives of Governments;   and it is the Swiss Government whichreceived the ratifications of&quot; the Conventions, and is the guardian of them.The International Red Cross Committee sometimes claims that they have the function of watching that the Conventions are implemented;   but this hastruth only in a &quot;persuasive&quot; sense, and the Government of the United kingdom has given no recognition to this or any other claim by the InternationalHed Cross Committee to exercise quasi-political funotions.26.   The initiative in summoning an International Conference of pleni-potentiaries to adopt.revised Prisoners of War and Red Cross Conventions,rests, therefore, with the Swiss Government.   The Netherlands Government,as custodian of the Hague Conventions, has indicated that it would have noobjeotion to the Swiss Government also taking the initiative in revising the 10th Hague (Maritime) Convention.27.   The purpose of preliminary Conferences of Government Experts assembledat the invitation of the International Red Cross Committee is to assist that committee to produce draft Conventions likely to be acceptable to Governments,with a view to submitting suoh drafts to the Swiss Government as a basis ofdiscussion at an International Conference of plenipotentiaries, to bearranged by the Swiss Government, if and when it is satisfied that the time is ripe.28.   It should be added that the latest revised draft Conventions preparedby the International Red Cross Committee will be before the XVIIthInternational Red Cross Conference to be held at Stockholm in August next;but as this will be only 0&quot;e 0^ many items&quot; to be dealt with in a 10-dayConference, it may be anticipated that no substantial modifications willbe suggested at that Conference.PART II - QUESTIONS OP POLICY29.   In this part of the Report I deal with questions of major policy onwhich, in my view, it is desirable that any United Kingdom delegation toa future International Conference should have clear directions.   Throughoutthe Report the recommendations of my Committee are side-lined.30.   Civil War and Undeclared State of War.   The 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts revealed a strong body of opinion in favour of a newArticle in the following terms:-&quot;The present Convention is applicable between the ContractingParties, from the outbreak of any armed conflict, whether thelatter is or is not recognised as a state of war by the partiesoonoerned.in case of civil war, in any part of the home or colonial territory of a Contracting Party, the principles of the convention shall be equally applied by the said Party, subject to the adverse Party also conforming thereto.The Convention is equally applicable to oases of occupation.of territories in the absence of any state of war.&quot;31.   My Committee agree with the recommendation of the 1947 GenevaOonferenoe of Government Experts that, in the circumstances described in thefirst and third paragraphs of the new Article referred to in paragraph 30
j abovethe Prisoners of War and Red Gross Conventions should apply if thpowers concerned are parties thereto, to persons covered by Artiole 1 of the Prisoners of War Convention.. (C.R.G.C./l (48)ll, Item 84)32.   The proposal that the Conventions should also apply in the case ofCivil War, on condition of reciprocity, was oarefully examined by my committee.   We were advised by the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office that J&quot;As war is an armed contention between.States; ... a &quot;civil war1need not be war from the beginning, nor become war at ail, in the-technical sense of the term.   But it may-become war through the recognition of-each of the contending parties, or, of the. insurgentsas a belligerent Power.   Through suoh recognition a body of &apos;individuals receive an international position,; in so far-as it is fwlsome parts, and in,some points, treated as though it were a subjeotof International Law&quot;.    (Oppenheim International Law (6th Edition),,Volume II, page 175).&quot;When the parties in rebellion occupy and hold in a hostilemanner a certain portion of territory;   have declared their independence;   have oast off their allegiance;have organised armisj!have commenced hostilities against, their former sovereign, the world&apos;acknowledges them as belligerents and the contest a war&quot;.    (Hyde -International Law, Volume III, page 1698).*&quot;(Annex to C.R.G. C./Js (47)3).33.   The effect of the advice&apos;.,quoted in paragraph 3^by a Sovereign Power that a state; Of civil war exists in its territorydepends on that Power being satisfied that the conditions set out are fulfilled.   My Committee has no doubt that, in the event of a state of oiviljwar being recognised, by the United Kingdom Government as existing in any territory under United Kingdom Sovereignty, the &quot;principles of the conventions&quot; would, in fact, be applied by that Government to the.insurgent forces.   To accept the proposed provision would, insuchcircumstances, impose no new burden on any Government of the UnitedKingdom, and the condition of reciprocity might set as a safeguard to members of the United Kingdom forces falling into the hands of the^^;insurgents.   .34.   My Committee therefore r-ecomaend.    ^(a) acceptance of the reoommexidation ofthe ^1947 ^nevaConference of Government  xperts that&quot;In the case of oivil war-in any part of the home oroolonial territoryof1 a Contracting Party the principlesof the Convention shall be equally applied by the saidParty, subject :&apos;to.; &quot;Hie.. adverse&apos; Party sJ^,..oonfowningthereto&quot;; /(b) that if other delegations to a future International Goaferanospress for the deletion of the words &quot;the principles of&quot;,from the formula in (a) above, the United Kingdom delegation should not oppose;(o)   that, if the question of wording be re-opened at a future international Conference, the United Kingdom delegation should resist any tightening of wording whioh might COB^ela lawful Government, against its will, to apply the-  Convention;(d)   that, if the above recommendations are approved, the .Treasury Solicitor should be asked to advise on their effect,if adopted in new Conventions, on the law of the UnitedKingdom. (c.R.G.C./M(48)&apos;l!, Item 87).:J5.   The reoommendation in paragraph 34(d) above was agreed oh theof the representative of the Security Service, who also expressed the vxthat there ought to be some safeguard against unjustifiablo pressure rorthe Conventions to be applied to- a domestic situation in such a way asprevent a United Kingdom Government from applying the normal common lawand/or the Treachery Act.   To this end he thought it would be better
some definite oondition were laid down in this provision in the Conventions,e.g. that the lawful Govermaent shall have granted belligerent rights orsought them for itself. 6.    -36.   The remaining members of the Committee, reinforced by the advice of therepresentative of the Legal Department of the Foreign Office, felt that circumstances uaght arise where the proposed provision regarding civil war(see paragraph 34(.a) above; oould be brought into effect by de facto consentsgiven to a third ^arty (e.g. the International Red Cross Coa^tteeTwithout- the lawful Government having to give any formal recognition   as belligerentsto the insurgents. .   . ^*(See also paragraphs 37 to 41 below regarding application of the conventions to irregular combatants)037.   Should Partisans be oovered by the Prisoners of War and Red CrossConventions?   The persons to be covered by the Prisoners of War and red cross Conventions are considered in Part III (paragraphs 225 to 229below),except in the case of &quot;Partisans&quot;.   At the 1947.Geneva Conference of GovemmenExperts there was. strong pressure from delegations representing countriesoooupied during the Second World War to give the full protection of the prisoners of War and Red Cross Conventions to members of &quot;resistance&quot; movementor, as they were oalled at the Conference, &quot;Partisans&quot;.   My Committee use this term broadly to cover(a) irregular combatants;(b) members of a.military organisation to resist an occupying power;and (o)   members of a Home Guard or similar organisation.We include the Home Guard because it consisted of persons who were part-timesoldiers and part-time civilians, and&apos; it would therefore be difficult to claim them as &quot;military&quot; unless the principle referred to in paragraph 40below be modified.38r   The question proved insoluble at the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts.   Mr. H.J. Phillimore (one of the War Office represent-atives) put forward the following formula to govern the recognition of&quot;Partisans&quot;:-(a)   where individuals in an oocupied territory form a military organisation to resist an Oooupying Power; .(b). and gain effective, albeit temporary, oontrol of a region;(o)   then provided that the individual members of such an organisation:-* (i)   are led by a person responsible for his subordinates;(ii)   habitually and consistently display a fixeddistinctive sign recognisable at a distance;(iii)   carry arms openly;   and(iv)   provided that they comply with the rules of war andtreat those members, of the Oooupying Power captured by them in accordance with the principles of theConvention;(d)   it is the opinion of the nations that members of suchorganisations captured by the Oooupying Power should receivesimilar treatment.(0. R. G. C. /P (47) 3, paragraph 3 )39.   The conditions set out in paragraph 38 (a), (o) and (d) above,received general approval but the Conference was almost evenly dividedabout (b).   The &quot;Partisan&quot; countries pointed out all the difficulties inherent in this obntext, and it &quot;was emphasised that the Occupying power would almost always be able to gain control of the lines of communication of a given region and would therefore be in a position to deny that
&apos;&quot;Partisans&quot; controlled that particular area.   There is no doubt that thecase for some recognition of these part-time irregulars will be pressed by the delegations from those countries occupied by the enemy during theSeoond World War;   and it would be difficult for the United kingdom delegation to resist this pressure in view of:-(a) the claim made that the Home Guard, if oaptured, were partof the Armed Forces and entitled to be treated as-prisonersof war;(b) the proclamation by General Eisenhower claiming that theFrench Resistance Forces were acting under his command andwere entitled, if captured, to-be treated as prisoners of war.40.   On the other hand, it would be dangerous to give unlimited recognition to any organised armed body, whatever the circumstances;   and in particular it is desirable for the protection of our own Armed Forces to maintain,so far as practicable, the principle hitherto recognised by InternationalLaw that an enemy population is divided into two classes:-(a) the Armed Forces;(b) the peaceful population and that&quot;It is one of the purposes of the laws of war to ensure that an individual must definitely choose to belong to one class or theother, and shall not be permitted to enjoy the privileges ofboth;   in particular, that an individual shall not be allowedto kill or wound members of the Army of the opposed nation and,subsequently, if oaptured or in danger of-life, to pretend tobe a peaceful citizen&quot;   (Manual of Military Law, chapter XIV,paragraph 17).41. After weighing all these considerations, my Committee approve therecommendation of their Sub-Conanittee that, subject to the approval oftb.6&apos; Chiefs of Staff, the United Kingdom delegation should propose that&quot;Partisans&quot; should be protected by the Prisoners of War Convention, ifoaptured: -(a)   whilst operating in any territory whioh is:-(i) part of the territory of another belligerent whileaotive hostilities continue in another part of that territory;(ii)   territory of another belligerent when that belligerentcontinues aotive hostilities outside that territory;(iii)   territory of another belligerent when, active hostil-ities with the original Allies of that.belligerentcontinue on or outside the territory of that belli-gerent even though the belligerent itself may havecapitulated;(iv) * territory oooupied without the agreement of anindigenous Government, but without aotive hostil-*. - ities; : ..&apos; &apos; *(v)   territory occupied in the faoe of hostilities, but without the declaration of war;(vi)   territory held by each side during a civil war (see paragraphs 32 to 36 above);(b)   whilst belonging to a force:-(i)   whioh had&apos; informed the Oocupying Power of the distinctive sign to be worn by its members (see(c)(ii) below);(ii) which has deolared its existence to the enemy;-  a -
(iii)   whose headquarters have effective control of all thelower formations and units;(iv)   whose headquarters are capable of being oommunioatedwith effectively and of replying to communications;(v)   whioh complies with the rules of war and treatsmembers, of the Armed Forces of the Oocupying Powercaptured by them in accordance with the Prisonersof War Convention;   and(o)   individually and at all times whilst operating as &quot;Partisans&quot;(i)   are oommanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;(ii) display a fixed distinctive sign recognisable at a distance and of whioh the Oooupying Power has been previously informed (see (b)(i) above);(iii)   oarry arms openly;-(iv)   comply with the rules of war and treat members ofthe Armed Foroes of the Oooupying Power captured bythem in accordance with the Prisoners of war convention;and that it should&quot;firmly resist any attempt to widtfn this definition,and should avoid any wording whiah might enable the protection of the prisoners of War Convention to be claimed for:-(d)   persons using armed force who do not wear a recognisablei uniform or oarry arms openly;(o;   spies and the like;( )   persons attacking regular troops treaoherously or under conditions where the troops have no reason to apprehendhostilities and take reasonable precautions to defend themselves;(g) persons who take subversive action against a legallyconstituted government unless such subversive actionbeoomes a state of civil war (see paragraphs 32 to 36above);(h) a person who uses arms against ocoupying forces entirely on his own individual initiative;(3)   bodies who do not conform to the rules and usages ofwar and of the Prisoners of War Convention.(0. K. G. C. M (48) 4, Item 3 2)42.   This recommendation would, I think, be accepted by the &quot;Partisan&quot;countries judging from the views they expressed at the 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts.   It substitutes for the conditionof &quot;being in control of a region&quot; in the Phillimore formula (seeparagraph 38(b) above) the conditions set out in paragraph 41(b)(i)to (iv) above.   A oopy of the Report of the Sub-Committee on Partisansis at Appendix C.43.   It will be observed from paragraph 354   below that uy committee recommend approval for the recommendation Of the 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts that the Red Cross Convention should in futureapply to the same classes of persons, as would be entitled to theprotection of the Prisoners of War Convention if captured.44.   Surrendered Enemy Personnel.   The International Red Cross Committeehave not disguised their view that the oreation of the category knownas &quot;surrendered enemy personnel&quot; was a retrograde step underlining thewhole Prisoners of War Convention;    and their desire to prevent similar
action in future by strengthening the Convention so that it would aoolvnot only to personnel &quot;captured&quot; but to all &quot;who fall into enemyhandSwas shared, at the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts/b^the &apos;delegations from the oountries occupied by the Germans during theSecond World War.&apos; It may be recalled that Germany took somewhat similar action, in principle, in relation to the surrendered french army in 1940.   It is fair to add that it was tacitly admitted at Genevathat treatment of Surrendered Enemy Personnel by the United kingdom was always satisfactory;   the position was very different in the case i;of those who surrendered to the Germans.45.   My Committee were advised by the Foreign Office that they had found it increasingly difficult to refute the persistent arguments advanced by the International Bed Cross. Committee in support of theview that it was not proper to escape from the obligations of theConvention in this way;   and that, if the Committee felt that the category of Surrendered Enemy Personnel must be preserved, it would bedesirable to provide specifically for suoh in the Prisoners of war convention.46.   Having carefully considered the matter at some length, my Committeeare convinced that the acceptance of surrenders on the scale experienced in 1945 would impose on military Commanders and victorious Powers,obligations impossible of fulfilment, if the Prisoners of War Conventionhad to be applied in full to all the personnel surrendering;   nor indeed &apos;would it be equitable that^a Commander of a victorious army should haveimposed on him such obligations, towards large numbers of surrenderedenemies, as could be fulfilled perhaps only by imposing much lowerstandards on his own forces and/or on the local oivilian population.47.   My Committee have necessarily examined this question largely inthe light of what is desirable from the point of view of a UnitedKingdom military Commander faced with large soale surrenders of enemy forces;   but they have not lost sight of the fact that whateverprovisions may be inserted in the Prisoners of War Convention, may atsome future date, affect British personnel.   The definition ofsurrendered enemy personnel recommended by them could have been appliedto the British surrenders at Dunkirk and Singapore, etc.   We have,therefore, considered whether it would be possible to fix a periodbeyond which surrendered enemy forces should not be treated assurrendered enemy personnel but should be converted into prisoners ofwar;   but my Committee have reluctantly come to the conclusion thatthe conditions following mass surrenders are such that it would not bepossible, in advance, to fix any time limit beyond which surrenderedpersonnel would not be retained in this new category.48.   The text suggested to implement my Committee&apos;3 recommendations(see C.E.G.C./P(48)56) endeavours to secure that the standards of food,clothing, medical treatment and accommodation are brought up to the standards laid down in the Convention for prisoners of war as rapidly as may be possible;   but if provisions on the lines of this text areultimately adopted by an International Conference, it would still bepossible for an unscrupulous enemy to avoid fulfilling the obligations of the Prisoners of War Convention for much longer periods than areneoeasary, without being guilty of a breach of the letter of the Convention.49,   From the point of view of large scale surrenders of British foroesinto enemy hands the oreation of this new catergory of surrendered eneuypersonnel with formal recognition in International Law, cannot be described as anything but dangerous and my Committee desire to P^Mfthis faot on record.   They have, however, felt bound to recommend, theoreation of suoh a category in view of the policy deliberately adoptedby the United Kingdom Government and its Allies in relation to theGerman and Japanese surrenders in the Second World War, and or weconsidex-ations whioh led to that policy being adopted.,50.   My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom ^gatic^ to a future International. Conference should press for provisions^ be[embodied in any future Prisoners of War Convention to the effect that.(a)   those who have surrendered in W ^f^tSular^of a general cessation of hostilities in a pamiouxc^
theatre of operations, and who, as a condition of theirsurrender, continue to be organised administratively asunits and formations of their own forces under the orders of their own officers, shall be &quot;Surrendered Enemy Personnel&quot;and not ^Prisoners of War&quot;; V(b)   individuals may at any time, and in the discretion of the detaining; military Commander, be removed from category of-&quot;Surrendered Enemy Personnel&quot; and made &quot;Prisoners of War&quot;;but that, in no oiroumstanoes, could any &quot;Prisoner of War&quot;become &quot;Surrendered Enemy Personnel&quot;;   (note:   after thetermination of hostilities in the Seoond World War, theAllies interchanged individuals between the two categories- at -will); , . .(o)   subject to the will of the Commander to whom he had- surrendered, the Commander of &quot;surrendered enemy personnel&quot;should be responsible for the disoipline and: maintenanceof his forces, and to this end he should be under an-     obligation to use all resouroes available to him;(d).   if the resources available to the surrendered Commanderproved insufficient.to provide adequate food, accommodation,medical treatment, recreational and educational facilities,etc, the Commander of the forces to whom he surrenderedshould, so far as was practicable having regard to his other commitments, supplement those resources sufficiently toenable progress to be made towards the standards laid down for prisoners of war in. these matters;(e)   administration of the surrendered forces, including pay,working conditions,^ discipline, notifications to next-of-kin,documentation, etc., should be dealt with under their ownregulations, the Commander to whom surrender is made givingsuoh external assistance (e.g. facilities for correspondence,etc.) as might be practicable. o.&apos;^(W)8, Item 62)51.   Derogations^ from the Convention.   She 1929 Prisoners of War Conventionallows exceptions (French V derogation) such &quot;as the conditions of suohcapture render inevitable&quot;&apos;in the case of all prisoners of war captured&quot;in the course of operations, of maritime or aerial.war&quot; but theseexceptions must not infringe &quot;the fundamental principles&quot; of the convention and must cease as soon as the captured persons-reach a prisoners of warcamp.   It was generally recognised at the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts that^ in practice, derogations from the full standards of treatment laid down in the Convention were inevitable;-(a) as a general rule, in the period immediately followingcapture, which, in the case of large numbers being oaptured,might be a lengthy period;(b) at any time during captivity where exceptional circumstancesarise, e.g. heavy bombardment might prevent the arrival ofsupplies at camps or might break the supply pipes for water.52.   Nevertheless there was very strong resistance to any proposal to insert in the Convention itself authority to derogate from its letter;and this came largely from the countries which had experienced german occupation.   They took the line that any provision which included an exceptional clause or such phrase as &quot;so far as possible&quot;, would inevitably be quoted by an unscrupulous Power as authority for notapplying the Convention in full.   This group of delegations argued thatif the Convention itself did not recognise any exceptions,, then the detaining Power which was forced by circumstances to make exceptionswould be obliged to furnish proof of the impossibility of carrying ou.the obligations of the Convention in those respects where it haddeparted from them.53.   In these ciroumstances the 1947 Conference did not agree upon anychange in the terms of the 1929 Convention in this matter.j 54.   My Committee recommend that &quot;derogations&quot; as allowed by the 1929
Prisoners of War Convention (see paragraph 51 above) should be authorisedW any future Convention in the case of land warfare as well as maritimeor aerial warfare;   and that the derogations should not be limited to thetime immediately following oapture and before arrival at a prisoners ofwar oamp but should also apply to other exceptional times when it was impracticable to maintain the Convention standards. (q.R.G.C/.L(47)3, Jtff  2)55.   Intangibility.   The view was strongly pressed at the 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts, by the delegations from the countries-oooupied by Germany during the Second World War that the provisions ofthe Prisoners of War Convention should be absolutely &quot;intangible&quot; byagreements between Governments, or by terms of surrender or armistioe;exoept where suoh agreements etc. had the effect of not worsening theconditions of the prisoners of war.   It was particularly emphasised that this &quot;intangibility&quot; should oontinue until the oomplete and finalliberation of prisoners of war;   and it was direoted also against the transformation of prisoners of war into some other category e.g.&quot;Surrendered Enemy Personnel&quot; (see paragraphs 44 - 50 above).56.   This view was approved by a large majority at the 1947 Conferenceand they reoommenaed that Artiole 83 of the I929 Prisoners of war convention should read&quot;The High Contracting Parties reserve the- right to concludeparticular&apos;Conventions on all questions relating to prisonersof war,&apos; concerning which it may appear desirable to make special provision.   Such Conventions shall in no oircumstanoesreduce the standard of treatment for prisoners of war, asregulated by the present Convention&quot;.   (G.R.G.C./P(47) 1, page 117).57.   The United Kingdom delegation at the 1947 Conference resisted thisrecommendation on the grounds that(a) to seek to limit the rights of Sovereign States to concludespecial agreements regarding the. treatment of their own-nationals, would be to risk frequent violations of thisprovision;(b) it Would often be difficult to know whether a particularagreement would work out favourably to the prisoners ofwar concerned or not.As an example of (b), if the Convention laid down a minimum number of letters a prisoner of war should be allowed to write (as many delegationsdesire), and, for censorship or transport reasons it became impossiblefor two adverse belligerents to dispose of so.many letters regularly,would an agreement to reduce the number of letters be permitted?   Itmight be better for the prisoners of war to write one letter eaoh amonth, with an assurance that it would be. despatched, than to be ableto write three, none of which might, owing to congestion, be despatchedfor several months.58.   The Foreign Office Legal Adviser advised my Committee that thefundamental principles of the Prisoners of War Convention should beregarded as part of the Law of Nations, from which particular Nationswere not at liberty to agree to depant, without the oonsent of all parties to the Convention;   but that there would be no objection inprinciple, to modifications of other provisions by agreement between two adverse Powers (C.R.G.C./k(47)3, Item 22).59.   The difficulty in securing agreement at an International Conferenceon the basis of the advioe in paragraph 58 above, would be the absenceof any oommon understanding of what constitute &quot;the fundamental principles&quot; of the Prisoners of War Convention.   Nevertheless, anagreement at an International Conference is unlikely, unless some compromise oan be reached between the views set out in paragraphs 55and 57 above.aO.    My Committee therefore recommend that the United kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should seek agreement on a basis whioh would allow the maximum liberty to belligerents tomodify as they think fit by mutual agreement, the provisions or mo
Convention provided that the fundamental requirements of decent treatmentfair trial, proper punishment and ultimate repatriation are not infringedin any way.  (0.R.&amp;.0./te(48)12, Item 91)61.   My Committee further recommend that the fundamental rights referred: to in paragraph 60 above should include;-(a) Articles 2, 3 and 4;(b) prohibition of work direotjy connected with operations against an enemy or the production or handling of weapons -or munitions/or in any zone of active operations;.(o)   the conditions governing the use of prisoners of war onunhealthy or dangerous work;(d) the prohibition of work contrary to the religious beliefsof .a prisoner of war;(e) essential provisions regarding fair trial and permissiblepunishments;(f) the absolute right to ultimate repatriation provided thatbelligerents should be free by mutual agreement todetermine when and under what conditions such repatriationshould take place.      (G.R.G.c./k(4S)l2, Item 91)   -62.   Work.   Two major questions arose regarding the kind of work on whichprisoners of war might Be used.   The 1929 Prisoners of War Conventionprohibits use of prisoners of war:-(a) on unhealthy or dangerous work (Article 32);(b) on any work&apos; having any direct connection with the operations of the waTjand particularly the manufacture or transportof arms or munitions of any kind, or the transport of. material for combatant units (Article 31).-.63.   These provisions gave difficulty in most countries during the second world War and, in consequence, to many varied interpretations.   Therewas general agreement at the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Expertsthat they needed amendment;   but complete agreement on new provisionswas not reached.64.   With regard to paragraph 62(a) the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts recommended permitting employment, on unhealthy or dangerous work, provided that the prisoners of -war are given the same treatment in respect of accommodation, food, clothing, the same equipment and training as well, etc. as those, applicable to Nationals of the detaining Power (and of course, not less favoux&apos;able than the conditionsgenerally applicable to prisoners of war).   The.existing Article has given rise to protests by prisoners of war against employment on suchtasks as the removal of debris, the cleaning out of dirty ditches, removalof manure heaps, etc.65.   The 1947 Conference also recommended the prohibition of employmentof prisoners of war on work, whioh if performed by a soldier of the detaining Power would be regarded as degrading.66.   My Committee&quot;recommend acceptance of the recommendations of the1947 Geneva Conference, of Government Experts described in paragi&apos;aphs 64and 65 above (J. R. G. C. /i.i(40) 7, Item 50).67.   The difficulties arose on the provisions referred to in paragraph 6*.(tabove.   This question is almost certain to give rise to difficultdiscussions in any- future &quot;International Conference.   The representativesof countries which were occupied during the war will almost certainlypress for a very restrictive definition, whilst the United atatea maypress for an elastic definition which would, nevertheless, excludeany work with the Services though not for the Services.    The basisrecommended by my Committee (see paragraph 71 below) is an attempt tosteer between these conflicting&apos; views and, if it is approved, as e broadstatement of the United kingdom attitude, there is ground for hope that
a future International Conference may agreo on a formula not substantiallvdifferent from it. ^68.   It was generally agreed at the 1947 Conference that it would be inoonfliot with the honourable status of prisoners of war that they shouldbe compelled to do work designed to bring direct harm to their own country;   but the use of prisoners of war on work not affecting theirown country, directly or adversely, Could be defended on the ground thatthe exissenoe of prisoners of war imposes oertain positive handicaps ona Detaining Power (e.g. in the provision of guards, food, clothing,accommodation, etc);   and that it is, therefore, reasonable.than, so faras possible, a-Detaining Power should be able to use prisoners of wario make good the cost of their keep. . The possibility or producing anArticle which would oategorise either the types of work which could be permitted or the types of work to be prohibited was explored at greatlength at the 1947 Geneva Conference;   but, apart from the difficultiesof deciding the category of particular forms of work, the difficulty &quot;of detailed definition.in terms which would have substantially the same ^meaning-in all countries, seems insuperable. &apos;69.   ihe real stumbling block was, however, the desire of the Unitedt Kingdom delegation to-keep the right to employ prisoners of war on suchtasks as mine-liiting and bomb-disposal;   whilst preserving and, ifpossible,, strengthening the prohibition against work having a directconnection with war-operations,&apos; or the production or use of weapons of war.70.   &apos;i&apos;he civil user departments in the United Kingdom would be contentfor prisoners of war to be limited to agriculture, forestry, and civil engineering ^as labourers) but a definition on these lines would rule out .most employments by-the service. Departments.   The United states delegation at the 1947 Conference took the view that, as praotioallyall work in total war had a direot connection with the war, it was essential, in any caue, to revise the 1929 wording.   Informal contacts with the United States have since produced a hew suggestion from themin the following.terms:-&quot;Prisoners of war may be employed in all those occupationswhich are normally necessary for. the  feeding, sheltering,clothing and health of human beings, even, though such work   .may be performed for, or result in, benefits to.the membersof the Military iistablishuient.   A prisoner of war shouldnot be employed in work which is otherwise of value inassisting the conduct of aotive belligerent operations&quot;.Tc.B.G.C./p(48)36)My Committee regard this wording&apos;to. be objectionably vague because   ,&quot;occupations which are normally for..........human beings&quot; mightoover almost anything or nothing.   It would seem to exclude theuse of prisoners of war on such tasks (which all would agree arelegitimate) as road making and land drainage, or in Prisoners of WarInformation Bureaux.71.   My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to an    -international Conference should propose that prisoners of war beallowed to be employed: *-(a)   on agriculture, forestry and oivil engineering;and (b)   by military forces on, any work not directly connectedwith operations against an enemy or the production,or handling of weapons or ammunition;but (c)   in any case, not in a zone of aotive operations. ;.. -v(C.K.G.C./M(48)7, Item 49).72.   Joint Responsibility for Transferred Prisoners of War.   At the1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts, two proposals were made regarding the transfer of prisoners of war from one Detaining Powerto another;(a)   that such transfers to a Power not adhering to the prisoners of afar Convention should be prohibited;
(b)   that, in the event of a transfer to another Party to the A10Prisoners of War Convention, the two Powers should be&quot;jointly responsible&quot; that the Convention was observed in respect of suoh prisoners of war.73.   The proposal in paragraph 72(a) above was unanimously approved by.the 1547 Conference and my Commit 1;ee recommend that the United Kingdom(delegation to a future International Conference should support it; thoughit should be pointed :out that it might create difficulties if UnitedKingdom forces were operating with forces of a Power, whioh was not a party to the Convention, in oiroumstanoes where oaptured personnel oould &apos;be evacuated only to that. Ally.   (C.R.G.C./M(48)ll, Item 86)74.   The proposal in paragraph 72(b) above was supported by the majorityof the delegations at the 1947 Conference, including that from the UnitedStates.   The main argument was that a Party to the Convention, havingoaptured prisoners of war, should not be able to escape from its obligations towards them under the Convention, by hnnfl-ing them over toanother Power.75.&apos; This problem faced the British Commonwealth of Nations during theSecond World War, and experience then showed haw difficult it was for a power which had transferred prisoners of war to another Power, to exercise any control over their treatment.   There would, as a general rule; be no effective sanction which the first Detaining Power oould apply to thesecond, if treatment by the latter did not satisfy the former.76.   This was illustrated, in practice, when after the termination ofhostilities in the Second World War, certain German prisoners of war were transferred by the supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Foroe (in north-Zest Europe) to France, en conditions whioh practically amounted tothe United States and the United Kingdom being jointly responsible with france for them.   Though their; treatment, in some respects, fell below that whioh the United StatesVtod?1fhe&apos; United Kingdom regarded as right, no effective action to improve it materially proved possible.77.   moreover, prisoners of war may be transferred more than once, and the complications whioh would arise if three or more Powers were jointlyresponsible for the same prisoners of war need no description;   to-say nothing of the difficulty whioh would arise, where, in a particular campwhere complaints arose, there were prisoners of war for whioh the Powerconcerned was solely responsible, and others, for whom it was jointlyresponsible with one or more other Powers. &apos;7o.   My Committee came to the conclusion that it would be wrong to aooeptresponsibility in oiroumstanoes where the United Kingdom Government wouldhave no effective means of discharging it;   but that at a future international conference a merely negative attitude would not be likely to receive support.79.   They were also advised by the &quot;representative of the Legal Departmentof the Foreign Office that if the Prisoners of War Convention remainedsilent on this point, it might be difficult in a future war for a UnitedKingdom Government to maintain that it had no further responsibility for prisoners of war transferred by it to another Power.bO.   For these reasons my Committee recommend that the United kingdom delegation to a future International Conference(a) should oppose any proposal to embody in the Prisoners of war convention any provision making a Power transferring prisonersof war to another signatory to the Convention, jointly responsiblewith the new Detaining Power for observing the Convention inrelation to such prisoners of war;(b) should propose the inclusion in the Prisoners of war convention of a provision specifically relieving a &quot;capturing&quot;Power of responsibility, from the date of transfer, forthe treatment of prisoners of war transferred to anothersignatory to the Convention.(C.R.G.a./M(48)ll, Item 86)
81.   Transfer of prisoners of war if &quot;fighting front&quot; approaches theircamp.   The 1947 Geneva Gonferenae of Government Experts recommendedthat the Prisoners of War Convention should provide that &quot;when thecombat zone draws near a aamp, the prisoners of way may be moved only under normal conditions of security, or if their own safety demands&quot;(o.R.G.C./p(47)l, page 78).82.   During the later stages of the Second World War, movements ofprisoners of war often took place under conditions of hardship and at short notioe, because the Detaining Power wanted to prevent their liberation by the advancing foroes of the Power in whose forces the prisoners had served or of its Allies.   The object of the recommendationreferred to in paragraph 81 above (the word &quot;security.&apos;&apos; is not used inits technical sense) is to prohibit that kind of movement and to allowmovements of prisoners of war designed to keep them from liberation only(a)   if they can be carried out under normal conditionsinvolving no serious risk to the prisoners themselves;or (b)   if removal is necessary to take them out of exposure to:  danger (e.g. from bombardment).83*   My Committee recommend the proposal referred to in paragraph 81above should be brought to the notioe of the Chiefs of Staff, and, subjectto no adverse advice from - them, the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should support the recommendation that, in theevent of the combat zone approaching a prisoners of war oamp, the prisonerstherein should be moved only(a)   under normal humane conditions and if they can be movedunder reasonably safe conditions;or (b)   if the move is necessary in the interests of their own safety.(C.R.ft.C./k(48)9, Item 64).84.   Repatriation on termination of hostilities.   There was strong pressureat the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts in favour of strength-ening the provisions of the Prisoners of War Convention to ensure that prisoners of war are not held by a Detaining Power for long periods after all hostilities with their own country have ceased.   The argument runsthat prisoners of war are detained only to prevent them continuingaotively in the fight and that there is, therefore, no justification for continuing to hold them once the. fighting with their country has ended.In particular, objection was taken to the insertion in armistice orsurrender terms of provisions postponing the repatriation of the prisoners of war.85o   The United Kingdom delegation at the 1947 Conference argued, onthe other hand, that it is impossible to foresee the conditions in whichhostilities will cease and it may be that the Condition (e.g. devastation)of their home country, or the need for olearing up war damage in thecountry of the Detaining Power, or the economic or security conditionsin their own country, might be suoh that it would be unfair, and perhap seven disastrous, for the whole of the prisoners of war in enemy handsto be repatriated at once to a defeated country.86.   My Committee gave careful consideration to the arguments on bothsides and were persuaded that some concession must be made to the pressure to strengthen the Article (Article 75).   There is little doubt -that its authors in 1929 intended that prisoners of war should bessspatriated within a reasonable time after hostilities ended, thoughthe wording they chose does not require this absolutely until a peace treaty has been concluded.187.   My Committee recommend that:-(a) the Article should provide that prisoners of war will be repatriated as soon as possible after the conclusion ofhostilities unless there are adequate reasons to thecontrary;(b) the kind of reasons justifying delay should be illustrated,
eeg. military or economic conditions in their own country or tb* oanaItion of the country of the Detaining Power;(oj   where prisoners are retained, the reasons should be explairsflflto fcbsm,1 to the Protecting Power and to the internation red Cross Committee;(d)   any prisoners still detained when a peace treaty is signedshould be immediately returned to their own oountry, Unlessthat treaty should include specific provisions to theoontrary.    (C. R.G,.C./M(48)2, Item 15) ,68.   The International Red Cross Committee favour the prohibition of differences of treatment in selection for repatriation other than thosebased on sex, health or age;   and also of the repatriation of any prisonersof war against their own will.89.   The first of the proposals referred to in paragraph 88 above, would prevent such selective repatriation as took place, as deliberate policy,after the Second florid War, in which prisoners of war, regarded assympathetic to the democratic way of life, were given priority.90.   With regard to the second proposal referred to in paragraph 88 above,the United Kingdom delegation at the 1947 Conference pointed out firmlythat it would be most unfair to a Detaining Power to have to keep a prisoner of war who did not want to go back to his own oountry.   Theproposal to prohibit-repatriation of prisoners of war against their willderives from the attitude adopted by some Governments towards oertainrepatriated prisoners of war;   and it may be re-opened at a future Inter-national Conference.   The question has wide political implications, andit is therefore desirable that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should have clear instructions on this issue, andthat, if possible, those instructions should have been approved on high level.    (see also paragraph 333 below).91.   toy Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should firmly oppose the proposals referred toin paragraph 68 above.    (C. R. G.C./M(46)l2, Item 93).92.   Treatment of women.   The application of the Conventions to women wasconsidered by a Sub-Committee ou which each of the Services&apos; Nursing Servioesand ,Vomen&apos;s Services were represented and this Sub-Committee satisfied themselves that the proposed provisions of the Conventions were adequate,except on Certain points of detail, which are dealt with in Part III(paragraphs 298, 354 and 383 below);   but they called attention to thenecessity for ensuring:-va)   that all members of these Services should, in war-time, beclothed in distinctive uniform and wear badges;(b)   that notification to the adverse belligerents of the ranks,titles, uniforms and badges of these Servioes should be madeas in the oase of male forces;and that the necessary machinery to ensure that these things-were done,should be made ready in peaae.   These points were emphasised because Militaryilurses captured in liongrKong and Singapore had great difficulty in establishing their military identity and status to the satisfaction of theJapanese.   Canadian Military Curses, who were in military uniform, wearingbadges similar to those worn by the Canadian Army Medical Corps, had no suchdifficulty.    The Report of the Sub-Committee on the Treatment of women isat Appendix D. ,53&apos;   Parole.   As mentioned in paragraph 11 above there is no reference to thegrant of Parole to prisoners of war in the 1929 Prisoners of .V&apos;ar Convention;and the provisions of Articles 10, 11 and 12 of the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of v/ar on Land annexed to the Hague Convention of16th Uctober, 1907, are as follows:-&quot;10.   Prisoners of ./ar may be set at liberty on parole if the laws of their country allow it, and, in such oases, they are bound, on their personal honour, scrupulously to fulfil,
both towards their own Government, and the Government by jjhiohthey were made prisoners, the engagements they may haveoontraoted.-      . .     . &apos;In suoh oases their own Government is bound neither to requireof nor aooept from them any servioe incompatible with theparole given.11. A prisoner of war cannot be compelled to accept his libertyon parole;   similarly the hostile Government is not obliged to accede to the request of a prisoner to be set at liberty onparole.12. Prisoners of war liberated on parole and recaptured bearingarms against the Government to whioh they had pledged theirhonour, or against the allies of that Government, forfeittheir right to be treated as prisoners of war, and may be puton trial before the Courts.&quot;  (Manual of Military Law, 1929,page 376)94.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts reoommended&quot;that liberty on parole should be explicitly foreseen in theConvention,........ .not as a general measure but as optionaland justifiable in oertain individual cases.&quot;(G;it.G.C./T(47)l, page 66).As this recommendation does not propose any material change in the existing international Law on the subject, and the admission of Parole would remain entirely optional for the two Governments concerned and for the prisoner of war I have not bothered my Committee with it;   but I bring it to notice here. &quot;95.   I propose to discuss with the Legal Department of the Foreign office the extent to whioh the whole of the subject matter quoted in paragraph 93above from the Hague Regulations should be embodied in the Prisoners ofWar Convention.96.   Disciplinary and Judicial Proceedings.   There are 22 Articles inthe 1929 Prisoners of War Convention (Articles 45-66) dealing with the disciplinary and Judicial treatment of prisoners of war;   and in Part iii of this Report (paragraphs 294-329   below) will be found the recommend-ations of my Committee for clarifying and expanding these Articles in&quot;the light of experience.   At the 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts these Articles were considered by a special Sub-Committee, onwhioh the United Kingdom was represented by Mr. H.J. Phillimore(formerly A.A.G., P.W.2, War Offioe and later one of the prosecuting.Counsel at the Nuremberg War Crimes trial).   The recommendations ofthat Sub-Committee (C.R.G.C./P(47)1, Appendix P) were considered bya Sub-Committee of my Committee, on which were representatives of director of Personal Services, War Office,Director of Prisoners of War, War Offioe,Judge Advocate General, ?Treasury Solicitor.Their detailed report was further examined by my Committee, at ameeting at whioh Mr. Phillimore and the whole of the Sub-Committeewere present;   and the recommendations in this Report represent theconclusions reached by the full Committee with the assent Of themembers of the Sub-Committee.   For this reason I have not consideredif necessary to annexe the Report of the Sub-Committee to this Report.97.   Code of Discipline and Law to be applied.   The 1929 Prisoners OfWar Convention makes prisoners of war &quot;subject to the laws, regulations,and orders in foroe in the armed foroes of the Detaining Power&quot;.   The1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended that thisshould oontinue to be the basis of disciplinary and of judicialproceedings, but that a revised Convention should also provide:-(a)   that prisoners of war should be tried by courts-martial,except where a oivil oourt was the only competenttribunal to deal with the particular offence;
(b)   that special legislation or orders differentiating againstprisoners of war should be admissible only to meetexceptional oiroumstanoes arising from the prisoner&apos;sinternment (see also paragraphs 103 ana Jtfl4    below);(o)   that two principles should be specifically stated inthe Convention, viz:-(i)   that prisoners of war are not nationals of the detaining Power, to which they owe no allegiance ;(ii)   that as members of armed forces prisoners ofwar owe a duty of obedience to the country in whose foroes they were serving at the time ofoapture;(d)   that a Detaining Power may punish a prisoner of war fora penal offence against its laws committed beforeoapture, but the prisoner of war concerned would not.   -        lose his status as a prisoner of war.93.   My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should support the recommendationsreferred to in paragraph 97 above with two modifications, viz:-(a) the omission of the reference to owing no allegiance to the Detaining Power, as it may be that, in some circumstances, a prisoner of war might be held to -owe a limited and local allegiance to the detaining power:   my Committee expressed no opinion on whethera prisoner of war oould, in faot, properly be held to have any such local allegiance;(b) the &quot;law, regulations and orders......of the detaining power&quot; to be applicable only in so far as they do netconflict with the provisions of the Convention or withthe religious faith of a prisoner of war.(C.a.G.C./k(48)lO, Item 70)The reference to &quot;religious faith&quot; is suggested as a safeguard againstsuoh aotion as the German authorities took during the Second World Warin compelling Sikhs to shave their heads in conformity with a Germanprison regulation.99.   Prisoners of War accused of War Grimes.   There was, not surprisingly;strong pressure at the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government iSxpertsto exclude War Criminals from any protection under the Convention.As a principle, no exception oould be taken to this proposal;   butin the view of delegations from some of the countries occupied duringthe Second World War, this exclusion should operate at once for anysuspected war oriminal.   The only modifications which the UnitedKingdom delegation were able to secure are embodied in the followingformula: -&quot;With regard to prisoners of war accused of war orimes:-(i)   prisoners of war should enjoy the benefits of theConvention until a prima facie case is made out against them and they are indioted of war crimes.When prisoners of war lose the benefits of theConvention, the Protecting Power should be informed.(ii)   Prisoners of war indicted of war crimes and thuslosing the benefits of the Convention should be covered by pome international protection based ontreaty stipulations which guarantee them:(a) fair treatment, so that they may be in acondition to plead their case;(b) a fair trial, i.e. a trial whioh providesall those guarantees as to means or defenceafforded by the legal systems of civilisedcountries.&quot;
iOO.    ky Committee are satisfied that there 1b very strong feeling onthis question in many countries and particularly in those occupied duringthe ascend world War;   and for this reason it may not prove poauibleto seoure acceptance, at a future International Conference, of theBritish view that the prisoner of war accused of a war orime should retain his prisoner of war status unless and until he is proved guilty,after a fair trial.   They oonsider that nevertheless a strong effort should be made to establish this view;    but, as this may not suooeed,they have thought it wise to suggest an alternative, which might ultimately: command general agreement as a reasonable compromise.101.     They therefore recommend that the United Kingdom delegation toa future International Conference:-(a) should endeavour to secure that a prisoner of warcharged with a war Crime should enjoy full benefits and protection under the Convention until he has beentried and convicted of the offence, the trial to havebeen conducted in accordance with the terms of theConvention;(b) should seek, if unsuccessful with (a), to preserve fora prisoner of war charged with a War Crime, prisoner of war status, with necessary modifications in treatment;but that, in any case, they should receive adequatefood, clothing, shelter, medical treatment etc., and facilities for preparing their defence and keeping intouch with the Protecting Power.(C.ii.G.C./i..(48)10, Item 67) 5102.     Death Penalty.   The.1929 Prisoners of War Convention requiresan interval of at least three months to elapse between the passingand execution of a sentence of death on a prisoner of war (Article 66).The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts, having regard toexperience during the Second World War, reoommended that this periodbe inoreased to six months, in order co allow adequate time for a full report of the proceedings to reach, through the Protecting Power, thePower in whose foroes the prisoner of war was serving at the time ofcapture, and for any representations from the latter to reach the detaining Power.103.     The 1947 Conference also reoommended that the Prisoners of War ,Convention should prohibit the death penalty being imposed under any legislation or order specially made by a Detaining Power for prisonersof war (see paragraph 97(b) above).104. My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should support the recommendations ofthe 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts:-(a) that the minimum interval between the passing and execution of a sentence Of death on a prisoner of war should be increased to six months; &quot; &apos;(b) that the Detaining Power should be prohibited fromimposing the death penalty under any legislation ororders, special to prisoners of war.(C.R.G.0./Sl(48) 10, Items 70 and 60)105.     Financial Provisions of Prisoners of War Convention.   The 1929Prisoners of War Convention has a number of scattered provisionsregarding the finanoial treatment of prisoners of war by the detaining power, viz: - . &apos; &apos; &quot;&apos;: ;Sums of money taken from a prisoner or war on capture \,.^rticle 6)Pay of Officers (Artiole 23) &apos;state of Exchange to govern officers pay (Article 23)Adjustment between belligerents for offioers pay (Article 23)Officers to pay for food and clothing (Article 22)Expenses of hospital and medical treatment, etc.  urticle 14)Amount of cash allowed to prisoners of war (Article 24)Disposal of foreign currencies belonging to prisoners of war(Article 24)
Disposal of oredit bal&amp;noea (Article 24)Remittances by prisoners of war (Article 24)Remittances to prisoners of war ^Article 33)Basis of payment for wort (Artiole 34)Payment for work done for private individuals (Artiole 28)Compensation for injuries at work (Article 27)Expenses of repatriation or transport to neutral oountry(Artiole 73)Canteen profits (Article 12)106.    Many of these provisions proved unworkable during the second world War;   and others gave rise to criticism.   For example, therequirements that officers should receive the rate of pay applicable totheir rank in the forces of the Detaining Power, or in their own forces,whichever was the lower, and should pay for their food and clothingworked inequitably as between officers in German and Italian hands;and the absence of any provision for advances of pay for other ranksled to difficulties regarding npn commissioned officers in particular.107.     i&apos;he 15*47 Geneva Conference of Government -fcbcperts recommended(a) that all financial provisions in che Prisoners or ifarConvention should be brought together in a specialchapter;(b) that they should be radically altered on lines proposedby the United Kingdom delegation, based generally onthe United Kingdom practice in the Second World War..108.     The recommendation referred to in paragraph 107(b) above maybe summarised as follows(a) the Detaining Power should provide officers, as wellas other ranks, with all necessary maintenance,including food, clothing, medical and hospital treatment and. appliances, etc., free of charge;(b) all prisoners, of war should receive from the detaining power pay at pooket-money rates to be laid down in theConvention;(c) payments&apos; in his own country desired by a prisoner ofwar to be made from his credit balance with the detaining Power, and any such credit balance at thetime of his repatriation or death, to be notified to the Government in whose forces he was serving atthe time of capture for settlement;(d) an aocount to be maintained by the Detaining Power foreach prisoner of war showing all sums due to him orreceived for him and all sums issued to him or paid out on his behalf;   and this account to be accessible to him and to the representatives of the protecting power for inspection;(e) sums taken from a prisoner of war on capture(i)   if in the currency of the Detaining Power, or if converted into that currency at his request,to be credited to his aocount (see (d) above);(ii)   if in any other currency (and not convertedunder (i)) to be treated as personal effectsand returned to him.on repatriation, or, in theevent of his death, to the Power in whose forceshe was serving at the time of capture;(f) rates of working pay to be fixed by the Detaining Powersubjeot to a minimum laid down in the Convention, andnotified to the adverse Powers concerned;(g) compensation for injuries at work or for effects lost
by the action or negligence of the Detaining Power or its agents to be the responsibility of the Power in whose forces the prisoner of war was serving at thetime of capture, except that the Detaining power should be required to replace any such effects requiredfor personal use whilst &amp; prisoner of warj(h)   canteen profits and other communal sums to be credited by the Detaining Power to a Prisoners, Welfare Aooount in each camp, the balances on suchaccounts after all prisoners of war had beenrepatriated to remain in the hands of the detaining power; (see also paragraphs 253 and 254 below);(j)   any adjustment between adverse belligerents in respectof any of these transactions to be a matter for settlement between the belligerents concerned afterthe termination of hostilities.(C.R.G.C/p(47)l, Appendix D)109.     At first sight these arrangements would seem to relieve the detaining Powers of a number of payments for whioh they ought to be liable, but, in practice, in modern war transfers of sums of moneybetween belligerents, and particularly from a defeated to a victorious Power, are rarely practicable;   and any other, principleswould result ill the victorious Power making payments, in its owncurrency, to enemy prisoners of war on repatriation, whilst havingalso to make payment to its own returning prisoners of war in respectof sums due to them from the enemy Government, the latter having no effective means of making payment in any currency of value to thoseprisoners of war.110.     The United States delegation did not accept the recommendationof the 1947 Conference, that oredit balances should be notified tothe Power in whose forces the prisoners of war were serving at thetime of capture, because of a teohnioal requirement under theUnited States Constitution whioh necessitates any balance of workingpay due to a prisoner of war to be paid out by the United Statesauthority concerned.   It may be hoped that this technical difficultywill be overcome.HI.     The recommendations of the 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts were approved, in principle, by my Committee and referred to two Teohnioal Working Parties,(a) to consider all recommendations except those dealingwith compensation;(b) to consider the recommendations regarding compensation.112.     The first of these Working Parties, consisting of represent-atives of the three Service Departments and the Treasury found nomatters for comment, except that of the currency to be used todesoribe, in the Convention, the rates of pay and minimum rate ofworking pay.   On this question the Treasury representative, afterconsultation with the Bank of England, advised my Committee that theawiss (paper) Franc was preferable to the Swiss Gold Franc suggestedby the 1947 Conference;   and my Committee recommend accordingly (seeparagraph 114 below).113.     The second of the Working Parties, referred to in paragraph HIabove consisting of representatives of the Service Departments, theTreasury and the Ministry of Pensions, found no technical&apos;objectionsto the recommendations of the 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts;   but as their Report deals, in some detail, with the mattersconsidered, a copy is annexed at Appendix E.114.     My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should support the recommendationsof the 194/ Geneva Conference of Government Experts regarding thefinancial provisions of the Prisoners of War Convention, except thatthey should seek to substitute, as the currency in which to state
rates of pay and working pay, the Swiss (paper) Franc for the SwissGold Frano. -(0. H. G.

I deal with this subjeotin this part, of my Report, beoause of the close, interest taken bythe public in it in time, of war.   The 1929 Prisoners of War Conventiongives prisoners of war the right to receive &quot;individually&quot; parcels(Artiole 37) and provides for the exemption of &quot;presents and relief in kind&quot; from import and other duties and from railway charges (Artiole 38)and with the censorship of books (Article 39) and parcels (Artiole 40).The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government iixperts concluded that these provisions should be expanded. .116.     The 1947 Conference therefore recommended a new text forArticle 37 as follows:-&quot;Prisoners of war shall be authorised to receive throughpostal or other channels, individually or collectively,parcels containing foodstuffs, clothing, and other artiolesof a recreational, intellectual and devotional character which may promote their oomfort or welfare.   Medicalsupplies shall, as a rule, be sent in collective parcels,subject to the regulations of the home country.&quot;The last sentence is designed to encourage .the addressing of medioalsupplies to Medical Officers or Camp Leaders, whilst not excludingentirely from personal parcels such things as Carters Little LiverPills, the sending of which might give much joy to the folk at home.H7.     &apos;i&apos;he 1947 Conference also recommended that books should not beincluded in parcels of clothing and foodstuffs, in view of the much longer delay in oensorship for paroels containing books.118.     The 1947 Conference^made two further important recommendations about relief supplies, viz:-(a) that any limitation or modification in the applicationof Artiole 37 (see paragraph 116 above) should be thesubject of special agreement between the.belligerentsconcerned;   and such agreements should not &quot;lose sight of the obligations incumbent on the Detaining Power&quot;;(b) that Regulations should be annexed to the prisonersof War Convention setting out in some detail, therightsvof C.*mp Leaders, the Protecting Power and theInternational Red Cross Committee or other inter-national body concerned, in supervising, distributingand controlling relief supplies.119.     The Regulations referred to in paragraph 118 above are considered in paragraphs 284 - 286 below   );   but attention shouldbe called here to three proposals made by the International Red cross committee during the Second World War and again brought forward atthe 1947 Conference which rejected them, viz:-(a)   that clothing despatched for prisoners of war shouldbe distinctively marked (the marking not necessarilyto be normally visible when being worn):   this wouldenable International Red Cross delegates visitingcamps to check misuse, but the administrative,difficulties involved for Ordnance in meeting sucha regulation, render it objeotionable for, during theSecond World War, olothing and underclothing for prisoners of war was despatched in bulk from Armystores:   to mark each article speoially would involvebreaking down bales, marking and then re-baling each
oonsignment as required.   The United kingdom delegation1opposition resulted in defeat of the proposal at the1947 Conference;(b) that the distributors of relief (e,g. the internation red Cross delegates) should have authority in oases of extreme distress, to divert relief intended for prisoners of war of a particular nationality, toother prisoners of war, if the health or lives ofthe latter were endangered;   the United Kingdom,United States and other delegations at the 1947Conference resisted giving any such generalauthority in advance, observing that in suchcirOumstanoes, the delegate oonoerned must act onhis own responsibility and seek concurrence, afterthe event, from the oountry whose relief supplieshe had diverted;   and the 1947 Conference supported this view;(c) that, to prevent prisoners of war from hoardingfoodstuffs, the Camp Leader should have the rightto demand immediate consumption of food parcels:the 1947 Conference rejected this Regulation asdifficult to define and administer, preferring toleave such matters to the discretion of CampLeaders.120.     My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference:- .&apos;(aJ   should support the revised Article 37 Of the Prisonersof War Convention recommended by the 1947 Conference(c. R. g. c. /m(48) 1, Item 5);(b) should support the recommendations of the 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts regarding(i)   limitations of the application of Artiole 37being subject to special agreement(C. it. G. C./M(4S) 1, Item. 5);(ii)   annexing to the Convention, regulationsregarding the supervision, distribution andoontrol of relief supplies (C.R.G.-C./&amp;(48)1,Item 6); (see also paragraph 286 below)(c) should resist the proposals referred to in paragraph 119above (c.R.G.C.&apos;/M(48)l, Item 6).121.     Transport by Land of Relief Supplies for Prisoners of War.   Theonly provisions in the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention coveringcarriage of relief supplies are in Article 38, Viz:-(aj   if postal packets and addressed to individualsthey are exempt-from all postal oharges:   there arecorresponding provisions in the International Postal,and Parcels Conventions - the United Kingdom are partyto the postal, but not to the Paroel Convention:nevertheless during the Second World War theUnited Kingdom applied the provisions of theInternational Paroel Convention to parcelsaddressed to prisoners of war;(b) &apos;relief in kind intended for prisoners of war shallbe exempt from all.........charges for carriage on railways operated by the State:&quot;   in practiceduring the Seoond World War, the United Kingdomapplied this provision as if the words &quot;operated by the State&quot; were omitted.122.     It will be observed from paragraph 121 above that, except forpostal parcels addressed individually, there is no provision regarding
regarding exemption from carriage charges, exoept on &quot;railways operated by the State&quot;,   and during the Second World War the German, Italian andFrench (Vichy; Governments agreed to oarry consignments of collectiverelief supplies free of charge on the railways only after -representations.by the.International Red Cross Committee, they having argued that, into on ^ .the first Paragraph, the second paragraph of Article 39 of the1929 Prisoners of War Convention related only to individually addressedparcels.   These facts are mentioned only to show that the terms of thisArticle laok preoision.123.     The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts accordinglyreoommended that all relief supplies intended for prisoners of war shouldbe carried free of charge:-(a) on railways in any oou.-: ry, belligerent or neutral,party to the Convention;(b) by road transport in the territory of the detaining power.Carriage by road transport outside the territory of the Detaining power should be arranged between the senders and the owners or operators of theroad transport vehicles oonoemed.124.    -The-United States delegation proposed at the 194? Conference that00sts incidental to the movement of &quot;letters, postal oards, bags andparcels addressed to prisoners of war&quot;, other than postal oharges,import and other duties, may be charged &quot;to the Power in whose forces the prisoner *pf war served&quot;, but the Conference rejected this proposal.125.    My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should support the recommendations ofthe 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts regarding responsibilityfor oharges for carriage of relief supplies, intended for prisoners ofwar, by rail or by road, as set out in paragraph 12*3 above.(C.R.G.C./fc(48)l, Item 7)126.    Transport by Sea of Relief Supplies for Prisoners of War.   The1929 Prisoners of War Convention makes no reference to the provision of,or oharges for, sea transport of relief supplies:   no difficulty aroseon this head during the First World War, or in the Second World War until after the occupation of France in 1940.   From the middle of 1940 relief supplies for British prisoners of war were sent under United Kingdomarrangements, to Lisbon, whence it was hoped that onward carriage by railwould operate.   The volume of supplies9 and the consequent delaysrendered the land route from Lisbon completely inadequate, and theGeneral Post Office, in co-operation with the British Red Cross WarOrganisation, the Portuguese Post Office and the International Red cross committee, therefore sought an alternative route.127.     The problem was solved by the hiring by the British Red Cross ofcertain small neutral ships to which, through the good offices of theInternational Red Cross Committee, all the belligerents agreed to givesafe conduct from Lisbon to Marseilles;   and alsp to tihese ships bearing the Red Grose Emrkings *on a white ground.   This was an entirely newprotective use of the Red Cross emblem.128.     Later, a Swiss Foundation for Red Cross Transports was establishedby the International Red Cross Committee, and this Foundation graduallyacquired from belligerents a fleet of ships whioh, marked with the red cross on a white ground, carried relief supplies eto. for prisoners ofwar   under safe conduct from all the belligerents.   The Swiss FoundationZ* noTwelcomed bv the United Kingdom Government and no direct assistance was SvenioTt iTits efforts to acquire shipping;   but the American RedSosf law it strong support and the Foundations ships carried on?rlnsatlantic aTolherbages, Canadian Red Cross   *, well as AmericanReTcross relief supplies for. prisoners of war m Europe.129.     The international Red Cross Committee are eagerto secure^n anyPT -I^^M ^Sonersdevelopment:   and m       -rex^m&quot;*&quot;  tornational Red Cross Committee to*^ *   ll0&quot;
115, the International Red Gross Committee submitted for study, elevenpoints regarding the use of maritime and aerial (see paragraphs 137 and138 below) transport to convey -Relief to prisoners of war and civilian internees of all NationsRed Cross mail and messagesHospital supplies for the wounded and sick of Armies;   and,eventually for civilian war victims, and relief for the civilian population of occupied countries and said&quot;The Committee are very desirous that the basic principles...mentioned should be embodied in a regulation whioh oould beplaced at the end of Article 37&quot;.(of the Prisoners of war convention^The eleven points are set out in detail in C.R.G.C./p(47)35, and my   -Committee13 detailed conclusions on them will be found inC.R.G.G./m(48)1, Item 9:   the general question of sea transport for relief supplies is examined in C.R.G.C./p(47)34.   I have,&apos; therefore,thought it unnecessary to re-examine the whole question in detail inthis Report;   but the United Kingdom delegation to a future Inter-national conference should be given clear directions on the main principles and these I oonsider in paragraphs 130 to 136 below.130.     At the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts, the UnitedStates delegation proposed a new Article in the following terms&quot;To facilitate conveyance of mail and other authorisedarticles sent to prisoners of war, according to Articles 36to 39 the International Committee of the Red Gross, or anyother humanitarian organisation approved by the belligerentsconcerned, shall be requested by the adverse parties signatory to the Convention, to procure the required means of transport(ships or planes), which shall be registered in a neutraloountry, and sail under the flag and the emblem of theInternational Committee of the Red Cross, or of any otherapproved organisation.   These means of transport shall beused for the said purpose by the above organisation, by virtue of safe-conducts whioh belligerents signatory to theConvention undertake to deliver.   These means of transportshall also be available for despatch to consignee oountriesof mail and reports from the Central Prisoner of War Agency,according.to Article 79;   for the despatch to the said Agencyby the information offioe of each belligerent of details and reports concerning the prisoners of war detained;   and, finally,for the despatch to the belligerent concerned of reports andmail&apos; from the Protecting Power, the International Committee of*        the Red Cross or any other approved organisation.   The costs incurred by the use of these means of transport shall beborne proportionately by the belligerents whose nationalsbenefit by suoh facilities?131. &quot; Informal contacts with the Embassy in London have confirmed thatthe United States Government attach great importance to the inclusion,in any future Prisoners of War Convention of specific provisions forthe conveyance by sea of relief supplies for prisoners of war, and forDetaining Powers to accept supplies sent by sea.   The difficultiesduring the beoond World War whioh prevented the shipment of supplies(except on a comparatively small scale at long intervals) for allied prisoners of wsjr in Japanese hands must, in the United States view,be guarded against, so far as is practicable, for the future;   and, intheir view, provisions on the lines of the proposed new Article quoted in paragraph 130 above are the most hopeful way of doing this.132.     My Committee are not convinced that the means suggested would prevent such difficulties as were experienced in the Seoond World War.They recognise, however, that an Article, suoh as that quoted inparagraph 130 above, might have strengthened the hands of the protecting power and the International Red Cross Committee in negotiations on thesubject with the Japanese Government;   though it is doubtful whether
any thing would have persuaded the Japanese military authorities toallow neutral shipping to approach territories controlled by them     4 nnwhilst hostilities continued between the Allies and Japan. 1 Z6133*    My Committee also recalled the vital interest of the UnitedKingdom during two World Wars in the most effective use of all available shipping,, and they were advised that this country would not beprepared to agree jln advance to any plans to set aside shipping for the restricted uses proposed (see paragraphs 129 and 130 above).   In their view such action should be developed only when it became necessary tomeet a factual situation.134.     In a desire to go as far as they considered possible to meet theviews of those who support proposals for recognition of a fleet of red cross ships under the direction of the International Red Gross Committee,or some other neutral body, my Committee recommend: -(a) that no objection should be raised in principle to theprovision of a fleet of Red Cross Transports under thecontrol of a neutral intermediary such as the Inter-national Committee, provided that the United KingdomGovernment was not committed, in advance, to any contribution to or support for such a fleet, and thetransport of relief supplies for prisoners of war was not.limited to such ships;(b) that any provisions for the recognition of a neutral fleet of transports, under the control of the International red cross Committee or other similar organisation for the carriage by sea of relief supplies for prisoners of war,in any future Prisoners of War Convention, should bepermissive and not mandatory;   and should leave anybelligerent complete freedom to adopt any other methodof transport, including, in particular, the charteringby a National Red Cross Society of neutral ships to sailunder safe oonduots;(c) that any proposal to embody in a future Prisoners of war convention provisions regarding the financial responsibilityof belligerents and/or neutral Powers for transport by sea of relief supplies for prisoners of war should be resisted.(C.R.G.C./M(48)1, Item 9)135.     The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended thatthe question of transport by sea of relief supplies for prisoners of war should be referred to a Conference of Government Maritime Experts;   but no action to iiopleiaent this recommendation seems to have been taken,and there is little reason now to expect suoh a Conference to be held.136.     The question of using the Red Cross emblem and flag to mark shipsset aside for the transport of relief supplies, etc. is considered inparagraphs 183 to 185 below.137.    Transport by Air of Relief Supplies for Prisoners of War.   It willbe observed from paragraphs 129 and 130 above, that both the internation red Cross Committee and the United States delegation contemplated the setting aside of aircraft, as well as ships, to be used, under thedirection of the International Red Cross Committee, for the carriage of relief supplies eto. for prisoners of war.   This proposal is open tomany objections.   Belligerents would almost certainly have difficulty in providing aircraft for this purpose because of the heavy demand forair transport for direot war purposes:   presumably any neutral aircraft on regular commercial routes, still in operation, could be used withoutthe need for special arrangements.   Moreover, it is unlikely that suohaircraft would be permitted by belligerents to fly, or guaranteed safeconducts over any territory or sea where operations were, or might be,in progress.    (See also paragraphs 139 to 143 below).138.     My Committee therefore recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Confex-enoe:-(a)   should resist any proposal to provide specifically
in the Prisoners of ,Var Convention for tiie use of air transport for relief supplies, etc. for prisoners of. war;(b)   should, if there is strong pressure from other delegations to make such provision, endeavour to limit it to a broadgeneral statement in very vague permissive terms.(C.R.G.C./k(48)l, Items 8 and 9)(Por use of Red Cross see paragraphs 186 to 189 below)139.     Medical. Airoraft.   Article 18 of the 1929 Red Cross Conventionlaid down conditions under which airoraft, exclusively used for theevaouation of wounded and sick and the transport of medical personnel and material, and bearing the Red Cross emblem, should be immune from attack;   but these provisions proved largely unworkable in the conditionsof modern aerial wari   The use of a Red Cross as a protective sign on medical aircraft can hardly be effective when attack, whether by otherairoraft or from ground troops, is rarely made under conditions of closevisual observation.140.&quot;    The 1947 Conference was almost evenly divided on the question otwhether there was any place for this type of aircraft, in the conditionsof modern war;   but under very strong pressure not to abandon an alreadyrecognised humanitarian principle the Conference eventually agreed torecommend the -recognition, in principle, of the use of medical aircraftmarked with the Red Cross, subject to rigid limitations regarding theconditions of use whioh would guarantee immunity from attack.141.     In the Second World War the United Kingdom used airoraft to evacuate wounded and sick ;   but had no regard to securing immunity from attack for them, preferring to rely upon their own forces to defendthem.    The aircraft concerned were therefore frequently used as military transport aircraft on the forward journey.   There were also instanoesduring the war where German aircraft carrying the Red Cross were proved to be engaged on reconnaissance, including the taking of photographs.There is a further objection to any general use by the United Kingdom of aircraft painted white with the Red Cross;   such aircraft when at reston an airfield, would be readily visible to enemy aircraft and, therefore,would weaken very considerably camouflage precautions on such airfields.142.     Though the United Kingdom is unlikely to want immunity from attackfor exclusively medical airoraft, it would be difficult to secure^ agree-ment on the withdrawal of the recognition of such aircraft in the red cross Convention.   My Committee therefore considered what conditionsof use would, in the employment of such aircraft, prevent abuses by enemy foroes. t143.     My Committee therefore recommend that, subject to the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff, the United Kingdom delegation to a future Inter-national Conference:-(a) should aocept the continued recognition, in principle,of &quot;medioal airoraft&quot;;(b) should insist that &quot;medical aircraft&quot; can be givenimmunity from attack only when flying on routes, atheights and at times, specifically agreed between,allthe belligerents concerned.Cc.R.G.C./M(48)4, Item 33j(For use of Red Cross see paragraphs loo to 189 below;144.     Substitute for Protecting Power.   Experience has shown that effective application of the Prisoners of War Convention may depend onthe activities of a Protecting Power whioh, acting as a neutral &quot;agent&quot;for the Power in whose forces prisoners of war were serving at the timeof oapture, visits those prisoners in their &quot;camps, receives from themcomplaints regarding their treatment, reports regularly to that Power,and makes representations as and when occasion arises, to the detaining power regarding any matters in which it would appear that there is reasonable ground for altering the treatment of prisoners of war.Article 86 of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention provides for oertainfacilities to be given to the Protecting Power;    and there areprovisions in other Articles (e.g. 42,60,62 and 66) whioh depend onthe existence of a Protecting Power if they are to operate at all.145.     During and after the Second World War., Protecting Powers ceased
to function in a number of oases, e.g. for&apos;France, after the . -establishment of direct relations between the French (Viohy) and&quot;&quot;        123German Governments, for Italy, Germany and Japan after their        *    &quot;.&quot;surrenders to the Allies.   So far as the United Kingdom is concerned,an effective Protecting Power for enemy prisoners of war, has oftenremoved difficulties or grievances, whioh might otherwise have oausedtrouble.   That is not to suggest that the Protecting Power acted in theinterests of the Detaining Power;   but the knowledge amongst prisonersof war that there is a recognised authority in the country where they aredetained, who is not an enemy, but to whom complaints and grievances canbe referred, may often prevent that brooding on grievances which canundermine morale and discipline in a camp.146.     It was not surprising, therefore, that there was a general desireat the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts to provide for a substitute for the Protecting Power, when the latter ceases to functionbecause the Government whose interests were being protected, is nolonger in a position to-ask for such protection.   The Conference failed,however, to suggest what the substitute should be.14?.     At first sight it might seem that the International Red cross committee might have filled the gap; but there are two major difficulties,viz: -(aj   the functions of a Protecting Power necessarily include&quot;political&quot; as well as humanitarian actions, and theUnited Kingdom Government has consistently refused torecognise any claim by the International Red cross committee to exercise any political function;(b)   the International Red Cross Committee claims a position-of absolute independence of any other authority;   andthey would not, in any circumstances, accept &quot;instructions&quot;from&quot;the prisoners&apos; &quot;own Government&quot; and might evenchoose to pursue a line not acceptable to that Government.Even if these difficulties could be overcome, it is most unlikely thatthe International -ied Cross Committee would be willing to function in lieu of a Protecting Power. (See also paragraphs 23 and 25 above)148.     My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should be instructed to accept asolution on the following lines(a;       there should be an obligation, albeit ill defined inpractiae, on a Detaining Power to accept a &quot;neutral orindependent organism which was willing to undertake,without charge to that Detaining lower, the functionslaid on a Protecting lower by the Prisoners of war convention provided that the organism concernedsatisfied the Detaining Fower:-(i)    that it was in a position to undertake these .functions;(ii;   that the organism concerned would dischargethem impartially;   &quot; .(iii) that the agents or delegates of the organismconcerned would be persons not objectionableto the Detaining Power;(iv)    that there was no Government representing the prisoners of war concerned in a position to arrangefor their &quot;protection&quot; by a neutral Power;*- (b)    the description of tne &quot;neutral or independent organism&quot;should be sufficiently wide to enable any other government, any recognised international organisation or, in exception circumstances, a national organisationother than one of the nationality of tne Detaining-Power,to be accepteci for the limited purposes of the prisonersof liar oonvention in lieu of a Protecting lower;
(c)   the &quot;neutral or independent organism&quot; would be expected,at all times to- act with a sense of responsibility and in suoh manner as representatives of a protecting power might be expected to act, and as &quot;if acting asagents for the prisoners&apos; &quot;own Government&quot;. .(C.R.G.C./m(48)11, Item 85)The last recommendation is designed to rule out, for example, anyattempt to bring pressure on the Detaining Power through the Press,by questions in Parliament or other similar methods.  &apos;149.     Obligation to publish and teach the Conventions.   Artiole 84of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention require the Detaining Powerto make the text of the Convention available to prisoners of war:Article 27 of the 1929 Red Cross Convention and Article 20 of the -10th Hague Convention (Maritime) each requires signatories to instruct their troops in the provisions of the Convention and tobring them to the notice of the civil population.150.     The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommendedstrengthening the existing provisions on these subjects as follows:-(a) Prisoners of War Convention.Artiole 18 - a new provision making the Camp Commandantresponsible &quot;for the camp guards being familiar withthe Convention.&quot;   (This overlaps the recommendationregarding Article 84 below:   see also paragraphs 258to 260 below)Article 84 - which in the 1929 Convention, providesfor the texts of the Convention and of any special,agreements to be made available to prisoners ofwar, should also require that:-(i)   the Detaining Power shall instruct guards(compare Article 18 above) and personnel ofPrisoner of War Camps in the stipulationsof the Conventions;(ii)   Governments should, as far as possible, bringthe said stipulations to the knowledge of their forces;(b) Red Cross Convention.Artiole 27 - to read (new provisions underlined):-&quot;The High Contracting Parties shall take,in time of peace as in time of war, the necessary steps to make known the text of the presentConvention, to instruct; their armed forces(1929 - &quot;their troops&quot;), and in particular themedical personnel and the chaplains, in its provisions, and to bring them to the notioe ofthe civil-population.&quot;(c) Maritime Convention.Article 23 - &quot;The High Contracting Parties shall takethe necessary steps, in peaoe-time as in war-time, to publish the text of the present Convention, to instruct their armed forces, and in particular the medicalpersonnel and the chaplains, in its provisions, andto bring them to the notice of the civil population.&quot;(Appendix B, paragraph*49)151.     My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation toa future International Conference should accept these recommendationssubject to clarification in drafting to avoid, in particular,unnecessary overlapping.  (C. R.G.0./M(48)9* Item 60)In view of the proposed obligation to instruct all armed,forces in thelied Cross and maritime vJonventions in peace as well as in war, these^ro^proposals should perhaps be brought to the notioe of the Chiefs of Staff.
152.   Red Cross Convention - General Considerations.   The Convention        ^for the Amelioration of the Condition of the //bunded and sick  in armies in the Field (generally called, in - his Report,&quot; the Red Cross Convention)is designed, as its title implies, to ensure the proper respect for, and care of, wounded and sick of B&apos;ield Armies;   and to that end there has developed since the first Red Cross Convention (of lu64) was proposedin 1863, a series of provisions to &quot;protect&quot; the buildings, equipment,transport, stores and personnel employed in looking after wounded andsick.153.     In 1864 suoh medical personnel as were attached to armies, andtheir assistants, had nO other duty but to care for the wounded andsick.   In addition to the changes referred to in paragraphs 9 and 10above, the functions and duties of the medical services of armed forces have also been transformed;   and to-day they are integral parts of thefighting machine primarily concerned with keeping or making men andwomen fit for duty, and, it is perhaps not unfair to say, only incidental^concerned with the oare of wounded and sick as such.154.     These ohanges in the character of war (see paragraphs 9 and 10above) and in the primary function of the medical services of armedforoes (see paragraph 153 above) are responsible for the major changesin the Red Cross Convention recommended by the 1947 Geneva ConferenceGovernment Experts and discussed-in paragraphs 155 to 168, 367, 368 and below.155. &quot;Proteoted Personnel&quot;. . Under the 1929 Rea Cross Convention,persons in the following categories, if they fall into the hands ofthe enemy, are immediately returnable, viz:-(a)   all personnel engaged exclusively in the collection,transport and treatment of the wounded and sick(Article 9);-   (b)   all personnel engaged exclusively in the administrationf)f medical formations and establishments (Article 9);see also paragraphs 363 to 365 below);(0)   chaplains attached to armies (Article 9);(d) soldiers specially trained as auxiliary nurses orstretcher bearers for the collection, transport and treatment of the wounded and sick, who are capturedwhilst carrying out these functions (Article 9);(e) the personnel of Voluntary Aid Societies dulyrecognised as authorised by their Governments,employed on the same duties as those mentionedin (a) and (b) above (Artiole 10);(f) the personnel of recognised Aid Societies from neutral countries assisting a belligerent (Article U).156.     Under Articles 12 and 13 of the 1929 Red Cross Convention, anyof these personnel, who fall into the hands of the enemy:-(a)   may not be retained;(b)-  in the absence of contrary agreement, should be sentback as soon as a route is opened and military considerations permit;(o)   pending their return, should carry out their duties,under the direotion of the enemy and preferably fortheir own wounded and sick:(see also Prisoners of tfarConvention, Artiole 14, paragraph k);(d) on their repatriation may take with them, effects,instruments, arms and means of transport belongingto them;(e) whilst with the enemy should get the same food,lodging, allowances and pay as correspondingpersonnel of the enemy&apos;s own armed forces.157.     The provision for immediate return (see paragraph 156(b) above)-
has proved unworkable in two World Wars;   and when repatriation ofprotected personnel has beoome possible, usually after a long ;interval and difficult negotiations, the result produces inequityin that certain non-medical personnel, e.g. an K.A.S.C. driver,oaptured whilst driving an ambulance, may be repatriated, whilsthis comrades oaptured (may be much earlier) whilst driving lorriesremain prisoners of war.   This inequity gave rise to some critioismafter repatriation of &quot;protected personnel&quot; began in the second world War. -156.     Long and controversial discussions took place at the 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts before they agreed torecommend:-(a) that the description of medical &quot;protected personnel&quot;should be expanded to cover those engaged &quot;in theprevention of disease&quot;;(b) that all &quot;protected&quot; personnel should become prisonersof war on falling into the hands of the enemy:this would give them a recognised status as prisonersof war whioh they have hitherto lacked, with definedrights to. food, clothing, accommodation, of access to the Protecting Power, notification of capture .-and subsequent casualties to the Power in whoseforces they were serving at,the time of capture,protection in the event of disciplinary or judicialproceedings, the right to full medical treatment,-correspondence, receipt of parcels, etc:   only food and accommodation are legislated for under the existingConvention (see paragraph 156(e) above);    (in practice,they were generally treated as prisoners of warduring the Second &quot;World War, except in matters of pay, work, certain additional freedoms and repat-riation);(o)   whilst engaged in looking after wounded and sick,they should before capture, have complete immunity from attack, and after capture, when required tocarry out their function of oaring for wounded andsick, they should be given all facilities andfreedoms necessary;(d)   they should, if not required to look after wounded and sick, be repatriable.159.     The change referred to in paragraph 158(a) above recognised,up to a point, the transformation in the functions of militarymedical services (see paragraph 153 above and the addition of the phrase &quot;in the prevention of disease&quot; is intended to remove any doubt that the protection from attack accorded by the lied. CrossConvention is intended to cover all medical personnel.   MyCaomittee desires me to call attention to this proposed development,whioh seems to introduce a new principle not inherent in theoriginal basis of the &quot;protection&quot; of medical personnel, i.e. as a means to ensure the oare of the wounded and sick (see paragraph 152above).160.     My Committee recommend that the united Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should not propose any limitation of the medical personnel who may claim the protectionof the Red Cross;   but that the delegation should be fully briefedon this issue in case it be raised by another delegation. (C.R.G. C./^(46)5,Item 37)161.     At the 1947 Conference the United Kingdom delegationmaintained the view that the right to repatriation of &quot;protectedpersonnel&quot; should in future be limited to doctors and nurses;this right was conoeded in view of their humanitarian value and theshortage of professionally qualified doctors and nurses in every country in war-time:   the Conference Report recommends that allhitherto &quot;protected&quot; personnel should be repatriable, but that wasnot agreed by the United Kingdom delegation;   nor, according to my
notes, by the other British Commonwealth and United States delegations!^162.   My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation toa future International Conference:-(a) should support the recommendation of the 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts that &quot;protectedpersonnel&quot; should, on falling into the hands of theenemy, become prisoners of war and except as provided in (b; and (o) below, be protected by the Prisoners ofWar Convention;(b) should support the recommendations of the 0547 geneva conference of Government Experts that medical personnel and ohaplains. oaring for the wounded and sick should always be respected and given the maximum freedom from attack or interference;   and, that when aftercapture, they are required to care for wounded and sick ,they should be given all necessary facilities andfreedoms;(o)   should support the repatriation, at the first opportunityafter capture, of doctors and nurses, not required tocare for wounded and sick in the enemy&apos;s hands;-(&amp;)   should oppose the repatriation (except on the same terms as combatant personnel) of other &quot;protectedpersonnel .    ^C./M(47)5, Item 41 and C.R.G.C. At(48)2163.   The Director-General, Army Medioal Servioes, considers:- &apos;(a)   that the repatriable categories should be widenedto include dentists and &quot;skilled medical technicians&quot;such as radiographers, laboratory technicians,masseurs, etc;and (b)   that, if (a) is not acceptable the term &quot;nurses&quot; inparagraph 162(c) above should be limited to &quot;trained. female members of the nursing profession corresponding to our State Registered Nurses.&quot;164.   The argument used to justify retaining repatriation rights forany of the &quot;protected personnel&quot; entitled to be returned to their own forces under the 1929 Red Cross Convention is set out in paragraph 161above;   and the view of the Director-General, Army Medioal Servioes,set out in paragraph 163(b) above is logioally the consequence ofthat argument.   Few countries, however, have clear professionalstandards for &quot;nurses&quot;;   and a narrow definition, suoh as that suggestedin paragraph 163(b) above, might, I fear, not find acceptance in anInternational Conference, on the grounds that it would work inequitablyas between countries with clearly defined professional nursing standards and those without.   This consideration guided my Committee in choosingthe loose term &quot;nurses&quot;:   in a war, any particular interpretation tobe placed on this term would, no doubt, be settled between two adversebelligerents, when negotiating arrangements for an exchange ofrepatriable personnel.165.   Similarly, I think that it would be difficult to translate intoterms, giving effective reciprocity as between all the signatories toa Red Cross Convention, the formula proposed in paragraph 163(a)above;   and, the practical solution lies, I suggest, either inrepatriation rights being limited to the narrow classification of doctors and nurses(based on the argument in paragraph l6l above),or allowing all medical personnel (including dental surgeons) tobe repatriable.I06.   Moreover, it would not be easy to defend, I suggest, a proposal that a medical technician should be repatriable, whilst excludingfrom repatriation, not only the Sapper technician, who happened tone a hospital electrician at.the time of capture, and practically all members of Voluntary Aid Detachments.167.   here it may be desirable to anticipate Part V of this Report
dealing with the proposed ixaritime Convention, to say that the 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended deliberatelythat hospital ships and the crews and staffs should be immune fromcapture, because it is an essential function of hospital ships tomove, possible through combat zones;   and the ships would be      ... \incapable of functioning if deprived of their crews or staffs.  $heXposition of a medical unit on land, falling into the hands of anenemy, is very different.   In that case the effective functioning Ofthe unit depends on whether the enemy chooses to use it, or tomake other arrangements for the care of the captured wounded andsick.168.   Chaplains.   The Chaplains Department of the three Services haveaooepted the recommendation that chaplains should no longer berepatriable.   If, however, repatriation rights were to inoludemilitary mediaal technicians las suggested in paragraph 163(a)above), I think there might be an equally strong case for chaplainsremaining repatriable.169.   Use of the Red Cross Emblem on Land.   The Red Cross emblem(i.e. the Swiss national flag with colours reversed) was invented to mark distinctively units and establishments caring for militarywounded and sick , in order that they should be immune from attaok,whether direotly by armed forces or indirectly by bombardment, andtherefore free to pursue their humanitarian task of oaring for the wounded and sick.   Article 19 of the 1929 Red Cross Convention providesfor the &quot;heraldic emblem of the red cross on a white ground&quot; to be used as &quot;the emblem and distinctive sign of the medioal services of armed-forces&quot;;   and recognises similarly &quot;the Red Cresoent or the Red Lionand Sun&quot; where such are already in use &quot;in place of the Red Cross&quot;., -170.   Artiole 24 of the 1929 Red Cross Convention prohibits the useof the emblem or the words &quot;Red Cross&quot; or &quot;Geneva Cross&quot;, in peace or war,&quot;except to protect or indicate the medioal formations and establishments and the personnel and material protected by the Convention,&quot;though the same Article also allows, under strict control, its usein peace by Voluntary Aid Societies, and to mark certain &quot;aidstations&quot; (see paragraph 171 below).   This prohibition is emphasisedby Article 28 which lays upon Parties to the Convention the obligationto secure legislation enforcing this prohibition and bringing within it &quot;marks constituting an imitation&quot; of the Red Cross or of the swiss Federal colours.   This obligation is met, so far as the Unitedkingdom is concerned by the Geneva Convention Acts of 1911 and 1937.171.   The only uses of the Red Cross on land (for use on aircraft or at sea, see paragraphs 185 - 189 below) , other than by militarymedical services, sanctioned by the 1929 Red Cross Convention, are:-&quot;(a) by Voluntary Aid Societies, reoognised by their governments, in connection with their &quot;humanitarian&quot;activities&quot; in time of peaoe; v(b) &quot;as an exceptional measure&quot; and subject to strict control&quot;to mark the position of Aid Stations exclusivelyreserved for the purpose 01&apos; giving free treatment tothe wounded or the sick&quot; in time of peaoe. (Article 24)It will be noted &quot;that these two exceptional uses are limited to &quot;timeof peace&quot;.172.   Nevertheless there has developed, in practice, a wider use ofthe Red Cross, generally oalied &quot;descriptive&quot;.   The organs of theInternational Ked Cross (the International Red Cross Committee, theLeague of Red Cross-Societies, and the International Red CrossConference and its Permanent Commission) have used it to markbuildings occupied by them, on notepaper, publications, etc., onbuttonhole badges and broociies and on motor-cars arid other vehicles;and National Red Cross Societies generally have followed a similarpractice.   None of these uses finds any sanction in the 1929 Red
Gross Convention and they probably constitute technical breaches of   4 t\ that Convention.   This &quot;descriptive&quot; use of the Red Cross emblem is, -IwUhowever, suoh an obvious corollary of the use of the words &quot;RedGross&quot; in the titles of these organisations, as to cause no objection in any quarter.173.   In some countries the use of the words &quot;Red Cross&quot; and of theemblem are not, in faot, limited to the purposes referred to inparagraphs 169 to 172 above.   In many countries civil hospitals use theemblem;   and Red Cross shoes have been produced and sold in another country, whioh had to have their description changed to Golden Crossshoes for import into the United Kingdom.   The American Red Cross is responsible for the oanteen services of the United States forces andfor much welfare work, functions whioh are not contemplated by the -1929 Red Cross Convention as appropriate to the &quot;Red Cross&quot;.   It isprobably true to say that the countries of the British Commonwealthhave generally interpreted their obligations to limit the use of thewords and emblem of the &quot;Red Cross&quot; more, strictly than many other signatories to the 1929 Red Cross Convention.   Uy Committee did notthink that any change in this attitude is desirable, even though itmay hot always be followed elsewhere.174.   This strict view of the permissible uses of the Red Cross naturallyresults in the United Kingdom examining critically any proposals toextfend the authorised use of the Red Cross:   lest suoh extension mightweaken the effectiveness of the protection given to the wounded andsiok in time of war.   Sir John Kennedy, Vioe-Chairman of the BritishRed Cross Society, who has given long and careful study to this andother matters of interest to the Society, draws a distinction betweenthe &quot;long range&quot; protection given by the Red Cross and what he calls&quot;contact&quot; proteotion.175.   &quot;Long range&quot; protection oan be given only by large flags orpainted signs, which are visible from a distance;   and with the increasing range of artillery and other methods of bombardment, theproteotion given by this use of the Red Cross to military hospitals, etc.is tending to diminish.   Nevertheless it is still of great value andnothing should be done, whioh might give unscrupulous foes any excuse for disregarding these protective signs, when they oan be seen.176.   &quot;Contact&quot; protection is a very different matter.   This operateswhen fighting approaches or even surrounds a medical unit or establishment;and strict observance of the conditions for the use of the Red Cross will go far to maintain the respect and immunity from attack, which it is designed to give.   On the other hand, any relaxations from the striotlimitation of its use to protect only medioal units and establishments(beoause of their care for the wounded and sick of both sides in abattle) might diminish the respect, whioh it would command in the midstof battle.177.   It was with these considerations in mind that my Committee examined the extensions of the authorised use of the Red Cross emblem on landrecommended by the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts viz:-(a) by Voluntary Aid Societies in time of war (the 1529Red Cross Convention allows its use by them only in timeof peace) provided that&quot;the size of the emblem and the conditions of its -use are such that it cannot, in time of war, beconsidered as conferring the proteotion of thepresent Convention&quot;;(b) by the organs of the International Red Cross, at all times,subjeot to the same proviso as in (a) above;(c) in time of peace, to mark ambulanoes (i.e. civil ambulances)as wexl as aid stations;(d) to mark civilian hospitals in time of war in order togive them the same proteotion as given to militaryhospitals.
176.   i.y Committee recommend that tne-United Kingdom delegation toa future International Conference:-^a)   should discourage any-extension of the general useof the Red Cross emblem, except under strictlycontrolled and defined conditions;(J.R.G.0./1448)5, Item 38(a))(b) should not oppose the recommendations of the 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts regardingthe &quot;descriptive&quot; use of the Red Cross emblem on civil ambulances in peace, and by the organs of theInternational Red Cross and by National Red CrossSocieties in war, as weil as in peace;(c.R,G.C./ii(48)5, Item 38(b)) -(c) should support any proposals for strictly limiting the size of the emblem, when used for &quot;descriptive&quot;purposes; -  &apos;(,j. R, G. C. /u.(48)5, Item 38(c))(d) should agree to the *proteotive&quot; use of the Red Crossemblem by civil hospitals in war-time, subject to reasonable conditions of control being devised(see paragraph 180 below),&apos;&apos;(P.R.G. j./k(48)5, Item 40)179.   In connection with the recommendation in paragraph 178(b)above, my Committee invited the Board of Trade representative torecousmend to his Department, as responsible for administering the geneva Convention Aot of 1937, that any extension of the &quot;descriptiveuse of the Red Cjross should not be allowed to extend the use of&quot;oolourable imitations&quot; of the Red Cross,180.   With reference to the recommendation in paragraph 178(d)above, my Committee further recommend that, to qualify to use the   -Red Cross emblem for protection, an establishment(a)   must be recognised as a civil hospital by the State;(bj   must be organised to afford permanently oare towounded and sick, or to maternity oases;-(c) must have the consent of the military authorities touse the Red Cross emblem;(d) . must not be used to commit acts harmful to the enemy;(e) must exhibit in the building a oertifioate, in a prescribed form, from the state;(f) should be subject to inspection by representativesof the Protecting Power of any adverse belligerentand/or of the International Red Cross Committee inorder that they might satisfy themselves that theconditions laid down in the Convention were beingobserved.(C. R. g. C. ,.4.(48)6, Item 43)181.   There was no suggestion at the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts that the &quot;protective&quot; use of the Red Cross inwar-time should be extended to civil ambulances (see-paragraph177(c) above) as. well as to civil hospitals;    but this may be proposed at a future Conference.182.   Finally I should record, that, in making the recommendation in paragraph 178(b) above, my Committee recognise that certain&quot;descriptive&quot; uses by National Red Cross Societies an war-time,tfti. ok olaoues outside buildings) might tend to weaken the&quot;contact&quot;&apos;protection (see paragraph 176 above; given by theemoxem to hospitals, dressing stations;   but they came to the
conclusion that the risk of this was not likely to be serious- .    ^ i183.   Use of the Red Cross Emblem at Sea.   The use of the Red Crossflag and emblem by hospital ships is authorised by Article 5 of the tenth Hague Convention of 1907 (for the Adaptation of the Principlesof the Geneva Convention to Maritime Warfare) and Article 6 limitstheir use to suoh ships only.   The new Maritime Convention proposedto replace the Tenth Hague Convention (see paragraphs 8 and 15 above)is considered in paragraphs 444 - 449   below and Appendix B-   but certain extensions in the use of the Red Cross are proposed under the prisoners of War Convention.184.   These extensions would reoognise uses covered by special agreements between all belligerents concerned during the Second World War-togive immunity from attack, under certain     conditions, to:-(a) ships set aside exclusively for the carriage of relief-      \        supplies, mail etc. for prisoners of war (see paragraphs 126 to 136 above);(b) ships carrying out the exchange of personnel repatriatedunder Article 68 of the 1929 Prisoners of War convention and Article 12 of the 1929 Red Cross Convention.These ships were allowed to be painted white with Red Crosses onsides and decks in a similar manner to hospital ships;   and they all carried International Red Cross Committee delegates as superoargoguaranteeing that they were conforming to the conditions of safe conductagreed between the belligerents.185.   i3y Committee recommend that the united Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference(a) should agree to the &quot;protective&quot; use of.the Red Crossflag and emblem at sea by(i) hospital ships of such minimum size as is recommended by the Maritime Sub-Committee(see paragraphs 35 and 36 of Appendix B)(ii) ships set aside for the carriage exclusivelyof relief supplies, mails etc. for prisonersof war etc., provided they are sailing undersafe conducts from the belligerents;(iii)   ships carrying out exchanges of repatriablepersonnel; m(b) should oppose the use of the Red Cross flag or emblemby any rescue ships or craft not recognised as hospital ships (see paragraph 7 of Appendix B)(C.R.public./k(48)5, Item 39)My Committee assume that whatever markings are ultimately adopted for hospital ships (see Appendix B, paragraph 3 8 ), similar markings willbe authorised for other ships referred to in (a) above.186.   Use of the Red Cross emblem on Aircraft.   The protection of medical aircraft has been considered in paragraphs 139 to 143 above,.and subject to fulfilment of the conditions reoommended in paragraph143(b) above, there is clearly no objection to the use of the red cross markings on a white ground on such aircraft.   The use of n^ioalaircraft at sea would be subject to similar conditions (see Appendix B,paragraph 46)137.   In addition, the International Red Cross Committee seek-authorisaoion-for aircraft set aside for the carriage exclusively,of prisoner of war mail and that of the Central Agency (see article /of the SS Prisonert of ,7ar Convention), and of information concerningprisoners of war, identity cards, etc. should be authorised to carrySed Cross markings on a white ground and be immune from attack.   Subject
again to the conditions recommended in paragraph 343 0?; above, myCommittte see no ground for objection.162.   As has already been observed in paragraph 141 above, when on theground, aircraft so marked would be conspicuous from the air, andthis&apos;would negative any camouflage precautions on the airfieldconcerned.   For this reason, it is unlikely that belligerents willdesire to have aircraft so marked using their airfields.   Neverthelessmy Committee cams to the conclusion that.it would be undesirable for the United Kingdom to oppose, in principle, proposals to authorisethe use of the Red Cross emblem by aircraft fulfilling the conditionsreoommended in paragraph 143(b) above.189.   My Committee therefore recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should not oppose the use of theRed Cross emblem on a white ground by medical aircraft or by aircraftreserved exclusively f or any of the purposes mentioned in paragraph 187above,.&apos; provided that they fulfil the conditions recommended inparagraph 343(b) above.(CR.G.C./M(48)4, Item 33C.R.G.C./li(48)5, Item 39(b))190.   Encircled Zones and Hospital Zones.   The 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts recommended new provisions for the Red CrossConvention that(a)   &quot;local arrangements may be concluded between belligerentsfor the removal of wounded and sick from a besiegedor encircles zone, and for the passage of medicalpersonnel and equipment bound for the said zone&quot;&apos;(b)   belligerents may conclude particular agreements forthe -creation of hospital zones, to ensure betterprojection for the wounded and sick of armed forcesassembled therein, to the exclusion of anyutilisation for military purposes&quot;.191.   The first of the recommendations&apos;, referred to in paragraph 190above can be regarded as an extension of the provision in Article 3of the 1929 Red Cross Convention that &quot;whenever circumstances permit,a local armistice or a suspension of fire shall be arranged topermit the removal of the wounded remaining between the lines&quot;.   The1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended that thewords after &quot;removal&quot; should be amended to read &quot;and transport ofwounded&quot;, as more in accord with the conditions of modern warfare.192.   The proposals made to the 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts would have made arrangements for passage in and out ofenoiroled zones and for the creation of hospital zones almostobligatory.   It was argued that military hospitals already enjoyoomplete protection, so long as they are not used to commit acts-harmful to the enemy;   and that a hospital &quot;zone&quot; was, in prinoiple,no more than a number of hospital units side by side.   Thedifficulties were pointed out, such as(a) the impossibility of preventing entry by unauthorisedpersons;(b) the difficulty of removing all military objectives;(c) the difficulties inherent in using suoh zones ifremoved from normal lines of communication;(d) the enforcement of any prohibition against airoraftflying over suoh a zone.193.   As a result of the heavy criticism the proposals ultimatelyemerged as recommendations in the form set out in paragraph 190 above.Both are now permissive and dependent on special ad hoc agreements.The former goes little further than was, in fact, agreed during the later days of the Second World War for &quot;pcokets&quot; of enemy resistance in Belgium and France.
194.   In connection with the proposed Civilian Convention a proposals nohas been made to establish Safety Zones for the proteotion of civiiiJn&amp;,0children, expectant mothers, mothers of young children, and old&quot;peopleThis proposal was referred to the Chiefs of Staff by the Home Office.The Chiefs of Staff considered that the application of this proposalto the United Kingdom or in enemy territories is neither practicablenor acceptable from the military point of view:   they oointed out thatit might even embarrass the defence arrangements for the United Kingdom-and were also of the opinion that the scheme would offer no practicable&apos;advantages in other British Administered Territories.195.   My Committee were not aware of the reference to the Chiefs ofStaff when they agreed the recommendations set out in paragraph 197below.   Whereas an obligation to establish Safety Zones may be clearlyunacceptable, the proposal to include permissive provisions as set outin paragraph 190 above was not brought to the notice of the Chiefs ofStaff.   To rejeot, out of hand, the permissive provisions set out inparagraph 190(b) above would be difficult, I suggest, in any Inter-national Conference;   I would emphasise that, so far as the UnitedKingdom is concerned, such provisions could never be brought intoOperation without a particular agreement to which we should be a party.196.   I recognise that if my Committee^ recommendation in paragraph 197below is aooepted, it will be diffioult to resist similar permissiveprovisions, subject to &quot;particular agreements&quot;, in the civilian convention;   but the considerations which influenced my Committee donot appear to have been brought to the notice of the Chiefs of Staffbefore they reaohed the conclusions referred to in paragraph 194above.197*   My Committee recommend that, subjeot to the approval of theChiefs of Staff, the United Kingdom delegation to a future international conference should not oppose the recommendations of the 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts set out in paragraph 19O above..(C.R.G.C./M(48)4, Item 30)198.   Civilian help for Wounded and Sick.   Artiole 5 of the 1929Red Cross Convention permits military authorities to appeal to &quot;thecharitable zeal of the inhabitants&quot; to collect and care fox: the wounded and sick , an echo of the first Red Cross Convention of 1864,which sprang from Henry Dunant&apos;s experiences at the&apos; Battle of Solferinoin 1859*   This provision clearly contemplates that the wounded andsiok will be those for whom the military authorities are responsible,i.e. of the same forces, or prisoners of war in their hands;   and theArtiole provides for the civilian assistance to be given under thedirection of the military authorities.199.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts, was invited to expand the existing provision to make them apply also to &quot;enemybelligerents&quot; in oocupied territory and to cover specifically &quot;enemywounded or sick&quot;.   A long discussion took place at Geneva on this latterprovision because it was proposed that the obligation on the militaryauthorities &quot;to allow and encourage the civilian population, even in occupied regions, to collect and care for enemy wounded and sick&quot;should be aooompanied by a condition that the wounded and sick &quot;shallnot be assisted to elude the possible control of the occupyingauthority.&quot;200.   Conscious of the servioes rendered to allied aircrews and otherescaping members of allied forces by the peoples of the oountries of western Europe oocupied by the Germans during the Second ^orld War, theUnited Kingdom delegation resisted the inclusion of this or any a^larcondition? They argued that a Convention for the protection of wounded and sick was not an appropriate place in which to lay on the civilian population of an occupied country an obligation to ref^e to helptheir friends to escape from their enemies;   and taat to insert sucha condition^ would enable an Occupying Power to claim that to give such-help, to ^wounded or sick soldier or ai^woul^, underfr&quot;tionWa or^L^s own decrees, but that was hardlya reason for giving such a decree the support of an International
Convention.2C1.   The counter-argument was that occupying authorities could not beexpected &quot;to allow and encourage&quot; care for enemy wounded and sick,unless they could, in return, have some guarantee that this would not operate to their disadvantage.202.   Eventually the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended that the obligation on the military authorities should besubject to a condition that enemy wounded and sick&quot;shall not be withheld from the eventual oontrol of national or occupying authorities&quot;the United Kingdom delegation reserving its attitude.203.   My Committee came to the oonolusion that, unless the Chiefs ofStaff oonsider desirable, provisions in the Red Cross Convention on thelines set out in paragraphs I99 and 202 above, the United kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should oppose any provision which would include the condition set out in paragraph 202above, or any similar condition;   and they reoommend accordingly.(C.R.G.C./m(48)4, Item 30(d)) &apos;204.   Pinger-Prints.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Expertsfavoured the carrying by all persons liable to be made prisoners Ofwar, of an identity card, if possible of a standard shape, size andlay-out;   but there was strong pressure from the United States andthe majority of other delegations to include, on suoh identity cards,finger or thumb prints and for suoh prints to be taken by the detaining Power (as is the practice of the United States) as a meansof identifying prisoners of war.   The other questions arising onidentity documents are considered in paragraph 419 below.205.   The proposal to use finger-prints as a means of identificationraises a major question of polioy for the United Kingdom.   My Committeewere advised by the Some Office representative that, in this country,the taking of finger prints is associated by the public with their use&apos;for recording and identifying criminals;   and for this reason it wouldbe inadvisable to undertake an obligation to use them on the identitycards of persons liable to be taken prisoner of war.206.   My Committee were also informed, however, that during the second world War merchant seamen from the United Kingdom carried identity cardsbearing their finger-prints, because without such prints they would nothave been able to land in the United States.207.   In these circumstanoes my committee reoommend that the UnitedKingdom delegation to a future International Conference should press that any provision regarding the use of finger-prints to assist the identification of prisoners of war should be optional;   and that anystandard identity card should accordingly provide for finger-printsor signature.   (C.R.G.C./M(48)6, Item 46(bj(viii))208.   War Crimes and Sanctions.   In paragraph 99 above I have referredto the strong pressure, at the 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts, to exclude any prisoner of war suspected of a war crime fromthe protection of the Prisoners of War Convention.   Very strong pressuresimilarly developed from most other delegations to write into theConvention provisions describing certain breaches of them as war Crimes,and obliging signatory Powers to take action against the persons concerned.   The United States, French, Netherlands and other delegationsinsisted that there must be specific provision for the punishment ofthose responsible for serious violations of the Conventions.209.   The main argument, used at the 1947 Conference in support ofthis attitude, was that those ooncerned with the praotioal applicationof these Conventions (e.g. Commandants of Prisoner of War Camps)should have brought to their notice, in the Conventions, that violationsare war crimes to be visited with punishment;   and that, to be effective,punishment ought to be certain, and it should therefore be obligatory
for all signatory Powers to take the necessary legislative measuresto that end.   This attitude refleots the strong public opinion on thissubject in their countries, resulting from the treatment of their nationals by the&quot; German and/or the Japanese authorities during theSeoond World War.   The subsequent War Grime trials have led, not unnaturally, to a demand for&quot;explicit legislation on the subject;   andthis has found opportunity for open expression in t.he discussions onthe Conventions now under consideration, which are the first inter-national efforts after the Second World War to review laws relating tothe conduct of war.&apos;&apos;   &quot;      &apos;   .&apos;v - &apos; &apos; &quot;,     -   &apos; -&quot;&apos; :       &apos; ; , - .210.   The United Kingdom delegation at the 1947 Conference argued,inter alia -&apos;&apos; -(a) that Conventions safeguarding the treatment ofWounded and sick  and Prisoners of War (and alsocivilians) were not suitable for internationalpenal provisions;(b) that breaches of these international Conventionswere, in any case, war crimes and no new provision was needed to establish them as such;(c) that to specify some breaches only as war crimes,might give accused persons ground for argument, by implication, that any other breach of these Conventionswas, therefore, not a war crime:    in other words theeffect might be to narrow the field of war crimesunder International Law;(d) that any provisions regarding penalties for breakingthese Conventions ought to foriu.parf of an internationalpenal code, and not be dealt with, without regard to the penalties regarded as appropriate for other war crimes.211.   These arguments did not prevail, and, the United Kingdom delegation,reserving its attitude, the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government ilcpertsrecommended inolusibn in the Ked Gross Convention of a new Articleproposed by the United States delegation in the following terms:---&quot;Any wilful violation of the present Convention, leading to the death of persons protected by its provisions, to graveill-treatment of the said persons, or serious damage to hospital buildings and equipment, shall be considered as awar crime.   The responsible persons shall be liable to appropriate penalties.The high Contracting Parties undertake to insei-t in theirpenal and military legislation provisions for the punishment- of any infractions of the stipulations of the presentConvention&quot;and that corresponding Artioles be embodied in the other Conventions.212.   The situation thus created has been examined at length by theForeign Office, and they and I have also discusaed it with represent-atives of the Home Office and the Treasury Solicitor.   We are unanimousthat the inclusion of an Article on the lines of that recommended bythe 1947 Conference (see paragraph 211 above) would be unfortunate,and might even have some results contrary to those intended by it.   Inaddition to the arguments advanced by the United Kingdom delegation tothe 1947 Conference (see paragraph 210 above), other objections are summarised in paragraphs 213 - 215 below.213.   A prisoner of war., is completely at the mercy of the detaining power:    to inalude in  &quot;Convention which will be posted up^in allcamps, a provision whioh might lead prisoners of war, who feelsome Article of the Convention is not being observed, to threaten tneirCamp Commandant with punishment as a war criminal, migho worsen uieirtreatment rather than the reverse.214.   To include suoh an Article might make some Powers reluctant to
become signatories to the Convention.   Moreover these humanitarianConventions would be the first International treaties to mentionwar crimes,, and they are the wrong &quot;type of treaty into whioh to &apos;introduce suoh legislation for the i&apos;irst time.   To specify in themcertain violations as war crimes would be 20 imply that otherviolations were not, and this would be to narrow and not tostrengthen existing International law on war crimes.215.   The jurisprudence of war crimes should be discussed and settledoutside these Conventions, the main purpose of whicn is quite different.   It might be possible to draw up a list of penaltiesappropriate to particular violations;    but unless and until that canbe done (and in doing it regard should clearly be had to the penaltiesappropriate to other war crimes) it would be wise to avoid any reference to penalties in these Conventions.216.   nevertheless, it may prove impossible to persuade other delegationsat a future International Conference to this view;   and we have,therefore, sought for a formula-, which might satisfy the feelingsbehind the pressure for some specific reference to war crimes, whilst-avoiding definite legislation. -217.   iuy Committee therefore recommend that the United kingdom delegation to a future International Conference(a) should resist, if possible, any reference being made inthe Prisoners of War, Red Cross and Maritime Conventionsto war crimes or punishments for breaches of the conventions;(b) if (a) is unsuccessful, should propose an Article on thefollowing lines:-s&quot;While the responsibility for the due observance ofthis Convention rests with the High&apos; Contracting Party,individuals who commit aots contrary to the law ofnations are personally answerable for such acts,and neither the official functions with which theymay be invested nor orders from superior authoritiesare a defence in regard to the commission of suchaots&quot;;(o)   failing (a) or (b), should be prepared to agree to anm Article dealing with war crimes, provided that it makes! reference only to the penalties attaching to breaches of International Law generally, and does not appear to define either war crimes or their precise consequences.(C.R.G.C./4d(48)9, Item 61)218.   This is likely to be one of the most difficult subjects forthe United Kingdom delegation to any future International Conference;and it is most desirable that their instructions should state, asdearly as possible, the limit of. concession to whioh they are authorised to go..219.   Questions common to the Military and Civilian Conventions.   Ofthe questions considered in this part of the Report the followingarise also on the proposed Civilian Convention:-(a) Civil War (paragraphs 30 to 36 above)(b) Intangibility (paragraphs 55 to 61 above)(c) Joint Responsibility for transferred Prisoners (orInternees) paragraphs 72 to 80 above)(d) Substitute for Protecting Power (paragraphs 144 to148 above)(e) ,v&apos;ar Crimes and Sanctions (paragraphs 208 to 218 above)(f) Hospital Zones and Safety Localities (paragraphs 190to 197 above)
The recommendations of my Committee on (b), (o), (d) and (e) (see      130paragraphs 60, 60, 148-and 217 above) are substantially, the same asthose being made by Mr. Strutfs Committee on the proposed civilian convention.   The difference of approach on paragraph 219(f) hasalready been referred to in paragraph 195 above.220.   In the oase of Civil War (see paragraph 219(b) above), however,Mr. Strutfs Committee is likely to reoommend, I understand, that theUnited Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should refuse to agree to the proposed Civilian Convention being applied.This differs from the recommendation of my Committee in paragraph 34above. m These differences will, no doubt, be taken into considerationby all the Departments concerned in considering the recommendations ofboth Committees.221.   Summary of Recommendations in Part II.   The recommendations inthis part of my Report, on which instructions for the United kingdom delegation to a future International Conference are desirable, may besummarised as follows:-(a) Civil War:   that the application of the Red Cross and prisoners of War Conventions to Civil War should beaccepted so long as the wording allows the lawfulGovernment the decision as to when the Conventionsbecome operative (paragraph 34);(b) Partisans:    that the Red Cross and Prisoners of WarConventions should be applied to &quot;partisans&quot;, provided -that they fulfil specified conditions (paragraphs 41and 43)J.(c) Surrendered Enemy Personnel;    that specific provisionsregarding Surrendered Enemy personnel should be embodied in the Prisoners of War Convention (paragraph 50);(d) Derogations:   that &quot;derogations&quot; from the Prisoners ofWar Convention should be admissible during the period immediately following capture and at other exceptionaltimes, (paragraph 54);(e) Intangibility:   that the maximum liberty should be allowedto signatories of the Prisoners of tfar Convention to varyit, by mutual agreement provided that its fundamental principles are observed (paragraph 60); -(f) Work:   that the use of prisoners of war(i)   on unhealthy or dangerous work be permissible,subject to certain conditions (paragraphs 66and 64);(ii)   on degrading work be prohibited (paragraphs 66and 65);(iii) be permissible on agriculture, forestry and civil engineering, and, by military forces onany work not directly connected with operations against an enemy or the production or handling of weapons or ammunition (paragraph 71);(iv) in a zone of active operations be prohibited(paragraph 71).(g) Transferred prisoners of war:(i)   that transfer of prisoners of war to a Powernot a signatory to the prisoners of Jar Conventionbe prohibited (paragraph 73);(ii)    that the Power transferring prisoners of war toanother rower, should have no responsibility fortheir treatment by that rower (paragraph 60;;

The recommendations referred to in paragraph 221(b), (h), (u),(w),  (bb), (cc), are subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff(see Appendix A).223.   The remarks on the Treatment of Women (paragraph 92 above) and onParole (paragraphs 93 to 95 above) have been included in this partof my Report because they seemed of high importance;   but no reoommend-ations oalling for decision by higher authority arise on these subjects.PART III - OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTIONSA - Prisoners of War Convention224.   A new Artiole. was recommended by the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts about the application of the Convention to
Undeclared Wars and Civil tfars. This has already been oonsidered inparagraphs 3C to 36 above.225.   P.W. Artible 1 - Persons covered by the Convention, (see also for &quot;Partisans&quot; paragraphs 37 to 43 above and for &quot;Protected Personnel&quot;paragraphs 155 to 167 above and paragraphs 363 to 365 below).   france and  other European powers, following experience in the Second world war, v/ant to extend the protection of the Prisoners of War Convention(and also the Wounded and Sick Convention) to everyone who takes upVarms against an enemy, whether continuously or intermittently.226.   Article 1 of the i929 Prisoners of War Convention covers:-(a) all those referred to in the first three Articles,ofthe Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention of the18th October, 1907 concerning the Laws and Customs ofWar on Land, viz:-(i)   the army and, subject to certain conditions,militia and volunteer forces;(ii)   the spontaneously risen inhabitants of aninvaded territory, subject to certain conditionswho are captured in land warfare;(b) all those belonging to the &quot;armed forces&quot; who are oapturedin the course of maritime or aerial war.227.   There was general agreement at the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts that any new Convention should specifically oovar:-(a) all members of the armed forces (see also (f) below);(b) all members of militia and volunteer foroes, subject tothe 1907 Hague Rules, viz:-(i)   they must be commanded by a person responsible   -for his subordinates; *(ii)   they must have a fixed distinctive sign recognisableat a distance; /(iii)   they must carry arms openly;   and(iv)   they must conduct their operations in accordancewith the laws and customs of war;(o)   all merchant seamen, captured at sea;(d) &quot;mass levies&quot; (see paragraphs 226(a)(ii) above);(e) civilian members of air crews, provided that they are connected with the armed forces of a belligerent;(f) members of the armed foroes (whether serving, reservistsor demobilised) taken into custody by a belligerentbecause they are such;(g) camp followers (now covered by Article 81 of the 1929Prisoners of War Convention whioh is recommended to be merged into Article 1);but there were differences of opinion at the 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts regarding.two classes, viz:-(h) &quot;partisans&quot;, meaning resistance movements and otherirregulars (see paragraphs 44 to 50 above);(j)   merchant seamen arrested in port.
228.. Regarding the latter, the United States and some other countries would treat them as oivilian interness.   Experience in this oountryduring the Second World War points strongly to treating all internedmerchant seamen as prisoners of war;   and the Ministry of Transport      1^2favour this for British merchant seamen, provided always that their- 6status as &quot;non-combatantsn is made dear.229.   My Committee reoommend that, subject to paragraph 41 above, allthe classes referred to in paragraph 226 above, and any other merchant seamen who may be interned, should be oovered by the Prisoners of war convention (C.R.G.C./1*(47).2, Item 12).230.   P.W. Artiole 1 - Other Questions.(a)   &quot;Surrendered Enemy Personnel&quot; - see paragraphs 44 to50 above;, (b)   Derogations from the provisions of the Convention -.   see paragraphs 51 to 54;(o)   &quot;Intangibility&quot; of the Convention - see paragraphs 55to 61 above.231.   P.W. Artiole 2 - This and Articles 3 and 4 of the 1929 Prisonersof War Convention lay down hasio principles.   Apart from the questions arising on transfers of prisoners of war from one Detaining Power to anotheralready considered in paragraphs 72 to 80 above, this Article calls forno comment.232.   P. W. Article 3 - see Part IV.233.   P.W. Artiole 4 - The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended two changes, viz:-that the Detaining Pcver should provide &quot;free of charge&quot;all necessary maintenance, &quot;including medical care&quot;.These changes are designed to make it clear that the Detaining Power is wholly responsible for providing for all prisoners bf war all essentials,&quot;free of charge&quot;.   Hitherto officers were required to pay for theirfood and clothing (Article 22);   other ranks were provided free.   Thechange for officers is linked with the ohanges recommended regardingpay (see paragraph 108(b) above).234.   The 1947 Conference also recommended that privileged treatmentwould be permissible only if based on;-(a) military rank;or (b) physical or mental health;or (o) age;.or (d) professional capacity;or (e) sex(see also paragraphs 92 above and 296,298,35^ and 383 below)1235.   My Committee recommend approval of the recommendations referredto in paragraphs 233 and 234 above.    (C.R.G. C./M(47)4, Items 30 and 31).236.   P.W. Artiole 5 - Interrogation - see Part IV; : . \ &apos;^        &apos;.&quot;*&apos;.&apos;..&apos;&apos;&apos;    &apos;        ,&quot;&apos;&apos;::.v &apos;.&apos;: 7;&apos;&apos;  .:7237.   PjW. Article 6 - deals with personal effects in possession of aprisoners of war at the time of capture.   The recommendations of the1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts oall for no oomment.  (See also paragraph 426 below)238.   P.W. Artiole 1 - Transfers from one plaoe to another - see part iv*-Vor transfers from one Power to another see paragraphs 72to 80 and 231 above,   see also paragraphs 266 to 269 below.239j   p. w. Artiole 8 - is unnecessary in view of Artioles 36 and 77-
240.   P.W. Artiole 9 - regulates the general oharaoter and situation pfinternment camps.   The 1947 Geneva-Conference of Government experts recommended that the Artiole be strengthened and made more elastic,and in particular:-(a)- that the right to intern prisoners of war in tentedcamps, subject to climatic conditions permitting, be embodied in the Convention;(b) that it be emphasised that prisoners of way may be interned only on land, to guard against the use ofhulk ships;(c) that protective shelters be provided to an equal degreewith those provided for the looal civilian population;(d) that belligerents should exchange information regardingthe location of prisoner of war camps, and that suohcamps be distinctively marked by day for the informationof aircraft;(e) that explicit provision for liberty on parole be embodied:the grant of parole is at present governed by Articles 10,11 and 12 of the Annexe regarding the Laws and Customs ofWar to the Hague Convention of 18th October, 1907, Artioles4 to 9 and 13 to 20 of that Annexe having been superseded the 1929 Geneva Prisoners of War Convention - seeparagraph 11 above).241.   My Committee recommend general approval for the proposals of the1947 Geneva Conference with the following addition:-&quot;PrisonsJtfs 9? war of the same nationality may be segregatedfrom one. another in the interests of their own safety and well-being.&quot;   (C.H.G.C./1i(47)4, Item 29)This would authorise suoh segregation as that of Nazis from non-Nazis,which we practised in the Second World War, and which, without some special provision,- might be argued to be contrary to the general provisionso*f the Convention.242.   With regard to paragraph 240(d) above my Committee were informedthat.the Air Staff would have no objection to the distinctive markingof prisoner of war camps b% night as well as by day.    (C. H.G. C.yM(47)4,Item 29(c)243.   P.W. Article 10 - Accommodation.   The 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts recommended strengthening this Artiole by provisions:-(a) that the accommodation should be as favourable as thatof the forces of the Detaining Power in the same district(this would replace the old Article requiring that itshould be the same as for &quot;depot troops&quot; - a definitionwhioh proved to have little objective meaning);(b) that accommodation should also take into account mannersand customs of the prisoners of war concerned, and notbe prejudicial to their health; ,     ,(c) that dormitories, furniture, bedding, blankets shouldbe sufficient to ensure the well-being and health-ofprisoners of war;(d) that aooommodation should be properly heated and lighted&quot;especially between nightfall and-lights out&quot;.The recommendation under (b) and (o) above were designed to meet thewidely different needs of prisoners of war from different cultures andclimates (e.g. the contrasting needs of United Kingdom and central african troops).    &apos;244.. - Acfapjamodation in Transit Camps.   Two important new provisions
were recommended by the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Expertsfor transit camps, viz:- .. A(a) - that their accommodation should be as similar as possibleto that laid down for permanent camps;(b) that prisoners of war should stay in transit camps for asshort a period as possible.These provisions may give rise to pressure for immediate steps to provideadequately for large numbers of prisoners of war in periods immediately following capture.   Difficulties were experienced in the Second world war, by all belligerents, in the days and weeks immediately followingcapture, in coping with large numbers of prisoners (e.g. by the Germansat Dunkirk, Italians in North Africa, Allied Forces in North and EastAfrica, North West Europe, etc.) and it is difficult to see any remedy for this situation which would not impose very severe handicaps on a victorious belligerent.   For this reason the recommendations regardingtransit oamps are &quot;as possible&quot;. &apos;1245*   My Committee recommend acceptance of the recommendations of the1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts regarding accommodation(see paragraphs 245 and 244 above). (CsR.G.C../.l(47)4, Item 29)246.   P.W. Artiole 11 - Food.   The first paragraph of this Article inthe 1929 Prisoners of War Convention requires prisoners of war to befed on the same basis as &quot;depot troops&quot; of the Detaining Power.   Apart,from doubt as to the meaning of the term &quot;depot troops&quot; the applicationof this Article had, &quot;for different reasons, unsatisfactory results forBritish prisoners both&apos;in German and Japanese hands.247.   At the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts the UnitedStates delegation proposed an elaborate Article setting out in detail thefood values to be provided in the ration for prisoners of war;   butthey withdrew this proposal beoause the general view of the conference was that such an Article would have little meaning in many of the countries where prisoners of war might be detained.   The 1347 Geneva Conferencefinally recommended that&quot;The food rations shall be sufficient in quality, quantity and variety to keep prisoners of war in good health and toprevent loss of weight.   Account shall also be taken of- the habitual diet of prisoners of war.&quot;248.   I should record, however, that the International Red Crossrepresentatives were most unhappy at the absence from the Article, as recommended by the 1947 Conference (see paragraph 247 above) of anyObjective standard with whioh their visiting delegates oould press the Detaining Power to; comply;   and they would have preferred a comparison with some specified troops of the Detaining Power, (e.g.camp staffs or guard troops) or a minimum number of calories(representatives of the Swiss Government were not present and theConference was without the views of their experience as protecting power).   The 1947 Conference clearly felt that troops actively employed,either as camp staffs or guard troops, might require a larger rationthan non-working prisoners of war;   and that, in any case, a rationappropriate to certain races (e.g. Japanese) would be entirelyunsuitable for the foroes of other races.   The 1947 Geneva Conferencerejeoted a calory standard beoause of the practical difficulty of its application in the camps.249.   The formula finally recommended is not claimed absolutely seoure;but the I947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts were satisfiedthat it stated as clearly and as explicitly as was practicable, what should be required of a Detaining Power.   My Committee recommendsJaooeptance of the recommended formula..   (C.R.G.C./l,l(47)4, Item 30)250.   Food may&apos; be the subject of further detailed consideration ata future International Conference;   and I suggest that the UnitedKingdom delegation, whilst supporting the text recommended by the1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts, should be at liberty to oonstter modifications so long as they would not weaken the specific
references to: -(a) good health of the prisoners;(b) weight of the prisoners;(c) normal diet of the prisoners;and axlow the Protecting Power and the International Red Cross Committeevisitors to press for differences in diet to meet the differing needs,customs and habits of prisoners of war from different countries.251.   Ho amendments are proposed in the remaining paragraphs&quot;of Article 11of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention, which-deal with facilities for preparing food, the provision of drinking water, the use of tobacco andbanning collective disciplinary measures affecting food.252.   P.W. article 12 - Clothing, Underwear, Footwear and Canteens.   The1947 Geneva Conference recouauended that this Article should be divided,the provisions relating to canteens being carried to a separate Article.So far as clothing etc. is concerned, the 1947 Conference recommendedtwo new requirements, viz:-(a) that the Detaining Power should take into account theclimatic conditions under which prisoners of war weredetained;(b) that uniforms of the forces in which the prisoners ofwar were serving when captured, whioh come into thehands of the Detaining Power, should be used to clotheprisoners of war from those forces.My Committee recommend approval of&apos;the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment -i^xperts regarding olothing, footwear and underwear.(C.R.G.C./i.-(47)4, Item 31)253.   Canteens.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended that the existing provisions:-(a) that there should be canteens in all camps;(b) that food commodities and ordinary articles shouldbe available in canteens at local market prices;should be maintained;   but that the provision in the 1929 Prisonersof .Var Convention that canteen profits are to be used for the benefitof the prisoners of war, should be expanded by new requirements:-(c) that the profits should go to a &quot;welfare fund&quot;;(d) that the Camp Leader should have the right toparticipate in the management of the canteen and shallsit on the Managing&quot; Committee of the &quot;welfare fund&quot;;and have the right to check the account book and be consulted &quot;about sharing profits;(e) that &quot;welfare funds&quot; may be used for the benefit ofprisoners of war of the same nationality;(f) that the final decision regarding the use of the final-balance of &quot;welfare funds&quot; should be for the detaining power.254.   The recommendations referred to in paragraph 253(c) *o (f)above are proper to the financial section but have been set out herein order to complete the picture, so far as canteens are concerned.L..y Committee recommend approval of the- recommendations referred toJin paragraph 253(0) to (f).

This Article deals with two distinct questions:-(a) the responsibility for authority in camps;(b) the marks of respect to be paid to officers of the detaining Power.With regard to the authority in any oamp, the 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts recommended: -(a) that the Commandant must be a commissioned officer ofthe Detaining Power (this would stop the practice of putting WoCOs. in charge of camps);(b) that the Commandant must be responsible for all thework detachments belonging to the Camp, as well as for the camp itself;(c) that he must see that the camp staff and guards areacquainted with the provisions of the Convention.259.   Saluting by prisoners of war gave rise to some difficult questions in the last war, and the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Expertsthat prisoners of war should use&quot;the salute belongingto their own foroes and not that appropriate to theforces of the Detaining Power;that officers should salute only officers of the detaining Power of superior rank (the Final Reportof the 1947 Conference issued by the International red cross Committee retains the provision that they shouldalso salute officers of the Detaining Power of equalrank);that officers must salute the Commandant of the oampwhether &quot;of superior rank or not.i2oQ.

P.W. Article 25 deals with the transfer of wounded and sicicprisoners of war from one camp to another and prohibits such transfersif their recovery might be prejudiced by the journey (for transfers ofhealthy prisoners of war see paragraphs 266 and 269 below).. The 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended that this Articleshould require that transfer should be carried out:-(a) only in case of absolute necessity;(b) in humane fashion;(c) only if not prejudicial to the health of the sick.My Committee did not approve (a) above.   Its purpose is to prevent sickor wounded in hospital from being moved until they have sufficientlyreoovered to.leave hospital;   but my Committee observed that thelimitation of movement to cases of absolute necessity might! preventmovement to another hospital or a plaoe of convalescence, where thatwould be desirable in the interests of the prisoner but not &quot;necessary&quot;.It would also rule out movement of partially reoovered sick and wounded to a hospital where they could be more securely watched, evenin oases where it was clear that their health would not in any waysuffer from a journey under proper conditions,    (dee paragraphs 72 to60 above, for transfers between Powers; and paragraphs 81 to 83 fortransfers when the &quot;fighting front&quot; approaches.)267.   Por the reasons set out in paragraph 266 above, my committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international conference should resist recommendation (a) in its &quot;absolute&quot; form:my Committee recommend acceptance of (b) and (o) of paragraph 266 above.(C.ii.G.C./ii(48)3, Item 20)   (see also paragraph 385 beiowj.268.   P.W. Article 26 deals with&apos; the transfer i&apos;rom one camp toanother of prisoners of war in health (for transfers of wounded andsiok see paragraphs 266 and 26? above).   The 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts recommended certain additional provisions whichraise no controversial issues.   They include a minimum weight of personal belongings which a prisoner of war may take with him ontransfer.   A proposal by the International iied Cross Committee toimpose special conditions for the movement of prisoners of war by sea was rejected by the 1947 Conference.   (See paragraphs 72 to 80above for transfers between Powers;   and paragraphs 81 to 83 fortransfers when the &quot;fighting front&quot; approaches).269.   My Committee reoommend acceptance of the recommendations ofthe 1947 Conference;   and that the minimum weight of personaleffects allowed to be taken by a prisoner of war from one camp toanother should be 25 kilograms (approximately -g- cwt.);   but that,the Detaining Power should transport all other personal effects assoon as possible after the transfer of the prisoners of war, towhom they belong. (See also paragraph 385 below).270.   P.W. Artiole 27 - Employment on Work - General Conditions.   Underthe 1929 Prisoners of War Convention, officers are free from any obligation to work and non-commissioned officers are under obligationto work only on supervision.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts recommended:-(a)   a new preamble indicating that prisoners of war may beemployed on work for which they are physically fit       ^&quot;in order to maintain their physical and mental fitness ;&quot;   (b)   that regard should be had to age, sex, rank and physical capacities;(c)   that fitness for work should be verified by periodicalmedical examination;
that prisoners of war who are victims of acoident or -disease arising from work: should receive all necessary .oare and: also a &quot;iriedioal cert ificato showing the nat ureand causes of the-disability;   a oopy of this certificateto be sent to the Powsr in whose forces the prisoner ofwar was serving when captured, through the internation red Cress Committee.   The certifioate should perhaps besent, not through the International Red Cross committee as such, but through the Protecting Power or alternativelythrough the Central Agency which, though run by theInternational Red Cross Committee, is, in principle,an independent organisation.   (See Artiole 79)271.   Article 27 of the 1$29 Prisoners of War Convention also requiredcompensation for injuries at work to be dealt with under the Workmen&apos;compensation legislation of the Detaining Power:   these provisions provedunworkable - see paragraphs 108(g) and 113 above for what is proposed for the future.1272.   My Committee recommend acceptance of the recommendations set.out in paragraph 270 above.   (C. R. G. C./hi(47)5, Item 39;   C. R. G. 0./L (48)3,Item. 22),273.   P.W. Article 28 deals with the responsibility for prisoners ofwar working for private individuals.   The 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts recommended that the Article be clarified and, inparticular, that it should provide for prisoners of war working for private employers to maintain contact with their. Camp Leader in theIbase camp.   My Committee recommend approval of these recommendations.(C.R,G.C./fo(47)5, Item 39)274.   P.W. Artiole 29 deals with physical fitness for work.   The 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended that prisoners ofwar who feel unfit, for work should have a special right to apply for medical examination and, also, that prisoner of war medical officers should be allowed to recommend exemption from work for prisoners ofwar they consider unfit.    (See also paragraph 270(c) above).   my committee accepted these recommendations.295.   P.-W.   Article 30 - Hours of work.   The 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts recommended:-that prisones of war be granted a break of one hour inthe middle of a day&apos;s work as well as 24 hours continuousrest in each week.    (This provision may create difficulties for some of the United Kingdom user departments;   in viewof its importance for the proteotion of British prisonersof war, the Departments concerned have withdrawn their objection to it);eight days paid rest after a continuous year&apos;s work;that hours of work should not be rendered excessive bythe use of piece work.    (This is to guard against theabuse of task work).My Committee, reinforced by representatives of &quot;user&quot; Departments,recommend approval of these recommendations.    (C.R.G. C./4l(48)7, Item 51)276. , P.W. Artiole 31 deals with the kind of work on which a prisoner of war may be employed - see paragraphs 62 to 71 above.277.   P.W.

260.   P.W. Article 35 - Publication of measures for execution of theConvention - see Part IV -281.   P.W. Article 36 - Letters and postcards.   Three important changes were recommended for consideration by the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts.   The first recommendation v.ould provide:-that all letter post should be carried by the most rapidmeans.This would generally mean airmail which, in the view of theGeneral Post Office and the air ministries, would often be impracticable,in wartime, because aircraft could not be spared:the insertion of these words was deliberately meant to makeair transport obligatory, in order to avoid the hazards ofland and sea transport arising from modem warfare operations.My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should seek to modify this recommend-atiOn:   they do hot recommend that the use of airmail be ruled out,but that there should be no obligation to provide it.   (C.R.G.C./k(47)3Item 16(a).   During the Second World War, by mutual agreement,prisoners of war mails between Germany and England went betweenLisbon and Germany by air.282. The second of the recommended changes referred to in paragraph 281above would provide: -that each prisoner of war should have a right to send aminimum number of two lettei&apos;s and four postcards monthly:the General Post Office and Censorship are opposed tothis provision in view of the impossible strain it would impose, in the event of large numbers of prisoners of warbeing Captured, or of prisoners of war from a country, in whose language we were short of interpreters.The United States delegation are likely to press strongly forminima, in view of the almost complete failure of the japanese to provide any regular correspondence facilities for prisonersof war in their hands;   but it is at least open to doubt whether any Western Power could.have provided an outwardservice of two letters and four postcards a month, forhundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war if it had had so many in its hands;   unless that Power had been preparedto forego almost entirely, censorship control.ily Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should resist the insertion of minimumnumbers in the Convention;   but that if they have to give way theyshould seek a formula whioh would condition the minima to thedifficulty of censorship, where there are language difficulties forthe Detaining Power, and press that any belligerent should be free to modify the minima by giving notice to that effect to the adversebelligerent concerned.    (C. R. G. C. /M(47)3, Item 16)283.   The third of the recommended changes referred to in paragraph 281wouldintroduce a standard model postcard as an annexe to the *Convention.Suoh a card would have some advantages;   but it might encourageDetaining Powers to seek to limit prisoners of war to suchpostcards.My Committee -considered that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should seek to preserve as great freedom aspossible for prisoners of war to write a3 they choose;   and thatresort to a standard card be allowed only in extreme conditions.(C.R.G.C./M(47)3, Item l )
284.   P.W. Artiole 37 - Right to receive parcels. - see paragraphs115 to 120 above. - V/ith referenoe to paragraph 119 above, theregulations recommended by the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government   1 QExperts to be annexed to the Convention are set out in detail in- - .    &quot;C.Ii.G. J./p(47)32.   They would provide hat Camp Leaders should begiven all essential facilities for ohecking supplies received, for controlling and supervising their distribution&apos;, in labour detachmentsas well as in base camps, and for the holding of stocks of supplj.es,and for proper accommodation for suoh stocks, in cair-p.   They also provide for the Camp Leader to be able to correspond freely aboutsuoh supplies with the Protecting Power and the International red cross Committee;   and for representatives of these to be given all necessary facilities.285.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts furtherrecommended embodiment in the Convention of the following principles:-(a) that the Camp Leader should have the right to distributeand dispose of relief supplies and that he must be giventhe necessary facilities;(b) that the receipt of collective consignments does notrelieve the Detaining Power of any of its obligations(this particularly refers to food, clothing and medioalsupplies);(c) that the representative of the Protecting Power, theInternational Red Cross Committee, or other neutralintermediary, should have the right to supervise thedistribution of collective consignments;(d) that prisoners of war have right to receive collectiveconsignments, subject only to such reasonablerestrictions as may be proposed by the protecting power or some other competent international body(but see also paragraph 118(a) above);(e) that both Detaining Powers and Transit countries should Garry collective supplies free by rail, andsuch supplies -should be exempt from any charges forcustoms, registration,, import duties, etc. (See alsoparagraphs 123 and 125 above).286.   My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation toa future International Conference should support the recommendationsreferred to in paragraphs .284 and 285 above.    (C.R.G.C./:.l(48)l,Items 5 and 6) (See also paragraphs 115 to 120, 123 and 125 above).287.   P.W. Artiole 38 deals with the exemption of letters and parcelsaddressed to prisoners, of war, from postal charges, taxes, importduties and railway charges; and with telegrams.   The 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts recommended that this Article shouldspecifically cover collective, as well as individually addressed,paroels and should provide that all should be free of any kind of tax,import duty or similar charge;   and that individually addressed postalpackets or parcels should be carried free through all the countries who are parties to the Convention.   This latter recommendation accordswith the International Postal and Parcels Conventions.   (For transportof collective parcels see paragraphs 121 to 138 above).288.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended the&quot;strengthening of the provisions in Article 38 of the 1929Prisoners of War Convention allowing prisoners of war to send telegramsat their own expense to require that:-(a) where there are no facilities for postal packets;   or(b) where prisoners of war and their families are separatedby long distances (e.g. British prisoners of war in theFar East);prisoners of -war should have the right to send telegrams.
289.   My Committee reoommend chat the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference, should support the recommendations[referred to in paragraphs 287 and 288 above.    (See also paragraphs125, 134 and 138 above).    (C.R.G. C./M(4S)l, Items 5 and 6 andC.R.G.C./M(47)3, Item 16, 17 and 18)290.   There is much to be said for including in the Prisoners ofWar Convention speoifio provision for sending standard-telegraphicmessages on the lines which National Red Cross Societies weredeveloping towards the end of the Second &quot;World War, and whichoperated reasonably effectively, for civilian internees.   Nospeoifio recommendation on the subject was made by the 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts;   but more may be heard of thissuggestion at a future International Conference, and I suggestthat the United Kingdom delegation should examine any proposal inthis direction with sympathy, as well as care.291.   P.W. Artiole 39 deals with the right of prisoners of war toreceive books;   but recognises that they must be submitted tocensorship.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended that this Article should cover also Articles requiredfor religious service, musical instruments, games, equipment and materials required for study or art work and soientifio equipment.All these things were, in fact, sent to British prisoners &quot;of war inGermany and Italy through the British Red Cross War Organisationduring the Second World War, but this would formally authorise what,&quot;in praotioe, was done*   Specific mention is not made of examinationpapers and it might be desirable to include these.   Many british prisoners of war in Europe acquired recognised educational and professional qualifications, through passing examinations whilst theywere prisoners of war.   My Committee accepted these recommendations.292.   P.W. Article 40 deals with oensorship of correspondence.   The1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts reoommended that prisonersof war correspondence, etc., should be censored only in the sendingand receiving stages, and not in the intermediate stages (e.g. byneutrals).   The Government of India delegate proposed that wherebelligerents had not a sufficient number of interpreters in any languagethey should seek to obtain additional censors from neutral countries -or from the International Red Cross Committee.   The representative ofthe Security Servioe advised toy Committee that this proposal should be strongly resisted.   My Committee aocepted the recommendation of theConference and recommend that the proposals of the Government of india should be resisted.    (C.R.G.C./k(47)3, Item 19). .293.   P.W.

Articles 45to 67 of the 1929 Prisoners of War. Convention deal with discipline and Judicial proceedings and punishments;   and the major questions arising thereon have already been considered in paragraphs 96 to104 above.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended that these Articles should be re-arranged, ,and my committee, on the advice of the Sub-Committee referred to in paragraph96 above, have accepted this recommendation, and themselves recommendan expansion and re-arrangement of the whole chapter.   To make their recommendations intelligible it is neoessary to deal with this chapterin the new order and not in the order of the Articles of the 1929Convention.   The number of the corresponding Artiole in the 1929Convention is shown in brackets after the new number of the Articlenow recommended and to facilitate reference a comparative table ofArticles, showing their numbers in the 1929 Prisoners of war convention and as now reoommended is given in paragraph

(C.R.G.C./k(48)10, ltem.70)I 2.6.   P.W. Artiole 46.   niy Committee recommend a new Artiole dealing withthe punishments of women prisoners of war, re-affirming, in particularrelation to punishments, the general principle that women should not betreated less favourable, at any time, than men.    (See also paragraphs 92and 234 above, and 298, 354 and 383 below).    (C.R.G. C./M(48)10, Item 71)General Principles governing Punishments297.   P.W. Artiole 47 (46)&quot;*&apos;   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended an additional provision that prisoners of war should be tried bythe same courts as members of the forces of the Detaining Power, in orderto exclude special (and perhaps non-military) tribunals being set up to tryprisoners of war only.298.   iuy Committee reoommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should support the recommendation referred to inparagraph 297 above;   and that they should propose another additional provision that&quot;Women prisoners of war undergoing punishment shall be confined in separate premises from men and shall be underthe immediate supervision of women&quot;   (C.R.G.C./wl(48)l0, Item 72)299.   P.W.

The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts reoommended the omission of the words in inverted commas above and my Committee recommendapproval of this recommendation.    (C. R. G.

The representative of the ncme Office reminded my Committee that thereis no authority in the United Kingdom for the deduction from a sentenoeby a civil court of a period spent in arrest.   My Committee took note ofthi3 fact;   but did not consider their recommendation should be modifiedon that account, having regard to the need for safeguarding british prisoners of war in enemy hands.(a)(b)(c)(a)
-301.   P.W. Artiole 49 (48)*   The 1929 Prisoners of War Conventionprovides that a prisoner of war having undergone his judicialpunishment, shall then not be treated differently from otherprisoners of war;   but allows for &quot;regimes of surveillanoe&quot; for prisoners of war after punishment for attempted escape.302.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommendedadditional provision that a &quot;regime of surveillance&quot; (see paragraph301 above) should not affect a prisoner&apos;s physical or mental well-being and should be carried out onxy in a prisoner of war camp.Iany Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should support this recommendation.(C.R.G.C./M(48)10, Item 72(g) and 82)303.   P.W. Artiole 50 (49 paragraph l)*   The -1929 Prisoners of ,arConvention prohibits deprivation of rank by a Detaining Power.The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts reoommended thatthis provision should cover badges of rank also;   and my CommitteeIreoommend approval of this recommendation and that it be extendedto cover badges of nationality also.    (C. H.G. C./ivi(46) 10, Item 72(h))304.   P.W. Artiole 51 (52 paragraph l)*   requires &quot;the greatestleniency&quot; in considering whether an offence shall be dealt withdisoiplinarily or judicially, particularly for offences inconnection with escapes.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts recommended that the provision regarding offences in connection with escapes should be expanded.   My Committee reoommend(approval of this recommendation.    (C.R.G. C./M(48)10, Ite.i. 72 (k)305.   P.W.   Artiole 52 (67)* prohibits deprivation of rights of complaint (see Article 42) and pr. Iff.. Artiole 53 (52 paragraph 2Y+ punishment more than once for thesame offence.   No questions arise on either of these Artioles.Disciplinary Provisions306.   P.W. Artiole 54 (47 paragraph l)* . The 1929 Prisoners of sVarConvention provides for a statement of relevant faots to be givenin writing to, a prisoner of war accused of a breach of discipline,and for the period in custody pending investigation to be reducedto a minimum.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended certain additional provisions to protect a prisoner ofwar during the period in custody pending investigation and decisionof the case.   My Committee reoommend approval of these recommend-ations;   and that the United Kingdom delegation to a future Inter-national Conference should propose that a reoord of disciplinarypunishments awarded should be maintained by Camp. Commandants andthat it should be open to inspection by the Protecting Power.(C.R.G.C./k(48)lO, Item 73)307.   P.W. Artiole 55 (59)*   The 1929 Prisoners of ,/ar Conventionlimits exercise of disciplinary powers to a Camp Commandant orthe officer acting as his substitute.   The 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts recommended that it should be made clear that the substitute must be an officer; that disciplinary powers could not be delegated to prisoners of war;   and that detailed provisions should be added ensuring adequate opportunity to defendhimself to the accused prisoner of war, and for the Camp Leadero be present.   My Committe.e reoommend approval of these recommend-tionsl    (CR.G. C./M(48) 10, Item&apos; 73)3O8.   P.v/. Article 56-(50)*   The. 1929 Prisoners of .Var Conventionprovides for disciplinary punishment only for an unsuccessful escape;and prohibits punishment for a successful escape, if subsequentlytaken prisoner of war again.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts recommended(a) that a definition of &quot;successful escape&quot; be embodied in the article;(b) that it include a prohibition against the uae of armsexcept to prevent escape or enforce order;    and then only as a last report and after warning.-i- see paragraph 294
My Committee reoommend that the United Kingdom delegation to      - -future International Conference should support these recommendations&apos;and that a prisoner of war should be considered as having -feuccessfullvesoaped&quot;:-(a) on his reaching territory not occupied by the detaining Power or any of its allies;(b) on rejoining his own armed foroes or those ofan Allied Power;(o)   on reaching the high seas;(d)   on boarding, in the territorial waters of the detaining Power, a merchant vessel or warshipflying the flag of his own oountry or of an AlliedPower, and which is not under, the oommand of the detaining Power.(G.R.G-.G./M(48)10, Item 74J309.   P.W. Artiole 57 (51)* provides that attempted esoapw shallnot be aggravation of a charge for offences against person or property;and that comrades assisting an escape or attempted escape shall be liable to disciplinary punishment only.   No questions arise on thisArtiole.310.   P.W. Artiole 58 (54)*  The 1929 Prisoners of .Var Conventionprovides that imprisonment is the most severe disciplinary punishment,30 days is the maximum punishment, even if charged at the same time with more than one orfence, and that at least 3 days must elapsebetween any two sentences for 10 days or more.   No questions arise on this Artiole.311.   P.W. Article 59 (49(2), 56(4), 57(1), 58) *  These scatteredprovisions of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention deal with rightsof prisoners of war undergoing disciplinary punishment.   My Committeereoommend that they should be consolidated into one Article as setout below, (b) and (f) being new provisions :-&quot;Prisoners of war will be accorded the following rightseven when undergoing disciplinary punishment:-(a) they shall not be deprived of the privileges oftheir rank:   in particular, offioers and persons of equivalent status who suffer penalties entailingdeprivation of.liberty shall not be placed in thesame premises as non-commissioned officers or private soldiers undergoing punishment;(b) they shall be entitled to transmit complaints to,,and to be visited on demand by the Protecting Power;(o)   they shall have facilities every day for takingexercise:: or for remaining out of doors for at. least two hours;(d) they shall be permitted to read and write and tosend and receive letters;(e) they shall be permitted at their request to presentthemselves for daily medioal inspection.   They shall receive such medioal attention as their healthrequires and if need be shall be evacuated to aoamp infirmary or to hospital;(f) they shall be permitted to attend divine services in accordance with the tenets of their faith.&quot;(C.

Artiole 60 (55)   permits punishment diets for prisoners ofwar undergoing disciplinary punishment, but suoh diets are permissibleonxy if the state of the prisoner&apos;s health permits&quot;.   The 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts were doubtful about thisArtiole, but these powers have been,found necessary in dealing with enemy prisoners of war in United Kingdom hands during the Second&quot;World War.313*   My Committee therefore recommend(a) retention of permission for use of punishment diets;(b) that, to protect British prisoners of war in enemyhands, the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should seek to introduce aminimum standard based on the punishment diets auth-orised in the United Kingdom.(C.H.G.C./ll(48)l3, Item 97(o))314.   P.W. Artiole 6&quot;! is a new Artiole setting out permissibledisciplinary punishments.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts reoomasnded that suoh an Artiole should be embodied in anew Convention, but did not propose any particular text.   my committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should propose:-(a) that disciplinary punishments should be limited toone of the following:-(i)   forfeiture of pay not exceeding 14 days pay(see paragraph 108(b) above);(ii)   imprisonment under Article 58 (see paragraph310 above);(iii)   fatigue duties over and above the prisoner&apos;snormal work, not exceeding 2 hours a day for14 consecutive days:   officers and non-commissioned officers not to be subjected tothis punishment;(b) prisoners of war undergoing imprisonment may be.. deprived of the right to smoke and make purchases atthe canteen;   unless they are offioers or seniornon-commissioned offioersthey may be employed onnormal work without pay, for the Detaining Power butnot for a private employer, for periods not exceeding9 hours a day, unless they are on a punishment diet(see paragraph 313 above) or&quot;are certified by a medioalofficer as unfit for work;(o)   prisoners of war who commit an offence whilst under-going disciplinary punishment may be awardedpunishment diet (see paragraph 313 above).(C.R.G.C./M(48)13, Item 97(c))315.   P.W. Article 62 (56, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3)* The 1929 Prisonersof War Convention lays down that disciplinary punishments must notbe carried out in prisons, and that the places where they are carriedout must conform to hygienic requirements.   My Committee, followinggenerally the recommendations of the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts, recommend revision of this article to ensurethat disciplinary punishments are carried out only in prisoners ofwar camps, that hygienic and other requirements of health are met,land that sentences should run from the date of the award;   but thatEf other delegations, at a future International Conference, pressIf or provision to* be made for an interval between award and cominence-bent of sentence, the United kingdom delegation should accept theRecommendation of the 1947 Conference that this interval should notExceed one month.

The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommendedspeoifio provision that the period in custody&apos;awaiting trial should notexceed 3 months,   My Committee reoommend approval of this recommendation;and also that the Article should provide that:-&quot;a prisoner of war awaiting trial shall not:-(a) be confined in any other place than a prisoner of war oamp;officers and persons of equivalent rank shall not be detained in the same premises as non-commissioned officers or other ranks;(b) , be segregated from other prisoners of war except so faras security, the maintenance of discipline, or his safecustody renders absolutely necessary;(c) be deprived of any of his rights or privileges under thepresent Convention except so far as security and his safecustody and the maintenance of order renders essential;and shall:-(d) be allowed all reasonable facilities for preparing hisdefence and for this purpose shall be allowed to consult hislegal advisers, the representative of the Protecting-Power,the prisoner of war spokesman, or another prisoner of warwhom he wishes to assist with his defence, at all reasonabletimes at his or their request.&quot;(C.R.G.C./M(48)10, Item 76 (a) and (b)and C.R.G.C./M(48)13, Item 97(d)).318.   P.W. Artiole 65 (60)* provides for the notification to the protecting power of judicial proceedings and the details to be included in suohnotification.   My Committee, following generally the recommendations ofthe 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts, reoommend that theUnited Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should propose certain changes in the details to be required;   and that copiesof the notification should be handed to the accused prisoner of war andto the Camp Leader.    (C.R.G.C./M(48)lO, Item 76(c))319.   P.W. Article 66 (6l)*  provides that no prisoner of war shall besentenced without being given an opportunity to defend himself and shallnot be subjected to pressure to induce him to admit guilt.   No questionsarise on this Artiole.   (C.R. G.C./M(48)10   Item 76(e))320.   P.W. Artiole 67 (62)* The 1929 Prisoners of War Convention sets out certain provisions regarding defending oounsel for accused prisoners ofwar and gives representatives of the Protecting Power the right to attend(a)(b)

My Committee recommend that &quot;serious charges&quot; under paragraph 320above might be describsd as including oharges for which the minimumpenalty is more than three years imprisonment or on which complicatedissues of law are likely to arise.    (C.R.G.C./M(48)12, Item 92(b))322.   P.W. Article 67A (63)*  The 1929 Prisoners of War Conventionprovides that sentence should be pronounced only by the sametribunals and under the same prooedure as for persons belonging tothe armed foroes of the Detaining Power.   The 1947 Geneva-Conferenceof Government Experts recommended that this Artiole should also provide:-(a) that no judgment passed against a prisoner of war should be valid unless the provisions of theConvention had been complied with by the detaining power;.(b) that certain essential rights should be specificallyreserved for prisoners of war undergoing judicialsentences.My Committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should support both these recommendations,and, in particulars, should seek to preserve for &apos; &amp;Lprisoner of warundergoing a judicial sentence the right to be visited by the protecting Power.   My Committee attach the greatest importance tothis last provision which is designed to enable the power, in whose .Service the prisoner of war.was at the time of Rapture, to ascertain from time to time, from the independent observation of the ProtectisgPower, how he is being treated*   (C.R.G.G./te(48)10, Item 77)323.   P.W. Article 67B.   This is a new Artiole which, followinggenerally the recommendation of the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts, my Committee recommend to provide that judicialsentences should be served under conditions not less favourable than those applicable to soldiers of the Detaining, Power undergoingsentences for similar offences;   and that, where the judicial sentenceis for an offence against a regulation peculiar to prisoners of war as such, the sentence should be undergone in a place conforming tothe conditions for disciplinary punishments.-&apos;. (See paragraph 315 above).This new Artiole would include oertain other detailed provisionsregarding the conditions under whioh prisoners of war should servejudicial sentences.    (C.R. G.C./M(48)10, Item 77),&apos;.*24.   P.W. Artiole 670 (64)*  The 1929 Prisoners of War Conventionprovides that a prisoner of war shall have the right to appeal against any judicial sentence against him.   My Committee recommend that theArticle should also provide that proceedings on appeals should besubject, generally 4 to the same provisions as laid down in theConvention for the^original judicial proceedings (see paragraphs 317to 322 above).    (C.R.G.C./M(48)10, Item 78 and C.R.G.C./M(48)13,Item 97(e))
525.   iJ.&apos;V. Artiole 6 TP (65)   provides that a sentence pronouncedagainst a prisoner of war be ootomunioated iaanediately to the Protecting .power.   My Committee, following the recouuuendation of the 1947 geneva conference of. Government ilxperts recommend that this article should be strengthened by requiring that the notification should set out:-(a) the judgment and any reasons adduoed for it;(b) a brief account of the proceedings stressing thearguments for the defence;(o)   information regarding the place where the sentenceis to be served.(C.R.G.C./m(48)10, Item 79)326.   P.W. Artiole 67B (66)*&apos; The 1929 Prisoners of V/ar Conventionprovides that particular notification regarding sentences of death andthe oiroumstanoes in which they arise be sent to the Protecting Power;   andfor an interval of not less than three months between the date of thereceipt of this notification by the Protecting Power and execution ofsentenoe.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommendedthat the necessary notification to the Protecting Power should be coveredby the preoeeding Article (see paragraph 325 above);   that the interval before execution of sentence should be increased to six months;   and that prisoners of war should be notified as soon as practicable after capture,and the Protecting Powers should also be informed, of the offences subjectto capital punishment under the laws of the Detaining Power.327.   Experience during the Second World War demonstrated that an intervalft three months was not always adequate, even as between the Unitedingdom and Germany, for an account of the proceedings to reach the prisoners &quot;&quot;home&apos; douhtry, for their study there, and for any consideredrepresentations in reply to reach the Detaining Power;   and in the lightof that experience my Committee support the proposal to increase the interval to six months,   in a number of cases the representations made bythef United Kingdom through the Protecting Power succeeded in postponingindefinitely execution.of death sentences on British prisoners of war in enemy hands, with the result that the prisoners of war in question wererepatriated with their comrades in due course.   A lengthy interval betweenthe passing and execution of a death sentence in the United Kingdom (ifsuspension of capital punishment were not the rule) would create someadministrative difficulties for the Prison Commissioners, if the fullprecautions normally taken with a prisoner under sentence of death were tobe observed for the whole period;   but it is understood that there wouldbe no insuperable difficulty in accepting the obligation now recommendedprovided that these special precautions were relaxed and&apos;that this would,no doubt, be done by the Prison Commissioners if need arose.323.   My Committee reoommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should support the recommendations of the 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts referred to in paragraph 326 above.(C.E.G,C./tt(48)lO, Item 80).   Mr. Strutfs Committee on the proposedCivilian Convention is repommending that the interval before the exeoutionof a death sentence should be six months.    (See paragraph 219 above) (see also paragraphs 102 to 104 above)329.

Artiole 6*8 deals with repatriation or transfer to a neutral country of seriously ill or wounded.   Under the 1929 Prisoners of war convention the operation of this Artiole depended on agreements between belligerents regarding the classes of disablement or sicknesswhioh would qualify a prisoner of war for repatriation or transfer to a neutral country;   but a draft model agreement annexed to theConvention, was, in practice, accepted as between the UnitedKingdom on the one hand and Germany and Italy on the other.   no agreement was reached with Japan.331*   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommendedembodying broad definitions of those who should be repatriateddirectly and of those who may be hospitalised, in a neutral country inthe Artiole, whilst leaving belligerents free to agree other definitionsif they choose.   The definitions recommended by the 1947 Conference tobe embodied in the Convention have been accepted by the medicalauthorities of the three Service Departments;   and they have alsoapproved the draft model agreement, as recommended by the 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts, subject to a few amendments in detail.332.   The United States delegation proposed that hospitalisation in a neutral country, of the appropriate classes, should be obligatory onbelligerents; &quot;but the 1947 Conference turned down the proposal,taking the view that the obligation could not be imposed on a neutralpower until after preliminary negotiations and agreement on the exact terms, financial and otherwise, on whioh such accommodationshould be provided.333*   A proposal to bar the repatriation.of any prisoner of war against his will, was not approved by the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts (see paragraph 90 above).334.   My Committee reoommend that the United Kingdom delegation toa future International Conference should support the recommendationsof the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts referred to inparagraph 331 above.

My Committee reoommend that the repatriation of prisoners ofwar charged with or undergoing sentences for offences, which is dealtwith in Artiole 53 of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention (amongstthe Disciplinary and Judicial Provisions) should be transferred tothis part of the Convention, where other repatriation questions areaovered.(C.R.G.C./,i(48)lO, Items 81 and 82)
339. P. W. ^rticle 76curiously combines provisions regarding themaking of wills, the certification of death, and arrangements forburials and for the care of graves;v. a. Article 77 concerns the collection of information about prisonersof war, the duties of a Prisoners of .7ar Information Bureau, and thedisposal of personal effects of prisoners of war who die in captivityor who escape, are released or repatriated.340.   i-y Commit see considered together:-the two Articles referred to in paragraph 339 above;.&quot;Articles 3 and 4 of the 1929 Red Cross Convention (see paragraphs 335 and 336 below); -thS provisions about information to be given on interrogatiin Artiole 5 of the Prisoners of War Convention (seeparagraph 364 below);identity cards for protected personnel unde: article 21of the 1929 Red Cross Convention (see paragraph 419 below;;identity discs, (see paragraphs 42u and 421 below)and came to the conclusion that:-(x,)   all these provisions needed co-ordination and substantialre-arrangement;(y)   the corresponding provisions in the Prisoners of .&apos;ar andRed Cross Conventions should generally be the same;(z)   the corresponding provisions in the Maritime convention should also odnform, except in so far as conditions at sea justified differences,    (dee Articles 5 and 6 of theproposed Maritime Convention - Appendix B, paragraphs 31. and 32).My Committee^ recommendations will be found in paragraphs 407 to 426 ofPart IV be Low;   exoept on the following points:-The use of Finger-Prints - see paragraphs 204 to 207 aboveViolent Deaths and Serious Injuries - see paragraphs 341 and342 below.341.   Violent Deaths and Serious Injuries.   The 1929 Prisoners of war convention contains no special provisions regarding prisoners of war whoincur serious injuries or die as the result of violence.   During theSeoond World War the United Kingdom agreed with Germany a procedureon the following lines:-(a)   whenever a prisoner of war is killed or seriouslywounded, either by a guard, another prisoner of war,or any other person, the Detaining Power shall at onoeinform the representative of the Protecting power and cause an official enquiry to be held;   a prisoner ofwar shall be regarded as seriously wounded in all caseswhere he has to be admitted as an in-patient to a.hospital or an infirmary;(b.)   at the enquiry, the evidenoe of any other prisoner ofwar who witnessed the accident shall be taken;(o)   when the enquiry is ended, the Detaining Power shallcommunicate to the Protecting Power the findings of thecourt holding the enquiry, and a statement of theevidenoe at the enquiry, including the evidence of anyprisoner of war called as witness;(d)   if the enquiry shows that any person or persons, is(a)O)(a)(fi)
or are culpably responsible for the injury, the- detaining power shall take: steps  or the prosecution of the saidperson or persons.342.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended tnatthe procedure detailed in paragraph 341 above should be stipulated inthe Prisoners of War Convention;   and my Committee reoommend that theUnited Kingdom delegation to a future&quot; International Conference should support this recommendation.

Before dealing with the Articles of the Red Cross ConventionI would recall the general remarks about the background to thisConvention in paragraphs.9 and 10 above.354,   R..0. Artiole 1 provides for the general protection of allwounded and sick  and that they shall be treated with humanity andoared for medically without distinction of nationality.   The 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts reaoaaaendod expansion ofthe &quot;non-differentiation&quot; Clause to provide that wounded and sickshould be treated without any distinction of nationality, religion,race or political opinion;   that women should be treated withrespect due to their sex;   and that this Artiole should embrace all those who could be made prisoners of war under the Prisoners of war convention.   (See paragraphs 225 to 229 above).   The application ofthe Conventions generally to women was considered by a special sub-Committee representing all nursing and women&apos;s services who were generally satisfied (see paragraph 92 above).   My Committee recommendthat the United Kingdom delegation to a future international conference should support these recommendations, subject to an addition,
having in uiind Eastern countries in particular, to ensure that in anyoase women should not be treated worse than men.    ( J. H. G. C./u.(48J4,*Item 30(a) and (b) and C.

The 1947Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended that the Artiole should state specifically that medicalmilitary formations and establishments extending their care to covercivilians would not be deprived of this protection.   This wouldregularise the common practice.   It should perhaps be mentioned here that, under the proposed Civilian Convention, protection, parallel tothat hitherto given exclusively to military medical formations and establishments, would be extended to civil hospitals and they would beallowed to be marked with the Red Cross flag and emblem,   (see paragraphs 177(d), 178(d) and 180 above).   Even if this provision is incorporated in a Convention for the from&amp;otion of civilians, this new paragraph, would still be desirable for two reasons viz:-(a) all parties to the Red Cross Convention may not becomeparties to the Civilian Convention;(b) the protection proposed for civilian institutions is,at present, limited to &quot;hospiuaxs&quot; whereas protectionis given to all military medical formations and establishments including, for example, field ambulances,aid posts, etc.
M,riy Committee reoommend approval of this reoomraendation. (C.R.G.C.A(48 L&apos;.tem 311 - &apos;   ^rv&apos;i*,tItem 31)3^2.   B.Q.,.

Subject to oertainconditions specified in Artiole 9, the 1929 Red Cross Convention providefor stretcher bearers and auxiliary nurses, &quot;if they are takenprisoners while carrying out these functions? to be treated exactly the same as medioal personnel.   The 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts omitted any references to these olassee fromtheir recommendations;   but I think this arose because the Committeeconcerned largely concentrated their attention on the positionafter capture.364.   Clearly to withdraw the obligation to respect and protectthese classes, when carrying out their functions, would be to weaken the protection of the wounded and sick on the battle-field whioh isthe &quot;raison d&apos;etre&quot; of the Red Cross Convention.   I do&apos;not think &apos;the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts intended to doso.   My Committee did not examine this particular question in detail.365.   After consultation with the representative of the DireotorGeneral of the Army. Medioal Servioes and with the General Staff,I recommend, and I am confident that my Committee would agree withthe reoommen ation (that is why I have not delayed to summonanother meeting;, that the United Kingdom delation to &quot;a future international Conference should propose that stretcher bearers and auxiliary nurses, carrying identity documents showing that-theyhave been trained for that purpose:-(a)   should &quot;be respected&quot;and protected under all circumstances&quot; when carrying out their functions as such;(bj   should wear a distinctive armband (not bearing theRed Cross emblem) when officially carrying out their functions;(c)   should be available to be used- after oapture, if required, to assist medical personnel in the care of the wounded and sick, and, whilst so used,should be given the same freedoms and facilities asmedical personnel (see oaragraph 162(b) above).- (C.R.&amp;.C./.-t48)4, Item 27)366.   K.C. Article 11 lays down the conditions on which the &quot;medicalpersonnel and formations&quot; of a neutral aid society may assist abelligerent.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended a number of additions to the Article which raise noquestions calling oomment;   and also that the personnel of suchneutral aid societies, if captured, should continue to be treated.in the way-laid down for all proteoted personnel in the 1929 red cross Convention (i.e. not be made prisoners of war,be sent, baoklat the first opportunity, etc.).   My Committee reoommend approvallof this recommendation.   . (C. R. G. C./M(47)5* Item fcl)367.   R.C. Articles 14 and 15.   The 1929 Red Cross Conventionprovides that mobile medioal formations which fall into the handsof the enemy, must be &quot;restored&quot; as soon as a route is open;whereas &quot;the buildings and material of fixed mediaal establishments&quot;are subject to the laws of war, though they may not be diverted from their purpose so long as they are needed to look after wounded and sick.368.   In modern war this differentiation of treatment is rarely, ifever, observed;   and mobile formations, like fixed establishments,have been appropriated by their captors.   The 1947 ^^gjES.of Government Experts accordingly recommended that ^J^^^lshould be amalgamated into one. in the following comprehensive terms.
&quot;The buildings, material and stores of fixed uedical i AOestablishments and of mobile medical units of the armed      .       -i (l Oforces shall remain-subject to the lav/s of war, but maynot be diverted from their purpose, so long us they arerequired for the care of wounded aud siokCUrr committee, &quot;reoommend approval of, this recommendation.

R.C. article 17.   The 1929 Red Gross Convention provides in thisArticle for the treatment of medical transport and its personnel.In conformity with the general principles adopted by them, the 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended that the.

Ay Committee recommend that theUnited Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should support these recommendations.    (C.R.G.C./M(48)4, Item 31)371.   R.C. Article 18.

Article 29 requires the High Contracting Parties to takenecessary measures to repress in wartime, acts contrary to the Convention,iio questions arise on this Article.377.   R.c. Article 30.   The 1929 Red Cross Convention provides for an enquiry into any alleged breach to be held &quot;on the request of a belligerent&quot;;   butit provided no effective machinery for ensuring such enquiry being held.i&apos;he Article goes on to require belligerents to repress any proved violation.The Article had no practical-effect during the Second World War;   and this,no doubt, gave rise to the proposals at the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts for making it effective.   These proposals ultimatelycrystallised in:-(a) the recommendation of an Article on War Grimes - see paragraphs 2u8 to 218 above;(b) the recommendation for an &quot;autoraatio&quot; enquiry Article - see.   paragraph 37b&apos; below.378. ,,ith reference to paragraph 377(b) above, the 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts recommended, the United Kingdom ^lef**^eserv^its attitude, that the &quot;enquiry&quot; Article should.be xn the following uerras.-
&quot;Any High Contracting Party alleging a violation of thepresent Convention may demand the opening of an offioialenquiry.This enquiry shall be carried out as soon as possible by a Commission instituted for each particular case,&apos; comprising three neutral members seleoted from a list .of qualified persons drawn up by the High ContractingParties in time of peace, eaoh Party nominating foursuoh persons.The plaintiff and defendant States shall eaoh nominateone member of the Commission.   The third member shallbe designated by the other two and, in case they are notable to agree, by the President of the international court of Justice.As soon as the enquiry is closed, the Commission shallreport to the Parties concerned on the reality and natureof the alleged facts, and may make appropriate recommendations.All facilities shall be extended by the High ContraotingParties to the Commission of Inquiry, in the fulfilment of its duties.&quot;379.   The United Kingdom delegation at the 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts pointed out that the elaborate prooedure setout in the proposed new Article referred to in paragraph 378 above:-(a) would not make a belligerent, who did not wish to doso, nominate a member of the enquiry;(b) ignored the almost certain, security objection to a neutral, nominated by an enemy, being allowed to investigate into matters, which must inevitablyinclude some intelligence of value to that enemy.330.   The Foreign Offioe have sinoe observed:-&quot;There are accordingly grave objections to all the suggestions put forward at Geneva except on the lines ofthe original Artiole 30 of the 1929 Bed Cross Convention.This would allow of some action even in time of war, e.g.allegations that prisoners or civilian camps were unnecessarilyexposed to danger oould be investigated and remedied.   Butthe new Artiole 32 (see paragraph 378 above).whioh is an .attempt to make the old Article 30 more precise, is impracticable in time of war, as our delegation pointedout at Geneva.   If it had any result it would be to setup numerous committees investigating comparatively minor breaches, whereas major breaches suoh, for instanoe,as the shooting of Canadian prisoners in Normandy shortly after the landing, would be ruled out as being impossiblewith a battle in progress, or on security grounds.&quot;361.   The recommendation set out in paragraph 376 above has not beendiscussed by my Committee;   but the mind of the Committee is, Ithink, clear from its recommendations regarding the 1947 Conferencerecommendations on War Crimes (see paragraphs 208 to 218 above;.I am asking the Deputy Director of Military Operations (a), WarOffice, to ask for the views of the Chiefs of Staff on the proposal;and if, as I anticipate, they advise against accepting        suchobligation, I recommend that, having regard also to the ForeignOffice view quoted in paragraph 380 above, the united kingdom delegation to a future International Conference(a)   should resist this proposal as impracticable;i,b)   should aocept only a form of wording-which would leave the nature and method of working of an
enquiry to be settled between the belligerents,perhaps with the assistance of the ProtectingPowers, at the time.382. R.0, Articles 31 to 39 are the formal Articles about ratification,entering into force of the Convention, etc. Wo questions arise on these articles.PART IV - OTHER QUESTIONS383.   P.W. Article 3 requires prisoners of war to be treated with respect for their persons and honour and that women shall be treated with allconsideration due to their sex.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of * government experts reoommended the addition of the words &quot;and in no oase should theirtreatment be less favourable than that accorded to male prisoners of war&quot;(see also paragraphs 92, 234, 296 , 298 and 354 above);   and my Committeereoommend approval of this recommendation. ! (C.R.G.C./m(48)8, Item 57)384.   P.W. Artiole 5 is closely linked with documentation (see especiallyparagraph 419 below).   The1947 Geneva Conference of Government Expertsreoommended amendments designed to seoure:-(a) that the prisoner of war gives information essential forhis identity to be established by his own Government;(b) proteotion against pressure to give additional information.my Committee reoommend approval of these recommendations. (C.R.G.C./M(48)6,Item 47)385.   P.W. Article 7 deals with the transfer of prisoners of war from one place to another:   the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended this Artiole be strengthened by requiring that:-(a) evacuation should be carried out in humane conditions;(b) that the conditions of movement should be the same asthose for troops of the Detaining Power on the move;(o)   sufficient food, water, clothing and shelter should be- provided for eaoh prisoner of war.fey Committee recommend approval of these recommendations. (C.R.G. C./M(48)3 ,fit em. 20)o    (See also paragraphs 72 to 83 and 266 to 269 above).386.   P.W. Article 13.   Hygiene of Camps.   The 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts reoommended that the Detaining Power should be requiredto provide soap (as well as water) and for laundering as well as bodily(cleanliness.   My Committee reoommend approval of these recommendations.J(C.R.&amp;.C./M(47)4, Item 32) &quot;* -387.   P.W. Artiole 14.   Medical and Hospital Treatment.   This Article inthe 1929 Prisoners of War Convention provides for:-camp infirmaries and isolation establishments;   and for admission to a suitable military or civil institution in serious cases;the expense of treatment to be borne by the detaining power:    including &quot;temporal remedial apparatus&quot;;the issue to a prisoner o^ war, on demand, of an official statement of nature and duration of an illness, and ofthe. treatment;agreements to retain doctors and medical orderlies inprisoners of war camps (see also Artiole 12, Red CrossConvent ion).388.   The 1^47 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommendedprovisions additional to those referred to in paragraph 387, as follows:-Ul(a;(b)(c)(A)
(a) prisoners of war not to be prevented from presentingthemselves for medioal examination;(b) all necessary apparatus a artificial appliances,dentures and speotaoies to be provided at the expenseof the Detaining Power (instead of only &quot;temporaryremedial apparatus&quot; - see paragraph 387(b) above);(o)   the statement referred to in paragraph 387(c) above to be certified;   and a duplioate to be sent to theCentral Prisoners of War Agency (see paragraphbelow);(d) removal of provision referred to in paragraph 387(d)to the Red Cross Convention;(e) wherever possible prisoners of war to be treated bymedioal personnel from their own country;(f) speoial facilities to be provided for the care andtraining of the blind.Illy Committee reoommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should support these recommendations.(C.R.G.C./fc(47)4, Item 32)389.   P.W: Article 16.   Religious Observance.   The 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts recommended that any prisoner of war who satisfied the Detaining Power that he was a minister of religion(even though he was not captured as a chaplain) should be relieved of the obligation to work so that he oould minister to his fellowprisoners of war of the same faith.   Some European countries do notexempt ministers: of religion from conscription for military servioe.jMy Committee recommend approval of this recommendation., (C.R.G.C./k(47)5,I Item 36)390.   Government of India proposal.   The delegate of the Governmentof India proposed the introduction into prisoners of war camps ofministers of religion, where there were prisoners of a faith, noministers of which were held by the Detaining Power.   He clearlyhad in mind provision for his compatriots, who might be captured in a oountry where there were no ministers of the religions ofIndia.   The Conference, whilst sympathetic to the purpose of theamendment, realised the grave objections from the security and intelligence angles.   The delegate of the Government of India was asked privately by the United Kingdom delegation at the 1947Conference, to arrange for a full statement of their case.to be forwarded to us through the India Offioe.391.   Since the Conference, India and Pakistan have come into existence as new members of the British Commonwealth.   The Governmentof Pakistan have said that they do not regard the proposal of theprevious Government of India as neoessary, provided that religiousbooks aan be admitted freely to prisoners, as Artiole 39 would allow,(see paragraph 291 above).   No information has been reoeived regardingIthe attitude of the new Government of India.   My Committee do not recommend approval of the proposed addition.392.   P.W. Artiole 17.   Intellectual and Sporting pursuits.   no special points arose on this Article at the 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts exoept that- the Prenoh delegation were anxious to include in it a prohibition against &quot;propaganda&quot;.   Allother delegations to the Conference disagreed in view of thedifficulty of knowing what was &quot;propaganda&quot;.   There is a tendency in some oountries to seek to impose on Detaining Powers obligations to provide intelleotual and educational activities;&apos;   but the UnitedKingdom delegation at Geneva resisted this tendency as it might give positive sanction to activities, on the part of the Detaininglower, directed to suborning the allegiance of (tbaM from^theirrwn Government.   My Committee recommend approval of the text of thisI Icicle blended by the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts,I viz:-
&quot;-Belligerents shall encourage the intellectual,educational, recreative and outdoor pursuits organised by prisoners of war and shall take the necessary stepsto ensure their exercise.   The individual liberty ofprisoners, of war shall be respected in all circumstances.Prisoners of War shall have facilities for engaging in physical exeroises and obtaining the benefit of beingout of doors.&quot;     (J.H.G.C./M(47)5* Item 37)^93.   P.W. -article 20 (see also P.W. Article 84) requires regulations,orders, announcements, etc., to be given in a language understood bythe orisoners of war;   the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended provisions that all orders and other communications shouldbe posted up in the camp in the language of the prisoners, where theycan see them and that a copy of all such should be sent to the CampLeader.    (See also paragraphs 150 to 151 above and 397 below).   my committee recommend approval of these recommendations.&apos;(C.R.G.C./vL(48)3, Item 23(a))394.   P.W. Artiole 21 provides for the exchange of titles and ranksbetween belligerents and also for the treatment of offioers with due regard to their rank and age.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts recommended that the communication of titles and ranks should cover all who, under Article 1, may be made prisoners of war;   and that new titles or ranks, created after the outbreak of war, should also becommunicated.   The 1947 Conference also suggested that the internation red Cross Committee might collect from the Parties to the Convention, inpeace, the available information, and on the outbreak of a war, immediatelycommunicate it to all belligerents.   My Committee accept these recommendations.395. P.W. Artiole 22 deals with the provision of orderlies for offioersfrom prisoners of war of the same foroes, and also with the arrangementsfor officers&apos; food, olothing and messing. The 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts reoommended :*-(a) that officers&apos; orderlies should be specifically relieved of any other kind of work;(b) /chat the Artiole should conform to the recommendation inArticle 4 (see paragraph 233 above), under whioh the detaining Power would be required to provide food and clothing for offioers (as for other ranks) &quot;free of charge&quot;;(o)   that the Article should be extended to cover other ranks;and that all ranks should be allowed to assist in themanagement of their own messes.t&apos;Iy Committee recommend approval of these recommendations.(C.R.G.C./M(47)4, Items 30 and 31)396.   P.W. article 33 deals with provisions regarding labour detachments.?he 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts reoonanended that the commandant of a Base Camp should be required to maintain a complete and up to date list of all labour detaohments based on his camp;   andcommunicate this list to official visitors to the oamp from the protecting power, eto.   My Committee accept these recommendations.(0.R.G.C./M(48)3. Item 23(lv))397.   P.W. Artiole 35 deals with the publication of measures for executionof the Convention.   My Committee aooept the clarification of this Artiolerecommended by the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts.   (See alsoparagraphs 150, 151 and 393 above&quot;).396.   p.w. Artiole 41.   Transmission of Legal Doouments and Wills.   Onlyeditorial amendments arise.    (See also paragraph 408 below).399.   P.W. Article 42.   Rights to make oomplaints.   The 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts recommended some strengthening of this
Artiole, including an addition authorising Camp Leaders to send to the protecting power short periodical reports on conditions in their oampsi and the needs of the prisoners of war.   My Committee recommend approvalI of the recommendations.    (C.R.G.C./M(48)3, Item 23(a))400.   P.W. Article 43.   Appointment and duties of Camp Leaders (calledprisoners&apos; representatives).   The 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts recommended re-wording this Artiole:   the only change whichoall3 for comment is a requirement that the reasons for the refusal ofthe Detaining Power authorities to approve a Camp Leader elected byprisoners of war should be indioated to the Protecting Power.   TheDirector.of Prisoners of War was not entirely happy about this, but,after further consultation with the&quot; Foreign Offioe, his representativeis satisfied that the reasons oould always be couched in terms whioh1 would not embarrass the War Office.   My Committee reoommend approvalJ of th&amp; recommendations.    (C.R.G.C./M(48)3, Item 23(b))401.   P.W. Article 44.   Further provisions regarding Camp Leaders.   The1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended/i^sngTbcningthis Article, in particular, by:-(a) a specific requirement that Gamp Leaders should not berequired to do work that will interfere with their CampLeader duties;(b) mentioning specifically facilities for correspondence withthe Detaining Power, the Protecting Power, the internation red Cross Committee, and Mixed Medical Commissions;(c) providing for Gamp Leaders of labour detachments thesame facilities as for those in Base Camps;(d) a provision that a Camp Leader, being transferred fromone camp to another, should be given time to hand overto his successor.fi.y Committee recommend approval of these recommendations.(C.R.G.C./M(48)3, Item 23(a) and (e))402.   P.W. Article 69 deals with the appointment of Mixed MedioalCommissions to decide whether prisoners of war are eligible for repatriation on disability grounds.   The, 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts reoommended:-(a) setting out, in detail in an annexe, rules for theappointment and procedure of Mixed Medical ^Commissions;(b) that prisoners of war accepted by the medioal authorities of the Detaining Power as qualified for repatriation,need not go before a Mixed Medical Commission.The proposed rules under (a) above do act raise any special questions;and the recommendation at (b) is time-saving and common sense.   my committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should-support these recommendations, subjectto some amendment of the proposed rules on points of detail.(C.R.G.C./M(48)2, Item 14)403.   p. tf. Artiole 70 deals with those who may appear before MixedMedical Commissions, with a view to repatriation or accommodation in a neutral oountry.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of government experts reoommended that this Article be expanded;   and a provision *added that prisoners of war may present themselves for examination;but that any individual who puts himself forward will be examinedonly after those who have been recommended  or an examination by medical officers of their own foroes, an Ally Or the Detaining Power,by the Camp Leader, by &quot;their own Government or by a duly recognisedVoluntary Aid Society.   This recommendation is based oh experience in the Seoond World War, when individuals Who presented themselves for examination by a Mixed Medioal Commission took their plaoe in thequeue, wi*h the result that many genuine oases were not able to be
examined on a particular visit of a Mixed Medioal Comuiission owing to 1 A&apos;the number of individuals claiming examination on &quot;frivolous&quot; grounds^i Ily Committee recommend approval of these recommendations.I.(C.H.&amp;.0./m(4S)2, Item 14(a))..404.   gala Article 71 provides for the repatriation of those injured atwork.   No questions arise on this Article.405.   P.v/* Article 72 provides for agreements for the repatriation, ortransfer to neutral countries, of prisoners of war,- in good health, whohave been a long time in captivity.   Bae 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts recommended the deletion from the beginning of thisArticle of the words &quot;for humanitarian reasons&quot;, because they gave riseduring the Second World War, to many misunderstandings amongst certainclasses of prisoners of war who claimed repatriation for special (personal)-reasons which they regarded as &quot;humanitarian&quot;.   My Committee recommendjapproval of this recommendation.    (C.R.G.C./m(48)2, Item 13(a)(iii))406.   P.W. Article 73 deals with payment of the expenses of repatriation.No question arises on this Article.407.   P.W. Artioles&apos;76 and 77.   As stated in paragraph 340 above, my committee came to the conclusion that the provisions of these Articles ofthe 1929 Prisoners of War Convention and the corresponding Artioles 3 and4 of the 1929 Red Cross Convention needed co-ordination and substantialre-arrangement;   and the identity card provisions in Artiole 5 of the prisoners of War Convention and of Article 21 in the Red Cross convention are also relevant.   My Committee&apos;s recommendations regarding this re-arrangement are set out in paragraphs 408 to 426 below, in whioh are also considered, as they arise, any relevant reoommendations either from the1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts or from my Committee for modifying the existing provisions.   Revised texts showing how thesereoommendations may be embodied in Articles for each Convention will be circulated in C.R.G. C./P(48)56.   Artiole 6 of the proposed MaritimeConvention - see Appendix B - should be based on the text ultimatelyadopted for the Red Cross Convention.408.   Jills, (see also paragraph 398 above).   &amp;y Committee recommend thatthe United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should propose provisions about Wills on the following lines:-(a) an Article in the Prisoners of War Convention providingfor prisoners of war to make Wills &quot;under the same conditions as soldiers of the Forces with whom the prisoners of war were serving at the time of oapture&quot;:Article 76 of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention providesfor them to be made &quot;under the same conditions as forsoldiers of the national armed forces&quot;;    (C.R.G.C./M(48)8,Item 56(a))(b) Articles in.both the Prisoners of War and Red CrossConventions requiring Wills (or any document likely toserve the purpose of a Will) of the dead to be forwardedthrough the Prisoners of War Information Bureau to thePower with whose forces the dead person was serving whencaptured.

My Committee recommend that in the prisoners of Vfer Convention there should be an Article requiring:* -(a) the Detaining Power to notify, as speedily as possible, the names of the dead, through its Prisoners of War InformationBureau to the Power in whose services the deceased prisoner of war was at the time of capture;(b) that the burial or cremation of the dead be preceeded bya careful and if possible, medical examination of the bodieswith a view to confirming death and establishing identityand enabling a report on the cause of death to be made;
(o)   the Detaining Power to forward through its Prisoner of WarInformation Bureau to the Power in whose service the deceased prisoner of war was at the time of capture,individual certificates of death or a certified listof dead, showing, so far as known, the date and causeof death in each case;   and in any case Of doubt aboutthe identity of the deceased prisoner of war, all available particulars, and in particular any, Indicationwhich might assist the adverse belligerent in identifyingthe deceased prisoner of war should also be forwardedthrough the Prisoner of War Information Bureau.   (Peridentity disos see paragraphs 420 and 421 below:   for. personal effects see paragraph 42$ below).(C.B.G.C./fa(48)8, Item 53(a))411.   My Committee reoommend that in the Bed Cross Convention thereshould be an Artiole following the same lines as. recommended isparagraph 410 above with the necessary changes in wording to applyto dead aolleoted, discovered or buried by a belligerent;   andintroduced by provisions discussed in paragraphs 412 and 413 below.412.   Artiole 3 (see paragraph 356 above) of the 2$29 Red GrossConvention requires that&quot;After each engagement the occupant of the field of battle shall take measures to search for the wounded and dead......&quot;The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Szperts recommended that,in view of the nature of modern land war, the words &quot;after eachengagement&quot; should be replaced by &quot;at all times and particularlyafter anl* engagement&quot;, and that the whole passage should read:-&quot;At all times and particularly after an engagement, eachbelligerent shall, without delay, take the necessary measures to search for the wounded and dead....&quot;413*. My Committee consider that an obligation to &quot;take thenecessary measures to search&quot; &quot;at all times&quot; would be difficultof fulfilment;   they therefore recommend that the word &quot;necessary&quot;should be replaced by &quot;reasonable&quot;.   They further reoommend that,provided that this amendment be accepted, if the words &quot;at all times&quot; are pressed, the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should accept them;   but that if theword ^necessary&quot; is maintained, the delegation should resist theinclusion of the words &quot;after each engagement^.   They recommendthat the United Kingdom delegation to a future international conference should propose the following wording:-&quot;Belligerents shall take all reasonable measures to search for the dead and wounded and to protect themagainst pillage and maltreatment.&quot;(C.R.G.C./M(48)8, Item 53(a) and (c))414.

The 1547 Geneva Conference of Government -experts recommended:- -(a) that prisoners of war who die in captivity should behonourably buried, if possible according to the rightsof their religion;(b) deceased prisoners of war should be interred in &apos;individual graves except in pases of necessitywhere the use of collective graves might be essential(e.g. a number of deaths arising from one explosion);(c) that bodies should not be oremated exoept forimperative reasons of hygiene or for religious motivesand that in cases of cremation &quot;the oircumstanoesand motives&quot; should be stated in detail in the death certificate of the cremated person and that similar provisions should apply to dead bodies
reoovered by a belligerent from the field of battle.My Committee reoommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should support these recommendations of the1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts.    (C.R.G.C./M(48)8, Item 53)415.   Graves.   Artiole 76 of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention providesthat the belligerent shall ensure that graves of deceased prisoners ofwar *&quot;bear the necessary indications and are treated with respect and suitably maintained&quot;and Article 4 of the 1929 Red Cross Convention provides that belligerentsshall ensure that the graves of dead found on the battle-field:-(a) are respected and markea, so that they may always be found;(b) -registered by an official Graves Registration Service torender eventual exhumation possible and to ensure the identification of bodies whatever may be the subsequentsite of the graves;and provides that belligerents(o)   shall exchange a list of graves and of dead interred intheir oemsteries and elsewhere after the cessation ofhostilities.416.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended anumber of improvements&apos;in these provisions, and also that the provisionsregarding Graves Registration Service and the care of graves, etc. shouldbe applied so far as possible to the ashes of those cremated, whichshould be kept by the Graves Registration Service until, the. close ofhostilities.   The Director General,Graves Registration and Enquiries,War Office has informed the Committee that he has no facilities for theoustody of ashes:   nevertheless jsy Committee do not recommend that theUnited Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference propose any modification in the recommendation of the 1947 Conference on this account.   They assume that, in any case, the Director General GravesRegistration and Enquiries would be responsible for keeping a record ofashes and their whereabouts,, and that arrangements for their custodywould be made by the Adjutant-General&apos;s department;   and that suoharrangements would satisfy the requirements recommended by the 1947Conference.: X mention this here so that it may not be overlooked.417*   My Committee recommend approval1of the recommendations of the1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts on the subject of gravesand the custody of ashes;   and that the provisions of the Prisoners ofWar and Red Cross Conventions on these subjects should be identical andshould be dealt with in a separate Artiole in each Convention.(C.R.G.C./fa(48)8, Item 53)418.   My Committee further reoommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should propose that the Prisoners ofWar and Red Cross Conventions should each include provisions that:-(a) a belligerent should be responsible for graves and the records relating&apos; to them only so long as that belligerentremains in control of the territory in whioh the grave is;(b) if, for any reason, the belligerent ceases to control theterritory in whioh the grave is, the Power into whosecontrol such territory oomes, if a party to the Conventions,should carry the obligations of the Conventions regardinggraves in that territory from the date that Power oomesinto oontrol of that territory.    (C.R.G.C./iv.(48)8, &amp;Item 53(j)(III))419.   identity Cards.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government experts recommended that all persons liable to become prisoners of war if captured,should carry a standard identity card.   The representatives of the
Ministry of Transport said that, until the Ministry could compare thestandard card, if adopted, with the card now carried by personnel ofthe Merchant Havy, he desired to reserve the position on. Merohantseamen.   Subject to this reservation my Committee recommend that theUnited Kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should support this recommendation provided that the details suggested atthe 1947 Geneva Conference of- Government Experts be reduced to theminimum essential for identification purposes.    (For finger-printssee paragraphs 204 to 207 above). . (See also paragraph 439 belowl(C.R.G. 0^(48)6, Items 45 and 46)420.   identity Discs.   Artiole 77 of the 1929 Prisoners of war convention requires the Prisoners of War Information Bureau tocolleot and transmit to the countries concerned the &quot;identitytokens&quot; of prisoners of war who have died;   and Article 4 of&quot; the1929 Red Cross Convention requires- belligerents, in the case ofthe dead,&quot;to collect and transmit to eaoh other....... one half- of their identity discs, the other half to remainattached to the body.?:This latter provision assumes a double identity diso, the halves ofwhich have identical particulars, and can be separated without unduedifficulty.421.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended the insertion after the word &quot;disos&quot; in Artiole 4 of the 1929 red cross Convention (see paragraph 420 above) of the words&quot;which should be of a standard pattern&quot;.After discussing this recommendation at some length,   My committee recommend that the United Kingdom delegation to a future Inter- &quot;national Conference:-(a)   should resist any obligation to use a double identitydisc;but   (b)   should be authorised, if other delegations pressstrongly for the use of suoh by all parties to theConvention, to agree in the last resort.(C.R.G.C./M(48)12, Item 94)422.   Prisoners of War Information Bureaux.   The 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts reoommended a number of minorchanges.in Article 77 of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention themost important of which was perhaps, the recommendation that&quot;information concerning the state of health of wounded orsick prisoners of war shall be furnished regularly, ifpossible every week&quot;.-The 1947 Conference also recommended that the information aboutwounded and sick and dead collected or discovered on the battle-field, which Article 4 of the 1929 Red Cross Convention requiresbelligerents to communicate &quot;to eaoh other reoipr&quot;ocally&quot;, should be transmitted through the Prisoners of War Information Bureaux.   Thisis an interesting provision linking the two Conventions and assuming that all the parties to the Red Cross Convention will be parties tothe Prisoners of War Convention.423.   My Committee recommend approval of the recommendations of the1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts regarding Prisoners ofWar Information Bureaux referred to in paragraph 422 above;   but theydo not regard these recommendations as sufficient.424.   My Committee therefore recommend that the United kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should propose thatthe existing provisions should be expanded into three separateArticles in the Prisoners of War Convention on the following lines:-
(a) an artiole placing on the Detaining Power an obligation to * &quot;collect all relevant information about the identity of a prisoner of -war and to maintain a reoord whioh should include information about his state of health, his -whereaboutsand movements, of any judicial sentences passed upon him, andany other information which belligerents may mutually agree;(b) an article providing for the setting up of Prisoners of WarInformation Bureau with the necessary staff, accommodation and equipment to ensure its efficient working;   and allowing; the employment of prisoners of war in such a bureau;(o)   an artiole setting out in full the duties of the Prisoners of-War Information Bureau.(0. E. G. 0.(48) 6, Item 47)425.   My Committee further recommend that the United Kingdom delegation toa future International Conference ohoi^d,. also propose -;that - the convention should provide that the recording and transmission of information as laiddown in the first and third of the Articles referred to in paragraph 424above, should be reciprocal, and that failure of a belligerent to reoord   &quot;&quot;and transmit such information should relieve the adverse belligerent of theobligation to- record anything but a minimum of essential; information regarding identity and casualties, to be laid down in the Convention.(C.R.G.C./M(48)6, Item 47(f))426.   Personal Effects.   With regard to personal effects, W Committeereoommend that, within certain limits, articles of a personal nature shouldbe sent home, in the event of the death of the prisoner of war;   that inother oases, prisoners of war should normally take their personal effectswith them on repatriation, but that, if for any reason, suoh effects are left behind, they should be sent on by the Detaining Power, up to a maximumweight of 25 kilograms;   and that only artioles of a personal nature shouldbe sent back in the case of dead found on the battle-field.   There are anumber of other detailed-provisions which do not oall for special commenthere;   but which are embodied in draft Articles which aSe.j3et out inG.E.G.C./P(48)56.427.   P.W. Artiole 78.   Belief Societies.   The 1929 Prisoners of war convention provides for facilities to be given to properly constitutedsocieties for the relief of prisoners of war.   The United States delegationproposed an entirely new wording which would make any visits by reliefagenoies subject to strict control and would limit them to,visits to deliver&quot;relief supplies and reoreational, educational and devotional material&quot;;   andspecifically provides for national as well as international organisations,whilst recognising the exceptional position of the International Red cross committee.   The 1947 Geneva Conference Jof Government Experts recommended the revised text proposed by the United States delegation.428.   The World&apos;s Alliance&apos; of Young Men&apos;s Christian Associations have sinoerepresented that this was a Very serious limitation on the rights given bythe 1929 Convention, and that the United States hc-d agreed to modify the wording proposed at the 1947 Conference^ to permit representatives of reliefsocieties to be granted &quot;the privilege of visiting prisoner of war camps&quot;,not only for the purpose of distributing relief supplies, but also forministering to the needs of prisoners of war in the spiritual, eduoationaland reoreational fields.   Visits would be entirely at the discretion of the detaining Power:   but the wording would give representatives of responsiblerelief organisations, ground from whioh to press a claim, to be allowed to visit prisoners of war, on a reluctant Detaining Power.   The World&apos;s alliance and the International Students World Federation were the only bodies thatdid any &quot;relief&quot; work generally during the Second World War, and the latterdid not, I think, ask for facilities to visit oamps.   The visits of therepresentatives of the World&apos;s Alliance to oamps in Germany were ofundoubted value to our men in German hands, and my Committee consider thatit would be unfortunate if such visits were not possible in any futureI conflict.429.   My Committee- recommend approval of the recommendations of the 1947Geneva Conference of Government Experts subject to the modification referredto in paragraph 428 above, regarding &quot;the privilege of visiting&quot; oamps for representatives of recognised relief societies.

i3P&apos; Artiole 79.   The Central Agency of Information.   This Article ^ -Jor a central Agency of Information regarding prisoners 0f war (which the     U*Meraatioml Red Cross Committee has established in two world Wars).The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended that aPf?VvS^ should be ^aed that the Central Agency shall receive fromall belligerents facilities for forwarding news about prisoners of war.431.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts also recommended:-(a)   that the International Bed Cross Committee should be allotted a special wavelength for broadcasting;   thereare serious teabnioal&quot;&apos;objeotions to doing so in peaoe,but it might prove practicable in war when manywavelengths normally in use are no longer wanted fortheir normal purpose:   in any oase several wavelengthswould be necessary if a 24 hours service to all partsof the world were to be available;(b). that Governments should study the question of the financing of the Central Prisoners of War Agency. &quot;*432.  My Committee reoommend that, in view of the technical difficultiesthe United Kingdom delegation to a future International conference should resist any proposal to provide in the Prisoners of War convention for the allocation of a special wavelength to the. Central Prisoners ofWar Agency.   The difficulties have already been explained informally to the representatives of the International Red Cross Committee.(C.R.G.C./yr(47)3, Item 20)433*   My Committee accept the recommendation referred to in paragraph 430above.   No immediate action seems called for on the recommendationreferred to in paragraph 431(b) above.434.   P.W. Article 80 provides for postal and telegraphic franchisesfor Information Bureaux.   These questions are really outside thescope of the Prisoners Of War Convention.    (See paragraphs 435 and436 below).435.   Postal Franchise.   This was already given to Information Bureaux;and it has been extended to the Central Agency by agreement at the1947 Paris Postal Congress, and the amendment to the Universal Postal.Convention takes effect from 1st July, 1948.436.   Telegraphic Franchise.   This Article was the subject of discussion in London last Autumn between representatives of the International red cross Committee and the General Post Office and the War Office.   TheInternational Red Cross Committee pressed at the 1947 Geneva Conferenceof Government Experts for telegraphic franchise (as well as postalfranchise - see paragraph 435 above.   They also wanted a broadcastingwavelength or wavelengths reserved for.the Central Agency in war-time(see paragraphs 431 and 432 above).   Informal discussions in Londonlast Autumn with International Red Cross Committee representativesconvinced them of the practical difficulties inherent in both proposals;and it was left for &quot;the International&apos;Red Gross Committee to raise thequestion of telegraphic franchise with the secretariat of theInternational Telecommunication Organisation at Geneva, and then to approach the Swiss Government, if they wanted further action taken.437.   The essential difficulty is that, whereas additional postaltraffic for Information Bureaux will often involve no appreciableadditional postal services expenditure, additional telegraphic traffic would increase expenditure almost in direct proportion to the increasedtraffio, and also involve delay in the normal commercial traf11c.   asa large part of this traffic is likely to be in and out of Switzerland,if the Central Agency were&apos;again established there, the proposedfranchise might be mainly at the expense of the Swiss Government;   andforthat reason the International Red Cross Committee representativesSreadviSd to raise the matter, after discussion with the-secretariat of the International Telecommunications Organisation, with the bwissGovernment.438.   R.C. Artiole 21 provides for the identity documents&quot;of, and
the use of the Red Cross by, personnel &quot;protected&quot; by the Geneva 4 j qConventions, i.e. medioal personnel, ohaplains and other personnel 4.4^exclusively engaged in the collection, transport and treatment ofthe wounded and sick, to whom would be added under the recommendationsof the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts, those engaged &quot;inthe prevention.of disease&quot; (see paragraph 159 above). (See also paragraph448 below).439.   Identity Cards. If the proposals-for identity cards of a standardpattern to be carried by all persons liable to be made prisoners of warbe adopted (see paragraph 419 above) the same standard card should beused for medical personnel, with the addition, presumably, of a Red Crosson the front or in the heading and, perhaps, an entry showing qualificationsor &quot;trade&quot; (e.g. doctor, 000k, masseur, etc.) for the information of the detaining Power in using them for the care of the wounded and sick. t440.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts reoommended thatall personnel &quot;protected&quot; by the Convention (i.e. ohaplains and all thosewho were required to look after the wounded and,sick) should wear armletsbearing the Red Cross emblem.. -Hitherto the Red Cross emblem has been limited to the brassards of those ^engaged exclusively in&apos;the ooileotion,transport and treatment of the wounded and sick, and in the administrationof medical formations and establishments, and chaplains&quot;;   and regimentalstretcher bearers have worn a brassard but with the letters &quot;S.B.&quot; insteadof the Red Cross.   This category of stretcher bearer would disappear fromthe protection of the Convention under the recommendations of the 1947Conference (see paragraphs 363 to 365 above), but&quot;if my recommendation for&quot;protection&quot; to be. continued to stretaher bearers, when actually performingtheir functions, is approved, the United Kingdom delegation to a future international Conference should propose a suitable brassard for suchpersonnel, to enable them to be quickly recognised on the field of battle.441.   R. 0. Artiole 22 provides for the flying of a flag bearing the RedGross emblem, with or without the national flag, by medioal formations&apos;and establishments (see also paragraphs 169 to 184 above)0   The 1947Geneva-Conference of Government Experts recommended an addition, to makethe flying of the national flag by belligerent fixed establishmentspermissive as it always has been for mobile formations. , This was inaccordance with the general attitude of the Conference in seeking to simplify the provisions of the Convention, wherever possible, and to removedistinctions between mobile formations and fixed establishments; which have largely ceased to have any meaning in modern war.   My Committee accept this recommendation.442.   R.C. Article 26 deals with the responsibility for carrying out theConvention.   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts recommended: -(a) that the Artiole should make it the duty of belligerents,acting through (3bmmanders-in-Chiefj to oarry out theConvention, instead of, as in the 1929 Red Cross Convention,imposing the duty directly on Commandersr-in-Chiefj(b) that a prohibition of reprisals would be added.i4y Committee accept these recommendations.  (See also Appendix B, paragraph 48)443.   R.C. Article 28 requires belligerents to take necessary legal measuresto protect the use of the Red Cross Emblem.   (See Geneva Convention Acts,1911 and 1937).   The 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts reoommendedonly such amendments as are consequential on the signing of a new Convention.% Committee reoommend approval of these recommendations, subject tothe.same reservation as was made by the United Kingdom on signing the 1929Red Cross Convention, viz:-&quot;in the sense that the legislative measures contemplated by that Artiole may provide that private individuals, associations-firms or companies who have used the Arms of the Swiss Confederation,or marks constituting an imitation thereof, for any lawful purposebefore the coming into force of the present Convention shall notbe prevented from continuing to use suoh Arms or marks for thesame purpose&quot;.(C.R.G.C./M(48)4, Item 28)
PART V - PROPOSED MARITIME COMVENTTQN (Appendix B. page a fl7 -to innVIN RELATION TO THE PRISONERS OF WAR AND RED CROSS Q0NV3^IOHa^444.   The questions proposed to be dealt with in the Maritime convention which impinge on questions dealt with in the Prisoners of War or red cross Conventions are as follows:-       &quot;(a) Article 3 whioh defines certain categories by reference toArtiole 1 of the Prisoners of War Convent ion;(b) Artiole 6 whioh deals with the notification by belligerentsto each other of wounded, sick and dead, the transmission of death certificates and personal effects, and burials,cremations and graves;(o)   Artiole 13 which concerns the use on other ships of theRed Cross and other distinctive markings authorised byArtiole 12 for hospital ships;(d) Artiole 16 whioh limits the application of the convention to land and marine forces &quot;on board&quot;, and specificallyapplies the Red Cross Convention to those &quot;ashore&quot; andwhich also protects.hospital ships against bombardmentfrom the Land;(e) Artiole 20 whioh deals with the use of medioal aircraft at sea;(f) Artiole 21 which deals with the use of the Red Cross emblemon flags, brassards and equipment belonging to the medioalservices;(g) Article 23 which provides for the armed forces to be instructed in the text of the Convention;(h) Artiole 25 whioh provides for particular agreementscovering matters beyond the obligations arising underthe Convention.No particular comments arise on (a) or (d) above.445.   M. Article 6 (Appendix B, paragraph 32).   My Committee reoommendthat the terms of this Artiole should follow those for the correspondingArtiole of the Red Cross Convention (see paragraphs 357 and 40? to 42$above) modified as necessary to meet the conditions of naval warfare.(See also Appendix B, paragraphs 6, 17 and 18).   My Committee contemplate that notification of the names of wounded, sick and dead picked up at sea, if landed at a port controlled by an adverse belligerent, would normally be notified through the Prisoners of War Information bureau of that belligerent;   and that in faot, suoh notifications would follow the prooedure laid down in the Prisoners of War Convention(see paragraphs 422 to 426 above).   Similarly if any bodies were landed they should be dealt with under precisely the provisions as forbodies ooileated by a belligerent on a field of battle.    (see paragraphs 410 to 418 above). (C.R.G.0./M(48) 13, Item 99)   .446.   M. Artiole 15 (Appendix B, paragraph 39).   1 call attention tothis Article here in view of the proposal to embody in the Prisonersof far Convention provision for Red Cross Transports marked similarlyto hospital ships (see paragraphs 126 to 136 above).   If the newmarking for hospital ships recomuiended in Appendix B, paragraph 38(M. Article 12) is adopted for hospital ships, the reasons would apply with equal force to other ships, to which it was desired togive immunity from attack.447.   M. Artiole 20 (Appendix B, paragraph 46) is concerned with theuse of medical aircraft at sea.   My Committee recommend that theconditions under which they should be given immunity from attackshould be the same as those they have recommended, subject to theapproval of the Chiefs of Staff, in paragraph 143(b) above to applyto medical aircraft flying over land... A2 -
1,1,8,   M. Artiole 21 (Appendix B, paragraph. 47).   The Artiole as 1 5 (Ireoommended by the Admiralty Sub-Committee is in general agreementwith the recommendations for the Red Cross Convention.   If standardidentity cards are provided for in the Prisoners of War Convention,the crews and staffs of hospital ships would presumably use them withthe same distinctive Red Cross marking as for ohaplains and medioalpersonnel of the land forces.    (See paragraphs 419 and 439 above).449.   M. Artiole 23 (Appendix B, paragraph 49) deals with instructingthe armed forces about the Convention (see paragraphs 149 to 151 above).m. Artiole 25 (Appendix B, paragraph 51) which provides for specialagreements should be considered in conjunction with paragraphs 55 to 61above.PART VI - CONCLUSION450.   In paragraph 29 above. I stated my view that the United kingdom delegation to a future International Conference should have clearinstructions on all the matters dealt with in Part II of this Report therecommendations of whioh are summarised in paragraph 221 above.. Wherethe United &quot;Kingdom view differs materially from the views of other powers, it is clearly desirable that the instructions to the delegation .should not deprive them of reasonable liberty in negotiating;   on theother hand, it will make the position of the delegation easier if, whateverinstructions they are given on these matters, set clearly the limit beyond which the United Kingdom delegation should not go towards meeting the viewsof other Powers.451.   Particularly, in my view, is it desirable that firm instructions,regarding the limit to whioh the delegation may go, should be given on thefollowing questions.War Crimes and Sanotions (paragraphs 208 to 218 above)Prisoners of War accused of War Grimes (paragraphs 99 to 101- above)(b)  -Repatriation on Termination of iiostilities (paragraphs 64to 87 above)(d)   Repatriability of &quot;Protected&quot; personnel (paragraphs 155 to&apos;     168 above)(el  Surrendered Enemy Personnel (paragraphs 44 to 50 above)(f)   Derogations from, and Intangibility of, the Conventions(paragraphs 51 to 61 above)Permissible work for Prisoners of War (paragraphs 62 to 71 above]Joint Responsibility of Transferee and Transferor Powers(paragraphs 72 to 80 above)( j)   The position of &quot;Partisans&quot; under the Conventions (paragraphs37 to 43 above) &quot;  .(k)   Application of the Conventions to Civil War and UndeclaredWar (paragraphs 30 to 36 above)(l)   Use of Pinger-prints on identity documents (paragraphs 204 to207 above)452.   Instructions to the delegation on (a), (f), (h) and (k) of paragraph451 above, and also on -Substitute for Protecting Power (paragraphs 144 to 148 above)Hospital Zones and Safety Localities (paragraphs 190 to 197above)will have to oover the attitude to be adopted, not only on the Prisonersof War, Red Cross and Maritime Conventions, but also on the civilian convention (see paragraph 219 above).   The same attitude need not necessarily be adopted on all these matters on the Civilian Convention as on the other three Conventions;   but clearly, if the United Kingdom delegation adoptsdifferent attitudes on any question, e.g. Civil War - see paragraph 220 abovethey are likely to be pressed strongly by other delegations to justify the differences.453.   It may be relevant also to recall, that the end of all these discussions will presumably be new Conventions which the United kingdom will be invited to sign.   The problem ever present in the minds of my committee has been, what would happen if, in the event, the final text on
any of these difficult issues goes beyond the limit which the UnitedKingdom Government would regard as acceptable..   Three choices will thenbe open, viz:-(a) to modify the united Kingdom attitude and accept thefinal texts;(b) to sign the Convention, with a reservation or reservationson the unacceptable points;(o)   to refuse to sign the Convention, because of one or moreunacceptable provisions in it.These ohoices are not before us, at the moment, and no decision on them is therefore called for;   but the knowledge that we may be broughtto choosing between them seems to me important and relevant to thedecisions now to be made.454*   A number of reoommendations of my Committee are subject to theapproval or comments of the Chiefs of Staff (see Appendix A).   As Ihave said (paragraph 4 above) the Deputy Director of Military Operations (a),War Office, has arranged for these questions to be submitted to theChiefs of Staff without further delay.455.   It will also be observed that, about certain recommendations of-  the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts, I have used the phrase &quot;ray Committee accept jhese recommendations&quot;.   These particularrecommendations were not brought speaifioally to the notice of theCommittee or discussed by them;    but they were available to all membersof the Committee in the first paper issued -to it (C.R.G. C./?(47)l);and I specifically asked them at the outset of our proceedings tobring before the Committee any matter, on which they were not satisfied,which I did not myself bring before them.   I think it is, therefore,legitimate to assume that recommendations, which in themselves seemreasonable and uncontroversial and about which no member of the Committeehas raised any question, should be recorded as having been &quot;accepted&quot;by them.*456.   With regard to Part III of the Report, the recommendations seemto me to be consistent with the policy hitherto adopted on thesematters, and there is therefore, to my mind, no call to seek specificapproval for any of these recommendations.   The purpose of Part iii of the Report is to place these recommendations on record, so thatthsy are available for easy reference to anybody who is concerned toknow what it is proposed to provide in the Prisoners of War or RedGross Conventions on those matters not dealt with in Part II.   i suggest that the United Kingdom delegation to a future -international conference should be authorised to act on the recommendations in Part IIIunless in any particular case specific instructions are given to theoontrary.457.   Part IV of the Report deals with matters which seem to me. to bestraight forward and on which no instructions are needed;   but againthey are recorded so that they are available for easy reference.458.    This Report has not been submitted to my Committee in draft,because to have done so would have involved some weeks further delay,and it seemed to me a matter of urgency that the questions calling for decision ,should be submitted to higher authority forthwith.   Forthe contents of the Report therefore, I am solely responsible:   but,thoughit has been produced under very great pressure, I have done my best to record accurately and fairly the recommendations, and the relevantarguments, which emerged from the deliberations of the Committeej   andI have consulted members of the Committee particularly interested onparagraphs about which I had any doubt.459    My Committee has had advice on certain questions, on which theyare&apos;exptrt, from  two members of the United Kingdom delegation to the1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts, who are no longer in theservice of the Crown, viz:- /Colonel ii.J.&quot; Phillimore, O.B.S., formerly Assistant Adjutant-General, Directorate of Prisoner a of war, tfar Office and one
of the prosecuting oounsel in the Chief War CriminalsTrials at Nuremberg, 1 5Mr. A.S. Weston, O.B.E., formerly Head of the Prisonersof War Information Bureau and of Casualties (P.W.) Branch,War Offioe,and these gentlemen have also freely given me the benefit of theiradvioe whenever I have asked for it.,460.   At the meeting when they discussed the use of the Red Cross flagand emblem,, my Committee also had the help of Mr. F.D.H. Pritchard,Legal Adviser to the Joint Committee of the Order of St. John of jerusalem and the British Red Cross Society, which, in this connectionmight be described as the &quot;continuation committee&quot; of the &quot;War Organisationof the Order and.the Society.   I have also consultedMajor-General Sir John Kennedy, G.B.E. , C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.,Sir Ernest Burdon, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., LL.D.,Vice-chairman and Deputy Chairman respectively of the War Organisation,on those matters whioh particularly affect the work of the Red Cross onbehalf of prisoners of war, and also on the use of the Red Cross emblem;and, on certain relief supply questions, Miss Aileen Johnson, formerlyAssistant Principal, F.4(P.W.), War Office and subsequently Chief  ,Exeoutive of the British Red Cross Mission in Washington during theSecond World War, also gave me valuable assistance.461.   I cannot close this Report without reference to the heavy-loss -the Committee suffered last autumn when Sir Harold Satow, K.C.M.G., O.B.E.,had a serious breakdown, leading to his final retirement from the ForeignOffioe.   Sir Harold&apos;s great knowledge of prisoner of war questions, hisripe judgment and homely humour were largely responsible for the position which the United Kingdom delegation established at the 1947 geneva conference of Government Experts.   These qualities were again in evidenoeat the earlier meetings of my Committee, and we have sorely missed hisoounsel on numerous occasions since.   Those of us who were privilegedto work with Sir Harold Satow during the Second World War and to serve under his leadership at Geneva in April 1947, are conscious of how greatis the debt prisoners of war from the British Commonwealth owe to him.It is good to know that he is again in health enjoying life at his home in the country.462.

INTER-DEPAEQMMTAL CQMITTEE ONTHE REVISION,OF THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS.REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN.O.R.G.C./F(48)S5l52APPENDIX B.- -APPENDIX B - REPORT OP THE ADMIRALTY SUB-CQfflilTTEEON THE PROPOSED MARITIME CONVENTIONPART I - introductory.    The International Conference of Government Experts held at Geneva in 1947 to revise the Prisoners of War end Sick and Wounded Conventions also produced thedraft of a new Maritime Convention to replace the Tenth Hague Convention of 1907.Your Sub-Commit tee, believing not only that the Tenth Hague Convention containsinherent weaknesses but that the events of two World Wars have made it out of date, welcome this initiative.    Bearing in mind that no serious attempt was made between the two World Wars to carry out modifications shown to be necessary bythe First, they consider that it is highly desirable to revise the Conventionbefore the lessons of the Second have been forgotten or forced into the backgroundby other events.    They consider, however, that in many respects the draftprepared by the 1947 Conference fails to take account of these lessens,    Theyhave therefore prepared a new draft.     The texts of the Tenth Hague Convention,the 1947 draft and your Sub-Committee&apos;s proposals are set out in parallelcolumns in Fart IV of this Appendix.     In order not to provoke disagreement atthe forthcoming international conference your Sub-Committee have adhered as closely as possible to the form and wording of the other texts, though they have felt it necessary to rationalize the order of the articles and, in particular to divide them up into four parts, viz. Personnel (provisions corresponding to thoseof the Geneva. Conventions, as modified by the Cossaittee), Hospital Ships, Rightsof Belligerent Warships and Miscellaneous Provisions.2.    The principle cause of obsolescence in parts of Hague X is of course thedevelopment (over forty years) of new forms of Naval warfare, including thedevelopment of submarine and aerial craft, weapons and methods of war.    Thosewho drafted the 1907 Convention had in mind the old-fashioned surface action atclose range and the seizure (as distinct from the sinking) of merchantmen.They were not called upon to consider the results of submarine warfare againstmerchant shipping or the effects of bombing attacks carried out by aircraftwhioh could not even see their target.    The importance of these factors will beapparent from the following commentary on some of the draft articles.    Thiscommentary has been divided into two sections. .(a) (Fart II of this Appendix).    Articles in which the Sub-Committee have proposed changes (or resisted changes proposed by the 1947 Conference),concerning which they consider ministerial decisions are required.(b) (Fart IH of this Appendix).    Articles involving less important changes,of.which Ministers will nevertheless, in your Sub-Committee^ opinion,wish to be. aware.Other changes can, if necessary, be seen from a comparison of the texts inPart IV of this Appendix but have not been separately discussed.PART II - PROPOSALS REQUIRING MINISTERIAL CONSIDERATION3.   Article J. (see also paragraphs 15, 16 and 27 below).    Your Sub-committee consider that a Convention whose main purpose is to apply the principles of the geneva Conventions (including the proposed new Civilian Convention) to maritimewarfare should begin with a general statement that, at sea, all persons who arewounded, sick or shipwrecked shall be respected and protected.A.
4.   Artiole 2 (see also paragraph 28 below).     Despite Articles 5 and 6 of theEleventh Hague Convention&quot; it was-the practice of both sides in the second world War not to release merchant seamen falling into their hands.     Article iof the new Prisoners of War Convention, to whioh this article refers, will includemerchant seamen (and civilian aircrew) among the categories to be treated asprisoners of war.5.   Artiole 3 (see also paragraph 29 below).    Since merchant seaman (and civilian aircrew), though enjoying the status of prisoners of war if detainedby the opposing belligerent, are not combatants, this article ensures that ifthey fall into neutral hands or are returned by the captor to their own countrythey shall not be interned or prevented from taking further part in the war, as&apos;they would generally be if they&quot; were caabatants.6.. Artiole 6 (see also paragraphs 17, 18 and 32 below).     The 1947 draft requires that particulars of the wounded, sick and dead shall be communicated to the opposing belligerent &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.     Your Sub-Committee are advised thatfor reasons of security it is often undesirable to announce at once the sinking of an enemy ship (e.g. a submarine whose loss might not otherwise be known toits high command for seme weeks).     It would clearly be best to leave this ideaout of the Convention altogether, but other delegations at the forthcoming conference are likely to press far something of this sort on humanitarian grounds,It is therefore proposed that the United Kingdom delegation should refuse toaccept anything more than that such particulars should be notified &quot;withoutunnecessary delay.&quot;7.   Article 9 (see alas paragraph 19 to 21 and 35 below).    During the Second1&apos; or Id War the United Kingdcm found it necessary for reasons of operationalsecurity to refuse to recognise the large number of small hospital shipsnotified by the enemy;   (a special, and obvious, case for refusal of immunity wasthat of air-sea rescue craft).     It is now generally accepted that to earnimmunity hospital ships should be of not less than a certain size and that smallboats, such as air-sea rescue craft, should rely on their speed for protection.. It is likely to be more difficult to reach agreement at the InxernationalConference on the actual minimum.    After hearing technical opinion yourSub-Committee recommend that the minimum should be 2,000 gross registered tons,but consider that the United Kingdom Delegation should be prepared, if necessary, jto accept 1,500 tons.    There is likely to be seme pressure from the netherlands government for a third category between hospital ships and air-sea rescue craft;but it is considered that this would too greatly complicate the Conventionwithout compensating advantage.8.   Article 15 (see also paragraph 41 below).     This article, which states thathospital ships shall forfeit their immunity if the^ commit acts harmful to theenemy and lays down certain things which shall not cause a hospital ship toforfeit immunity, is in many ways the most important./?.*Phe following is the text of Articles 5 and 6 of the EleventhHague Convention&quot;Article 5 - when an enemy merchant ship is captured by abelligerent, such of its crew as are nationals of a neutral state arenot made prisoners of war.The same rule applies in the case of the captain and officerslikewise nationals of a neutral state, if they promise formally inwriting not to serve on an enemy ship while the war lasts.Article 6 - The captain, officers and members of the crew,when nationals of the enemy state, are not made prisoners of war,on condition that they make a formal promise in writing not toundertake, while hostilities last, any service connected with theoperations of the war.&quot;\I
/part m -a     One of the most difficult problems facing the Conference will be to finda&apos;means of ensuring that hospital ships are not inadvertently attacked by anenemy who cannot see them and therefore does not know that they are hospital ships.It has been suggested that a radar device would be the best means;   but yourSub-Ccmmittee fear that this would be open to grave abuse.    They consider thatthe only safe method is to encourage hospital ships to broadcast their position,course and speed at regular intervals, so that aircraft may be aware that they arein the neighbourhood.    For operational reasons it is highly undesirable, however,that such broadcasting be made compulsory;   this would, for example, have givenaway the approach of our naval forces in the North African landings whenhospital ships were necessarily in attendance to succour the wounded.    At thesame- time such broadcasting must clearly be encouraged.    Your Subcommitteetherefore recommend that it should be laid down that a hospital ship does notforfeit its immunity by reason of &quot;having on board wireless telegraphy apparatuswithout which it would be unable to give from time to time due and adequatenotification of its position, course and speed.&quot;10.   Your Sub-Canalttee consider that Service women and the wives of Servicemen mav properly be carried in hospital ships during the last three months ofpregnfiiiey and during the three months following the birth of a child, whether ornot they are sick, wounded or shipwrecked;   they likewise consider that medioalpersonnel and chaplains over and above the staff of the hospital ship may properly be carried, whether or not they are sick, wounded or shipwrecked,    They do not recommend including in the Convention a provision to this effect, because theyconsider that the Convention should not be complicated by the inclusion of administrative details which experience has sheas, to be unnecessary;  but; theyconsider that it should be interpreted in future, as it was in the.past, ascovering these categories and they consider that if there is pressure at theConference for the inclusion of such a provision, the U.K. Delegation should be      -authorised to agree.11.   It is proposed to cover in the same way the carriage of medical suppliesover and above those required for use on board the hospital ship itself;   thisis regarded as a legitimate use of a hospital ship, but has been in the past amatter of some doubt.    It is proposed to resist the provision in Artiole 21 ofthe 1947 draft (see paragraph 55 below) granting immunity to other ships carrying medical supplies.12.  This article prohibits the use of codes and cyphers by hospital ships.The United States allowed the carriage of codes and cyphers in the last war far the receipt- of secret messages on the ground that otherwise they would not be ableto be informed of sudden changes of plan without jeopardizing operations.    Whilstthere is some force in this, your Sub-Committee feel that once codes and cyphersare carried there is no means of guaranteeing that they be not used for sendingmessages and that it is necessary to avoid this, since it opens the way toillicit military activity.13. Article 15 of the 1947 draft (see paragraph 53 below) lays down thatmerchant ships which have been transformed into hospital ships shall not be put to any other use throughout the duration of hostilities.    Your Sub-committee feel this to be unnecessarily restrictive and propose to emit it;   as it is notBritish practice to &quot;denotify&quot; hospital ships, however, they consider that theU.K. Delegation should be authorised to agree if necessary.Article 20 (see also paragraph 46).    The principle adopted by yourSub-Conmittee in regard to the use of aircraft for medical transport is simile?to that described under Article 9 (see paragraph 7 above) for air-sea rescuearaft:   aircraft must rely on their speed for protection.    There has been somefesire, exemplified by the 1947 draft, to find a formula that would giveJnmunity to hospital aircraft except in certain areas where operations were going*5  all such attempts are reduced to absurdity by considering the dilemma of theSQamanding officer of a warship having to wait to see the Bed Cross markings on anmidentified approaching aircraft before deciding whether to shoot at it.&amp;cept by special agreement between the belligerents, therefore, aircraft shouldlot be protected by the Convention.
FART III - PROPOSALS CP WHICH MINISTERS SHOULD BE AWARE.15. Article 1 (see also paragraphs 3 above and 27 below). Your Sub-Caanitte. Jthought it right to state specifically that the provisions in Part I of the pr,J^Convention apply not only to the shipwrecked strictly so-called, but also to twwho are forced to bale out from, or make forced landings in, aircraft.16.   It has also been made clear that -these provisions apply to those whoare shipwrecked from natural causes as well as by hazard of war.17.   Article 6 (see also paragraphs 6 above and 32 below).    This article should state explicitly for the first time that those covered by the Maritime Conventicniare on landing to be treated in accordance with the Prisoners of War. and Sick and wounded Conventions;   this has, of course, been the practice in the past.18.   In view of this position your Sub-Committee do not think it necessaryto require in the Maritime Convention the notification to the opposingbelligerent of the full range of particulars of sick, wounded and dead laid do%in the Prisoners of War and Sick and Wounded Conventions.19.   Article 9 (see also paragraphs 7 above and 35 below).    Whilst the sinking of a hospital ship even by way of reprisal for similar action by the enemy can never be justified, your Sub-Committee have considered whether the convention should not allow capture by way of reprisal.    They have come to the conclusion,however, that any attempt to insert such a provision would lead to a total prohibition on reprisals, which would not be to the United Kingdom&apos;s advantage.20. The Tenth Hague Convention lays down that the names of hospital ships must bjnotified to the opposing belligerent. It is recommended that at least the gross registered tonnage, the length from bow to stern, the number of masts and funnel&quot;and any other distinctive features should also be given.21.   The United States Delegation at the 1947 Conference proposed that notificatljshould be acknowledged, but the Conference felt, and your Sub-Committee agree,that this would give an ill-disposed belligerent an opporttxiity of refusing torecognize any hospital ships.22. Article 11 (see also paragraph 37 below). This article makes clear for thjfirst time that hospital ships are not only permitted but obliged to succour alljpersons who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked.23.   Article 12 (see also paragraph 38 below).    After receiving technical advic^your Subcommittee recamend a somewhat revolutionary scheme for marking andilluminating hospital ships.     They are the less reluctant to do so because theCanadian Delegation at the 1947 Conference proposed that, as the present marking!were far from ideal for recognition, hospital ships should be painted orange.The colour scheme now put forward is designed to bring about the recognition of hospital ship as soon as possible after it becomes visible.     There may be difficulty in persuading other delegations and the International Red cross committee to accept so radical a departure from the traditional colouring, butthis is a matter which should be governed by expediency and humanity and not by ]sentiment.    Moreover, because looked at up sun all ships appear only assilhouettes and are therefore indistinguishable from each other by colouring, Hflis still held that the white flag with the red oross is the best means of recognition from this angle.     The consequent flying of a large version of theRed Cross flag in addition to the painting will help to placate the sentimental,!24. Article 13 (see also paragraph 39 below). The 1947 draft emits altogether!Article 6 of the Tenth Hague Convention which prohibits the use of the Red Cross!for other purposes and the proposed text restores it with a slight modificatiaur25.   Article 17 (see also paragraph 43 below).     It is perhaps worthy of mentiongthat at the 1907 Conference the United Kingdom reserved their position on thearticle whioh provided that warships had the right to demand the surrender ofsick, wounded and shipwrecked on board hospital ships.     In practice we haveourselves frequently used this provision since and no objection is seen to i*sperpetuation in the new Convention.26.   A French proposal to exempt from this provision hospital ships whose route had been notified to the enemy is considered to derogate seriously from the immunity enjoyed by other hospital ships and it is proposed that all such proposals should be strenuously resisted.

Intheir report, the Sub-Committee were asked to oonsider the following ,aspects :-(a) the definition which we would prefer, bearing in mind our interest both in the protection of our own foroes whenoooupying enemy territory, and our interest in proteotingpersonnel engaged on special operations;(b) the maximum extent to which we oould go in considering the definition of a &quot;partisan&quot;; -(o)   points which must be avoided in any definition.Background information.2.

5.     The following draft prepared by Mr.- H.J. rhillimore was submitted -to the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts:-&quot;(a)   where individuals in an occupied territory form a military organisation to resist an occupying Power;(b)   /and gain effective, albeit temporary, control of a regiqn7(o)    then provided that the individual members of such an organisation:-: (i)   are led by a person responsible for his subordinates;(ii)   habitually and consistently display a fixeddistinctive sign recognisable at a distance;(iii)   carry arms openly;   and(iv)   provided that they comply with the rules of war andtreat those members of the Occupying Power captured by them in accordance with the principles of theConvention;(d)    it is the opinion of the nations that members of suchorganisations captured by the Occupying Power should receivesimilar treatment&quot;.Seven delegations at the Conference would not accept this statement, unless(b) were deleted:   five delegations regarded the clause as essential inorder to secure some objective test:    the remaining three delegations didnot declare their attitude.6.     The definitions iii paragraphs 4 and 5 above are similar except forthe disputed clause in sub-paragraph 5(b) and for the inclusion in sub-paragraph 5(c) (ii) of the words &quot;habitually and consistently&quot;.   the definition in paragraph 4 covers broadly what may be. termed the normalconception of an &quot;-irregular combatant&quot; or &quot;partisan&quot;.   Throughout thisReport, therefore, the term &quot;partisan&quot; is used to describe a member ofthe fighting organisation other than a regular member of the armed forces or &quot;camp Follower&quot;, and includes:-(a) an &quot;irregular combatant&quot;;    .(b) a member of a &quot;military organisation to resist an occupying power&quot;;(c) a member of the &quot;Home Guard&quot; or any similar organisation.The Sub-Committee have not considered the &quot;levy en masse&quot;.Conditions to be fulfilled by a &quot;partisan&quot;7.     The Sub-Committee considered it fundamental to preserve the principlerecognised-by International Law, that an enemy population is dividedinto two classes:-(a) the Armed Forces;(b) the peaceful population;and that each has distinct privileges, duties and disabilities.    &quot;Itis one of the purposes of the laws of war to ensure that an individualmust definitely choose to belong to one class or the other, and shallnot be permitted to enjoy the privileges of both;   in particular, thatan individual shall not be allowed to kill or wound members of the army of the opposed nation and, subsequently, if captured or. in danger of life, to pretend to be a peaceful citizen&quot;.    (Manual of Military Jjaw,chapter 14, paragraph 17).8.     The Sub-Committee recognise that, if this prinoiple is maintained in the full sense that it has hitherto borne, it will not be possible to
meat the very strongly expressed desires of&apos;the delegations at the1^47 Geneva Conference of Government Experts from those european countries which had experience as &quot;partisans&quot; in the Second itforldWar.    (Prance, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Czechoslovakia and Poland),They came to the conclusion that the statement of prinoiple inparagraph 7 above needs some modification to meet the conditions of modern warfare on a large scale.9.     The Sub-Committee suggest that the^essential charaoter of theprinoiple laid down in paragraph 1 above would be satisfied eventhough certain formations consisted of individuals who might becarrying out oivilian functions and military functions intermittently,so long as they did not attempt any military activity unless and until they had assembled under disciplined control and were satisfying allthe other conditions set out in sub-paragraph 5(c) above.   Clearly,if taken into o us tody whilst carrying out civilian functions and chargedwith some military activity, they would not secure the protection ofthe Prisoners of War Convention unless they first established, to the satisfaction of the Detaining Power;-(a) that they were bona fjde members of a recognisable &quot;partisan&quot;organisation;(b) that at the time of taking part in such military activity,they were conforming to the conditions laid down.10.   In putting forward this proposal, the Sub-Committee have takeninto consideration the following faotors:-(a) that, in their opinion, the Government of the UnitedKingdom had, during the Second World War, recognised this modification of the principle laid down in paragraph ,above, first, in the formation of the Home Guard, and,secondly, when General Eisenhower, as Supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, issued a proclamation to the effect that the forces of the French ResistanceMovement were part of his foroes and must be recognised as legitimate combatants;(b) that it was the minimum that was likely to meet the wishes of the &quot;partisan&quot; countries repres,ented at the 1947Geneva Conference of Government. Experts;(c) that &quot;partisans&quot; will, in any case, operate intermittentlyas oombatants and as civilians:    if, however, they are&quot;recognised&quot; and they can claim prisoner of war status,if captured, they will probably behave more humanelytowards the forces of the occupying Powers (french representatives, who had served in the Resistance Forces,at the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Expertsasserted that this would, in&apos;fact, be so).11.   The Sub-Comuittee realise, however, that the proposal has oertainobjections from the military operations point of view, viz:-(a) that the proposal would tend to increase the number ofinhabitants of an occupied territory who will join a&quot;partisan&quot; movement:    if an individual can be sure   of receiving prisoner of war status if captured as a &quot;partisan&quot;even though he continued to live his normal civilian lifeexcept when engaged on operations&quot;, then the major deterrent to becoming a &quot;partisan&quot; (fear of the consequences ifcaught) is removed;(b) the &quot;partisans&quot; would have a taotical advantage over theocoupying-forces, as it is impossible to define exactlyat what stage the individual should ctiange from aoivilian to a soldier and vice versa:    &quot;partisans&quot; could,for example, observe the locations and movements of the occupying forces, and concentrate their own forces whiledressed as civilians.12.   In addition, it is essential, in the view of the Sub-Committee,
that there should be some objective test of the &quot;partisan&quot; organisationitself and, as the test suggested at sub-paragraph 5(b) above failed tosecure general support at the 1947 Geneva Conference of GovernmentKxperts, the Sub-Couuuittee reooriaaend instead the following oondition:-&quot;that the headquarters of the organisation should have effective control of all the lower formations and units and shouldbe oapable of being oommunioated with.effectively and ofreplying to communications&quot;.The Sub-Committee.consider that this represents the utmost limit to which the  United Kingdom could go in order to meet the views of the french delegation and the delegations from other countries which were occupiedduring the Second World War.   It does not stipulate that the whereaboutsof the &quot;partisan&quot; headquarters should be.discolsed;   but it rests onthe view that no power could accept obligations towards a body with whichit was impossible to communicate.   The methods by which communicationswere sent to, and received from, resistance movements in the occupied countries during the Second World War were varied and many;    the Sub-Coiomittee suggest that this fact is well known &quot;and that the test theyoffer is, therefore, one capable of being applied objectively during any future war.13.   The Sub-Coiumittee think it desirable that any treaty obligationtowards &quot;partisans&quot; should most certainly be dependent on reciprocity(see sub-paragraph 5(c)(iv) above).   Nevertheless they have no doubt,at any rate so far as United Kingdom&apos;or other British Commonwealthforces are concerned, that they would, in fact, extend to &quot;partisans&quot;captured by them approximately the same treatment as was given torecognised prisoners of war, and. that this would be done for admin-istrative convenience as well as on humanitarian grounds.14. The Sub-Committee therefore recommend-that the conditions set outin sub-paragraph 5(o) above should be modified to exclude the words&quot;habitually and consistently&quot; from sub-paragraph 5(0)(ii) and that the objective test in sub-paragraph 5(h) above should be replaced by that,suggested in paragraph 12 above. The Sub-Committee consider, however,that the decision to accept this recommendation should be taken at thehighest level in&quot;view of the. factors set out in paragraphs 10 -and 11 above.Period during and conditions under whioh a &quot;partisan&quot; organisation maybe reoognised.15.   Possible conditions of &quot;occupation&quot;During the period 1939 to 1947 the term &quot;occupied territory&quot;might have been used to desoribe any of the&quot;following:-(a) part of the territory of another belligerent whileactive hostilities continued in another part of that territory;(b) territory of another belligerent when that belligerentcontinued active hostilities outside that territory(e.g. Norway after May.1940, Holland after June 1940,Greece after May 1942);(c) .territory-of another belligerent when active hostilities with the original Allies of that belligerent continued on or outside the- territory of that belligerent eventhough the belligerent itself may have capitulated(e.g. France after June 1940);(d) territory oocupied without the agreement of an indigenousGovernment, but without active hostilities (see alsosub-paragraph 16(b) below);(e) territory ocaupied in the face of hostilities, butvrithout the declaration of war (e.g. Togo-Slavia in1942);(f) territory held by each side during a civil war.
In the view of the Sub-Committee, having regard to the laws ana usagesof war, &quot;partisans^ operating.in territories falling within any of the categories set out above,, oould be recognised as entitled to the 4 nproteotion of the Prisoners of War Convention (and other laws of war)    loprovided that they satisfied the tests of recognition described inparagraph 12 above.16.   In-the following oases, however, the Sub-Committee do not considerthat &quot;partisans&quot; oould be recognised unless the conditions amountedto &quot;civil war&quot; in which case they would fall under sub-paragraph 15(f)above (see also sub-paragraph 18(b)(14) below):-(a) territory of another belligerent, when all hostilities, whether.inor outside that territory have ceased, but nopeace treaty has been enforced:, this oould occur where &apos;a country is occupied either:-     -(i). by one&quot; or more victorious powers without speciallegal arrangementsj   or.  (ii)   under special legal arrangements (e.g, Germany 1945);(b) territory occupied with the agreement      an indigenous./ Government, ?%t- without active, hostilities.. (see alsosub-paragraph 15(d) above); -(c) Colonial, mandated or trustee territory in which arebellion is in progress.Reoommendat ions    .17.   The Sub-Committee therefore reoommend that &quot;partisans&quot; should be protected by the Prisoners of War Convention, if captured: -(a)   whilst operating in any territory covered by paragraph 15;and (b)   whilst belonging to a force:-(i)   which had informed the occupying Power of-the distinctive sign to be worn by its members(see (o)(ii) below); .(ii)   which has dedlared its existence to the enemy;(iii)   whose headquarters have effective oontrol of allthe lower formations and units;(iv)   whose headquarters are capable of beingcommunicated with effectively and of replying to communications;(v)   which complies with the rules of war and treatsmembers of the Armed Forces of the oooupyingPower captured by them in accordance with the prisoners of War Convention; and(o)   individually and at all times whilst operating as. &quot;partisans&quot;:(i)   are commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;(ii)   display a fixed distinctive, sign recognisable at- a distance and of whioh the occupying Power hasbeen previously informed (see (b)(i) above);(iii)   carry arms openly;(iv) comply with the rules of war and treat membersof the Armed Foroes of the occupying Powercaptured by them in accordance with the Prisonersof War Convention.18.   The Sub-Committee further reoommend:-
that the conditions under which &quot;partisans&quot; should be able&quot;oo claim the protection of the Prisoners of War convention should not be widened further than recommended in paragraph17 above;that care should be taken to avoid any wording which might enable the protection of the Prisoners of War convention to be claimed for:-(i) persons using armed force who do not wear arecognisable uniform or carry arms openly;(ii) spies and the like;(iii)   persons attacking regular troops treaoherouslyor under conditions where the troops have noreason to apprehend hostilities and take reason-able precautions to defend themselves;(iv)   persons who take subversive aotion against alegally constituted government unless suohsubversive action becomes a state of civil war;(v)   a person who uses arms against occupying forcesentirely on his own individual initiative;(vi)    bodies who do not conform to the rules andusages of war and of the Prisoners of war convention.

(see ieporE - paragraphs -jjg, 298,354 and 383) --1.     The Sub-Committee on the Treatment of: Women was appointed at the 10thmeeting of the Committee &quot;to consider and report whether any furtherprovisions regarding the treatment of women were necessary&quot;.2.    The Sub-Committee held one meeting and its conolusions were unanimous.It examined^the position of women in the light of the considerations set outin C.R.G.C./P(48)23, 24 and 25 and with particular regard to the difficulties experienced by members of the Nursing Servioes who were captured in the far east during the Second World War.       -Means of Identification.3.   The Sub-Committee regard as of the highest importance: -(a) that all members of the Nursing Services or of the Women&apos;sServioes should in war-time be olothed in a distinctive uniform and wear badges;(b) that notification should be made to all adverse belligerents,as in the case of the male foroes, of the ranks, titles, ,uniforms and badges of the Nursing Services and the Women&apos;sServioes, irrespective of whether they have a military or civilian status, so that the enemy may recognise them asprotected by the Prisoners of War Convention, the Red GrossConvention and&apos; the,&apos; 10th Hague Convention- qp any futureConventions which may take their place;(o)   that the necessary machinery should be set up to ensure thatthese things are done and that every woman concerned isprovided, in time of war, with a proper identity certificate.These recommendations are made because the military nursing personnel captured in the Far East in the Second World War had the greatest difficulty inconvincing the Japanese military authorities that they were entitled to theprotection of the 1929 Geneva Wounded and Sick Convention, and that theyshould therefore be respected and treated with humanity.Standards of Treatment,4.     The Sub-Committee are satisfied that the provisions proposed in the prisoners of WaT Convention for safeguarding the treatment of prisoners of war are generally appropriate and adequate to secure, if observed, the propertreatment of women, subject to specific additional -provisions being includedto ensure that separate accommodation is provided for women for sleeping andfor hygiene arrangements.Disciplinary Provisions.,5.     The Sub-Committee take the view that it would be impracticable to attemptto secure a speoial disciplinary or judicial code for application to women who may be made prisoners of war.   Cases did, however, occur in the Par Eastin the Second World War where women were imprisoned in male prisons.   TheSub-Committee reoommend that a provision should be embodied in any futurePrisoners of War Convention requiring separate aooommodation to be provided forwomen undergoing disciplinary or judicial sentences in confinement and thatthey should be under the immediate care and supervision of women.Work.6.     The Sub-Committee are satisfied that the safeguards set out in the
Prisoners of .ar Convention to protect, prisoners of war from doing workfor which they ai&apos;e not suited or physically fit are generally adequate;but having regard-to the work which is normally expected from women insome countries, they consider that it would be desirable, if at all   *possible, to protect women who may be made prisonerstof war from being required to undertake unduly heavy work^ such as timber-felling, heavylifting, etc. which might well cause serious physical harm to them.The Sub-Committee recognise that to find a suitable form of words tosecure this result will not be easy.   They reoommend that the DraftingSub-Committee should be invited to give special attention to this problem. * .
Appendix  3EVISI0N OF TUB GENEVA OQKVBiflMQHSREPORT BY THE QiAlBiANAem^IXr a .- IMPORT OP THE TEGHMIGAL Y/OiKHJO PARTY ON OOi^El^ATION&apos;,see Keport - paragraphs lUB(g) and 113&apos;)--- PART I - OCMPENSATION prime INJURIES AT WOHC1.     British service men who, on or: after discharge from the foroes, suffer from disablement due to their internment as prisoners of war, whether as aresult of employment or otherwise, are eligible for awards under-the WarPensions codes.   We therefore consider that a prisoners own governmentshould.be responsible for compensating him, after his repatriation, inrespect of any disability due to his employment during his internment as a prisoner of war.&quot;2.     In considering the position during captivity we had regard to thefollowing: - .    .(a) In Great Britain, the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Aots will soon besuperseded by the National Insurance (industrial Injuries) Act,under whioh an.employed person and his employer will both payweekly contributions in order to provide financial benefits inrespect of incapacity or death due to accidents duringemployment.(b) As there is no contract of employment between the employer andthe prisoner of war we do not think that the new Act as it stands would apply to a prisoner of war in this oountry.Moreover, the benefits provided under the Act include long termor permanent awards, e.g. widows&apos; pensions^ and as stated inparagraph 1, we are not in favour of compensation being paid bythe Detaining Power after the prisoner&apos;s repatriation.(c) We considered whether it would be desirable that provision shouldbe made.for some extra payment to be made to a prisoner, injuredat work, while he was in hospital or otherwise undergoingtreatment.   We reached the conclusion that it would be unwise to distinguish, for example, between two prisoners of war in hospital, one of whom was injured at work, and the other wasinjured in the camp.3.     tfe are, therefore, in agreement with the conclusions in sub-paragraph(a) and (b) of paragraph 11 of 0.R.G,0. /p(47)20, whioh are as follows:-&quot;(a)   that the Detaining Power should not be required to pay anymonetary compensation to prisoners of war in respect ofinjuries arising out of work;(b)    that compensation for such injuries should be the responsibilityof the prisoner*s own Government.&quot;PART II - DOCOMifl^jation  OP -DiJURIES AMD -DISiiiASES4.   The Ministry of Pensions representative stated that in consideringentitlement to compensation under the War Pensions codes, it isimmaterial whether the disablement or death of a British prisoner of warduring his internment was due to his employment or not.   The ministry would, therefore, like to have the fullest information possible of themedical history of all British prisoners of war during their.?*PnviJr.since the difficulties are those where no claim arises until years alterrepatriation. -5     tie aonsider that Article 14 of the Convention should provide that aku  ?g  should  t oblged to send to the Central Agency a record of aU^issions to hospital showing dates of ^sslonflandrd&quot;^fg^eand naturS of illness and treatment given.   A prisoner of wax should be
given a certificate containing this information if he requests it.1?* realise that this appears to be a more onerous provision than thatin Artiole 14, but as prisoners should be made aware of the provisions ofthe Convention, many, if not most of them, would, in any event, avail themselves of the provisions of Articles 14 and 27 as amended, asproposed by the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Experts.   In thisconnection we note that it is proposed that copies of certificates underArticle&apos; 14 are to be sent to the Central Agency whereas under Artiole 27it is proposed they shall be sent to the International Red Cross.6.     If, however, it.is decided that it is not practicable to legislate for information being given to the Central Agency (or I.R.C.) in every case, then we would reoommend that Articles 14 and 27 should be amended as proposed by the 1947 Conference, subject to the point mentioned above as to the destination of the duplicate certificates, and possibly tosome drafting amendments to - the&quot;provision relating to &quot;certificates&apos;-lit&apos;&apos;Artiole 27.    &apos;PART IH - COMPENSATION FOR PERSONAL EFFECTS LOST BY PRISONERS-     - OF WAR AFTER CAPTURE *&quot;&quot;*&quot;- &apos;7.    In view of the experience of the 1939/k5 war, we are of the opinionthat, as a matter of principle, a prisoner of war who loses personaleffects after Capture should not fare better in the matter of compensationthan a soldier who loses his personal effects in battle.&apos;  8.    Although there are divergencies between the three British Servioesit is the general policy to refuse to pay for the personal effects ofsoldiers, sailors and airmen lost in. battle, the exception being losses due to marine war risk in respect of which insurance can be effected.9.     In practice, the adoption of the principle stated in paragraph 7would mean that British prisoners of war would not receive compensation from the British Government for personal effects lest during captivity.10.   We are of the opinion that, if merchant seamen are to be given theprotection of the Convention the British merchant seaman Who loses hiseffeots after capture should not receive more favourable terms in thematter of compensation than that given to the seaman who loses hiseffects as a result of enemy action at sea.11.   We note that the 1947 Geneva Conference of Government Expertsproposed that Article 6 of the Convention should be amended to allowarticles of value, -as well as sums of money, to be taken from prisonersby order of an officer.   While we appreciate the need for such amend-ment (from the security point of view) we consider that the Articleshould specifioally.provide for the return to the prisoner of thearticles taken from him,when he is repatriated. &apos;12.  Having regard to the foregoing considerations we are in agreementwith the view expressed in sub-paragraph 11(c) of C. R, G. C. /P(47) 20, viz:-Hthat where personal effects of a prisoner of war were lost in circumstances for which a Detaining Power or its agentsmight be held responsible, any claim for compensation shouldbe dealt with by the prisoher&apos;s own Government, except that .the Detaining Power should be required to replace free of charge to the prisoner of war any article whioh he needs for personal use during captivity.&quot;We are, however, of opinion that nothing should be stated in the convention as to payment of compensation 3ince if it were provided that compensation was the liability of the prisoner&apos;s own Government, theft of his valuablesmight be encouraged or, at any rate, would be more likely to occur.Moreover, such a provision in ah international Convention might be quotedagainst the principle set out in paragraphs 7 and 9 if this were officiallyadopted by this oountry.   This principle would almost certainly be challenged by some when our prisoners of-war weie repatriated, and itmight be very difficult to hold it if the Convention specifically statedthat compensation was a matter for the prisoners own Government.
PART IV - Stt&amp;LiRY OF HaCaijMDATIONS13.    (a)   The Detaining Power should not be required to pay any monetarycompensation to prisoners of war in respect of injuries fromaccidents at work; - -       &apos; * &apos;\b)   compensation for such injuries should be the responsibilityof ;he prisoner&apos;s own Government;(c) provision should be made for information to be sent to theCentral Agency (or International Red Cross) as to alladmissions to hospital, giving, dates of admission anddischarge.and nature of illness and treatment;(d) if (o) is impracticable, Articles 14 and 27 should be amended as proposed by the 1947 Geneva Conference ofGovernment Experts;(e) if Article 6 is amended to authorise the removal of valuablearticles belonging to prisoners of war, there should be a specific provision for the return of the articles onrepatriation;(f) where personal effects of a prisoner of war are taken from him and are not returned to him in repatriation, any claim for compensation should be dealt with by his own government but the Detaining Power should be required to replace, free of charge, any article which is necessary for his personaluse during captivity: but nothing should be stated in theConvention as regards payment of compensation.- Ill
