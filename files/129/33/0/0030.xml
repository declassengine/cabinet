(49) 30).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,23rd March, 1949.ECONOMIC report . Man-power the Ministry of Labour&apos;s new man-power statistics, based on the numberof contributors under the national insurance schemes, show that the total working population rose in January by 29,000 owing to the intake of school-leavers afterthe Christmas holidays.. . 2. There were increases in January in the number of men and women onrelease leave who had not taken up employment and in the number of registeredunemployed; The total number in civil employment remained almost unchangedat just over 22 million.3. The number of persons unemployed, which rose from 327,200 at6th December to 375,700 at 10th January, declined to 360,300 at 14th February.This represented about 1-8 per cent, of the total number of employees insuredunder the national insurance schemes.4. Total man-power in the manufacturing industries increased in Januaryby 26,000 to 8,227,000. Employment was greater in all main groups except food,drink and tobacco. There were increases of 11,000 in the metals, engineering-and vehicles group, 9,000 in clothing and 6,000 in textiles (2,000 in cotton and1,000 in wool).5. In the basic industries reductions of 5,000 in agriculture and 2,000 inttransport and communication offset increases of 3,000 in gas, electricity and water and 1,100 in coal-mining. ,6. There was a seasonal fall in January of 15,000 employed in building andcontracting. Employment in the distributive trades, which declined in December,fell further in January by 4,000.II. -Production7. The index of total industrial production (1946 = 100) declined seasonallyin December to 123. The index for January is estimated provisionally at 124.For the manufacturing industries the index was 125 in December.36719 B
8. Compared with the corresponding months of 1947 the level of industrial production during the fourth quarter of 1948 showed about the same improvementas that recorded in the third quarter.Interim.

The weekly output of deep-mined coal in February was 4,092,000 tons,almost exactly the same as in November last. This represented an increase of4-5 per cent, over the level of output in February 1948. Production this year has been exceeding the provisional weekly targets and total production of deep-mined coal for the first eleven weeks of the year amounted to 44-5 million tons .1 - 02 million tons more than in the corresponding period of last year.Output of Deep-mined Coal(Weekly averages)	1947-48 Th. tons	1948-49 Th. tons	Change Per cent.November......	4,000	4,094	4 2-4December and January  ...	3,760	3,864	4 2-8February   ...     ...	3,915	4,092	4 4-5March, 1st week ...	3,991	4,084	&apos; 4 2-32nd week ...	3,980	4,128	4 3-73rd week ...	4,031	4,112 ,.	4 2-010. Output per man shift at the coal face continues to rise slowly and inthe second week of March was 3-04 tons. For five successive weeks it has beenabove 3 tons. Absence from work, however, rose steadily from 13-96 per cent,in the second week of January to 15-86 per cent, in the first week of March andwas appreciably higher than in the corresponding period of last year.Man-power, Absence from Work and Productivity at the Coalface	Workers at coalface (thousands) 1948           1949		Absence from work at coalface (per cent.) 1948           1949		Output per man shift at coalface (tons) 1948           1949	February 				14-96	2-91	2-981st week ....	291	297	14-69			2nd week ...	291	297	14-53	15-41	2-95	3-023rd week ...	291	298	13-87	15-61	2-92	3-014th week ...	292	298	14-10	15-65	2-92	3-03March 						1st week ...	292	298	13-75	15-86	2-93	3-012nd week ...	292	298	14-28	15-67	2-93	3-0411. Total distributed stocks of coal amounted to 11-09 million tons at12th March 2-54 million tons less than a year ago, but 5-88 million tons greaterthan at 15th March, 1947.
Iron, and Steel12. The output of steel ingots and castings rose to 316,000 tons in the-first week of February and the weekly average for the month of 311,000 tons wasthe highest ever recorded, exceeding, the previous high level of 303,000 tons aweek achieved in November. This further expansion in steel production was duelargely to increased supplies of both imported and home-produced scrap. Pig-iron production, though greater than in January, was less than in November 1948.Stocks of scrap declined in February but are expected to be maintained at just over 50Q;000 tons during March and April. Stocks of pig-iron also, declined inFebruary but are expected to rise to 500,000 tons by the end of April.Textiles13. The output of cotton yarn (including cotton-waste yarn) rose to18-18 million lb. in the first week of February but declined to 17-70 million lb.in the first week of March. This was below the rate of 18 -27 million lb. a week inOctober 1948 and the post-war peak of 18-36 million lb. a week in November.14. Production of rayon yarn in January attained a new high level of13-8 miUion lbs.^1-1 per cent, greater than the previous high level in november and. 13 per cent, above the level in January. 1948. Output of staple fibre also-rose in January but was still below the level reached last September.. 15, Output of other textiles also rose in January but was still -below thehighest levels attained in 1948.Motor vehicles16. The number of passenger cars produced rose to 7,478 a week in February-exceeding the previous record of 7,232 a week achieved in June 1948. Theproportion of these cars produced for export declined again to 63-6 per1 cent,compared with; an average of 74-1 per cent, in the second quarter of 1948 andthe number produced for the home market rose from 1,972 a week in the last quarter.of-1948.to.2,718 a week in February. The number of large passenger cars(over 2,2Q0 c.c.) produced for export declined in February.Weekly output of passenger cars ^including chassis)	Percentage of total passenger car production for export	number (over	r of large passei - 2,200 c.c.) pro	iger cars duced		Total	For home market	For export1948 1st Quarter         ... 2nd Quarter. -       ... 3rd Quarter-4th Quarter 1949 January     ......

The value of exports of passenger ears to the United States declinedsharply from an average of  634,000 a month in the last quarter of 1948 to 186,000 in February.

18. Production of commercial vehicles also rose in January to 3,892 a week^-a rate exceeded only in October last. Production was only slightly lower inFebruary. 1,981 vehicles a week were produced for export compared with theprevious record of 1,984 a week in September 1948. it-III.-Building19. The number of new permanent houses (excluding aluminium. houses)completed rose in February to 15,606. 15,367 new houses were started in February,so that the number of houses under construction was reduced by only 239 to186,591 at the end of the month.20. New contracts, which declined from 18,435 in December to 14,507 inJanuary, rose to 15,297 in February.IY.-External Trade21. The final figures of overseas trade in the short month of Februaryshow a drop in the value of British exports to  140 - 7 million from the recordlevel of  159 - 2 million achieved in January. The volume of exports in Februaryis provisionally estimated at 143 per cent, of the volume in 1938. The value ofimports, however, fell from  187-2 million in January to  162-0 million inFebruary and the adverse visible balance (exports and re-exports (f.o.b.) lessimports (c.i.f.)) declined further from  22-9 to  16-9 million the lowest levelsince July 1946.22. Although the value of British exports to the Western Hemisphere rosefurther to  26-5 million in January this represented only 16-7 per cent, of total british exports compared with 17-6 per cent, in the last quarter of 1948; Thevalue of exports to the United States rose to  5 - 95 million in January comparedwith a monthly average of  5 - 60 during the last quarter of 1948 but the proportionof our total exports going to the United States fell from 3-9 to 3-7 per cent.Exports to Canada and Newfoundland declined in January both in value and asa proportion of total exports.British Exports to the Western Hemisphere(Monthly averages)	Total to Western Hemisphere	To United States	To Canada and New-foundland	Per cent, of total British exports						To Western Hemisphere	To United : States	To Canada and  New-foundland	  million					1938        ......	6-9	1-7	2-0	17-7	4-4	5-01947        ......	14-9	40	3-7 /	15-7	4-2	3-91948 1st    Quarter	20-5	5-8	5-1	17-4	4-9	4-42nd   Quarter	20-3	5-1	5-8	15-6	3-9	4-53rd   Quarter	21-8	5-7	6-2	16-1	4-2	4-64th   Quarter	25-5	5-6	6-9	17^6	3-9	4-71949 January	26-5	5-9	5-8	16-7	3-7	3-6Y. Balance of Payments23. The gold and dollar deficit in February was again fairly low  21 millioncompared with  19 million in January. Expenditure on imports as a whole hasnot been running significantly below the programme. But drawings by the restof the sterling area have been comparatively light and Colonial receipts, particu-larly from West African cocoa and Malayan tin, have been heavy and a gooddeal in excess of earlier forecasts. We paid $7 million to Belgium in February,following $11 million in January. Even so the drain was lower than had been expected.   Much the same applies to Switzerland where, in the two months
-January-February we lost only $1-5 million. In general the dollar deficit islikely to be higher over the next few weeks than recently.24. E.C.A. reimbursements, during the month amounted to $80 million,including $4. million to Eire. In addition we received aid under letter of commit-ment procedure and in the shape of commodities obtained from United StatesGovernment Departments amounting to $9 million, making a total of $89 million in all. ,We drew $10 million more from the Canadian credit, while India drew$24 million from the International Monetary Fund. Total available resources,1therefore, amounted to $123 million ( 30^ million) to meet a gold.and dollar deficit of  21 million. The excess was reflected in an increase in our gold and dollar holdings which rose from  405 million to  474 million during February.25. Sterling liabilities fell by  58 million in January, divided about equally-between the sterling and non-sterling areas. India continues to draw heavily on her sterling reserves (they fell by  31 million during the month), while thedrop in South African holdings has recently been accelerated. Declines were fairly widespread in the non-sterling area, though some countries, e.g., Italyand Sweden, showed a small increase.YI. prices import and Export Prices26. The new index numbers iof import and export prices (1947=100)-showed&apos;no change in January compared with December. ; The index of import prices rose from 107 in January 1948 to 115 in July and to 117 in January1949. The index of export prices rose from, 106 in January to 110 in July andto 113 in January 1949. Although there has been no further worsening in the-terms of trade since July 1948, the continued rise in export prices will make it more difficult to sell our goods abroad. .Retail Prices   . . &apos;.   , ,27. The index of retail prices (June 1947-100) was unchanged again in,February at 109. The index of food prices increased to 109, and the index of clothing prices rose further to 117. There were no significant changes in theindices for other groups.Wholesale Prices , , s     ,::..r; ,-.     &apos;      .!28. The Board Of Trade index of wholesale i prices (1938 = 100) wasunchanged again in February at 218. The index for basic industrial materialsdeclined slightly owing to reductions in the prices of raw cotton, wool, fuel oil and rubber; but prices of jute, cotton yarns and cloths and wool noils increased.For the first time since September the index of non-ferrous metal prices showedno change.Prices in the United States29. The index of wholesale prices of farm products in the United Statesdeclined again in February from 253 to 245 (1948-100). Moody&apos;s index of staplecommodity prices, hoWever, has shown little movement since the middle ofFebruary. On 8th March the price of lead was reduced by 2 cents a lb. (about10 per cent.), and this was followed a Week later by a further fall of 1^ cents.This represents the first serious break in the level of non-ferrous metals prices.The price of lead has been abnormally high and some reduction, had been expectedas a consequence of the falling demand by the automobile industry.YIL-Wage Rates30.   The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100)remained unchanged in February at 108.. 31. Increases in wage rates which became effective in January addedapproximately  68,000 to the weekly wage bill of about 450,000 workers. the increases were spread over a wide range of industries. . The principal groups of work people affected were those employed in the iron and steel and engineering industries, in certain branches of the textile industry and in milk distribution.32. The six-monthly cost-of-living review in the building industry has now taken place and an increase representing Is. lOd: a week for craftsmen with
corresponding increases for other workers will operate from 7th February. Tha-.rise from 108 to 109 in the Interim Index of Retail Prices in November will result/in sliding scale increases in Eebruary in the hosiery trade and in the iron andsteel and tinplate industries. The Railway Staff Tribunal has rejected the claim,by the National Union of Railwaymen for an increase of 12s. 6d. a week for;half a million workers which would have cost about  22 million a year. Thistfollows similar decisions on claims against the Hotels Executive and london transport Executive.33. The most important new claims presented in January concern therspinning and manufacturing sections of the cotton industry and the claim in theyelectricity supply industry for a general revision of the wages structure the, firstsmajor wages claim since the industry was nationalised. This claim would resultin increases of 5s. Qd. a week for the majority of employees. Wages were lastincreased by 5s. 6d. a week in March 1948. There is also a series of claims for-various grades of employees in the Health Services.YIII. European Recovery ProgrammeO.E.E.C.34.   As forecast in paragraph 38 of my last Report, the Ministerial Com-mittee of Nine met in February to consider the structure of O.E.E.G.   It was.decided that the Chairman of the Council should, whenever he considered it useful,invite the Government of each country which is a member of the Executive?Committee to designate a Minister to form with him a Consultative Group to assist,him in guiding the work of the Organisation.   The Consultative Group would&apos;meet for a week at a time about every two months.;  It was also decided that the;Council should meet at Ministerial level as frequently as might be. necessary for/the conduct of the work of the Organisation, and at least four times a year.   The?&apos;Consultative Group met in the first week in March and considered on the basis of&quot;a United Kingdom memorandum, methods to be adopted for carrying out the plan of Action for 1949-50, which had previously been agreed by the Council at ministerial level.   The Plan of Action is based on the following eight principles^which are stated to be essential to the success of the European recovery programme:  ;   &apos; :(1) 1949 must be a year of financial and monetary stabilisation in Europe.(2) A rapid increase in exports and in invisible, earnings^, particularly fromtourism and shippings(3) Re-examination of current import programmes to curtail dollar imports,:not vitally needed. , ...(4) Elimination of internal disequilibrium in Europe, assisted by an adequate-system of in tra-European payments.(5) Investment and modernisation projects to be developed rationally and! in concert. &apos;  &apos;(6) A system to be devised for co-ordination of investments where-practicable,and for the exchange of information needed for common decisions;(7) A start to be made on the problem of surplus population in-certain partsof Europe.(8) Annual reports on progress achieved to be submitted for consideration-by the Executive Committee of O.E.E.C. -The Consultative Group reached decisions on the immediate steps to be taken,both by participating countries individually and by the Organisation, for givingpractical effect to these principles. The decisons do not entirely correspond withthe proposals put forward by the United Kingdom, which have been weakenedin a number of respects, but the main lines of. action which we believe essential to european recovery have been agreed.Congressional Hearings35. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has now reported on the amending legislation, including proposals submitted by E,C.A.for an. approprja-tion for, the fifteen months, April 1949 to June 1950. The Committee has not suggested a reduction, of the figures,.proposed by E.C.A. for. ail participating countries, viz., $1,150 million for April to June 1949, $4,280 million for the yearJuly 1949 to June 1950 and $150 million for long-term projects. These proposals have, however, still to be considered by the Appropriations Committee.
Division of A id for 1949-5036. The question of the principles to be adopted in the division of aid for1949-50 by O.E.KC. after the sum has been approved by Congress, and the date by which this must be completed, are at present under discUssibn in Paris a,hclLondon.United Kingdom Allotment of Aid for 1948-4937. - Every effort is being made to get the allotment of $11,313 million, tq theUnited Kingdom for the period of April 1948 to March 1949 fully committed by april 3rd, as there is a risk that any funds not committed by that date mighthave to be surrendered. A complete programme has been submitted to theEconomic Co-operation Administration in Washington, but against this pro^gramme procurement authorisations to, an amount over $150 million have still tobe issued by E.C.A- The United Kingdom Treasury and Supply Delegation in washington are doing their utmost to get E.C.A. to issue the authorisations intime.&quot; f, - )) &quot;:&apos;: &apos;&apos;\y.v &apos;,.&apos;v. -, W,&apos;.

An agreement was signed on 16th February between the United KingdomGovernment and the Export-Import Bank covering an additional loan of $3 million to the United Kingdom. The terms and conditions are the same as thoseapplicabletbthe 1310 million loan previously granted! This raises to &apos;f 313 million the total of aid available t6 the United Kingdom on a loan basis out of F.C.A.&apos;first appropriation. ;Second Report on Operdtidns &apos;39. The Second Report on Operations, covering the fourth calendar quarter-of 1948, has been issued as Cmd. 7654.ix,-Dollar Earnings of Colonial Commodities40. In view of the heavy reliance placed on the colonial dollar surpius inthe Long-Term Programme the recent trdnd in the prices and dollar earnings ofthe main colonial commodities is disappointing.        ,!41. As the following table shows, the major part of gross colonial earnings of United States and Canadian dollars is derived from three commodities only,rubber, tin and cocoa.   These are discussed below.42. This table shows the value of United States and Canadian imports fromthe Colonies. A deduction, necessarily somewhat arbitrary, has been made forMalayan entrepot trade in Indonesian rubber, since, although this was substan-tial before the war and in 1947, agreements since concluded with the netherlands government are likely to result in future in the resale to Indonesia of dollarsearnedin this way. In the case of Canada the value of sugar imports from british west Indies has been omitted, since sugar, unlike the other commodities included,is a net dollar import of the sterling area and not a net dollar earner. The figures are necessarily only approximate.It is doubtful whether much more than another f 10 million can be addedfor dollar earnings in American Account countries.		$ million		1937	1947	1948*United States      ...      ...	265	370	380Canada     .........	30	50	80Total   ...	295	420	460of which Rubber	130	240	180Tin       ......	85	30	70Cocoa   ......	30	80	110Other    ......	50	70	100Total   ...	295	420	460* Based on figures for January/October (United States) and January/September (Canada).
Rubber43. Rubber accounts for something varying between a third and a half of&quot;total colonial dollar earnings. The amount of these earnings depends on threevariables, the total purchases of natural rubber by the United States, the propor-tion of those total purchases supplied by British territories, and the price.Earnings in 1948 were lower than in 1947, because, while total imports of naturalrubber into the United States were about 728,000 tons in 1948 as against684,000 tons in 1947, the production of rubber in Indonesia greatly increased in.1948, and British territories therefore got a smaller share of the total supplies to the United States. Prices in 1948 were about 5 per cent, higher than in 1947&apos;and about a third higher than in 1937. The current price, however, is about 15 percent, below the 1948 average. The future of rubber prices and dollar earnings,from rubber depends very largely on the course of events in Indonesia. Continuedrecovery in rubber production there would further reduce our share in the UnitedStates market and if it goes far enough would bring rubber into surplus supplyand so lead to a very sharp fall in price. A surplus of production over commercialconsumption requirements does&quot; in fact already exist, but so far stockpile purchasesby the United States (and perhaps the U.S.S.R. also) have filled the gap. If a surplus does arise it is doubtful whether under present conditions in Indonesiaa restriction scheme could be effectively administered.44.   The rubber position would be much improved how or in the future if the-Americans could be persuaded to cut back the production pf synthetic and so allow-a larger import of natural rubber.   It will be one of the major objectives of the-United Kingdom Delegation at the forthcoming meeting of the Rubber study group to press this policy on the United States Delegation.Tin    r    ;-   -t&apos;1 ;y;k* 7 .....45.   The outlook here is brighter, since Malayan production has not yet fully-recovered from the effects of the war, and as it increases, sales to the United states should expand.    It is true that a surplus of production over commercial con-sumption requirements is beginning to show itself, but whether or not there is;some form of international agreement on tin United States stockpile purchasesshould cover any gap for several years ahead.   The Americans may drive a hard&apos;bargain for these stockpile purchases, but we may hope that the increase in the-quantity sold will more than offset the effect on earnings of lower prices.Cocoa     &apos;46. As a result of a spectacular increase in prices after the lifting of the-Office of Price Administration ceiling, cocoa, which was relatively unimportantpre-war, was the second most important dollar earner in 1947 and 1948. Thisrise in prices is a result partly of the general increase in world demand andpartly of decreased supply in the Gold Coast due to the spread of swollen shootdisease. This season, however, exceptionally good weather conditions have ledto a very large crop and prices have fallen by a half. While they may recoverwith more normal crops in later seasons, the more extreme boom in cocoa pricesseems to be over. Other fats and oils can, if necessary, be used as a substitute-for cocoa butter and the fall in their price in the United States will set a limit to cocoa prices in that market.Future Outlook47.   Any forecast is necessarily hazardous in the extreme.   But on balance itseems probable that the decline in rubber and cocoa earnings will more than offsetany increase in earnings from tin or other commodities.  On the other hand, as.production of sugar in the sterling area increases and purchases can be made-from non-dollar sources, we may in a few years&apos; time be net earners of (Canadian)dollars through our sugar transactions.
