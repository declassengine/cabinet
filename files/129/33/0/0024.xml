V,IV; L&apos;      &quot;-i&apos;;&apos; &apos;THE SUEZ CANAL     .MfeM&amp;ftANSUM by Tffls Secretary sjf State for Foreksn Affairs i -MY colleagues may like to have the following information regarding thenegotiations between the Egyptian Government and the Suez Canal company which began on 7th January and were concluded by the signature of an agreement on 7th March. This Agreement, the full text of which is not yet available, is subject to ratification by the Egyptian Parliament and to the approval of theAnnual General Meeting of the Shareholders of the Suez Canal&apos; Company.2. The Company embarked on the negotiations because they feared that,if they did not settle outstanding matters of dispute between themselves and theEgyptian Government, the latter would carry out their threat to apply theEgyptian Companies&apos; Law of 1947, by virtue of which Egyptian representation on the Board of the Company would be increased to 40 per cent, of the totalnumber of directors.3. The negotiations covered a wide range of subjects, but from the pointof view of His Majesty&apos;s Government three only were of importance. these were: (a) The Egyptian Governments claim for preferential treatment forEgyptian shipping or goods passing through the Canal.(6) Egyptian representation on the Board of the Company,(c) The Egyptian Governments share in the profits of the Company.4. The first two questions were of particular importance in that they hada bearing on the future of the Canal when the Concession comes to an end in1968. To admit any Egyptian claim to preferential treatment on the Canalwould have been contrary to the principle of equal rights for all nations, implicit in the Suez Canal Convention of 1888. It is important that this principle shouldbe preserved after the Concession comes to an end, irrespective of whatever other arrangements are made for the administration of the Canal and the passage ofshipping through it. The Egyptian Governments claim, therefore, was strongly resisted by the British Government Directors on the Board and the former finally agreed to drop it It is possible that they may seek to revive it in some formwhen the Montreux Convention safeguarding foreign rights in Egypt lapses inOctober this year, but for the time being the principle of equality of treatment for all shipping passing through the Canal is being preserved.5. On the question of Egyptian representation on the Canal Company&apos;sBoard, the British Government Directors took the view that for the canal company to have accepted the Egyptian claim to twelve seats out of the thirty-twoon the Board would have been tantamount to accepting the application of theEgyptian Companies&apos; Law to the Suez Canal Company and would, furthermore,have strengthened the Egyptian position on the Board to an extent which mighthave enabled the Egyptian Government in 1968 to insist that the future of the canal after that date should be a matter which concerned the Egyptian Govern-ment alone. The Egyptian Government pressed the question of the directorships36715
at the last moment, but finally accepted a compromise giving them three more seatsbetween 1949 and 1954. and two further seats^ between 1954 and 1968, making atotal of eight by 1968,&quot;when tne- Concession&apos;ends! - &quot;u,^&apos;r^6. On the third question, that of the Egyptian Government&apos;s share in theCompany&apos;s profits, His Majesty&apos;s Government took the view that, provided their interests as the largest shareholder were looked after; this was; substantially amatter for the Company to decide. The arrangement by which the egyptian government is to receive 7 per cent, of the gross annual profits of the Companywill yield the Egyptian Government about  E.800,000 per, annum and is acceptable to the Treasury. vwrn.  a jwv. v,!;7. The agreement which has now been reached represents a considerable increase in Egyptian interest in the affairs of the Company, but this has neitherbeen at the expense of British shipping interests nor to the prejudice of theinternational character of the Canal. The negotiations have also provided anopportunity for the British Government Directors to increase their influence,which formerly counted for little in the Committee of Management. For thisHis Majesty&apos;s Government have good reason to be grateful to Sir Francis Wylie,who has acquired a remarkable mastery of the Canal Company&apos;s business in the short time he has been a British Government Director and has shown great skillin dealing with the French officials and Directors of the Company and latterlywith the Egyptian Government.v-:- m\ - - -   E.
