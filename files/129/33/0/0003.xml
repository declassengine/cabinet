IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)SECRETQ. P. (49; 43 COPY NO. 3]1ST MARCHvi949- &apos;CABINET   -9GRANT OP INCREASED MARRIAGE allowances to NATIONAL SERVICE OFFICERSMemorandum by the Minister of defence on 22nd November, 1948, I reported to the Cabinet.(CM. (48) 75th Conclusions, Minute 4) an agreement reached with the Chancellor of the-Exchequer for increases in both pay and marriage allowances for regular other ranks in the forces and increases in officers&apos; marriage allowances of 11s. Od aweek for officers under the age of 25 (who receive the highest&apos;other rank&apos; rate) and of 3s. Od a day (for those whosefamilies are in quarters) or 6s. Od a day for other officersover the age of 25.     With the approval of the Cabinet Iannounced the improved rates to the House of 24th November -the text of the statement is attached to this memorandum.^2. When these increases were discussed, prior to this statement, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer he pressed strongly that, they should not extend to national service men,and to this the Service Ministers and I reluctantly agreed.The position of national service officers, however, was not specifically raised in the discussions and is not explicitlycovered by my statement.     When, however, the wording of that statement was under discussion a day or two before it was madethe Treasury, at the official level, reserved their position on this point which was left open for subsequent settlement onits merits.3* My Service colleagues and I were, however, under theimpression that the Chancellor had meant by &apos;-national servicemen&apos; only other ranks and after further consideration we thoughtit right that the words should be so interpreted. &apos;   TheChancellor does not accept this interpretation.4. The Statement in the House.Although no specific reference was made in my state-ment to the position of national service officers its form, inmy&apos;view, does make it most difficult to refuse them the increases given to other officers.     The statement deals first with the increases of pay and allowances for other ranks, thenmakes the reservation that national service men should not receive increases and finally deals with officers;    in this form it does, I suggest, at least imply that all officers would get the increases.      It may be that the form of the state-ment does not strictly preclude us from withholding the increases from national service officers, but there is nodoubt that if we did so we should be accused of bad faith andI am most reluctant to add to the present volume of criticismin the Press and in Parliament of the -Forces&apos; pay scales.

5. The types of National Service officer concerned.About 5,000 officers are concerned.     About half aremen called up under the National Service Acts as officers(doctors, dentists, etc.)    and the remainder are those called up as other ranks and s\ibsequently commissioned.     The pro-fessional men are, of course, older than the general run ofnational service men and a larger proportion of them aremarried.      They will, in many cases, be over 25 and the increases involved in such cases are normally  2.2s. Od a week,a sum of great importance individually.In the case of doctors I am particularly apprehen-sive.     The British Medical Association have always complainedbitterly that medical officers under 25 do not get the full rate of marriage allowance, and they will almost certainlyobject strongly and vocally if any doctors in the Services donot get- the recent increases.6.      .       The reaction on other ranks.The Chancellor feels that, if the increases were granted to national service officers, pressure to extend them also to national service other ranks would arise and would be  -difficult to -resist.      The fact that the majority of marriedofficers.concerned are professional men, called up for national service directly as officers, and much older thanthe general run of other rank, national service men IsVanimportant argument in favour of granting the national service officers the increases given to their regular colleagues.&apos;]7. National Service Grants.The Chancellor has expressed the view that, wherethere is domestic hardship as a result of an officer retaining the old rates of marriage allowance, it can be met by thesystem of national service grants referred to in the attachedstatement.      These grants have been continued for national- service other ranks who have not received the recent increases;but in the case of officers they are of little practical importance, and we should be glad, in principle, to makenational service officers ineligible for them if they were allowed to receive the recent increases in marriage allowance.There might, if this were done, have to be some system ofreserving the rights of national service other ranks in receiptof national service grants to prevent a possible reduction inemoluments on commissioning.8. Cost.As stated above, there is a total.of only about 5,000national service officers at present.      It is a question of 2. 2s.0d&quot;a week for married officers over ,25 not provided withquarters ( l.1s.0d a week in those cases where quarters are provided) and of 11s. Od a week for married officers under 25.It is impossible to say accurately how many officers there willbe in each category and I cannot, therefore, give an accurate estimate of cost but it may be of the order of  50,000 a year.This is very small in relation to the estimate of  12,000,000for 19^-9/50 of the total cost of the recent increases.

g. Summary.iTo, sum up:    I ask the Cabinet to agree that nationalservice officers should be given the recent increases inofficers&apos; marriage allowances on the grounds that:-(a) this is clearly implied by the terms.of myI recent statement in the House;(b) &quot;the majority of the married officers concerned are professional men, commissioned direct from civil life, of whom many are over theage. of 25;(c,)&quot; there should be little difficulty in&apos;justifyingthe distinction between officers and other ranks;(d)    the cost is small.A. V. A.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.1ST MARCH, 1949.

APPENDIX     ,&apos;A&apos;STATEMENT (214-TH NOVEMBER&apos; 19U8.  HANSARD,   COL.  1250)ARMED FORCES (PAY AND ALLOWANCES)At the end of Questions -&apos;   MR. ALEXANDER:    The Government have carefulyreviewed the financial position of officers and other ranks in the Armed Forces.    As the House knows,  the scales of pay and allowances of ratings and. other rankswere designed to secure broad equality between Serviceemoluments and rates of wages for comparable civilianemployment.    Industrial wages have risen since I9I4.6,and the Service man has,  to some extent,   shared inthese increases by reason of the increased value to him of the food,  clothing and. accommodation which he receives in kind.    Nevertheless there is evidence of hardship experienced on present emoluments,  in parti-cular by married men.    It has therefore been decided togrant to other ranks increases in both pay and marriage allowance.    I am circulating full details in the official report,  and. in the circumstances it is not proposed to publish a further White Paper.I will deal first with marriage allowance.    Thepresent rates for other ranks range from 35s.  &quot;to 1+5S. aweek.    In the case of men serving on voluntary regularengagements the revisecJ range will be from 14.2s.  to 56s.a week,  an increase of from 7s.  to 11s.As regards pay there will be no increase forrecruits during their- first -six months&apos;  service, norfor the private soldier or his equivalent without anyspecial trade or other Service qualifications.    For men with higher qualifications or higher rank however therewill be increases in basic pay ranging from 3s. 6d.  aweek to as much as 10s. 6d.  a week.    These arrangements should encourage the recruitment of men with specialskill,  and provide general incentive to acquire higherqualifications.    In all,  therefore,  the increases for married men will range from /s. up to 21s.  6d.  a week.The new rates of marriage allowance will notapply to National Service men.    They will hov/ever be eligible to have their Service emoluments supplemented by a system of National Service C-rants,   similar to theWar Service Grants which were introduced, for the same purpose,  during the War.    Details are now being worked out.    The increases in pay will apply to National Servicemen after their first year of service.    Until they have completed this period of service no improvement in theexisting rates of pay is,  in our view necessary.As regards officers,   the present rates of paytake account of the special expenses involved in Servicelife, we have however decided that in present circum-stances some further assistance is necessary for marriedofficers.    These officers,  owing to the present abnormalfrequency of postings In the Services coupled with thegeneral housing shortage are exposed to numerousexceptional expenses including,  if they are not accom-accommodated in official quarters, very high rents.    The

rates of officers&apos; marriage allowance will therefore - beincreased by 6s.  a day if they are not accommodated inmarried quarters,  and by 3s.  a day if they are soaccommodated,  or receive special local overseasallowances designed to .protect them against high rents.These provisions are related to conditions which may prove in whole or in part to be temporary and they will&quot;be subject to review should these conditions materiallyimprove.    After full consideration we do not feel that,in present circumstances,  increases in the basic pay ofofficers are justified.The -improvements which I have announced,  and.which I feel sure will be welcomed by all Members ofthe House, will take effect from, today,  and. my Servicecolleagues will do their best to ensure that they are put into payment&apos; as quickly as the necessary admini-strative arrangements can be made.EXTRACT FROM DETAILS CIRCULATED IN OFFICIAL REPORTIII.    MARRIAGE ALLOWANCES (OFFICERS)Married officers aged. 25 and over will receive(over the present rates of marriage allowance set out in para. 37 of Cmd. 6750) increases of 6s.  a day if theyare not accommodated in married quarters and 3s.  a dayif they are so accommodated.    Certain officers servingoverseas who receive special local allowances which are designed,  among other things, to compensate them for thehigh rents of private accommodation will be treated forthis purpose as if they were accommodated, in officialquarters and will receive the lower rate of.increase inmarriage allowance.    Married officers under the age of25 will,  as at present,  receive the highest &quot;other rank&quot;rate of marriage allowance which, as explained above,  isto be increased from 1+5s.  to 56s.  a week.-2.
