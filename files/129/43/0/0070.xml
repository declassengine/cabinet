15TH DECEMBER, 1950CABINETMIGRATION POLICYASSISTED PASSAGE AGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIAMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and national service in CP.(50) 306 the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations proposes that the Assisted Passage Scheme to Australiashould be allowed to lapse when the present agreement comes to an endon 30th March, 1951.     This is an important proposal carrying veryserious implications and I feel that it is one which should not be decidedhurriedly nor without careful examination of all the considerations involved.2. I hope that my colleagues will study carefully the arguments forand against continuing a contribution from United kingdom funds towardsmigration to Commonwealth countries, which are contained in Annex Bto C.F.(50) 306.     In my view the balance of argument is overwhelminglyII in favour of a continuation of this policy.     I conclude that the properdecision to take at this time is that mentioned in paragraph 4 of theSecretary of State&apos;s memorandum, namely, to continue the assisted passage Agreement for approximately another year until the empire settlement Acts are due to expire in May, 1952.     This will permit us toconsider our future migration policy as a whole.     Below I recapitulatebriefly some considerations in favour of this course.3. On all grounds - social, economic, political and defence - it isdesirable to maintain so far as possible the present preponderance ofBritish stock in Australia.     This consideration seems to me paramount,beside which all others are relatively insignificant.     The fact-that theBritish element in Canada tends to become more diluted makes it more,not less, important to maintain the British preponderance in thoseCommonwealth countries where it may still be practicable.     This, andthe fact that Australia&apos;s need for migrants is so much greater than thatof other Dominions, is the justification for giving assistance to Australia,which was available to other. Dominions but of which, for reasons of theirown, they did not wish to take advantage.4. The man-power loss to this country can be greatly exaggerates.The Australian Government aims at attracting 100,000 persons a year from this country including dependants.        The loss of this number tothis country with its 23^ million working population is not comparable9 to the gain to Australia with a working population of 3 million.fTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(50) 320 COPY NO. ^2

5. Moreover, the effective loss to our economy depends upon the type of worker who emigrates.     So long as we are making a contribution towards the cost of passages, the co-operation necessary in the controlof a joint scheme automatically enables us to exercise influence over the type of persons whom Australia selects.     It would be most unfortunate if the Australians were to concentrate on trying to attract workers in&quot;scarcity&quot; categories or on single workers rather than family groupsas we have tried to secure in the past.     It will certainly be far lesseasy to exercise effective influence if we stop our contribution, as itcould only be done by making special representations, normally afterthings were seen to be going wrong and on the basis of inadequate infor -mation as to what, was happening which we would not be obtaining, as weare now, at first hand.     How much good-will there might be on theAustralian side in listening to such representations in the new circum-stances is debatable, but for the reasons given, our control over thesituation would certainly be seriously weakened unless we are preparedto introduce drastic restrictions which would be unacceptable to the would-be   British emigrant and might well cause serious friction withthe Australian Government.6. It should be noted that under the New Zealand scheme, to whichwe do not contribute, their authorities have been allowed a free hand in seeking recruits, i.e. we have not operated any checks as to areas andcategories or advertising campaigns.     The numbers involved have been small, but if anything of the same sort happened with Australia, whosedemands are so very much larger and increasing, serious results might follow in the loss of workers in categories in which there is a shortage.7. There can beqittle doubt that a decision to stop our contribution would be widely misunderstood in Australia.     It is a matter on whichthey are extremely sensitive and such a decision would not only causepresent ill-will but if at some future time we- should again wish to give more active encouragement to emigration from this country we mightwell find Australia unwilling to co-operate.8. The argument in paragraph &quot;   of C.P.(50) 306 that it is only right to give financial help to would-be emigrants in days of massunemployment seems to me to be misconceived and if advanced as suggested as an argument in favour of the proposed policy would almost certainly be regarded as a public, admission that the Government hadbeen pursuing a mistaken policy in this matter since the war.     Moreover,it contains implications which are far from accurate,     It is true that theexistence of severe unemployment was a factor in the Empire settlementpolicy of the inter-war years, but it was only one element, and to suggestthat it was the whole story would both be wrong and would certainlycause resentment in Australia.    Again, to talk about &quot;paying people toemigrate&quot; is not only inaccurate but is unnecessarily offensive both tothe Commonwealth countries and to the migrants.     Surely the correctdescription of the policy is that in a situation where it was to the advantagiboth of the Commonwealth and of the migrants that the latter should seekemployment in Commonwealth countries, the British Government wereprepared to assist the would-be migrant by contributing to the cost ofhis fare.     I must press, therefore, that whatever the decision of mycolleagues on the Secretary of 5tate&apos;s proposal, the argument in thesecond part of paragraph 7 should in no circumstances be used.

9. The question really boils down to this - is it worth while tomake this drastic change in overseas settlement policy with all theserious disadvantages and possible repercussions involved for the sake of saving a relatively small sum?     While I accept the necessitynot to spend money on anything that is not essential, we must haveregard to the effect of any economy measures we take and I believethat the proposed economy at the expense of Australian migrationhas such disadvantages that we should be ill-advised to adopt thiscourse.10. Finally, I would urge my colleagues to defer a decision until after the discussions with Mr.  Menzies.     It would, I feel,.be bothunwise and discourteous to present him with a decision already takenor even to let him feel that it has been taken.G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S.W.1,15TH DECEMBER, 1950.
