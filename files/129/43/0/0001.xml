THIS   DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT       &quot;Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1950SECRET Copy No. 32CP. (50) 2513\st October, 1950CABINETPAKISTAN: POSITION OF THE HEAD OF THE STATE UNDER THEPROPOSALS FOR A NEW constitution memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations am sorry to have to draw the attention of my colleagues to disturbing develop-ments in Pakistan in connexion with the drafting of the new Constitution.2. The Basic Principles Committee of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistanhas recently submitted an Interim Report. As the Report is rather long I am notcirculating a copy, but I annex a note analysing those parts of it which deal withthe position of the Head of the State. I think it will be agreed that, if a constitution is adopted by the Assembly which contains anything like the provisions recom-mended, there would not only be no place for a Governor-General in Pakistan,but the Head of the State would possess most, if not all, of those powers now exercised by The King. Thus, though the Report makes no reference to a Republic,it would, if adopted, produce a state of affairs in which the future position ofThe King in relation to Pakistan would not differ greatly from his present positionin relation to India, i.e., His Majesty might be recognised as Head of the Common-wealth but he would play no part in the Constitution of Pakistan.3. It will be seen from the note that the Report is not to be considered bythe present session of the Constituent Assembly. A special session for the purposemay be held in November or December, and the delay is intended to give membersan opportunity of studying the Report. The United Kingdom High commissioner at Karachi has been asked meanwhile to report fully on the background to itsproduction, the extent to which it can be assumed to represent theviews of the Pakistan Government, and any indications which he maybe able to obtain of the intentions of that Government towards those sections of the Report dealing with the position of the Head of the State. The formof any representations to the Pakistan Government can be considered in the lightof his comments and I do not ask my colleagues to reach any decisions at present.I think it important, however, that they should be aware at once of a situation whichis serious both in itself and in the encouragement which it may give to Republicantendencies in South Africa.P. C. G-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,31st October, 1950.ANNEXInterim Report of Basic Principles Committee of Constituent Assemblyof PakistanAnalysis of Provisions dealing with the Head of the state the Basic Principles Committee of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, whichwas appointed by the Assembly on 12th March, 1949, to report on the main39573
principles on which the Constitution of Pakistan is to be framed, submitted an interim Report to the Prime Minister on 28th September last. The Committeemembers included the Prime Minister of Pakistan himself, together with theprincipal Pakistan Cabinet Ministers, as well as the Governors of the Punjab and east Bengal. Its Report is in the form of a section of a draft constitution forPakistan and the following are the more important clauses dealing with the &quot; Headof the State &quot;: -Clause 7 provides that the Executive power shall vest in the Head ofthe State, to be exercised by him in accordance with the Constitution and onthe advice of the Ministry.Clause 8-The Head of the State shall be elected in joint session by bothHouses of Parliament.Clause 9.

All treaties are to be signed and ratified by the Head of theState.Clause 117. The Head of the State &quot;should have powers to receivediplomats.&quot;Clause 118. The Head of the State has the power to declare war.There are other clauses which refer to the Head of State in connection with his duties relating to the Executive, Legislature or Judiciary.2. There is no reference whatever to the Crown and the provisions relatingto the Head of the State would appear to indicate that The King is to play no partin the Constitution of Pakistan. Indeed, the summary above indicates that it is expressly provided that the Head of the State is the fountain of honour in so far
as awards and decorations are permitted and is responsible for declaring war,signing and ratifying treaties, receiving diplomats, and appointing cabinet ministers and the commanding officers of the defence services. His duties are socomprehensive that no place is left for The King within the State. In a press conference the Governor of the Punjab is reported to have discussed the positionof the Head of State as recommended in the P^eport of the Basic Principles Com-mittee and to have drawn special attention to the distinction between the position which the Head of the State would enjoy and that of a monarch. It is significantof the general attitude in Pakistan towards the Crown that the Governor was apparently not asked any questions as to the future position of The King in relationto the new Constitution.3. The Basic Principles Committee, in submitting its report, stated that it hadbeen unable to finalise its recommendations on some other matters, including the&quot; qualifications of the Head of the State,&quot; but there is no indication that the recom-mendations made in the report were not unanimous. The Prime Minister himselfsubmitted the report to the Constituent Assembly. It can therefore be assumed that the report, on the subjects which it covers, expresses the views of the PrimeMinister, the majority of the Cabinet, and a sufficient number of the members ofthe Assembly to make it probable that it will be adopted without much change inprinciple unless the Prime Minister and the Cabinet should later dissociate them-selves from some of the Committee&apos;s recommendations and propose amendments.At first sight it might appear that there was some likelihood of this in that thePrime Minister, in submitting the Report to the Assembly, proposed that considera-tion of it should not take place in the course of the Assembly&apos;s present session inorder to give members time to study it. But it would appear that the President,who was a member of the Committee, did not expect any amendments other thanPrivate Members&apos; amendments in that he ruled that notice of amendments might begiven in until &quot; Monday next &quot; (i.e., 1st October).4. It is, therefore, only possible, on present information, to regard the report as indicating the intention of the Pakistan Constituent Assembly and Cabinet toproceed towards the adoption of a Constitution indistinguishable from that of are public. It will be remembered that there were indications of such a line of thought at the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in April 1949. At thefirst meeting Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan referred to the possibility that if India couldbecome a Republic and remain in the Commonwealth other countries might alsowish to do so, and, at his suggestion, it was finally agreed at the fourth meeting&quot; that it should be put on record as the opinion of the meeting that, while it wasnot possible to bind future meetings or Governments, it could be logically assumed that a future meeting would accord the same treatment to any other member as hadbeen accorded to India.&quot; The Pakistan Government have, in the last eighteen months, taken a number of steps which, in retrospect, can be seen to have been in line with the recommendations in the Report, viz.:  (1) The so-called Objectives Resolution adopted by the Constituent assembly on 12th March (which Clause 1 of the Report of the Basic PrinciplesCommittee proposes should be incorporated in the Constitution as a directive principle of policy) states that &quot; Sovereignty over the entire Universe belongs to GodAlmighty alone,&quot; and refers to the delegation of His authority &quot; tothe State of Pakistan through its people.&quot;(2) Pakistan concluded a treaty with Iraq towards the end of last year in whatis called &quot; Heads of States &quot; form, but in which reference to The king was replaced by reference to the Governor-General. The permanent secretary for Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations in pakistan explained recently that this had been done in his absence andenquired whether the irregularity could be corrected by an amendmentof the Governor-GeneraFs commission on the lines of that given to theGovernor-General of Canada which would empower the latter to ratifya treaty on behalf of Canada.(3) The Pakistan authorities are taking steps to remove from the Governmentof India Act, 1935, which is still operative in respect of Pakistan,reference to the Governor-GeneraFs assent to Bills requiring to be given&quot; in the name of His Majesty.&quot;   They enquired whether there would
be any constitutional objection to this and were informed that Common-wealth practice was not uniform and that in some commonwealth countries (e.g,, Australia and New Zealand) this phrase was not used.(4) The Pakistan authorities have objected to the proposed credentials of theHigh Commissioner for India in Pakistan being addressed by thePresident of India to The King and have expressed the view that they ought to be addressed to the Governor-General of Pakistan since other-wise Pakistan would be placed in an inferior position Lo India. Thedifficulties which such a course would involve were explained to thePermanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations,who recognised them and was hopeful of convincing the Prime Minister.The Pakistan Government subsequently enquired the views of Com-commonwealth Governments other than the United Kingdom and Indiaand it is believed that these Governments endorsed the reasons whichhad led to the adoption of the new procedure as between the UnitedKingdom and India.(5) On the occasion of the inauguration in September of a new President of el Salvador a message was sent to the President from the Governor-General.(6) There have been press reports that it is the intention of the pakistan government to amend the Governor-GeneraFs Oath so as to remove any reference to allegiance to The King.All these points are covered by the recommendations of the Report and the Headof State is given express power to perform the actions in question. It is difficult,therefore, to avoid the conclusion that the Basic Principles Report is in conformitywith a line of thought as regards the office of the Governor-General which is entirely contrary to the continuance of that office as such or to the maintenance ofHis Majesty&apos;s position as King of Pakistan.5. It is, indeed,, true that the Report nowhere uses the word Republic and itmay be that the Pakistan Government are still contemplating some position inbetween their present position as a Member of the Commonwealth owing similarallegiance to the Crown to that owed in the United Kingdom and the olderDominions and the position of India as a Republic within the Commonwealth owingno allegiance to the Crown. Such constitutional hair-splitting may presentattractions to the Pakistan Government as a means of overcoming what they must recognise to be the reluctance of the United Kingdom and probably other Common-wealth Governments to accept a Republic in fact if not in name. With this objectthey might be presented as an indication of the Pakistan Government^ genuinedesire to retain a relationship with the rest of the Commonwealth somewhat closerthan that of India but which would none the less secure to Pakistan all the symbolsof independence on which, it will be argued, public opinion in Pakistan is insistent.6. In these circumstances it would seem to be most desirable that the Pakistanauthorities should not be left under any delusion as to the view which would betaken in this country of such subterfuges. If Pakistan wishes to become a Republicthere is nothing to prevent her so doing, and, in view of the precedent which hasbeen set as regards India, there is no reason to suppose that the other Members ofthe Commonwealth would not be prepared to accept Pakistan as an equal member.It would be necessary, however, for a Commonwealth conference to be held forthe purpose, and Pakistan would have placed the Indian Government in the curiousposition of being able to oppose her application for continued membership of theCommonwealth if they wished to do so. The High Commissioner at Karachi hasbeen asked to report fully on the circumstances in which the Report was producedand on any indications which he may be able to obtain of the attitude of membersof the Pakistan Government, and particularly of Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan, towards it.The form of any representations to the Pakistan Government can be considered inthe light of this information.
