\. 30?[(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 3263OTH DECEMBER, 19501?COPY NO.0^cabinet future OF THE EAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUT scheme memorandum by the Minister of FoodThere are two specific points which my colleagues will wish toconsider with the paper by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the future of theEast African Groundnut Scheme (C, P. (50) 324)..   The first is the text of theWhite Paper which is to be issued announcing our decision on the scheme,,and the second is the future responsibility for the Queensland-British food corporation.2. A preliminary draft of a White Paper was attached as Annex III tothe paper (C. P. (50) 289) which the Secretary of State for the Colonies and I circulated on 3.0th November.   He and I have re-examined this draft in thelight of the Chancellor&apos;s recommendations and we have made the amendments which are necessary on the assumption that the Chancellor&apos;s recommendations are adopted.    The revised draft is attached as an appendix.   Apart from a fewminor alterations the only amendment of substance is in paragraph 13.The original text provided for a decision next year&apos; of clearing policy for1951/52 and the two subsequent years.    The revised text makes it clear thata decision on future clearing, over and above the 40,000 acresbeing felled during the present wet season, will not be taken until 1954.3. If my colleagues approve the text of the White Paper I propose toarrange for its publication at the earliest possible date.   The Chairman ofthe Overseas Food Corporation is very concerned about the effect on the morale of the staff in East Africa of any further delay in announcing thedecision about the future plan of operations.4. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and I were invited to hold preliminary discussions with the Prime xvlinister of Queenslandregarding the future administration of the Queensland-British food corporation   (C. M. (50) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 4(2)).    we discussed theproblem with Mr. Hanlon, the Prime Minister of Queensland ,on 18th December.He assured us that there was no possibility of the Government of Queenslandincreasing their financial interest in the scheme.   Apart from the fact thattheir financial resources were fully committed, he explained the political reasons against such a course.   He said that the Opposition in Queensland hadbeen trying to prove that the scheme was a failure and that in default of any evidence to this end they had recently been driven to assert that the UnitedKingdom Government had little confidence in the future of the scheme andthat they would shortly try to abandon it.    In view of his attitude I fear thatthere is no chance that we shall be able to prevail upon the QueenslandGovernment to assume full responsibility for the scheme.5. I have therefore considered what arrangements might be made forthe future direction of the scheme.   I am a little reluctant that my department should continue to.exercise responsibility for a scheme which in isolation and

divorced from the larger venture of the Overseas Food Corporation can nevermake a significant contribution to the solution of our long-term food problems.But after considering the possible alternative courses I am compelled to&apos;recognise that even more weighty objections may be brought against them.I therefore propose to make appropriate arrangements, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, for my Department to 3.SS 11 m   direct responsibility for the affairs of the Queensland-British Food Corporation.recommendations. I therefore recommend to my colleagues that:-(i)   if the proposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. (50) 324 are approved a Vvhite Paper in the terms of the attached draft should bepublished as soon as possible;(ii)   the Ministry of Food should assume direct responsibility for theactivities of the Queensland-British Food Corporation.M. W.Ministry of Food, S. W. 1. ,30TH DECEMBER, 1950.

The Overseas Food Corporation have submitted a revised plan forthe future work of the East African Groundnut Scheme to the Minister of Food.This plan (which is set out in the Appendix to this paper51 ) has beenconsidered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    The original aims of the schemehave proved incapable of fulfilment.    That is not to say, however, that thescheme and the work which has been done on it are now valueless and should be abandoned:   on the contrary His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that it is stillof importance, although a new conception of its objectives is necessary.    Itwill be continued as an experimental development project under the directionof the Secretary of State for the Colonies and revised arrangements v/ill bemade for financing it.Original Plan for the Production of Groundnuts2. The plan approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the production ofgroundnuts in East Africa was based on the recommendations of a Mission whichvisited Tanganyika and other African territories in 1946.   The Mission&apos;s report and the Governments decision to embark upon a scheme based on therecommendations contained in their report were published in February, 1947(Cmd. 7030).3. Work in East Africa began under the direction of the United AfricaCompany Etd. , acting as Managing Agents for the Minister of Food, on whomresponsibility was placed for carrying out the scheme.   In accordance with the published intention of the Government responsibility for the direction of thescheme was subsequently transferred to a public Corporation.   The overseas food Corporation, established under the Overseas Resources Development Act,1948, became responsible for the East African Groundnut   Scheme onthe 1st March, 1946, and a month later assumed control of the day-to-day management of work in Tanganyika.4. The plan on which work began envisaged the clearing by 1953 of3,210,000 acres of bush in East and Central Africa and an annual productionof groundnuts after that date of about 600,000 tons.    The total capitalexpenditure involved, was estimated at approximately  24,000,000.   The schemewas recognised to be a pioneering venture in large-scale mechanisedagriculture under tropical conditions without precedent and open to great risks.But the advice of many responsible people consulted at the time gaveHis Majesty&apos;s Government grounds for believing that a programme of mechanisedland clearing and agricultural operations on the lines suggested by the Missionstood a reasonable chance of success.    It was intended that the plan should besubject to continuous review in the light of fresh information gathered as thework progressed, and, where necessary, re-cast or modified.5. A progress report published in January, 1948 (Cmd.  7314) explainedthat the first year&apos;s work had fallen behind schedule.    But some of the majordifficulties which have since been experienced by the Overseas Food corporation had not at that stage been encountered and it was still thought that the clearingand cultivation of land on the broad lines and within the time schedule set out in cmd.  7 33 0 could be accomplished.Modification of the Plan6. Further and more formidable difficulties both in clearing bush and inmechanised cultivation of the cleared land led to a revision of the original plan to clear 3,210,000 acres.    Not only aid the annual clearing and plantingx   See CP. (50) 2b9, Annex I.-1-DRAFT &quot;WHITE PAPER ON THE FUTURE OF the overseas FOOD CORPORATION

programme suggested in Cmd.  7030 prove to be beyond the Corporation&apos;^physical capabilities, but the cost of land clearing was found to be very muchgreater.than had been estimated.   In the light of the knowledge and experience   -which they had gained up to that time, the Overseas Food Cor pore .   a sub-mitted. to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the autumn of 1949 a revised pro-gramme of development which they considered could be carried out withinthe resources available to them.   This programme, which envisaged the clearing of 600,000 acres of bush by 1954, was accepted by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and announced in Parliament by the Minister of Food on the26th November, 1949&apos;.The Overseas Food Corporation^ proposals. Experience of another year of bush clearing and another harvestseason has led the Overseas Food Corporation to revise and modify stillfurther their development programme.    They now regard the clearing of600,000 acres of bush by 1954 as impracticable.    They have accordinglysubmitted to the Minister of Food a revised plan of development.8. The Corporation&apos;3 new proposals cover a seven-year period up to1957.    They envisage no further land clearing at Kongwa or Urambo afterthe end of 1950.    The proposals for Kongwa, which are based on the Report ofthe Kongwa Working Party, have already been announced.   Of the cleared areaof 90,000 acres, about 24,000 acres are to be set aside for agriculture, of which12,000 acres will be under crop each year.    The remainder of the clearedland will be available for grazing.    The object is to conduct fully costed fieldscale trials on a limited acreage for a period of three years.   A further review will then be made, in the light of the results achieved, of the possi-bility of again extending arable agriculture over some or all of the remainder of the cleared land.9. Clearing will finish at Urambo by the end of 1950.   Although bush hasbeen felled on 65,000 acres, it is not expected that more than 45,000 acres willbe available for agriculture for the harvest of 1951.    60,000 acres will befarmed in subsequent years.10. In the Southern Province some 20,00.0 acres have been felled, ofwhich 7,000 acres will be available for agriculture for the 1951 harvest.During the current wet season a further 40,000 acres are being felled with thetwo land clearing teams built up for that purpose.    Thereafter the Corporationpropose drastically to reduce the tractor force to the minimum required tocomplete the remaining operations on this 40,000 acres and to adopt as lower and cheaper method of land clearing involving the substitution of handlabour for part of the work at present done by machines,    Under this scheme the-same tractor force might be expected to be able to fell an additional 15,000acres of land per year and the Corporation expect to bring the same acreageinto cultivation each year.    By 1957 they estimate that they may thus have105,000 acres fully cleared for agriculture and a further 45,000 acres invarious stages of preparation.11. An important feature of the revised scheme is that instead of farmingunits of 30,000 acres as originally proposed, all three areas will, with one exception at. Kongwa, be farmed in units varying from 1,500 to 6,000acres under intensive supervision by men who can gain an intimate knowledgeof the land which they farm.12. In submitting their proposals the Corporation have emphasised the need for continuity of agricultural operations over a period of at least seven years in the interests both of efficiency and of the morale of the staff, which has suffered from past uncertainties and changes of plan.

13. The proposals have been considered by His Majesty1 s Government,who regard the reasons given by the Corporation for the. modification of theexisting scheme as conclusive.   They recognise that during the initialexperimental period trading losses are bound to be made.   Nevertheless,subject to what follows, His Majesty1 s Government have accepted the revisedplan.   They are convinced that the Corporation are right in seeking some assurance of continuity of agricultural production and provided that the cumulative losses do not become excessive, it is their firm intention that funds should be provided to enable farming operations to continue for seven years -the minimum period within which to establish a cropping policy and agri-cultural techniques and to test the economics of farming.   Development workin the Southern Province will proceed up to 1954 on the clearing of the40,000 acres being felled during the present wet season.    This will bring thetotal cleared area in that region to 60,000 acres, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment consider that it would be prudent to limit development to thatacreage for the time being.   The Corporation have themselves proposed thatthere should be a review in 1954   in the light of agricultural and&apos;land clearingexperience to determine what further felling and clearing should take place after that date.   His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that this is a wiseproposal and that it would be unrealistic to accept any commitment at thisstage for the further development of the Southern Province beyond the3 0th September, 1954.   A decision will be made in the light of the 1954 reviewwhether and if so on what scale further felling and clearing should be under-taken after that date,   A tractor force will in any case be maintained to carryout the clearing operations on the 40,000 acres of land which is to be felled,this season, and further felling could be resumed in 1954.Nature of the Scheme.14. The acceptance of the revised programme submitted by the overseas food Corporation involves a radical change in the whole conception of thescheme.    The original aim was to increase production of oils and fats to meet a world shortage which was and still is expected to persist.   It was hoped that within a comparatively short time the scheme would make a substantial contribution to world supplies.    This hope has not been fulfilled and, whilethe possibility remains that in time Tanganyika may contribute to world oils andfat supplies, the Corporation&apos;s proposals show that too much has yet to belearned about methods of land clearing and large-scale mechanised agriculture in Tanganyika to give any grounds for supposing that rapid development overwide areas is at present practicable.15. The scheme must now be regarded as a scheme of large-scaleexperimental development to establish the economics of clearing andmechanised or partially mechanised-agriculture under tropical conditions.His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered whether on this new basis the continuance of the scheme is justified;   they are in no doubt that it is.-  Oneof the main purposes of the original scheme was to increase the productivity of Tanganyika and raise the standard of living of its people.   Even on the modified basis now proposed the scheme cannot fail to be an important contri&quot;bution to the economic prosperity of the territory.    It would not be. justifiable to allow the considerable acreages of hitherto unusable land which theCorporation have already made available for agriculture and pasture to revert to bush.    In the long run enough food to meet the world1 s needs with expandingpopulations and rising standards of living can only be produced by bringing intocultivation, by more efficient methods of agriculture, land which has hitherto been uneconomical to develop.   His Majesty1 s Government have undertakenas members of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations to share in efforts designed to increase world food supplies and they are

convinced that it is incumbent on them to continue the experiment which hasbeen started with a view to determining whether hitherto unproductive bush   -can be economically developed for productive purposes.   The abandonment ofthe present scheme to which so much money and effort have been devoted,at a time when techniques are beginning to develop which may in due courseprove fruitful, would be a retrograde step which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould not be prepared to take.16. The change in the nature of the scheme has caused His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to reconsider the arrangements whereby the Minister of Foodis charged with responsibility for its supervision.   This arrangement was appropriate when the aim was the large-scale production of oilseeds on acommercial basis.   But now that it has become primarily a colonial development project to determine the economics of clearing and mechanisedagriculture in Tanganyika it is proper for the responsibility to pass to theSecretary of State for the Colonies.    Legislation to amend the OverseasResources Development Act will be introduced to enable this change to be made during 1951.   In the meanwhile, until the formalities of transfer have beencompleted, there will be the same close consultation with the Secretary ofState for the Colonies on all questions of policy affecting the Corporation as there has been in the past.   In order to ensure that the Tanganyika Governmentshould also be fully associated with the operation of the scheme, arrangements are being made for that Government to be represented on the Board of theCorporation.Queensland-British Food Corporation17. It is not considered appropriate for the Overseas Food Corporation toretain, after responsibility passes to the Secretary of State for the Colonies ,partial control of the Queensland-British Food Corporation, which is at present their subsidiary company.    When the time comes for Parliament to considerthe transfer of responsibility for the Overseas Food Corporation to the-Secretary of State for tne Colonies, His Majesty&apos;s Government will proposealternative arrangements for the control of the Queensland-British food corporation.The Port of Mtwara18. When the East African groundnut    scheme was first considered it was recognised that the most promising area for development was situated in the Southern Province.    But since the site chosen was nearly a hundredmiles from the sea it was not possible for bush clearing to begin untilcommunications had been established.    It was decided that, although a railwayconnecting the development area to a temporary landing hard at Mkwaya on theLindi Creek would suffice while development was in its early stages,a more adequate port would, later be necessary.   A Government Missionrecommended the construction of a deep water berth port suitable for oceangoing vessels at Mtwara.    This recommendation was accepted and work on thenew port has been proceeding.    The railway connecting the development area toMkwaya was completed and opened on the 25th October, 1949.    The railway.,connection between Mtwara and this line is under construction.19. Under the revised plan proposed by the Overseas Food corporation the development in the Southern Province of Tanganyika will be on a much more limited scale than was originally intended and the expected volume ofCorporation traffic is correspondingly reduced.    On the basis of the new plan the Corporation do not consider that their needs if taken alone would justifythe completion of the new port of Mtwara.   But the Tanganyika Government

moproposes to undertake an intensive development plan in the Southern Provincewhich, over a period, will substantially increase other export and importtraffic over the railway.   The Tanganyika Government intends, subject to theapproval of the Legislative Council, to spend substantial sums in constructingand improving feeder roads, while the East African Railways and HarboursAdministration proposes to extend the railway 60 miles westward from thegroundnut area under guarantee by the Tanganyika Government, againsubject to the approval of the Legislative Council.    This is intended as thefirst stage of a westward extension of the railway to Lake Nyasa.    In the lightof these decisions by the Tanganyika Government and the East African .Railways and Harbours Administration the Corporation have agreed that theport of Mtwara and the railway connecting it with the existing line should becompleted.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that this conclusion is right and they have indicated to the Tanganyika Government and the east african Railways and Plarbours Administration that they warmly welcome the forward development policy being pursued.Finance20. The Corporation have reported that they are unable to comply with theprovisions of the Overseas Resources Development Act which require them to operate on a commercial basis, and to repay advances made to them from the consolidated Fund;   Parliamentary authority will, therefore, be sought for theamendment of the financial arrangements appertaining to the Corporation,including the writing off of all money advanced to the Corporation up to the timeof its transfer to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.    The necessary legislation will be introduced as soon as possible.    The Corporation have not felt able to indicate when, if ever, the new scheme can be expected to operate on a commercial basis.    Their operations will, therefore, be financed in futurefrom voted monies.   If it is found that the project, or some part of it, is able topay its way at the end of a development period, it may be possible to revive someof the capital at a future date,21. Although the scale of the undertaking has now to be reduced for thesecond time, and although the establishment of the scheme on an economic basisis not yet in sight, none t^e less His Majesty&apos;s Government remain convinced of the importance of the project.   As revised and redirected it can make a significant contribution to the economic development of East Africa and theresults of the experiments being undertaken in clearing and mechanised farmingtechniques may be of still wider significance and value in many tropicalterritories,
