DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS -BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET   -CP.(50) 294 - COPY NO.(3 ^2ND DECEMBER, 1950CABINETSOVIET PROPOSAL FOR A MEETING OF THECOUNCIL OF FOREIGN minister&apos;s memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will remember that in a note of the 3rd november the Soviet Government proposed that the Council of Foreign Ministers ofFrance, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics should meet to examine the question ofcarrying out the Potsdam Agreement on the demilitarisation of Germany.2. The United Nations General Assembly also passed on the 3rdNovember a Resolution calling upon the permanent members of theSecurity Council to meet and discuss, collectively or otherwise, and ifnecessary with other States concerned, the problems threatening, world peace and hampering the work of the United Nations.3. In the House of Commons on the 13th November I made a state-ment, of which my colleagues will be aware, setting out the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the Soviet Note.     I also referred to the united nations Resolution.     My statement followed the lines of the draft circu&quot;lated as Annex B to C.P.(50) 266, as amended in the light of the Cabinet5sdiscussion on 13th November (C.M.(50) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 3).Since my statement it has become clear that there is considerable feeling,in Parliament and in the country as a whole that the Western powers should not return a completely negative reply to the Russian note but should demonstrate that they have given constructive thought to thepossibilities of relieving the present international tension.     This state of feeling assumes, of course, that the Russian note which, on the face of it,was designed to weaken the resolve of the West to defend itself and wascarefully timed to prelude the World Peace Congress, contains the elements of a desire on the part of the Soviet Union to meet with the Western Powers.This, however, is by no means certain.4. It has now been agreed with the French and United States Govern-ments that officials of our three Governments should meet in Paris duringthe week beginning 4th December to consider on what basis we could enterinto an exchange of views with the Russians.5.     Soviet objectivesI think it is important first of all to be clear on the Russians1reasons for putting forward once again a proposal for such a meeting atthis time and for linking it with the proposals in the Prague communique.As on previous occasions, when they have resorted to similar diplomaticmanoeuvres, they are trying to stop a development in Western policy

In if*i Uunwelcome to themselves.     Their main purpose now is undoubtedly to delay the progress of plans to strengthen the defence of the West.     they realise that these plans will have made a good step forward if agreement is reached on an integrated Atlantic force for Western European defence and on a contribution to that force from the great resources of Germany.They hope therefore to confuse Western counsels while this agreement isbeing sought and in particular to take advantage of the difference ofopinion which is known to exist between the French and their partners inthe North Atlantic Treaty on this issue.6. Before we commit ourselves to inviting the Russians to a dis-cussion with the three Western Powers we must be clear whether thereis any basis for fruitful discussion.     As I made clear in my statement inthe House of Commons, we should not be prepared to enter into discussion on the basis of the Prague communique on Germany alone.     The UnitedStates and French Governments are also agreed on this point.7. It seems to me that the possible lines of approach to this problemmight be briefly described as follows:Course A      We might try to confine any talks with the Russians tothe problems of a particular region (such as Germanyand/or alternatively, the Far East), on which there might be some hope of achieving a partial settlement and a partial relaxation of tension.Course B      We might, in the same hope, invite the Russians todiscuss only the major points of friction throughoutthe world with a view at least, to eliminating them.Course C      We might present the Russians with a full statementof our terms for a global settlement of all our differenceswith them in order to try to establish an enduring basis -for better relations in future.Course D      We might make the Russians some proposal, their agreement to which would be a test of the sincerity oftheir intentions and on which agreement would thereforebe required before proceeding to any wider talks.Course E      We might propose preliminary informal talks at theofficial level and should set out a selected list of subjects, on which we should require satisfaction fromthe Russians as a result of any subsequent formalMinisterial talks.Course F      We might say that the existing Russian proposals basedon the Prague communique did not hold out adequatehope of successful talks and we might therefore call upon the Russians to put forward more attractiveproposals if they really desire talks leading to. a relaxation of tension.Courses A, B and C8. The first three courses outlined above would in fact represent an attempt to enter without further delay into talks designed to reach asettlement over a specified field.     I have examined these three

173-ft. S spossibilities and have reluctantly come to the conclusion that none ofthem offers any hopeful prospect of coming to a genuine agreement whichwould increase our security or hopes of permanent peace.     The argu-ments on which this conclusion is based are fully set out in Annex A tothis paper.     Briefly I am convinced that any attempt to reach a settlementeither in a single region or on major points of friction would at the presenttime be too dangerous for us to embark upon it.9. With regard to a global settlement - Course C above - I have explained in Annex A why I do not think it would be possible for theSoviet Government to accept our terms and why no concessions that wecould contemplate would persuade the Soviet Government to consider them.Moreover., if we published our terms for a global settlement in our replyto the Soviet note, the conclusion would probably be drawn that we were deliberately putting the price too high and were not serious in our attemptto find a basis for discussion.     In order to meet such criticism it mightbe possible to set out in the form of an agenda for the meeting the subjects which we should wish to discuss in trying to reach a global settlement,without necessarily indicating what we should wish to obtain under eachsubject,    I attach at Annex B the terms of such a possible agenda, but, asI have indicated already, the presentation of this agenda would merely bea move calculated to appeal to public opinion and would not in my viewincrease the chances of a. settlement.Course D10,        &quot; The fourth possibility is to demand from the Russians some priortest of their sincerity before entering into wider talks.     The sort of testswhich I have in mind would be to conclude some sort of non-aggression pact between the four Powers and to reach agreement on a satisfactory plan for the international control of atomic energy and for the reduction of con-conventional armaments.     It seems to me that this approach is open to threeobjections.     First.- it allows Russia to point to her existing disarmamentproposals which are designed for propaganda purposes only and are infact unacceptable.     Secondly, it could be objected that, by putting anagreement on atomic energy as one of our essential pre-conditions for a wider agreement, we were insisting on settling one of the most difficult problems first and therefore trying to obstruct fruitful discussions.Thirdly, it would in my view be dangerous to embark on any general schemeof disarmament until we had received some sign that the dangers against which we are now rearming had abated.Course E11. The fifth possible line of approach - to hold preliminary talks with a view to defining an agenda for a meeting of Foreign Ministers - isin essentials similar to the approach suggested in a draft reply to theSoviet note which the United States Government have sent to us with a request for our views,   , I attach the text of this draft reply at Annex C tothis paper.     If we adopted this course I do not suggest that we should agree with the exact wording of the United States draft.     In particular weshould wish to define more clearly the subjects which we wished to discuss..It would have to be made clear that these subjects were not necessarily themain existing points of friction but were matters on which the western powers required satisfaction from Russia.     In addition to such questions as th3 Austrian Treaty, the violation of the Balkan Peace Treaties, com-compliance with the United Nations Charter and the cessation of Communist

propaganda under Soviet direction (subjects which the United States draftlists),, they would,, I suggest^ have to include an agreement on the use ofthe veto and better&apos; treatment in the Soviet Union and other Communist-controlled states of Western nationals...    I do not think that it would be appropriate to bring up Far Eastern questions in any such list of subjects.    As I have made clear in Annex A these questions affectparticularly the policies of the United States and Chinese Governments..The disadvantage of this line of approach is that it leaves it open to theRussians to raise a list of points of their own and to demand satisfactionon them from us..    Nevertheless this line of approach shows a willing-ness to hold four-Power talks and widens their scope beyond the narrowbasis proposed by the Russians.The United States draft suggests that the proposed preliminarytalks should be held between representatives of the three Western Powersand the Soviet Union at the seat of the United Nations in New York.     I amin favour of this suggestion, since it would be difficult to persuade theSoviet Government to hold such a meeting in one of the three Westerncapitals, and. there are obvious objections to the three Western Powersagreeing, so to speak, to be summoned to Moscow for the meeting..Course F12. The final course mentioned in paragraph 7 above is to ask theRussians to put forward fresh and more constructive proposals.     TheUnited States Government, who were at first attracted by this possibleline, appear no longer to advocate it strongly.     It has the disadvantage ofhanding the initiative back to the Russians and leaving the way open forthem to make a new and specious &quot;peace&quot; offer.     On the other hand thiscourse has considerable attractions.    As I have already remarked, it isby no means certain that the original Russian proposal for a meeting ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers to examine the question of Germany onthe basis of the Prague communique was put forward with a genuine desire,for discussion..    Having rejected this basis for discussion, it would belogical for the Western Powers to ask the Soviet Government whether theycan suggest any other basis.     This would be a test of their sincerity.Moreover this course avoids most of the disadvantages which are inherent in the other possible courses of action.     On the other hand I recognisethat public opinion might not consider that we were making a sufficientlyconstructive approach to the Russians if we merely threw the ball back into their court.13. I have set out these alternatives somewhat fully for the considera-tion of my colleagues.     I consider that in reaching a decision we shouldtake account of two main factors.     First, although we should be preparedto enter into talks and to take any opportunity which offers^ of reducingtension even in a limited sphere, there is very little likelihood that talkswill lead to any real settlement of differences.    Secondly, we should sopresent our reply to the Soviet note as to make clear our genuine con-ciliatory approach to the possibility of talks without risking damage toany of our own interests.14. It seems to me that in the light of these two factors the choicewill really lie between a modification of Course C in paragraph 7 above,i. e. presenting the agenda on which a meeting might be held;   Course E,in which exploratory four-Power official talks would first be held;   andCourse F, in which we should invite the Russians to put forward fresh and constructive proposals.

15, The choice is very-difficult&apos;       I do not find myself prepareto re-commend strortgly-any of the three -courses...suggested in thepreceding paragraph, since I am conscious of the dangers attaching to all of them.     Before I make up my mind I should like a thoroughdiscussion with my colleagues.E.B.Foreign, Office, S.W.1,2ND DECF^LBE.R^JL9-50.

ANNEX APOSSIBLE WAYS OF SEEKING A settlement the main lines of approach which I have thought it worth while to examine are -(a) a global settlement of differences with Russia(b) a partial settlement confined to the problems of one region(c) a settlement of certain major outstanding points of friction.Aj    A Global SettlementTerms of a global settlement2. In considering what we should want to obtain from any settle-ment, we have to remember that we shall require the Russians not onlyto make certain promises but also to give us cause to expect thosepromises to be kept.    As I see it, therefore, our full terms for a globalsettlement should include satisfaction on the following points:(I)   Europe, the Middle East and Africa(a) The lifting of the Iron Curtain, which would mean(i) complete and final withdraw3! of the Red Army fromthe satellites(ii) followed by free elections in those countries supervisedby the United Nations(iii) full implementation of the peace treaties with Bulgaria,Hungary and Roumania(iv) free access to the Soviet Union, both for travel and forinformation material.(b) A unified Germany with a Government freely elected at inter-nationally supervise d elections (on the lines proposed by theThree Western Foreign Ministers at their meeting in May,1950) followed by a Peace Treaty and the withdrawal of alloccupation forces.(c) An Austrian Treaty, followed by the withdrawal of all occupationforces from that country.(d) A Russian undertaking to respect the authority of the freeGovernments of Western Europe in their metropolitan ordependent territories and to refrain from encouragingsubversion or sabotage through local Communist organisationsor trade unions.(e) A Russian undertaking to refrain in future from any interference in the internal affairs of Greece, Turkey or Persia, and fromany subversive activities, includinguse of local Communistparties or racial minoritie^ in the-sef- si^i-te^/vr elsewhere inthe Middle-Ea^^w^-^-c-S--

(II)   Far East and South and South East Asia(a)A Russian undertaking to refrain from supporting subversiveagencies and activities and to respect the rights of estab-lished Governments in the region.(b)Agreement on a settlement providing for a generally unified,independent and democratic Korea.(c)Agreement on the conclusion of a Japanese Peace Treaty.(d)An undertaking by the Soviet Government to use their good offices with the Chinese Government to ensure that Chinaalso refrained from aggression or subversive activities in Asia,(III) United Nations and Disarmament(a) Establishment of an effective international Atomic EnergyControl Agency, to hold in trust all atomic source materials,to have sole responsibility for research and development and to have unimpeded access to all countries at all timesfor inspection^ so as to ensure that no atomic weapons aremade.     Subject to the establishment of such an agency,agreement to destroy all existing stocks of atomic weapons.(b) Similar arrangements for the control of other majoroffensive weapons of war.(c) Agreement on a plan for conventional disarmament which will reduce Russian military strength to a level comparable withthe present strength of the West.(d) A &quot;gentleman&apos;s agreement&quot; to use the veto only in cases wherethe security of the country using it is directly affected andthen only after consultation among the permanent membersof the Security Council.(IV) PropagandaA general undertaking by the Soviet Government to renounce theuse of Communist propaganda as an instrument of their national policy.(V) Respect for the rule of law and diplomatic practice(a) Some evidence of Russian respect for the rule of law and forproper standards of international conduct (e. g. Russiansupport for the judgment of the International Court in theCorfu Channel case).(b) Russian agreement to allow Western diplomatic missions to operate in accordance with normal civilised practice,without hindrance or restriction, and to accord decenttreatment to nationals of foreign countries.(c) Agreement to establish consulates as necessary for normalpurposes within each other&apos;s territory.-a-

In fs0  Chances of obtaining a global settlement on these terms3. There are only two situations in which the Russians might bebrought to agree to a genuine settlement on such terms - (a) if they believed that the Western Powers would otherwise impose a settlement by force or (b) if they thought that they could extract concessions from us which would make it worth their while.4. Although there may be an element of.fear in the Russian .attitude to the West the Soviet Government would only accept a globalsettlement on these terms, which amounts in fact to a surrender in the&quot;cold war&quot;, if they were very much more frightened of a world warthan we believe them to be.     We can hardly hope for such a solutionuntil we in the West are much stronger.5. The Russians would be more likely to try to twist the termsof a settlement in their own favour.     They would interpret disarmamentas involving the destruction of the American stock of atom bombs and,in conventional weapons, as a cut of the same proportion to all existing national forces, thereby preserving their present advantage.     Theywould seek to impose a ban on all Western &quot;warmongering&quot; propaganda.They would generally try to make all the terms equally applicable tothe West and themselves.6. But even if they accepted a settlement on these terms, what sort of concessions would the Russians expect in return?    They would no doubt demand that the Chinese People&apos;s Government be recognised by the United States, admitted to the United Nations and granted controlof Formosa.     They would ask for East-West trade to be freed from control.     They might well want to see British and American basesremoved from the Middle East and service missions withdrawn from greece, Turkey and Persia.     They would certainly call for the&quot;liberation&quot; of dependent and colonial peoples.     They would undoubtedlygo further and demand some guarantees of Western peaceful intentions,including very probably a non-aggression pact, the dissolution of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the cessation of Western rearmament -ment and the withdrawal of American troops from Europe.7. It is quite clear that we and our Allies could not contemplatesuch concessions without absolute guarantees that the Russians would keep their part of the bargain.     But while the Soviet system and soviet policy remain what they are today no means of devising or exactingsuch guarantees exist;   if the Russians chose to break their promisesafter the&apos;North Atlantic Treaty was dissolved, American troops wereback in the United States, the Western nations had abandoned theirrearmament plans and destroyed their stock of atom bombs, Europe&apos;splight would indeed be sorry.     Clearly therefore the Russians wouldnot accept our requirements for a global settlement at any price whichwe could possibly pay.B.    A Partial SettlementIt remains to examine whether there is any form of partial orregional settlement that could conceivably be brought about at thepresent time and could be regarded as acceptable.

Germay and Austria9. The obvious possibility is a German settlement.     The Sovietnote suggests a meeting for the limited purpose of examining thequestion of carrying out the Potsdam agreement on the demilitarisationof Germany.     But its reference to and endorsement of the Praguecommunique suggests that the Soviet Government may be ready todiscuss a more comprehensive German settlement on the lines proposedin that communique, namely:(i)     a declaration by the four occupying Powers not to permit theremilitarisation of Germany, nor its inclusion in anyaggressive plans, and to execute the Potsdam agreement regarding the creation of prerequisites for the formationof a united, peace-loving democratic German state;(ii)     the removal of restrictions on the development of the peace-time German economy and the prohibition of the restorationof German war potential;(iii)     a peace treaty providing for restoration of German unity andfor withdrawal of all occupation troops within a year;(iv)     a Constituent Council, formed on a basis of equal representa-tion from East and West-Germany, to prepare and submit tothe four Powers proposals for the formation of an all-Germanprovisional Government and to take part in the negotiation of a peace treaty.10. These proposals are unacceptable both to the Western Alliesand to the German Federal Republic;   announcements to this effecthave been made by the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, theUnited States and France and by the German Chancellor.    But in viewof the Soviet Governmenfs evident desire to stop the rearmament ofthe West, and more immediately the rearmament of Germany, it ispossible that, in return for agreement by the Western Powers to calloff the rearmament of Germany, the Russians might be induced toagree to substantial modification of their proposals for a Germansettlement.11. . The proposals of the Western Powers for a German settlement where summarised in a document agreed upon by the three foreign ministers in London last May and later communicated by the three western High Commissioners to the Soviet authorities in Germany, whohave made no response.     The Western proposals, which were largelybased on more detailed proposals put forward in the Council of foreign ministers in Paris in 1949, were that free elections for a nationalconstituent Assembly should be held throughout Germany under inter-national supervision and on the basis of an electoral law agreed by thefour occupying Powers in accordance with recognised principles of individual freedom and constitutional rights.     In addition provision must be made for the prohibition of secret and para-military police,measures to ensure German economic unity, surrender of Soviet-controlled industrial enterprises and establishment of quadripartitesupervision pending a peace treaty.     Upon the formation of a freelyelected all-German Government on the basis of these principles and inaccordance with the constitution drawn up by the constituent assembly and ratified by the German people the Four Powers would proceedimmediately to a peace settlement. ., ,-4-

12. The essential elements of these proposals must form part ofany German settlement that is to be acceptable to the Western Powersand to the German people.     In addition it is indispensable for theWestern Powers that the settlement should contain provisions designedto ensure that Germany did not become a mere neutral vacuum highlyvulnerable to Soviet Communist pressure and penetration.     It is unlikely that at present any settlement would be acceptable to theRussians which did not provide both for the withdrawal of occupationtroops and for the demilitarisation of Germany.     This would meannot only that Germany would possess no armed forces or war industry of her own but also that her territory and resources could not be usedfor the purposes of Atlantic defence or (as the Russians would put it)as a springboard for Western aggression.     To protect such a de-militarised Germany against eventual absorption into the Soviet orbitit would be necessary to ensure at the very least that under the termsof the settlement Germany would be free to maintain a close association in political and economic matters with Western Europe and that she should be able to enjoy membership of the United Nations, the Councilof Europe, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation andother political, economic and technical international organisations.13. Furthermore, any settlement on Germany would have to be accompanied by agreement on the treaty restoring full independence to Austria and providing for the withdrawal of occupation troops.This treaty is, of course, fully drafted and its conclusion has been held up solely because the Soviet Government has raised a series of minor and often extraneous points as excuses for delaying the conclusion of atreaty which will lead to the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Austria.14. It is most improbable that the Soviet Government would agree in present circumstances to a German and Austrian settlement on theselines.    Nevertheless it is worth while examining the advantages and disadvantages of such a settlement in order to decide whether it wouldbe in our interest to seek to secure one.15. The advantages might be summarised as follows:-(a) A detente, such as the world badly needs, would be broughtabout over a very important field of relations between theSoviet orbit and the free nations.(b) The constant threat of a serious incident on the boundariesbetween the Soviet and Western Zones of Germany and austria or in Berlin and Vienna would be removed.(c) The Western Allies would be spared the burden ofgarrisoning Western Germany,(d) Soviet troops would be withdrawn behind the Westernboundaries of Poland and Hungary.(e) 20 million Germans and Austrians would be liberated.(f) Germany would achieve the unity which is a cardinal aim o:all sections of German opinion.

o r.&apos;0 t)(g)     The difficulties and risks inherent in any attempt to rearmGermany would be avoided arid the danger of Westerninvolvement in a war for the recovery of the Easternterritories would be reduced.16. The disadvantages would be the following: -(a) The detente in Europe might render it difficult to retainpopular support in Western Europe for the continuation of an active rearmament programme such as will remainessential until a general settlement has been secured.(b) There might well be a corresponding weakening of Americaninterest in Europe, with repercussions in the economic andpolitical as well as military spheres.(c) It would be difficult to maintain the impetus behind thedevelopment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationinto an effective and closely-knit community and encouragement would be given to circles in France and elsewhere which favour policies of neutrality.(d) If United States troops were not withdrawn from Europealtogether, arrangements would have to be made to stationthem in France and other Western European countries andthis would give rise to very serious and possibly insuperablepolitical and psychological difficulties.(e) The opportunity of securing the use of German territory,man-power and resources to ensure the effective defenceof the West would have been lost.(f) The unilateral demilitarisation of Germany, even if acceptedby the Germans at first as the necessary price of unity,would become increasingly unpopular and difficult to enforcewith the passage of time.(g) The struggle between East and West for possession of anunarmed Germany would sooner or later be resumed andthe risk that the whole of Germany might fall into the Sovietorbit could never be wholly removed;   it might indeed beincreased by a growing sense of grievance in the Germansthat the Western Allies, by agreeing to their countryrsdemilitarisation, had let them down after holding out promises of eventual full equality in the European community.(h) Soviet Russia, protected by a neutral belt in Europe, would beleft free to pursue her aggressive policy with renewedvigour in other parts of the world until she was ready to turn west again.17. The disadvantages of any settlement limited to Germany and austria outweigh the advantages.     The idea should accordingly not be pursued in any discussions with the Soviet Government.18. Nor would a limited settlement in this area be made substan-tially less unacceptable to the Western Powers if it were to be accompanied by further Soviet concessions in Eastern and Western

1 o PlayEurope, on the lines indicated in (I), (a), (d) and (e) in paragraph 2 ofthis Annex, in addition to the necessary concessions over Germanyand Austria,     In fact any European settlement, so long as it was notaccompanied by a Far Eastern settlement and a firm guarantee of a radical change of Soviet policy and behaviour throughout the world,would involve grave dangers for the West and advance the soviet union&apos;s cause by enabling her to pursue the cold war on one front ata time.The Far East19. The next possibility to consider is whether a partial settlement could be reached on some other issues, not concerned with Germanyand Austria.     The most likely field, and indeed the only field with many issues in dispute, wo^ld be in the Far East.    An attempt couldbe made perhaps to settle questions affecting Korea, Formosa, Chineseambitions in Asia, the security of the countries of South-East Asia.20. Our main requirements for a settlement in this region are setout in section II of paragraph 2 of this Annex.     It is clear that most ofthese requirements would have to be met by China.    An attempt tosettle them with Russia alone even if Russia agreed to do so would be -open to two objections:   we should have no guarantee that China wouldin fact abide by the terms of any agreement and by entering such talkswe should lay ourselves open to the charge of regarding China as aninconsiderable satellite of Russia,    But it is much more likely that russia would only agree to talks about the Far East in the presence ofa Chinese Communist representative;   it is almost certainly too early to expect the Americans to join in such conversations if the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government were to be represented.21. In fact the American attitude is crucial to any attempt to confine a settlement to the Far East.     The price which we should haveto pay to induce the Russians to accept our terms would almost certainlyinclude some sort of &quot;cushion&quot; in Korea between the United nations forces and the Manchurian border, the general acceptance of the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government by the United Nations and some arrangement forthe neutralisation of Formosa under the United Nations, leadingeventually to its return to Chinese control.     The price might well be higher but all the payments fall to be made by the United States Govern-ment and there is no reason to think that they are willing to pay them.C.    Settlement of major points of friction22. The third possibility which I have examined is a settlement of major points of friction, not confined to any one region, between theSoviet Government and the Western Powers.     In some ways thepossibility is superficially the most attractive since it holds out a hopethat, if it were successful, the main factors making for international tension could be eliminated and other problems could.then be attacked in a more promising atmosphere.23. But I am afraid that I find it difficult to take a very optimisticview of this line of approach either.     To begin with, the main points of friction are in fact those which I have already examined in consideringthe chances of a partial or regional settlement - Germany, Austria,Korea, the position of Communist China, Formosa.     I have already

explained my reasons for thinking that we cannot achieve a satisfactory settlement covering these points and that, even if some specious agreement could be reached, it would be likely to prove illusory 6&apos;r indeeddangerous to our real, long-term interests.     These problems are thesame whether considered in the context of a regional settlement or inany other context.24, Moreover, any attempt to settle outstanding, points of frictionin this way would undoubtedly lead to bargaining, in which points ofadvantage in one question would be set off against concessions in another.     Enough has been said to show that, while concessions wouldmean a real loss of Western influence, any advantages gained would bemore apparent than real, at least until we  saw whether the russians would abide by their undertakings;25. But above all it is important to be quite clear in our own. mind that the present points of friction are only symptoms of an underlyingconflict.     If we eliminate these points of friction - perhaps at somecost to each side - there is no reason to think that our chances ofestablishing better general relations will be improved.     Fresh points of friction will no doubt arise elsewhere, so long as the Soviet Govern-ment continues its policy of expansion and subversion wherever it seesan opening.     Without a real change of heart and policy on the part ofRussia - of which there are no signs whatever - and without a realmeasure of disarmament such as will lessen the actual danger of attack, a policy of eliminating points of danger will only amount tofrittering away positions of strength.     The policy of wisdom must beto continue to stand firm at the danger-points themselves, or at any new danger points which may arise.

ANNEX CPROPOSED REPLY TO THE SOVIET NOTE OF3RD &quot;NOVEMBER,, 1 950; SUGGESTING A further meeting OF THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGN ministers the Embassy of the United States has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Soviet Ministry of Fofeign Affairs note of 3rd November,1950, which enclosed the text of the Praha Declaration and proposedcalling the Council of Foreign Ministers of the United States, UnitedKingdom, France and the U.S.S.R. to consider the question of fulfilment ofthe Potsdam Agreement regarding demilitarisation of Germany.The United States Government, together with the Governments ofthe United Kingdom and France, has always sought to co-operate in finding a plan which would restore German unity and liquidate the tragicheritage of the last war.    As late as 9th October, 1950, the three Govern-ments, through their High Commissioners in Germany, urged again uponthe Soviet Union a plan for free, open, supervised democratic elections inall Germany for a constitutional convention, which could lead to thecreation of a German Government responsive to the.will of the Germanpeople.     The formation of such a truly democratic and representative government is a prerequisite to any discussion of a peace treaty withGermany.The United States Government had already noted, with disappoint-ment, the contents of the Praha Declaration which, far from offering hope for a new and constr-active, approach to the settlement of the german problem, was a step backward to old discredited proposals which meetnone of the facts or principles drawn to the attention of the Governmentof the U.S.S.R. at the last Council of Foreign Ministers.     Thus theU.S.S.R. has again disappointed the hopes of the world that the threats to peace, inherent in the present division of Germany, might be lifted by theone Government which is responsible therefor, namely the U.S.S,R.The United States Government can see in the Praha declaration and in the Soviet proposal for a new Council of Foreign Ministers no assurance of a sincere desire on the part of the Soviet Government for an equitable and lasting solution to existing problems.    At the last meetingof the Foreign Ministers in May-June, 1949, agreement was reached onthe essential elements for the prompt conclusion of an Austrian StateTreaty.     Yet since that time the Soviet Government, far from carrying outthe decisions reached at the Council of Foreign Ministers, has, by repeatedintroduction of new and irrelevant issues, made it impossible to conclude that treaty and restore to the Austrian people full sovereignty in accordancewith the Moscow declaration of 1943.     The Government of the UnitedStates would be more hopeful of the fruitfulness of a new Council ofForeign Ministers if the Soviet Government were to give effectiveimplementation to the decisions of the last Council of Foreign Ministers.The United States Government notes that the Government of theU.S.S.R. specifically, proposes that the Council of Foreign Ministers con-sider the question of fulfilling the Potsdam Agreement regarding the de-militarisation of Germany.     This proposal seeks to ignore the longhistory of Soviet violations of the demilitarisation provisions of the potsdam Agreement and in particular the already well advanced rearmament -ment taking place in Eastern Germany.     This rearmament is particularlyominous in the light of the words of such a well-known spokesman asWalter Ulbricht, Deputy Head of the East German regime, who said on

3rd August that the Government of the Federal Republic would share what he hoped would be the fate of the Republic of Korea.    Against whom arethose threatening preparations being made?     The West Germans, who liedisarmed at this moment as a result of Western fulfilment of the PotsdamAgreement, and all other free people have a right to ask this question withprofound misgiving.     They have seen peace shattered by Communistaggression under all too similar circumstances in Korea.The proposal of the Soviet Government for a Council of foreign ministers must therefore be considered in the light of aggressive actionsand threats throughout the world by Communist groups, Governments and individuals, and in the light of the continued maintenance of heavily &quot;mobilised Soviet and other Communist forces, including the   so-called&quot;alert troops&quot; in Eastern Germany.     It is these actions and threats whichhave compelled the free nations of the world to plan for an improvementof their common defences and to examine the ways in which the Germanpeople could legitimately participate without creating an aggressive military force such as has been built up in the Soviet Zone.     Under these circum-stances the United States Government can only conclude that the intent ofthe Praha Declaration was to attempt further to confuse world opinion asto where the blame lies for the failure to solve the German problem and todeflect the West from its resolve to build real strength in a free world asthe best means of safeguarding the peace, to the maintenance of which all members of the United Nations are pledged.     The Declaration and theSoviet Governments note of 3rd November seek to delude the world bycallously playing upon the heartfelt desire of all peoples for true and lasting peace.     Until Soviet-inspired Communist actions around the worldbear testimony to the sincerity of Soviet words, there would seem to belittle basis for a successful resolution of fundamental problems such as germany in the Council of Foreign Ministers. ^Yet Germany and Austria are not the only areas of international tension which will have to be considered if these tensions are to be removedor at least lessened sufficiently to permit the world to live in peace and hope for the future.     Other international difficulties must be discussed andsolutions found if a real settlement is genuinely sought by the SovietGovernment.     If conversations were to be agreed upon between therepresentatives of the Soviet, United States, British and French Govern-ments, the United States Government would desire to discuss a variety of matters not all of which properly fall within the jurisdiction of the Councilof Foreign Ministers.     These matters would include questions such as theAustrian State Treaty, the Soviet-supported violations of the peace treatiesby Hungary, Bulgaria, and Rumania, compliance with the.United nations charter with especial regard to the elimination of the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any nation,events in Korea which threaten peace and other problems causing inter-national tensions&apos;, such as the activities and declared objectives of theSoviet-directed international Communist movement.     The United StatesGovernment is ready, as it has been and always will be, to co-operate ingenuine efforts to find peaceful settlements of all these questions.Recognising the gravity of these issues which threaten the peace ofthe world, the 302nd Plenary Session of the General Assembly of the united nations adopted on 3rd November, 1950, several resolutions, one of which,introduced by the delegations of Iraq and Syria, called upon the permanent members of the Security Council to &quot;meet and discuss, collectively or

4  &quot;&apos;. 4otherwise and, if necessary, with other states concerned, all problems which are likely to threaten international peace and hamper theactivities of the United Nations&quot;.     If the.Soviet Government shoulddesire, the United States Government would be willing to examinealong with the British, French and Soviet Governments whether there exists a mutually acceptable basis for reaching a settlementof certain outstanding issues.     It would appear that the presence ofrepresentatives of the above named Governments at the seat of theUnited Nations in New York presents the most convenient opportunityto conduct such a preliminary examination.     For its part the UnitedStates Government would be willing to authorise a representative to explore the issues at hand-with similarly authorised representativesof the Soviet, British and French Governments.
