DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (50), 2ft6 . COPY NO. 3228TH NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETCOAL:   PRIORITY FOR POWER STATIONSMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power the decision which we have taken to authorise the national coal Board to import 1 million tons of coal, though valuable in itself, isonly a first step towards restoring a balance between supplies and essential requirements.   It will give us a little more elbow room,  &apos;for, once the first shipments arrive, we shall be able, in a way that isat present impossible, to direct supplies of foreign coal to those groups of consumers who are most short of supplies and therefore nearest toclosing down through lack of supplies.   But when we get these imports, weshall, unless current output improves, be left with a shortage of up to2 million tons.   Even if (as I recommend in C.P, (50) 285) we cutexports during the remainder of the winter by another million tons, we shallstill be left with a deficit of up to 1 million tons - a deficit which might bestill larger, if production were to decline further.2. It will be seven or eight weeks before we can hope to getsubstantial assistance from the measures discussed above.   Till theni weshall therefore have to make good as best we can with the coal currentlyproduced in this country.   Every week since coal production sank to belowthe level of last year, the National Coal Board has been unable to deliver, to each group of consumers the full amount of coal which it was entitled to expect under its winter programme.   In consequence, allthat the Board has been able to do has been to spread out the available supplies as evenly as possible among the various groups of inland consumers.Normally, over short periods of deficiency, this is clearly the right course to take;  but in a period of acute shortage such as the present, it involvessome serious risks, and especially the risk that the power stations may run outof coal.   The present paper is to ask for approval for special measures toprevent the power stations from running into too dangerous a position,before we can support them by the coal which we have arranged to import.3.     Power Stations:    The power stations started, the winter in a much weakerposition than any other group of inland consumer, for their end-summerstocks fell short of the target by 480,000 tons.   In order to help them tomaintain their stocks till Christmas, an arrangement was made by which for the first eight weeks of the winter their programme was increased by20,000 tons a week..   Unfortunately, with production at its current low.level,there has not been enough coal to enable the Coal Board during the first threeweeks of the winter to give the power stations the whole of the programme which it is agreed that they need.   The British Electricity Authorityestimate that the supplies which they have received during this period fell

short by 96,000 tons of the amount to which they were entitled under their programme;   the National Coal Board does not dissent from thisview.   Moreover, partly as a result of the cold weather, consumption byBritish Electricity Authority stations during these three weeks hasbeen 40-45,000 tons more than had been expected.   On balance, therefore,during these weeks, the British Electricity Authority stations havealready had to reduce their already inadequate stocks by 140,000 tons.4. The Coal Board estimate that, on present prospects, it will notbe possible for them to supply the power stations with more than 94%of the programme during the first ten weeks of the winter.   This means that by the end of the first week in January, 1951, power stations&apos; coalstocks will not exceed 3. 15 million tons (4 weeks&apos; consumption)and will be 850,000 tons (1, 1 weeks&apos; consumption) less than they were atthe end of the first week of January, 1950, when they amounted to 4 million tons (5.6 weeks&apos; consumption).   Thus the power stations would enter the most critical stage of the winter with quite inadequate stocks.5. As we know from the experience of the fuel crisis of 1947, it takes a considerable time to build up stocks at power stations, Once these have been allowed to fall too low.   It would; therefore, be quite impracticable to build up power stations&apos; stocks rapidly from imports.   What isnecessary, if the power stations are to be kept going, is to prevent their stocks from falling to too low a level during the time that we are waiting for imports to arrive.   The National Coal Board have, therefore,recommended that the present augmented programme for the power stations should be continued, and that a priority should be given to coal forthe power stations at least up to 6th January, 1951, when we ought to be ableto see better what is going to happen about imports.   I fully support thisproposal, which seems to me absolutely essential, if we are to preventthe power stations getting into such difficulties in January as to render a stoppage of electricity supply in February virtually inevitable.6, I accordingly ask for authority to instruct the Coal Board that,in any week in which total supplies fall short of the amount needed to meet all the inland programmes, the power stations are to be given their full requirements, even though this means (as it certainly will) that industry will receive less than would otherwise be the case.   We must face the factthat we shall not have enough coal, during these weeks, to meet thefull requirements both of the power stations and of industry.   Both areof the highest importance, but if a choice has to be made, it is clear thatit should be in favour of the power stations;   for if the power stations were to go out through lack of fuel, all industry would go out with them;and this applies to firms which still have some coal supplies, as wellas those which have none,7.     Gas Works:     The gas works, like the power stations, failed to achieve their end-summer target;  but the deficiency was smaller, amounting to190,000 tons.   So far this winter the gas works, by using their carburettedwater gas plant to the full, have managed to increase their coal stocksslightly though they are still 150,000 tons below the end-summer target.For the moment, therefore, the gas works are holding their position, andthey have a fair chance of continuing to do so, provided that throughout thewinter it is physically possible to use their carburetted water gas plant to full capacity.   The gas works would, however-, become very vulnerable, iflater there were any failure of electricity supply, for in that event anyconsumer who could use gas in place of electricity would certainly try to do so.

8,     House coal:     The problem of house coal supplies stands apart fromthat of other groups of inland consumption, for it is essentially a problem of how best to distribute the limited supplies of large coalavailable.   At the present time supplies of large coal are suffering in two ways:  first, because of the low level of total coal production;   second,because, as. the result of mechanisation, the proportion of large coal to total production is constantly falling,   Of the total weekly supplies of large coal (about 1. 3 million tons) almost exactly one half is earmarked forthe house coal market;   the next largest consumers are the railways,which take about 280,000 tons a week;   these are followed by the gasworks and industrial consumers of all kinds, each of which takes about100,000 tons a week,   The gas works are forced back upon large coalthrough the even greater shortage of graded coal;   the consumption oflarge coal by industry has already been drastically reduced, and at presentrepresents only about 12% of its total consumption.   The decisionsalready taken about bunkers may make it possible to find smalladditional quantities of large coal for the domestic consumer, because some bunker coal can be given to the railways.   Nothing more can bedone until the imports arrive.   Even then, the assistance which may be hoped for will not go far towards assuring even the low level of housecoal supplies planned for&apos;this winter;   for with an overall deficit ofat least 2, 5 million tons on the budget, supplies to the domestic marketwill, unless current output improves, inevitably fall short by about750,000 tons (4.3%).   It is true that consumers&apos; cellars are rather betterstocked than they were a year ago;   and purchases of house coal inNovember and December may therefore be less than in the same periodlast year.   But even so merchants1 stocks are likely to fall to about1. 5 million tons by 6th January;   and if they do they would be 200,000tons less than at the beginning of 1950.P.
