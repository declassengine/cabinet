IS DOCUMENT IS-THE PROPERTY- OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) Z85 COPY NO. O faZ8TH NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETCOAL EMERGENCY MEASURES:IMPORTS AND EXPORTSMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power in pursuance of the instructions given by the Cabinet at their meeting on 17th November (C.M.(50) 75th Conclusions, Minute 3), theNational Coal Board were authorised to purchase coal abroad.(i)     The Board have now reported the purchase of 825,000 tons ofgood American coal at a reasonable price.(ii)     Qualities of South African coal offered were poor (16% ashcontent);   but better qualities may be on offer later on, and, if so, theywill be accepted;   but the quantities will be small.(iii)     Indian coal is unsuitable because both of quality and of the riskof spontaneous combustion on the voyage.(iv)     The position on Polish coal is that at Geneva a few days ago, thePolish representative on the Economic Commission for EuropeCommittee privately informed the representative of the National coal board that the Poles would be prepared to offer up to 1 million tons ofcoal, on the understanding that this would be negotiated under the Anglo-Polish Trade Agreement (and that they would expect a quid pro quo in theform of United Kingdom goods of a kind especially useful to them\    As a preliminary step the Overseas Negotiations Committee are, I understand,preparing an analysis of the possible impact of a quid pro quo on our commercial relations with Poland.     I understand that in view of its manypolitical and other implications the Foreign Secretary would wish thisproposal to be considered by the Cabinet.2. Shipping has not yet been secured for the American coal, but theNational Coal Board expect to be able to bring in a few cargoes before theend of the year, but none before the third week in December.     the quantities that could be imported during January, February and March (thecriticial months) would be limited by the ceiling imposed by shipping and port landing facilities, and this question is being examined, in conjunctionwith the National Coal Board, by officials of the Ministry of Fuel and Power,the Ministry of Transport and the Central Economic Planning Staff.3. The matter is still under consideration, but I am informed that the officials are satisfied that the position is, broadly, as follows:-&apos; (i)     Under normal arrangements, 300,000 to 350,000 tons of UnitedStates coal per month could be imported in January, february and March.

This rate might be stepped up to 400,000 tons a month by a variety of special measures, e. g. by continuous working.If Polish coal were imported, a further 100,000 tons a monthcould be brought in, by using small ships at a different range of United Kingdom ports.These rates represent a maximum and the difficulties &quot;mayprevent it from being fully attained.Thus, we may expect to import a maximum of 1. 2 million tonsof coal during the critical period January to March next (or 1. 5 million   -tons if Polish coal can be bought.)In these circumstances, I recommend that the National coal board should be authorised to arrange for the import of this quantity,1, 2 million tons, before the end of March (plus the few cargoes that canbe bought in the last days of December/.I further recommend that we should decide as so*n as possible on our attitude towards the purchase of Polish coal, and that, if we decide to buy some, that we should try to get some shipped in December, if thatis possible.4. But even if we secure these imports on the maximum scale, wemay still be faced with a serious situation.     On 14th November, I reportedthat the gap to be bridged, if we were to avoid a critical shortage, was nearly Z\ million tons;   in the light of the tendency disclosed by two moreweeks&apos;  figures, I must now report.that the gap may be more than Z\million tons, and will be 1 million tons more, if output continues at itspresent rate of 80,000 tons below last year&apos;s output.     If the saving on imports and bunkers does not exceed 1.1/3 million tons (or just overljr million-tons if Polish coal is included) the gap will not be less than million tons and may be 2 million tons.5. How much can we expect from the efforts to revive the autumncoal production drive?    It is impossible to say.     I saw the NationalUnion of Mineworkers (N.U.M.) and the National Coal Board last weekand set them a target of 50,000 tons a week above (instead of 80,000 tonsbelow) last year&apos;s figures.     The N.U.M. have gone away to discuss thematter and have promised me their views very soon.     When I have them,I will report again to the Cabinet but I must warn my colleagues that,while this extra 130,000 tons a week would bridge the gap, and while some members of the N.U.M. Executive have told me that they think the targetcan and will be reached, I do not think we are entitled to base our policy on that assumption.     Indeed, the N.U.M, leaders made it plain that thereare two factors which disturb them:(i) In several Divisions the miners are &quot;sour&quot; as a result of therecent wages award.(ii) While miners are sticking to their jobs until Christmas (andwastage is now low) we must expect that after Christmas minerswill leave&apos; the industry in considerable numbers.     I agree withthe Union&apos;s views on this, for every year there is a markedreduction in wastage in the weeks immediately precedingChristmas, and after Christmas we must expect a resumption of wastage.     &quot;We cannot hold our members&quot; the Union said,&quot;against the attraction of all the jobs that other industries areoffering&quot;.(ii)(iii)(iv)

9 oc&amp; 06. And unfortunately we cannot afford to wait until we know whetherthe drive for extra output will succeed or not.    Unless we are preparedto gamble on its success, we must, I think, take the only other step thatis open to us, and cut the rate of export again.    The question of a furthercut in export was analysed in the First Report of the Official coal committee (paragraph 6(iv) and Annex III) circulated with CP.(50) 271.The decision must be taken now;    otherwise it will not be possible to cut export much before the end of January - to* late to help with aFebruary crisis, if we should have one.     The effect, of a cut on the economy of our overseas customers will be serious enough, even if theyhave a month&apos;s warning, and it would be criminal to cut them without aminimum period of a month&apos;s notice to enable them to try and make other arrangements.7. With so much at stake, and with the odds still long against asufficient increase in output, I do not think we can gamble on the chance that, at this late date, increased output will get us out of our difficulties.I must in consequence recommend that exports should be cut by 1 million tons, in the way contemplated in the report from the Overseas Negotia-tions Committee to be circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as c,P,(50) 287.     I would urge that a decision to do this should be taken without delay, in order that instructions can be issued to the national coal Board before the end of the week, and the export cut begin to operate in the first week in January:   each week&apos;s delay may mean a loss to exports of the order of 60,000 tons of coal that may be urgently neededhere.8. If output does after all rise, as we hope it may, we can, of course,easily restore our export cuts;  but if output does not rise, and if we havenot cut our exports, we may have better cause to regret it.P.J.N.-B./linistry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1,28TH NOVEMBER, 1950.
