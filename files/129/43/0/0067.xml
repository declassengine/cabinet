HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;&amp; GOVERNMENT) fiI273CONFIDENTIALCP. (50) 31715TH DECEMBER, 1950COPY NO.32CABINETROAD SAFETY - EMl-^OYMENT OF POLICE MOTORPATROLS IN PLAIN CLOTHESMemorandum fay the Home secretary i have recently been considering, in consultation with the Ministerof Transport, whether we can, within our available resources of finance and man-power, improve or intensify police supervision of motor traffic withthe object of securing some reduction in the very serious figures of roadcasualties with which we are now faced.   Examination of this general problem is proceeding but there is one specific point which I would like to put to my colleagues at once.2. Police supervision of motor traffic can naturally best be carriedout by policemen in cars or on motor-cycles and only a policeman in uniformcan require the driver of a car to stop.   Supervision of traffic mayoccasionally, at the discretion of an individual Chief Constable, be undertaken by plain clothes police but the work is almost invariably done by men in uniform.    (&quot;Where plain clothes car patrols are used the police can concealtheir uniforms by a mackintosh or raincoat:   when they want to stop a carthey can take off the raincoat and put on their uniform caps).   The question a tissue is whether this does not weight the scales too heavily in favour of themotorist and whether the knowledge - or fear  - that plain clothes police may beon the road would not have a substantial and beneficial effect on the roadbehaviour of the average motoring member of the public.3. I recognise that this is a difficult problem and that it is one onwhich opinion is divided even within the police service.    I believe that someChief Constables of experience feel that to employ plain clothes motor patrolsfor the purpose of catching motorists who break the law would be regarded bythe general public as unsporting and that relations between police and public might suffer.    There are on the other hand Chief Constables who think thatthe judicious employment of plain clothes patrols might well produce an effect on road behaviour out of all proportion to the numbers employed andthat it could be justified on the facts of road casualties.4. Looking at the position dispassionately there i&apos;  clearly an amplecase for any measures which would secure a higher standard of road-behaviourand so reduce the appalling figures of road casualties.   A motorist who drivesdangerously or carelessly breaks the law just as much as a man who picksa pocket or engages in street bookmaking;   the only difference is that the resultsof breaches of the law by motorists are likely to be so much more serious tohuman life.    There can, therefore, be no objection of principle to the employ-ment by the police of the means best suited to prevent and detect offences.On the other hand one cannot discount the feeling which exists even inside the police service that motoring offences are in some ways different in kindfrom other classes of offences and that public opinion might not support thepolice in the employment of methods which are regarded as natural and desirable in any other field.

5. On consideration of the whole problem I am disposed to thinkthat the need to, reduce the appalling toll of suffering implicit in thefigures of road casualties must be regarded as paramount and that it wouldbe well, with the co-operation of selected Chief Officers of Police, toorganise an experiment involving the employment of plain clothes police officers for the purpose of detecting and dealing with road behaviour of sucha kind as to involve a risk to human life.   It would, of course, be for the responsible Chief Officers of Police to decide how such patrols would beemployed but I would hope that they would see the wisdom of refraining from using them to detect such offences as&apos;breaches of the speed limit  -in circumstances which clearly do not involve any risk to human life;on the other hand they would be able to deal with the sort of behaviour whichnever occurs in the presence of a uniformed policeman such as grosslyinconsiderate driving, ignoring pedestrian crossings, cutting in atdangerous points, overtaking at blind corners and so on.   Accordingly,I would ask my colleagues to agree in principle to my inviting selectedChief Constables to undertake an experiment on these lines and to apublic announcement that this is being done.J .C.
