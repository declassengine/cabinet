DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)2^8SECRET &quot; - uCP. (50) 311 COPY NO.     3 212TH DECEMBER, 1950CABINETGERMAN PARTICIPATION IN THE DEFENCEOF WESTERN europe memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs circulate to my colleagues herewith (Annex &apos;A&apos;) a summary,prepared in the Foreign Office, of the points contained in the reports of theNorth Atlantic Council Deputies and the North Atlantic Military Committee,relating to the conditions of a German contribution to the integratedAtlantic force.   The reports themselves are long and still subject tominor revision, and I do not think the Cabinet need read them at this stage,2. The two reports, when finally approved and put together at ajoint meeting of the Deputies and the Military Committee, will come beforethe North Atlantic Defence Committee and the North Atlantic Council for final approval in the name of the Governments concerned.   These twoMinisterial Committees have been called to meet in Brussels on Monday next, 18th December, and I need the authority of the Cabinet for the line i should adopt in regard to them.3. If the Atlantic Council approves the substance of these reports,the way will be clear for the following next steps:-(a) a request to the High Commissioners of the three occupying powers in Western Germany &quot;to discuss with the german federal Government the question of German participation in the defence of Western Europe&quot; along the lines set forth in the two reports;(b) the calling by the French Government of &quot;a conference of thecountries (including the German&apos;Federal Republic) which may wish to participate in a European Army&quot;.Extent to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed4. His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed, vis-a-vis the otherNorth Atlantic Treaty Governments, to the principle of a German contributionto Western defence.    This commitment was accepted when I was in New York inSeptember last (C. M. (50) 59th Conclusions, Minute 1).   Our acceptanceof this principle at that time was based on the understanding that it formed a necessary part of a broadcasting.d plan in which the Americans would nominate a supreme Commander for the integrated Atlantic force and undertake to sendsubstantial reinforcements to Europe during 1951.    Unfortunately, this broadplan could not be put into effect immediately owing to French unwillingnessto accept even the principle of a German contribution except underrestrictive conditions and in combination with their own ideas for a european army,   During the months that ensued while this was under discussion,

2 4 t?the situation deteriorated in the following respects:-(a) The Americans began to take the line that they requiredmore than a mere acceptance of the principle and that they couldnot nominate the Supreme Commander or agree to send reinforce-ments to the integrated force until they actually had a &quot;sight&quot;of the German contribution.   At one time they said that their plan could not come into operation until a favourable reply hadbeen received from the German Government.   Later this becamemodified, and their present position seems to be that theycould nominate General Eisenhower as Supreme Commander assoon as the &quot;Spofford compromise&quot; (i. e. the substance of thepresent reports) had been agreed within the North atlantic treaty Organisation, but before the approach has been made to theGerman Federal Government.(b) The widespread publicity which has been given to these discussionshas led to a hardening of German opinion against participationon any terms but those of complete equality.(c) The events in the Far East have reduced the prospect of earlyeffective American reinforcements in Europe..:: . &apos;.&apos; . &apos;: . , &quot;; &apos;    ::&apos; , 777,;:-&apos;For the above reasons it can legitimately be said that the conditions in which weare called upon to accept the present plans for German participation are different from those in which we committed ourselves, in September last,to the principle of a German contribution.5, As regards the Deputies1 plan itself, His Majesty1 s Governmentare not formally committed.    The United Kingdom Deputy, acting on my instructions, has given his approval to the Deputies&apos; report but the report isstill subject to Ministerial approval, and it is well understood that the atlantic council may have comments to make on the substance of the plan and on details.In particular, the United Kingdom Deputy has reserved my position in regardto the timing of the approach to the German Federal Government which would follow acceptance of the plan.Implications of acceptance of the Plan by the North Atlantic Council.6. The implications of acceptance of this plan by the North atlantic council may be considered under three heads:   first, its possible effect onSoviet policy;   second, the likely reaction of the Germans themselves to the plan;and thirdly, the attitude of the United States Government to the plan, withparticular reference to their willingness to appoint a Supreme Commander and toproceed to build up the integrated force.-Possible effect on Soviet policy7. I have felt bound to consider most seriously what might be the reaction of the Soviet Government to an announcement that the north atlantic Powers had formally agreed upon a scheme for the rearmament of Germanyand were about to approach, or had approached, the German Government tothat end.    I had to bear in mind that the circumstances in which we would betaking this action are entirely different from those which obtained when wefirst agreed with the Americans that it was safe to embark on german rearmament.   At that time, there had been good hopes that the Koreasituation would be rapidly cleared up and Allied resources released, and wewere led to expect the arrival of 5j American divisions in Europe during 1951.

We had not at that time had the evidence, which the Far East situation has now given us, of the willingness of the Communist Powers to takegreater risks of war, and we had not had the Soviet Note of 20th October statingthat the Soviet Government wouid not reconcile itself to measures &quot;directed towards the restoration in Western Germany of a German regular army&quot; or theirsubsequent note of 3rd November inviting us to hold Four-Power discussions on the demilitarisation of Germany.   I had to take account also of the opinionof His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow, who considers that the Russians would regard the re-creation of German armed forces as different in characterfrom and more provocative than any measures taken by the Western Powersthemselves to increase their armed strength.    I felt bound therefore toconsider whether this was indeed a suitable moment in which the take apublic and irrevocable decision to rearm Germany.8. On the other hand it was arguable that the risks involved had always existed, seeing that, even before the reverses in Korea, there was no prospect of an effective force being in existence in Europe in the near future.It could therefore be argued that the risk must in any case be faced and thatthere would be greater risk in showing any sign of hesitation over what was regarded by the Americans as an essential preliminary to the building up of effective Allied defence forces in Europe.   The various considerations were put by myself and the Minister of Defence to the Prime Minister in Washington,in case he should feel able, in the course of his talks with President Truman, toexpress in strict confidence the doubts which I had in mind.   He decidedthat it would be wrong for him to do so in view of the satisfactorydeclarations which he had received from the President regarding theimportance still attached by the United States to the defence of Europe, their intention to nominate General Eisenhower as Supreme Commander as soonas the &quot;Spofford plan&quot; was approved, and their proposal to send NationalGuard reinforcements to Europe.   Any sign on our part of drawing back would,in his view, have been fatal to the Washington talks and to the renewed Anglo-American partnership which seemed to be developing.Probable German reaction9. The second important factor to be considered is what is likelyto be the reaction of the German Government to an approach from the high commissioners for a German contribution on the lines laid down in thereports.   My colleagues will observe from Annex &apos;A&apos; to this paper that theplan provides for two distinct stages in the process of building up a german contribution.   During the first stage, described as the &quot;transitional period&quot;,the Germans would be asked to begin recruiting and training their soldiersto form units under certain clearly defined conditions and restrictions.    Theywould be in a position of definite inequality vis-a-vis the other Powers, in thattheir units would be limited to brigade groups, while the other nationscontributed divisions;   their possession of heavy armour and operational aircraft would be restricted;  there would be controls over officerrecruitment and posting;   German war production would be controlled;   andthere would be a N.A.T.O. High Commissioner whose responsibilities, thoughostensibly applying to all member countries, would obviously be primarily for control of the German forces.   More important from their point of view, theSupreme Commander would be answerable to North Atlantic Treaty Ministerialorgans on which Germany is not represented.10. The second stage would be reached after &quot;permanent mechanisms,either military or political&quot; are developed which can &quot;effectively discharge thevarious responsibilities&quot;;   that is to say, after the French have had anopportunity to work out and obtain acceptance of their plan for a European Army.

It is the French thesis that, if the German units were contributed as partof a European Army under their scheme, the Germans would be on a basisof equality with the other participating Governments,11. The German Chancellor has made it quite clear that he will not beable to accept the conditions of inequality laid down under the Spofford plan for the &quot;transitional period&quot;, and he has expressed the hope that proposals on these lines will not be put formally to him.   Sir I. Kirkpatrick, whosecomments I attach as Annex &apos;B&apos; to this paper, takes the view that, whateverconditions were offered to the Germans, they would certainly argue for aperiod of weeks or months before agreeing to make a contribution, havingregard to the general unwillingness of the Germans to rearm at all and theirnatural desire to make the best bargain they can.   Whether or not theywould be.   more favourably disposed towards the French scheme for a european Army is hard to say.    One thing, however, is clear, namely thatit will be a considerable time before an actual start is made on the recruitment and training of German troops. - It seems to me clear that the French Govern-ment are well aware of this, and there is no reason to suppose that theSoviet Government think differently.12. It seems to result from this that neither a decision on 18thDecember to accept the Spofford plan nor even an approach to the german federal Government thereafter would in fact constitute or appear to constitute the irrevocable moment of action which might be supposed to provoke Soviet counter-action.Attitude of the Americans13. We are all agreed that the first objective of our defence policy must be to secure the early appointment of the Supreme Commander andinitiation of the plans for creating an integrated Atlantic defence force for Europe with the greatest possible American contribution.   Although theprospects in this respect are very much less favourable than they seemedin September, there is still a hope that some American divisions (albeit notexperienced in battle) will be available during 1951.    The United states administration have consistently made it plain that Congress would notsanction reinforcement of Europe by American troops unless the force ofwhich they were to form part was sufficient to have a chance of effective action;   and that they do not believe that such a force can be built up withoutGevman participation.   If therefore we were to show hesitation about approa.ch.iiigthe Germans at this stage, there is no doubt that there would be a reaction inthe United States which might prejudice the first objective of our policy.Indeed, if we were to suggest that our hesitations were based upon fear ofthe Russian reaction, it cannot be excluded that there might be a tendency for the Americans to reverse their basic policy of putting the defence ofEurope first in priority among their objectives.Alternative courses of action14. In the light of the above I am now willing to hold that we cannot afford to suggest any basic doubts or   hesitations about going through with our plans for a German contribution.    On this I think there will be generalagreement.    There is, however, in my view still room for consideration ofthe-timing of the next steps in the programme, and the alternative coursesbefore us appear to me to be three-fold.   I set them out in the following paragraphs with their advantages and disadvantages.

15. The first course is to agree in the North Atlantic Council to an approach being made to the German Federal Government by the three high commissioners, as recommended by the Deputies, on the basis of theSpofford plan.    The advantage of this is that, according to statements madeto the Prime Minister in Washington, the Americans would then be preparedimmediately to announce the appointment of General Eisenhower as supreme commander, without waiting for the German reaction, and we should thus have set in motion the first part of the broad defence plan to which we attach such importance.   We should also have shown to the world and to our allies our determination to press forward regardless of possible risks and despite theevident weakness of the Allied position at the present moment,   the disadvantages relate partly to the Russians and partly to the Germans, but to acertain extent they cancel one another out;    If it is a fact, and I think it is, thatthe Germans will not look at conditions of this kind; at any rate without manyweeks or months of argument, then it will be a long time before any actualrecruitment begins in Germany, and since the Russians are presumably no lessaware than we are of the delays which are sure to ensue and of the conditionswhich the Germans are likely to make, the provocative character of theactual approach to the German Government is likely to be a good deal lessthan might otherwise have been the case.   On the other hand, it is undoubtedlyunfortunate that the Allied Governments should have to go to the GermanGovernment with proposals for a German contribution containing conditionswhich the Ge l mans are sure to turn down, thereby putting the Germans in aposition in which they can bargain with us,    It has always been our view,shared moreover by the United States Government, that we should avoidputting the Germans in this position.   Against this, however, it is arguable that,when the Germans see the Supreme Commander appointed and an effectiveintegrated force beginning to be built up, they will themselves begin to desireto take a share in the defence effort and might, after a month or so of argument,be more willing than at present to accept conditions palatable to the otherGove rnments.164 The second course would be to say to the Americans and to theNorth Atlantic Council that, while we in no way withdraw from the plan itself,we do not consider that the actual approach to the German Federal Governmentshould be made for the moment, but that it should be timed carefully inrelation to the possibility of Four-Power discussions and to the world-widesituation resulting from the events in the Far East.    The dangers of this courseare evident,   If there had not been so much publicity about the whole matter,it might have been possible, and would I think have been desirable, to take this line.   As it is, there would be grave danger of it being misunderstood in Americaand on the Continent and the whole momentum, such as it is, of the AtlanticPowers towards the building up of effective defences might be lost.   almost certainly the Supreme Commander would not be appointed and there would be afurther period of uncertainty, during which the attitude of the Germans woldcontinue to deteriorate.    The advantages would be that we should be better able touse the prospect of German rearmament as a bargaining factor in any talks withthe Soviet Government and we should presumably avoid such risk of provokingan early attack in Europe as might arise from the alternative course.17, Between these two alternatives there appears to me to lie a thirdcourse which would consist in seeking to secure some delay in the formalapproach to the German Federal Government without however putting the americans off the immediate appointment of a Supreme Commander.   It maynot be possible to achieve this, and in that event we could fall back tocourse one, but the basis on which I would make the attempt in discussions with Mr. Acheson and my other colleagues would be as follows:-

(a) First, the declaration by Dr. Adenauer to the InternationalNews Correspondent on 11th December, when he is quotedas having said:-&quot;I do not wish to interfere with the negotiations between the Atlantic Pact Powers.   I only want toprevent the present plan for the incorporation ofGerman combat teams being formally put beforethe Federal Government.    If this should happen,we would find ourselves in the unfortunate positionof having to reject it. &quot;This statement is bound to be considered by the north atlantic Council and it may well be that Mr. Acheson himselfwill raise the question of its effect on the timing and thecharacter (i. e. whether formal or informal) of any approach to Dr. Adenauer by the three High Commissioners.(b) I could point out that as I consistently maintained at the meetings in New York, it would be fatal to go to the Germans cap in handwith a request for their contribution, thereby putting themin a position where they could bargain with us;  but that as andwhen the integrated Atlantic force in Europe began to be built up and show evidence of strength, the Germans would become increasingly anxious to play their part.   I might quote my statement at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council at new York on 15th September, when I said:-&quot;We must first be strong ourselves and then wecould invite Germany to join us.....It would be fatal to admit that Europe could not defend itselfwithout German assistance. &quot;From this I could argue that the orfe fatal thing would be togive the Germans the impression that all further progress with the Atlantic defence force is dependent upon their acceptance of a German contribution;   and that consequently the essential preliminary to any discussions with the Germansis the appointment of General Eisenhower, which initself would be bound to affect favourably the whole atmosphere ofdefence preparations in Europe, including Germany.(c) In the light of these considerations I would urge that, beforethe proposals were put to the German Federal Governmentin a formal manner, the High Commissioners should holdinformal and private discussions with Dr. Adenauer in orderto ascertain his views..E.

annex aGERMAN PARTICIPATION IN THE DEFENCE OF EUROPESummary of the conclusions of theNorth Atlantic Military Committeeand the North Atlantic Council Deputies(1)    The defence of Europe,  including &quot;Western germany as far as to the East as possible, will require a german contribution.(2)    A European defence force is militarily acceptable,but its achievement should, under no circumstances, delay the contribution of Germany to the defence of Europe.(3)   Note is taken of the French Government&apos;s intentionto call a conference of the countries (including the german federal Republic) which may wish to participate in a european Army.(If.)   While work proceeds towards the solution of thepolitical aspects of the problem, however,  certain steps,upon which there already exists a large measure of agreement,can and must be taken immediately.    For this purpose theremust be a transitional period to permit;-(i)   The essential preliminary work on the military organisation to be initiated immediately;(ii)   The recruitment of German man-power,  theformation of combat-worthy German units andthe production of material under provisionalarrangements pending development of a more permanent system;    and(iii)   The consideration of the broader political problems to he undertaken concurrently butfree from&apos; the pressure attendant upon the initiation of military measures.These provisional arrangements would be progressivelysuperseded or modified as and to the extent that permanentmechanisms, either military or &quot;(political, were developedwhich could effectively discharge the various responsibilities.(5)   The Military Committee and the Deputies  therefore recommend that the Occupying Powers be invited by the partiesto the North Atlantic Treaty to discuss with the German federal government the question of German participation in the defenceof Western Europe on the following basiss-(i)    It would not serve the best interests of Europe,or of Germany,  to bring into being a Germannational army or German General Staff.(ii)    Any system of German -participation must be withinthe N.A.T.O.   structure and any German formationsmust be under the authority of the supreme commander.(iii)    The question, whether German formations should be recruited by conscription or on a voluntary basis should be determined by the occupying powers, after consultation with the german authorities.

2 s) i)(iv)    Subject to the limitations set out below, Germanunits should be  treated on a basis of fullequality with&apos; units of other participating countries with which they are integrated,(v)    The only militarily practicable short termcontribution by Germany would be in the formof complete German formations.(vi)    As regards the land forces,  the size of suchGerman formations should not, under presentconditions, exceed that of Regimental CombatTeams or Brigade Groups.    However, when theseRegimental Combat Teams or Brigade Groups are formed and trained, the question of the mannerin which they should be used must be determined in the light of conditions at the time, dueweight being given to the views of the supreme commander.(vii)    German forces should not be developed to the detriment of other Allied forces, nor should they be permitted to develop at a rate or toa degree that would constitute a threat to allied security.    To this end,  the number ofGerman land formations should at no timeexceed one-fifth of the total number of like-Allied land formations allocated, to and ear-marked for SHAPE.(viii)    Germany should not be allowed to contributecomplete heavy armoured formations.    This,however,  should not preclude the inclusionof the necessary armour to complete the landformations authorised,(ix)   The German contribution should include completeair units for the defence of Western Germanyand the support of German ground units.    Suchair units would be a part of the integratedair forces under the Supreme Commander. .(x)    The German contribution in naval forces shouldbe limited to the manning and operating of mine-craft, patrol-craft and harbour defencecraft.(xi)    The rotation of individuals from the regular forces to any reserve should be controlledso as to ensure that no unforeseen orundesired expansion of German forces ispossible at any time.(xii)    The Occupying Powers.should retain supervision of officer recruitment and should rely, inso far as practicable, upon recruitment andtraining of new officers.    Similarly, super-vision should be exercised over the trainingof Non-c commision s i one d 0 office r s.

(xiii)    German officers should he commissioned as required for German units,  and some shouldalso he gradually integrated into selectedposts on the  international staff of theSupreme Commander and his major subordinateCommands when German units are assigned.Determination of the extent of the contribution from the German Officer Corpsto the integrated staff should await therecommendations of the Supreme Commander.(xiv)    German forces cannot constitute a militarythreat unless they possess their own sources of essential war material.    Therefore, it isconsidered that there should remainprohibited and limited industries in Germany.Germany should not be permitted to produceheavy military equipment, military aircraft,or naval vessels other than minor defensivecraft.(xv)    The manufacture of atomic, biological and chemical weapons, and long range missiles,should not be permitted to Germany.(xvi)    Research and development should be limitedto requirements laid down by the military committee, and supervision and control should bo exercised by the appropriateN.A.T. 0.   agency.(xvii)    Subject to the above safeguards Germanproduction should contribute to the greatest-extent possible to the support of the german contribution in man-power, and to such otherphases of the common defence as may be reasonable and within her capabilities.    Thenature and size of the  contribution to bemade by the German armament industry shouldbe recommended by the appropriate agencies of i\. h.    0.    Until other arrangements are adopted the safeguards on production willcontinue to be exercised by the occupyingauthorities.    There must,  of course, be close co-operation between them and theDefence Production Board of the N.A.T. 0.(xviii) . Detaile1 plans for the raising and preliminarytraining of German forces should be made bythe occupying authorities in concert withthe Supreme Commander and the appropriateGerman authorities.(xix)    The administration of the German defence effort should be entrusted to a Germanagency,  or agencies.    Such agency,  oragencies, should be of a civilian character and should remain subject to some system ofAllied control,  even should the regime ofOccupation be modified.    During the initial period control will continue to be exercised by the Occupying Powers.    A finaldetermination of the form, and functions ofthe German agency must be made inconjunction with the German authorities.

&amp; si i(xx)    Any German administration established for thispurpose should be capable of fulfilling its functions effectively and rapidly.    its functions should not be such as to permit the development of a Defence Ministry.    Toensure against the possible rebirth of aGerman General Staff,  the functions appropriate to the plans,  operations and intelligencesections of military staffs, above the levelof authorised tactical units,  should only be discharged by international staffs under theSupreme Commander and should not be permitted in any German agency.(xxi)   The enforcement of the safeguards set forth alsoveshould be the responsibility of the occupying powers.    The enforcement of those safeguardscould be progressively transferred to theappropriate European or N./4.T.O.  agency if,  andto the extent that this should later bec ons ide re d a dvis ab1e.(6)    The Occupying Powers should be invited to keep theother parties to the North Atlantic Treaty informed as fully as possible of the course of the discussions with the german authorities and the steps taken to initiate german participation.(7)    The Deputies should continue to study the proposalfor a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation High Commissioner,with responsibilities with regard to both the German andother national contributions to the  integrated force.(8)    The appointment of a Supreme Commander at theearliest possible date is a matter of the greatest importance.-k-

&apos;t, v0 0&apos; ANNEX    BGERMAN OPINION ON GERMAN participation in WESTERN DEFENCEPublic1 .      The idea of German participation in Western european defence is repugnant to large sections of public opinionon various grounds.      There are the defeatists who would likeGermany to remain neutral;      Niemoller is their prophet.There are those who would like to exploit the Western Powers&apos;need of Germany to extort concessions.      There are those whofeel that Germany having lost the two wars would be ill-advised to fight again until she is sure of being on thewinning side.     This element is without principle and wouldlike to wait before deciding whether to join the West orthe East.      There is a small element which believes thatGermany&apos;s future lies in collaboration with the East.    Finallythere are large numbers of Germans who sincerely believe thatany form of remilitarisation will bring back to power themilitary caste and so destroy the present German politicalstructure.2.     Two classes are particularly opposed to re-armament.First the workers who object to the return to power of themilitary in any form.      Secondly the students at the universities.      It is noteworthy that in Berlin where thespirit of resistance to Russia is strongest only 6 per cent of the students of Berlin University voted in a recent pollin favour of the constitution of a German Federal Army..16 per cent voted against German participation under anyconditions.      37 per cent would have been prepared to seeGermany participate in a European Federal Army and 23 per cent would have agreed to a German contribution but only under conditions of complete political and military equality.      inthe Western Zone of Germany the students are more opposed to participation.      Thus in a recent poll at GbttingenUniversity 67 per cent voted against German participationunder any conditions.The Political. Parties3.      Dr. Schumacher and the Sozialistische PartieDeutschland (S.P.D.) have taken advantage of the present state of public opinion to wage a violent and successfulcampaign against German participation.      The result has been considerable 3.P.D. gains in the recent elections in thestates of Hesse, Wuerttcmberg-Baden and Bavaria.h.      Dr. Adenauer&apos;s coalition parties have been unable to counter Dr. Schumacher&apos;s propaganda because the western powers have not yet made a concrete offer to Germany andthere has therefore been no solid basis for any counterpropaganda.      Nevertheless it may be said that the coalitionparties, impressed by the general opposition to re-armament and by the success of Dr.  Schumacher&apos;s campaign, are resolvednot. to allow the Chancellor to agree to any german contribution except on terms of equality.      The Chancellor

2 ti 3himself is in advance -of his ov/n party hut he realises thathis political position is at stake and has authorised theissue of an official statement to the effect that Germany -can only pariticipate- if she is given a position of equalitynot only in a possible eventual European Army hut also inany interim period.      He has also said that it -will be extremely difficult to secure parliamentary approval for aGorman contribution unless the Western Allies agree inprinciple to replace the Occupation Statute and theOccupation Regime by a Security Treaty and the grant of sovereignty to the Federal Republic.The attitude of tho Federal Republic to the Spofford Plan5.      In the circumstances described above it is certain thatthe Chancellors  the coalition parties, the German parliament and public opinion will be united in declaring the SpoffordPlan to be unacceptable.      Although the plan states inparagraph 5(d) that subject to limitations set out in theMilitary Committee&apos;s Report German units shall be treatedon a basis of full equality with other participating countries, tho plan provides for an interim period in which german man-power would bo recruited and will bo treatedmanifestly on a basis of inequality.     Thus whilst the other powers maintain divisions, tho siso of the German formationswill be restricted to regimental combat teams or brigadegroups.      Tho Gorman Government will be subjected to controlsand restrictions not imposed on any other participatingpower.      Finally the Supreme Commander will be under aCommittee of Ministers on which Germany will not berepresented.      Consequently the German Government,althoughcontributing a contingent, will have no say in the formulation of tho directives to the Supreme Commander and will be in aless favourable position in this respect than Atlantic treaty powers who make no contribution to the integrated force.    Ifthe proposal for a N.A.T.O. Commissioner is adopted theinferior position of Germany will be accentuated.6.      If it is desired to secure a German contribution to an integrated force on the basis of the Spofford Report, this can only be done by long and complicated negotiations-withthe German Government.
