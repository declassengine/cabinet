(50) 27511 th November, 1950CABINETFIRST REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ADMINISTRATIONOF JUSTICE UNDER THE NAVAL DISCIPLINE ACT(PILCHER COMMITTEE)Memorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty the First Report of this Committee, dealing with the Court Martial aspects ofNaval discipline, was received in the Admiralty in February, 1950. During the succeeding months its recommendations were examined by the Admiralty, in con-junction with the other Service Departments who were concerned in some of themand with the Naval authorities in certain of the Commonwealth countries whoseNaval disciplinary code is closely connected with that of the Royal Navy. At theend of July, the Lord Chancellor and the Minister of Defence circulated the Reportto the Cabinet under cover of a Memorandum (CP. (50) 180) outlining theconclusions which had been reached on certain important issues arising from it andfrom the earlier report of the Committee on Army and Air Force Courts Martial(Lewis Committee). The Cabinet reached a decision on the question of AppealsCourt machinery and deferred decision on other matters.2. I took no steps to publish the Pilcher Report at this time, principallybecause this would have stimulated pressure for a declaration of Governmentintentions on the two Reports. However, enquiries are being made about its publi-cation, both in the House of Lords and the House of Commons, The matter hasbeen considered by the Service Ministers and the Minister of Defence and I now propose, with their concurrence, that the Report should be published immediately,without any declaration of the conclusions reached by the Admiralty or of theGovernments intentions in the field of the Disciplinary Codes of the three Services.H.Admiralty, S.W. 1,17th November, 1950.339663
