DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 305 COPY NO.   32STH DECEMBER, 1950CABINETILLEGAL STRIKES AND S.R.   Ik O. NO. 1305/40Memorandum by the Attorney GeneraliVlay I again draw attention to my paper on this subject datedthe 28th June, 1950 (CP. (50) 143) and its application to two recentstrikes.   In that paper I set out the respective responsibilities of theCabinet and of the Attorney-General, and I refer to the generalConstitutional position as set out in the third paragraph of that paper.2.     Strike at B. O. A. C.This strike, which concerned the employment of two non-unionists, was unofficial, and was instigated by three individuals whoare either notorious trouble-makers or Communists, has now beenterminated.    For this and one other reason I have decided not now to prosecute, but I should make clear my reasons:(i) The strike was one clearly affecting the public interest.Important transport services were involved;   heavy loss was caused and British prestige was affected.    The evidence asto its instigation was clear and I was advised by theDirector of Public Prosecutions that the case was perhaps the neatest example of an obviously illegal strike whichwe have had to consider.    Clearly in the ordinary course should have had no alternative but to prosecute.(ii) The fact that a strike has been terminated, while always a factor to be taken into account, is by no means a conclusivereason for not prosecuting especially if strikers, byillegal action, have gained their ends. .(iii) The fact that, as in this case, the strike concerned theemployment of non-unionists and would thus attract the sympathy of the Labour movement, as indeed it does my own,is I am afraid exactly one of those political considerations which I have as far as I can to exclude from consideration.It may be that opponents of the Labour movement regard sucha strike as tyrannical and the Attorney-General, in his legalcapacity, cannot affect his legal and quasi judicial action byhis personal or political view of the merits on such a point.(iv) I have, however, been greatly impressed by the Minister ofLabour&apos;s statement that if the strike had been formallyreported to him, he would not have referred it to arbitration and it would, therefore, after a lapse of time have becomelegal;   it was no doubt on this ground that the Minister firststated that the strike was not illegal although he subsequently

corrected this statement.   I certainly think it would be wrong to prosecute for illegal striking those who, because of theadministrative views of the Ministry of Labour, are denied theopportunity of arbitration.    The only justification for makingstrikes illegal is that the better method of settlement providedby arbitration is available.(v)  Accordingly, for the reason mentioned in the last paragraph,and in view of the fact that the strike has concluded, I shallnot now prosecute in this case.   As, however, attention hasalready been drawn in the press to my neglect to prosecute,I feel that in fairness to my office I should, in answer to anarranged Parliamentary Question, state my reasons for thisdecision as indicated above.3.     Strike at Duple Motor Bodies, Ltd.(i)   I understand that the Minister of Labour is submitting a memorandumabout this strike.   As I am informed, it started several weeks ago on the ground that the employers were dismissing certainworkers for redundancy.   In the result 800 men struck workbecause 400 were to be dismissed, a result most beneficialat present to the employers.   The fatuity of this action or thefact that it was an official strike was not, however, a ground for not prosecuting.   Nor, of course, is the fact that notwithstanding a reference to arbitration by the Minister, thestrike still continues.   I have up to now refrained from takingproceedings because the public interest did not appear greatlyinvolved and no important production was being lost.(ii)   The matter has assumed a different complexion, however, as aresult of allegations in a Parliamentary Question put by private notice on Tuesday by Mr. Lionel Heald, K. C. , to theeffect that the Works Committee at Park Royal Vehicles Ltd.were inducing employees of that firm to contribute towards a fixed levy for assisting the strikers at Duple&apos;s and were doing this by methods of intimidation and improper pressure.As far as the police have at present ascertained,these allegations appear well founded although not easy of proof.(iii)  Assuming satisfactory evidence is obtained it would seem that those concerned at the Park Royal Works are guilty of aiding andabetting the illegal strike at Duple&apos;s and probably also ofintimidation.   I could hardly prosecute for these offences withoutalso prosecuting the Union and other leaders at Duple&apos;s forcounselling and procuring the illegal strike there.(iv)   I should be glad to know if my colleagues are aware of anyconsiderations affecting public policy to which I should haveregard in deciding whether or not to prosecute.4. I must now remind my colleagues of certain general considerations:-(i)   It was recently stated in Parliament by the Prime Minister that although the Minister of Labour had a concurrent authority with me of initiating a prosecution, it had become the practicethat the matter should be left to me.   I was not consulted asto this transfer of responsibility but the transfer having beenmade, I accept it.    i am sure that the object of the transfer wasnot to shift a disagreeable and difficult responsibility to the attorney-General but to ensure the due and detachedenforcement of the law.

(ii)   It is, however, difficult for me to prosecute in these cases ifOrder No. 1305 is not administered expeditiously andin such a way that the remedy of arbitration is available as the alternative to strike action.(iii)   In this connection, I draw attention to the grave criticisms of order No. 1305 in leading articles in the Times and manchester Guardian respectively on 7th and 6th December.One of these states, whether correctly or not I do not know,that on a previous occasion a dispute as to the employmentof non-unionists was dealt with under the Order.   I shall want to be sure about this before basing myself on this ground in the B. O. A. C. case.(iv)   Many of these strikes are, I have little doubt, the result ofdilatory and otherwise unsatisfactory procedures in theUnions, but over these the Government have no direct control.    If, however, the procedure for industrial settlementswas more efficacious, the difficulties arising underOrder No. 1305 would be greatly mitigated.(v)  Prosecutions under Order No. 1305 are undoubtedly and naturallyunpopular.    Those detrimentally affected by the provisionsof the law rarely do give their ungrudging approbation to those provisions.    I have myself received a very large number of letters from trade union branches attacking me personallyin very violent and (to me) painful terms.    But while the lawremains as it is, I must, in cases affecting the public interest,carry out my duty of enforcing it.   It is for the Cabinet todecide whether the law should be maintained in its present state but I cannot conceal from my colleagues that while on the one hand special-powers for dealing with actioninterfering with essential supplies and services during thepresent grave situation are denied and on the other handprosecutions under Order No. 1305 are deprecated, theposition has its difficulties.1(vi)   It might be possible to do away with the criminal sanctionsunder Order No. 1305 if, as a matter of course, the practicewas established of employers bringing civil actions for damages in the County Courts.    But while the criminalsanction exists I must not ignore it.   And although wherecivil actions are actually started with reasonablepromptitude that would be a factor to which I would haveregard, I could not long delay action in the hope that theymight be.   Indeed the general principle of the law is that ifcivil proceedings disclose a criminal offence, the courtsmay and, in some cases, must, stay the civil proceedingsuntil criminal proceedings have been taken.H.
