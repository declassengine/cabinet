(50) 322 V!KfMSQ^i0^i ir*!rirfiopCABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATY: INDIVIDUAL CLAIMSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe imposition upon Japan under a Peace Treaty of an obligation to com-compensate individual nationals of United Nations countries for loss or damage to property and for personal injury and ill-treatment suffered at Japanese hands duringthe war raises some ditncuit issues and I have thought it desirable to deal with this aspect of the Japanese Peace Treaty separately from other aspects of that Treaty.2. The issue does not concern reparations, but is liimted to &quot; individualclaims.&quot;3. I attach as annex a paper agreed on 7th December, 1950, by the Far East(Official) Committee outlining the history of this problem, defining the claims, and stating the arguments for and against the imposition on Japan of an obligation topay these claims.4. The justice of these claims cannot be denied. The various. Peace Treatiesbetween His Majesty&apos;s Government and Italy, Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria and finland (apart from obligations in respect of reparations) impose an obligation topay individual claims in respect of losses sustained within the territories of theseex-enemy countries. Siam has made similar payments, though this is not exactly a precedent. The United States Government have paid compensation for personalclaims partly from funds provided by the sale of Japanese assets in the UnitedStates and partly from the premia paid under their compulsory war damage insur-ance scheme, which related to property in the United States and against which thereproved in the event to be no claims.5. On the other hand, the great majority of property claims against Japan arein respect, not of loss and damage sustained inside Japan, but in Allied territories.The same is also true of claims in respect of personal injury, ill-treatment and death.It is probably academic to expect that we shall be able to obtain further reparationsfrom Japanese industrial assets. The main source of reparations now remainingwill consist of about  60 million worth of monetary goldv which will have to be shared between some thirteen of the forty-nine States at war with Japan. In theUnited Kingdom, Japanese assets are valued at about one to one and a quartermillion pounds sterling, and it is unlikely that His Majesty&apos;s Government will beable to secure any substantial sums from Japanese overseas assets in neutral, enemy or ex-enemy countries. Japan would certainly be expected to pay compensation in foreign exchange, and the insertion of a clause in the Peace Treaty requiring her to pay individual claims would open the way for other countries (including China)to put forward astronomical claims which could not possibly be met. Finally,, there is the general consideration that it is undesirable to include in a Peace Treatya clause which clearly cannot be enforced. &apos;United States View . 3       &apos;6. The United States have proposed a general waiving of war claims with theexception that Allied Powers would retain Japanese property within their territory and Japan would restore Allied property in Japan or compensate therefor.39818
Public Opinion in the United kingdom. Although oil &quot;a realistic view if^aid^)K^i^^^.^Qt that any obliga-tion imposed on Japan in this respect could be met, it must be recognised that theabsence of any attempt to impose such an obligation would give rise to misinter-pretation and criticism in this country.^ , ,(i8. In the final paragraph of the attached paper, the Far East (Official)Committee suggests that it may in the end be impossible to avoid a waiver in-thePeace Treaty of all war claims as distinct from pre-warclaims; arising in respectof private property outside Japan and of personal claims arising from injury aridill-treatment. I foresee that this may well prove to be the case and that if theseindividual claimants are to receive compensation there will have to be assistancefrom His Majesty&apos;s Treasury. I have already caused enquiries to be made on thispoint to ascertain how large a financial commitment would be involved.9. In the meantime, I invite my colleagues to agree in principle that we shouldnot press for the inclusion in the Peace Treaty of an obligation on Japan to pay,in addition to reparations, individual claims for loss of and damage to propertysituated outside Japan and for personal injury and ill-treatment wherever suffered.&apos; ;   E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,20th December, 1950.ANNEXJAPANESE PEACE TREATYClaims for Restitution and Restoration of Property and Compensation for loss of Property and Personal PrejudiceSummaryThis question was last considered in detail in 1947, when the Overseas Recon-struction Committee on 29th July considered two papers, O.R.C. (47) 34 andO.R.C. (47) 36. The former of these two papers, constituting a brief on the financialand economic provisions of the Peace Treaty with Japan for the Canberra Con-ference, recommended in Section VI that all loot should be restored, that theproperty of Allied nationals in Japan should likewise be restituted and that com-pensation should be paid for loss of value; in Section IX it was recommended thatoccupation costs should be a charge on the Japanese Government. O.R.C. (47) 36discussed the desirability of an obligation being imposed upon the Japanese Govern-ment in the Peace Treaty to pay compensation for loss of or damage to property-belonging to, and personal injury suffered by, individual nationals of the united nations at Japanese hands during the war, but made no definite recommendation.The Committee approved O.R.C. (47) 34, and with regard to O.R.C. (47) 36 decidedthat the United Kingdom delegation to the Canberra Conference should support aproposal that an obligation should be imposed upon Japan by the Peace Treaty topay compensation in respect of claims by individuals.2. It has now become clear that Japan will be in a position to pay even lessby way of reparations than was considered possible in 1947, and the United StatesGovernment haye now proposed that all parties to the Treaty should waive claims against Japan arising out of war acts prior to 2nd September, 1945, except that(a) the Allied Powers would in general retain Japanese property Within their territory and (b) Japan would restore Allied property, or, if not restorable intact,,provide yen to compensate for an agreed percentage of lost value. This wouldmean that the Japanese Government would pay: nothing as compensation for the wide-spread damage to property belonging to British subjects in China, british colonial territories in the Far East and Burma and nothing: to compensate forill-treatment and injury to persons; &apos;    &apos;

The claims discussed in the following paragraph of this paper do nof include those; in respect of Japairs pre-war debts of pre-war claims Jagairist- Japans; Theclaims considered below fall into the following classes: - &quot;. . -1   ?(a) All claims in respect of damage to or loss of property (1) in Japan, (2) out-side Japan ie.g., in. China and British Colonial territories in Asia, &amp;c).(b) Personal claims in respect of death, injury or ill-treatment (1) from civilians,. - (2) from prispners-of-war arising both in Japan and in the territories;/     overrun by the Japanese during World War II.5. In the first paragraph of O.R.C. (47) 36. the Far East (Official) Committeestated as follows:  &quot; There is a very great number of claims by British subjects under this head,and compensation would amount to a considerable sum, arid might involvecontinuing payments (pensions, &amp;c), in foreign exchange. It is known that theAustralian Government intend to put in a substantial claim against the JapaneseGovernment under this head for personal claims arising out of Japanese treat-ment of Australian prisoners-of-war (on the Burma-Siam railway). BritishCommonwealth claims will therefore be in total very large, and there is evidencethat there will be considerable pressure on His Majesty&apos;s Government to writeinto the Japanese Peace Treaty an obligation to compensate them. Nevertheless,large as British claims may be, Chinese claims will certainly be much larger.&quot;6. Statements of claims already registered on a voluntary basis by Britishsubjects for property losses sustained at Japanese hands may amount to  28 million(including  26 millions&apos; worth in respect of property lost or damaged in China).The War Office stated in 1947 that it did not know how large compensation claims would be for ill-treatment on the Burma-Siam railway. Then, only one claim hadbeen made, and the sum named was  3,000. There were over 31,000 british prisoners-of-war who survived Japanese imprisonment. The International MilitaryWar Crimes Tribunal in Tokyo estimated in 1948 that the overall death rate ofAllied prisoners in Japanese hands during the war was twenty-seven per cent.Total claims received by the War Office in 1947 from 12,500 officers and men for loss of personal effects and cash when prisoners-of-war in Japanese hands amountedto  2,700,000. At that time  350,000 had been paid in respect of such claims, butthere was no authority to pay more. There were no comprehensive estimates of claims arising from Colonial territories at that time, but it is now estimated thatthey amount to approximately  1,000 million.The Case for requiring the Japanese Government to Pay Claims7. It is clear that political pressure may be exerted on Ministers,fromclaimants in this; country to make some payment in respect of certain categories of individual claims for damage or loss of property and personal injury and ill-treatment not covered by existing compensation schemes. It might also be argued that a waiver of claims in the Japanese Peace Treaty would create an undesirableprecedent for a peace treaty with Germany.8, His ;Majesty&apos;s Government have recorded statements on a voluntary basisfrom British subjects in respect of loss of and damage to property and for personal injury and ill-treatment as a result of Japanese action, but have publicly acceptedno obligation either to pay such claims or to take any action; to exact payment fromthe Japanese Government. &apos; &apos;9.   In the case of claims for damage to private property resulting fronThostilities with Germany, Unanimous Resolution No. 3 of the Final Act of the paris Conference on Reparation (Command Paper 6721) provided that the powers at war with Germany would grant each other&apos;s nationals reciprocal treatment in
the payment of compensation. No such declaration has, however, yet been agreed by the Powers at warvwith Japan.;.     ;f-^r^ ? v^::-*(Note.-The Chinese Government (Nationalist) declared in 1947 that they,&apos;   did.not intend to compensate foreigners who had/suffered loss in China,v       as they considered the Japanese responsible.   The Philippine Goyern-ment has not accorded full national treatment to foreigners, whose property in the Philippines was damaged in the war.)The. Case against requiring the Japanese Government to Pay Claims M;10. The American proposal for a waiver of claims^ which was handed byMr. John Foster Dulles to Sir Esler Dening on 22nd September, 1950, related toall claims against Japan and read as follows: -&quot;All parties would waive claims arising out of war acts prior to2nd September, 1945, except that:  (a) The Allied Powers would in general hold Japanese property within;       their territory; and(b) Japan would restore Allied property or, if not restorable intact, provide&apos; yen to compensate for an agreed percentage of lost value.&quot;(Note. It is assumed that (b) above refers only to property situated in Japan,-   although this has not been confirmed.)11. In support of this proposal the United States Government are likely to advance two arguments:  (i) The United States Government has been paying a large sum every year^     since the Japanese surrender on 2nd September, 1945, varying from$250 million to $500 million a year, to keep the Japanese economy going.JapanV financial position remains unsound and there is as yet no evidence that Japan is within sight of achieving a viable economy anda satisfactory balance of payments position. The United States Govern-&quot; merit will therefore contend with some justification that since they (and indeed the other Allied Powers) cannot afford to see Japan go bankruptany obligation imposed upon the Japanese Government by the peace treaty to pay compensation in foreign exchange in respect of individualclaims for personal injury and ill-treatment and property damagearising out of the war will amount to a direct charge on the United Statestaxpayer.(ii) The United States Government are also likely to say that, if, as theycontend, Japan is in no position to pay anything but token reparations tothe Allies, she certainly cannot meet claims of the magnitude mentionedin paragraph 6 above.12.. It is submitted that the United States case, if it is argued as suggested above, may prove very difficult to resist. Further, many claims of claimants in theUnited Kingdom are already covered by existing schemes-pension, and chattelsschemes, &amp;c. but the number of claimants not so covered in this country isunknown. The majority of those not covered by these schemes are British subjectsresident abroad though of them some at any rate may be covered by the schemes of colonial Governments. Again, the payment of compensation to Allied prisoners-of-war might be regarded as discrimination in their favour as compared with personstaken prisoner by Germany and other ex-enemy countries, and might lead to com-plaints on that score; Lastly, it could be argued with some force that to impose an obligation on the Japanese Government in a peace treaty on which they appear very likely to default would be unwise. -,. :     .;,:    w-m Ki,13.&quot; In the circumstances the Far East (Official) Committee feel that it may eventually prove impossible to resist the United States proposal set out in paragraph10 above, namely, a waiver in the Peace Treaty&apos;of all claims in respect of private property arising outside Japan, and all personal claims arising from injury andill-treatment.
