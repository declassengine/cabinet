THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTYS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 3036th December, 1950CABINETPREVENTION OF CORRUPTION  .Memorandum by the Attorney-general  refer to my previous memoranda on this subject (CP. (49) 78 and CP (50)263). The last paper was considered at Cabinet on 23rd November (CM. (50)77th Conclusions, Minute 8) and the discussion was adjourned for want of time.It appeared that legislation on the lines suggested would not command the general support of the Cabinet. In these circumstances it would hardly be profitable toask that the time of my colleagues should be occupied by further discussion of thematter. It is for the Cabinet and not for me to decide what legislation is desirable in order to maintain proper standards of honesty in this country, and the purposeof this paper is merely to leave clearly on record what recommendations in thatregard I have made.2. I did not suggest the creation of any fresh offences, nor the applicationto public servants of any principle of evidence not previously applicable to them.My proposal was that where money had been offered or given to a public servantby one seeking to do business with his employer, that fact should give rise to a prima facie presumption of corruption to be rebutted by the giver or the receiver,the prosecution failing if at the end of the day there was any reasonable doubt.3. That principle has operated in protection of public servants and, so faras I can ascertain, without any criticism for thirty-four years in relation to contrac-tual transactions. It is an accident that it does not apply to licences which certainpublic bodies now have a statutory power to grant No one has suggested anyprinciple on which a distinction can be drawn between a licence and a contractin such a matter. It is also an accident that the rule does not apply to the B.B.C.and perhaps to one out of the various nationalised industries. I see no reason forthis distinction.4. When the proposal was first put forward it was rejected on the groundthat following so soon after the report of the Lynskey Tribunal it might suggestmore widespread corruption than that Tribunal had revealed. It is now arguedagainst the proposal that the long interval which has now passed since the LynskeyTribunal report would suggest that fresh cases of corruption had led to the necessityfor legislation.  I draw attention to the facts without commenting upon them.5. I have been asked for statistics which are in this nature unobtainable with-out detailed public enquiry through the Chief Constables. I can only point outthat all those who share my responsibility for the administration of the criminal law in England are concerned at the amount of corruption in public life and supported the proposal as originally put forward, namely, the Lord Chancellor,the Home Secretary, the English Law Officers, the Director of Public Prosecutionsand the Lord Chief Justice. Since those who are not concerned with the adminis-tration of the criminal law feel on political grounds that these proposals for itsbetter enforcement should be rejected I can only accept their decision, havingdischarged my own duty as the Governments Chief Legal Adviser by calling attention to the point.H. W. S.Royal Courts of Justice,6th December, 1950.39740
