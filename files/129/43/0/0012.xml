el 4THIS   DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1950SECRETCP. (50) 2624th November, 1950CABINETMARKETING OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLESMemorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning1. This is an interim report from the Committee on Distribution and marketing which was appointed by the Prime Minister on 1st April, 1950, under my chairmanship, to consider what steps might be taken, by legislation or otherwise,to simplify marketing and distribution and so to reduce the general level of retail prices of food and other essential consumer goods.2. We have examined, at some length, the main branches of the subject and set in train a number of detailed investigations: and we hope to be able soon tomake further proposals. Meanwhile, we seek Cabinet endorsement, in principle, ofa scheme to set up a number of public wholesale auctions for fruit and vegetables,on an experimental basis, under a public company financed by the Exchequer.We do not suggest that the auctions should be established forthwith; but,before the scheme can be put into practical shape and legislation drafted, muchdetailed work will have to be done, involving public disclosure of the outline of theGovernment^ plan in the course of consultation with interested parties. We,therefore, seek Cabinet approval at this stage.3. Dissatisfaction with the marketing and distribution of fruit and vegetablesis of long standing. The Linlithgow Committee investigated the subject as long ago as 1923 (Cmd. 1892) and there have been several later committees of enquiry.More recently, the Ministers of Food and Agriculture and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland set up a Fruit and Vegetables Organisation in 1947: and we found the two reports, produced by this Organisation, of great value in our examinationof the subject.4. The Committee have reached the conclusion that, while the completepublic ownership of wholesale fruit and vegetable distribution presents certainattractions, the balance of argument is against this policy. If desired, my colleagues and I will be prepared to explain orally the reasons which have led us to this conclusion.5. An alternative suggestion which we examined, but rejected, was thebuilding of a chain of wholesale auction centres throughout the country, through which growers would be compelled to sell their produce. We see little chance that a scheme on these lines could be successfully launched in the face of strong opposition which it would be certain to provoke from many growers, and from many wholesalers who would be put out of business.6. We have, however, been attracted by a proposal, which was outlined inthe second report,of the Fruit and Vegetables Organisation, under which a numberof wholesale auctions would be established to operate in competition with theexisting wholesale trade. The essence of the scheme is that growers would bring their produce to the public auctions and that retailers would buy direct or through a single intermediary. The growers would expect to receive a rather better pricethan from the present wholesale merchants, but the saving would lie in the cuttingout of many of the intermediaries through whom fruit and vegetables now passbefore they reach the retailer.  This scheme, therefore, holds out the possibility39589
of benefiting both the grower and the housewife, at the expense of unnecessarymiddlemen, and this has always been our Party&apos;s declared purpose. But there are,of course, certain unknown factors which render it advisable to make a cautiousstart. To what extent retailers will attend the auctions and to what extent theywill be dependent on wholesalers who attend in their place is difficult to say. Theattitude of growers, importers and retailers cannot accurately be predicted, northe strength of the opposition from wholesalers and commission agents.7. We instructed a working party of officers of the Departments primarily concerned to work out a detailed scheme, and their report has assisted us in framingour present proposals.8. The scheme should be started on an experimental basis by setting up a fewpublic auctions, in carefully selected centres mainly in areas where the existing arrangements for the wholesale distribution of fruit and vegetables are particularlyunsatisfactory. These areas should present different features, so that variedexperience can be gained. The working party suggested five auction centres, andafter outlining the conditions in a number of areas, tentatively suggested Coventry,Hull, Hanley/Stoke, Reading/Slough or Northamptonshire, and Swansea. some members of rny Committee thought that at the start not more than three auctionsshould be set up, to emphasise the experimental character of this venture in com-petitive socialisation, while others favoured ten or fifteen. The exact number and location of the auctions need not, of course, be settled now and the final decision should be taken after receiving the advice of the body established to run theauctions.9. The facilities afforded by the auction centres must be such as will attractfrom the growers and importers sufficient supplies of home-grown and importedfruit and vegetables for disposal and will secure the daily attendance at the auctionsof a substantial proportion of the greengrocers from the area served by eachauction. The facilities should include a market intelligence service for the auctionmanager and the growers, the development of standards of grading and the pro-vision of containers for growers and retailers at low hire charges fixed to coveroperating costs. An inexpensive container service would prove a useful attractionto growers and retailers. In order to ensure that adequate supplies are madeavailable, the body responsible for running the auctions should have the powerto buy, as principals, produce from growers and imported produce. It may also benecessary to acquire some existing businesses in this field.10. An auction centre should provide an auction room to accommodate,say, 250 buyers, covered display platforms for produce, office accommodation, acontainer storage depot, parking space for buyers&apos; and delivery vehicles and (where necessary) a small cafe. The general plan would be a hollow square, in the centre of which would be an open parking space for buyers&apos; vehicles waiting to be loaded.The Ministry of Works suggest that a centre of this kind, fully equipped, mightbe expected to cost about  75,000, excluding the site which would normally berented. It is hoped that some of the auction centres could be built within the boundaries of local authorities&apos; markets.11. We recommend that a public company, financed by the Exchequer and operating subject to the direction of Ministers, should be set up to organise and run the auction centres. We are advised that this would probably require legislation. in suggesting the use of the company structure, rather than the establishment of apublic corporation, we have been influenced in part by the desirability of intro-ducing some variety into our plans for socialisation. Similar companies have worked well in the Development Areas. A public company, moreover, would appear lesstop-heavy than a public corporation, for the initial small-scale experiment: and if,as we hope, the experiment is successful and further auctions are established,there should be no great difficulty in making any necessary adaptations of the controlling body to take account of its larger field of responsibility. The Govern-ment-appointed directors of the company should include at least one with experienceof the problems of growers and one similarly experienced in the wholesale orretail trade. It might be useful also to set up an advisory committee representativeof local authorities, growers, importers, wholesalers, retailers, consumers, proces-sors, &amp;c.12. The Distribution and Marketing Committee have given some attentionto the question of the re-siting of the London fruit and vegetable markets and theauthority which would be responsible for them.   I have been in touch with the
leaders of the London County Council on this subject, which will shortly he discussed by the Council itself. We propose to await the outcome of this discussionbefore framing our own recommendations. A widespread scheme of publicauctions throughout the country would reduce the quantity of produce coming tothe London markets this indeed would be one of its chief economies but an experimental scheme could go ahead independently of final decisions about London.13. We, therefore, ask our colleagues to approve, in principle, a scheme ofauctions on these lines, and to authorise discussion with the principal interests concerned and the working out of a detailed plan.H. D.Ministry of Town and Country Planning, S.W. 1,4th November, 1950.
