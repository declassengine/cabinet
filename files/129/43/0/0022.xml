DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS. BRITANNIC MA JEST YrS GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (50) 27214TH NOVEMBER. 1950CABINETLEASEHOLD PROPERTY (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BILL:APPLICATION TO THE CROWNMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorA draft of the Leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions) bill was considered this morning by the Legislation Committee (H.P.C.(50) 14thMeeting, Minute 4).   While in general the Committee approved the Bill,there was considerable discussion on Clause 15,   Under subsection (1) ofthat Clause, the Bill will apply to land held by Government Departments.Subsections (2) and (3) provide special exemptions from Part II of theBill (Renewal of tenancies of shops) in favour of Government Departments,local authorities, statutory undertakers and development corporations.2. It was recognised by the Legislation Committee that in a bill which can be alleged to inflict hardship on landlords generally, strongjustification is needed for any privilege given to public authority landlords.Scottish Ministers further pointed out that the Tenancy of Shops (Scotland)Act, 1949, contained no such exemptions.    The Act had worked smoothly andit would be difficult to justify departing from it.   On the other hand it was represented on behalf of land-owning Departments and local authorities that in the public interest it was necessary that they should have someexemption from Part II of the Bill.   The extent of the exemption provided in the draft considered by the Legislation Committee was as follows:&quot;-7^0   -is.COPY NO.32(a) Government Departments and the other public authorities wouldbe able to resist an application to the court for the renewal ofa shop tenancy on the ground that the renewal would interferewith the exercise by the Department or authority of its functions.The county court was left to judge whether, this defence havingbeen established, it was in all the circumstances reasonable torefuse the renewal.(b) Ministers, but not other public authorities, were empoweredto certify that a shop or its site was urgently required for use by a Government Department.. If such a certificate was given,the court had no jurisdiction to renew a tenancy.(c) Ministers were empowered to certify that the renewal of atenancy of a shop would be undesirable in the interests ofnational security.    If such a certificate was given, the courthad no jurisdiction to renew a tenancy.3. In view of the criticisms made of these exemptions, I was invited by the Legislation Committee to arrange immediately for interdepartmentaldiscussions, the object of which would be to see how far these exemptionscould be cut down without serious prejudice to the activities of theauthorities concerned and to bring the question of policy before theCabinet.    These discussions, necessarily hurried, and at the-1-

official level.only, took place this afternoon.   I am told that, subjectto what is said in paragraphs 5 and 6 below, there was a fair measure ofacquiescence in a proposal to omit the safeguards described in (a) and(b) of paragraph 2 above.   Instead, it was proposed to insert a provision(in Clause 11 of the Bill, which describes the grounds on which landlordsgenerally can resist the renewal of a tenancy) directing the court, where apublic authority is interested in the land, to refuse renewal where the courtis satisfied that the public interest so requires.      A draft of the relevantsubsection is set out as Annex A to this memorandum;   the new provisions are underlined.4. As for the safeguard described in (c) of paragraph 2 above, I amtold that cases are likely to arise where a real security problem is involved.Both the Service Departments and the Ministry of Supply let off premises in military and scientific establishments for use as shops.   It is possiblethat (either for reasons personal to the tenant or because of developmentsmaking it undesirable that there should continue to be a shop on the premisesat all) cases will arise where   the renewal of the shop tenancy must be prevented on security grounds.   How frequent these cases may be must bea matter of guesswork.   It seems clear, in any case, that if the securityaspect is to be dealt with it must be by Ministerial certificate.      It would notbe appropriate to leave such a question to the county court, even sitting in camera.    If the safeguard in paragraph 2(c) is kept, Clause 15will read as set out in Annex B to this memorandum.5. I think the alternative to the original Clause 15(2) and (3) is aoconsiderable improvement.   I am told that officials of the Departmentsconcerned, insofar as they assented to it, had two considerations very muchin mind.    First, they were impressed by the fact that this is, after all,only a temporary Bill;   and while most of the cases for which the wider exemptions were designed are likely to turn up in the long run, theDepartments are prepared to take the risk of their turning up in the next two years.   They suggest that it follows from this that the Bill should not inthis respect set a precedent for future permanent legislation.6. The second consideration which influenced the Departments was thatthey might to some extent be able to use existing powers of requisition or of compulsory acquisition as a substitute for the exemptions which theyare now willing to give up.   I am told that these existing powers do not cover the whole field.    Further it has been generally understood up till now that authorities are not to use requisitioning powers against their owntenants.   Officials of the Departments wish to be assured that in future the use of the powers, both of requisition and of acquisition, will beauthorised in appropriate cases where shop tenancies are involved,notwithstanding the possibility of criticism.J.House of Lords, S. W. 1. ,14TH NOVEMBER,  1950.
