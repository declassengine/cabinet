DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(50) 2881ST DECEMBER, 1950CABINETINTERIM INDEX OF RETAIL prices memorandum by the Minister of Labourand National service feel it necessary to draw the attention of my colleagues to the increasing volume of criticism of the Index of Retail Prices, both in thePress and in the House of Commons.     Some of this has been mixed up with criticism of the Governmenfs alleged failure to keep prices fromrising and has been largely political.    Some has centred on one particularepisode when the announcement of a fall of one point in the index coincided with the announcement of a number of price increases.     But there is undoubtedly some uneasiness in many quarters as to whether the indexany longer measures accurately the average change in price levels frommonth to month.     This uneasiness cannot be dismissed lightly, eventhough there may be little basis for it.     The index must not only be a goodindex but must command public confidence and be generally accepted.The index has not ceased to be a fair measure of price movements taken as a whole, but it is not so certain that it is now regarded as such by large sections of the community.2. The present index is an interim index and it has always been theintention to revise it as soon as conditions were considered to be appropriate-ate.     It was introduced in June,1947, on the recommendations of an advisory Committee appointed by me.     This Committee is a StandingDepartmental Committee under Ministry of Labour chairmanship andcontains representatives of the principal Government Departments con-cerned, together with representatives of:The British Employers&apos; Confederation,The Trades Union Congress,The Co-operative Miovement,The Retail Distributive Trades,The National Federation of Women&apos;s Institutes,and two independent statisticians from the Universities.3. This Committee was appointed on 8th August, 1946, to advise meon the basis of the then official cost of living index figure, and on matters connected therewith.     The immediate question on which the Committee was asked to advise was whether any revision of the basis of the figure was practicable or desirable in the conditions then obtaining, and if so, the revision that might be made.4. The Committee proposed in its interim report that the existingcost of living index should be terminated and that as a temporary measure,pending the results of further study and examination, a new index should beCOPY NO.32

instituted, starting at 100, in June, 1947, to show future monthly changesin the level of retail prices, weighted according to the pre-war pattern of consumption disclosed by the enquiry into working class expenditure madeby the Ministry of Labour in 1937/38.    I also appointed on their recommen-dation a Technical Committee to consider the technical problems involvedin the introduction of the interim index proposed by the AdvisoryCommittee.5. .  The recommendations of this Committee for the construction and calculation of the interim index dealt with such matters as the selec-tion of the items for which prices were to be collected, the machinery for obtaining reliable information as to prices, the localities from which such information should be collected, and the system of weighting which shouldbe adopted.     These recommendations were made on the understanding thatthe interim index was constructed to serve until such time as full con-sideration could be given to the details of a new index relating to a period when the expenditure of working class households could be recorded in a market considerably more free than it was when the Committee made itsreport.6. The present index is constructed in accordance with these various recommendations.     In effect it takes the kinds and quantities of thingspurchased by the average working class family just before the war and prices these things (a) at June, 1947, price levels and (b) at present price levels.7. One of the chief criticisms of the index is that this selection ofgoods is based on a pre-war pattern of living, which is thought to have little relation to the way in which the average household now distributesits expenditure.     When the interim index was introduced in June, 1947,the weighting basis derived from the pre-war pattern of consumption was used as a makeshift, since it was thought that household expenditure at thattime was abnormal and would be misleading if used as a basis for weightinga new index.     It was understood, however, that the interim index would bereplaced by another index as so*n as consumption patterns, had becomesufficiently stable after the war-time and immediate post-war abnormali-ties, due to rationing and scarcities.8. During the last year or so there have been substantial relaxationsof rationing, and supplies of many goods and services have become more plentiful.     It is obvious that living habits have changed since 1947, whenthe index started, but equally clearly they have not reverted to the pattern of the pre-war era.     On the evidence available it is doubtful whether an index based on the current pattern of expenditure would have shown asignificantly different rise since June, 1947.     It is, however, impossibleto prove this and such a statement cannot be expected to carry generalconviction at the present time.     There is now a widely held view that theindex is inaccurate, largely because of its pre-war weighting basis.Since it is imperative that there should be public confidence in the index,I suggest to my colleagues that the time has now come to consider whetherthe index should be revised.9. If it were considered desirable to revise the index, it would benecessary to review not only the system of weights to be used but also the classes of persons to be covered by a new index, what items should beincluded and what methods should be followed for collecting the pricesinformation.    Any revised weighting system based on current living habitswhich would command public confidence would necessitate a full-scale

budget enquiry similar to that made in 1937-38.     That enquiry involved the collection of budgets from some 12,000 households spread over twelvemonths, and any large-scale enquiry of a similar nature would be a lengthyand complex operation.     In 1947 it was possible to introduce a new indexwithin a few months of the decision to do so because the results of the pre-war budget enquiry were already available for use.   It must be emphasised that any revision of the present index based on the results of a new full-scaleenquiry into current household expenditures could not be undertaken until theresults of such an enquiry had become available.10. In the circumstances I have come to the conclusion that some action is required to meet the widespread uneasiness about the index, and I feel thatit is desirable to make an announcement that the Advisory Committee are tobe called together again.11. I suggest, therefore, that I should call the Advisory Committeetogether and ask them to consider whether the present index should be revised, and, if so, the principles on which it should be revised.    If theCommittee reports in favour of a revision and their report is accepted,the precise scope and technical details of such a revision and of thebudget enquiries that would be necessary would then require consideration.12. If my colleagues agree to this proposal, I should like to announce the decision in the House on Tuesday, 5th December, in reply to thefollowing Question which has been put down by Mr. Ellis Smith:MR. ELLIS SMITH, - To ask the Minister of Labour if heis aware of the growing concern as to the accuracy ofthe index for recording the changes in the cost of living;if it is intended to bring the index up-to-date;   or what other action is proposed.(Tuesday, 5th December)G.A.I.ry of Labour and National Service,S.W.1,1ST DECEMBER, 1950.
