0 qE.i* 0DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(50) 280 COPY NOt-22ND NOVEMBER, 1950CABINET32LEASEHOLD PROPERTY (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) bill memorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland the Attorney-general we are a little concerned to know how best to handle, during thepassage of the Leasehold Bill, the questions which are likely to be raisedconcerning the amendment of the Rent Restrictions legislation.    As our colleagues are aware, the present Bill deals almost entirely with problemsconcerning land let on ground rents for long building leases, although it hasbeen found possible incidentally to deal temporarily with one of the diffi-culties which has arisen under the Rent Restrictions Acts in regard toproperties the subject of a ground lease.     It will, however, appear duringthe course of the debates on the present Bill that a great many of the hardships now arising are the result of defects in the Rent RestrictionsActs and will not be met at all by the temporary legislation.2. In this connection we should call attention to the followingCabinet and Legislation Committee papers:-(a) Cabinet Conclusions, 20th October, 1950 (CM.(50) 66thConclusions, Minute 4):&apos;ln the course of the discussion recorded in the preceding minute attention was drawn to the extent to which hardships,arising in connection with tenancies, were due to the operationof the Rent Acts as interpreted by the courts.    A DepartmentalCommittee had some time ago reviewed the operation of the rent Acts, and had recommended that they should be overhauledand brought up to date.     During the passage of temporarylegislation about ground leases, the Government would be pressed to declare their intentions about the modification of the RentActs, and it would probably be necessary to say that inter-departmental discussions were in progress with a view tocomprehensive amending legislation being introduced.     before a statement of this kind was made, however, the Cabinet would wish to be informed of the main issues which arose out of thecurrent working of the Rent Acts. &quot;(b) Lord Chancellor&apos;s memorandum (H.P.C(50) 68) of 10thNovember, paragraph 14:&quot;I must point out to my colleagues that, save in the class of case affected by the Knightsbridge decision, this Bill will notalleviate the hardships which are said to arise in connectionwith tenancies owing to the operation of the Rent Acts as inter-preted by the courts.     Minute 4 of CM.(50) 66 records the view

of the Cabinet that, during the passage of temporary legislationabout ground leases, the Government would be pressed to declare their intentions about the modification of the Rent Acts,and that it would probably be necessary to say that inter-departmental discussions are in progress with a view tocomprehensive amending legislation being introduced.     the attorney-General and I are strongly of that opinion, especiallyhaving regard to the form in which the temporary Bill is nowcast.     I should add that the Cabinet at the same time (Minute 3)directed me to proceed forthwith with work on the formulation of long-term proposals for leasehold reform, and a committeehas already been set up for this purpose under the chairman-ship of the Attorney-General. &quot;(c)     Legislation Committee minutes, 14th November (H.P.C.(50)14th Meeting, Minute 4):&apos;In discussion, the following points were made:-(a)  As indicated by the Lord Chancellor in paragraph 14 ofhis memorandum, the Bill would not alleviate the hardshipswhich arose ouL of the operation of the Rent Acts as interpretedby the courts, save in the class of case affected by the Knights-bridge decision.     The Cabinet had recognised in their dis-cussion on 20th October last that, during the passage of thepresent temporary legislation, the Government would be pressed to declare their intentions about the modification of the RentActs, and had invited the Minister of Health and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to submit memoranda about the amendmentsrequired in the Rent Acts.     The Cabinet should have an oppor-tunity of considering these memoranda before the SecondReading debate in the House of Commons on the LeaseholdProperty (Temporary Provisions) Bill.     It was realised that,in the course of that debate, it would probably not be possibleto say more than that interdepartmental discussions were inprogress with a view to comprehensive legislation being introduced to amend the Rent Acts. &quot;3. At the meeting of the Cabinet on Monday, 20th November, thepaper submitted by the Minister of Health and Secretary of State forScotland (C.P.(50) 273) was noted but no action was decided upon, and itwas suggested that if Questions were raised in the course of the dis-cussions on the Leasehold Bill, a stalling answer should be given.4. We hardly think that this course is possible.     Certain amend-ments of the Rent Restrictions Acts would be within the scope of thepresent Bill, and it may well be that such amendments will be put down.It is in any event qtiite certain that many of the defects arising under the rent Restrictions legislation will be referred to and that the Governmentwill be pressed to make some statement as to their intentions.     the interdepartmental committee in 1943 regarded it as urgently necessarythat the present chaos of overlapping legislation should be replaced bya single comprehensive Act.     Not only has this recommendation notbeen implemented, but the chaos has been extended by the passing of two additional Statutes and by a large number of judicial decisions.     Ifamendments are tabled to the present Bill affecting problems arising

out of the Rent Restrictions legislation it will be difficult to resistthem except on the ground that they relate to a field of law which willhave to be dealt with in a more comprehensive way, and which would only be further complicated by piece-meal amendment.5* In these circumstances, and whilst realising the great political difficulty which any amendment of the Rent Restrictions Acts wouldinvolve, we feel that the Governments spokesmen must be free to say at least that the subject is being studied, although without committing the Government to legislation at any particular time.     It might be thatan appropriate form of words to be used would be something to thefollowing effect:-.&quot;The Rent Restrictions legislation has become a matterof great complexity and difficulty in which there are elevenStatutes and a very large number of judicial decisions involved.The amendment and codification of the law presents manycomplications and difficulties, but the matter is at presentforming the subject of interdepartmental study, in light ofthe results of which consideration will be given to thevarious questions of policy involved. &quot;H.IVI.H.W.S.22nd November, 1950
