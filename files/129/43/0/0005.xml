Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1950[p.c, (so) iQ2    -imim      U: -..,^,,0.-,,-,\%thOctober, 1950] &apos;    &quot; &quot; &apos; 1      &apos;  &apos; a&quot;&apos; 1&apos;CABINETProduction CommitteeCOAL SUPPLIES IN THE WINTER 1950-51;      (Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power)I have just completed my coal budget for the winter which opens at thebeginning of next month. The outlook disclosed is very disturbing. In preparingthis budget I have been in close consultation with the National Coal Board Whoare in complete agreement with the conclusions which I have reached.2. Coal Production-Even on optimistic assumptions we cannot hope thatdeep-mined production will exceed last winter&apos;s figure by more than 800,000 tons,while opencast will be down by at least 100,000 tons. Total supplies at the most areexpected to amount to 111 55 million tons, but if man-power continues&apos;to fall at its present rate we cannot be assured even of this amount.1 3. Inland Consumption-This is expected to exceed last winters figure by  - 3 million tons (3 per cent.) even if we secure that the largest practicable use of gas oil is made by the gasworks and if we abandon (as I fear we must) all hope of doing something to increase supplies to the house coal market. The principalincreases,expected are in electricity and industry. The total consumption to beexpected is 112 2 million tons.4. Stock Change.-^-! anticipate that, having regard to the level of stocks to beexpected at the end of this month and the minimum level (9 million toils) belowwhich it would be unsafe to allow them to fall at the end of the winter, it should bepossible during; the winter to draw upon stocks to the extent of 6 ,8 million tons.Export/-Bunker Availability.-It Will be seen therefore that total suppfies(current and stocklift) are likely to exceed inland consumption during the winter by no more than 6 1 million tons. This therefore as the National Coal Board agree is the maximum quantity available for exports and bunkers. This means that, ascompared with last winter when exports and bunkers amounted to 10- 5 million tons, we shall be down this winter by 4-4 million tons. Uf this differencej 2-7 million tons is due to the increase, in inland consumption expected this winter,while the remaining 1-7 million tons represents the extent by which we helpedexports last winter by depleting our stocks. The reduction in exports this winter is thus very substantial. Nevertheless, a reduction of this amount is indispensible ifwe are to avoid a widespread and prolonged fuel crisis in the early part pf 1951.6. End-October Stocks. Our stock target for the end of the summer was aminimum of 16-5 million tons. At the present moment stocks amount only to14-8 million tons and it cannot be expected that by the end of the month they Willat the most have risen higher than 15-8 million tons. On the other hand, the lower prices scheme for house coal this summer has raised sales to domestic consumers to a level higher by more than 800,000 tons than in the summer of 1949; of this amountat least 300,000 tons now in the householders&apos; cellars would almost certainly have notbeen bought if it had not been for the incentive provided by the scheme, and havenot yet been burnt by the purchasers; they can therefore legitimately be regarded aspart of our general end-summer stocks. Thus from the overall point of view, weare entitled to treat the end-October stock of ahout 15-8 million tons now expected39585
2as being equivalent of a stock of 16 1 million ,ton$; This, means that we shallstart the winter with stocks too low by at least 400,000&apos;tons. This constitutes aserious danger in view of the unfavourable outlook for production and the certainty that inland consumption will be substantially higher than in the winter of 1949-50.7. Action Recommended. We must take every possible step toi ward toff I therisk of a serious fuel crisis early in the New Year. There is nothing that .^e can dpeither to increase production above the level now expected or to reducethelevelof inland consumption. The only action which we can take between now andChristmas is to alter the phasing of exports in November and December in such away as to give inland consumers a larger share, and exports a smaller share, ofsuch supplies as are available. Hitherto it had been proposed that out of the totalof 6 1 million tons expected to be available for exports and bunkers during thewinter, 2-5 million tons should be provided during the last nine weeks of the presentyear, an average of about 300,000 tons a week. I have discussed this question indetail with Lord Hyndley who agrees that in the circumstances the only possible course open to us is to reduce the provision for exports and bunkers during november and December by 50,000 tons a week. This should provide about400,000 extra tons of coal for inland requirements by the end of the year and thussecure that our total end-December stocks amount to about 14 million tons, which both Lord Hyndley and I regard as the minimum level necessary to avoid a fuelcrisis., ^ j      .8. I must warn my colleagues that bad weather in November and Decembermay prevent us reaching 14 million tons at the end of December.. Further, even ifwe do reach the 14 million tons at that date, while it should be sufficient to avoid afuel crisis, inland consumption is now at such a high level that, even if we had hadlarger stocks than those now proposed (14 million tons at the end of December,which is equivalent to 16-5 million tons at the end of October) there can be no certainty of getting through this winter without trouble.9. The adoption of the course proposed should not in itself reduce the totalavailability for export and bunkers during the winter below the 6 -1 million tons estimated to be available for that purpose. It does mean, however, that at besttotal exports arid bunkers in the present calendar year will barely exceed 17 million tons. I am not at the moment in a position to say whether the reduction of exportsarid bunkers to an average of 250,000 tons in the months of November and december will render impossible the performance of commercial contracts whichhave already been entered into, but it may well do so. Lord Hyndley is examiningthis aspect as a matter of urgency and has promised to furnish me with a report on it within the next few days.10. If it is found that breaches of contract will be inevitable, it will be necessaryto protect the National Coal Board and the United Kingdom coal exporters bywithholding export licences during November and December to such extent asmay be required. .    .. r P.
