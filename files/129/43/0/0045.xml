THIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.    November 1950SECRET -Copy No.    3C.P. (50) 295. ., .21st November, 1950CABINETPRICES OF UTILITY WOOL BLANKETSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues are already aware of the very big rise in world prices of rawwool during the past year, particularly since the Australian auctions opened inAugust. The effect of this is not likely to be felt in the prices of most utility woollengoods in the shops until some time in 1951 since price-control is operated in sucha way as to force manufacturers and traders to sell for a considerable period at prices based on the old, and not the replacement cost of the material. But thereis one case, blankets, where the time-lag between the purchase of raw wool andthe sale of the finished products is relatively short, and in view of the size andgravity of the increase involved I feel it should be brought to the attention of mycolleagues.2. In the case of blankets, raw material costs account for an exceptionally high proportion - as much as three-quarters   of the manufacturers&apos; selling price.The manufacturers&apos; maximum prices for utility blankets were increased by varyingamounts in May to cover the increase in the cost of wool up to January. I am now considering an application which they made some weeks ago for a further increaseof at least 66 J per cent, which is more than justified by the rise of nearly 130 percent, between January and September in the prices of the cross-bred wools which constitutes the main raw material for the bulk of utility blanket production. Thismeans that, to take as an example a typical medium quality utility blanket with amaximum retail price of about  5 a pair six months ago and  6 12s. today, we are faced with an increase to  11 in the early months of next year. Careful examinationof all the relevant figures has shown that an increase of this order is the minimum necessary to ensure continuity of production and adequacy of supplies even at the reduced level of demand which may be expected to result from such a sharp pricerise. I feel, however, that in view of the implications of such an increase, I ought,before approving this increase, to bring the matter to the notice of my colleagues.3. I must, if disruption of production is to be avoided, inform the manu-facturers within the next week of the decision on their application; but I think Ican postpone the date of the operation of the increase in manufacturers&apos; maximum prices for a month or so, and I am considering whether, without causing unduedislocation of the trade, special measures can be taken to delay the consequentialincrease in maximum retail prices. (This will, of course, depend upon the stock position about which a special enquiry is in progress.) Distributors&apos; margins willbe reviewed, but any reduction that could be made under this head would offsetonly a very small part of the increase necessitated by the rise in raw material prices.4. It would, I fear, be unwise to count on a fall in the world price of woolin the near future. The New Zealand auctions which have just opened show no sign whatever of such a fall; and it is impossible to predict what may be the effecton prices of any special arrangements resulting from the talks now proceeding inAustralia about the supplies of wool for United States military requirements. Itseems unlikely that they can do more than check a further rise.5. I mention this question of blankets to my colleagues because an increasein maximum prices of 66 f per cent, will be far greater than any single increase so39722
far announced for consumer goods. (It is true that the maximum prices for carpetshave been increased   also by reason mainly of the rise in raw wool prices   byabout 50 per cent, during the course of this year, but this has been done in three separate stages.) The rise in raw wool prices is, of course, also having a serious effect on wool cloth prices, and consequently on garment prices. The maximum prices for utility woollen and worsted apparel cloths were increased in June, andthe consequent increase of about 10 per cent, in maximum garment prices will soonbegin to be felt in the shops. Manufacturers of wool apparel cloths are now seeking still higher maximum prices, and these may mean further increases ingarment prices of 15-20 per cent, which would not, however, be reflected in the shops until the second half of next year.H.
