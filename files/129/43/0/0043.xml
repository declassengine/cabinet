Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (50) 29329th November, 1950CABINETCONTACTS WITH THE PRESSNote by the Prime MinisterInstances have occurred recently where journalists have proved unreliable andI should therefore like to remind my colleagues of the need for discretion in theirdealings with the Press.2. Some guidance on this question was given in the notes (CP. (49) 95) which I circulated in April, 1949, on various questions of procedure. Thus, in paragraph 49of those notes, I said that special interviews granted to individual representativesof the Press should be confined, as a general rule, to elucidating the policy or workof the Minister and Department concerned. In paragraph 35 I also made the generalpoint that it is contrary to the doctrine of collective responsibility to make known theattitude of individual Ministers on matters of Government policy. In paragraph 39,in relation to speeches, I said that Ministers must be careful, when dealing with matters within the responsibility of other Ministers, not to embarrass them by state-ments at variance with Ministerial pronouncements; and that in all cases of doubtthey should consult the Minister concerned. This advice is also relevant to conver-sations which Ministers may have with representatives of the Press.3. Ministers should also bear in mind, when accepting invitations to meetmembers of the Press on informal or &quot; off the record &quot; occasions, that they shouldtake steps to satisfy themselves that the Pressmen whom they will meet can be relied upon to observe the usual courtesies of discretion and will not attribute to ministers by name statements made in the course of informal conversation.4. I should like also to remind my colleagues of what was said in paragraph 41of CP. (49) 95 about conversations on foreign policy at social functions. If anysuch conversation takes place a note should, wherever possible, be made of the salientpoints of the conversation and a copy sent to the Foreign Secretary. This rule shouldbe applied not merely to conversations at Embassies but to conversations withanyone who may make use of the information given to him either to report it to aforeign Government or an editor or to quote it in the Press.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, SWA,29th November, 1950.39712
