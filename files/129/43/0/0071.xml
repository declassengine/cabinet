THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;8   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet: December 1950CONFIDENTIALCP. (50) 321ISth December, 1950CABINETLEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING CLAIMS FOR SALARY  *INCREASES BY TOWN CLERKSMemorandum by the Attorney-GeneralThe recent claims for an increased scale of salaries on the part of town clerks,some of whom are not altogether underpaid now, has given rise to some politicalanxiety and my colleagues may like to have a note of the legal position, about whichI recently advised the Minister of Labour in some detail.1. In 1948 a body called the Joint Negotiating Committee for Town clerks and District Council Clerks was set up as a result of agreement between the differentLocal Authority Associations, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, Associationsrepresenting the town clerks, the clerks of urban district councils, and the localgovernment clerks respectively. This body is not strictly a Whitley Council andits recommendations are not binding, being of an advisory character only. its purpose was to make recommendations as to salary scales.2. &apos; This Joint Negotiating Committee on 8th September, 1949, recommendedset scales for Town and County District Clerks, based upon the&apos; population of their areas, rising from  500- 800 in the case of areas with a population of under 5,000to  3,000- 3,500 in the case of populations of 400,000 to 600,000 with completediscretion in the case of larger populations.3. These recommendations, which were stated to have been made after carefulconsideration of the White Paper on Personal Incomes (Command 7321), in factresulted in substantial salary increases in many cases. A large number (270) ofLocal Authorities have accepted the recommendations, but a number (possibly as many as a hundred) have declined to implement them on the grounds that this isnot the time for such increases and that in any event the salary of town clerksshould be related to their personal qualifications rather than to a flat rate basedon population alone.4. In these circumstances, certain town clerks who are in dispute with their local authorities in regard to this matter are alleging that a trade dispute existsand that the Minister of Labour is bound to refer this to arbitration by the national arbitration Tribunal under the National Arbitration and Conditions of Employ-ment Order, 1940 (No. 1305).5. This Order was, of course, intended, in order to avoid industrial stoppages,to deal with trade disputes between workmen and employers and it seems mostanomalous to consider the present a &quot; trade dispute &quot; or a town clerk a &quot; workman.&quot;Moreover, the composition of the National Arbitration Tribunal is somewhatinappropriate for dealing with a claim like the present one. I have, however,reluctantly had to advise that under the language of the Order a town clerk is a&quot; workman &quot; and a dispute between him and his authority is a &quot; trade dispute.&quot;Indeed, the position had already been somewhat compromised in this respect by thefact that the Departments concerned had previously regarded professional officers,such as, for instance, a medical officer of health and a director of education, ascoming within the scope of compulsory arbitration orders.39803Copy No.32
6. Assuming that I am right in thinking that a town clerk is a &quot; workman &quot;and a dispute as to his future salary is a &quot; trade dispute&quot; (and althoughMr. Ungoed Thomas has given an opinion tending in a contrary sense I really haveno doubt about the matter) the remaining question is whether, on such a disputebeing reported to him, the Minister of Labour is obliged to refer it to arbitration.The law as to this is by no means clear and it may be settled in a case now actuallypending in the Courts. It is, however, at least arguable that the Minister has a discretion and that he is not bound to take any steps under the Order to promote asettlement if he does not think it expedient so to do. , ,. .7. I do not know whether political or administrative steps could have beentaken or could still be taken now to point out the merely advisory character of theJoint Committee&apos;s recommendation, and the unsuitability of scale rates forprofessional officers whose qualifications and the extent of whose duties do not by any means universally correspond with the size of the populations which theyserve. From the legal point of view, however, the position now is that if the matter has to be referred to arbitration under Order No. 1305, it will be difficult to avoid a general increase in all these salaries up to the recommended scales.H.
