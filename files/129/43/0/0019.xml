rs9si wIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 269COPY NO.   9 914TH NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETOVERSEAS OPERATIONS (SECURITY OF FORCES) BILL,Memorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland the Home secretary at their meeting on 6th November (CM. (50) 71stConclusions, Minute 4), the Cabinet invited the Lord president  to bring before them at an early date the question whether the OverseasOperations (Security of Forces) Bill should be introduced in the present session of Parliament.2. When the Cabinet discussed the question of introducing theBill at their meeting on 16th October (C. M. (50) 64th Conclusions) theoperations in Korea seemed to be nearing an end;  but developments since then, and in particular the intervention of the Chinese with troops and equipment, seem to us to justify the introduction of the Bill.3. We have had prepared and circulate herewith a fresh draftof the Bill. We invite the Cabinet to consider the following points which arise on this draft:-(a)   It has hitherto been proposed that both for the purposes ofthe present operations in Korea and for the purposesof any future operations the Bill should be brought intoforce by Order in Council.   We suggest, however, thatfor the purposes of the present operations parliament might reasonably be asked to agree that the Bill should come into force at once and should continue in force for six months.    If it were desired to continue its operationafter that period or to bring it into force at some later date, the Order in Council procedure would apply.To give effect to this suggestion Clause 1 of the draft Billcirculated to the Cabinet on 12th September has been amended and it now appears as Clause 9 of the draftcirculated herewith.(b)   In our memorandum of 12th October (CP. (50) 229)it was suggested that the second of the two alternativeversions of Clause 2 shown in the draft Bill should beadopted.   This point was not discussed in detail by theCabinet on 16th October, and on further consideration inthe light of the propaganda actually carried on by the&quot;Daily Worker&quot; we have come to the conclusion thatthe first alternative is to be preferred.   Under the second

COit is open to the accused to plead that he had reasonable cause for believing his statements to be true in so faras they were statements of fact and that it was in the publicinterest to publish them.    This is not only contradictoryin that it implies that the publication of matter likely to prejudice the operations of His Majesty&apos;s or associatedforces could be in the public interest, but also offers the defence scope for carrying out political propaganda in the trial.   On the other hand, under the first alternativeall that is necessary is to prove that the systematicpublication was intended and likely to prejudice theoperations, and it is believed that for the purposes ofestablishing^ intent it would be possible to point tomatter published before the passage of the Act.   We are advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions that if thesecond alternative had been in force when the pamphlet&quot;I saw the truth in  Korea&quot; was published, then, even thoughit had been established that the pamphlet was part of a systematic publication, it would ha.ve been difficult tosecure a conviction, since, obnoxious as the pamphlet is,there are many statements of fact in it in respect of whichthe accused might have argued that he had reasonable grounds for believing them to be true and that it was in thepublic interest chat they should be published.(c) A new Clause (Clause 8) has tentatively been included in thedraft Bill in order to confer power to requisition ships for the purposes of any operations of the type coveredby the Bill.    These powers are required, since it isdoubtful whether under the existing powers the Ministry ofTransport could requisition ships.    The rest of the Bill,however, deals with criminal offences directed against the safety of i-iis Majesty&apos;s forces and the Minister of Trans-port doubts whether a Clause dealing with the requisitioning of ships should be included.(d) The Minister of Labour considers that, before the Bill is introduced,the Trades Union Congress and the british employers&apos; Confederation should be consulted about theprovisions of Clause 1(5) relating to strikes.4. The preamble to the Bill states that its purpose is to enable his Majesty&apos;s Government to discharge their responsibilities for maintaining collective security and preserving world peace and order,and when the Bill is before Parliament the Government will probably be askedasked whether from the international point of view they regard thepresent operations as a war or collective police action.    The practicalaspects of the international status of the Korean conflict are already being examined by direction of the Cabinet (CM. (50) 60th Conclusions,Minute 2)-and it may be that when, the results of this examination are known it will be found that legislation is necessary.    For example, if itwere decided that the better course is to regard the conflict from theinternational point of view as collective police action, it might benecessary to affirm for the removal of doubt that certain powers under our domestic law which have hitherto been exercised only in war should be exercisable notwithstanding the international status of the conflict.    Moreover, even if it were decided to regard the conflict as war, it would be necessary to arm the executive with additional powers.

In addition, it will no doubt be necessary sooner or later to amend theUnited Nations Act, 1946, which enables economic sanctions to be imposed if the Security Council so decide under Article 41 of the charter, so as to enable sanctions also to be imposed if under the new procedure evolved by the General Assembly of the United Nations theGeneral Assembly should recommend this.    The Overseas Operations(Security of Forces) Bill is not, however, in our opinion, a suitable one for dealing with these matters, and if any changes in the law arerequired separate legislation will have to be introduced.h. m.j .
