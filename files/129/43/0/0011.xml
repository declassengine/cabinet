As the Chief Whip urgentlyrequires the Bill to be presented on Thursday afternoon, I have no option but to ask the Cabinet to treat this as a matter of urgency arising out ofthe previous Cabinet discussion (CM.(50) 65th Conclusions, Minute 4),which led to a decision that Ministers should be free to vote according toconscience, but did not deal specifically with the nature of the statement to be made or the part which Ministers should play in the debate.2. I ask my colleagues:-(1)       to approve the draft statement attached;   and(2)       to decide what part shall be played by Ministers indebates on the Bill.H.M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,S.W.1,8TH NOVEMBER, 1950.

9 9ANNEXDraft Statement on Presentation of the bill Bill is being presented today to legalise, or remove doubts about the legality of, the opening on Sunday of certain places of publicresort to be provided as part of the Festival of Britain, 1951.     The Bill,which is a short measure, provides that nothing in the Sunday ObservanceActs, 1625-1780, shall apply in relation to opening on Sundays after12.30 p. m. of the London Festival Exhibitions of Science, Books andArchitecture and the main Exhibition on the South Bank, and of the FestivalPleasure Gardens.     The Bill is being introduced by the Government afterconsultation with the Advisory Committee of Christian Churches for the festival of Britain, 1951, and the Churches have signified that they would regard legislation for this purpose as non-controversial except in so faras it extends to the opening of the Amusement Area of the FestivalPleasure Gardens to which the Churches are resolutely opposed.     TheBoard of Festival Gardens Limited have on the other hand represented tothe Government that they attach the greatest importance to being permitted to open on Sunday the whole of the Festival Pleasure Gardens, includingthe Amusement Area.     As the question of opening the Amusement Area isone on which strong conscientious divergences. of view exist, the Govern-ment have so drafted the Bill as to invite on this, issue a free vote of theHouse for all Members - whether Ministers or not.     The Government asa whole take no collective view on this issue of the opening of theAmusement Area.
