(50) 28930th November, 1950CABINETTHE FUTURE OF THE EAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUT scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Ministerof FoodSummaryThere seems no escape from the view that the original conception of the east african Groundnut Scheme must be abandoned. It has not proved possible to carryon &quot; the large-scale production of groundnuts &quot; on a commercial basis and thereis no hope of the United Kingdom receiving any significant supply of oilseeds fromthis scheme. This is the inevitable conclusion which must be drawn from the revised long-term plan (Annex I) which the Overseas Food Corporation have sub-mitted for our consideration and on which we now seek the views of our colleagues.We have set out the reason why we believe that the original conception must be abandoned and we have sought to re-define the objectives of the scheme. If our colleagues accept this view it follows that departmental responsibility for the futuredirection of the scheme should be transferred from the Ministry of Food to theColonial Office. If our recommendations are approved we propose that the new basis for the scheme should be published as a White Paper before the christmas recess.   A preliminary draft of such a White Paper is attached (Annex III).Last Year&apos;s Plan2. When the Cabinet considered the future of the East African GroundnutsScheme a year ago (CM. (49) 66 Conclusions) they accepted a plan prepared by the overseas Food Corporation to clear 600,000 acres of bush in Tanganyika by 1954.The Corporation^ plan was to complete the clearing of 90,000 acres at Kongwawhich were already nearly finished and to clear 90,000 acres at Urambo and 420,000acres in the Southern Province. The Corporation estimated that the whole plancould be carried out within a &quot;total borrowing of  47- 6 million. By the end of1950 clearing at Kongwa and Urambo would have been completed and 22,000 acreswould have been cleared in the Southern Province. The Corporation expected to borrow  36,500,000 by the end of March 1951.Experience of the Past Year3. The Corporation have not been able to achieve the targets for 1950, andthe experience of the past year has, moreover, convinced them that the 600,000 acreplan is not attainable either within the time or at the cost previously estimated. at kongwa 90,000 acres were cleared by the end of 1949, but at Urambo only 50,000acres will be completely cleared by the end of this year and in the Southern Provinceno more than 7,200 acres. Thus, instead of 202,000 acres cleared by the end of1950 as had been planned, there will be a cleared area of only 147,000 acres.4. The area available for agriculture will be even less. The Cabinet havealready accepted the Corporation^ recommendations that, as the Kongwa working party proposed, only a limited acreage of land at Kongwa should be used for agriculture during the next three years (CM. (50) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 2).This and the fact that the hoped for acreages have not been cleared in the other two afeas mean that instead of planting and harvesting 182,000 acres in 1951 asthey had previously planned, the Corporation will be using only 64,650 acres of39709 &apos; copy No. 341
cleared land for agriculture. It is true that, by the end of March 1951, the Cor-poration&apos;s borrowings are not expected to amount to more than the original estimateof  36,500,000, but their productive assets will fall very far short of expectations.5. The discrepancy between the Corporation^ objectives and their achieve-ments has been so great that they have had to make a complete recast of their plans.This discrepancy has been due, not to any single difficulty or disaster, but to a:number of different factors resulting from conditions in Tanganyika.The Corporations Revised Plan6. What the Corporation now propose is a 7-year programme of agricultureand development, with detailed agricultural plans for the first three years up to1954 and a full review of the development side of their activities at that time. no more clearing is envisaged at Kongwa or Urambo, and the further clearing whichis proposed in the Southern Province would be done by a slower but less costlymethod involving partly mechanical and partly hand labour. They propose tofell 40,000 acres of bush during the rainy season which is just beginning, and toiclear and prepare this ground for agriculture over the next three years with a verymuch smaller land clearing team than is at present employed This team would continue further felling and clearing at the rate of about 15,000 acres a year and,unless the review in 1954 led to a change in policy, this rate of clearing would continue up to 1957. The. total cleared area in the Southern Province would thus be increased to about 105;000 acres by 1957, with a further 45,000 acres felled, andin various stages of preparation for agriculture.7. During the next three years the total acreages which the Corporationpropose to plant are:  Each year, 12,450 acres would be planted at Kongwa and 45,000 acres at Urambo.The acreage in the Southern Province would increase from 7,200 acres in 1950-51to 24,000 acres in 1952-53. About half the planted acreage would be undergroundnuts each year.8. By 31st March, 1951, the Corporation expect to have borrowed  36,500,000.The new plan envisages further development expenditure from that date up to1957 of  5,678,000, but provision has to be made for losses on farming operationsup to 1953, for headquarters expenditure, for past commitments, for running downand compensation expenses, for accumulated depreciation and for contingencies,amounting in all to a further  5,072,000. This assumes an expenditure of some 47,250,000, but the net expenditure will only be  45 million, because the Corpora-tion expect to receive  2,250,000 for the sale of surplus equipment. Thus theCorporation^ plan envisages a further borrowing of  8,500,000 without any pro-vision for agricultural losses after 1953.  2,500,000 has been invested in orearmarked for the Queensland-British Food Corporation and the total borrowingsrequired by the Overseas Food Corporation to carry out their plan are thusestimated at  47,500,000. This is  2-1 million short of the limit of  50 million set to their borrowing power, and the Corporation have assumed that they would beable to draw on the balance to meet any agricultural losses or contingencies forwhich their reserves proved inadequate.The Nature of the New Plan9. The plan which the Overseas Food Corporation have now put forward isvery different from the scheme that which was originally approved by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and on the basis of which work was begun in East Africa. Therecommendations of the Wakeheld Mission which visited East and Central africa in 1946 were based upon the conception of a fully mechanised scheme which wouldmake a very considerable contribution within a short period to the world shortageof oils and fats. The proposal was to clear by 1952 no less than 3J million acres of bush of which 1,605,000 acres were to be planted annually. The annual produc-tion of shelled groundnuts was estimated at 600,000 tons. This would have provided about 276,000 tons of oil a year.10.

The Corporation^ Objectives13. The Corporation^ objective is to make the best use of the real andfinancial resources which they have assured to be available. In addition to ground-nuts, maize and sorghum they hope to grow millet, cotton and possibly tobacco,while at Kongwa they have embarked upon cattle ranching. They are thus propos-ing a form of experimental mixed farming with products partly for export andpartly for local consumption. But the proposals are put forward with importantqualifications as to the results which may be expected. The Corporation considerthat &quot; given freedom from natural calamity, their agriculture ought in time (notnecessarily within the seven-year period of the plan) to pay its way and cover its future overheads and the depreciation on the assets retained for use.&quot; In other words they can hold out no hope that it will be able to pay any return on thecapital which has already been invested, and they can at present offer no prospectof servicing the capital which will be required to finance the future clearing whichthey propose for the Southern Province.14. Indeed, it is not possible for the Corporation to say when the yearlyoperation of the cleared land will be such as to meet current costs. In expressing the hope that their farming operations will in time pay their way the Board havemade certain assumptions about which some uncertainty must be felt. The points of doubt are: - (i) the nature of the crops to be grown in the three areas (particularly inthe Southern Province where there has so far been very little agri-cultural experience) and the yields likely to be obtained;(ii) the risk of drought in Kongwa and Urambo;(hi) the extent to which the incidence of heavy rainfall in the Southern Provincemay disturb and hinder agricultural operations;(iv) the fact that a form of farming organisation which can be run economicallyhas yet to be evolved.  This may present particular difficulties in theSouthern Province where, for topographical reasons, the farms will bescattered.Only further experience can show to what extent anxiety on these scores is well founded.though very much less ambitious than the original programme, would, neverthe-less, if successful, have made a significant contribution to our supplies of oils and fats. It was hoped to produce about 180,000 tons of groundnuts and sunflowerseeds or some 63,000 tons of oils a year by 1954.11. The revised long-term programme now put forward by the Overseas food corporation in effect recognises the abandonment of the original concept of thescheme. They have stated in their submission that &quot; the groundnut is not a plantwhich lends itself readily to mass methods over vast acreages.&quot; Out of the areaof some 81,000 acres to be cropped in 1952-53 only about half would be oilseeds.The annual production of oilseeds by 1953 would be about 13,000 tons, which,ignoring any allowance for seed and other uses in East Africa, would produce alittle over 5,000 tons of oil. The United Kingdom&apos;s weekly usage of all oils foredible purposes is 15,000 tons of which 5,000 tons are soft oils. Thus by 1953 theCorporation^ new plan would contribute just over a week&apos;s supply of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s consumption of soft oils, and that only after further very heavy capitalexpenditure. In addition the scheme is expected to produce about 21,000 tonsof coarse grains an insignificant quantity in relation to the United Kingdom&apos;sneeds of over 3  million tons.12. Finally the Corporation report that they see no prospect of fulfilling their obligations under Section 15 (1) of the Overseas Resources Development Act. ThisSection imposes upon the Corporation the obligation &quot; so to exercise and performtheir functions as to secure that their revenues are not less than sufficient to meet all sums properly chargeable to their revenue account .... taking one year with another.&quot;In short the Board state that the scheme can no longer be regarded as acommercial enterprise for the large-scale production of oilseeds, and thereforefunds can no longer be made available on the old statutory basis. If the schemeis to go on it must do so as a new type of enterprise and on a different basis.
Economics of the New Plan15. The revenue-earning potential of the cleared land in the year ending30th September, 1953, has been examined by officials both on the basis of the assumptions made by the Board and also on some alternative assumptions aboutprices and yields. The income of the scheme will depend on the yield per acreof the crop cultivated and the price per ton obtained for them. In order to minimise the variables it is assumed that the Board&apos;s expectations of yields of coarse grainsare obtained and that the groundnut yield is either 700 lb. per acre, the Corpora-tion&apos;s figure for Urambo and the Southern Province, or 500 lb. per acre the latteran assumption made by the Ministry of Food in the light of yields elsewhere. Threelevels of price for groundnuts have been assumed  60,  50 and  40 per ton atrailhead.Price per ton of groundnuts at railhead     60 50 40Groundnut yeilds Agricultural profit (-f) or loss (-) per acrePer acre      700 1b..........     +1-3 -0-2 -1-6500 1b..........     -1-5 -2-5 -3-516. This estimate of profit or loss is based on an estimate of cost of productionof  11-9 per acre covering farm costs, farm depreciation, and regional overheads,but ignoring depreciation (other than that on farm implements), central adminis-trative overheads, writing off of land clearing costs and development and interest on advances. It shows that without taking into account the higher priced cropswith which the Corporation are experimenting, the only prospect of covering the costs of production is if yields of 700 lb. per acre are obtained and if the pricepaid at railhead is above  50 per ton. Last year&apos;s purchase of groundnuts from east Africa was made at a comparable price of  44. Next year&apos;s price for ground-nuts based on the price which the Ministry of Food have agreed to pay for west african groundnuts would be about  61 \0s. at railhead, but it would be unwise to base estimates on the indefinite continuance of these very high prices.17. In the light of the factors brought out in the Corporation^ report it isclear that their revised plan cannot be justified on commercial grounds even if aperiod of fructification is assumed. It is only necessary to draw particular attention to:  (i) the anxieties about the way in which the actual agricultural performancewill conform to the estimates (in view of the limited experience onwhich they have been based);(ii) the fact that even if all the assumptions are realised, the food availablefor the United Kingdom will be insignificant in relation to our requirements;(iii) the great uncertainty of securing any adequate return on the schemehowever it may be capitalised.Should the Scheme go on?18. We have had to consider whether, in these circumstances, it is justifiable to continue the scheme at all. Last year the Cabinet were advised that on purelyfinancial grounds it would not be possible to recommend the acceptance of theplan which the Corporation then put forward. The new plan proposes expenditureon about the same scale as the previous one, but offers a much more limited assetat the end. It could be argued that the prospects of any return of financial or commercial significance on this smaller project are not such as to justify devotingfurther resources to it. If this new plan were to be assessed solely by commercialcriteria to which the Ministry of Food must have regard, we are agreed that therewould be no alternative but to recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to seek to cut their losses on this venture by closing down the scheme at once.19. However, the significance of this development work cannot be measuredin terms of commercial considerations alone, and many of the reasons which were accepted last year as a justification for continuing operations are still valid. Itwould not be right to assume that, because the original conception of the schemeto produce a large new supply of oilseeds within a few years has failed, the wholeproject is worthless and must be abandoned.
20. We recognise that from the point of view of United Kingdom food supplies in the short term, the reasons which made the scheme of special immediatesignificance to the Ministry of Food no longer apply. But from the point of viewof colonial development and of world food supplies in the long term as well as fromthe wider political point of view, the reasons for continuing the scheme which were accepted last year are still applicable.The Colonial Development Case21. From a colonial development point of view the issue can be simply stated.It is generally recognised that if the agricultural resources of the African territories are to be properly developed, a means of bringing new areas under cultivation andof improving the efficiency of farming methods must be found. When the ground-nuts scheme was started it was widely publicised as a major contribution to theeconomic development of East Africa by the introduction of such new methods.Although our original hopes have not been realised, the Corporation have alreadycleared a substantial acreage for agriculture and have assembled the facilities forfurther clearing. Workshops, hospitals and other installations have been created at great cost; a railway has been specially provided for the project in the southern province and a port is in an advanced stage of construction; roads and other facilities have been provided. Above all, the Corporation have acquired thetechnical knowledge and skill which, although the experimental work is stillincomplete, make them a leading authority on clearing technique. In consideringthe future of the scheme we cannot approach it as if it were a new commercialagricultural project. We must take into account the assets which have been created and the technical knowledge which has been assembled. If we were to abandon the project without trying to turn it to useful advantage and without giving farmingoperations a proper chance to prove themselves, we should not simply be giving upthe scheme; we should be abandoning in mid-course a project which, in spite of its early setbacks, may in the long run be of the utmost importance to the future of colonial development.The World&apos;s Long-Term Needs22. The world need for increased food supplies in the long term, especially of oils and fats, is as urgent to-day as when we started the scheme and is bound tobecome more urgent as world population increases and standards of living rise. Inthe long run the deficiency can only be met by bringing into cultivation new landswhich have so far not been economical to develop. By existing methods ofagriculture, colonial territories in Africa with their own rising populations, cannothope materially to increase their exports of foodstuffs. If they are to make a sub-stantial contribution in the future to world food supplies they can only do so from new lands and by new techniques of agriculture. It is for the purpose of testing and establishing the economics of such new techniques that we regard it as particularly important to continue the scheme; if we are successful in this work it is clear that,both from the point of view of colonial development and of world food supplies in the long term, the results may have far wider significance than the scale of opera-tions now projected. The Corporation have not yet found a means of bringing newlands into cultivation at a cost which enables them to produce relatively low pricedcrops on a commercial basis. In our view it is essential that the working out oftechniques should go on. For all these reasons we feel that it would be indefensibleto give up the scheme now.The Political Consequences of Abandonment23. The political repercussions which might be expected at home, in EastAfrica and throughout the world if we abandoned the scheme would be deplorable.At home we have proclaimed our faith in the concept of public investment in over-seas development. Only public enterprise can take the risks and find the large sums of money needed for pioneering investment projects to open up new areas.If we fail to persevere with our efforts and make no attempt to turn our experience to some reasonable account, we may discredit the principle of public enterprise inthis field. In the original White Paper (Cmd. 7030) it was stated that &quot; While theimmediate reason for the launching of this scheme is the urgent need for newsupplies of fats for the United Kingdom, His Majesty&apos;s Government believe thatits long term importance may lie even more in the practical demonstration it willprovide of the improved productivity, health, social welfare and prosperity which
scientific agriculture can bring to Africa.&quot; The need for proof Of what scientificagriculture can bring to undeveloped parts of Africa is as urgent now as it was in1946. More attention is focussed today in the United Kingdom, in the United States,and elsewhere on the need for the opening up of undeveloped areas. The abandon-ment of the scheme would conflict with our policy of colonial development and of mutual aid for the development of backward territories generally.A New Basis for the Work24. We recommend, therefore, that work in East Africa should go on andthat its continuance should be based on the need for a development project designedto establish the economics of bush clearing and agriculture which, in particular,will:  (i) make the best use of the agricultural assets of the old scheme;(ii) make some contribution to the further development of Tanganyika;(iii) provide experience in clearing and cultivating land which may be of value to the whole Colonial Empire.Transfer of Ministerial Responsibility25. If it is agreed that work should go forward on the new basis of an experi-mental Colonial development project, it follows that responsibility for the new scheme should pass to the Secretary of State for the Colonies and we recommendthat this transfer should be arranged. We have considered whether in thesecircumstances any change in the administrative arrangements for the scheme are desirable. But we have reached the conclusion that there are strong reasons for retaining the present form of organisation, although we should propose to make asubstantial reduction both in the number of full-time members of the Board andin the size of the Corporations London office. The Corporation are them-selves undertaking a very substantial reduction and reorganisation of their east african staff. The Board of the Corporation who have drawn up the programme on which this reorganisation is based and who, therefore, best understand the implications of carrying it out have the responsibility of giving to the staff in EastAfrica a feeling of stability in the very difficult circumstances of readjustment. Notonly would a change in the form of administration be a danger to morale, but the objectives which the Board had in mind in drawing up their plan might well be lost.26. We have also considered the possibility of transferring responsibility forthe scheme to the Tanganyika Government, or alternatively to the colonial development Corporation. But neither of these alternatives commends itself. the Tanganyika Government have neither the administrative nor the financial resources to enable them to accept responsibility for the scheme at this stage, and even without these decisive practical objections, we do not believe that it would be acceptable toParliament that responsibility for a scheme in which the United Kingdom has sucha large financial stake should be transferred to the Government of Tanganyika, itmay well be that at some later stage when the economics of the scheme have beenestablished and appropriate financial arrangements have been made a transfer ofresponsibility for the operation of the agricultural holdings to the Government of tanganyika will provide the right solution, and this consideration, together withthe advantages which will accrue to the Corporation from close association withthe Government in charge of the territory in which they are operating, lead usto feel that the Government of Tanganyika should from now on be represented onthe Board of the Corporation.   Arrangements are being made to this end.27. Now that the scheme must be regarded as a project of Colonial develop-nient, the natural course might seem to be to transfer responsibility for it to theColonial Development Corporation. But there are strong reasons for rejectingthis alternative: -(i) The Colonial Development Corporation in the same way as the overseas food Corporation are required by the terms of the Overseas resources development Act to conduct their operations on a commercial basis.The financial considerations mentioned in paragraph 34 below show thatit would be quite inappropriate for the scheme to be. controlled by a body functioning under such conditions. Indeed, the new basis of: operation as an experimental development project makes it essential thatthe scheme should be freed from, these.very sections of the OverseasResources Development Act.
(ii) The Colonial Development Corporation have already an immense task ontheir hands; They have now some fifty projects under way, of many different types and scattered all over the Colonial Empire, while other projects are under active investigation. They are already finding greatdifficulty in carrying the administrative burden and providing themanagerial staff. In fact they have as much work as they can manage.The addition to their responsibilities of so large, difficult and contro-versial a scheme as the Tanganyika groundnuts scheme would inevitablyso increase the burden falling on them as in our view seriously to inter-fere with their proper task of initiating new development projectsthroughout the Colonial Empire.(hi) The absorption of the Overseas Food Corporation by the colonial development Corporation would involve just that change of organisa-tion which we are most anxious to avoid from the point of view of the morale of the staff of the Overseas Food Corporation and the efficientoperation of the scheme. A new Board would almost certainly wish to review the whole basis of the scheme, if only to acquaint themselves withthe nature of the plans; they would have to be given the freedom tomake changes and modifications according to their own views, and thiswould produce further instability.For these reasons we believe that it would be unwise to make the colonial development Corporation responsible for the groundnuts scheme, although weconsider that a link between the two Corporations should be re-established by the revival of the original arrangement under which each Corporation was represented on the Board of the other.28. We, therefore, conclude that the most satisfactory arrangement is a directtransfer of responsibility for the Overseas Food Corporation to the Colonial Office.Their activities should be limited for the present to the conduct of the presentproject, but the legislation should, we think, be so drafted as to make it possible, ,if the Government later so decide, for them to undertake other similar projects in 1East and Central Africa. If this transfer is to be made, it is, of course, desirablethat the necessary legislation should be passed as soon as possible in order thatthe Corporation should not have a further change hanging over it.The Scale of Future Operations29. If our recommendations to continue are approved it is necessary todecide the scale on which the work shall be carried on. We agree with the Board&apos;sproposals for Kongwa and Urambo. No further land clearing is envisaged at eitherplace. There remains to be settled the scale of development in the southern province, where 20,000 acres have already been felled and partly cleared. Thecurrent year&apos;s clearing effort there is just starting. A fully found base has been created at Nachingwea and men and machines are all set to fell 40,000 acres thiswet season. It would be costly to cancel this effort and to pay off the staff for breach of contract. And the feeling that the programme of clearing was to be stoppedwould seriously affect the morale of the staff who are concerned with the agricultural development of the cleared land. The Board of the Corporation and their opinionon this is crucial feel that the abandonment of clearing this year would almostsurely &quot; wreck the scheme.&quot; In view of this we both agree that circumstancescompel the adoption of this year&apos;s felling programme, and, of course, the subsequentcompletion of clearing and preparation of the land for agriculture. Without anyfurther felling this would provide 60,000 acres in the Southern Province.30. The Corporation^ clearing plan proposes the felling of 15,000 acres ineach clearing a year from 1951 to 1957, with a review in 1954. The plan would cost  5,225,000 up to 1957, when 105,000 acres would have been completely clearedand a further 45,000 acres felled. It would cost an additional  2,092,500 to complete the preparation for agriculture of this further felled land, bringing the total costto  7,317,500. This includes the sum of  2,817,500, which would be required inany case to complete the clearing and to establish farms on the land which will havebeen cleared at the end of this season.31. We do not feel it right to ask our colleagues to commit themselves at thisstage to a clearing programme which looks so far ahead as 1957. The Corporationnave themselves proposed a review of future clearing operations in 1954.  If work
were to continue on the basis of their proposals up to 1954 and it were decided in the light of the review then made that no further felling should be done, butthat the land already felled should be cleared and prepared for agriculture, theCorporation would then have 105,000 acres available for agriculture and the totalcost would be  5,067,500 (or  2,250,000 more than the  2,817,500 which, asindicated above, would be required in any case).32. We feel that financial provision should be made to enable the corporation to undertake operations on this latter basis up to 1954. It is not, in fact, necessaryto decide immediately upon the exact scale of future felling for 1951-52 and thetwo subsequent years up to 1954. We would, therefore, prefer to postpone adecision on this until next year, when the Corporation will have had one moreyear&apos;s experience and will be able to review their own proposals in the light of developments meanwhile. As regards felling after 1954, we feel that no commit-ments should be entered into at this stage.The Guarantee of Continuity of Agricultural Operations33. We do not advise our colleagues to commit themselves as far ahead as1957 on the clearing programme. We feel it essential, however, that the corporation should be given an assurance of continuity for their agricultural work. They havesuggested that, for the sake of morale, an assurance should be given that HisMajesty&apos;s Government will guarantee the continuance of agricultural operations for at least seven years. They cannot hope to retain able and responsible membersof their staff unless they are to be allowed a reasonable period in which to test theresults of farming operations. Our advisers are unanimous in feeling that seven years is the minimum period for a reliable test of the economics of farmingoperations, and we recommend that the Board should be given the assurance forwhich they ask. We attach the highest importance to this point.Corporations Inability to Meet its Statutory Commitments34.   The Corporation^ intimation that they are unable to comply with theprovisions of the Overseas Resources Development Act, which requires them to repay advances received from the Government or to pay interest on outstandingadvances (Section 13 (1)) and to secure that their revenues are sufficient to meet allcharges, including the service of their debt, taking one year with another(Section 15 (1)), automatically makes new financial arrangements essential.  TheBoard&apos;s memorandum is a declaration that they will be unable to comply with anydirective which the Minister of Food might give for the repayment of advanceswhich they have had.   This involves the recognition that, with the consent ofParliament, there will.have to be a drastic writing off of lost capital.  Against thiswriting off would be set such sums as might be recovered from the disposal of surplus assets. It might also be possible to revive some of the capital if it is found at the end of a development period that the concern, or some part of it, can payits way.  It is not possible to put a figure on either of these potential credits.  Werecommend, therefore, that authority should be sought to write off the whole ofthe issue up to date at which there is amending legislation. The Exchequer will be credited with any receipts from the disposal of surplus assets as and when they arise.Basis of Further Financial Issues35. It will then be necessary to determine the method by which new issues are made to the Corporation. While there is a hope that some part of the scheme may be able to pay its way at the end of a development period, there is no guarantee that this will be so. It would be unwise, therefore, to introduce any new legislation which provides for issues to be made to the Corporation on the assumption thatin the end there will be a commercial basis of operation. If the Corporation isfreed from any obligation to operate commercially it would be very difficult tojustify to Parliament any different method of providing money other than by Vote.We have accepted this view and we agree that issues should be made by&apos; meansof Votes.The Finance of the New Scheme36. The Ministry of Food have made the best calculation they can from theinformation provided by the Corporation of the probable cost of alternative plans.This is set out in Annex II.   A sum of  5,072,000 is required to meet existing
commitments and the cost of farming operations, headquarters expenditure andcontingencies up to 1953. A further  453,000 is required, mainly for new buildingsto complete development in the Central Region. The immediate felling and clearingeffort in the Southern Province (to complete the 60,000 acres referred to in para-graph 39) will require  2,817,500, and to this will have to be added whatever sum(not exceeding  2,250,000) is required to pay for such felling operations up to 1954as are decided on next year, and for the clearing of this additional land. Thus thetotal expenditure, assuming that the full  2,250,000 is spent, would be  10,592,000.37. In addition it has been recommended in paragraph 33 that continuance ofagricultural operations should be guaranteed for a period of 7 years up to 1957.The Corporation, for obvious reasons, have felt unable to make any forecast of theprobable outcome of agricultural operations after 30th September, 1953. Wecannot at present make any estimate of what sum, if any, may be required for thispurpose.The Queensland-British Food Corporation38. If this transfer of responsibility is accepted, arrangements will have tobe made for the Overseas Food Corporation to be relieved of their responsibility forthe Queensland-British Food Corporation. The capital for the Queensland projecthas been advanced by the Overseas Food Corporation and the Queensland Govern-ment. The Overseas Food Corporation have already made the total contributionto which they are committed to a total contribution of  1 - 5 million. The QueenslandGovernment are committed to contributing  500,000. The development work isalready well advanced. About 480,000 acres of land have been acquired and70,000 acres were under crop this year. Next year it is hoped to plant and harvest100,000 acres and by 1953 the Corporation will have completed their presentagricultural development programme.39. The development of cattle production is proving very successful. they now possess 14,000 head of cattle and are preparing a breeding establishmentwhere they hope to breed 6,000 head of cattle a year. Pig production is proceedingslowly but is not likely to figure large in their future plans.40. It is reasonable to assume that this year the Queensland-British food corporation will make a trading profit. They are thus already well established and are within sight of a time when they will be in a position to meet their capitalcommitments. At present the Board consists of a Chairman, and three membersnominated by the Overseas Food Corporation and a Deputy Chairman nominated by the Queensland Government. Although the Overseas Food Corporation havethe major representation on the Board, it is in fact very difficult for them to exercisemore than a nominal control over an organisation so far away. The drivingforce inevitably comes from the Deputy Chairman who is in Queensland and canthus keep in direct touch with the Corporation^ activities. In these circumstances we feel that there is much to be said in favour of allowing the Queensland Govern-ment to assume full responsibility for the direction of future development. HisMajesty&apos;s Government have every reason to be satisfied with the part which theyhave played in setting on its feet an organisation which, though relatively small,promises well. But their position is that of an investor rather than a prime mover,and the Queensland Government might well be invited, at this stage in theCorporation^ development, to take over full control and financial responsibilityfor the scheme. This is not a scheme which requires investment on the scale of thegroundnut scheme and there seems no reason why arrangements should not bemade for the repayment of the capital invested by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Ifthis course is approved, we should propose, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations, to initiate discussions with the QueenslandGovernment.Recommendations41.   We, therefore, recommend that (a) it should be recognised that the original purpose of the groundnut schemeis no longer capable of fulfilment;(b) in order to make the best use of the assets in East Africa, work should go on and should be based on the need for a development projectdesigned to establish the economics of clearing and large-scale agri-culture ;
(c) the Overseas Food Corporation should be given an undertaking that thecontinuance of agricultural operations for a period of at least 7 years is assured by His Majesty&apos;s Government; y(d) responsibility for the direction of the Overseas Food Corporation shouldbe transferred from the Minister of Food to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies;(e) a decision on the rate of felling in 1951-52 and the two subsequent years should be taken in 1951 and there should be a review of further fellingpolicy in 1954;(/) Parliament be asked to approve the writing off of all money advanced to the Overseas Food Corporation up to the time of its transfer to theSecretary of State for the Colonies, and to provide as required the issueof further funds for the new project;(g) legislation should be introduced as soon as possible to amend the OverseasResources Development Act to implement these decisions;(/?) negotiations should be initiated with the Government of Queensland witha view to transferring responsibility for the direction and financing ofthe Queensland-British Food Corporation to the QueenslandGovernment.J.

ANNEX 1OVERSEAS FOOD CORPORATIONEAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUTS SCHEMEREVISED LONG-TERM plan the revised long-term plan for the East African Groundnut Scheme described in this paper proposes a further drastic reduction in its scope and objectives. TheWhite Paper plan of February, 1947 (Cmd. 7030) proposed the preparation for agriculture of 3,210,000 acres. Of this total 2,400,000 acres were to be in Tanganyikadivided between Kongwa 450,000 acres, Urambo 300,000 acres and the southern province 1,650,000 acres. A further proposal to develop 300,000 acres in kenya and 510,000 acres in Northern Rhodesia was abandoned in the early stages of theScheme. The peak borrowing for the complete Scheme was fixed at  25 million.2. When the Overseas Food Corporation assumed administrative control on1st April, 1948, it was already apparent that the acreage proposed in the white paper plan could not be cleared and developed within the estimated capital expendi-ture. A revised scheme was prepared in 1948 for the clearance of 2,355,000 acresby 1957, involving a peak borrowing of some  66-7 million, a figure which ministers were unable to accept. Further experience in the operation of the Schemeshowed that both land clearing and the establishment of agriculture involved farhigher capital costs than were provided for in the White Paper plan or were estimated in the first instance by the Corporation.3. In September, 1949, a revised plan was submitted to Ministers which was approved and announced in the House of Commons on 21st November, 1949, whichestimated that a total of 600,000 acres could be brought into production in the threedevelopment regions by 1954 for a capital provision, including a reserve foragricultural losses over the earlier years, of  48 million.The finances of the revised plan, as of the White Paper plan, were dependentnot only on the development costs being kept within the estimates, costs which relyto an important degree on the rate of annual development keeping pace with thatassumed in preparing the estimates, but also on the net revenue from agriculture.4. The Kongwa contribution to the total of 600,000 acres was to have been90,000 acres, of which 81,000 acres would be under production. As a result of twoextremely disappointing seasons at Kongwa it was decided, on the recommendationsof the Working Party which studied the position on the spot, to restrict cultivationto 12,000 acres for the next three years.5. The Urambo contribution was also to have been 90,000 acres and the1949/50 development programme was,to clear to that total. There was a delayat the beginning of the season in assembling in Urambo the land clearing resourcesnecessary for this target, principally due to railway services being diverted to therelief of famine, and it soon became evident that 90,000 acres could not be reached in 1949/50. To have maintained the land clearing organisation for a further seasonin order to complete 90,000 acres at Urambo would have involved an additional capital outlay which the Corporation regarded as being unjustified. It was therefore decided to reduce the target to the acreage which could be completed in 1950; a figure estimated at 65,000 acres.6. The major effort was planned for the Southern Province where 420,000acres were to be cleared. The plan provided for the completion of 20,000 acresduring the current season ending November, 1950, the balance of 400,000 acres tobe completed by the end of 1954. Some 20,000 acres will have been felled duringthe 1949/50 season, of which about 7,200 acres will be available for planting by december, 1950. Large scale operations were due to commence in the next season(November, 1950 to November, 1951). Much effort and money have been spent onthe build-up required to support these operations. The object was to create a basecapable of housing and servicing two fully-equipped land clearing teams, and thishas been substantially achieved at a rough cost of  1,400,000. In the meanwhile the work of the Forward Reconnaissance Unit and the Soil Conservation staff was
pushed forward at high pressure in the selection of the soil types suitable for agriculture and the preparation of the land clearing and soil conservation maps.As a result of this close examination of the agricultural potential of the area itemerged that not more than 150,000 acres within an economic radius of Nachingweacould be made available for agriculture. It may be that further investigation intothe productivity of the soils will bring a larger proportion of this area within thescope of cultivation, but this cannot be relied upon. Selective development inaccordance with this survey creates small fields, irregular in shape and of an averagesize of about 1,000 acres each, and separated from one another by natural drainagecourses and areas of unsuitable soil types. Access to them and communications between them called for a much more expensive road construction programme thanthat provided for in the original plan. The nature of the soils made them unusuallyliable to erosion and entailed relatively expensive soil protection measures. Theviews of the Soil Conservation staff, both on soil selection and protective works, asembodied in their development maps for the region, have been confirmed by independent investigation.7. In addition to the restriction of the possible development area and theenhanced cost resulting from these surveys, experience in the clearing of the 20,000acres already felled has shown a higher cost per acre than was provided for in theoriginal plan, to which the greater dispersal of the clearing areas, and the poorperformance of the Shervick tractors, contributed. Performance of the Shervick hasbeen improved, and may well improve still further, but the excessive cost of clearingentirely by mechanical means must be reduced.8. The 1949 plan would have entailed, during the peak years, the simultaneousdeployment of five land-clearing teams, It became evident during 1950 that an effort on this scale was beyond the physical and financial resources of the Corpora-tion, and it was therefore decided to limit the build-up to two land-clearing teams,theoretically capable of clearing and preparing 60,000 acres a year.9. The position described above led the General Manager of the SouthernRegion and his staff to propose a revised plan for the region. This envisaged a reduced annual effort spread over a longer period, namely, ten years, resulting atthe end of that time in a total area prepared for agriculture of about 150,000 acres.It was proposed, as the only means of reducing clearance costs, to substitute handlabour for a part of the operations now done by machinery. The substitution of hand labour eliminates the least efficient and most costly of the mechanicaloperations, those of piling and stumping. The labour estimated to be availablefor this work necessarily reduces the rate of progress to some 15,000-20,000 acresa year.10.   The facts described above, namely:  (a) the loss of 95,000 acres from production at Kongwa and Urambo;(b) the fact that not more than 150,000 acres could be developed in theSouthern Province without the construction of another costly base of operations;(c) the fact that progress cannot be achieved at the rate estimated; and(d) the higher costs of development and land clearing in the Southern Regionthan had been estimated;meant that the 600,000-acre plan could not be carried out within the existingborrowing powers of the Corporation, particularly if adequate sums were to be reserved to meet the liabilities, all of them non-revenue earning, which necessarilyfall on the Corporation as a result of the drastic scaling down of the Scheme ascompared with that for which provision had been made in the attempt to execute the original White Paper plan. The Corporation considered that, in view of theresults so far achieved, and the problems which still remain to be solved, no justifica-tion could be found for proposing any increase in their present borrowing powersand felt it incumbent upon them to put forward a revised plan which is capableof being carried out, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, within the  50 million of long-term capital authorised by the Overseas Resources Development Act.11. The revised long-term plan now submitted accords, therefore, with theconclusions which the Corporation consider must inevitably be drawn from the
facts which have emerged during the operation of the Scheme to date and the factswith which it is now faced. The position as they see it is this:  (A) The attempt to produce crops economically on land which has been clearedfor agriculture at a great cost in money and human effort must be sustained for a sufficiently long period to show conclusive results. Thisperiod they regard as being a minimum of seven years.(B) The areas selected for development are capable of giving good yields ofgroundnuts and have done so on the small experimental farms. Theproblem, which has yet to be solved, is to reproduce these results, orsomething approaching them, on a field scale. The groundnut is not aplant which lends itself readily to mass methods over vast acreages.The attainment of economic yields demands intensive farming. the conception of 30,000 acre units with a thin spread of Europeansupervision and of machinery has proved unworkable and must bereplaced by much smaller farms of 1,500 to 6,000 acres independentlyfarmed by men who can gain an intimate knowledge of the peculiaritiesof the land on their own farms; peculiarities which vary from farmto farm.(C) The clearing of forest and bush from land of the type occupied by theCorporation by wholly mechanical means has proved impracticablewithin either the time or the cost envisaged in previous plans.Mechanical clearing can be done, but it cannot be done at an economiccost in relation to the value of the arable land created. Simpler andslower methods must be substituted for a part of the mechanicaltechnique so far employed in order to reduce these costs.(D) Communications, installations, machines and man-power have been built up over the past three years for a major land-clearing operation in theSouthern Province due to commence in December 1950. It would bewasteful not to utilise this accumulation of resources at least for amaximum tree-felling effort (the most efficient and economical of themechanised operations) during the coming wet season.(E) Provision must be made from the capital which remains at the disposalof the Corporation to cover commitments, mainly nugatory, which result from the past and to provide some reserve margin for the unforeseencontingencies which will inevitalby arise during the execution of anyrevised plan.12. Acting on these conclusions the Corporation has formulated a plan designedto attain, within their statutory borrowing powers, the following broad objectives: -(A) To establish, by agricultural practices and scientific experiments, a pattern of agriculture which will utilise economically all the cleared landavailable and which, if successful, will point the way to future develop-ment.(B) To equip all the cleared land with permanent installations and adequatemachinery and implements without which the capital expenditure on land clearing will be wasted.(C) To execute in the Southern Province the first stage, extending to 1957, ofwhat may become as the result of a later review of the economic prospects, a plan to develop the total area (i.e., 150,000 acres) capableof being serviced from Nachingwea and to utilise to this end the installations, machinery and man-power already accumulated; thealternative being to disband an organisation built up for the purposeover the past three years.(D) To provide for all present and future liabilities so far as they can before seen.(E) To establish that sense of permanence and stability without which noconstructive objective can be achieved efficiently.In the case of agriculture, estimates of costs and revenue have been providedfor the first three seasons only, that is to 30th September, 1953. This is becausethe Corporation regard it as unrealistic to frame detailed estimates of farm costs and detailed predictions of crops, yields and prices over a longer period than three years or to anticipate the changes in farming organisation and technique and in croprotations which may result from the experiments now in progress.   Nevertheless
they regard an assured future for agricultural production over a minimum periodof seven years as essential to eventual success, and if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare unable to give such an assurance the Corporation would regard any further capital expenditure as of doubtful justification. Annual reports and budgets,prepared after a detailed appraisal of the progress of the Scheme from year to year,would, of course, be submitted. It must be remembered, however, that an attempt is being made to establish a new pattern of farming in areas where farming, otherthan primitive African agriculture, has not hitherto been practised. If the Schemeis to be subject to periodical re-examinations such as bring its whole future intoquestion, then the Corporation would see little prospect of establishing (once the drastic reduction and reorganisation planned for the coming year has beencompleted) that stability and coherence in its operations which the. Corporationregard as vital to success. The plan makes prudent provision for agricultural losses and unforeseen contingencies. The Corporation consider, moreover, that the costs as now estimated can be reduced in time. As a result of their own investigationsand of the best advice that they can obtain, the Corporation are satisfied that theprospects of success, and the advantages to African development which would flow from it, justify such risks as may be involved in a seven-years&apos; commitment and theyadvise that such a commitment should be accepted. In doing so they are veryconscious that the new plan cannot in itself contribute significantly towards BritauYsfood supplies. The acreages under crop during the three-year period will be no more than are shown in the following table, and the best that can now be hoped forwithin the borrowing powers of the Corporation is 250,000 to 300,000 acres availablefor production in some form.Acreages Under CropSouthernKongwa       Urambo       Province       Total1950-51     ...      12,450 45,000 7,200 64,6501951-52     ...      12,450 45,000 16,800 74,2501952-53     ...      12,450 45,000 24,000 81,450Approximately 50 per cent, of the acreage would be under groundnuts, the balancebeing, for the present, maize, sorghum and millet.Disappointing as these results may be, the Corporation regard the scheme as being capable, on the scale which they propose, of making what may become a significant contribution towards the hitherto unsolved problem of convertingunoccupied but potentially productive areas of Colonial Africa into food-producingregions. Tanganyika Territory itself has yet to become self-sufficient in food.13.   In broad outline the revised plan includes (A) Provision for crop production on an acreage commencing at 64,650 acres in the year ending 30th September, 1951, rising to 81,450 acres in theyear ending 30th September, 1953.(B) The equipment of the land completed for agriculture with the installations,buildings, electricity, water supplies, plant, machinery, vehicles andtools essential for agricultural production.(C) The utilisation of the resources now accumulated in Nachingwea for amaximum tree-felling effort in the coming season, which should resultin the clearance of some 40,000 acres; thereafter, i.e., from June 1951to 30th September, 1957, operations will be reduced to such annualacreage as can be achieved by a permanent force, fixed at thirty tractors,assisted by hand labour. Thirty tractors, plus the labour force estimated to be available for this work, which is the limiting factor, would providefor a balanced and uniform annual effort. The acreage made availablefor agriculture annually by these methods should be of the order of15,000 acres.(D) Provision for commitments which arise from the reduction in scale of previous plans, which include guarantees given in respect of port,railway and oil tank construction, running down and maintenanceexpenses and compensation to employees for loss of office.(E) Reserve provision for accumulated depreciation liabilities and unforeseencontingencies.
14. The plan is explained in detail in subsequent sections and the financial implications are set out in a financial statement appended to this paper. Undermain headings the estimated financial provision required is as follows:   (A) To meet farming costs to the 30th September, 1953,including all administrative overheads and a depreciationprovision for all assets utilised, less anticipated revenue from crops...................... 760,000(B) Capital expenditure    ..................        5,960,000 (C) Provision for past commitments     ...      ...      2,660,000Less: the estimated net receipts from sale of surplus stores and equipment        ...      2,250,000410,000(D) Depreciation and contingency reserves     .........       1,370,0008,500,000ADD : Estimated expenditure to 31st March, 1951     ......      36,500,00045,000,00015. The borrowing powers of the Corporation under the Overseas resources development Act of 1948 are  50,000,000 on long-term plus  5,000,000 for short-term advances. A total of  2,000,000 has been invested in, or earmarked for, theQueensland-British Food Corporation and it is proposed to earmark a further 500,000. It is therefore possible for the Corporation to borrow a further 2,500,000 of long-term capital before the statutory limit is reached. The Corpora-tion would propose to borrow this amount if necessary as a further geenral reserve.SECTION II:  THE REGIONSKongwaDevelopment16. No further capital expenditure is proposed other than the small amountsrequired for cropjstorage and the completion of works which it would be uneconomicnot to finish.Agriculture17. The agricultural organisation in Kongwa for the next three years will bethat recently decided by the Corporation and the Government on the recommenda-tions of the Kongwa Working Party. Regional Headquarters are being abolishedforthwith. Three farms have been established of a gross area of 12,000, 6,000 and3,000 acres respectively, one-half of which will be under crop. The maximumauthority is being given to each Farm Manager, who will be directly responsible to the new General Manager, Central Regions. (Vide paragraph 26.) A fourthfarm of about 1,500 acres under crop has been established under the control of the scientific Department and the Operational Research Unit, in order to give themwider scope to try out on a field scale their experience gained on the purely experi-mental farms, which will be continued.The object is to conduct fully-costed field scale trials for a period of three years,commencing with the next planting season in December 1950, after which a furtherview will be taken, depending on the success achieved, of the possibility of againextending arable agriculture over some or all of the remainder of the cleared land.Meanwhile, to preserve the cleared area and to gain new experience, ranchingon a small scale will be gradually extended. Cattle will also be introduced into thenew farms.UramboDevelopment18. As explained in paragraph 5, the clearing programme for Urambo hasbeen reduced to 65,000 acres, which it was estimated could be completed during
the 1950 season. Some 50,000 acres will be completed by November, the remaining15,000 acres taking three or four months longer. Further capital expenditure isnecessary to equip new land with installations, stores, farm buildings and implementsand for providing a minimum of permanent buildings for Urambo Headquarterswhich at present consists in the main of temporary structures. The total capitalexpenditure required to complete Urambo as a production area of some 60,000 acres(which excludes 5,000 acres required for soil conservation works) is estimated at 410,000.Agriculture19. Benefiting from experience in Kongwa, the farming of the completed land has been reorganised for the next planting season into two main administrative units,comprising:  Unit No. 1.   Six farms, ranging from 3,300 acres to 5,500 acres with oneof 1,700 acres^andUnit No. 2. Seven farms of 1,500 acres each and four of 5,000 acres.Each farm will be a self-contained and responsible entity. The selection of theseacreages is dictated in part by topographical reasons but it is also designed to assist in establishing by trial, on a sufficiently large scale to be dependable, what is themost economic farming unit.The cropping programme comprises groundnuts, maize and sorghum, Theyields taken for estimating purposes are:  1950-51     1951-52     1952-53lb. lb. lb.Groundnuts, kernels......        600 650 700Maize............      1,000 1,200 1,400Sorghum       ......      ...      1,000 1,200 1,300Financial provision is made in the plan to cover farming losses in Urambo upto 30th September, 1953. It is impossible to predict with accuracy what the resultswill be over so large a new estate, or how long it may take before production overthe whole area becomes self-supporting. Success will depend on improving farmingefficiency to the point at which the results obtained on experimental farms can bereproduced on a larger scale and the speed with which supplementary crops,particularly tobacco, can be developed experimentally and themselves beestablished on the farm scale.A tobacco plot of 100-120 acres farmed by two experienced tobacco growers isbeing commenced this year.Area Headquarters are being retained, but on a greatly reduced scale; some services (workshops and hospitals) being shared with Kongwa.20. The Corporation are satisfied that the prospects of eventual success are sufficiently encouraging to justify the three years&apos; production programme at Urambowhich they recommend.Southern RegionDevelopment21. The considerations set out in paragraph 6 to 9, namely that not more than150,000 acres of suitable land is at present available for development without theconstruction of a new base of operations; that resources equivalent to nearly twoland-clearing teams have already been assembled; that fully mechanised land clearingis far too costly and could be reduced by substituting hand labour and that thesubstitution of hand labour requires a longer cycle of operations, lead&apos; the Cor-poration to submit the following recommendations:  (A) An all out felling effort during the coming wet season (December, 1950 to april 1951) within the resources now in Nachingwea; and(B) The reduction of the mechanised effort, as from June 1951, to a force of thirty operational tractors. Commencing with the reserve of felled landin hand resulting from (A), this force would follow up the subsequenthand operations by root cutting preparatory to agriculture, whilecarrying out at the same time a restricted programme of new felling.This has been provided for in the plan up to 30th September, 1957. TheCorporation is satisfied that the most effective means of securing economical
land clearing is to organise a compact and manageable mechanical force, assisted by hand labour, to be employed over a fixed period of reasonable length ratherthan to work to a predetermined target of acreage. This form of organisation would give a stability and coherence to the operations which cannot be provided,even at this stage, in any other way. The acreages which it is estimated should becompleted by the end of 1957 are 105,000 acres fully cleared for agriculture and35,000 to 45,000 acres in various stages of preparation. A view can be taken in1954 in the light of agricultural and land-clearing experience to that date as towhether or not it would be economic to complete the development of the 150,000acres available; an operation which would extend to 1960 or 196.1. If the decision is against doing so then the clearing programme can be suitably adjusted. the sequence of operations would be:  (A) Felling by the chain method, which is the only mechanised operation whichcan be described as efficient and economical.(B) Burning the felled trees, stumping and twig picking by hand.(C) Root cutting by tractor-drawn heavy disc ploughs or other implement.Experiments designed to reduce the excessive cost of this final operation are still in progress.22. Capital expenditure to complete the equipment of the area for agricultural production is provided in the plan. Including the land clearing programme described above, with surveys and soil conservation works, installations, &amp;c, the total capitalrequired over the seven years&apos; period is estimated at  5,225,000.Agriculture23. The agricultural aspect of the Southern Region scheme has been closelyexamined by a Corporation committee, which included Mr. G. F. Clay (AgriculturalAdviser to the Secretary of State for the Colonies), Mr. Frank Sykes (a widelyexperienced English farmer, who is also interested in African agriculture and is amembers of the Colonial Agricultural Advisory Committee), together with repre-sentatives of the Tanganyika Government. The evidence given to this Committeeand their own observations and discussions led them to conclude that the SouthernRegion is capable of giving good yields of groundnuts; that there is no reason whygood yields of maize should not be obtained but that this remains to be proved;that cotton and tobacco should be developed experimentally and that, if successful,these two crops would much improve the economic outlook. They saw seriousfarming problems ahead owing to difficulties in soil management which could be overcome by good farming, and in the high seasonal demands for power and labour,which would remain a permanent disadvantage. Nevertheless, the Committeeregarded the eventual prospects as being sufficiently favourable to justify theCorporation proceeding with the agricultural development of the cleared land.Farms in this region are being organised for the present into 3,000 acres each, ofwhich 2,400 acres should be under crop each year. Seven such farms are beingopened in the coming season but it is unlikely that more than 7,200 acres will be under crop; they will come into full production the following year. It is estimatedthat 105,000 acres will be opened to agriculture by the end of 1957.Pending the successful development of supplementary crops production will begroundnuts, maize and millet. The following yields have been taken for estimatingpurposes:  1950-51   1951-52 1952-53lbs. lbs. lbs.Groundnuts, kernels        ......      600 600 700Maize         ............    1,000 1,000 1,100Millet         ............      600 600 600SECTION III: LONDON AND NAIROBI OFFICES AND east african HEADQUARTERS24. The administrative organisation necessary to execute the run down ofthe present scale of operations to that now planned will be little less, in the firstinstance,- than the one required to build it up. The London Office has a present strength of all types, from Members to messengers, of about 170, which will bereduced to seventy by the end of 1953.
&apos; 25. Nairobi is the trading and transport centre of East Africa,, and it will benecessary to keep a small Agency staff there to control local purchases and operate the air transport contract between the Corporation and the British Overseas airways corporation. This Agency will be brought under the control of the London Officewhen local decentralisation is complete.26. The Central Headquarters at Kongwa consists at present of seventeendepartments with a strength of 150 Europeans and an expenditure at the rate of 270,000 per annum. It is proposed rapidly to reduce this Headquarters in strengthand scope by a combined process of decentralisation and abolition. The process hasalready started and will be accelerated throughout the three year period to september, 1953, when the strength is expected to be eleven, at an annual cost ofabout  40,000. The Headquarters will cease to be executive by 1st January, 1951(except in the field of finance), and will later be replaced by a team of four advisers(agriculture, engineering, labour and finance) with seven assistants, including office staff. Executive authority will be wholly decentralised to two Regional general managers (one for the Central Region of Urambo and Kongwa and one for theSouthern Region) who will be responsible direct to the Board in London. the advisers will have the right and duty to advise the General Managers and the Boardand to enforce reference to the Board at their discretion. The virtual disbandment of the Kongwa Headquarters will leave surplus buildings on the Corporation^hands. Means of turning these buildings to good use are being discussed with the Tanganyika Government. Arrangements are in hand to take private patients in thehospital and undertake outside work in the workshop in order to utilise installationswhich have now become too large for the Corporation^ requirements.SECTION IV:   STAFF27. The European staff at present employed in East Africa by the Corpora-tion and by Earthmoving and Construction, Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary), andthe numbers expected to remain over the three years is given in the followingtable:-Present      As at      As at      As atStrength   30/9/51 30/9/52 30/9/53O.F.C..........      1,283 888 778 609E.M.C. ...      ...      ...        384 301,667 918*       778*       609*It will be seen that the reductions are severe, although they are not more than is necessary if the Scheme is to be brought within the limits of finance which the revised plan allows. Great disappointment and much personal hardship is boundto be caused in the course of carrying out these reductions. The employees of the overseas Food Corporation will receive compensation on retirement of six months&apos;salary or four months&apos; salary plus the earned leave due to them, whichever is thegreater, and this implements the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Food in the House of Commons on 17th July, 1950. A reserve of  400,000 is included to cover these liabilities. The case of Earthmoving and construction, Ltd., is different in that their employees were engaged on fixed period contracts suited to the more temporary nature of their employment witha contracting company. They will be dealt with in accordance with the terms oftheir individual contracts.The selection of the Corporation^ staff to remain on the Scheme is beingcarefully carried out by an impartial Board and every effort is being made toensure that the claims of all are dealt with fairly.28. In the case of African staff of skilled types, i.e., clerks, tractor drivers andmechanics, a considerable scope for their employment will still remain and thosewho have increased their skill and improved their competence should for the mostpart find a future under the revised plan. Owing to the expansion of agricultureand the substitution of hand labour for machines in the land clearing operations,the demand for unskilled labour will remain high. In any case, it is not thegeneral custom of African unskilled labour to remain in continuous employment and as there is an ample demand for such labour throughout Tanganyika nohardship should arise.* These figures exclude staff employed in the disposal of surplus plant, stores and equipment.
SECTION V: COMMITMENTS AND RESERVESRailway Guarantees29. It was decided in 1947 to construct a deep-water port at Mtwara witha railway through to Nachingwea. Owing to the time required to complete theport, and the first section of the railway to Ruo, a temporary port was constructedat Mkwaya, near Lindi, and connected to the projected main line at Ruo whichwas continued forward to Nachingwea and opened to traffic from Mkwaya inOctober 1949. The East African Railways and Harbours Administration agreedto provide the capital for these works from a projected East African TransportLoan subject to a guarantee from the Corporation of any shortfall in interest and sinking fund not covered by port and railway earnings; this undertaking to be reviewed after ten years. The guarantee was subsequently extended by the Cor-poration to cover any deficiency in operating costs. This port and railway construction was, of course, undertaken in relation to the estimated traffic, bothinwards and outwards, which would have resulted from the execution of the originalWhite Paper plan (Cmd. 7030). Transport requirements on the scale of development to which the original plan has now been reduced deprive these port and railwayworks of any prospect of becoming economic on the Corporation^&quot;traffic alone, andthe Corporation has already stated to the Ministry of Food that so far as then-own requirements are concerned the completion of the Mtwara Port and the railsection from Mtwara to Ruo is unnecessary, and that, if for other reasons it is the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Government to proceed, the obligations of the Corporation. should be restricted to its inescapable liabilities as at, say, the 31st December, 1950,It is impossible at this stage to assess with accuracy the liabilities which may fallon the Corporation in respect of these railway guarantees; the sum of  1,250,000has been set aside on their account.Oil Company Guarantees30. An oil pipeline was laid from Mtwara to a tank centre beyond Nachingweaat the cost of the Corporation as part of the Southern Region development. Theline was completed in 1949. The Shell Company of East Africa, Limited, provided the ocean installation at Mtwara into which oil tankers discharge and a handlinginstallation at the inland terminal. An agreement was made between the Cor-poration and the Company under which the Corporation agreed to pay to theCompany depreciation and interest on these installations incurred over a five-year period to the extent that the quantity of oil passing through them fell short of an agreed figure of 100,000 tons over the period; this figure being substantially less thanthe estimates of consumption given to the Company when they agreed to incur the capital expenditure.Under the present reduced plan it is unlikely that consumption will exceed5,000 tons per annum. A reserve of  220,000 is made to cover liability on this account and on account of a similar arrangement covering a ten-year period madein respect of oil installations provided by the Company at Kongwa and Urambo.Running Down and Maintenance Expenses31. The reduction in the scale of agricultural operations at Kongwa for whichroads, buildings, plant and a large hospital and workshop have been providedentails maintenance and operation expenditure on a scale which cannot fairly becharged against the farming of 12,000 acres. It is, nevertheless, necessary to main-tain these installations in case the results over the next three years should justify a subsequent expansion. The sum of  295,000 has been provided over the period to cover these costs.32. At Kongwa, Urambo and Nachingwea the Corporation finds itself withequipment and stores far in excess of its future requirements, and it is also facedwith special non-recurring costs in running down the scale of the organisation; costs which cannot properly be charged to current expenses. A provision of  495,000has been made.33. The total sum reserved to cover the expenditure described above and thecompensation due to redundant staff is  2,660,000, against which a recovery isestimated in respect of surplus stores and equipment of not less than  2,250,000.The net provision for meeting commitments arising from the past is thus  410,000.
Reserves34. A reserve of  370,000 is proposed to cover the accrued depreciation onassets as at 31st March, 1951, which are required for the revised plan.35.   A sum of  1,000,000 is to be set aside to cover unforeseen contingencies.SECTION VI: PROBLEMS OUTSTANDING36. Apart from the task of executing the agricultural and developmentproposals of the revised plan described in this paper, the Corporation is now facedwith three major problems.37. The first is to dispose of the physical and contractual legacies of the past,accumulated on a scale commensurate with the activities authorised in Cmd. 7030,but greatly in excess of present requirements. This is a major undertaking andis likely to last at least for the next two years. An organisation has been establised for the disposal of surplus stores, plant, machinery and equipment. Other pastcontractual obligations (described in Section V) will be settled as soon as is possible.38. The second problem is to devise some method whereunder the activitiesof the future are not burdened with overheads representing the cost of presentsurpluses, whether of stores, plant, installations, buildings or man-power. This is primarily a financial question and is capable of settlement as such.39. The third problem is morale. Many hundreds of the Corporation^personnel will be redundant to the Scheme during the next twelve months nearly,40 per cent, of the total strength. Suitable terms of compensation (described inparagraph 27) are being offered to them on their departure and every effort willbe made to place them in contact with other employment in England and In Tanganyika. This is all that the Corporation can do for them. For those whoremain on the Scheme, however, something must be done to restore their confidence in the future. The Corporation has made clear its views that the only effective action that can now be taken is for the Minister to give an assurance that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have every intention of seeing the Scheme through on thebasis of the present proposals for at least the next seven years.40. The revised plan covers the Groundnut Scheme only. The Corporationdo not contemplate embarking on any other schemes in East Africa or elsewhere.They may, however, undertake joint surveys along with the Tanganyika Govern-ment for other areas in the Territory from which pilot schemes may result.41. Although no direction has been received from the Minister underSection 13 (1) of the Overseas Resources Development Act, 1948, to make repay-ments of advances received from the Government, or of interest on outstandingadvances, it is evident that the Corporation have not been, and are not, in aposition to make such payments. It is too early to judge to what extent, if any,the agricultural activities of the Corporation will in due course be able to bearinterest and amortisation charges, but sooner or later considerable capital adjust-ments will clearly be necessary.42. The Corporation consider that, given freedom from natural calamity,their agriculture ought in time (not necessarily within the seven-year period ofthe plan) to pay its way and cover its future overheads and the depreciation on the assets retained for use. They see no prospect, however, of fulfilling the obligations of Section 15 (1) of the Act, which requires them to secure that their revenues are sufficient to meet all charges, including the service of their debt, taking one year with another from the inception of the Scheme.The Corporation feel it incumbent upon them to bring to notice their inability to comply with the requirements of the Act in these matters. It is for consideration whether it would not be appropriate to promote amending legislation in this behalf.43. Detailed estimates and schedules covering the revised plan have been rendered to the Ministry of Food, together with the report on agriculture in theSouthern Province referred to in paragraph 23. A Financial Statement is attached.(Signed) ERIC COATES, Chairman.London, 15th November, 1950.

The totalcost of a plan which included the clearing of 105,000 acres in the Southern Provincewould be  10,592,500 while the total cost of the Corporation^ full plan which involves the clearing of 150,000 acres in the Southern Province would be  12,842,500.5. Apart from development expenditure no allowance is made for any agri-cultural losses and other contingencies from September 1953 to 1957. It is recom-mended in paragraph 34 of our memorandum that the continuance of agriculturaloperations should be guaranteed for a period of seven years up to 1957, but it isnot possible to make any estimate of what allowance, if any, would be necessary forthis. On the other hand no credit has been taken for the receipts from disposal of surplus stores and equipment. The Corporation have assumed that  2,250,000(two-thirds of which is an allowance for stores which they will use themselves) willbe obtained from this source.
&apos; ANNEX IIIPRELIMINARY DRAFT WHITE PAPER ONTHE FUTURE OF THE OVERSEAS FOOD CORPORATION1. The Overseas Food Corporation have submitted a revised plan for thefuture work of the East African Groundnut Scheme to the Minister of Food.This plan (which is set out in the Appendix to this paper*) has been considered 1by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The original aims of the scheme have provedincapable of fulfilment. That is not to say, however, that the scheme andthe work which has been done on it are now valueless and should be abandoned: on the contrary, His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that it is stillof importance, although a new conception of its objectives is necessary. It willbe continued as an experimental development project under the direction ofthe Secretary of State for the Colonies and revised arrangements will be madefor the financing of the scheme.Original Plan for the Production of Groundnuts2. The plan, approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the productionof groundnuts in East Africa was based on the recommendations of a Missionwhich visited Tanganyika and other African territories in 1946. The Mission&apos;sreport and the Governmenfs decision to embark upon a scheme based on therecommendations contained in their report were published in February 1947(Cmd. 7030).3. Work in East Africa began under the direction of the United AfricaCompany, Ltd., acting as Managing Agents for the Minister of Food, on whomresponsibility was placed for carrying out the scheme. In accordance withthe published intention of the Government responsibility for the direction ofthe scheme was subsequently transferred to a public Corporation. The Over-seas Food Corporation, established under the Overseas Resources development act, 1948, became responsible for the East African Groundnut Scheme on1st March, 1948, and a month later assumed control of the day-to-day management of work in Tanganyika.4. The plan on which work began envisaged the clearing by 1953 of3,250,000 acres of bush in East and Central Africa and an annual productionof groundnuts after that date of about 600,000 tons. The total capitalexpenditure involved was estimated at approximately  24 million. The schemewas recognised to be a pioneering venture in large-scale mechanised agricultureunder tropical conditions, without precedent and open to great risks. But theadvice of many responsible people consulted at the time gave His Majesty&apos;sGovernment grounds for believing that a programme of mechanised landclearing and agricultural operations on the lines suggested by the Mission stooda reasonable chance of success. It was intended that the plan should be subjectto continuous review in the light of fresh information gathered as the workprogressed, and, where necessary, re-cast or modified.5. A progress report published in January 1948 (Cmd. 7314) explainedthat the first year&apos;s work had fallen behind schedule. But some of the majordifficulties which have since been experienced by the Overseas Food corporation had not at that stage been encountered and it was still thought that the clearingand cultivation of land on the broad lines and within the time schedule set outin Command 7030 could be accomplished.Modification of the Plan6. Further and more formidable difficulties, both in clearing bush and inmechanised cultivation of the cleared land led to a revision of the originalplan to clear 3,250,000 acres. Not only did the annual clearing and planting programme suggested in Command 7030 prove to be beyond the Corporation^physical capabilities, but the cost of land clearing was found to be very muchgreater than had been estimated. In the light of the knowledge and experiencewhich they had gained up to that time, the Overseas Food Corporation sub-mitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the autumn of 1949 a revised programmeof development which they considered could be carried out within the resources available to them. This programme, which envisaged the clearing of600,000 acres of bush by 1954, was accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand announced to Parliament by the Minister of Food on 26th November, 1949.The Overseas Food Corporations proposals. Experience of another year of bush clearing and a second harvestseason has led the Overseas Food Corporation to revise and modify still furthertheir development programme. They now regard the clearing of 600,000 acres of bush by 1954 as impracticable. They have accordingly submitted to theMinister of Food a revised plan of development. Their submission is attached as an Appendix* to this paper.* See Annex I
8. The corporation^ new proposals cover a seven-year period up to 1957.They envisage no further&apos; development at Kongwa or Urambo after the end&apos;of this year. The proposals for Kongwa, which are based on the Report ofthe Kongwa Working Party, have already been announced. Of the clearedarea of 90,000 acres, 24,000 acres are to be set aside for agriculture, of which12,000 acres will be under crop each year. The remainder of the cleared land will be available for grazing. The object is to conduct fully costed field scaletrials on a limited acreage for a period of three years. A further review will then be made, in the light of the results achieved, of the possibility of againextending arable agriculture over some or all of the remainder of the clearedland.9. Clearing will end at Urambo by the end of thjs year. Although bushhas been felled on 65,000 acres, it is not expected that more than 50,000 acreswill be available for agriculture for the harvest of 1951. 60,000 acres willbe farmed in subsequent years.10. In the Southern Province some 20,000 acres have been felled, of which7,000 acres will be available for agriculture for the 1951 harvest. During thecurrent wet season, with the two land clearing teams built up for that purpose,a further 40,000 acres are being felled. Thereafter the Corporation proposedrastically to reduce the tractor force and to adopt a slower and cheaper methodof land clearing involving the substitution of hand labour for part of the work at present done by machines. Under this scheme it is proposed that subsequentfelling should be limited to 15,000 acres of land per year and the Corporationexpect to bring the same acreage into cultivation each year. By 1957 theyplan to have 105,000 acres fully cleared for agriculture and a further45,000 acres in various stages of preparation.11. An important feature of the revised scheme is that instead of farmingunits of 30,000 acres as originally proposed, all three areas will, with one exception at Kongwa, be farmed in units not exceeding 6,000 acres underintensive supervision by men who can gain an intimate knowledge of thepeculiarities of the land which they farm.12. In submitting their proposals the Corporation have emphasised theneed for continuity of agricultural operations in the interests both of efficiency and of the morale of the staff, which has suffered from past uncertainties and changes of plan. The Corporation have indeed stated that they regard an assured future of agricultural production over a minimum period of seven years as essential to the eventual success of the scheme.13. The proposals have been considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government,who regard the reasons given by the Corporation for the modification of theexisting scheme as conclusive. Subject to what follows, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have accepted the revised plan. They are convinced that the Corporationare right in seeking a guarantee of continuity of agricultural production andit is their firm intention that funds should be provided to enable farmingoperations to continue for seven years the minimum period within which toestablish a system of rotation and to test the economics of farming. Develop-ment work in the Southern Province will proceed up to 1954 on the clearingof the 40,000 acres being felled during the present wet season. But a decision as to the exact rate of additional felling in the wet seasons of 1951-52 andthe subsequent two years will not be taken until next year. The corporation have themselves proposed that there should be a review in 1954, in the lightof agricultural and land-clearing experience, to determine what further fellingand clearing should take place after that date. His Majesty&apos;s government consider that this is a wise proposal and that it would be unrealistic to accept any commitment at this stage for the further development of the southern province beyond 30th September, 1954. But this does not in any sense affectthe view that there should be a firm commitment for the continuance ofagricultural operations up to 1957 on the land cleared.Nature of the Scheme_ 14. The acceptance of the revised programme submitted by the overseas food Corporation involves a radical change in the whole conception of thescheme. The original aim was to increase production of oils and fats tomeet a world shortage which was, and still is, expected to persist. It was hopedthat within a comparatively short time the scheme would make a substantial contribution to world supplies. This hope has not been fulfilled and, whilethe possibility remains that in time Tanganyika may contribute to world oils and fats supplies, the Corporation^ proposals show that too much has yet to be learned about meth6ds of land clearing and large-scale mechanisedagriculture in Tanganyika to give any grounds for supposing that rapid development over wide areas is at present practicable.15. The scheme must now be regarded as a scheme of large-scale experi-mental development to establish the economics of clearing and mechanisedagriculture under tropical conditions. His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered whether on this new basis the continuance of the scheme is justified;
they have had no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that it is. One of themain purposes of the original scheme was to increase the productivity of tanganyika and raise the standard of living of its people. Even on the modified basis now proposed the scheme cannot fail to be an important contribution to the economic prosperity of the territory. It would not be justifiable to allow the considerable acreages of hitherto unusable land whichthe Corporation has already made available for agriculture and pasture to revert to bush. In the long run enough food to meet the workTs needs withexpanding populations and rising standards of living can only be produced by bringing into cultivation, by new and more efficient methods of agriculture,land which has hitherto been uneconomical to develop. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have undertaken as members of the Food and Agriculture organisation to share in efforts designed to increase world food supplies and they are con-vinced that it is incumbent on them, in accordance with their international obligations, to continue the experiment which has been started with a view to determining whether hitherto unproductive bush can be developed for pro-ductive purposes. The abandonment of the present scheme to which so much money and effort have been devoted, at a time when techniques are beginning to develop which may in due course prove fruitful, would be a retrograde step which His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be prepared to take.16. The change in the nature of the scheme has caused His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to reconsider the arrangements whereby the Minister of Food is charged with responsibility for its supervision. This arrangement was appro-priate when the plan was that of large-scale poduction of oilseeds on acommercial basis. But now that it has become primarily a colonial develop-ment project to determine the economics of clearing and mechanised agriculture in Tanganyika, it is proper for the responsibility to pass to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies. Legislation to amend the Overseas resources development Act will be introduced to enable this change to be made during1951. In the meanwhile, until the formalities of transfer have been completedthere will be the same close consultation with the Secretary of State for theColonies on all questions of policy affecting the Corporation as there has beenin the past. In order to ensure that the Tanganyika Government should alsobe fully associated with the operation of the scheme, arrangements are beingmade for that Government to be represented on the Board of the Corporation.Queensland^British Food Corporation17. It is not considered appropriate for the Overseas Food corporation to retain, after that date, partial control of the Queensland-British food corporation, which is at present its subsidiary company. When the time comesfor Parliament to consider the transfer of responsibility for the Overseas food corporation to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will propose alternative arrangements for the control of the Queensland-British Food Corporation.The Port of Mtwara18. When the East African groundnuts scheme was first considered itwas recognised that the most promising area for development was situated inthe Southern Province. But since the site chosen was nearly 100 milesfrom the sea it was not possible for bush clearing to begin until communicationshad been established. It was decided that, although a railway connecting thedevelopment area to a temporary landing hard at Mkwaya on the Lindi Creekwould suffice while development was in its early stages, a more adequate portwould later be necessary. The Millbourn Report recommended the construc-tion of a deep-water berth port suitable for ocean-going vessels at Mtwara. Thisrecommendation was accepted and work on the new port has been proceeding.The railway connecting the development area to Mkwaya was completed andopened on 25th October, 1949. The railway connection between Mtwaraand this line is under construction.19. Under the revised plan proposed by the Overseas Food corporation the development in the Southern Province of Tanganyika will be on a muchmore limited scale than was originally intended and the expected volume ofCorporation traffic is correspondingly reduced. On the basis of the new plan the Corporation do not consider that their needs, if taken alone, would justifythe completion of the new port of Mtwara. But the Tanganyika Governmenthas decided to undertake an intensive development plan in the southern province which, over a period, will substantially increase other export and import traffic over the railway. The Tanganyika Government intends to spendsubstantial sums in constructing and improving feeder roads, while the east african Railways and Harbours Administration proposes to extend the railway60 miles westward from the groundnut area under guarantee by the TanganyikaGovernment, subject to the approval of the Legislative Council. - This isintended as the first stage of a westward extension of the railway to LakeNyasa. In the light of these decisions by the Tanganyika Government andthe East African Railways and Harbours Administration the Corporation
have agreed that the port of Mtwara and the railway connecting it with theexisting line should be completed. His Majesty&apos;s Government are convincedthat this conclusion is right and they have indicated to the Tanganyika Govern-ment and the East African Railways and Harbours Administration that theywarmly welcome the forward development policy being pursued.Finance20. The Corporation have reported that they are unable to comply withthe provisions of the Overseas Resources Development Act which require themto operate on a commercial basis, and to repay advances made to them fromthe Consolidated Fund. Parliamentary authority will, therefore, be sought for the amendment of the financial arrangements appertaining to the Cor-poration, including the writing off of all money advanced to the Corporationup to the time of its transfer to the Secretary bf State for the Colonies. Thenecessary legislation will be introduced as soon as possible. The corporation have not felt able to indicate when, if ever, the new scheme can be expectedto operate on a commercial basis. Their operations will, therefore, be financedin future from voted monies. If it is found that the project, or some part ofit, is able to pay its way at the end of a development period, it may be possibleto revive some of the capital at a future date. It will not be possible todetermine the scale of further investment until a decision is taken next year on the rate of clearing in the Southern Province.21. Although the scale of the undertaking has now to be reduced for thesecond time and although the establishment of a scheme on an economic basisis not yet in sight, none the less His Majesty&apos;s Government remain convinced of the importance of the project. As revised and redirected it can make a significant contribution to the economic development of East Africa and theresults of the experiments being undertaken in clearing and mechanisedfarming techniques may be of still wider significance and value in many tropicalterritories.
