Hit DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER&apos;! : OF HIS. BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMEiS E C R E 1CP. (5 ,p 324 COPY N&apos;o3229TH DECEMBER   195.JCABINETFUTURE OF THE EAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUT scheme memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer was asKed  by my colleagues (C. M.(50) 83rd conclusions-Minute 4) to discuss with the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theMinister of Food the financial implications of the proposals in their memorandum (CF. (50) 289) and to consult as necessary the Governor of tanganyika and the Chairman of the Overseas Food Corporation.2. In addition to complete abandonment we have ^consideredthree alternative courses:   in each of these farming would continue as planned on the land already felled in ,c\.ongwa and Urambo.   They woulddiffer solely in the extent of development in the Southern Province whichmight be (1)   105,000 acres, (2) 60,000 acres, (3) as at present,i. e* 2 3,000 acres,   A summary of the financial implications of the threealternatives is given in the Appendix.    The figures are necessarilyhazardous;   I make some comment on them below.   It is even more difficultto assess the cost of complete abandonment, involving as it would compen-sation for broken contracts and maintenance of personnel in East Africauntil arrangements could be made to bring them home.   But it is thoughtthat the cost might be about   &apos;-iz millions plus  3 millions for loss ofmoney spent on railway and port development in the Southern Province whicr:might be offset by,  3 millions from disposal of stores and equipment, say a net  4  millions.3. The financial implications on assumptions as to yield and price, which are possibly optimistic, therefore look something like this:-Compensation etc.Railway, Port and oil InstallationsFurther expen&amp;i-tureLess receipts fromsurplus storesNet further expenditure-Possible out-turn ona standard year after 7 yearsSurplusDeficit1(105,000acres)(a)7.507.50.756. 75.0762 ,   3(60,000 (20,000acres) acres)(  million)(a)5. 505. 501. 12iu 38.077(a)5.503.504.(aban donrcent)4.503. 007.50.

(a) With, adequate notice this need not be large and will be set against additional receipts from surplus stores on winding up.(b) There would be a continuing liability of between  130,000 and 200,000 per annum to be compounded if the scheme were abandoned later on.4- -      Alternative 1, the 105,000 acre scheme, involves felling a further40,000 acres this wet season and 15,000 acres in each of the threeSucceeding wet seasons.    The Chairman of the Overseas Food Corporationtold us that the Board proposed this scheme for the following reasons, ofwhich the first counted by far the most heavily with them:-(i)   Substantial compensation will have to be paid unless the programmeof felling 40,000 acres this wet season is carried out.   To clear andcultivate this 40,000 acres a force of 30 operational tractors will be needed.    These 30 tractors could be used in future wet seasonsto fell 15,000 acres.(ii)   Further felling would improve the morale of the employees.(iii)   If the experiment succeeds there would be a larger area under cultivation.These reasons do not seem to me adequate justification for spending afurther  7f millions without any certainty of a profitable out-turn.Moreover, if it were decided to proceed with Alternative 2 (60,000 acres) and ifthis proved successful we could in three years1 time enlarge the felledarea to 105,000 acres.    But there is no reason why we should commit ourselves to this now.    i am therefore opposed to the 105,000 acres scheme..5. Alternative 3, the 20,000 acre scheme, is on the face of it theleast expensive for the next seven years but even on optimistic assumptionsthere is no prospect of its paying its way and if it were continued.it would haveto be subsidised indefinitely..   It might be thought that a cheaper course thanabandonment would be to continue the 20,000 acre scheme, giving notice and making other arrangements in such a way that it could be wound up in ayear or so without the substantial compensation payments which abandonmentrequires.    Not only, however, does this alteration make no provision inthe annual expenditure for payments under the railway and port and oilinstallation guarantees but also it takes no account of the capital lossunder the guarantees, which would be larger than the  3 millions referredto in paragraph 2 if the port and railway were run for a year or two and thenabandoned.    In the light of this, Alternative 3 is clearly more costly thaneither 2 or 4,   Nobody recommends this alternative and since it is not expected on any assumption to be profit-earning, it clearly merits no furtherconsideration,6. The real alternatives seem to be, therefore, either 60,000 acresor abandonment.    In outlay there is little between them, certainly not enoughto be significant in the light of the inevitably hazardous nature of the figures.I should, however, draw attention to the assumptions on which the figures are based and their implication.7. On the price and yield assumptions made by the iVfinistry of food the undertaking would always operate at a ioss;   and even these assumptionsmake no allowance for catastrophes, such as the complete loss of crops fromdrought.   The Overseas Food Corporation believe, however, that the yieldsshould increase to a substantially higher level.    They   ustify this by the

expectation of:-r(a) improving technique of cultivation(b) natural improvement in the nature of the soil from cultivation,There is no precisely comparable cultivation elsewhere against which to assessthis judgment.   But it is not held by the best agricultural advice to be&apos;impossibleof achievement.   Nevertheless, eventual profits are speculative even without making provision for amortisation of capital   or service of interest.   Theassumption on price which is agreed between the -Ministry of Food and the overseas Food Corporation, is  48 a ton at railhead.   This is five or six times the pre-war price, and more than the Ministry of Food paid this year.But it is well below the price to be paid next year and, given the world shortageof oils and fats, it is in the view of the xvlinister of Food the best assumptionthat can be made in the forseeable future.8. The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Governor of tanganyika have represented the political effects in Tanganyika and EastAfrica generally (apart from the effect at home) of abandonment nowwithout any effective trial of agriculture.    These would be loss of prestige toHis majesty&apos;s Government;   disturbance of confidence, particularly amongAfricans, in our policy of colonial development;   discrediting of the policyof state investment in colonial agriculture which might prejudice the work ofthe Colonial Development Corporation in East Africa;   and economic co-operation Administration investments might be disturbed through lackof confidence.   Abandonment would also cause serious embarrassment when theUnited Nations -Mission visits Tanganyika (a trust territory) next year andwith the Trusteeship Council generally;   the scheme has been criticisedinternationally as a piece of colonial exploitation in the interests of theUnited Kingdom and this criticism would be held to be justified if it were abandoned now that it has been shown to be of no immediate benefit from thepoint of view of United Kingdom food supplies,9. Taking account of these factors, and of the political effect here of complete abandonment, and setting them against the fact that there is little difference in cost between abandonment and the 60,000 acre scheme, I conclude that we should proceed with the latter *   In recommending this course to mycolleagues, however, I must emphasise:-(i)   the estimates must be hazardous, and I am doubtful of the outcome.(ii) we must therefore be prepared to close down farming if at the end of seven years there is no prospect of its paying; or even earlier ifthe forecasts prove altogether too optimistic.(iii)   we should consider in good time whether progress justifies furtherfelling beyond the 60,000 acres so that, if the decision is against it,adequate notice may be given to employees and compensation andother &quot;abandonment&quot; expenditure avoided.(iv)   the political effect of abandonment of either further felling or farminglauer on would be far less, both here and in Tanganyika, thanabandonment now, when cultivation on any scale is only just beginningahd-the concept has not yet been proved.

1Q. There remains the question of the. seven year &quot;guarantee&quot; of farming which the Overseas Food Corporation consider necessary if moraleis to be maintained.   This must not be anything in the nature of a contract,and should be limited to an expression of intention so that the way is opento abandonment of farming (apart altogether from further felling) if it isproving altogether too costly,11.. I therefore recommend:-(a) that we proceed with the 60,.000 acre scheme ;(b) the question of further felling beyond a total of 60,000 acresshould be reviewed early in 1954 in the light of such experienceas has by then been gained;(c) the Government should express their intention of farming land to befelled and cleared for at least a further seven years subject to the initial losses not greatly exceeding the estimates which have beenmade.The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Vfinister of Food concur.H.
