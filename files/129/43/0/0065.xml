(50) 31514th December, 1950CABINETECONOMIC report note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate herewith a note on the more important statistics relating to theeconomic situation which have become available since the last Economic Report(CP. (50) 245).H. G.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,14th December, 1950.ECONOMIC report . Man-power the working population increased by 50,000 in September and 46,000 inOctober.   In September, the increase was partly due to the number of boys and girls entering the labour market for the first time at the end of the holiday season,and in October to the seasonal increase in the number of women entering the:distributive and food manufacturing trades.2. The strength of the Armed Forces, which reached its lowest post-war levelin May this year, is now gradually increasing. During September and October itrose by 22,000 to 723,000, the highest total since December 1949.3. The number in civil employment rose during the two months by 57,000.Manufacturing gained 100,000, of whom 52,000 went into the metals, engineering and vehicle trades. There was a decline of 7,000 in coal mining, 14,000 in transport and communication, and a seasonal fall of 32,000 in those engaged in professional,financial and miscellaneous services due largely to the reduced activity in cateringand hotels.4. The number of persons unemployed in Great Britain at 13th november was 302,000, compared with 304,000 in the previous month and 324,000 a yearago. A decrease in unemployment is unusual at this time of the year and must betaken to reflect abnormally heavy demands for man-power by industry and theincreased recruitment by the Armed Forces.5. Unemployment in Development Areas has shown little change in recent months and continues to account for two-fifths of total unemployment. In theindividual areas, the only pronounced movement has been in the South Wales andMonmouth Area, where unemployment in October and November has been 14 percent, and 18 per cent, respectively lower than a year ago.39745 - &apos; b
. H. Production6. Since the beginning of 1950 the volume of industrial production has been maintained at between,-; 8 and 9 per cent, above the levels achieved a year ago.The increase in manufacturing industries has been nearly 10,per cent., largely owing to big increases in the output of the vehicles and engineering trades. Pro-visional figures for October show that this rate of increase over last year is being maintained.Interim Index of Industrial ProductionAverage 1946=100Percent.1949                1950 increase1st Quarter             ...      128                 140 92nd Quarter    ......      129                 140 83rd Quarter    ......      123                 134 9October          .....      135 146-147 8-9Orders on Hand7. Substantial orders op Government account have now been placed for aircraft and munitions. There has also been a sharp rise in new orders for merchantvessels; new orders for nearly 300,000 gross tons in October were nearly three times the rate of the previous three months. Since June, orders for iron and steel by home consumers, probably for stock-building, have been almost half a million tonsin excess of the normal rate of ordering. The demand for building and civil engineering work remains high and many licences particularly for miscellaneouswork, continue to be refused. Export demand in general also remains high and therewas a,particularly sharp increase in export orders for cotton piece-goods duringthe third quarter of the year.Coal8. During October and November the output of deep-mined coal averaged4T5 million tons a week compared with 4 19 million tons a week in the sameperiod in 1949. In the week ending 9th December the output rose to 4-39 million tons against 4-38 million tons in the corresponding week of 1949, the increase beingpartly due to the extension of Saturday shift working.9. In the first 49 weeks of the year the output of deep-mined coal was aboutIf million tons above that of 1949, whilst the output of opencast coal was slightly lower than last year. As a result, there has been only an additional T3 million tons to meet an increase of inland consumption of over 6 million tons. exports have had to be reduced and arrangements made to import coal to arrest the declinein stocks.1,0. Over the past twelve months, the number of wage earners on the collierybooks has fallen by 22,000, of whom 9,000 were workers at the coal face. this per cent, decline in man-power has been offset by small increases in output permanshift and small reductions in absenteeism. In November, output per manshiftwas 1 per cent, higher than a year ago (2 per cent, for face workers) and thepercentage rate of absenteeism was less than in November 1949.Steel11. The weekly rate of the output of steel ingots and castings in October was328,000 tons, and the record rate of 336^000 tons in November. Production is nowrunning at nearly 7 per cent, above the level in the corresponding period of 1949.12. Output of pig iron in October and November averaged 194,000 tons atweek compared with 186,000 tons in October and November 1949. Trie total forthe first 48 weeks of the year was 8-9 million tons about 1 per cent, above theoutput in the corresponding weeks of 1949.13. Stocks of pig iron and scrap, which reached their highest levels in august and July respectively,. have been falling in recent weeks. Stocks of scrap have declined from 907,000 at the end of July to 708,000 tons at the end of November;
Textiles - .       ,1 14. The level of textile production in recent weeks has continued to exceedthat of the corresponding period last year. Output of cotton yarn in the eight weeks ended 25th November shows an increase of 6 per cent, over last year, andrayon and nylon yarns in October showed a rise of 31 per cent, over October 1949,Production of worsted yarn in October was 16 per cent, greater than:a year ago.;.15. Output of cotton and rayon fabrics in October was 10 per cent, higherthan a year ago. Production of woven wool fabrics in the third quarter of the yearshowed no change from the third quarter of 1949.Motor Vehicles16. The output of passenger cars in October achieved a record weekly averageof 11,348 vehicles. Three-quarters of these were produced fpr export andone-quarter for the home market. During the first ten months of this year the proportions of light, medium and heavy cars produced have been much the sameas in 1949.17. The weekly output of commercial motor vehicles and chassis in Octoberwas 5,438, slightly below the record weekly output in May. 62 per cent, were forexport and 38 per cent, for the home market.Merchant Shipbuilding18. The tonnage of merchant shipping under construction in British shipyardsat the end of October remained at .1-8 million gross tons. The tonnage of vesselsundergoing repair and conversion in British ports showed a further slight declineduring the month.Housing19. The number of permanent houses completed in Great Britain rose from17,398 in September to 17,603 in October. The total for the first ten months of1950 was 164,768, an increase of 990 over the same period last year.20. The number of permanent houses under construction at the end of Sep-tember was 204,214 5,836 more than at the end of September 1949.Ill-Stocks21. The index of the volume of stocks of food and feeding-stuffs, rawmaterials, tobacco and petroleum products (December 1949^ 100) has fallen from102 in September 1949 to a provisional figure of 89 in September 1950 (Table 12).22. The index of stocks of raw materials has fallen from 108 in September1949 to 90 in September 1950. The decline was particularly marked in non-ferrous metals, textile materials, wood pulp, newsprint and timber.IV. Internal Financial Situation23. The decline in unemployment in November, instead of the usual seasonalincrease and the increase in employment in manufacturing industry, indicates a small but distinct increase in the pressure of demand upon resources compared with recent months. The high level of orders on hand, both home and export, does not promiseany reversal of this trend. The other indications of the strength of demand given below are available only up to October. The increase in prices up to October can be accounted for by the increase in import costs and probably does not imply a rise of labour costs or of profit margins at home. Autumn buying by consumers inOctober no longer looks abnormal, and retail stocks appear to have increased more rapidly than in recent months.Import Prices24. Import prices rose rapidly between September and October. The index of import prices (1947 = 100) was 143 in October, an increase of 8 per cent, since june and 30 per cent, since September 1949. Most of the rise since June has been inthe price of imports of raw materials.Wholesale Prices25.   Wholesale prices also continued to rise in October. The Board of Tradeindex (1938 ^ 100) was 252 in June, 268 in September, 275 in October and 284 in39745 &apos; &apos;     b 2
November. Almost all the rise since June has been due to the increase in prices ofindustrial materials and manufactures, particularly non-ferrous metals, cotton and wool.Retail Prices26. The Interim Index of Retail Prices (June 1947 - 100) stood at 115 in mid-October compared with 114 in September. Between the middle of October and december it is expected there will be a further increase in the index to 116 owing,to a rise in prices of sausages, potatoes and fresh fruit, and to a further increase inthe prices of clothing and household goods.Export Prices27. Export prices, after remaining unchanged for some months, again advanced in October. The index (1947 = 100) was 119 in June, 121 from July to September,and. 123 in October. Export prices have been rising much less quickly than import prices, implying a deterioration in the terms of trade of about 4 per cent, since june and about 20 per cent, since September 1949.Retail Sales and Stocks28. Retail sales increased sharply in September but less markedly in October,when trade was only moderately above the level of a year ago. Total sales of large-scale shops in September were 16 per cent, higher than a year ago; in October theywere 8 per cent, higher. There was also a large increase compared with a year ago inmany items of the trade of independent retailers in September, but the increase was less general in October. For both large and small shops, much of the increase insales since August was concentrated on furnishings and on apparel, where autumnbuying started much earlier than last year.29. Stocks of large-scale retailers at the end of September were little in excessof last year&apos;s figures, but in October they increased more rapidly. Non-food stocks in September and October were 5 and 12 per cent, higher by value respectivelythan in the same months of 1949. The rise in retail stocks of apparel was accom-panied by a large fall in wholesale stocks, which, however, remain well above lastyears level.Wage Rates30. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100)advanced one point in October, to 111. This was the first change since January 1950.31. In October 278,900 workpeople received increases in weekly full-timewages amounting to  78,000. 175,600 had their weekly wages reduced by  4,400.These decreases occurred under cost of living sliding scale agreements because ofthe fall in August of one point in the Index of Retail Prices which affected wages in the iron and steel group of trades and one or two other industries. The rise ofone point in the Retail Price Index for the months of September and October will lead to wage increases in these trades in later months.32. Announcements were made during October of new claims for wage increases for dock workers, merchant seamen, omnibus workers, and workers in building and furniture-making.33. Important claims are still under consideration, including those of workersin shipbuilding, railways, and clothing trades and some workers in the employmentof the health services, local authorities and national government.Money and Credit34. New capital issues on private account were  15 million in November.Over the past twelve months they have amounted to  302 million. This compares with  250 million and  129 million in the twelve months up to November 1948 and1949 respectively.35. Lending by the banks has increased little over the month, although therehas been a-significant increase since a year ago. Advances to customers by theLondon clearing banks (roughly representing bank accommodation to the private sector) stood at  1,610 million on 15th November. This was an increase of 12 million over the previous month and of  137 million over November 1949. The
total of money at call, bills discounted. Treasury deposit receipts and investment(which roughly represents direct and indirect bank accommodation to the Govern-ment) was  3,985 million in November, compared with  3,971 million in october and  3,968 million in November 1949.36. Bank deposits, as a result of the lending operations of the banks, arelittle changed from last month, but significantly higher than a year ago. The netdeposits of the London clearing banks were  6,251 million in November, an increaseof  47 million over October, and of  185 million over November 1949-37. Security prices have tended to rise since the beginning of the year, and therise has been more marked over the last four months. The Actuaries&apos; Index of ordinary share prices (1938 = 100) averaged 128-6 in January, 133-5 in July, and142-8 in September. In October it was 142-4. The rise in gilt-edged prices hasalso been more marked over the last four months and was continued in October.The price of 2-J- per cent. Consols averaged 69-7 in January, 69-2 in July, 71 - 8 inSeptember and 73-4 in October. The fall in the rate of interest over the last four months therefore has been significant, the yield on Consols having fallen from anaverage of 3-61 in July to 3-40 in October, More recently, however, the effect ofthe new crisis in Korea at the end Of November has been to depress stock exchangevalues.Y. External Financial SituationExternal Trade38. Both imports and exports rose again in November. Exports andre-exports rose to record levels and the adverse balance of visible trade was only 12-3 niillion, a slight increase over the October figure of  11-4 million but wellbelow the: average of  29-3 million for the first ten months of the year.39. The value of exports reached a provisional figure of  211 -9 million. Thiswas  9-7 million above the record October figure and  35-0 million above theaverage for the first ten months of the year. Imports, which had declined monthlyduring the third quarter, rose sharply in October to  223 million and again inNovember to a provisional figure of  234-5 million.40. Exports to North America in November reached the record level of 28-3 million, of which  13-8 million went to the United States and  14-5 million to Canada. In the first nine months of the year imports from North Americaaveraged about  31 -2 million a month.Exports to United States and Canada(monthly averages)$U.S. million				Total,		Un	ited		North	Exchange	States		Canada	America	Rate1949, 1st Quarter	21	2	26-7	47-9	$4-03^ j2nd Quarter	13	4	26-5	39-9	553rd Quarter	15	1	25-2	40-3	554th Quarter	18	7	200	38-7	$2-80^11950, 1st Quarter	18	8	23-9	42-8	5?2nd Quarter	20	4	28-6	48-9	5 53rd Quarter	30-	5	30-6	61-0	55October ...	36	8	33-7	70-5	55November      ..	38	5	40-6	79 1	55Balance of Payments41. As mentioned in the previous Report, a marked decline took place in theinflow of funds from North America during the course of October, and throughoutNovember the movement has been on a more normal scale. In consequence the sterling area gold and dollar surplus, which rose exceptionally to $305 million inOctober, fell to approximately $40 million in November.   Even this latter figure
includes certain large, non-recurrent receipts, e.g., a substantial sale of dollars(reversible, later on) by Brazil against sterling, of which she is temporarily short.&apos; 42. Despite this slackening in the pressure of demand for sterling from north america, our sterling liabilities to United States and Canadian residents have fallen by only about  34; rmllion in November, (after rising by  47 million in October).More recently there have been signs that may indicate an acceleration in the rate at which sterling holdings are being drawn on: It is reasonable-to expect, therefore,that by the end of December some part of the abnormal inward movement ofmoney in Septenibcf-Octbber will have been worked off.43. United Kingdom. &quot;sterling liabilities to all countries rose by  95 million in October. Of this, United States and Canada accounted for  47 million (as already stated); the bulk of the remainder was in holdings by sterling area countries,mainly Australia and Malaj^a. Both of these are enjoying exceptionally high prices for their principal exports (wool, rubber and tin), and the rise is likely to continue.44. Against this sharp increase in our short-term liabilities in October theremust be set:  (a) the increase in our gold and dollar reserves, which amounted to $356 millionv ( 127 million);(b) the increase in our holdings of non-dollar (predominantly O.E.E.C.)currencies, which amounted to  30 million. In October, too, we paidoff  28 million of our &quot;initial debit&quot; with the European payments union, in connection with the settlement of our surplus with the union for July-September. (The remainder  25 million has since beenrepaid in November, and we are now  50 million in credit with theUnion.)In sum these developments are consistent with a substantial surplus in theUnited Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments on current account at the present time.European Payments Union45. The Swiss Parliament ratified Switzerland&apos;s adherence to the european payments Union on 27th October, 1950.46. The third E.P.U. operation, in respect of November 1950, has been carriedout. The provisional estimate of the United Kingdom net surplus with the Union,including Switzerland, for November is  35-1 million, making a total of 149-4 million for the period July to November. The amount of United Kingdomsurplus to be written off against conditional dollar aid is  53 - 6 million, which, after allowing for the use of  11-1 million of sterling balances by other countries to meetdeficits with the Union, results in a receipt by the United Kingdom of  4-5 million in gold or dollars and a credit with E.P.U. of  80-2 million.47.: The United Kingdom and France are now the main creditor countries of western Europe and both have now earned some gold from the E.P.U. The mostsubstantial debtor is Western Germany whose quota is now practically exhausted.A proposal to grant special assistance to Germany until she can take the measures necessary to correct her balance of payments deficit is currently being debated inParis.
