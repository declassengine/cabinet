DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&quot;SECRETCP.(50) 2533RD NOVEMBER, 1950IMPORTANCE OF COAL EXPORTS IN THE foreign relations OF THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe failure of the United Kingdom to retain its positionas a major coal exporting country would have serious consequences for thedevelopment of our foreign policy.   Traditionally the United Kingdom islooked upon as a great coal producing and exporting country.   We exportedninety million tons in 1913 and fifty million tons in 193 7.   Since the war our ability to restore our exports of coal has been, rightly or wrongly, thetouchstone of our economic recovery and national resilience.2. This circumstance has been much emphasised in our association with the European Recovery Programme and our membership of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.   One of theUnited Kingdom^ major contributions to European recovery has lainin the provision of coal although we have fallen well below the export figureswe included in the original Committee of European Economic Co-operationsubmission to Mr. Marshall.   With rearmament, the demand for UnitedKingdom coal is likely to be greater than ever.   A drastic reduction in our exports for 1951 and succeeding years might well affect the medium-termproduction programme of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.   insofar as coal is not available in Europe, recourse may again have to be made to theUnited States for coal supplies, which will increase the dependence of otherNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation Powers on American productive capacity and on American finance.3. These considerations affect the general reputation and prestige of the United Kingdom and the belief of foreign countries, friendly andhostile, in the economic power and stability of the country.   But a sharpdiminution in our coal exports will have specific effects of a serious characterboth in the short and in the long term.4. It can be argued that while the United Kingdom may now beexporting less coal, it is using more coal to manufacture other things forexport.   While this is true, it is not consoling for importing countries who can, at a pinch, do without the other goods but cannot do without the coal.United Kingdom coal is a most valuable bargaining counter in trade negotiations.   Notably in Scandinavia our coal brings in return iron ore,timber, pulp and foodstuffs.   There is a definite risk that in the short termwe may have greater difficulty in getting adequate supplies of these commoditie5. In the longer term, a reduction of our coal exports may havepolitical consequences, all the more serious since the countries which are dependent on British coal are in some cases those with which we have the copy NO.   3&amp;CABINET

closest political ties.   This is again particularly true of the scandinavian countries with whom in recent years we have sought close relationships both political and economic, e.g. Uniscan.   We do not want the scandinavian countries to turn to, and become increasingly dependent on, Poland and, per-haps again, Germany for fuel supplies.    This might in time affect the ability of Norway and Denmark to play their part in r;earmament and inAtlantic defence.6. Somewhat similar considerations apply in the case of Italy.A sharp reduction of our coal exports to that country would have the conse-quence of driving her also to Polish and German sources of supply and, tothe extent to which these might notbe available, would cause industrialunemployment with its inevitable urge towards political extremism incontemporary Italian conditions.7. Argentina and Spain are two countries where for the momentpolitical considerations may be less important but where economic factors may be vital.   In the case of Spain we secure iron ore in return for coal of low quality.   In the case of Argentina coal has always been a majorelement in our mutual trade.8. In the past I have had a feeling that our coal exports werelooked upon as marginal in the sense that the export market should have whatwas left after all domestic requirements had been satisfied.   I am convinced that it is of great importance to endeavour to have somestability in our coal exports and some specific allocation between domestic demand and exports.   Obviously we cannot risk another fuel crisis in theUnited Kingdom since this would have effects on our prestige andforeign relations far worse than those which will follow upon a reductionin our exports.   But it is essential that our exports should be stable andcertain.9, The conclusion is that from the point of view of our external relations it is of the utmost importance to maintain coal production at a level sufficient to cover not only domestic needs but also anadequate volume of exports.E.
