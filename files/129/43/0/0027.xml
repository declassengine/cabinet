MS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 27721ST NOVEMBER, 1950COPY NO._CABINETTHE NEPALESE CRISISMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs cc-yt^irIntroduction     *    * &quot;        &quot; ----^^-^^The King of Nepal, having taken refuge in the Indian Embassy atKathmandu on 6th November, was flown out to New Delhi on 11th November.A minor son of the Crown Prince was unanimously proclaimed King in hisstead by the Nepalese Parliament.     We have received formal intimationof the accession from the Nepalese Government and have been asked to accord recognition to the new King.2. The Government of India have declined to recognise the newKing.     They are putting pressure on the present Government of Nepalto accelerate internal reforms and are working for the reinstatement ofthe old King.3. We agree that further reforms are needed in Nepal.     We areprepared, when the issue of the succession is settled, to press for these to be accelerated.     We regard the succession, however, as an internalmatter for Nepal, and do not consider that the recognition issue shouldbe linked with the reforms.recommendations.We recommend to our colleagues that:(a) His Majesty&apos;s Government should recognise the new King ofNepal on the grounds that the present regime is firmly established andin effective control of the country, and should communicate their recog-nition to the Nepalese Government as soon as possible;(b) in the meantime, our decision and the reasons for it should be immediately communicated to the Government of India, the other Common-wealth Governments and the Governments of the United States, France andthe Netherlands;(c) a personal message should be sent to Mr. Nehru, in answer to a message from him to the Prime Minister on this subject, urging that theGovernment of India should reconsider their decision not to recognise thenew King of Nepal and pointing out:-(i)     that in our view, whatever faults the existing regime in Nepalmay have, it offers at present the only prospect of stability;

(ii)     that pressure for the reinstatement of the old King will cause the downfall of the regime and lead to chaos in Nepal;(iii)     that we sympathise with the Indian desire for a liberalisation of the present administration and are prepared to urge thison the Nepalese Government, but are clear that this shouldnot be in any way connected with recognition of the new King.Argument5. The present regime is firmly established and in effective controlof the country, having successfully put down the disorders fomented by theNepali National Congress - an organisation based largely in India whichaims at overthrowing the present Nepalese Government.     The change ofmonarch is an internal affair for Nepal,     The question whether it was achieved by constitutional means is in the circumstances irrelevant,and His Majesty&apos;s Government are entitled to recognise the change ofmonarch.6, There is ground for suspecting that the Indian aim is to oustthe present Government of Nepal and to establish a puppet regime, withthe old King at the head of a predominantly Nepali National CongressGovernment,     In pursuit of this aim, she is likely to exert all forms of pressure on the Nepalese Government short of invasion.     If she succeedsin her aim, a period of internal disorder will ensue in Nepal, for the mass of the people are loyal to the present Government;  and our supply ofGurkhas will cease - the Nepali National Congress has already threatenedthis.7. We believe that the true goad of the Nepalese lies in reformsbrought about through the present Government,     We are ready to urgethis on the Maharaja;   and our word will carry great weight, providedthat we have recognised the new King - though we shall have to hastenslowly in order to avoid the impression of exploiting the present crisis.8, Our decision to recognise the new King will be unwelcome to theGovernment of India.     It may be that, faced with our decision and the effective restoration of order in Nepal, the Government of India willreconsider their attitude.     We must in any case be prepared to run therisk that disagreement with India will cause her to be less co-operativein other matters, e. g. over Chinese intervention in Korea.     Further to delay our decision may cause even more serious disagreement with indian the end, and the only alternative which we can adopt is to agree withthe Government of India&apos;s line.     By doing this, we should make it clearnot only to the Nepalese but to the world at large that we were choosingthe path of expediency;   we should mortally offend the Nepalese Govern-ment, thus endangering our source of Gurkhas;   and we should beassisting India in undermining the present Nepalese regime and plungingthe country into chaos.E.B.-sign-i Qffin, &apos;G.W-.lT21ST NOVEMBER, 1950.
