this -DOCUMENT- IS THE PROPERT-Y OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET    -CP.(50) 3025TH DECEMBER, 1950COPY NO.J  cabinet coal EMERGENCY measures memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerMy colleagues will no doubt wish to be kept in touch with the developments in the coal situation and we should, I think, take stock each week of the progress that is being made in dealing with the many problems that are arising.THE WINTER problem. The winter problem is, as I have already stated, one of findinganother 3 million tons of coal needed if our stocks this winter are not to fall below the minimum safety level of 9 million tons.     The three mainsources are:-(i)     imports of coal, from which, in view of shipping difficulties,however, we cannot yet count on much more than 1 million tons in the crucial months January to March (and perhaps not even that much, unless arrangements can be made tobring in Polish coal);(ii)     reduction of exports, which should yield f million tons inthe period January to March (1 million to the end of April);(iii)     an improvement in output.Measures to secure (i) and (ii) are now under way, and there is at presentnothing further to say, except that I hope that everything possible will bedone to secure the maximum number of ships that can be used for american coal, together with early supplies of Polish coal.3. It remains to be seen whether output will increase sufficiently to cover the remainder of the 3 million ton gap (1 to 1^ million tons).If we could exceed last year&apos;s output by 50,000 tons a week for the restof the winter we should, as I have already told the miners, be out of thewoed.     Indeed, if we get full value from our decisions on imports and exports (i. e. if million tons), I think it wotuld be safe to say that we mightavoid serious difficulties, if, on average, for the rest of the winter, output was as good as last year&apos;s.4. What are our chances of doing thi.5 ?    When I last reported,deep-mined output had averaged for the pre vious four weeks 82,000 tonsa week below last year&apos;s output.     Last week , I am glad to say there was some improvement in deep-mined output, which came close to last year&apos;sfigure;   it increased by 140,000 tons over the previous week, largely owingfi

to an increase of 113,000 tons in Saturday working following the appeal bythe National Coal Board and the National&apos;Union of Mineworkers.Saturday working gave us last week 37,000 tons more than it did in thecorresponding week last year.     Unhappily, however, owing to bad weather, the opencast output was low and total output (deep-mined andopencast) was still nearly 60,000 torts below last year&apos;s figure.5. It must in present circumstances remain a very open questionwhether we shall achieve last year&apos;s level of output over the rest of thewinter.     If we do, we ought to be reasonably safe from critical shortages;but whether we do must depend very largely on three factors:-(i)     whether we can keep the results of Saturday working appreciablyabove last year&apos;s level, without losing ground from moreabsenteeism during the week;(ii)     whether fog or snow interrupts the movement of wagons, andso stops pits from winding;(iii)     our luck with the weather in connection with opencast.On (i), I am seeing the mining Members of Parliament tomorrow and asking them to co-operate with us in their constituencies in the drive for more coal.     Between now and Christmas we may expect good results, andthe testing time will be after Christmas when, through illness and other causes, a relaxation of effort is all too likely.     On (iii), there is nothingwe can do, except to see that all available opencast machinery is workedwherever and whenever possible:   and here I would ask my colleagues toco-operate in accelerating the clearance of opencast sites in the manner suggested in C.P,(50) 296.THE PROBLEM FOR 19516. Our problem for 1951 largely centres on man-power.     As Ihave already said (in C*P*(50) 297) a recent Ministry of Labour enquiryhas found that in 1951 there may be a further loss to coalmining of22,000 workers (that is) by the end of 195l a decline in the total labour force to 663,000).    Previous Ministry of Labour forecasts of this kindhave been exceedingly    accurate, and I am in consequence all the moredisturbed by this estimate, which, as I have already said, would, on current estimates of productivity, mean a decline in exports (and ships&apos;bunkers) from this years figure of 1 7 million tons to 7 million tons.7. Pending further consideration, I have arranged for the national coal Board and the Overseas Negotiations Committee to be warned that,for the time being, cargo export commitments are not to be entered into that would depend on an export and bunker programme for 1951 higherthan 7 million tons.     It may be that we can take steps to secure a bigenough addition to the mining labour force to enable us to give a higher figure for exports at some later date (or it may be that we shall continuethe import of coal in order to maintain exports - a matter that theOfficial Coal Committee have under consideration);   but until we can seeour way more clearly we must not repeat the mistake we made last summer of entering into commitments that we cannot fulfil.     I recommend thatwhen we are informing the Economic Commission for Europe of ourposition on imports and the decision to cut exports, we should at the sametime warn them that our 1951 exports will probably not exceed 7 million tons, but that, of course, if the position improves, we shall take immediate steps to increase our export availability.

8. The problem before us is whether we can find means ofreversing the decline in man-power and securing a steady increase during the whole of next year, ending the year, I suggest, with an increaseof 20,000 men, and a total labour force 40,000 higher than the 663,000forecast by the Ministry of Labour.     I would have liked to set the targethigher (since this figure will give us only 12 million tons for exports andbunkers, compared with the 1950 figure of 1 7 million tons);  but 40,000is a very large number and drastic action will be needed to secure eventhat figure;9. I have asked the National Coal Board to get ahead, in conjunctionwith the Ministry of Labour, with arrangements for a big recruitingcampaign (following the Cabinet Conclusions of 4th December),, and while the campaign may do some good, it is bound to be seriously, if notfatally, handicapped by the consideration that underground coalmining,in comparison with all the other work that is increasingly available, isnot an attractive job.10. We cannot, in my view, hope to restore the position, unless anduntil we find ways and means of making coalmining appreciably more attractive than other work.     I see no alternative but to attach a numberof special privileges to mining, and I would ask my colleagues now to approve the two that I have suggested in C.P,(50) 297:-(i)     a Supplementary Pensions Scheme for miners;(ii)      an option for service in the mines in place of service inthe Forces.11; I would be grateful if my colleagues would also let me have their advice on other forms of concession that could be granted, for I do notthink these two by themselves will suffice.12. Personally I think it may be found desirable to give minersfurther housing privileges, but I do not ask for this to be considereduntil I have a firm proposal to make to the Cabinet about what should bedone to provide mobile labour to build houses for miners in speciallydifficult areas.     I understand the OfficialCoal Committee is making some progress on this matter.13. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree to my recommendations on: -(a) opencast coal (paragraph 5 above);(b) the intimation to be given to the Economic Commission for europe (patragraph 7);(c) supplementary pensions (paragraph 10 (i));(d) opting for the mines (paragraph 10(ii)).P.J.N.-B.inistry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1,5TH DECEMBER, 1950.
