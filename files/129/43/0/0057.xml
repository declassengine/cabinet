(50) 60th Conclusions, Minute 3) theCabinet invited the Minister of State (in my absence in New York) to arrangefor the practical aspects of the international status of the Korean conflict to befurther examined with the Departments concerned. An inter-departmentalcommittee was thereupon established and has now submitted its report which hasbeen circulated to interested Departments. The Cabinet further decided that, after this inter-departmental examination had taken place, the Minister pf State should consult with the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for ..commonwealth relations and the Attorney-General, with a view to arranging for the legal and practical issues involved to be discussed with other Commonwealth governments and the United States Government. These consultations have also taken place,but my three colleagues and I considered that, prior to discussions with otherGovernments, the matter should again be referred to the Cabinet.2. The report does not concentrate on the particular circumstances of Koreabut examines, from the general standpoint, the respective advantages to HisMajesty&apos;s Government of treating such a conflict as a &quot; war &quot; in the traditionalsense, or as a collective police operation under the United Nations. It assumes forthe purposes of the enquiry that either alternative is legally possible under inter-national law. The general conclusion of the report is that, although there arelikely to be some difficulties in domestic law and some disadvantages in internationallaw, the balance of advantage, after taking into account the strong political argu-ments, lies in treating such a conflict as an international police operation rather than as a war. In addition to the political advantages, there are alsc certain aspects ofinternational law, such as the denial of neutral rights, which lend support to this conclusion.3. My three colleagues and I are in general agreement with the report, andin particular with the view that there are strong political arguments for avoidingsaying that we are technically at war with North Korea. These arguments havebeen greatly reinforced by the Chinese intervention. For if we were to say that wewere at war with North Korea, we might find it difficult to avoid having to admit that we were at &quot; war &quot; with China. It would be hard to maintain that we were at war with North Korea but not with China, whose forces were engaged against oursin far greater numbers.4. Whatever the present military situation in Korea, the decision to regardour participation as collective police action under the United Nations rather than as &quot; war &quot; may set a precedent for the future whose implications could usefully bediscussed with other Commonwealth and the United States Governments. In orderto implement the previous Cabinet decision on this subject, I propose, therefore,that these Governments should be given a summary of the portions of the report which are not purely domestic and be informed that if, after studying it, they wishto discuss the subject with us, we will be very ready to do so.39768
5. The report does not examine in detail the implications in domestic law of adecision to regard a conflict such as that in Korea as a police operation rather than as a war. It recognises, however, that difficulties will arise if, as is likely, certain provisions of the common law or statute law are not regarded as equally applicableto collective police operations as to war. Since the Committee reported, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Attorney-General have drawn special attention to this aspect of the problem and to the preparations which will have-tobe made in advance, including the drafting of legislation. The report also mentionsvarious other implications of this subject which are not directly concerned! with legislation but which require urgent consideration in connection withall^emergencyplanning. Although the work of examining these domestic implications and draft-ing the necessary legislation will fall ultimately to the Departments concerned, i suggest that the appropriate official committee of the Cabinet should be givengeneral responsibility for seeing that the reports recommendations in this field are carried out.recommendations i ask my colleagues to-(i) take note of the general conclusion of the report and the proposals for discussing this subject with other Commonwealth arid the United states government;(ii) request the appropriate official committee of the Cabinet to make itselfgenerally responsible for ensuring that the report&apos;s recommendations: regarding the domestic implications of the subject are implemented.E.
