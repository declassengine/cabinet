DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL.CP.(50) 279 COPY NO.  3221ST NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETGOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYEES:ANNUAL LEAVEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer wish to consult my colleagues on a claim made by the TradeUnion Side of the Joint Co-ordinating Committee, on behalf of all Govern-ment industrial employees, that their leave should be increased from oneto two weeks.Present position2. Government industrial employees now get one week&apos;s annualleave with payx in every calendar year as well as nine &quot;paid holidays&quot;(e. g. Bank Holidays, Christmas, etc. ).     Claims have been made for manyyears by the Trade Union Side that the leave should be increased to two weeks in addition to the paid holidays.     To concede the claim would costsome  2,250,000 a year.Arguments in favour of conceding the claim3. The Government are committed in principle.     In 1946 and 1947my two predecessors after considering the practice in outside industriesexpressed sympathy with the claim, but regarded the time as inappropriate for granting it.    After further approaches by the Trade Union Side, theOfficial Side in January, 1950, replied, with Sir Stafford Cripps&apos; authority,that although existing economic circumstances compelled a refusal of theclaim, &quot;as soon as there was a let-up it should be high on the list of things to be done&quot;.     It may be argued that the Government have recognised thattimes are now easier, both in allowing the recommendations of the ChorleyReport to be carried into effect, when they had been suspended earlier, andin the general relaxation of the very strict limitations imposed immediatelyafter devaluation,4. About three-fifths of the industrial employees in outside industriesnow get two weeks&apos; paid holiday.Arguments against conceding the claim5. There are still important industries in which two weeks&apos; leave isnot given.     Only one week&apos;s leave is given in coalmining, agriculture,building, engineering, shipbuilding, textiles and a number of other manu-facturing industries.x A few groups of employees in particular trades get more than one week,but their number is inconsiderable.

6. In almost all industries not more than six paid holidays inaddition to annual leave are given, whereas since 1946 the number forGovernment employees has increased by stages from five to nine.Moreover, since 1946 the Government have introduced schemes fornon-contributory pensions and for paid sick leave.     Even, therefore,if in the majority of outside industries the annual leave entitlement is greater, that advantage is off-set by these other benefits in Governmentemployment.7. A concession by the Government would undoubtedly stimulate the demand for two weeks&apos; leave in that part of industry which still onlygives one week and would encourage a revival of the proposal by theTrade Unions for legislation to make the grant of two weeks1 holiday with pay compulsory in all industries.     The concession of the extra week bothin the Government service and in those sections of industry which follow the Government lead would be expensive and the extra cost would fall on production.     No evidence has been produced to show that the increase in production costs would be off-set by any increase in production whetherdue to improved health or any other cause.     The ministry of Labour have said that they know of no analysis which attributes the recent increases of production in certain industries to longer holidays.recommendation. I recommend that the claim should be rejected on the groundthat in spite of the improvement since last year our economic positionstill does not warrant the granting of such a concession, which would add to the public expense without giving any increase in production, and whichwould lead to a demand for a similar concession in industries important to the export drive and the defence programme.H.G.reasury Chambers, S.W.1,21ST NOVEMBER, 1950.
