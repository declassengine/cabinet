A*CP.(50) 27114TH NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETCOAL EMERGENCY measures memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power attach for the Cabinefs consideration a report on the coal situation by the Official Coal Committee under Sir Edwin Plowden&apos;chairmanship.    I am very grateful to him and to the Official coal committee for a prompt, clear and close analysis of our coal prospectsduring the coming winter, and of the immediate measures that might betaken to improve them.2. I am in substantial agreement both with the analysis and withthe remedies that are proposed.    There has been a serious deterioration-tion in the past few weeks.     Until October, coal output had been abovelast year&apos;s level but recently it has fallen badly below that level -Output in 1950 *compared with 1949Tons 000&apos;sOctober3rd week............... -   64th     &quot;     ............... - 41November1st week................ - 582nd    &quot;    . . .............. - 813. We cannot possibly ignore the significance of this decline and ofits rapid acceleration.    Even supposing there is no further increase inthe rate of decline, it will mean that we shall have a deficit of nearly Z\million tons on our winter coal operations, which in turn must mean thatour stocks in the winter may drop below the minimum safety level of 9million tons to 7 million tons (with house coal stocks at nil, and merchantsshort on their deliveries to householders by \ million tons).     I need onlypoint out that it was the fall of stock to 8. 3 million tons in December, 1946,and the further fall to 6. 7 million tons in January, 1947, that landed us inthe fuel crisis which did so much damage to our economy.    I should add that the greatest hardship would inevitably fall on the poorer sections ofthe community, who have to rely on small weekly deliveries of coal;   forany priority system for the poorer consumers must inevitably break downwhen a coal merchant has no coal to deliver.x  With losses through disputes omitted for both years.

13 i.4. We have had one fuel crisis;   we cannot have another;   and I see no alternative but to put into immediate operation all practicable measures that can be taken to restore the situation; notwithstanding that they may cause us difficulty and embarrassment.5. I agree with the Official Coal Committee that we should accept in principle the reduction to the^maximum practicable extent of coalsupplied for ships1 bunkers and overseas bunker depots.6. 1 further agree that we should instruct the National Coal board to take urgent action to import coal from the United States up to 1 million tons and more if possible.     When they have tested the marketthe National Coal Board should report within a week on the maximumquantities of coal that they are likely to be able to bring in from january to March next year*7. If j as may be the case, it appears from the National coal board&apos;s report that we shall be unable to secure more than, say I4million tons from bunkers and imports, we shall have to consider how we are to bridge a remaining gap of      million tons.     In that event, weshall be forced to consider a further reduction of exports, and in themeantime officials should, I suggest, be examining the distribution of an export cut of (a) \ million tons and (b) 1 million tons, and assessing theeffect of each proposal on our trade and relations with the countries concerned.8. I also agree that we should consider the steps to be taken toreduce inessential commercial use of lighting and I am examiningfurther the proposal to re-institute the control over coke.9. I understand from Sir Edwin Plowden that there are on footinterdepartmental enquiries   into the following matters.among others:-(a) The possibility of young men being given an option for the minesas an alternative to military service.(b) Refusal on the part of recruiting officers to accept ex-minersfor the Forces.(c) Return of reservists to the mines.(d) The re-introduction of the ring fence, and the recruitment of irish and foreign labour.(e) Supplementary pensions for miners to check wastage.(f) Emergency action to secure more houses for miners.(g) Reconsideration of the opencast coal programme.(h) Reduction of consumption, including the possibility of some reduction in the supplies of industrial coal.(i) Relaxation of restrictions on the use of fuel oil.(j)     Measures to stimulate the use of improved domestic solidfuel appliances.

Most of these proposals would not only contribute to the solution of the longer term coal problems over the next five years - and these aregrave - but would also, in varying degrees, help us with our more immediate problems.     I hope that in the course of a few days these enquiries will have reached a stage at which preliminary decisions ofpolicy can be taken.10. In the meantime I am myself taking up with the National coal board and the National Union of Mineworkers (N,U.M.) how the vitalneed for more coal can best be brought home to the miners, and whether any further steps can be taken to revive the autumn production drivewhich up to now is failing so lamentably.11. I think that it would be both necessary and desirable that Ishould give the House of Commons a comprehensive statement of thecoal situation next week (it would be undesirable to do so earlier because i think we ought to give the National Coal Board a week in which they canconduct in secrecy their preliminary negotiations for imports).     In that statement it would be desirable not only that I should give due warning ofthe gravity of the situation, but also that I should be able at the same timeto make a full statement on the new measures that the Government aretaking to counter the dangers that are now threatening us.     That is whyurgent decisions are needed on the various measures listed above.Immediately prior to the statement it would also be desirable that Ishould see the N.U.M. privately and explain the position to them.12. If my colleagues agree, I would propose to prepare a draft ofthe statement after consultation with the Chief Economic InformationOfficer and submit it to them on Monday next.P.J.N.-B.Ij    Ministry of Fuel and Power,S.W.1,14TH NOVEMBER, 1950.

First Report by the Chairman of the Official coal committee to the Minister of Fuel and power the Official Coal Committee under my chairmanship set up bythe Cabinet on 6th November has reviewed the prospective coal situationover the winter.     The situation is serious.     We have therefore thoughtit essential before completing all our enquiries to make recommenda-tions at once on measures on which immediate decisions are necessary.The general position.2. The large increases in industrial production over the past year,which have been a major factor in our economic recovery, have involved an increased consumption of coal.     We also increased our coal exports,in view of their vital importance to our commercial and political policy generally and to European economic co-operation.     Our level of coal exports in the first half of the year was one-third higher than in 1949.Coal production, although it .V*as over the first ten months increased by1. 1 per cent over 1949, has not kept pace.     In July it became necessaryto start to cut our exports.     Despite this, at the end of October - thebeginning of the fuel winter - coal stocks, at 15.4 million tons, were1. 3 million tons less than a year ago.3. In the last six weeks, the trends of production - as set out inTable A in Annex I - have been most disquieting.     Weekly output has notmerely failed to show an adequate increase, but has dropped below thatof last year.     In the first two weeks of November, when output normallyis rising sharply until Christmas, 200,000 tons less coal were producedthan last year.     If the shortfall on last year continues at this rate we see no possible way of avoiding a major fuel crisis.     We do not atpresent consider that we must assume that there will be no improvement on the last two weeks, and the revised estimate in this paper of deep-mined output of 104 million tons is worked out in the light of generaltrends in recent months.     Even on this basis the situation is dangerous.The consequential changes in the winter budget are shown in Table B in annex I.    All calculations are made on the assumption of normal winterweather.     It will be seen that on the revised basis the end-winter stockwould be only 6,730,000 tons.     In fact stocks would not fall as low as this because deliveries to consumers could not be fully maintained.     we expect the shortages of large coal to be such that the domestic consumerwill have to go short of 500,000 tons of house coal.4. In last year&apos;s mild weather we ended the winter with stocks of9. 2 million tons.     It is the considered view of the National Coal Boardand Ministry of Fuel and Power, who are the responsible authorities, thatwe ought to try to avoid running down stocks during the winter below 9million tons.     The reasons for this view are given in paragraphs 1 to 7 of annex II.    As is there explained, it is impossible to indicate with anyprecision at what lower point severe difficulties will ensue, and at whatpoint these would develop into a general crisis with power stations out ofaction.     In 1946-47, when the level of activity in the country was lower than at present, the main fuel crisis came in February and stocks were reduced at the end of March to 5,477,000 tons.     Difficulties in industry,with closing of factories and unemployment, were however experiencedeven before the New Year, when stocks stood at 8,279,000 tons.x  Note.    Terms of reference and composition of the OfficialCoal Committee are at Annex IV.-1-

5. The first impact of shortages will not affect all uses and allregions equally.     The prospects are discussed in paragraphs 7 and 8 of annex II.     It seems likely that they will-be felt acutely by the domesticconsumer early in 1951, inevitably hitting hardest the consumers with nostorage space.     Power stations and industry are likely to get intoserious difficulties, including temporary stoppages of industry through lack of coal.     Regionally the impact is likely to be most marked in theWest Midlands and Lancashire, industrial areas with important export and armament industries.Possible Remedies.6. We are pursuing as quickly as possible our examination ofvarious measures, in connection with man-power, opencast coal policy,etc. which may help the long term position, and which may in somecases have some effect on this winter&apos;s output.     But clearly their effecton this winter&apos;s output cannot be large, and we have therefore concentratedour attention on immediate steps to improve matters in the short term.These include:-(i)     Restrictions on consumption.    We are examining and will report further on the possibilities of restrictions on consumption.   Most of these,like rationing industrial consumers, would inevitably cause dislocationand unemployment due to the slowing down of factories.   They would,however, be necessary as a crisis measure.    There are certain immediatepossibilities, however, such as the curtailment of shop lighting and otherinessential commercial uses of electricity.   These might provide some200,000 tons over the winter.(ii)     Coke control for domestic consumers should be restored to ensurefair shares.(iii)     Bunkering.   The maximum possible cuts might amount to425,000 tons over the whole winter.   Some of these would cause considerabledislocation to shipping, and some of the coal used for bunkering wouldnot be suitable for the home market.   The possible saving, includingsavings on exports of coal to overseas bunker depots, may not be morethan 300,000 tons.(iv)     Exports.   Exports have already been cut severely.   If we stopsending abroad any coal which could be used on the internal market,up to 1,000,000 tons further could be provided, though with an addedstrain on internal and coastwise transport.   Annex III brings out the gravepolitical and economic objections to making further cuts on exports at this juncture.   Other reports to Ministers have shown the difficulties causedby our present cuts.   We believe that no further cuts should be made atpresent, but that the possible saving should be looked on as a last reserveif the situation continues to deteriorate.(v)     Imports.    The Coal Board consider that, if they could beginplacing orders and arranging for ships immediately, they could beginimports from the United States in the first week in January, and bring inbetween 500,000 and 750,000 tons (and possibly - with shipping help fromthe United States Government - up to about 1,000,000 tons) of &quot;run of the mineUnited States coal, in about four months.    The limiting factors areavailability - there are growing European enquiries for United Statescoal;   shipping, which is becoming tight;   and port and rail handling in thiscountry.   The cost, if orders were placed before prices increased substantially, would be of the order of  6. 10. per ton, of which $14 wouldbe in dollars.

7. The measures at paragraph 6(i) and 6(iii) are not likely to find  -more than 500,000 tons extra coal.   Even if exports were cut again, whichwe do not for the moment recommend, it would not be possible by thesemeans to bridge the gap.   We consequently recommend that the coal board should be instructed to import from the U.S.A.    We would stress the necessity of an immediate decision if imports are to arrive in time tohelp.8. We have not ignored the political implications of a decision to import coal.   But recent production trends are causing a growingrealisation that coal difficulties are ahead.   The implications of theannouncement and putting into effect of the bunkering restrictions willbe clear to industry, while the enforcement of restrictions on shoplighting would be widely noticed by the general public.   Any effectivesteps therefore will make it clear to the community that there is aserious danger of a coal crisis.   We consider moreover that a government statement, putting the position in proper perspective and outlining themeasures to be taken, is an essential step in obtaining the necessaryco-operation from the community in effecting economies.summary. The most serious feature of the situation is the worsening trend of production.   Our analysis convinces us that, assuming a normalwinter, and assuming that the trends of production improve somewhat,there will be serious coal shortages this winter unless emergency measures are taken.      The intensity of the shortages cannot beestimated with precision, but there will be(i)   Shortfalls of deliveries to industry, and power cuts, whichwill cause dislocation, reduction of industrial output and come degree of unemployment;(ii)   Shortages of house coal which will hit the poorest consumer.If the winter is hard, these shortages will be greater, causing widespreaddislocation which might be comparable to the crisis of 1947.10. We therefore consider it essential that immediate measures should be taken to reduce the extent of dislocation and if possible averta complete breakdown in coal supplies.   We accordingly recommend, asthe first and most urgent steps -(l)     that a decision in principle be taken to reduce provision forbunkers to the maximum extent compatible with avoiding dislocation ofshipping, the details of the decision to be worked out further with theMinistry of Transport and the Ministry of Fuel and Power;(2)     that a decision in principle be taken to reduce inessentialcommercial use of lighting, details similarly to be worked out by theMinistry of Fuel and Power.(3)     that the Coal Board be instructed to take immediate and energeticsteps to import coal from the U,S. A, , the amounts to be up to 1,000,000 tonsin the first instance, but to be increased if more can be obtained and shippedsubject to consultation between the Ministry of Fuel and Power and theTreasury,(4)    that a Government announcement on the situation be made as soonas possible.(Signed)   E.

CURRENT PRODUCTION TRENDS AND the revised WINTER BUDG-ET1.     The current trends of production are set out in thefollowing Table, Table A,  which shows output of deepminedcoal since May 1950, compared with the same months in 1949.It will be seen that in the last six weeks less coal has been produced than in the corresponding period of 1949.      Theworsening of the position as compared with earlier forecastsis due not so much to the decline in man-power but to theslov/ing down of the improvement in output per man shift to2.2 per cent against 3.7 per cent last year.TABLBMillion tons	Output in 1950	Output in 1949	Difference, (h-)  or (-) between output in 1950 as compared with 1949May (4 weeks)	16.35	15.83	4- 0.52June (-5 weeks)	19.19	19.07	+ 0.12July-August (8 weeks)	27.29	26.92	-f 0.37September (5 weeks)	19.93	19. 83	+ 0.10October (4 weeks)	16.43	16.47	- 0.04October,  1st week	4.07	4.07	0.00October, 2nd week	4.09	4.08	4- 0.01October,  3rd week	4.15	4.16	- 0.01October,  4th week	4.12.	4.16   .	- 0.04November, 1st w ek	4.14	4.26	- 0.12November,  2nd week	4.17	4.25	- 0.082.

The estimate of deepmiried output in line 1 is some 1,200,000 tonslleSTthan for the last coal winter.    This is based on general trends in non--power and output per man shift shown in recent months.    It will beseen from Table A that in the first two weeks of November production was200,000 tons less than in the corresponding week of last year.    It ishoped that the shortfall on last year will not continue at this rate.If it did the estimate of deepmined output would have to be furtnerreduced.

ANNEX IIs^fe stock levels and the impact of shortages1,      The winter budget, summarised at Table B in Annex i,which is constructed on the same principles as those forprevious winters, contains detailed provisions for the levelsbelow which stocks by the principal groups of consumersshould not be allowed to fall by the end of April.    Gas works,power stations, engineering and other industry are put at weeks&apos;  consumption; railways and iron and steel at 2 weeks&apos; ;coke ovens at 1.7 weeks&apos;.    This, with miscellaneous itemsproduces an end-April stock target of 9 million tons.    Thedifference between this year&apos;s and last year&apos;s targets is discussed below with the consequent increases in the end-Apriltarget...2.      As compared with the winter of 191+9/50, the target forengineering a.nd other industry has been raised from 2 to 3weeks    (500,000 tons increase;.. Last winter there wasconstant criticism by industry of the inadequacy of the target of 2 weeks:;    fortunately, unexpectedly high outputat the beginning of the winter supplemented by withdrawalsfrom undistributed stocks made it possible to increasesupplies to industry and consequently to prevent its stocksfrom falling to the level planned;    the actual end-April stocksamounted, for engineering, to 3.8 weeks   and for generalindustry to 3.L weeks.    This year, it was decided that a3 week end-winter.stock was the minimum that should beprovided.    This view has since been strongly reinforced byrepresentations received from the Federation of BritishIndustries, to which (at the N.P.A.C.I.) an undertaking hasbeen given that end-April stocks shall not be allowed to fall below that level. &apos;;3*      G-as works1  stocks last winter Were a source of constantanxiety and special steps had to be ta.ken to support theprogramme.    The actual end-April stock was 2*b, weeks&apos;consumption.    In view of the cardinal importance of this programme to industry and the domestic consumer, it wasdecided to put this winter&apos;s end-April stock at 3 weeks(300,000 tons increase).      This was rendered a,ll the more necessary because it was clear that house coal would be substantially under-delivered and that power stations wouldalso certainly be in difficulties.h.      The target for the railways was increased from 1.5 to2 weeks (120,000 tons increase).5.      Increases in consumption by gas works, power stations,engineering and other industry has made it necessary in eachcase to revalue the tonnage equivalent of one week&apos;sconsumption,  (310,000 tons increase in all).6.      These increases amounting to 1,230,000 tons would have brought end-April 1951 stocks to 9.b-8 million tons, but adecision to va.lue end-winter house coal stocks at 0.25million tons (instead of 0.5 million tons) and to adoptlower levels for coke ovens and miscellaneous (230,000 tons)reduced the  total target to 9 million tons, the figure shownin the budget.    These calculations are shown in Table C below.-3

7.     With the expected deficit on the winter, budget stocks at the end of March, as shown in line 12 of Table B, would amount to 7*30 million tons if all programmes were equallyunder-delivered.    The Ministry of Fuel and Power point outthat, in fact, however,, the shortage of large coal will involve a contraction in sales of house coal by merchants to consumers a.nd not a, reduction of stocks as these areprogrammed to virtually nil at the end of april.    By the endof March it is likely therefore (l) that total stocks will amount to about 7.8 million tons and (2) that by the end ofApril supplies to householders will already have beencurtailed by about 500,000 tons, an under-supply whichwill mea.n that many coal depots will have been emptied andgreat hardship caused.8.     Thus, in the judgement of the Ministry of Fuel and Powerand of the National Coal Board, it is -probable that, if nothing is done to increase supplies (a) there will be aserious house coal crisis early in 1951 and (b) that power stations and industry will be in serious difficulties,including in the case of industry, temporary stoppages ofwork through lack of coal.    If the average temperature iscolder than the normal (assumed in the budget), the industrialstoppages will be much more widespread.9.      As regards the regional impact of shortages, it islikely that they will be felt first in the &quot;west Midlands andLancashire, vital areas where we can ill afford restriction of industrial production, even if only for a few weeks.    Thesituation in the West Midlands is most serious.    This areaincludes Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton and Stoke, andcontains a large share of the general engineering, motor car,aircraft a.nd metal manufacturing industries which have been responsible for much of the increased output and exports in19^9 and 1950 and on which we are relying for increased production, including defence production, in 1951.    Localcoal production is short a.nd shortages of house coal arelikely to be felt before Christmas, since adequate quantitiesof large coal must be provided to the railways.    Individualindustrial consumers, particularly in engineering, in thearea are also likely to be acutely anxious about their stock position before the New Yea.r and more generally after theNew Year.    Difficulties in South Lancashire may not arise so soon, but stocks are low, and the possibilities of supplementingthem limited by rail capacity through the Pennines.    Gasworks and power stations may be affected, as may textiles,radio and electrical engineerings munitions and chemicals.-h-

ANNEX IIIEXPORTS IN THE GOAL WINTER 1950/511.     The provision for cargo exports in the present winterhas already been severely cut and now stands at the very low level of J+.1 million tons or half the actual amount of exports in the winter 191+9/50.    Including shipments to bunkerdepots abroad this gives s. rate of 15b,000 tons, a week.2.      We have&apos; reviewed in detail with the Ministry of Fuel and power and the National Coal Board the export programme onwhich the Overseas Negotiations Committee is now working forthe Calendar Year 1951? which includes the last four monthsof the coal winter, and have calculated the maximum amount which in an extreme emergency it would be possible to divert,to inland consumers.3*      There are four reasons why it would not be possible  toplace on the inland market the whole of the tonnage involved.:(l) About 25,000 tons a week (from South Wales and Scotland)consists of anthracite which could not be substituted forother grades of coal;    (2) Some 10,000 tons a week (from scotland, Durham, South Wales) consists of low volatile duffswhich are quite unsaleable to inland consumers;    (3) Between23.000 and 30,000 tons consists of Welsh steam coal, of varying,often low, volatiles, which must also be regarded as unsaleableto inland consumers; (b) In the Northern and Durham Divisions,when maximum account has been taken of all possibilities of distributing to inland consumers, by rail and coastwise shipping, there is about 20,000 tons a. week, which, in the considered opinion of the National Coal Board, could, not be sodistributed;    as regards this tonnage, the only alternative to exporting would be to put pits on short time, in order tobring down total output by this amount.    There is thus between78,000 and 85,000 tons a. week which for one or other of theforegoing reasons could not be diverted from exports to meetinternal needs.1+.      Assuming therefore that it were decided that exports to eire must be maintained at the present cut level (15.000 tonsof coa,ls saleable for consumption in this country) , it should still be physically possible to divert to the inland marketabout 5^*000 to 61,000 tons a week from exports.    this conclusion is, however, subject to the qualification that theincreased and longer rail hauls which would be involved might lead to a. shortage of mineral wagons, since the recentestimate tha.t the supply of wagons this winter will besufficient to meet requirements is based upon the assumptionthat there will be a marked improvement over last winter inthe average turn-round time.    Further, the estimate of possiblediversions from exports to inland consumption assumes,  in thecase of the unsuitable coa.ls from South Wales a.nd Durham(which, owing to the long hauls involved will also be more costly than consumers&apos;  normal supplies) that the most vigorouspressure will be exerted to overcome consumer resistance.    Ifa.ll exports of coal that could be used by inland consumerswere to be cut off a.s quickly a.s possible, it would not,  inthe opinion of the&apos; National Coal Board, be possible to give full effect to the cuts before January.

5,     The effect of a cut in exports of the magnitude discussedabove would be extremely severe for the countries concerned and would no doubt&apos;lead to serious recriminations, while anappeal to O.E.E.C. by European countries concerned would beprobable.    Table D belpw shows what-would be the effect ofsuch a cut in exports on six countries which, by reason ofbeing large - suppliers of essential raw materials and food orotherwise, are of special importance in our foreign trade.Even if we gave these countries adequate time to make other arrangements, they might well need to divert exports away from us to pay for them.    The Swedes have, for instance,apparently instituted an embargo on iron ore to western germany in retaliation for a. German reduction in exportavailabilities.    The psychological effects of export cuts would also be serious at this moment when we are trying to persuade the Americans that they should pay regard to theneeds of the United Kingdom and the countries of western europe and not consult only their own immediate interests in deciding how much of their own raw materials, such as cotton,they should retain for internal use, or how much of the limited quantities available of other raw materials theyshould acquire for stock building,table bEffect on coal exports to certain countries of a further reduction of cargo exports by 55,000 tons a weekWeekly cut       Percentage reduction represented by in exports       cut in exports specified in Col.(lj&apos;-(thousand on total planned     on grades, othertons&quot;J&quot; exports (all than those unsale-grades) able in the UnitedKingdom for inlandconsumption	(1)	(2)	(3)Denmark	lh.0	Ik	79Prance	3.1	25	82Italy	9.2	60	80Spain	7.U	97	100Sweden	9.5	66	66Argentine	7.0	k8	100
