THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE   PROPERTY   OF MIS   BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1950SECRET Copy No.32CP. (50) 31618th December, 1950CABINETSALARIES AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF TOWNCLERKSMemorandum by Minister of Labour and National service in 1948 the Joint Negotiating Committee for Town Clerks and District CouncilClerks was set up to consider salaries and conditions of employment of town clerks and district council clerks. The Committee contains representatives of thefollowing:  Association of Municipal Corporations.Urban District Councils Association.Rural District Councils Association.Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee.Society of Town Clerks.Society of Clerks of Urban District Councils.The Society of Clerks of Rural District Councils.2. The functions of the Committee are to consider from time to time the salary scales and general conditions of service of town clerks and district councilclerks and to make recommendations to the local authorities by which these officers are employed.3. In September 1949 the Committee made certain recommendations regarding salaries and conditions of employment, but, in view of the postponementby the Government of the application of the recommendations of the ChorleyCommittee on the remuneration of the higher Civil Service, they proposed delay inimplementation of part of the recommendations.   They proposed, therefore (a) that the recommendations relating to conditions of service should be putinto effect from 1st October, 1949;(b) that those relating to salaries should in general be deferred, but(c) that local authorities should consider immediately the cases of those clerkswho were within five years of pensionable age and might make salaryadjustments with effect not earlier than 1st April, 1949.4. In September 1950 the Committee further proposed that, in view of theGovernments decision to proceed with the implementation of the Chorley Report,the recommendations mentioned in paragraph 3 (b) should be put into effect from 1st October, 1950.5. The present disputes, however, have nothing to do with this latest develop-ment, but are concerned only with the carrying out of the recommendations inparagraphs 3 (a) and (c). The Society of Town Clerks have informed the Ministrythat the majority of local authorities have already put those recommendations intoeffect, and they have reported disputes with twenty-five local authorities under theConditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order. The claim made ineach case is that the authority concerned should apply the recommendations (a) and where appropriate (c) made by the Joint Negotiating Committee for Town clerks and District Council Clerks.39802
6. As my colleagues will be aware, there has been a good deal of politicalopposition, particularly within the Labour Party, to the implementation of therecommendations of this Committee. There is also strong opposition amongst anumber of local authorities who object to the recommendations on merits and atthe same time challenge the competence of the Committee in this matter. It mustbe recognised that the Committee does not possess the status or the authority of aWhitley Council and, in view of the importance of the question and the doubt whether a dispute concerning a single employee of a local authority can be a disputewithin the meaning of the Conditions of Employment and National ArbitrationOrder, I put the question to the Attorney-General for his opinion on this aspect.7. The Attorney-General has advised that these cases are disputes withinthe meaning of the Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order.Normally, on receiving this advice (and considering that no conciliation actionseems likely to settle the dispute), I would in accordance with past administrationof the Order immediately have referred the cases to the National arbitration tribunal. The Attorney-General has advised, however, that, whilst these disputesare almost certainly trade disputes for the purposes of the Order, I probably havea discretion whether or not to refer these cases to the National arbitration tribunal; and that it is a matter of policy for me to decide what action to take.8. In my memorandum on the Kemsley newspapers case (CP. (50) 313), I mentioned some of the difficulties in the way of my acting on these lines. I willnot recapitulate these points here but I do not think it is open to me in this case to take advantage of the Attorney-general&apos;s opinion. My conciliation, officers invarious Regions have had discussions with representatives of various local authpri-ties about the implementation of the recommendations of the Joint negotiating committee and I would not wish to hold that in having these discussions they werenot taking steps towards a settlement of the dispute. Moreover, it would involvea declaration on my part that I was not prepared to allow this dispute to bedecided by the National Arbitration Tribunal whose impartiality and fairnessshould be beyond question.9. If I refer the cases which have been reported by the Society of TownClerks to the National Arbitration Tribunal for settlement under the Conditionsof. Employment and National Arbitration Order any award in favour of the townclerks will be binding; oh the local authorities concerned. There can, however, belittle doubt that if we continue to postpone reference of the cases to the national arbitration Tribunal the Society will apply to the High Court, for a mandamus.It would, I think, be unfortunate if a second application of this kind should followso soon after the Kemsley newspapers case, to which I have referred above. More-over, as I have already explained, it would be difficult to find any ground on whichthe application Could be opposed. In the circumstances, I feel that I have no option but to refer the cases to the National Arbitration Tribunal but, before: doing so, I Would like to have any views that my colleagues may wish to put forward.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,18th December, 1950.
