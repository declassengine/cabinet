IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. P.(50) 2586.TH NOVEMBER, 1950CHRISTMAS BONUSESMemorandum, by the Minister of food at this time of the year it is customary for me to announce whatbonuses of rationed foods can be given for Christmas.   I have reviewed theposition and propose to announce the following Christmas additions to the rations: -COPY NO, *J IICABINETSugar 1&quot;! lbs.Sweets 6 ozsiCooking fats 4 ozsiTea 4 ozsiBacon 2 ozs.for people over 70 years oldprovided supplies arrive as expected from Canada.2. As far as Christmas fare other than rationed foods isconcerned, the quantity of fruit (apples, tangerines and oranges) shouldsatisfy demand, and mince-meat, crystallised fruit, dried fruit, nuts andChristmas puddings, will be at least as plentiful as last year.   In view ofthe general sugar supply position, I do not propose to repeat the specialissue of sugar which was made available last year to manufacturers of table jellies, candied peel, cakes and biscuits, but nevertheless I expect the supplies of these commodities available for Christmas to be at least asgood as last year.3. I cannot pretend that the Christmas bonuses I propose are a sample as I would have liked.    They are, however, as much as I can safely recommend.   And there will, of course, be a greater variety of otherfoods generally available this Christmas than in previous years.4. I think my colleagues may find the following observations on different commodities useful.   Sugar is perhaps the commodity of greatest importance at present to the housewife.   Last Christmas there was serious criticism of the absence of a sugar bonus, and this was not appeased by theannouncement immediately afterwards that a 1 lb. bonus would be availablein January;-   This year I can make j lb. bonus of sugar from savingssecured by special reductions in the allocations of certain manufacturers,and in addition I propose to bring forward the 1 lb. bonus which would normally be given in January for marmalade.   Of the total bonus of Ij lbs. of sugar, \ lb. will be in the form of Demerara to maintain a proper balance in our stocks.5. The stocks held by the trade are sufficient to enable me to recommea bonus of 6 ess. of sweets.6. I hope to be able to give a bonus of 2 ozs. bacon or possibly to beable to put the bacon ration up from 3 ozs. to 4 ozs. but this will dependon the arrivals of Canadian shipments.   Shipments from Canada have not beenvery satisfactory recently, and I may not be able to say what concession, ifany, can be given until about the 17th November.

7- I would have liked to have given a meat bonus, but unfortunately the cessation of supplies from the Argentine rules this out.8- I am equally disappointed at not being able to recommend a bonusof tea for everybody.   I have considered whether I could give a general teabonus of only 2 ozs.   Apart from the stock position, there is a seriousdrawback to a 2 ozs. distribution, namely that tea is distributed instandard f lb. packets, which means that to serve a single consumer, or anyfamily group consisting of an odd number of persons, the retailer has tosplit the packet.   The weighing and packaging difficulties involved would bea heavy burden on the retail trade, particularly around Christmas time.9. In any case, it would be unwise, in view of the stock position,to give such a bonus, let alone a bonus of 4 ozs.   After arrival and dischargefrom the ships, tea is put in warehouses where it is sorted, weighed,sampled and documented, before being allocated to primary wholesalers.This process normally takes 5 or 6 weeks, but recently it has been speededup to 3 weeks.   Wholesalers then need some 4 weeks at least to blend,package and distribute tea to retailers.   Ministry of Food tea stocks fell tosuch a low level in September (because of small arrivals) that we had to withhold normal allocations totalling \lj million lbs. from primarywholesalers.   This caused considerable inconvenience to the trade and weundertook to replace the amount withheld as soon as possible.   Althougharrivals are now more satisfactory, we cannot further shorten the interval between arrival and the time it is in the retailers&apos; shops.    Furthermore,owing to the different types of trade carried on by various tea wholesalers,stocks in the hands of wholesalers are unevenly distributed and someprimary wholesalers (such as the Manager of the Co-operative wholesale society) are finding it difficult to carry on without their normal workingstock, and are pressing for replacement of the allocation withheld.   after a very careful examination of the position, I am satisfied that to giveextra tea to everybody this Christmas might well prejudice the existingtea ration at the beginning of next year.10. An extra ^ lb. of tea for all people over 70 years old will,however, be very acceptable;   these old people already qualify for specialrations because of the importance of tea to them, but even so I feel theycan well do with this little extra.11. The supply of poultry for Christmas gives rise to a problem ofwhich my colleagues should be aware.   Unfavourable weather has reduced the number of home-grown turkeys and there is an embargo this year on imports from Hungary.   Mainly for these reasons, it is estimated that thetotal supply at Christmas will be about 11,000 tons, as against 13,600 tonslast year.   Other types of poultry are likely to be, if anything, rather more plentiful than last year;  but prices for the supplies which have so far reachedthe market are running very high and although there is some hope that theywill fall when larger quantities come forward this is causing me some anxiety.12. Removal of price control from poultry and restoration of private trade took effect on 1st July last and I have naturally considered whether inpresent circumstances price control should be imposed again.   But if Iwere now to set a maximum price well below the current level of themarket it is likely that the supplies already in this country would disappearfrom normal channels of retail trade and there would also be cancellation of overseas orders not yet delivered and diversion to other markets.

Plainly it would serve no purpose to impose price control at or aboutthe current price level, and indeed this might well have the effect of main-taining prices above the level to which I hope that they will be driven down bycompetition at a later stage.13. The only source from which substantial additional supplies ofturkeys might be obtained is Canada.   According to trade reports, Canadamight be able to send up to 1,000 tons of turkeys and for some lots areasonable price has been quoted to English dealers.   If it were in factpossible to buy about 1,000 tons at fairly low prices this might well tendto bring down the high prices now ruling;  but it is not likely that theCanadian price would remain low if the trade were allowed to buy aconsiderable quantity, and still less if the Ministry were to attempt to buy the whole quantity direct.   In any event, it is doubtful whether enoughCanadian turkeys could be brought here in time to take effect on the market and to allow me to re-impose price control at a reasonable level before thegeneral public begins to buy.   I have therefore reached the conclusionthat in the face of this uncertainty about the effectiveness of such apurchase in bringing down prices I should not be justified in incurringexpenditure of about 1^ million dollars.14. I shall, of course, make the usual Order prohibiting theservice of turkey in restaurants more than once during Christmas week.Apart from this, I think it will be best to rely upon the force of competitionwhen larger supplies come into the market (supplies from Irelandare being held back at present and should have a marked effect) and onconsumer resistance to high prices.   Last year there was a markedresistance even at much lower prices and the market broke a day or two before Christma,s.   This year, the probable deficiency in supplies is not,I am satisfied, large enough to support the high prices now ruling and I hopethat the break may come a good deal earlier.   I propose a little later on tomake it clear to the public that this is my hope and that the prices nowruling are unreasonably high.15. I would like my colleagues approval to the proposals outlined above for the Christmas bonuses.M. W.Ministry of Food, S. W. 1. ,6TH NOVEMBER, 1950.
