THIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROTERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT^&quot; &apos;&quot;*&quot; ^Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1950SECRET Copy No.   32......,1 I,....... ii itCP. (50) 28321th November, 1950CABINETEGYPTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsInternal AffairsAfter five years of government through his personal nominees, King Faroukdecided in 1949 to allow the traditionally anti-palace party, the Wafd, to join inan all-party coalition. In the elections which followed last January the Wafdobtained an overwhelming majority in the Chamber of Deputies, and Egypt has since been governed by an all-Wafdist Government under Nahas Pasha, who had long been regarded as a bitter personal enemy of the King. Since the Wafd took office, however, their relations with the Palace have been surprisingly good, and, withthe aid of a royal decree of doubtful legality enacted this summer, they nowcommand a working majority in the Senate. Thus, at the beginning of this year,for the first time since Egypt was granted independence, the country found itselfabout to be governed by what was generally regarded as a popular administrationcommitted to a programme of social and economic reform and supported by theKing.2. Nevertheless, the internal situation has shown no improvement, for three main reasons. First, the cost of living, already high, has risen steadily during thepast year. Secondly, in spite of its programme of reform, the present Governmenthas so far done little to improve the standard of living of the Egyptian people,most of whom live in abject poverty. Thirdly, the position of the King, and to someextent that of his Government too, has been shaken by the Palestine war armsscandal. The enquiry has not been completed, but it has already led to the resignation of the Commander-in-chief (a protege of the King) and the compulsoryretirement of the Chief of Staff. The scandal is believed also to involve other persons close to King Farouk, notably his favourite and principal political adviser,Kerim Tabet.3. The Opposition parties, however, controlling only a handful of seats in theEgyptian Parliament, are virtually powerless. The Minister of the Interior has beensensible enough to ensure the loyalty of the police to the Government. There is no sign of any military leader capable of turning the army&apos;s present discontent anddisillusionment to political advantage. Though Egypt is potentially a fertilebreeding ground for communism, the Egyptian Communist movement is small,disunited and ineffective, and the Wafd have so far been at pains to remain on goodterms with the Moslem Brotherhood, the only important Egyptian movementpossessing a political machine comparable to their own. (The Moslem Brotherhoodis a politico-religious organisation whose terrorist campaign culminated two yearsago in the assassination of the Egyptian Chief of Police and the Prime Minister,Nokrashy Pasha). There is therefore no likelihood of any early change in theEgyptian political scene, and the present situation in Egypt can best be described as one of unstable equilibrium.The Defence of Egypt4. His Majesty&apos;s Governments right to station troops in Egypt is based onthe Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance of 1936, which has another six years to run.39695 b
The most important military provision (Article 8) of this Treaty is that authorisingHis Majesty&apos;s Government, &quot; until the Egyptian Army is in a position to ensure by its, own resources the liberty and entire security of navigation of the [Suez] Canal,&quot;to station land forces not exceeding 10,000 and air forces not exceeding 400 pilotsin a specified zone near the Canal, in order to ensure its defence in co-operationwith the Egyptian forces. (The Treaty also permits the R.A.F. pilots to be accom-panied bv the &quot; necessary ancillary personnel for administrative and technicalduties.&quot;)5. At the present moment, there are over three times as many troops stationed in Egypt as the Treaty allows. Of these, the Land Striking Force accounts for approximatly 7,000, the R.A.F. and army air defence units 10,000, and G.H.Q.Middle East Land Force and Base troops 13,000. Thus nearly half the entire forceconsists of administrative and technical personnel required to man G.H.Q. andthe Middle East Base established in Egypt during the last war, for which no pro-vision was made in the 1936 Treaty, and there are in addition some 8,000 Mauritiantroops engaged in guarding the Base. Moreover, the largest and most importantinstallation in the Middle East Base, the Tel-el-Kebir Depot, is situated well outsidethe Treaty zone mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The strategic emphasishas in fact shifted since 1936, and our primary strategic requirement is now not somuch the defence of the Suez Canal itself as the maintenance of a Base in Egyptcapable of rapid expansion on the outbreak of war, in order to support a majorcampaign in the Middle East and the defence of the base against air attack.6. During the past 18 months every effort has been made (including my ownvisit to Cairo in January, two recent visits by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, and a series of discussions between His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and theEgyptian Foreign Minister) to explain to the Egyptian Government the urgency ofthe Soviet threat to Middle East security and the strategic reasons why, if theMiddle East is to be successfully defended against a Soviet attack, the Middle EastBase must, in the Chiefs of Staffs opinion, be located in Egypt. In addition, it hasbeen made clear to the Egyptian Government that we should be willing to substitute the 1936 Treaty by a fresh treaty of alliance or defence agreement which, whileguaranteeing our minimum strategic requirements, would provide for (a) A joint Anglo-Egyptian Headquarters;(b) Joint maintenance of the Middle East Base;(c) Joint air defence of Egypt; and(d) Renunciation of His Majesty&apos;s Governments responsibility for the defenceof the Suez Canal (a political point of honour, connected with ourinheritance of Ottoman rights in this respect, to which the Egyptiansattach considerable importance).7. Despite these concessions, the Egyptian Government, who, like mostEgyptians, are far more afraid of Israel than of the Soviet Union, are still onlydimly aware of the danger of the Soviet aggression; they have categorically refused\to accept the principle of joint defence in peacetime; and they have continued topress for an end to be put to what they still regard as British &quot; occupation,&quot; by the unconditional evacuation of all His Majesty&apos;s Forces from Egypt. The latest andmost emphatic re-statement of this demand was contained in the Speech from the throne delivered at the opening of the Egyptian Parliament on 16th November,in which the Egyptian Government, without formally denouncing the 1936 Treaty,virtually declared it null and void. Though King Farouk himself is believed tobe privately convinced of the wisdom of concluding a defence agreement on thelines indicated above, he does not appear to be capable of imposing his will on his ministers in this respect. Virtual deadlock has thus been reached.8. Two possible ways of breaking this deadlock are now under consideration.First, a Joint Anglo-American demarche to Egypt. Second, the discussion of proposals for defence discussions with Egypt in a wider context-e.g., with Turkey,with Turkey and Greece, with these countries and some other commonwealth country or countries, or even with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, as isalready being done in the cases of Greece and Turkey. The first alternative hasbeen recommended in recent politico-military talks in Washington, and the UnitedStates Government have told us that they are prepared to consider any suggestionwe may put forward.   The various alternative possibilities which fall under the
second alternative are further examined in a separate paper (CP. (50) 284)concerning the forthcoming-discussions with the Egyptian Foreign Minister. .\ 9. The Egyptian Government are, however, deeply committed by a series ofpublic,utterances to the principle of &quot;total evacuation.&quot; Since they took office theyhave made no effort to educate public opinion to&apos; appreciate the realities of theircountfy&apos;s situation; and even though they may be prepared to continue to discussdefence for some&apos; time to come, it is doubtful whether they would ever feel able toabandon this; principle, whatever form of agreement was adopted to disguise itsrenunciation. &apos;10. There is often misunderstanding of the attitude which the egyptian government would adopt towards a future war. .11. When the aggression by North Korea took place; the Egyptian Goyern-ment voted in the Security Council to condemn the aggression, but abstained onthe resolution for action to resist it, on the grounds that the United Nations hadtaken an unfair and prejudiced attitude over Israel. Subsequently, however,they voted for the General Assembly Resolution of 3rd November entitled &quot; Unitingfor Peace &quot; which provides for action by the Assembly in the event of the security council failing to deal promptly with a threat or act of aggression, recommendsMember-States to maintain within their armed forces a unit which could be madeavailable for service as a United Nations unit, and establish a collective measurescommittee on which Egypt herself will serve. Further, the Egyptian Governmenthave so far told us that in the event of war they are prepared for British forces to reoccupy the base in Egypt, and that they are prepared to negotiate a new Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance, provided there are no British Forces in Egypt in peace-time.12. If, therefore, we are prepared to leave the Base installations and material in Egypt under Egyptian supervision, perhaps with a certain number of Britishtechnicians, to assist in its care, in return for an undertaking that we could reoccupyit in time of war, and if we were to station our striking force, with a subsidiary peace-time base to supply it, in a neighbouring territory, e.g., Libya, or in several territories,e.g., Libya, the Gaza Strip, and Cyprus, it is possible that we could conclude a new treaty with Egypt at any time. To this, however, there are grave strategic (but notnecessarily political) objections. These are again under review by the Chiefs ofStaff.13. We are, therefore, broadly speaking, faced with the following alternative courses of action:  (a) to continue to maintain our forces in Egypt until 1956, despite such Egyptianopposition as may develop, in the hope that in the course of the next six years, one of two things will happen. Either the Soviet threat to theMiddle East will have become so much clearer to the Egyptian Govern-ment that they will alter their attitude, or the international situation willhave changed so much for the better that the issue will no longer havethe same importance.If we take this line, we can of course continue to discuss alternativesolutions in the hope that some acceptable compromise will emerge.(b) To seek to reach an early agreement on the lines of paragraph 12 above,. possibly combining this with one of the alternative forms of regional. arrangement.   The Egyptian Government would probably agree to arrangements for the stationing of our striking force elsewhere in theMiddle East within a period of a year or perhaps two years.14. Failing some early agreement or understanding with the egyptian government, it is possible that they may seek, by means of administrative obstruc-tion, such as the denial of port., railway and labour facilities, to make our continuedpresence in the Canal Zone impossible. A recent study of this problem by theChiefs of Staff suggests that the situation in which our troops might find themselvesshould the Egyptians resort to such extreme measures, would be difficult andmight involve considerable additional expenditure, but would not, if we wereresolute, be impossible. There are, moreover, certain counter-measures open tous, such as the withholding of the oil normally pumped to Cairo through armypipelines, which no Egyptian Government could contemplate with equanimity.39695      1 :   -&apos;:  1 ; - &quot;-&apos; B 2
15. In an exchange of notes which accompanied the 1936 Treaty, His Majesty&apos;s )Government gave the following undertaking:-     yV-&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom undertake to use their good offices to facilitate the supply (of such) armaments and equipment- from the United Kingdom, at prices similar to those which would be paidby His Majesty&apos;s Government, whenever the Egyptian Government so desire.&quot;16. The Egyptian Government have constantly alleged that His majesty&apos;s government have deliberately kept the Egyptian Forces deprived of Weapons whichthey require for their self-defence, and eventually for the defence of the canal zone, so as to maintain their own grip on Egypt. This has for many years beenamong the major causes of Anglo-Egyptian friction. If His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdefault on this obligation under the Treaty, they give the Egyptian government reason for maintaining that, as His Majesty&apos;s Government are breaking theTreaty, Egypt is justified in doing so also. Moreover, the denial of arms to Egyptby His Majesty&apos;s Government does not prevent Egypt from obtaining arms fromother countries. There is some evidence to show that Czechoslovakia is againoffering to supply Egypt with arms, and it is undesirable that Egypt should turn to Eastern Europe for her means of self-defence.17. The whole question of the further supply of arms to Egypt will have tobe reviewed in the light of the forthcoming talks with the Egyptian ForeignMinister. The requirements of our own and of other Commonwealth Forces, andof N.A.T.O. countries must, of course, come first.The Sudan18. The recent Speech from the Egyptian Throne contemplated the abrogationnot only of the 1936 Treaty of Alliance but also of the Anglo-Egyptian Con-dominium Agreement of 1899, upon which the Sudan&apos;s status in international lawis based. Under the provisions of this agreement, joint responsibility for the conductof the Sudan&apos;s international relations was vested in His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe Egyptian Government, who delegated responsibility for the internal governmentof the Sudan to a Governor-General, to be appointed by the King of Egypt, onthe recommendation of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The agreement confers very wide powers on the Governor-General. Since the last war, however, there havebeen two important developments in the Sudan: first, the rapid introduction ofSudanese into the administration, and, secondly, the ordinance whereby, in 1948,the Governor-General set up an Executive Council, which now has a Sudanesemajority, and a Legislative Assembly, the vast majority of whose members areSudanese. This ordinance was approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government but not by the Egyptian Government, who have continued to maintain their traditionalview (reiterated in the recent Speech from the Throne) that the Sudan, despite the condominium Agreement, has never ceased to be an integral part of the Kingdomof Egypt.19. This view no Egyptian Government in the immediately foreseeable future would be prepared to abandon, and although most Egyptian politicians wouldbe willing to concede some form of self-government to the Sudan, few are ready to define what degree of self-government would in fact be granted, and fewer stillare aware of the strength of anti-Egyptian feeling among the Independence Partyin the Sudan. So long as the Egyptians remain intransigent on this issue, there is little hope of an Anglo-Egyptian settlement about the Sudan. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment stands committed to a clearly defined policy, publicly announced inParliament in 1946 and confirmed by my statement made in Parliament on20th November, that the Sudanese people must be allowed freely to decide theirown future. Two attempts have been made since the war to reconcile Anglo-Egyptian differences in this matter, notably in 1946; on both occasions greaterconcessions were made to Egypt than the present state of Sudanese opinion would allow; and each time the Egyptian Government withheld its approval after theagreement had been initialled ad referendum. In existing circumstances, therefore,there is nothing to be gained by reopening negotiations regarding the Sudan.Meanwhile, the Governor-General is being encouraged to press forward measures designed to broaden the electoral basis of the Sudan Legislative Assembly.
m^the suez Canal20.   In order to preserve the principle of &quot; the free use of the Canal in warI as in peace &quot; enshrined in the Suez Canal Convention of 1888, the Royal Navy have i taken pains in both world wars to exercise belligerent rights of inspection andI contraband control outside the Canal.  Since 15th May, 1948, however, successive1 Egyptian Governments have claimed the right to exercise these rights within theI Canal, quoting Article X of the Convention. The relevant part of this Article states &quot;that the provisions of Articles IV, V, VII and VIII (i.e., those which dealI specifically with the rights of belligerent nations in the Canal in time of war); shallg not interfere with measures ... . .&quot; which the Egyptian Government &quot;might findi it necessary to take for securing by their own forces the defence of Egypt and theI maintenance of public order.&quot; The Egyptian Government, moreover, continue toI exercise these rights in respect of a limited contraband list in practice, arms andI oil-even though Egypt is to all intents and purposes at peace with Israel, withI whom she signed in February 1949 a permanent Armistice.21. His Majesty&apos;s Government have on numerous occasions protested to the1 Egyptian Government against the restrictions on the free use of the Canal. while these representations, supplemented by those of other maritime Powers, have i undoubtedly helped to reduce frivolous interference with shipping and have contri-I buted to the progressive relaxation of the Egyptian restrictions, they have notI induced the Egyptian Government to remove the restrictions altogether. DespiteI the many efforts we have made to persuade the Egyptian Government that theI continuance of the restrictions is even more damaging to neutral countries and tof themselves than it is to Israel, they have remained deaf to our arguments. It is clearI that the Egyptian Government, in common with the Iraqi Government, who have i suspended operation of the Haifa pipeline, regard the interdiction of oil traffic toI Haifa as a major point in their policy towards Israel.j. 22. Our material interests at stake are, first, claims for confiscated cargoesp&apos; and demurrage to ships between May 1948 and July 1949, amounting to somer i\ million. The Egyptian Government have been formally made aware that weI are holding this claim against them, although it has not yet been presented in fullyk documented form. Second, the partial inaction of the Haifa refineries, despite theI routeing of some tankers to Haifa via the Cape, is costing the United Kingdom aI substantial, though not precisely calculable, indirect loss of hard currency. ThisIP may be of the value of  18,000,000 annually.m 23. Our protests to the Egyptian Government were based on the twoI contentions -p (1) that the situation in Palestine was not such as to confer on Egypt belligerentI rights, andjl (2) that even if she were entitled to such rights, she could not exercise them inj the Canal.tj Although these arguments were used with the Egyptian Government in theI] immediate interests of restoring liberty of navigation in the Canal, some doubts aroseH as to the legal validity of the underlying assumptions, and the legal issues involvedI&quot; were submitted to the Law Officers.24. The Law Officers&apos; conclusions, which may be studied in greater detailI at the Annex, were broadly that not only did the situation in Palestine from1 15th May, 1948, onward, for all practical purposes constitute a state of war, butI that Egypt was entitled to search for and seize contraband in the Canal on theI grounds that such action was justified by the requirements of self-defence. TheI Law Officers consider, however, that Egypt may, in the method of executing herI control, have exceeded the legitimate requirements of self-defence, and also thatI as the date of the Armistice recedes, her justification for continuing the restrictionsI becomes less and less. We have heard that the United States State DepartmentsI Legal Advisers have come independently to much the same conclusion. Our new-I found doubts have naturally not been revealed to the Egyptian Government, but1 it is evident that, assuming Egypt agreed to submit to the International Court, His1 Majesty&apos;s Governments chances of winning their case are not sufficiently favour-1 able.to be worth the risk of failure, with all its implications&apos; I      25.   Two months ago Israel raised the question of the Egyptian economic blockade, which naturally includes the Canal restrictions, as a complaint against
Egypt in the Security Council. It subsequently transpired that this issue hadaunknown to the members of&apos; the Security Cpuhdl,:been&apos; raised previously in theEgyptian/Israeli Mixed Armistice Commission^ although the Commission had nevergiven a final decision in the.case. The Security Council has just ruled that this,together with various other Israeli and Arab complaints, should be dealt with bythe Palestine Conciliation machinery within the next jhree months arid that GeneralRiley&quot; should inform: them at the end of that period what action had been takento enforce the Commissions&apos; decisions. The matter is therefore in a sense subjudrce. - If the Mixed Armistice Commission rules that the restrictions are contraryto the Armistice Settlement and Egypt defies it, it will be up to the Security Council,with all the moral influence at its command, to consider how the Commission^decision is to be enforced. In the meantime we have tried but failed to persuade the Egyptian Government to abolish the restrictions rather than risk an adverseruling in the Security Council, and as there does not appear much more that wecan do for the present by direct approach to the Egyptian Government, I think we must let developments take their course.Financial Negotiations26. Egypt has progressively drawn down her sterling balances accumulatedduring the last war, and these now stand at  270 million, of which  40 million are on free account and the remainder blocked. Since 1947 releases of blocked sterlingto Egypt and allocations of hard currency have been regulated by separate annualagreements reached only after long and increasingly difficult negotiations. Thisyear, as part of the price of an agreement, we were obliged to undertake to open negotiations in November for a &quot; long-term or permanent settlement of Egypt&apos;ssterling balances.&quot;27. A full statement of the problem and suggestions for its solution are inthe memorandum which received the general approval of the Economic PolicyCommittee on 24th November, 1950. Three possible kinds of settlement areenvisaged:  (a) A settlement based on a development approach, modelled on the Colomboplan;(b) Automatic annual releases unconnected with development; and(c) A combination of these two.Of these, the first is preferable for several reasons, not least because it is the onlyone which holds out hope that future releases of sterling to the Egyptian Govern-ment would be used to improve the economic condition of the Egyptian people andso contribute to the general stability of the Middle East.28. The political repercussions of failure to conclude a financial agreement should not be underestimated. The alternatives would be either, at best, a returnto the system of annual financial haggles, or, at worst, an economic war with Egypt.The former has over the past few years acted as a constant irritant in Anglo-Egyptian relations, and the effects of the latter in the political, quite apart fromthe economic field, would be grave. It cannot, however, be said that failure to conclude a long-term or permanent financial settlement with the Egyptian Govern-ment would make it impossible to secure a defence agreement.Conclusions29. As regards the Sudan, the overriding importance of defence should neverprevent us from fulfilling our declared obligation towards the people of the Sudan,and the Sudan Government should be given all possible aid in preparing the sudanese for a free decision regarding their country&apos;s future.30. The overriding factor in defence discussions with Egypt should be our determination to take no step which will leave the Middle East defenceless andheedlessly endanger the independence and safety of other countries in the area.The alternative courses of action outlined in paragraph 13 above should be reviewed again in the light of the forthcoming conversations with the Egyptian ForeignMinister. In general, we should maintain our efforts to reach a satisfactory defence agreement. If these efforts fail, we should take our stand on the 1936 treaty and be prepared to accept a general deterioration in Anglo-Egyptian relations, and
if necessary to defy consequent Egyptian attempts to force us by administrativeobstruction to leave the Suez Canal Zone. ,31. Our secondary aims should remain unaltered. In particular we shouldhandle the Suez Canal and Sterling Balance problems on the lines indicated in para-graphs 25 and 27 of this paper. Pursuit of these aims should not, however, beallowed substantially to modify our main objective as regards defence.. ,   &quot; E. B.Foreign Office, SWA,21th November, 1950.

[is  document IS  the   property  of  his  britannic  ma.iesty&apos;s  governmentISECRETCopy No.ANNEXEGYPT32JE 1425/34No.[11th May, 1950]Foreign Office to the Law Officers of the CrownForeign Office, S. W. 1,Gentlemen, &apos;        15th April, 1950.Beginning on 15th May, 1948, and in connexion with the Palestine conflict, The palestine the Egyptian Government have been visiting and searching in the Suez Canal Egyptianvessels of all nations exercising the right to passage through the Suez Canal Contrabandsecured by the Suez Canal Convention.  The visit and search are for the purpose suezCanaL118of ascertaining whether the vessels carry material destined for Israel which mightassist Israel in the Palestine conflict.   Where material of this character hasbeen found, it has been seized and the vessels carrying it have been detained fora longer or shorter period for it to be off-loaded.   This practice has continuedsince the armistices concluded between February and August 1949 under the auspices of the United Nations between Egypt and the other Arab States on theone hand and Israel on the other hand, though in a somewhat diminished form.From the manner in which Egypt has taken these measures, which included the setting up of a prize court, it is clear that Egypt is purporting to exercise inthe canal in the circumstances of the Palestine conflict the belligerent right of stopping contraband going to its enemies.  At the present time, this Egyptianpractice is causing particular difficulty by preventing the transport of oil fromthe Persian Gulf to the Haifa refinery now in Israel.  The Iraq Government arepreventing the passage of oil down the pipe line from Iraq to Haifa so that withthe Egyptian Government preventing oil from reaching the Haifa refinery bytanker passing through the Suez Canal, the Haifa refinery is now idle.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government and other Powers have challenged Egypt&apos;right.to take this action in diplomatic notes addressed to the Egyptian Govern-ment and have reserved the right to claim damages. In reply, Egypt has assertedher confidence in the lawfulness of her actions under the Suez Canal convention and International Law. These measures taken by the Egyptian Government have caused damage to a large number of British shipping companies whose ships havebeen held up and also to British commercial concerns, the owners of cargoes whichhave been seized or delayed, as also to British insurance companies. If theEgyptian action is unlawful, there are grounds for large diplomatic claims for damages, and large claims have been lodged by British interests with HisMajesty&apos;s Government.3. The diplomatic correspondence has led to no agreement and though one country, Norway, has indicated the possibility that it might bring the matter before the Security Council of the United Nations, Norway has not, in fact, taken this action. Having regard particularly to the present situation relating to theHaifa refinery referred to above, the matter has been before the Economic Com-mittee of the Cabinet, with the result that it has been decided to obtain youradvice on the matter.4.   In substance, there appear to be two questions, namely : (1) Is it lawful for Egypt to exercise in the Carnal against vessels passing through the Canal the ordinary belligerent rights with regard tocontraband, assuming that she is at war and that all other circum-stances exist, which would justify this action as being necessary forthe defence of Egypt if the permissibility of the action depends onthis j ustification ?16266   39017 b
(2) If the answer to (1) is in the affirmative, is Egypt entitled to exercise!)these rights in the circumstances in which she has exercised thernduring the Palestinian conflict and is now exercising them?5. The first of these questions depends on the interpretation of the suez canal Convention. The second question depends on the appreciation of thecircumstances of the Palestinian conflict. Both these questions are dealt with inthe annexed Paper No. 1, which consists of a long memorandum by Mr. A.McDougall, formerly Legal Counsellor at Cairo and at present a temporaryAssistant Legal Adviser in the Foreign Office. Annexed at the end of thismemorandum is a printed paper which contains the full text of the Suez CanalConvention.6. On the first question, Mr. McDougaH&apos;s memorandum suggests the con-clusion that on the interpretation of the Suez Canal Convention itself, in thelight of preparatory work of the conference which drew it up, the answer to question (1) should be in the affirmative (Section D of the memorandum, especiallyparagraph 16). This conclusion is reinforced by an examination of what other action the history of the canal shows to have been taken and which must be presumed to have been lawfully taken and by a comparison of such action withthe action now under discussion (Section D, especially paragraphs 30-31).7. On the other hand, it must be admitted that this conclusion is different from the view which His Majesty&apos;s Government took in the first world war andfollowed in the second world war (Sections E and F of the memorandum). Theinternational law books do not help for they confine themselves to citing theprovisions of the Suez Canal Convention or saying that the canal is &quot; neutralised,&quot;one only (Higgins &amp; Colombos, International Law of the Sea, page 753) referringspecifically to the right of visit and search in this connexion, and then only tothe extent of pointing out that the canal has been placed upon the same footing as neutral territorial waters, that is, waters in which other countries may not exercise that right.8. It is not quite clear exactly how His Majesty&apos;s Government, in thefirst world war, came to take the view on this point which they must have done,but it may be said that, given the British naval position in that war, it may nothave been of very great practical importance to His Majesty&apos;s government whether vessels were searched and seized for contraband in the canal itself orthree miles outside the terminal ports. It may be, therefore, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, who found it necessary to take in relation to the Suez Canal anumber of other measures (such as the closing of the canal for periods) which,though probably lawful, might have been challenged, wished to limit to theminimum action with regard to the canal which might conceivably be open tolegal challenge.9. In the second World War, there seems little reason to doubt that nofurther examination was given to the legal position and action was based on theconclusion apparently reached in the first World War, and this, notwithstanding the fact that the whole legal basis for action by His Majesty&apos;s Government inrelation to the Suez Canal in the second World War was a slightly differentone from that which it had been in the first World War. Though the legal basis for such action by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the second World War wasdifferent, it is not suggested that this made any difference to the type of actionwhich might be taken or not taken. This aspect of the matter is particularlyconsidered in paragraphs 20 to 30 of Section C and Sections E and P ofMr. McDougalPs memorandum.10. It was only when in the Palestine conflict Egypt, acting on her own,took action against contraband in the Canal, and thus doing something from whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government had refrained during the two world wars, and main-tained her right to do so against representations made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and other Governments, that the matter was submitted to a freshlegal examination. In their representations to Egypt, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave proceeded on the basis that the limitation which they had put on theirown actions in two world wars had been a legally necessary limitation- Indeed,this limitation on action in the Canal, based as it was on the practice of twoworld wars and not contradicted at any rate in the general International Lawbooks, was almost assumed to have the truth of a legal axiom and in consequencelegal consideration of the matter first took the form rather of finding the support-ing reasons for something which was assumed as an axiom rather than that of
($an investigation into the validity of a proposition assumed as axiomatic. as time went on, however, it became obviously necessary to investigate the soundnessof what had been assumed as axiomatic. Thus, and as a result of fresh examina-tion doubts began to grow, leading to the ultimate result in the enclosed memo-randum by Mr. McDougali, in which the conclusion is reached that the propositionis, in fact, probably not well founded.11. Question (2) would appear only to arise if question (1) is answered inthe affirmative. Here in brief the position seems to be that under the Suez CanalConvention (Articles IX and X) the special rights of Egypt as a territorial power,given in those articles, are not limited to times of war. Therefore, the legality of much of her action in the Suez Canal depends on whether it could be justified as reasonably necessary for the defence of Egypt or the Suez Canal. On the otherhand, the right of preventing contraband from going to an enemy is a rightwhich, under general international law, can only be exercised by a State at war,and the question, therefore, arises in the particular circumstances of the Palestineconflict whether Egypt, who has never actually declared war and does not even now profess to recognise Israel as a State, has the right to exercise it. (Thisis dealt with in Section G of Mr. McDougalFs memorandum.)12. The enclosed memorandum is long and it is hoped- that it includes allthe material necessary for your consideration of the questions put to you. In an endeavour to avoid burdening you with excessive reading, the minutes of the1885 Conference which drew up the text of what is now the Suez Canal convention are not enclosed, though they are discussed in the memorandum and the relevantportions are quoted. Similarly, I have not enclosed copies of the notes exchangedwith the Egyptian Government with regard to this matter. So far as question (1)is concerned the Egyptian Government and their notes roundly assert that their action is justified by their position as a territorial power and by Article 10 of theConvention. The Egyptian contention is, however, in general terms. Little helpwas derived from the Egyptian notes in the production of the portion of thememorandum which deals with the first question. On the other hand, in regardto the second question, the Egyptian Government did explain its position more fully in its notes, but the Egyptian statements on this point are reproduced orsummarised in the memorandum itself. If, however, you should desire to see theminutes of the Conference, copies of the notes exchanged or any other material in this connexion, it can be supplied to you.13.

E. BECKETT.List of Papers1. Foreign Office Memorandum (Mr. A. McDougali).2.   Admiralty, 15th April, 1950.j 1425/34 Opinion .   .Sir,&quot;We are honoured with your commands signified to us in Sir Eric Becketfsletter of 15th April, 1950, requesting us to advise on certain questions in con-nection with the Palestine conflict and the powers of the Egyptian Governmentto visit and search in the Suez Canal vessels of all nations exercising the rightof passage through the Suez Canal, secured by the Suez Canal Convention.We are asked to advise : (i) Whether Egypt may lawfully exercise in the Suez Canal Zone againstvessels passing through it the ordinary belligerent rights in regard tocontraband of war, assuming that Egypt is at war and that theexercise of such rights is necessary to the defence of Egypt; and39017 b 2
(ii) If the answer to (i) is in the affirmative whether the circumstancesexisting in connection with the Palestine conflict are such as to entitle.Egypt to exercise such rights.We have had the advantage of reading the elaborate examination of thematter by Mr. McDougall and have given consideration to the weighty and cogentreasoning which he advances. It cannot be doubted that the arguments are nicelybalanced and that it is impossible to advise with any great confidence which ofthe two main opposing views in regard to the substance of the matter would themore commend itself to the International Court of Justice. We have, however,come to the conclusion that Egypt can exercise a right of search for and seizure of contraband provided she does not do so in a manner which interferes unduly withthe free passage of peaceful shipping in the sense which we later describe.1. The Suez Canal is an integral part of the now Sovereign State of Egypt.When the original Firman dealing with the construction of the Canal was issuedby the Khedive in 1854 it was stipulated that the Canal should form part of theterritory of Egypt. Subsequent practice and various international declarationsleave no doubt that subject to the effect of the convention constituting the Canalan international waterway, the Canal is an Egyptian internal water. At thetime of the Convention in 1888, however, Egypt was under the suzerainty of theold Ottoman Empire and, on the other hand, British troops were in occupationof various parts of her territory, as in fact they have remained ever since. Indeed,the circumstances were such that the British Government made a reservation insigning the Convention which in the result prevented the Convention coming intooperation until 1904 when a joint Declaration of the French and British Govern-ments agreed to the Convention being put into force subject to certain reserva-tions, not material to the matter now under advisement, to which the Conventionmust, we think, since be regarded as being subject. Egypt became recognised asa Sovereign Independent State by virtue of the British Declaration of 1922 andthe Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, Turkish suzerainty being extinguished bythe Treaty of Lausanne after the 1914/1918 war, during which Egypt was madea British protectorate. We do not think, however, that Egypt succeeded to therights previously enjoyed by the Ottoman Empire, under the express provisionsof the Convention of 1888. Egypt has, since becoming a Sovereign State, expresslyrecognised that the Convention of 1888 is still in force and we think that she is bound by it, references to Egypt and the Khedive being read as references towhat is now a Sovereign State and such rights as the Convention gives to Egypt,as for instance under Article X, are exercisable by her in her own right.2. In the protracted negotiations which led up to the final conclusion ofthe Convention there is no doubt that one of the main preoccupations of thePowers concerned was to find a way in which the free use of the Canal couldbe reconciled with the right, which seems to have been well recognised, of theTerritorial Power to defend her territory. We do not think that too much relianceshould be placed on these travaux preparatoires in construing what was eventuallyagreed upon, but in so far as they do form any useful guide to what was meantthey assist the conclusion we have ourselves reached. Nor do we think there is anything in the somewhat general resolutions of the Security Council which wouldentitle Egypt to exercise, for her own advantage in the very conflict those resolu-tions were intended to suppress, rights of search or seizure which she did not otherwise possess.3. Subject to those comments, the matter seems to us to depend entirely uponthe construction to be put upon the Convention of 1888 in regard to the Canal,considered as an integral part of a Sovereign State but at the same time aninternational waterway. Article 1 of the Convention must we think be regardedas governing the whole of the operation of the Convention : it is intended toestablish the international status of the waterway. The Canal is to be &apos;c free and open &apos;&apos; to vessels of commerce or of war &apos;&apos; without distinction of Flag &apos;&apos; andthe high contracting Parties agree &apos;&apos; not in any way to interfere with the freeuse of the Canal in time of war as in time of peace.&quot; The Canal was never to be subjected to the exercise of the right of blockade. These apparently wide butgeneral provisions of Article I were either extended or, for the removal of doubtfurther particularised, by Article IV, which stipulated that the high contractingParties agreed that &apos;&apos; no right of war; nor act of hostility, nor any act havingfor its object to obstruct the free navigation of the canal should be committed in
the canal . . . . &quot; and Article V provided that belligerent powers should not dis-embark or embark troops within the Canal. The question now is to what extentthese very wide and general provisions to maintain the free and international status of the Canal must be regarded as modified by those Articles X and XI which for the protection of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, provided that the provisionsof Articles IV, V, VII and VIII should not interfere with the measures whichEgypt might find it necessary to take for the defence of Egypt and the main-tenance of public order. It is to be observed, however, that Article I was not included within the scope of this exception and that, indeed, Article XI expresslystipulated that the measures taken must not interfere with the free use of the canal. It is most difficult to reconcile the meaning of these apparently incon-sistent articles. In our view the International Court would interpret them without undue technicality and with some regard to the Territorial integrity ofthe State of Egypt. We think it would be open to the Court on that broad viewto conclude that Article X contemplated the situation when, in time of war theterritorial security of Egypt might be threatened by the existence of an otherwisecompletely free and uncontrolled international waterway through her territory.Article IV expressly prohibited the exercise of any right of war or act of hostilityand it may be that the signatory Powers did not consider that the exercise ofsuch rights would be sufficiently excluded by the general language of Article I.On the other hand, Article X, subject to Article XI, suspends the operation ofthis exclusion of rights of war in favour of such measures as Egypt may find it necessary to take for securing the defence of Egypt, Article XI restricting the scope of this exclusion to measures which do not interfere with the free useof the Canal. But subject to this limitation, the effect of Article X must wethink be that Egypt can exercise rights of war necessary to her defence. Themost obvious rights of war are, in this context, the right of search and seizure.On the whole Ave think that the combined effect of these Articles is to enableEgypt to exercise, against any country with which she is at war, or against anyother country, so far as so to do would otherwise be consistent with her positionas a belligerent, rights of war which do not otherwise interfere with the freeuse of the Canal. She may, subject to what is said hereafter, search all ships :she may only seize contraband cargoes or detain ships which are hostile. Shemay not blockade the canal or restrain the passage of innocent ships. Somemeaning must be given to Article X. We find it difficult to believe that the Inter-national Court would regard the Convention as entitling foreign powers, although not themselves at war with Egypt, to transport men or contraband of war throughEgyptian territory to some field of warlike operations where they could be usedto endanger the territorial security of Egypt, still less as enabling actually hostilepowers so to do. The Canal is to be free. But that freedom is not to be usedto the prejudice of Egypt&apos;s defence. Egypt may exercise rights of war, providedshe leaves the Canal free to ships using it on peaceful occasions.4. On this view it becomes a question of fact whether the measures ofsearch and seizure as now being exercised by Egypt constitute in this sense aninterference with the free use of the Canal. We should require rather furtherinformation as to the facts to enable us to reach any firm conclusion but on thefacts before us we incline to the view that they do. The interference with thefree pasage of the Canal must not be incommensurate with the sole justification for such interference the exercise of rights of war in defence of Egypt. If inthe exercise of the right of search ships not carrying contraband are being subjected to undue delay, or if the methods of search are such as to deter innocentshipping from the use of the Canal, we think that Egypt is going beyond thatwhich is permitted under Article X only to the extent that, under Article XI, itdoes not interfere with the free use of the Canal. The matter is one of degreebut we should have thought that it should have been possible to conduct the search for contraband expeditiously, perhaps at the same time as the sanitary examina-tion. If, on the contrary, ships are subjected to prolonged delays, we considerthat this is not justifiable.5. We turn now to the second question. This can be dealt with shortly.Although Egypt has not recognised the State of Israel as having any juristicexistence we feel little doubt that the circumstances existing during the Palestinedispute and at the present time constitute a war for the purpose of entitling egypt to exercise rights of war within the meaning of Article X. Israel had in fact been recognised by some States and was, before the Armistice, in a position to
wage what, for all practical purposes, the Security Council regarded as a war.Here again we think that the International Court would not allow the manifestrealities of the situation to be obscured by any over nice or academic argument.We have, &amp;e.HARTLEY SHAWCROSS.FRANK SOSKICE.Law Officers&apos; Department,11th May, 1950Paper No. 1The Palestine Conflict; Egyptian Contraband Control in the Suez CanalThis Memorandum contains the following sections : -A.-The Questions to be answered.B.-Summary of the Facts.C.

The Legal questions the opinion of the Law Officers is desired as to what would be the decisionof the International Court of Justice if the following questions of law were, by whatever means, submitted to it : I. Would Egypt, if she were at war, be violating the Suez Canal convention of 1888, by requiring ships in transit through the Suez Canal to submit to visit and search and by removing cargo held to be contraband, and by condemning suchcargo held to be contraband, or requisitioning ,cargo not held to be contraband ?The question may be put more precisely as follows :-Would Egypt by such action illegally interfere with &quot; the free use ofthe Canal &quot; contemplated in the Preamble, and provided for in Article I and article XI of the Convention?More precisely still the question may be put as follows : Is Egypt authorised by Article X of the Convention to exercise the rightof visit in the Canal in its own defence, and is &quot; the free use of the Canal&quot;therefore qualified by the right of the territorial Power to do this in timeof war ?II. Was, and is, Egypt entitled in the circumstances of the Palestineconflict to take the steps referred to in Question I ?B-The FactsThe British Mandate for Palestine ended at midnight 14th-15th May, 1948.On 15th May, 1948, the Egyptian armed forces entered Palestine for the avowedpurpose of putting down Zionist terrorism.   The same day a state of siege was
(I proclaimed in Egypt and a system of inspection was imposed on ships in Egyptianports, including Port Said and Suez (Notice of 18th May), that they did not include munitions or goods of any kind destined directly or indirectly for any-one in Palestine. If found, such goods were to be dealt with in accordance with international law and conficated in appropriate cases. On 6th June, a similar treatment was imposed on goods exported from Palestine, and on 28th June pro-vision was made for requisitioning against compensation goods which were notconfiscable. On 8th July, a Prize Court (Prize Council) was established. On29th June, 1949, in view of the armistice, the definition of contraband was limited,and the prize rules were relaxed, but a large number of categories of goods,including petroleum, still remain subject to condemnation as contraband and thePrize Council continues in operation. (Further details are given in Section G.)2.   During the Palestine conflict the Egyptian Government has therefore : (a) in effect, forbidden the transportation of &quot; contraband of war &quot; throughthe Canal;(b) searched ships in the Canal for contraband, delaying them for thispurpose;(c) seized cargoes from such ships on the ground that they were contraband;(d) sent cargoes to the Egyptian Prize Council for adjudication;(e) claimed the right to requisition cargoes not condemned as prize;and it continues to act in this way.3. The Egyptian Government claims the right to do these things in defenceof Egypt. It claims also that the Palestine conflict has produced what amounts in law to a state of war, although it has refused to recognise the Zionists ofPalestine as a Government or Israel as a State in international law. TheEgyptian Government still prohibits on pain of seizure the passage of &apos;&apos; absolutecontraband,&quot; including petroleum, through the Canal. The passage through the canal of oil from the Persian Gulf required for the economic operation of theBritish-owned Haifa refinery in Israel and the supply to the United Kingdom andother countries of refined products from sterling area resources, continues to beobstructed for this reason.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government and other Governments have protestedvigorously and repeatedly to the Egyptian Government against the action takenin the Canal, and have reserved their right to claim damages.5. Claims against the Egyptian Government running into some millions of pounds sterling have been lodged by British nationals (individuals and companies)with His Majesty&apos;s Government on account of losses due to : (a) delay of ships in transit through the Canal, and(&amp;) seizure of cargoes.These claims have been made by British owners of ships and cargoes and Britishinsurance companies and associations. If the Egyptian Governments actions areillegal there may be further claims lodged with His Majesty&apos;s Government onaccount of losses due to : (c) denial of the use of the Canal to ships carrying what the Egyptian Gov-ernment treats as contraband, with the consequence that ships havebeen re-routed or more expensive supplies of e.g., petroleum, have hadto be sought elsewhere, or consignments which in the ordinary courseof international trade would have been made, have not been made at all.The presumptions as to enemy destination applied by the Egyptian Government onthe basis of rules enforced by His Majesty&apos;s Government during the late war have probably caused a substantial interruption of normal trade. Claims under (c)might, therefore, prove to be large.6. The question is whether the Egyptian Government is justified in thecircumstances of the Palestine conflict in doing what it has done and is doing inthe Suez Canal ports. Broadly speaking, the Egyptian Governments acts arelike those committed in war on the high seas by a belligerent. The character of belligerent the Egyptian Government at first rejected but very soon assumed.His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, have not admitted that Egypt is entitledin the Palestine conflict to exercise belligerent rights at sea. One question, there-fore, is whether the situation arising out of the Palestine conflict is one (whetherit is legally a state of war or not) which justifies the Egyptian Government in
exercising &quot;belligerent&quot; rights. Egypt naturally tries to justify the exercise 1of the right of stopping contraband and putting it into a Prize Court for con-condemnation on the basis that she is at war, because the form which she has givento her actions has been that of the exercise of the maritime rights of a belligerent.However, if pressed that her non-recognition of Israel as a State creates for hera certain difficulty in her contention that she is at war, she might try to justifyher actions on the alternative argument that her actions were not taken at seabut in Egyptian internal waters for the safety and defence of Egypt. this alternative argument has two difficulties to surmount,(a) that the Suez Canal convention appears to assimilate the Canal toterritorial waters;(&amp;) that Egypt has in fact by her own decrees put her action on a maritimebasis (contraband prize court), &amp;c.7. The question of war or no war probably cannot be answered with complete assurance. The nature of the hostilities, the successive truces, theexisting armistice, the admission of Israel to the United Nations, and the attitudesand actions of the various Governments engaged in the hostilities, are facts infavour of the view that Egypt was and is at war to set against Egypfs logicaldifficulty that war means a state of hostilities between States and Egypt doesnot admit that her enemy is a State. Some consideration is given below(Section G, paragraphs 17-33), to the Egyptian Governments possible alternativeargument, but it is convenient to deal first with Question I, which proceeds on theassumption that war exists, for if the Egyptian Government has acted illegally,notwithstanding a state of war, it has almost certainly acted illegally if no warexists.8. Question II can then be considered on the assumption that Question i must be answered in the affirmative and Question II therefore involves thepoints-:   (i) Is Egypt at war ?(ii) If not, is she legally entitled to exercise the rights referred to inQuestion I.fi. The Suez Canal Convention of 18881. To appreciate the purpose and meaning of the Convention, a briefhistorical review is important.2. In 1856, in advance of its construction, the Suez Canal with its ports of access was declared by the Khedive of Egypt to be open at all times as a neutralpassage to the merchant ships of all nations without discrimination, and in 1866the Sultan of Turkey ratified this declaration.3. In 1869 the Canal was opened to traffic and warships as well as merchant ships were allowed to use it. In the Pranco-Prussian War of 1870 and in the russo--Turkish War of 1877-78, even the warships of belligerents were allowedto do so. In the latter war His Majesty&apos;s Government required of and receivedfrom the Russian and Turkish Governments assurances that the Canal wouldnot be attacked or be made the scene of hostilities.4. In 1882 Arabi Pasha&apos;s revolt in Egypt brought about the virtualdestruction of Khedivial authority, and threatened the security of the Canal.In default of intervention by the other Great Powers or even Turkey (the suzerainPower), Great Britain intervened alone, occupied the Canal with military and naval forces, defeated Arabi Pasha and began the military occupation of Egyptwhich was not formally ended until 1936, and then only on terms permittingBritish forces to remain in Egypt, as they still do, for the protection of the Canal.5. Early in 1883 the British Government took the initiative with the otherGreat Powers of Europe, and Turkey, for the conclusion of an international agree-ment to secure the free navigation of the Canal at all times and its freedom fromobstruction or damage by acts of war. The British Government stated that themeasures taken by them in 1882 for protecting the navigation and the use of the canal were in no way infringements of this principle. One basic provision of theplan outlined was that it should not restrict measures necessary for the defenceof Egypt. Another was that the duty of enforcing the Convention would fall inthe first place on Egypt.6. In March 1885 the Great Powers and Turkey were in conference inParis to settle the financial difficulties of Egypt and they agreed upon the urgency
of negotiating a Convention guaranteeing at all times and for all Powers thefree use of the Canal. A Commission of representatives of the Powers was immediately established and so began the negotiations which led after long,arduous and meticulous discussion of almost every word and its meaning, to the signature of the Convention on 29th October, and its ratification on 22nd Decem-ber, 1888. A copy of the English translation of the convention is to be found inthe Printed paper at the end of this memo. A copy of the original French textcan be easily supplied. If it not thought, however, that anything turns on the exact meaning of particular words so as to render a reference to the Frenchoriginal text essential.7. The main lines of the Convention which was eventually signed are thosedrawn by the 1885 Commission, but the draft it adopted was Objectionable toHis Majesty&apos;s Government, particularly because of its provision for collectivesupervision by the powers of its execution and the restriction it imposed uponthe territorial Powers&apos; making use of the aid of allies in the defence of Egypt.At the end of the Commission^ work the British delegate tabled a draft which left Egypt free of all restrictions on measures necessary for her defence, making,moreover a general reservation regarding British freedom of action during theoccupation of Egypt even if the British draft should be accepted.8. The Commission^ draft set out the principle of freedom of use of the canal for all ships of commerce and of war in time of war as in time of peace, andthe mutual undertaking of the Parties not to interfere with this free use(cf. Article I of the Convention). The draft then set out the rules governingwarships and prohibiting warlike activity in the Canal, substantially as they appear in the Convention (cf. Articles IV-VII). Then followed a provision fora permanent international Commission in Egypt to supervise the execution of theTreaty (cf. Article VIII). The next two articles dispensed the territorial Rulers(the Khedive of Egypt and his suzerain the Sultan of Turkey) from observingthe restrictions in the preceding articles, when taking measures for the defenceof the Canal or the defence of Egypt and the maintenance of public order(cf. Article IX and X). Then followed an article (cf. Article XI) to the effectthat measures taken under the two preceding articles should not interfere withthe free use of the Canal. The remaining articles of the draft were also muchlike those in the Convention as ultimately signed.9. During the next two years, with the consent of the other Powers, nego-tiations to resolve the differences between the United Kingdom on the one handand all the other Powers on the other hand (paragraph 7 above) were carried onbetween the French and British Government. The most important principlesestablished by these discussions were : (1) Breach of the Convention by any Party would release all other Parties.The Convention was not a joint and several guarantee. Subject tothis principle,(2) the Canal for the purposes of the Convention would comprise the water-way only and would not include any land not covered by water;(3) What was to be prohibited in the Canal was to be prohibited to Turkey(and Egypt) equally with the other Signatories except as providedotherwise in Convention;(4) The enforcement Of the Convention (which includes the duty of ensuring that the Canal is freely open to all users) would be secured in the firstplace by the territorial Rulers, and in the second place by the other signatories;(5) For the enforcement of the Convention (see Article IX) Turkey (and egypt) would not be entitled to make use of the help of -allies oftheir choice;(6) For the defence of Egypt, Turkey (and Egypt) would be free to make useof the help of any allies they might have, since the need for allies would, it was assumed, arise only in the case of a breach of theConvention by one of the Parties (of (1) above and vide also Article X);(7) The British Government would maintain their general reservation as tothe application of.the provisions of the Convention in so far as theyshould be incompatible with the temporary and exceptional situation of Egypt and in so far as they might interfere with their liberty ofaction during the period of the occupation of Egypt by British Forces.39017 c
10. In October 1887 a re-draft of the Convention, was agreed by the twoGovernments and was submitted to the other prospective signatories together witha formal reiteration of the British Governmenfs reservation of freedom of action(i.e., (7) of preceding paragraph).11. During the last stage of the negotiations the Turkish Governmentobtained the addition to Article X of a third paragraph giving Turkey, in takingmeasures Tor the defence of her possessions on the east coast of the Red Sea, thesame freedom from restrictions earlier in the Convention as she already enjoyedunder the then existing text of that Article for the defence of Egypt. Thisaddition was only reluctantly accorded, and was understood to entitle her to exclude enemy ships from the Canal. The rights of Turkey as the territorialPower were expressly reserved in Article XII and the rights as well as theimmunities of Egypt were expressly saved in Article XIII.12. The Convention thus finally concluded is an agreement between theparties to it that the Canal shall always be free and open, and that none of them(including the territorial Power) will interfere with the free use of the Canalin war or peace and will never blockade it (Article I). Article IV expressly for-bids the commission in the canai (including its ports of access and three milesfrom those ports) of any right of war (an expression which includes visit and search, removal and condemnation of contraband) of any act of hostility, or ofany act aimed at obstructing the free navigation of the Canal, even though theterritorial Power is one of the belligerents. (&apos;) It includes other provisionsexpressly requiring belligerent warships to pass through quickly and limitingtheir revictualling. Article V prohibits disembarking or embarking troops and munitions in the Canal in time of war. Article VII forbids the Powers to keepany warships in the Canai except for two stationhaires at the ports of accessand even those may not be maintained by belligerents. Articles IX and X, how-ever, expressly exempt Turkey and Egypt from the prohibitions of Articles IV,V, VII and VIII when they find it necessary to take measures either for ensuring the execution of the Treaty (which is primarily the protection of the Canal(Article IX) and for securing by their own forces the defence of egypt and the maintenance of order there (Article X). Then follows Article XI,(the interpretation of which is probably the crux of the question) providing that what is done under the two preceding articles &apos;&apos; shall not inter-fere with the (fairs obstacle au) free use of the Canal.&quot; It is thus that the first question in the present case is reduced to what is the true meaning of &quot; the freeuse of the Canal,&quot; or in other words whether the exercise in the Canal of visit and search, removal and condemnation of contraband is an interference with thefree use of the Canal.13. Until 1904, the convention remained in obeyance because the Britishreservation (see paragraph 10 above) was regarded as preventing it from cominginto operation though signed and ratified. As part of the Anglo-French Agree-ment of 8th April, 1904, (the Entente Cordiale) His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdeclared that they had &quot; no intention of altering the political status of Egypt &quot;;the French Government declared that it would &apos;&apos; not obstruct the action of GreatBritain in that country by asking that a limit of time be fixed for the Britishoccupation or in any other manner.&quot; In return, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdeclared :&quot;In order to insure the free passage of the Suez Canal, His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government declare that they adhere to the stipulations of the) The Canal is really an Egyptian internal waterway. It is not Egyptian territorial waters.Yet it would seem that to some extent the Convention assimilates the Canal to Egyptian territorial waters when it forbids in Article IV the exercise in the Canal of &quot; rights of war &quot; (which was stated in the minutes to include the visit and search of vessels).In the ordinary way a State may exercise the belligerent right of visit and search (1) onthe high seas (2) in territorial waters, its own or its enemyV but interference with a vessel in internal waters does not find its justification in the right of visit and search or any other maritimeright, whether the interference is by the territorial Power or its enemy. ,The Canal, however, was though internal waters, made subject to an international right of passage wider in some ways than the right of innocent passage through territorial waters and,therefore, it is perhaps natural to regard visit and search in the Canal as analogous to visit and search in territorial waters. Paragraph 753, page 556, of Higgins and Colombus (InternationalLaw of the Sea) says &quot; the right of visit and search may be exercised on the high seas and in theterritorial waters of the belligerents, but not in neutral territorial waters. There are also certain parts of the sea which by international agreement have been placed upon the same footing asneutral territorial waters, such as three miles from the entrance to the Suez Canal and, as betweenGreat Britain and the United States, a similar extent of the sea from the entrance to the PanamaCanal.&quot;
treaty of 29th October, 1888, and that they agree to their being put intoforce. The free passage of the canal being thus guaranteed, the executionof the last sentence of paragraph 1 as well as of paragraph 2 of Article viii of that treaty will remain in obeyance.&quot;(s)14. This agreement was published and none of the parties to the 1888Convention dissented from it. Germany, Italy and Austria expressly accepted thearrangements as applicable to themselves, while Russia had agreed in advancegenerally to the arrangements for Egypt then made. There can be no doubt thatin law all parties may be regarded as having accepted the terms on which theBritish reservation was at last withdrawn and the Convention went into force,the provisions for annual meetings of the representatives in Egypt of the Powersremaining in obeyance. ,15. Although it refers only to two small provisions of Article VIII the effectof the Anglo-French agreement so accepted by the parties to the Convention hasbeen that all the provisions of the Convention for collective action by the powers have fallen into disuse, and none of the other provisions for collective action has ever been invoked. Those other provisions were for the representatives of thePowers in Egypt to meet and call the Egyptian Governments attention to any danger to the free use of the canal (Article VIII), for Turkey in case of needwhen called on to help Egypt ensure the execution of the Convention to concert with the Powers (Article IX), and for notification by Turkey to the Powers wheneither Egypt or Turkey found it necessary to take advantage of the exceptions inArticle X for the defence of Egypt or the maintenance of public order. an explanation of this tacit abandonment of certain provisions of the convention was given by the French Government in the circumstances indicated in thefollowing paragraph.16. In 1938 the French Government sought an assurance from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment (which was given) that the Anglo-Italian Declaration of 16th Aprilof that year reaffirming their intention always to respect and abide by the provi-sions of the Convention of 1888 was intended merely to confirm that Italy was inthe same position as was France under the Anglo-French Agreement of 1904 andthat the only object was to record the undertaking of the British and italian governments to continue to act in accordance with the rules in force, namely, thoseof 1888 combined with those of 1904. (See Annex III of the Printed paper atthe end of this Memorandum.)17. The interesting feature of the French inquiry was the exposition form- j4098/38/16.ing part of it, of the thesis (i) that the British reservation of 1887 invalidated thewhole of the 1888 Convention; (ii) that this reservation was withdrawn only by theAnglo-French Declaration of 1904; and (iii) that the continuing reservation as to article VIII of the Convention tacitly rendered inoperative all the provisions ofthe 1888 Convention which were incompatible with the preponderating position ofGreat Britain in Egypt recognised in the Anglo-French Declaration that is not-only the remainder of Article VIII but also the references to the Powers in articles IX and X. The French memorandum pointed out that the safeguardsagreed upon in 1888 were thus profoundly altered; that for the original machinerywdrich associated the Powers with the supervision of the enforcement of the treaty and imposed on Egypt the obligation to protect the Canal by its own means and,in the case of their insufficiency, with the help of Turkey, was substituted a system under which the guarantee of freedom of passage ceased to be collective and was assumed exclusively by England; and that the Powers Signatories of the 1885Declaration had accepted the Anglo-French Declaration of 1904. The memo-randum went on to observe that subsequent international arrangements had merelyconsolidated and regularised (so far as need be) the Canal regime. The treaties of Versailles, St. Germain and Lausanne had established this regime againstGermany, Austria and Turkey, while the two first-named treaties had also recog-nised the devolution on England of the rights of Turkey as laid down in the 1888Convention.   The 1936 Treaty of Alliance between the United Kingdom and -  -Egypt introduced no new element, seeing that by Article 8 England remainedassociated with the protection of the Canal, and consequently the United kingdom had no need to seek the approval of the 1885 Powers to that treaty. (On theUnited Kingdom&apos;s succession to Turkish rights see paragraphs 8 to 17 of the printed paper at the end of this Memorandum.)  ,(2) These still reserved provisions relate to annual meetings of the Agents in Egypt of the signatory Powers.39017c 2
18. In the view of the Foreign Office (not communicated to the FrenchGovernment, or to any other Party to the 1888 Convention) the French expositionwas substantially correct and British conduct had been in conformity with it. Inthe opinion of Sir Eric (then Mr.) Beckett the French Government^ memorandum was correct in stating that the real meaning of the 1904 reservation to renderobsolete all provisions with regard to collective action by the Convention Powers;that there had since 1904 never been any question of the representatives in Egyptof the Convention Powers meeting in accordance with the parts of Article VIIIwhich were not expressly suspended in 1904, or of His Majesty&apos;s Government (asthe successor of the Turkish Government) giving notice under Article IX to the1885 Powers or concerting with them measures for the execution of the Treatyincluding the defence of the Canal, or under Article X of notifying those Powersof exceptional measures needed for the defence of Egypt. Were the legal positionnot as described in the French memorandum, it would have been doubtful whether his Majesty&apos;s Government could have concluded Article 8 of the Treaty of alliance with Egypt and its Annex without at least giving notice to those powers. (3)19. The French exposition of the position finds its basis in the fact that thegeneral undertaking in the French declaration of 1904 was expressly or tacitlyaccepted by the other Parties to the Convention as applicable to themselves, namely,that they would not obstruct the action of Great Britain in Egypt by asking thata limit of time be fixed for the British occupation or in any other manner.20. To conclude this brief historical review of the 1888 Convention, it isonly necessary to note how as a result of the 1919 Peace Treaties and the Treatyof Lausanne of 24th July, 1923(4) the United Kingdom now enjoys the powers conferred on Turkey by the Convention, which means, among other things, that since the Treaty of Lausanne came into force on 6th August, 1924, it is to theUnited Kingdom (not Turkey) that Egypt must appeal for aid in ensuring theexecution of the 1888 Convention including the defence of the Canal, and it isthe United Kingdom (not Turkey) which enjoys the dispensation under Articles IXand X of the Convention from the earlier Articles when taking measures for thedefence of the Canal or of Egypt.(5) The process by which the United Kingdomsucceeded to Turkish rights is described in the Printed paper at the end of thisMemorandum and especially paragraphs 8 to 17 (inclusive).D. Legal Considerations regarding the Right of Visit in the Canal1. The use of the Canal is subject to the navigation regulations of the suez canal Company. It is subject to Egyptian police and sanitary regulations.&quot; The free use of the Canal &quot; is not, therefore, to be construed as allowing ships to do as they please, but is subject to certain qualifications.2. The records of the International Commission of 1885 at Paris and itsSub-Commission (see Section C, paragraphs 6 and 7) and other preparatorydocuments may, therefore, be examined to ascertain the meaning of the Conven-tion. The records of the Sub-Commission were recognised by the Commissionto be a complete and reliable commentary. There is no reason to suppose thatthe records of the full Commission are less authoritative, (For the sake of convenience the numbering of the Articles in the final Convention is used in whatfollows.)Protocol No. 2, 3.   Early in the meetings of the Sub-Commission it was agreed to add to thepp. 6-7. ruie jn the last paragraph of Article I that the Canal should never be subjected to the exercise of the right of blockade, the words &quot; nor any other right of war &quot;for the express purpose of prohibiting the exercise in the Canal of the right ofvisit. All the delegates agreed that these words &quot;formally prohibited&quot; theexercise of the right of visit.(*) In a letter of 22nd September, 1949, to the British Charge d&apos;Affaires at Cairo, the EgyptianPrime Minister said that the provisions of Article VIII for a kind of collective control had never been in the slightest degree applied and had long since fallen into disuse.C) i.e., ithe provisions referred to by the French note of 1938 see paragraph 17 above andfootnote.     - ,(-&quot;&apos;) The Egyptian Government does not accept the United Kingdom claim to have succeededto the position of Turkey under the Suez Canal Convention. The legal grounds on which shecontests this claim have not been developed by her. She asserts that Egypt succeeded to Turkey&apos;position as territorial Power. The United Kingdom on the other hand maintains that in effect(though not in so many words) Egypt accepted this situation by Article 8 of the Treaty of Allianceof 1936.e12030/1531;31.
4.. The Sub-Commission&apos;s draft of what was to be Article IV, prohibited&quot; any act of war and any act having for its object the direct preparation of an operation of war.&quot; The draft Convention already included articles like ArticlesIX and X, dispensing the territorial Power from observing this prohibition whenengaged in the enforcement of the Convention and the defence of Egypt, and anarticle like Article XI to the effect that measures taken under Articles IX and Xshould not interfere with &quot; the free use of the Canal.&quot;5.   At the second meeting of the full Commission the British delegate pro- Protocol No 2posed to transfer the last paragraph of Article I to Article IV so that it should p-6-be subject to the exceptions in Articles IX and X.   This was objected to asallowing exceptions to the rule against blockade, which must be absolute. .   -..6.   The British delegate then proposed to omit from Article I the words ibid.&quot;nor any other right of War,&quot; Article IV being sufficient.   This was not accepted, but on his suggestion the words &quot; which might obstruct the free use ofthe Canal &quot; were added.7.   At this stage the last paragraph of Article I read : &quot; The Canal shall never be subjected to the exercise of the right of p. 7.blockade, nor of any other right of war which might obstruct the free use ofthe Canal,&quot;while in the draft of Article IV the Parties agreed &quot; that no act of hostility or other act having for its object the direct pre-paration of an operation of war should be committed in the Canal.&quot;8. In the discussion of the draft of Article IV the British delegate reverted Protocol No. 2,to the question, already considered, of the right of visit. He did not think the p&apos;words &quot; acts of war or act of hostility &quot; covered the right of visit and as it was desired to prohibit it expressly he suggested using the words &quot; no right of war &quot;which had a larger meaning. Instead of substituting these words for those inthe draft, it was agreed to add them to the others, so that the draft of Article IVthen contained an agreement between the Parties :&quot; that no right of war, no act of hostility or other act, &amp;c, should be com-mitted in the Canal.&quot;9.   At this stage, therefore, the words &quot; no right of war,&quot; expressly adopted Protocol No. 3,to cover and prohibit the right of visit, occurred both in Article I, which was pp&apos;l3&quot;16&apos;subject to no exceptions, and in Article IV which was subject to exceptionsunder Articles IX and X for the enforcement of the Convention and the defenceof Egypt.10. Before this particular matter was again referred to in the Commission,the British delegate argued strongly against the words in Article X &quot; by theirown forces &quot; which would prohibit an ally of the territorial Rulers from benefitingfrom the exception granted in that Article from earlier Articles when measures were being taken for the defence of Egypt. Part of his argument was that thewords of Article XI &quot; shall not interfere with the free use of the Canal &quot; would prevent measures taken by an ally as much as measures taken by Egypt and turkey from interfering with that use. This disarming argument, which could have implied a very extensive meaning for the words &quot; the free use of the Canal,&quot;was not accepted by the other delegates, who took the view that Article X was intended to reserve the benefit of the exceptions exclusively to Turkey and Egypt,and therefore refused, with the support of the Turkish delegate, to omit the words&apos;&apos; by their own forces.&apos;&apos; Consequently, this discussion (though it foreshadoweda difference which was to delay the signature of the convention for three years(vide paragraphs 7 and 8 of section C above)), did not clarify the nature of themeasures which could be taken under Article X but only who could take them.11. A slight change was then adopted in Article XI to accord with the draftof the last paragraph of Article I, a fact which clearly links &apos;&apos; the free use of the canal&quot; (saved in Article XI) with &quot;the free use &quot; stated as a principle inArticle I, with the prohibition there of the exercise of blockade and (as thedraft of Article I then stood) any other right of war which might obstruct itsfree use. .&apos;&apos;-&apos; ;,;:.12.   At the sixth meeting of the full Commission&apos;the German and Russian j;V&apos; ....delegates thought it desirable in view of the absolute terms of Article I as to the *;Canal being free and open, at all times, to make quite clear by the addition of aspecial Article that Egyptian sanitary measures might be applied.   This addition
was not regarded as necessary by most of the other delegates. some thought noquestion as to Egypt&apos;s right could arise (an attitude which clearly implied that&quot; the free use of the Canal &quot; was open to restrictive interpretation), while othersthought it enough to record in the Proceedings their understanding that egypt would have this right. Eventually Article XV was adopted, subject to the Britishreserve that its inclusion implied no new obligation. On the one hand, therefore,the adoption of Article XV emphasised the absolute character of the provisionsof Article I, and on the other hand, it was not to be regarded as increasing theburden or restrictions of any other part of the Convention. The Austrian dele-gate^ statement to the latter effect was not disputed by anyone.13. The full Commission then proceeded to the second reading of the draftConvention. It adopted Article I except for the words &quot; nor any other right ofwar &quot; in the last paragraph.   The Proceedings read : &apos;&apos; These words, recognised as serving no purpose as a result of the new draftof Article 5 [TV], are struck out.&quot;p. 8. 14.   At this stage a second paragraph was added to Article XII, reserving the rights of Turkey in that context as territorial Power and in Article XIII therights as well as the immunities of Egypt were saved, while it was recorded as theunderstanding of all the delegates that under Article X Egypt was entitled to act(within its powers) without special authority from Turkey. .15. From this summary of the work of the 1885 Commission it is legitimateto draw the following conclusions as to the meaning of the draft Convention : (a) The provisions of Article I were intended to be absolute and to admit ofno exception. The Canal was to be &quot; always free and open.&quot; TheParties undertook not to interefere in any way with &quot; the free use ofthe Canal.&quot;   It should never be subjected to blockade.(b) The exercise of the right of visit in the canal was forbidden by Article IV,but(c) under Article X Turkey and Egypt, but no other Power,(6) might exercise the right of visit in the canal, provided that(d) (under the terms of Article XI) &quot; the free use of the canal &quot; was notthereby interfered with.16. It follows that either the exercise of the right of visit in the Canal is absolutely prohibited as being inherently an interference with the free use ofthe Canal and the exception provided by Article X permitting derogations from(inter alia) all the provisions of Article IV by Egypt and Turkey does not operateso as to permit these powers to exercise the &quot; right of war &quot; of visit and search,or alternatively, the right may be exercised in the Canal and is not in the circum-stances contemplated by Article X an interference with the free use of the Canal.In the former case this prohibition, like that of blockade, could have been putin Article I. Indeed it was originally put in Article I, but was transferred fromthat article to Article IV. That the negotiators fully appreciated the effect ofwhat they were doing cannot be doubted. They refused to transfer the prohibitionof blockade from Article I to Article IV because that would have taken awayits absolute character, and would have subjected it to exceptions in the circum-stances contemplated by Articles IX and X. They did, however, transfer theprohibition of the exercise of any right of war (which covers visit and search)from Article I to Article IV and so subjected it to those exceptions. In thecircumstances it certainly seems probable that they did mean those exceptions to have some effect on the prohibition of the exercise of the right of visit and searchor (which is the same thing) that they considered the right of visit could beexercised without violating the free use of the Canal to which Article XI makeseven the exceptional rights of Egypt and Turkey under Articles IX and Xsubordinate.17.   The question then arises whether the right of visit is exercisable indifferent ways, some of which are permitted as not interfering with the free useof the Canal, and some of which are prohibited by Article XI as constitutinginterference with that free use.18.   Oppenheim says : &quot; The right of visitation is the right of belligerents to visit and, if need be, search neutral merchantmen for the purpose of ascertaining whether theseProtocol No. 3,p. 7.Oppenheim&quot; InternationalLajw,&quot;Vol.n(6th Ed.),Sec. 414.(6) Cf. paragraph 9 (6) and (7) of Section C above.
Iff) 4(4 1vessels really belong to the merchant marine of neutrals, and, if this is foundto be the case, whether they are attempting to break blockade, or are carryingcontraband, or rendering unneutral service to the enemy ....&quot; The right of visit and search may be exercised by all warships andmilitary aircraft of belligerents. But since it is a belligerent right, it may,of course, only be exercised after the outbreak, and before the end of war.... Since an armistice does not bring war to an end, and since the exerciseof the right of visitation is not an act of warfare, it may be exercised duringthe time of a partial or general armistice. The region where the right maybe exercised is the maritime territorial belt of either belligerent, and the open sea, but not the maritime territorial belt of neutrals.&quot;. . . . if the inspection of the papers shows that the vessel is carrying sec. 420.contraband or rendering unneutral service, or that she is for some other reason liable to capture, she is at once seized.  But it may be that, althoughostensibly everything is in order, there is nevertheless grave suspicion of fraudagainst the vessel.  In such case she may be searched.&quot;. . . . if search has brought the presence of contraband or any other Sec. 421.cause for capture to light, the vessel is seized ....  She may be seized and brought into a port for the purpose of being searched there as thoroughlyas possible.&quot; If a neutral merchantman resists visit or search, she is at once captured Sec. 422.and may be confiscated ....&quot; Neutral merchantmen are captured for the purpose of confiscating Sec&apos; 420.vessel or cargo, or both, as punishment for certain special acts, the punish-rnent being pronounced by a Prize Court after a thorough investigation intoall the circumstances of the case .... As regards passengers, if any, theyhave to be released as soon as possible, with the exception of those enemypersons who may be made prisoners of war . . . .&quot;19. From the passages above cited, it appears that Oppenheim agrees withthe view adopted by the 1885 Commission that the right of visit is not an act of war but a right of war. It also appears that the right of visit has an inseparableconnexion with the purpose of serves, namely, the publishment of neutrals forunneutral service (which includes the carriage of contraband to the enemy) bythe capture and condemnation of ships or cargo. There is nothing in the Pro-ceedings of the 1885 Commission to suggest that it contemplated the possibilityof severing the exercise of the right of visit (which is only a means to an end)from the exercise of the right to confiscate contraband (which is the end in view)and the reason of&apos;the thing is against such a severance. It is reasonable to con-clude that, if the right of visit is permitted, the further rights served by it arealso permitted, and that, if visit under Article X is not an infringement of theConvention, neither is seizure and confiscation of contraband thereby found and captured.20. To assist further in the elucidation of the question whether the dero-gations in Articles IX and X in favour of the territorial power from (inter alia)the prohibitions of Article IV, relating to the exercise of rights of war in the canal, do permit the territorial power to visit and search vessels in the Canal,it may be desirable to consider the effect of the exceptions in Articles IX and Xfrom the other restrictions applicable generally in normal times under ArticlesIV, V, VII and VIII.21. Provided that they did not interfere with the free use of the Canal,Turkey and Egypt, might under Articles IX and X, for the purpose of enforcing the convention or defending Egypt, do any of the things otherwise forbiddenby Articles IV-VIII viz. : A.   Notwithstanding Article IV (1) exercise rights of war;(2) commit acts of hostility;(3) commit acts having for their object to obstruct the free navigation ofthe Canal;(4) supply their warships, even when belligerent, without limit;(5) allow their warships, even when belligerent, to take any time they choosein transit;(6) allow their warships, even when belligerent, to remain at Port Said andSuez as long as they choose;
(7) allow their warships, even when belligerent, to sail from these ports ^without a twentjr-four hours or any delay after the departure of anenemy ship.B\ notwithstanding Article V even when belligerent;(8) disembark and embark troops, munitions and materials of war ad libitum \C. notwithstanding Article VII even when belligerent;(9) maintain warships in the Canal and the lakes and station any number at port Said and Suez;D. notwithstanding Article VIII;(10) erect works on either bank of the Canal, and(11) refrain from dispersing assemblages on either bank.22. What might thus be permissible to Turkey and Egypt was, of course,subject (Article XI) to the requirement that no Turkish or Egyptian measuresmust interfere with the free use of the Canal. The French Government in 1888characterised what was thus permitted as &quot; the military use of the Canal.&quot; TheBritish Government shared that view of the exceptions provided by Articles IXand X and agreed with the French Governments statement that &quot; The military use of the Canal for the defence of Egypt was accorded to theEgyptian Government by the terms of the Convention for the obvious reason that the Canal is in Egyptian territory, on the preservation of which itsneutrality depends.&quot;This statement was made in resisting Turkey&apos;s demands for similar exceptionsfor the defence of her possessions on the east coast of the Red Sea, a demandwhich was, however, finally granted by the addition of the third paragraph to article X.23. It is unnecessary to illustrate by examples what the territorial power is expressly authorised to do under Articles IX and X. The derogations fromArticles IV, V, VII and VIII speak for themselves. These derogations areindeed subject to the provision of Article XI that the measures so taken shallnot interfere with &quot; the free use of the Canal,&quot; but it is impossible to conceiveof effective use being made for the defence of Egypt of most of the derogationsaccorded without some interference with the use of the Canal: Supposing, forinstance, that Egypt is threatened with invasion or is being invaded such a literalconstruction of Article XI would mean that, however much the continuingunrestricted free use of the Canal might obstruct the measures of force authorisedto be taken in the Canal for the defence of the Canal or the defence of Egypt, thefree use must have precedence, even if, as a result, the enemy of Egypt thus obtainsa chance to block or blow up the Canal by sending through vessels equipped forthis purpose or a chance to invade Egypt by sending up the Canal vessels loaded with troops who disembark on the Canal banks. In a word, such a literal con-struction of Article XI defeats its main object, the preservation of free use ofthe Canal, and also the objects of Articles IX and X which undoubtedly are toenable the territorial Power to take all necessary measures of self-defence. .24. Such a literal (and perhaps absurd) construction of Article XI was not adopted in the wars of 1914-18 or 1939-45. During these wars (in the formerof which the invasion of Egypt was attempted from the east across the Canal by turkey) the Canal was closed for shorter or longer periods. Fighting took placein and across the Canal, and in general whatever was necessary to preserve thefree use of the Canal for the future and to preserve Egypt&apos;s independence and territorial integrity was done, though these things involved interfering with thefree use of the Canal temporarily.25. The main purpose of the negotiations between 1883 and 1888 was tofind a way of regulating the behaviour of warships in and near the Canal so thatits free use might be enjoyed by all ships at all times, without depriving theterritorial Power of the right of self-defence. The idea of neutralising Egyptas a whole was mootedJbut at no time was it seriously pursued by the Powers.Subject, therefore, to the elementary right of the territorial Power to defend its territory (which would exist even if it were neutralised) the object was to obviateas far as possible any risk to the free use of the Canal consequent upon the admission to it at all times of the warships of all countries.&apos;
26. Thus it was that the principal preoccupation of the negotiators was toregulate in and near the Canalthe behaviour of warships from which, beinginstruments of attack, the danger of interference with the free use of the Canaleither by attack on other ships using it or by attack on the Canal itself would arise.27. This preoccupation is disclosed not only by the course of the discussions in the Commission at Paris in 1885 and the subsequent discussions but by theform and substance of the Convention finally concluded.28. The burden of the first seven Articles of the Convention is the restrictionsplaced upon the presence or activity of warships in or near the Canal.29. In Article I the general agreement not to interfere with the free useof the Canal in time of war as in time of peace is in one respect particularised bythe express declaration that the Canal shall never be subjected to &quot; the exercise ofthe right of blockade,&quot; a right inherently exercisable only from the sea andessentially by warships against a port which is in the occupation of an enemy.There is no derogation from Article 1 in favour of the territorial State, but aState cannot &quot; exercise a right of blockade,&quot; against a port or area of its ownterritory and of which it is in possession. True, a State may close its port andmay defend its closure order by ships or land batteries, but it is not therebyexercising a right of blockade and there seems no reason to doubt that the powers in 1888 when using legal terms of art relating to warfare at sea meant these terms to be construed according to their proper legal meaning. That this is so is further illustrated by the fact that blockade is not mentioned in Article XIwhich applies only to the territorial Power. If the territorial Power (or thePower in occupation of Egypt) is really prohibited from closing the canal, it isnot the words in Article I about blockade which produce this effect but the words in Article I and XI about the free use of the Canal.30. An examination, however, of what the prohibition of the blockade doesand does not mean throws some light on what the Powers meant when they agreed that there should be no interference with free use of the Canal. Blockademeans preventing access to and agress from the blockaded place. In the caseof a Canal joining seas, and beyond them oceans, the exercise against vessels ontheir way to the Canal on these seas and oceans, that is on the high seas, of theordinary belligerent rights to capture enemy vessels, or to search, seize and perhaps condemn neutral vessels, would have the effect of denying to ships socaptured the use of the Canal. This is not blockading the Canal, although to theships seized it has the same effect. Yet obviously it was not the intention of theParties to the 1888 Convention to limit their exercise of belligerent rights onthe high seas in this general way either by agreeing not to blockade the suez canal by agreeing or that there should be no interference with free use of the Canal.This was the view of the Law Officers given on 28th March, 1887. Blockade is used in Article I in its technical sense, and the intention of the parties musthave been to forego the right which otherwise a belligerent enemy of Turkey (orof the United Kingdom then in occupation of Egypt) would have had, of prevent-ing ingress and egress of vessels of all nations and whatever they were carryingto and from that part of Turkish territory (or territory occupied by the UnitedKingdom), because it was in Turkish (or United Kingdom) occupation. since there is nothing to prevent enemy ships being captured outside the Canal limits and all neutral ships being diverted when outside those limits for search forcontraband, the treaty prohibition of blockade amounts only to an undertaking that ships attempting to enter or quit the Canal limits shall not be capturedand condemned for that reason alone. The undertaking not to blockade the Canaldoes not prevent any naval Power taking action outside the Canal which preventsmany vessels on their way there from using it. It may seize and capture enemy vessels about to enter the Canal area, and it may visit, search and capture neutral vessels carrying contraband, &amp;c. Further, it has never been suggested that suchaction is a contravention of the rule that there is to be no interference with thefree use of the Canal in peace or war.31. The prohibition of blockade on the one hand and the right to visit,search and seize vessels just outside the Canal area when they are about to enterit on the other hand have been considered here, not because these matters are involved in the matter now at issue between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theEgyptian Government, but because they throw light on the problem of construction which occurs in connexion with the exercise of the right of visit, &amp;c, inside the39017 D
Canal, the question which is in issue between the two Governments. The under-taking in Article I, not in any way to interfere with the free use of the Canal,in no way restricts the exercise by belligerents of their rights outside the 3-mile limit measured from the ports of access to the Canal. But if visit, search andseizure just outside the Canal of vessels about to enter it does not violate the duty(Article I) not to interfere with free use of the Canal, why should such visit,search and seizure in the Canal violate this provision of Article I, or violateArticle XI, which merely repeats this portion of Article I. It is true that visit and search inside the Canal does violate Article IV, but there is in Articles IXand X a derogation in favour of the territorial power from Article IV.32. The conclusion reached at the end of the preceding paragraph is notconsistent with the view apparently taken by the Law Officers of the meaning of the convention when it was still in draft but not signed. When the Law Officersgave their opinion on 28th March, 1887, that the proposed Convention did not interfere with a belligerents freedom of action outside the three-mile limit, they also expressed the view that &quot; Turkey abandons her territorial rights so far asthose rights might be exercised to close the Canal, or to engage in hostile operations against vessels using it.&quot; It is right to point out, however, that at that date,the third paragraph had not been added to Article X, a paragraph which was understood to give Turkey the military use of the Canal (see paragraph 22 above).Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government and Egypt have in fact, without objection,in two world wars closed the Canal. What is now in question is not even closingthe Canal; nor is it even engaging in hostile operations against vessels using it.It is merely the exercise of the right of visit and search which is at most a rightof war and not an act of war, and one the exercise of which does not deny to shipping in general the use of the Canal.The Gutenfelsl.r. (1916)2 A.C. 112.WhittuckInternationalCanals (1918)..166.E. Practice regarding Visit and Search in the Canal in the War of 1914-181. At all times since the Canal was opened to traffic in 1896, the canal company has applied its regulations regarding the payment of dues, the use of pilots and tugs, the formation of convoys and other matters connected with the efficient use of the Canal as a highway for sea-going ships and its operation as acommercial undertaking.2. Equally at all times has the Egyptian Government enjoyed and exercisedthe right of police, particularly with regard to the control of traffic in narcotics,and the right of sanitary control, even over warships.3. In the war of 1914-18 the Canal was closed to traffic for a short time bythe British and Egyptian authorities; enemy ships in it were escorted out of it and captured, British troops and supplies were landed freely in its ports of access; andBritish warships were stationed along it.4. Although the Central Powers did not declare war on Egypt, war waswaged against her by Turkey, and as a territory in British military occupationEgypt could certainly be regarded as an enemy by them, and British Prize Courtsheld for the purposes of The Hague Convention No. VI of 1907 that Port Saidwas an &apos;&apos; enemy&apos; port &apos;&apos; vis-a-vis Germany. In that war, therefore, Egypt was toall intents and purposes at war with the Central Powers and military operations were carried on in and across the Canal in the defence of the Canal and at thesame time the defence of Egypt.5. The Officer Commanding the British Forces protecting the Canal issuedan order that no enemy vessel should enter it. However, an enemy ship (theConcadoro) in one of the Canal ports at the outbreak of war was granted pei-mission to go through the Canal, but refused to take advantage of it. The BritishGovernment informed other Governments that since the outbreak of war certainships of enemy countries had remained in the canal, some being detained by theEgyptian Government for hostile acts committed in the Canal or apprehended,and others because they refused to leave although given a free pass, thus showingan intention to use the ports of the Canal as ports of refuge, which was not contemplated by the Convention and could obviously incommode&apos;and even block theUse of the Canal and its ports by other&apos;ships; and that the British government considered the Egyptian Government justified in removing from the Canal allenemy ships which had been long enough there to show that they had no intentionof departing in the ordinary way. These ships were taken out beyond the 3-mile limit, where they were seized by the British Navy and subsequently condemned asprize. &apos;Some of these ships had used their wireless in the Canal to report to german warships the movements of British vessels and the Egyptian Government
19 g^acting under Article IX of the Convention detained them and removed their wire-less to prevent what was regarded as an act of hostility.6. As for enemy ships outside the limits of the Canal, the British command.of the seas prevented their making use of the Canal. The Convention was not regarded as restricting the exercise of belligerent rights on the high seas, exceptthat it prohibits the exercise of the right of blockade, and consequently the capture of enemy vessels and neutral vessels outside the limits of the Canal was not an infringement of the Convention provided that they were not captured merely&apos;because they entered the Canal. From the treatment accorded enemy ships foundin the Canal at the outbreak of War it would appear that any enemy (or neutral)ships managing to get within the Canal limits would have been allowed, subjectto their observance of the Convention, to enjoy the right to free passage, for what that would have been worth but they would have been captured 3 milesoutside it.7. The British navy avoided (ostensibly at any rate) during the 1914-18 warexercising the right of visit and search for the purposes of contraband withinthe limits of the-canal, but in 1915, Sir Edward Grey approved the searching o vessels within the Canal to ascertain that they were not engaged in any enterpriselikely to affect the free navigation of the Canal owing to the inconvenience ofsearching vessels outside the three-mile limit. His view was that the exerciseof any right of war within the three-mile limit was technically a violation of theConvention, but that as a primary object of the Convention was the protectionof the Canal itself, search for the protection of the Canal by Great Britain on whomthe duty of protecting the Canal had devolved would be in conformity with itsspirit. (He might have said that search to see that a vessel is not going to damage the Canal is not a right of war. though search for contraband is, and that search for the former purpose would be permissible in case of suspicion in time of peace,and that indeed it has no relation to war or the rules of war.) He doubted, how-ever, whether examination of cargo would also be justified, since the carriage of contraband had only an indirect connexion with the protection of the Canalbut thought that if this were done with reasonable discretion no objection to,itor to the communication of the results to naval or other authorities outside the canal area was in practice likely to be raised. (It was for this purpose that theAdmiralty had asked permission to search within the limits of the Canal.)Nevertheless, he directed that no guilty or suspected vessel should be capturedor detained within the three-mile limit unless there was clear proof that the vessel was actually engaged on an enterprise likely to obstruct the free navigationof the Canal. In practice, it is understood that information derived from thesearches conducted within the three-mile limit for the purpose of ascertaining wether the vessel was likely to be a danger to the Canal was used by the british navy in capturing vessels outside the three-mile limit for contraband. Theinstructions sent by the Admiralty (with Foreign Office concurrence) to the 71764 of senior Naval Officer^ Egypt, on 27th May, 1915, included the following :- f 1Aunc&apos;1915&quot; Third. Vessels passing the Canal in either direction may be examined 371/2356)-and if necessary searched in neutralised waters with the ostensible objectof safeguarding the Canal. If such search reveals the presence of goods liableto detention the vessel should be allowed to proceed and arrangements madeto detain her when she emerged from the neutralised waters. If bound westshe should be sent to Alexandria and if bound east she should be ordered tocall at Aden. In both cases if the character or quantity of goods liable todischarge is unimportant, guarantees may be accepted that the goods willbe discharged at a British or Allied port.&quot;&quot;Fourth. All prize courts wherever established abroad have equalpowers and the eourt at Alexandria is therefore competent to deal with neutral ships.&quot;8. It is noteworthy that although war had broken out between certain ofthe parties to the 1888 Convention and the Canal became within the area ofhostilities and was attacked by Turkey, His Majesty&apos;s Government did not avail themselves of the view expressed, by Lord Salisbury in 1887 and accepted by theFrench Government (Section C. paragraph 9 (1) above) but continued to actgenerally within the provisions of the Convention instead of avowedly treating itas no longer valid.39017 d 2
; . 9. It is not easy in retrospect to decide in what character His Majesty&apos;sjiGovernment took the various kinds of action above described. In the.characterof a mere party to the 1888 Convention His Majesty&apos;s Government could not havejustified many of the measures taken, except on the ground that the Convention hadbeen violated by another Party, e.g., Turkey, and that therefore all other Partiesincluding the United Kingdom were released from any obligation under it (see section C, paragraph 9 (1)). But many of these measures were taken beforeTurkey attacked the Canal and there is no evidence of any other Party havingviolated the Convention before those measures were taken. Moreover, Sir EdwardGrey&apos;s view shows that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not regard the convention as having come to an end. Consequently it was not on the basis that the Conven-tion was no longer binding,- that His Majesty&apos;s Government took the measures in question.10. True, on 18th December, 1914, His Majesty&apos;s Government declared aProtectorate over Egypt and so terminated Turkish authority in that country, but many of the measures in question were taken before that date, and even beforethe war with Turkey broke-out on 5th November, 1914, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could not, therefore, rely at that time upon any claim to have succeeded to turkey&apos;s rights, under Articles IX and X.11. The only remaining character in which His Majesty&apos;s Government could have justified the measures taken, was that of military occupant of Egypt,enjoying the rights of Egypt to take meaures in self-defence and in defence ofthat Canal. The French view of the effect of the Anglo-French Declaration of1904 and its acceptance by all other Parties to the 1888 Convention was that theUnited Kingdom supplanted all the other Great Powers for the purposes of theConvention, they having agreed not to obstruct the action of Great Britain inEgypt in any manner (Section C, paragraphs 17-19 above). In other words, inthe 1914-18 war, as far as the rest of the world was concerned the United kingdom was to all intents and purposes, Egypt, and His Majesty&apos;s Governments measures were justifiable under the 1888 Convention, if they were so justifiable, as measureswhich Egypt was entitled to take in her own defence and the defence of the canalunder Articles IX and X.12. If then the major measures taken, namely, conducting military opera-tions in the Canal (notwithstanding Article IV), disembarking troops, munitions and supplies in the Canal (notwithstanding Article V) and stationing vessels ofwar in the Canal (notwithstanding Article VII), and even closing the Canaltemporarily, could, be regarded as authorised to Egypt (and so to the UnitedKingdom), it is strange that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have consideredthe exercise of visit and search in the Canal with a view of controlling contrabandas something not authorised by the Convention. In retrospect it is difficult tounderstand why this view should have been taken. The measures actually takenwere to some extent directly referable to the defence of the Canal itself, while others were referable more generally to the defence of Egypt, is., measures whichfind their justification in Articles IX and X. For the latter, contraband control was as essential as it was for the defence of Britain, but it appears that sir edward Grey considered it only in the context of the defence of the Canal andnot that of the defence of Egypt. The only explanation that suggests itself for not actually seizing contraband in the Canal itself and its ports of access isthat this was not considered necessary, in view of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentscontrol of the seas, either for the defence of the Canal or for the defence ofEgypt. Nevertheless, even if it was not &quot; necessary &quot; it would have been extremelyconvenient, and the fact, so difficult to explain, remains that the right of actuallyseizing contraband was not exercised in the Canal in the 1914-18 war. (It istrue that under a search ostensibly conducted for another purpose (i.e., protectionof the Canal) information was naturally obtained at the same time which enabled the British authorities to know what ships they might profitably seize outsidethe Canal for contraband). It is natural to conclude, therefore, that in the first world war the United Kingdom considered itself entitled to exercise the exceptional rights provided in Articles IX and X for the territorial Powers only,but did not consider, or at any rate thought it doubtful, that visit and search inthe Canal for contraband was allowed under these articles, in the circumstancesof that war, including the consideration that Egypt was not formally a belligerent.In brief, the conclusion reached on this point in Section D above differs from theview apparently entertained for whatever reason in 1914-18.
F. Practice regarding Visit and Search in the Canal in the War of 19391. In the War of 1939, once more the Canal was for a short time closed to&apos;traffic, booms for its defence were placed at its entrances and it was freely usedfor military purposes for its own defence and that of Egypt, but restrictions on traffic did not significantly differ from those imposed in the 1914-18 war.2. On 28th August, 1939, the Egyptian Government declared a state ofemergency and by Decree-Law of the same day established a system of inspection of ships in the port of Alexandria itself. Oh 2nd September a state of siege wasproclaimed and on 3rd September a Military Proclamation established a systemof inspection at Port Said and Suez but at these two ports the inspectionanchorages were outside the limit of three marine miles from them. regulations made the same month required ships to declare their cargoes, closed Port said and Suez from sunset to sunrise, imposed restrictions on the use by ships of theirwireless, and imposed a blackout. Alexandria, Port Said and Suez were all tobe closed in time of fog. Alexandria might be closed at any other time by militaryorder, whereas Port Said and Suez were to be closed at other times only if thesecurity of the Canal required it.3. So far as the Canal Company&apos;s information goes, no goods were seizedon board any ships within the Canal limits, and the only complaints received bythe Company were with regard to the precautions taken during the transit of shipssuspected of intending to block or damage the Canal.4. Nevertheless from September 1939 to June 1942, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment maintained at Port Said a &apos;&apos; Contraband Control Base &apos;&apos; and made use ofinformation obtained by visits in the Canal for contraband control outside thethree-mile limit.5. The following statement of British practice was made by a former mem-ber of the British Contraband Control Service in Egypt and communicated to theForeign Office by the Military Branch of the Admiralty on 7th July, 1948 : &quot; While the Contraband Control Base at Port Said was functioning,i.e., from the outbreak of war until June 1942, contraband or suspect cargowas often landed voluntarily at Port Said in order that the ship could proceeddirect to her destination and not have to submit to diversion to Haifa. Ifthe offloaded cargo was subsequently ordered to be seized in Prize it hadto be trans-shipped to a British port for seizure. Passengers were not dis-embarked. Enemy subjects were guarded in their cabins and the shipintercepted outside the three-mile limit. It is emphasised that any cargolanded was landed voluntarily.&quot;Between December 1939 and April 1940 the British Governmentordered that voluntary landings could not take place lest the egyptian government should be associated with our Contraband Control Service. this order was cancelled by His Majesty&apos;s Government in April 1940 after strong pressure had been brought to bear by the Egyptian Government and theMinistry of Economic Warfare. The Neutrals, themselves, were desirous of continuing the practice in order to avoid diversion to Haifa, therebyincurring delay and port expenses.&quot;6. The net effect in the War of 1939 as in the War of 1914 was that by theuse of British naval forces outside the Canal limits, often helped by information obtained within those limits, effective control of contraband passing throughthe Canal was achieved. In due course the world-wide supervision by british authorities of the loading of all ships obviated the need for elaborate measuresof control near the Canal.7. Between the wars of 1914 and 1939 His Majesty&apos;s Government had succeeded legally to Turkish rights under the 1888 Convention (Section C, para-graph 20 above), and in the latter War were (as they had also been in 1914r-18)entitled to the benefit of the, exceptions provided in Articles IX and X of theConvention, although for a different reason. In the second world war the UnitedKingdom was not in occupation of Egypt but had obtained by Treaty succession to Turkey&apos;s rights. That they did not seize contraband in the Canal in the1939 war would appear once more to indicate that they did not regard theConvention as authorising that measure, and it is that view of the convention which has been stated to the Egyptian Government in His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfsprotests against Egyptian action during the Palestine conflict.
G - The Palestine ConflictTo form an opinion as to whether or not the Egyptian contraband control inthe Suez: Canal is or is not lawful in the circumstances of the Palestine conflict,1 itis necessary to consider- . 1(a) what Egypt has done;(b) the character in which she has claimed a right to do it;(c) whether the conflict is a war or not, particularly having regard to theaction taken by the United Nations during the conflict; and(d) whether, if the conflict is not a war, the Egyptian measures are, neyer-theless, wholly or in part justifiable. !2. As to (a), the Egyptian Government proclaimed a state of siege onloth May, 1948, in accordance with a new law permitting this to be done &quot;to ensure the security of the Egyptian Armies, to guarantee their supplies,to protect their lines of communication and other things concerning theirmovements and their military operations outside Egypt.&quot;On the same day the Egyptian forces entered Palestine on what the egyptian government declared to be a police operation to restore law and order there, begunon the invitation of the Palestine Arabs and directed against Zionist terroristhands.3. By Proclamation of 15th May the system of inspection of 1939 applying to Alexandria was reapplied to that port, and it was provided that all ships should undergo examination before entering any of the three ports Alexandria,Port Said and Suez in accordance with regulations to be made, thus leavingimprecise the system intended to be applied in the Canal ports. Nevertheless the proclamation provided that a system of inspection of ships in all three ports wasthereby set up.4. On&apos; 18th May a Proclamation authorised the Customs authorities toexamine the cargo manifests of all ships in those ports in order to make sure theydid not include munitions or goods of any kind destined directly or indirectlyfor anyone in Palestine. If goods so destined were found they were to be dealtwith in accordance with the rules of public international law and in appropriate cases confiscated after the making of an inventory.5. On 6th June similar treatment was provided for goods exported from palestine whatever their origin or destination.6. On, 28th June the application of Proclamation No. 13 was elaborated bythe notification of what would be considered contraband of war and so confiscable.Provision was also made for requisition of goods not confiscable against paymentof compensation and for the refusal of supplies to ships suspected of helpingin any way the Zionist forces in Palestine. Aircraft were assimilated to ships for the purposes of the Notice.7.: The inspection of ships was in fact carried out in the ports of access ofthe Canal in spite of the indication in Proclamation No. 5 that it should be done before ships entered them. Even so, this phraseology did not require the inspec-tion to be .outside the 3-mile limit. Moreover, the 1939 precaution of closingPort Said and Suez by night was not taken. It appears, therefore, that theEgyptian Government made no effort to observe the practice of 1914 and 1939.&apos;of inspecting; ships outside the 3-mile limit, except in case of alleged suspicion -of danger&apos; to the Canal when they were searched within that limit. What theEgyptian authorities in fact did was to carry out a customs inspection in the ports of Port Said and Suez and then seize cargoes for eventual adjudication or possibly requisition.8. By Proclamation No. 38 of 8th July, 1948, a Prize Court (Prize Council)was established to adjudicate in accordance with the rules of international law-captures made under Proclamation No. 13 and the Notices of 6th and 28th Junewhether in Egyptian ports, the territorial waters of Egypt or Palestine, or on.the high seas. It was provided that ships belonging,to the Zionists of palestine should be confiscated without submission to the Prize Council. The Council has given a number of decisions condemning cargoes and in one case at least a ship.9. His Majesty&apos;s Government have contested the legality of the institution of the Prize Council, but have not dissuaded British&apos;subjects from endeavouringto get their property released by it.
10. On 29th June, 1949, having regard to the armistice, the. egyptian government modified its instructions regarding the inspection of ships and the seizure of contraband of war in Egyptian ports as follows : I.   Customs inspection alone suffices and military inspection is dispensed with.II. &apos; Contraband of war was redefined as follows :-(a) Arms of all kinds, ammunition, explosives, chemical products and appli-ances suitable for use in chemical warfare; equipment for the manu-facture and repair of the above and spare parts; materials used intheir manufacture.(b) Combustibles of all kinds, means of transport by land, sea or air, andequipment for their manufacture and spare parts and instruments,articles and draft animals for using them; materials used in theirmanufacture.(c) All means of communication, instruments, equipment, maps, machinesor documents appropriate for the conduct of enemy military opera-tions and materials for their manufacture or use.(d) Coin, gold and silver bars, money and instruments of credit and alsometals, materials, &amp;o, necessary or appropriate for their manufacture.III. Two or more grounds for presuming enemy destination, instead of only. one, would be required.IV. Unless a consignor was on the black list, a presumption of hostiledestination would not be raised by the consignment of goods to order of theconsignor or of the shipping company.V. Calling at a Palestinian port on a previous voyage would not in itselfexpose a ship to the refusal of supplies or of the right to load in Egyptian ports.VI. Formalities of inspection and seizure must be curtailed as much aspossible so as to reduce to a minimum the delay caused to shipping.11. As to (6), that is, the character in which Egypt has claimed the right todo what she has done, Egypt- at-first denied but soon assumed the character of abelligerent.12. In reply to His Majesty&apos;s Governments protests against the inter-ference with ships in transit through the Canal, and denying the evidence of astate of war, the Egyptian Government already on 24th June, 1948, claimed that Note No. 252the rapid development of extensive hostilities in Palestine and the proclamation of ^789/1530/an Israeli Government de facto and the precipitate recognition by other countries of the pretended State of Israel, had created a situation very like war in inter-national law, and that it was not possible to deny to the parties to the conflictthe character of belligerents in the strict legal sense of the word, notwithstanding the non-recognition of Israel by the Governments of the Arab States. Having hadto send Egyptian forces into Palestine to fight the Zionist forces which were well-trained and well-armed and, moreover, in occupation of a substantial part ofPalestine with numerous towns, villages and ports, the Egyptian Governmentcould not avoid exercising belligerent rights within the limits necessary to protectits troops, to ensure the success of their operations, and to prevent suppliesreaching the enemy. For this last purpose it justified the visit and search of shipsentering the Egyptian ports which was conducted under the Proclamation of15th and 18th May. Moreover, it claimed that the measures taken caused far lessinconvenience to shipping than visit and search outside the three-mile limit andthat these measures constituted the minimum interference with shipping con-sistent with Egypt&apos;s defence.13. It is clear, therefore, that as from some unspecified date before 24thJune, 1948, the Egyptian Government claimed to be entitled to act as a&quot;belligerent&quot; and it was on the basis of this claim that it claimed to beentitled to visit and search ships for contraband at Port Said and Suez.14. His Majesty&apos;s Government consistently refused to recognise thecharacter of belligerent so claimed by Egypt and&apos;on 10th September, 1948, the ambassador at Cairo in a Note (No. 399), while admitting that the scale of opera- \ 6050/i53oytions had changed since 15th May, expressly denied that the Egyptian Govern- &apos;6-ment had acquired the rights of a belligerent or that the safety of Egypt wasthreatened. That Note reiterated His Majesty&apos;s Governments traditional view; that, even though search of ships in the Canal to see that they did,not carrymaterial which might damage the Canal might be justified in the circumstances,seizure in the Canal of contraband so discovered was an infringement of the
&quot;24 EGYPT1888 Convention, and it denied that the British Government had ever seizedcontraband in the Canai, repeating (what was true) that seizure was made in both world wars only, outside the three-mile limit. At the same time, the Notedenied the Egyptian Governments claim to have succeeded as territorial Powerto all Turkish rights to ensure the execution of the Convention, and reiteratedHis Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs claim to have succeeded to those rights.15. On 22nd November, 1948, the Ambassador formally notified the egyptian government that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not admit that the nature of the hostilities in Palestine entitled the Egyptian Government to exercise the rights ofPrize.16.   The positions of the two Governments have therefore been clearly defined from an early stage of the Palestine conflict, Egypt claiming to be abelligerent, and His Majesty&apos;s Government consistently denying her that character.etio51/iig. 17.   As to (c), whether the conflict is a war or not, Sir Eric Beckett in his letter of 20th February, 1950, to the Attorney-General on the position under theAnglo-Jordan Treaty of Alliance of 15th March, 1948, has pointed out that the armed conflict in Palestine could only be said not to be a war on the technicalground that one of the contestants, Israel, had not achieved the recognised positionof a State (paragraph 9) and he concluded that up to the time of the armisticesconcluded in August 1949, it was doubtful whether there was in law a state of war(paragraph 11), although any attack by either side since the conclusion of thearmistices would create a state of war (paragraph 12). The question raised bySir Eric Beckett concerns a future situation in case Israel attacks Jordan, and thequestion of war or no war in the past has become academic in the context ofthe Anglo-Jordan treaty. In the case of Egypt the question of war or no war inthe past, as now, remains important to be determined, but the papers (andespecially Paper C) already submitted to the Attorney-General in connexion withthe Jordan Treaty of Alliance provide, it is thought, a sufficient account of theUnited Nations action during the conflict to enable a conclusion to be reached as.to whether or not from an early stage of the conflict Egypt&apos;s claim to exercisebelligerent rights is legally justified.18. There is, however, one aspect of United Nations action which mayusefully be examined more closely in the present context, and that is the arms embargo.19. On 29th May, 1948, the Security Council by its Resolution No. 7 called for a four weeks&apos; cease-fire in Palestine and an embargo during that period onthe introduction of fighting personnel and. war material into Palestine, Egypt,Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Trans-Jordan and Yemen, and decided thatif the Resolution were rejected by either party, or if, having been accepted, itwere subsequently repudiated or violated, the situation in Palestine would bere considered with a view to action under Chapter VII of the Charter. The respecting-lution was accepted by the parties to the Palestine conflict and the cease-fire andembargo became effective on 11th June, 1948, and remained in force until 9th July,1948, when hostilities began again.20. On 15th July, 1948, the Jews being ready to prolong the truce and theArabs being unwilling to do so, the Security Council by its Resolution No. 9,decided that the situation in Palestine constituted a threat to the peace withinthe meaning of Article 39 of the Charter, and ordered the Governments and authorities concerned pursuant to Article 40 of the Charter to desist within three days from further military action failing which the Council would consider further action under Chapter VII on the basis of the existence of a breach ofthe peace within the meaning of Article 39. The resolution also called upon all governments and authorities concerned to conform with the resolution of29th May, 1948. The cease-fire and embargo so ordered became effective on18th July, 1948.21. On 11th August, 1949, the Security Council held that the armisticeagreements between the parties to the conflict superseded its resolutions of29th May and 15th July, 1948. The arms embargo was thus&quot; considered to havebeen liftsd. The Council reaffirmed its order of 15th July, 1948, for the partiesto continue to observe an unconditional cease-fire pending the final peace settlement.22. It follows, that from 11th June, 1948, to 11th August, 1949, with9 days&apos; gap in July 1948, there was in force an order by the Security Councilprohibiting &quot; all Governments and authorities concerned to introduce fightingpersonnel or war material into the countries named.
23. Article 103 of the Charter provides that &quot; in the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the presentCharter and their obligations under any other international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail.&quot;24. It follows that if Egypfs obligations under the Suez Canal convention of 1888 conflict with her obligations under the Security Council&apos;s arms embargo, the latter prevail. The only Party to the 1888 Convention which isin a position to complain of this result of Article 103 of the Charter is Spain,which is not a member of the United Nations and can regard the Charter asres inter alios acta, but no Spanish complaint could be made effective against theUnited Nations. Apart from Germany and Austria, all other Parties to thatConvention are Members of the United Nations and are precluded from com-plaining if action prohibited by the 1888 Convention is taken under the Charter.Germany and Austria, in view of their present special situation, can be left outof account.25. There is no evidence that the Security Council considered the peculiarposition of Egypt in relation to the Suez Canal and of the Canal itself, when it-imposed the arms embargo. The resolution of 29th May, 1948, calling upon&apos;&apos; all Governments and authorities concerned &apos;&apos; not to introduce military personnelor import or export war material into or to the countries named, that is thosedirectly involved in the Palestine conflict might obviously be supposed to bedirected primarily to all Governments and authorities other than those of thecountries named, but it is perfectly clear from the terms of the resolution that&quot; all &quot; meant all Governments and authorities including those of the parties to the conflict. The resolution calls upon &quot; all Governments and authorities concerned &quot;to order a cessation of all acts of armed force, meaning the parties to the conflict.It then calls upon &quot;all Governments and authorities concerned&quot; not to&quot; introduce &quot; fighting personnel into the countries involved in the conflict, meaninghere the authorities of all Members of the United Nations and those of the partiesinvolved in the conflict. It then calls on &quot;all Governments and authorities concerned &quot; not to mobilize or submit to military training men of military again fact introduced into their territories, meaning here the authorities of theparties involved in the conflict. It then calls on &apos;&apos; all Governments and authorities concerned &quot; to refrain from &quot; importing &quot; or exporting Avar material into or tothe countries involved in the conflict, meaning thereby to bind both the authorities of those countries and the authorities of all other countries, not to take part inthe introduction of war material into the countries directly involved. The resolu-tion, after making other provisions, ends by calling on &quot;all Governments &quot; to take all possible steps to assist in the implementation of the resolution.26. The question is whether Egypt was entitled, or obliged, by this resolution to stop military personnel and war material going to Palestine through the suez canal.27. The Suez Canal Convention has always been applied as if it assuredcustoms franchise to goods passing through the Canal (except for narcotics), and goods so passing through have never, it is thought, been regarded as having beeneither imported into, or exported from, Egypt. At first sight, therefore, it wouldseem that for Egypt to permit the passage of war material through the Canal to palestine would not be an infringement of the obligation not to exportsuch material to Palestine or of the obligation not to import such material into Egypt. But the last paragraph of the resolution required &apos;&apos; all governments,&quot; including the Egyptian Government to take all possible steps to implement the resolution. Now any war material passing through the Canal to palestine was necessarily exported by someone from somewhere and was beingimported by someone in Palestine. The resolution prohibited both that export and that import and the Egyptian Government has certainly shown that amongthe possible steps to prevent that export and import was the interception of suchwar material in the Canal, for it has in fact intercepted it. The question is wasEgypt authorised or bound by the resolution so to do. It seems doubtful if shewas especially as by intercepting it she (another party to the conflict) acquiredit for herself.28. At this stage of the examination of this unreal-seeming situation(unreal-seeming because it is inconceivable in the ordinary case that one country would permit or could be bound to permit the passage across its territory of warmaterial for its enemy), the question arises, whether in seizing such war materialEgypt was herself importing it contrary to the resolution and so illegally.   Here39017 e
the legal absurdity of the situation becomes acute. If there had been a duty to intercept, there would be a conflict between that and a duty not to import. to achieve the purpose of the resolution as a whole the war material so seized byEgypt would have to be sterilised in Egyptian hands the moment it came to them.To observe the terms of the resolution and at the same time to keep her hands cleanEgypt might either have delivered such war material to the Mediator to be heldby his observers, or have deposited it in the Free Zone at Port Said, or elsewhere,disclaiming any intention of using it. There is no doubt, however, that theEgyptian Government intended to appropriate and use as it saw fit any &quot; con-traband of war &apos;&apos; it seized in the Canal. Whether there has been occasion duringthe hostilities, e.g., in July 1918, to use war material so seized is not known, butit is quite clear that that material has been &quot; imported.&quot;29. Egypt has not in fact ever relied on these resolutions of 29th May and15th July, 1948, to justify her action. It is possible that if further challengedshe might try to do so. Finally, for the interception in the Suez Canal of cargoesother than war material during the period of the embargo, and of cargoes of allkinds before the embargo came into force on 11th June, 1948, and after it ceased to be in force on 11th August, 1949, at any rate, Egypt must seek justificationelsewhere than in the resolutions imposing that embargo. Much of what has beenseized by the Egyptian Government could not reasonably be regarded as &apos;&apos; warmaterial &apos;&apos; even if under modern practice it could be declared by a belligerent to becontraband of war.(:)30. As to (d), that is, whether, if the Palestine conflict is not a warauthorising the exercise of belligerent rights by the parties to it, the Egyptiancontraband control measures in the Canal are nevertheless wholly or in part justi-fiable, the question whether the United Nations arms embargo resolutions couldbe invoked by Egypt has been considered in the previous paragraphs.31. Another approach to the question is to consider what a Government maylawfully do in self-defence even if it is not at war. Under international lawthe existence of a state of wiar is neither a necessary condition nor a necessaryconsequence of a State&apos;s taking measures of force in its own defence, even whenthose measures have effect outside its boundaries and in the territory of another state, and neither the League Covenant, nor the United Nations Charter hasdenied the right of self-defence. Measures that are necessary for self-defencemay be taken.32. The peculiarity of the so-called &quot;belligerent rights&quot; being exercised by Egypt is that except for what was done in Palestine, all these rights wereexercised in Egyptian territory. No case is recorded of the Egyptian authoritieshaving exercised belligerent rights on the high seas or even in Egyptian territorial waters either by naval or by air forces, but Egypt did exercise contraband control in the Canal and the Canal though Egyptian may be said to have been put in theposition of Egyptian territorial waters. It is probably going too far to say thatthe Canal was made neutral territorial waters even if Egypt was belligerent.There was a threat of action from the air against ships in Palestinian waters, andpossibly that action was in fact taken, but that was not on the high seas. On theother hand, ships which chose to put into the Port of Alexandria entered egytian territory and whatever was done to them and their cargoes was done undermunicipal law in Egyptian territory. Being justified by the Egyptian Govern-ment as required by the state of emergency in which Egypt found herself, inspeaking of belligerent rights. Whether there is war or not, considerable rightsof interference with the property of foreigners in, or coming into, a country are(7) Note. The Security Council at no time defined &quot; war material&quot; for the purposes of the embargo. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government did, however, defineit for their own purposes and eventually in agreement with each other and in consultation with theMediator. The basis of the definition was Group 17 of the Export of Goods (Control) (Amendment)(No. 3) Order, 1948, to which was added spare parts for the items there listed and warships. from it were excepted webbing equipment, civil aircraft and spares for replacements for existing airlines,and jeeps and civilian lorries, and communications equipment. The list so adopted included among other things, arms and ammunition of all kinds and apparatus exclusively designed for warfare,and the means of making all the above ; tanks, armoured cars and armoured transport vehicles and component parts thereof ; and noxious gases.   It did not include petroleum.The Egyptian definition of Contraband of War, even as limited on 29th June, 1949, includedmany items not covered by the Anglo-American definition, e.g., aircraft of all kinds, and coin andbullion, and petroleum.In the absence of an authoritative definition of war material by the Security Council, there would clearly be room for much argument as to what the Egyptian Government is entitled to regard as war material within the meaning of the arms embargo.
recognised by international law in a state of emergency. Thus requisitioning of,goods required for the country&apos;s security or defence on payment of compensationmight in these circumstances be justified.33. But Alexandria is not on the Canal and Egypt has exercised contraband control in the Canal. Assuming that the answer to the first question is in the affirmative (namely that if Egypt was at war she could by virtue of Articles IXand X so act in the Canal) the question is whether she can do this in the Canalif she is not at war but involved in an emergency which can be argued with some justification to present a danger to the safety of Egypt. It is to be noted thatif in the Canal Egypt must find her justification for this action in Articles IXand X in granting derogations in favour of the territorial power do not confinethese derogations to time of war. Assuming the answer to Question I to be that egypt can. when she is at war exercise contraband control in the Canal and assuming that Egypt cannot claim the rights of a belligerent in the Palestineconflict, Egypt&apos;s difficulties in justifying her action spring as much from general international law as from the Convention. The Convention assimilates the Canal(although really a Egyptian internal waterway) to Egyptian territorial waters(see footnote to paragraph 12-Section C above) and Egypt has herself so farrecognised the maritime character of the Canal and characterised the nature ofher actions as those of a maritime belligerent that she directed search and seizurefor contraband and set up a Prize Court. But if she is not at war, she has no right to search or seize for contraband at all by general international law. Thequestion therefore is whether an International Court would hold Egypt bound by the characterisation which she had herself given to the action in question, andnot permit her to depart from that and to justify the action on the alternativeground that the stopping in the Canal of war material going to Israel was simplya &quot;measure for the defence of Egypt,&quot; covered by Article X and not limitedto time of war and was not the exercise of a right of war at all.Paper No. 2M.0150/50Mr. A bercrombie to Sir W. StrangA dmiralty,Sir, 15th April, 1950.I have laid before My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty Sir EricBeckett&apos;s semi-official letter of 13th March to Mr. Dodds, with which was encloseda draft submission to the Law Officers of the Crown and a memorandum on theexercise of belligerent rights in the Suez Canal.2. My Lords consider that from the naval point of view it is in the interestof the United Kingdom that no power should be allowed to exercise belligerentrights in the Suez Canal. They do not doubt that, from the point of view ofthe Ministry of Transport also, it would be preferable that all powers should be prohibited from exercising belligenent rights in the Canal. My Lords consider,therefore, that the Law Officers should be informed that this interpretation ofthe Convention of 1888 would best suit British policy, and be asked whether theConvention can properly be interpreted in such a way as to uphold that policy.The memorandum and submission to the Law Officers, as drafted, make no mention of the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government and appear to discount all arguments which could be used to support the attitude hitherto taken up by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.3. My Lords have of course been impressed by the result of Mr. McDougall&apos;sresearches into the proceedings of the conference of 1885 and in particular by paragraph 16 of Section D of the memorandum. Nevertheless they feel that thereis some danger in trying to read too much into researches of this kind. Howevercomplete the records may be, there can be no certainty at this date of what was inthe minds of those who discussed and negotiated the Convention- On the otherhand there is no doubt that, however exact may be the interpretation of the pro-ceedings of the conference as set out in the memorandum, it leads to a conclusionwhich is frankly ridiculous.4. It is argued in the memorandum that Articles IX and X allow egypt and the Ottoman Empire, when acting in enforcement of the Convention or in thedefence of Egypt, to do any of the things normally prohibited by Article IV,
provided (Article XI) that they do not interfere with the free use of the Canal.Article IV, however, normally prohibits &quot; any act having for its object to obstruct,the free navigation of the Canal.&quot; If Article XI means.anything, it is impossiblefor Articles IX and X to allow such actions and yet to preserve the free use ofthe Canal. Therefore at least one of the prohibitions contained in Article IV isabsolute, and there may be others.5. In their semi-official letter of 25th January under this reference, theAdmiralty argued that Articles IX and X allowed only such of the things normallyprohibited by Article IV as could be effected without interfering with the freeuse of the Canal. My Lords admit that it is not easy to reconcile this interpreta-tion with the wording of the two articles. Nevertheless, in view of the absurdityreferred to in the preceding paragraph, My Lords cannot help wondering stillif this is not the true interpretation.6. Such an interpretation is consistent with the attitude adopted by HisMajesty&apos;s Government towards the Convention in both the World Wars. ThusHis Majesty&apos;s Government had no hesitation in conducting military operations inthe Canal (notwithstanding Article IV); disembarking troops, munitions and supplies in the Canal (notwithstanding Article V); and stationing vessels of warin the Canal (notwithstanding Article VII); actions which do not physicallyinterfere with the passage of the Canal. At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment went to considerable lengths to avoid exercising the right of visit and searchin the Canal which was clearly interpreted as interference with the free usethereof. It is true that in the First World War His Majesty&apos;s Government alsoclosed the Canal altogether for a period, but at this stage My Lords believe thatthe Turks were actually on Egyptian soil and that there was even fighting inthe Canal itself. It would appear, therefore, that those concerned found them-selves in an operational predicament in which self-preservation demanded the breaking of the conventional law. The period during which the Canal was closedduring the Second World War was very short and the reason, for reopening itmay well have been the realisation that the closure was unjustified unless an armed invasion were actually taking place.7. I am to request that the arguments set out above may be incorporated inthe memorandum for the Law Officers or at least that the Law Officers be informed of Their Lordships&apos; views.8.   In conclusion My Lords desire me to express their regret that they shouldhave been given so short a time in which to study this complicated question.; 9.   A copy of this letter is being sent to the Ministry of Transport.I am. &amp;c.NIGEL J. ABERCPiOMBIE.
128SECRETJE 1425/43EGYPTNo.[3rd August, 1950]Foreign Office to the Law Officers of the CrownForeign Office, S.W.1,Gentlemen, 11 th July, 1950.I have the honour by direction of Mr. Secretary Bevin to refer to my letter whether to you of 15th April last, and to your reply dated 11th May, concerning the belligerentaction of the Egyptian Government in exercising rights of visit and search in the rights, suchSuez Canal Zone and seizing material alleged to be going to Israel.   Certain searchandconsiderations have since emerged which were not fully covered by my previous seizure,letter and your reply, and on which I am now to seek your advice. continue2.   The Egyptian action falls into two periods: the first from the 15th May, period of61948, when the British mandate in Palestine terminated, until the 26th February, an1949, when, following on a previous truce, active hostilities between Egypt and Armistice:Israel finally ceased, and a formal Armistice was concluded; secondly, the period Egyptianwhich has elapsed since the conclusion of this Armistice and which is still in progress. theSuezYour previous opinion is fully applicable to the first of these two periods, but canalfurther consideration in the course of inter-departmental discussions here has Zone,suggested that different criteria may be applicable to the second or post-armisticeperiod.3. Leaving out of account any actions justifiable as an exercise of domesticEgyptian sovereign right over ships which by entering Egyptian ports becomesubject to Egyptian laws and regulations, and confining the case to action inthe Suez Canal Zone proper it seems clear that in order to justify exercisingbelligerent rights of visit and search in the Zone, Egypt must show both of fw0things:  (i) that the situation is one in which she is entitled to exercise belligerentrights in general;(ii) in particular, that she is entitled to exercise them within the Suez canal zone, notwithstanding the provisions of certain articles of the suez canal Convention such as Articles I, IV and XI: in effect this means that Egypt must show that the exercise of belligerent rights within the suez Canal Zone is, according to Article X of the Convention &quot; necessary. . . for securing . . . the defence of Egypt and the maintenance ofpublic order.&quot; (It should be noticed in regard to the second of these requirements that the action must apparently be necessary not oniyfor the defence of Egypt but also for the maintenance of public order.The French text (which is the original) is not quite so clear as it contains a comma before the &quot; and,&quot; referring to the measures whichEgypt may take &quot; pour assurer ... la defense de 1&apos;Egypte, et lemaintien de 1&apos;ordre public.&quot; If both are in fact required, then, unless it can be said that something necessary for the defence of Egypt isautomatically and ipso facto also necessary for the maintenance ofpublic order, it would seem that unless something is in fact necessaryfor the latter purpose it would, strictly, not be justified merely on theground of being necessary for the former.)Is Egypt still entitled to exercise Belligerent Rightsl4. The right to exercise belligerent rights in general depends, in this caseat any rate, on the existence of a state of war, and in the final paragraph of youropinion under reference you expressed the view that Egypt could claim &quot; that16318   39174 b
the circumstances existing during the Palestine dispute and at the present timeconstitute a war for the purpose of entitling Egypt to exercise rights of war withinthe meaning of Article X.&quot; It is, of course, also recognised that a state of war,once existing, does not come to an end merely by reason of the conclusion ofan armistice, which is only a suspension of active hostilities, and not the terminationof the state of war or the establishment of peace. On the other hand, maritimeseizures are themselves acts of war. Visit and search (clearly so when carriedout by naval action at sea) is essentially a military act. It is therefore a questionwhether a suspension of the right to take such measures is not implied in the suspension of active hostilities, unless the contrary is stated in the armistice pro-visions. On this point a conflict of authority exists. Maritime seizure is certainlya hostile act if directed against enemy shipping or cargoes. If, therefore, suspension of the seizure of enemy ships and cargoes is involved in the suspension of hostilitiesunder an armistice, a fortiori would a suspension of the right to seize neutralship or cargoes be involved, since the latter right is really ancillary to the former,and moreover it would be a quite unacceptable position if a belligerent possessedgreater rights in this respect against neutrals at any given time than he possessedagainst the other belligerent.5. Annex 1 hereto contains a review of such authority as can be found onthe matter, together with some comments. As will be seen, opinion is divided,and it does not seem possible to state with certainty which view would prevailbefore an international court. Both are arguable, but the better view, particularly if regard is had to the recent practice of States, seems to be that if maritimerights against merchant shipping are not reserved in an armistice, expressly orby implication, they are suspended. On this view, the exercise of belligerentrights against shipping at sea is to be regarded as constituting essentially an act of war of a military character; and this view is also supported by the moderntendency for armistices to amount to something more than a mere truce orsuspension of hostilities and constitute in effect preliminaries of peace. There is,thus, ground for thinking that Egypt might have difficulty in justifying the con-tinued exercise of the right of visit and search against shipping as a lawful exerciseof belligerent rights during the period following on the conclusion of the Egypt-Israeli armistice.6. The above view finds support in the provisions of the Egyptian-IsraeliArmistice, the text of which is attached (Annex 2)*. It was negotiated after several weeks of discussion between the parties at Rhodes, under United Nationschairmanship, and was the result of two United Nations Resolutions of November,1948, calling for it. Further, it replaced an already existing truce or cease-firebased on an agreement between the parties made in January, 1949.7. (a) If, as several of the authorities hold, the right to continue to stopcontraband, etc., has to be expressly reserved by an armistice, then this particularone contains no such reservation, and even contains provisions which might suggest the contrary.  For instance, Article I, paragraph 2, says that:  &quot; No aggressive action by the armed forces land, sea or air of either party shall be undertaken, planned or threatened against the people or the armed forces of the other.&quot;Similarly, Article II, paragraph 2, provides that:  &quot; No element of the land, sea or air, military or para-military forces of either Party including non-regular forces shall commit any war-like or hostileact against the military or para-military forces of the other party or againstcivilians in territory under the control of that Party.&quot;This suggests that the exercise of belligerent rights must be ruled out, at any rateif effected by naval action at sea, since such action would certainly be aggressiveand the reference to &quot; people &quot; and &quot; civilians &quot; would cover action against merchantshipping belonging to those concerned; while, as already noticed, if belligerentrights at sea do not exist against enemy merchant shipping they can scarcelyexist against neutral shipping; and in view of the general tenor of the suez canal Convention it would seem impossible to argue that Egypt could havea right to exercise against foreign shipping in the Suez Canal Zone rights which she would not be entitled to exercise at sea.* Not printed.
(b) Paragraph 4 of Article I of the Armistice reads as follows:  &quot; The establishment of an armistice between the armed forces of thetwo Parties is accepted as an indispensable step towards the liquidation of armed conflict and the restoration of peace in Palestine.&quot;!   This is a clear indication that the Armistice was not intended to be a mere!   temporary suspension of hostilities but to lead up to a definitive peace; that it1   was, in fact, a preliminary of peace.  On that basis the case for arguing that itI   brought about at least a suspension of the right to exercise belligerent rights against shipping is considerably strengthened.   The same conclusion emerges from the preamble and a later provision (Article XII, paragraph 2), both of which recitethat the Armistice Agreement was negotiated in pursuance of Resolutions of theSecurity Council which called for the establishment of an armistice &quot; in order to eliminate the threat to the peace in Palestine and to facilitate the transition fromthe present truce to permanent peace in Palestine.&quot;   Article XII, paragraph 2,i    then goes on to say that the Armistice is to &quot;remain in force until a peaceful settlement between the parties is achieved.&quot; There is therefore nothing temporaryabout the Armistice.   It was clearly intended to set up a permanent conditionof suspension of hostilities pending the conclusion of a formal peace. The reference in the foregoing passage to &quot; the present truce &quot; also indicates the true character1   of the Armistice, because previous to the conclusion of the Armistice an actualI   truce did already exist, based on an Egyptian-Israeli General Cease Fire Agree-I   ment, dated 24th January, 1949, and paragraph 5 of Article XII expressly states   that the Armistice supersedes that Agreement.   This assists the view that theI   Armistice was intended to do more than set up a temporary regime; for, indeed,8   it succeeded such a regime, and set up a different one intended to last until itshould be superseded by a final peace settlement.  The same view emerges from paragraph 3 of Article XII which says that the Parties, may (though only by mutual consent), revise the Armistice or any of its provisions, or may suspendI   its application at any time, except in relation to Articles I and II.  These ArticlesI    are, of course, the essential ones providing for the cessation of hostilities andof all military action. The Armistice cannot be unilaterally denounced and cannot,as regards its essential provisions, be terminated even by mutual agreement, unlessby a final peace settlement.Can Egypt justify measures of visit and search as necessary for securing the defenceof Egypt and the maintenance of public order?8. Even assuming that Egypt could claim still to be entitled to exercisebelligerent rights in general, and to visit and search shipping for contrabandgoing to Israel, she still has to justify the exercise of these rights in the Suez canal zone, and for that purpose to show that they are necessary for securing thedefence of Egypt and for the maintenance of public order. The conclusion of thearmistice, the suspension of hostilities and the circumstances generally have created a situation in which there is absolutely no active threat to Egyptian territory orindependence at all. The essence of the question is, therefore, whether the con-tinued existence of a bare technical state of war and the possibility for all practical purposes entirely theoretical that the armistice might be terminatedand hostilities resumed, justify Egypt in the continued and indefinite exerciseof the right of visit and search in the Canal Zone on the score of necessity forsecuring the defence of Egypt and the maintenance of public order. As will beseen from the passages from the Armistice Agreement already referred to, theArmistice cannot in fact lawfully be terminated (i.e., without a breach of the Agree-ment) except by the conclusion of formal peace.9. Actually, Egypt has modified her contraband list since the conclusionof her armistice with Israel, so that it now only covers &quot;arms and munitions strictosensu, strategic fuels such as oil, and specie. Her case would presumably bethat so long as peace has not been concluded, so long as the state of war exists,and the resumption of hostilities is possible, it is necessary for the defence ofEgypt to prevent Israel building up her supply position to a point where she could resume hostilities and once more bring into being an active threat to egyptian territory.10.   Such an argument would not come well from Egypt in the circumstances,since she has persistently refused to extend any recognition to the State of Israel,and consequently has placed herself in a position when she cannot conclude a39174     &apos; B 2
treaty of peace with Israel, or at any rate cannot do so without thereby extending &apos;recognition; and she has in fact made no move towards the conclusion of anytreaty, although the Armistice clearly contemplates and intends some such move.The whole Egyptian argument suggested above would in fact be contrary to the plain tenor and intention of the Armistice and would be very difficult to sustainin view of the terms of that instrument.11. Moreover, whatever theoretical case could be made out in favour ofthe Egyptian action during the present period as being necessary to the defenceof Egypt, it would seem almost impossible for her to show that it was also necessary for the maintenance of public order, as appears to be required by the strict letter of Article X. Threats to public order normally only arise under emergency conditions or when active hostilities are in progress. It is difficult tosee that in the present circumstances any special measures at all can be necessaryfor the maintenance of public order, still less that visit and search and seizure of contraband on board foreign ships could be necessary for that purpose. Evenif the Egyptian Government were to contend that public unrest and possiblyrioting might be caused by the free passage through the Canal of ships carryingwar material to Israel, the answer would seem to be that such unrest and riotingcould be controlled by ordinary police action and does not require the seizure of the cargoes concerned. This point was not brought to your express attentionwhen you were asked to give your original opinion, and it is possible it might affect that opinion, even as regards the pre-Armistice period, though on the otherhand it is somewhat in the nature of a technicality. But in regard to the post-Armistice period, it may well be permissible to take advantage of technicalities.12. This leads to the consideration that the provisions of Article X, and inparticular the criteria to be applied in determining whether certain measures arenecessary for securing the defence of Egypt and the maintenance of public order,must be considered in relation to the Convention as a whole. Taken as a whole,the Convention is very firmly directed towards securing free passage through the suez Canal Zone at all times, whether in peace or war, and to prohibiting theexercise in the Zone of any obstructive measures, including measures otherwiselawful in the exercise of belligerent rights. Article X creates an exception to this principle, but it would seem that, in the nature of the case, the exception mustbe construed strictly rather than widely, and that in order to justify, by reason ofit, measures which would otherwise be contrary to the Convention, Egypt mustbe in a position to make out a reasonable case of necessity for the purposesindicated, namely, the defence of Egypt and the maintenance of public order.It would seem that something much more than a vague potential or hypotheticalthreat is required, something more than the possibility that hostilities which have,a considerable time ago, been suspended, may be resumed (contrary to the expressprovisions of an Armistice which cannot be unilaterally denounced). If, indeed,despite the Armistice, there were active signs that the Israelis were preparing to resume hostilities, Egypt might be justified in reimposing a regime of visit and search in the Canal, but short of that, and in the absence of any actual orvisible threat, she would seem to be placing an unwarrantable interpretation on article X, and enlarging the exception thereby created to a point where it is really destructive of the main intention of the Convention.13. The absence of all active or even potential threat to Egypt is furtheremphasized by certain other provisions of the Armistice Agreement. Thus para-graph 3 of Article I states that:  &quot; The right of each party to its security and freedom from fear of attack by the-armed forces of the other, shall be fully respected.&quot;Article X, moreover, sets up a Mixed Armistice Commission to supervise theexecution of the Armistice with power to appoint observers, and other rights.Thus any Egyptian argument that their defence necessitates the stoppage of warmaterial going to Israel seems to be devoid of reality and based on a pure tech-nicality the continued existence of a formal state of war. Actually there isno real practical difference between the present situation so far as any threat to Egypt goes, and that which would result after the conclusion of peace, if itappeared that Israel might build up her war potential and then make war on egypt again. Yet in those circumstances Egypt could clearly not exercise belligerentrights at.all, however allegedly necessary to her defence it might be to stop warmaterial going through the Canal to Israel.

Memo, quoting, and commenting on, the views of legal authorities as to whether abelligerent is entitled to exercise the right of visit, search and capture at sea after the conclusionof an armistice (Annex 1).2. Egyptian-Israeli General Armistice Agreement, Rhodes, Greece. 24th February, 1949(E8105/1016/31).JE1425/47(SECRET)OpinionSir,We are honoured with your commands signified to us in Sir Eric Becketfsletter of 11th July, 1950, and we have reconsidered our previous Opinion in thelight of the terms, to which our attention has been directed, of the Armistice whichhas been concluded.We think it must be regarded as still unsettled in international law whetherbelligerent rights such as those of search and seizure continue during the periodof an Armistice. The authorities in the matter are conflicting and in our viewregard must be had to the express provisions on Armistice itself. On the whole,however, we think that the better opinion is that the rights of visitation, searchand seizure of contraband continue unless the terms of the Armistice otherwise39174 b 3^ 14. It is not suggested that the mere removal of an immediate threat to egypt would necessarily or always require abstention from measures otherwisejustifiable under. Article X. For instance, in the late war it would have been difficult t6 argue that the mere fact that the Axis powers were driven from north Africa in 1943 removed the threat to Egypt, or the necessity for takingcertain measures in the defence of Egypt, given the fact that hostilities with Ger-many and Japan were still in progress, that Axis forces were still in Italy, greece and Crete and capable of carrying out both sea and air activities against Egypt.It is obviously a question of circumstances and degree, and the question is whether in the present circumstances the visit and search of ships in the Canal and theremoval of cargoes destined for Israel is a measure necessary for securing thedefence of Egypt and the maintenance of public order. ^Having regard tothe situation and the nature of the Armistice it would be dimcult for Egypt tojustify the fears she might allege; and her action might well look to a Court to benot a bona fide exercise of war rights, but an attempt to create difficulties for Israelby economic measures. There would thus seem to be a considerable chance thatan international court would hold that Egypt was not justified in the circum-stances in indefinitely continuing these measures, particularly when she maintainsan uncompromising opposition to adopting the usual course of following up theconclusion of an Armistice by the negotiation of a peace settlement, as the Armisticeplainly contemplates.15. It is accordingly requested that you will be so good as to consider thismatter and furnish Mr. Bevin with your opinion whether, and if so, to what extent, your previous opinion is applicable to the period subsequent to the con-clusion of the Egypt-Israeli Armistice, and whether, in the circumstances whichhave existed since that date and now exist, Egypt is still justified in exercisingrights of visit and search in the Suez Canal Zone.I have the honour to be,Gentlemen,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)   W. E. BECKETT.
Annex 1Whether a belligerent is entitled to exercise the right of visit, search and captureat sea after the conclusion of an Armistice.1. There is a division of opinion amongst the authorities on this point. Thosewho answer the question in the negative are as follows:  Wheaton, International Law (Dana&apos;s ed. 1866), p. 498, speaking of an armisticesays:  &quot; As the supreme power of the State is bound to fulfil its own engage-ments or those made by its authority, express or implied, the Governmentof the captor is bound, in the case of a suspension of hostilities by sea, to restore all prizes made in contravention of the armistice.&quot;provide. In fact of the conflict of opinion, we prefer the.view expressed; ih the ^6th Edition of Oppenheim on International Law, as follows:-r: L;&quot;Armistices or truces in the wider sense of the term arc all agreements between belligerent forces for a temporary cessation of, hostilities. Theyare in no wise to be compared with peace and ought not to be called temporarypeace because the condition of war remains between the belligerents them-selves and between the belligerents and neutrals on all points beyond the mere cessation of hostilities. In spite of such cessation the right of visit and search over neutral merchantmen therefore remain intact as does likewisethe right to capture neutral vessels attempting to break a blockade and theright to seize contraband of war.&quot;This view seems to us consistent with principle and with the reasons justifyingthe exercise of these belligerent rights. It is true that in the case of this ArmisticeArticle I, paragraph 2, and Article II, paragraph 2, contain prohibitions againstwarlike action and hostilities, but these are general prohibitions and are not aptin our view to exclude rights such as search and seizure.In these circumstances, it remains a question of fact and degree whetherthe measures actually being taken by Egypt at the present time are &quot;necessary... for securing . . . the defence of Egypt and the maintenance of public order.&quot;We do not think that much can be made of the fact that the measures takenmust be necessary &quot;for maintaining public order&quot; as well as for the defenceof Egypt, since as a general proposition neglect of defensive measures may imperil the maintenance of internal order. But we agree that the longer the Armisticecontinues in force and the less likely a resumption of hostilities becomes, themore difficult it must be to justify the necessity for the continued exercise of the belligerent rights by showing that a situation existed such as is contemplated in Article X. The terms of the Armistice in this case are intended to put anend permanently to hostilities and in fact, although not in law, a state of affairs which approximates to peace now appears to exist. The matter would be one for the International Court to decide but we think that Egypt will be increasingly-hard put to it to justify the exercise of measures which may have been very necessary whilst actual hostilities were continuing and during the period of un-certainty immediately following the Armistice. We think, therefore,. that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are justified in taking up a fairly firm line about the mattersince however equivocal the terms of the Convention itself may be, the circum-stances now are approximating more and more to normal peacetime conditionsin which reliance can no longer be placed on the provisions of Article X whateverinterpretation may be given to those provisions.We have the honour to be.Sir,Your obedient Servants,HARTLEY SHAWCROSS.FRANK SOSKICE.Royal Courts of Justice,London.3rd August, 1950.
Garner, Prize Law During the World War (1927), p. 204:  &quot; In the absence of treaty stipulations to the contrary captures made afterthe conclusion of peace are null and void. The right of capture may be andusually is suspended by the conclusion of an armistice. The armistice con-cluded on 11th November, 1918, provided for an immediate cessation ofhostilities at sea, but it expressly declared that the blockade of Germany shouldbe continued and that German merchant vessels encountered at sea remainliable to capture.&quot;Garner mentions in a footnote that the Italian Prize Regulations, 1917, provide that vessels captured after a suspension of hostilities should be released. (However,this was superseded by Article 200 of the Italian Laws of War see below.)Colombos, The Law of Prize (1940), p. 165:  &quot; An armistice implies the suspension of all military and naval operations,and consequently of all maritime seizures. This provision is expressly enacted in the majority of recent treaties, such as the Armistice Convention of 28thJanuary, 1871, between France and Germany, and of 30th March, 1895,between China and Japan, and that of 4th June, 1897, between Greece and turkey. The same rule was also adopted by the Institute of InternationalLaw. During the Great War, however, the belligerent parties, by expressagreement, stipulated that all enemy ships and cargoes met at sea would continue to be liable to capture (Article 5 of the Naval Conditions of theArmistice Convention with Austria-Hungary of 3rd November and Article 26of the Convention with Germany, of 11th November, 1918), and severalseizures were accordingly effected after the Armistice by the Allies and con-demned by their respective prize courts.&quot;The first part of this statement is confused and is elucidated below.Hall, International Law (1924), p. 662:  &quot; The legality of captures at sea during an Armistice depends on its terms. The Armistice between China and Japan of 30th March, 1895, andthat between Japan and Russia of 1st September, 1905, permitted maritimecaptures to continue. The Armistice of 11th November, 1918, between Ger-many and the Entente Powers provided for the continuance of the existingblockade conditions and both in the French and English prize courts vessels and cargoes captured during the Armistice were condemned.&quot;2. Although Hall does not expressly say so (or rather, Pearce Higgins. by whom this paragraph was written), he clearly thought that unless there was anexpress provision to the contrary, the belligerent rights of visit, search, &amp;c, weresuspended during an armistice. Colombos appears to take the same view, buthe states the effect of the 1871, 1895 and 1897 Armistices elliptically and almostmisleadingly. None of these Armistices are in the State Papers but they are described and their terms are cited in Coleman Phillipson&apos;s Termination of Warand Treaties of Peace. The Franco-German Armistice of 1871 contained nothingdirect except that (quoting Phillipson, p. 67) &quot; all captures made after the con-clusion of the Armistice and before its notification were to be restored,&quot; therebyimplying that the Armistice rendered further captures inadmissible, as a consequenceof the cessation of active hostilities. The Sino-Japanese Armistice of 1895 expresslyprovided (Phillipson, p. 69) that &quot; all contraband of war &quot; was to &quot; remain liableto capture according to the usual laws of war.&quot; By the Grasco-Turkish Armisticeof 1897, Turkey (p. 70) was &quot; forbidden to reinforce her armies by sea or transportcontraband of war.&quot; Both these Armistices therefore in effect expressly reserve the right to stop contraband and imply that but for this the right would have ceased on the conclusion of the Armistice. The same is true of the Russo-JapaneseArmistice of 1905, Article 3 of which (textually quoted by Phillipson, p. 71) saidthat &quot; maritime captures will not be suspended by the Armistice.&quot; Having regardto this and to the provisions of the 1918 Armistice, it would seem that accordingto the recent practice of States a provision either expressly or by implicationreserving contraband, &amp;c, rights must figure in an armistice, otherwise these rightsare suspended.
3. Colombos also fails to state accurately the view taken by the Institute ofInternational Law, which adopted a sort of middle course. In the Manual issuedby it at its Oxford session in 1913, the following provision appears in Article 92:  &quot; An Armistice suspends the operations of war. Blockades established at the time of the Armistice are not raised in the absence of a special stipulationto that effect of the Convention. The right of visit may continue to beexercised. The right of capture ceases, except in the cases where this rightwould exist as regards neutral vessels.&quot;It will be seen that this Article draws a distinction between the right of visit andthe right of capture. The position formulated by the Institute would appearto be that the right of visit continues after the armistice and so does the right ofcapture, as regards neutral vessels, but not as regards hostile vessels. This viewseems untenable (see Conclusions paragraph below).4. On the other hand, the following writers say that the belligerent rightcontinues in spite of the Armistice:  Wheaton, International Law (Keith&apos;s Ed.) (1944), Vol. II, p. 561:  &quot; The right of visitation can be exercised during an armistice and evenuntil the ratification of a treaty of peace, though both those rights are dis-approved by the Reglement of the Institute.&quot;Keith is here referring to an earlier ruling of the Institute, not that of 1913 butthe Reglement International des Prises Maritimes (1882). Article 5 of this Regle-ment states (translation) &quot; The right of prize as regards belligerents does not beginuntil the commencement of hostilities. It ceases during an armistice and withthe preliminaries of peace. As regards neutrals, the right of prize cannot beexercised unless and until the belligerents have notified them of the existence of astate of war&quot; (Annuaire, 1882-3, p. 213).Oppenheim, International Law (6th Ed.), Vol. II, p. 433:  &quot; Armistices or truces, in the wider sense of the term, are all agreements between belligerent forces for a temporary cessation of hostilities. They arein no wise to be compared with peace and ought not to be called temporarypeace because the condition of war remains between the belligerents them-selves and between the belligerents and neutrals on all points beyond the mere cessation of hostilities. In spite of such cessation the right of visit and search over neutral merchantmen therefore remains intact, as does likewisethe right to capture neutral vessels attempting to break a blockade and theright to seize contraband of war.&quot;Fauchille states in Vol. II of his treatise at p. 999 (translation):  &quot; Many consider that the exercise of the right of visit is not a hostileact but is merely preliminary to such an act. It has therefore been concluded that this right should not be regarded as suspended during an armistice, whetherpartial or general as such an armistice does not put an end to the war but merely brings about a cessation of hostilities. If the right of visit was suspended during such a period neutrals could profit by its suspension inorder to furnish with impunity contraband of war to the belligerents.&quot;Fauchille cites the Oxford Manual of the Institute and a decision of the FrenchPrize Court in 1926. However, he then goes on rather inconsistently to point outthat Article II of The Hague Convention on Neutral Rights and Duties in MaritimeWar, 1907, provides as follows:  &quot; Any act of hostility including capture and the exercise of the right ofsearch committed by belligerent warships in the territorial waters of a neutralpower constitutes a violation of neutrality and is strictly forbidden.&quot;He also points out that Article 5 of the earlier Reglement of the Institute ofInternational Law regarding maritime prize of 1882 (quoted above) providedthat the right of visit ceases with the preliminaries of peace. This is not quitethe same thing as an armistice. But the Egypt-Israeli Armistice is in fact verylike preliminaries of peace.

No English decision bears directly on the question but the Rannveig [1922]1 Appeal Cases p. 97, and the Bellaman [1948] 2 A.E:R. 680 have some interest.In the former, a cargo of salted herrings in transit from a port in Norway to Stettinin Germany was condemned as being conditional contraband bound for a Germanbase of supply. The seizure was made in March, 1919, after the armistice. Thecase, however, does not prove anything because, as pointed out above, the armisticeitself expressly provided that such captures should be lawful. In the Bellaman,two Italian merchant vessels were seized by the Crown after the Armistice with italy. It was admitted by the Crown that the right to capture Italian merchantvessels was precluded by the terms of the Armistice and for this reason thePresident said it was not necessary for him &quot; to examine such authority as is tobe found in textbooks on international law regarding the right to capture enemy merchant vessels during an armistice.&quot; The Crown&apos;s admission seems to havebeen an inference from the fact that the Armistice created an Italian shippingpool to be available (under Italian ownership) for Allied war use.6. As regards foreign cases, Rowson in his article on &quot; Prize Law during theSecond World War &quot; (British Year Book of International Law, 1947; p. 172), says that the matter has been discussed in the French and Italian courts in connexionwith both the Franco-Italian Armistice of 1940 and the Armistice between Italyand the United Nations of September, 1943. He cites The Santa Flavia decided by the French Conseil des Prises in 1946 (unreported). An Italian vessel wasseized in October, 1944, while attempting to transport some Italian civiliansfrom Tunisia to Pantellaria. The Court examined the terms of the Armisticebetween Italy and the United Nations of 1943 and found &quot; it did not permit thecontinuance against Italian vessels of the right of prize by the United Nations.&quot;Rowson says:  &quot; The law was stated to be that the right- of capture cannot be exercisedwhen hostilities at sea have ceased except where there is hostile assistance orattempted breach of blockade. The vessel was held not to be guilty of either of these offences and was therefore released/&apos;The Italian Prize Tribunal considered the effect of the Franco-Italian Armisticeof 1940. According to Article 200 of the Italian Laws of War exercise of theright of prize is to cease with the end of the war. The Tribunal established that&quot; end of the war &quot; is not the same as &quot; armistice.&quot; It examined the ArmisticeAgreement and concluded that the Armistice did not affect the exercise of theright of prize against French ships. Similar decisions were reached, says Rowson,following the surrender of the Greek armed forces.7. Several cases are reported in the Annual Digest of Public InternationalLaw Cases (1943-45). A decision of the Italian Prize Tribunal in 1943 (CaseNo. 166) says that &quot; it is irrelevant that an armistice was in force &quot; i.e., between italy and France-&quot; between the captor State and the State in whose territorial waters the capture was effected if that armistice contains no stipulation relative to the suspension of the exercise of the right of prize.&quot; The German Prize Courtof Hamburg (Case No. 169) dealt with the effect of the armistice between Franceand Germany of 22nd June, 1940. On the following day a French fishing vessel was captured by German forces and seized in prize. The Court said:  &quot; The question whether an armistice in the absence of express provisionsprevents the continued exercise of prize rights is controversial; some nations would allow it, while others deny it. Modern German writers are nearly all of the opinion that trade war and with it the exercise of prize law continuesafter an armistice. The German Prize Code of 28th August, 1939, supportsthese views ... an armistice does not entail peace but merely a respitefrom active warfare. It puts an end to purely military warfare. Measureswhich counter the enemy belligerents forces not directly but indirectly, con-tinue in land warfare; and no less in naval warfare in the continued applicationof prize lav/. Otherwise indeed, the military situation might be changed, inparticular the enemy might replenish his warlike supplies by carriage from&apos; overseas &apos;.&quot;conclusions. It is difficult to draw any certain conclusions from these somewhat con-fused and contradictory pronouncements. Basically, the question appears to turnupon the point of principle, namely, what in the absence of express stipulation is
forbidden under an armistice. The rule laid down by Vattel and followed by otherwriters was that everything was permissible except acts of hostility properlyso called. This, too, is the opinion of Grotius who said (Book III, Chapter 21,Section 6):  &quot; Those acts are in effect illegal which are acts of hostility whether directed against persons or against things, that is to say, any act of violence against theenemy.&quot;But then, what is included in the conception of a hostile act? The seizure of cargoes, the exercise of the right of visiting, searching and detaining ships, are certainly acts of war and also acts of force.9. Some of the authorities appear to be trying to distinguish between captureas applied to enemy merchantmen and everything on them, and visit and searchand seizure of contraband in relation to neutral ships, and seem to be saying thatthe prohibition of the former follows as a consequence of an armistice, but not of the latter. This view can scarcely be right. Not only would it give the belligerents greater rights against neutrals than they had against each other, butit would give rise to the logically indefensible situation that enemy commerce was liable to seizure if carried on neutral ships but not if carried on the enemy&apos;s ownships. It would seem that if an armistice does have the consequence of preventingfurther action against enemy merchant shipping, this must necessarily entail asimilar consequence in relation to neutral shipping.10. The practical reason usually given for the view that belligerent rightsmay be exercised against merchant shipping despite an armistice is that otherwise the enemy could use the armistice period to reconstitute his supply position. Thisis certainly true but in no way conclusive for the remedy is at hand, namely to insert an express provision in the armistice providing for the right to continueaction against shipping.11. The most certain factor seems to be the practice of States since 1871 (videparagraphs 1 and 2 above) which certainly supports the view that if maritime rightsagainst merchant shipping are not reserved by an armistice, either expressly orby necessary implication, they are suspended.
