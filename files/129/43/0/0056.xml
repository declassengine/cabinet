US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(50) 30612TH DECEMBER, 19502 ^9 copy NO. 32CABINETMIGRATION POLICYASSISTED PASSAGE AGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations must trouble my colleagues as a matter of urgency with thequestion whether or not we should extend the existing Passage Agreementwith the Government of Australia.2. The question is urgent for two reasons:-(1)    Mr. Menzies raised it with me when I was in Australia and hewill expect to discuss it when he is in London at the beginningof next month for the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting.     Moreover,in fairness both to the Australian authorities and to those ofour people who are thinking of migrating to Australia, we must give the earliest notice of our intentions,(2)     The question of provision in the Estimates for 1951/52 shouldbe decided very soon.3. The Passage Agreement provides for joint assistance by theGovernments of the United Kingdom and of Australia towards the costof passages for persons migrating from the United Kingdom to Australia.It was signed on the 5th March, 194&amp;, came into operation on the 31stMarch, 1947, and expires on the 30th March, 1951.     It was negotiatedunder the terms of the Empire Settlement Acts of 1922 and 1937, whichempower the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations to make arrangements with other Commonwealth Governments or with voluntary organisations for permanent settlement in the overseas countries of theCommonwealth and to contribute thereto from United Kingdom public funds up to a maximum expenditure per annum of  1,500,000.     These Actsexpire on the 31st May, 1952.4. I had myself thought that our right policy was to renew the PassageAgreement with Australia for a limited period of one year so that it mightrun (roughly) till the expiry of the Empire Settlement Acts, when we mustin any case consider our whole policy on this matter.     When I was inAustralia both the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) and the Minister of immigration (Mr. Holt) strongly urged me to continue our financial con-tribution towards passages, partly because the Australian government attach importance to them, partly to help the Australian Government tonegotiate similar Agreements with the Netherlands, Italy and Germany.(I might mention here that a Migration Agreement has in fact since been negotiated between Australia and the Netherlands under which both Govern-ments will contribute towards the cost of passages. )

29 05. Now, however, the need for greatly increased expenditure on defence and consequent economies in other directions have greatly affected the situation.     On receipt of the Chancellor^ letter to his colleagues ofthe 24th November, in which he asked us to ensure that our Estimates ofexpendit are for the coming financial year omit everything that we do not personally consider to be absolutely essential, I felt bound to re-examinethe matter.     I have reached the conclusion that I should recommend thatwe do not extend the Passage Agreement.     This would mean bringing toan end on the 30th March, 1951, our assistance to the cost of passages toAustralia.     The estimated saving on the present basis is estimated roughlyat  1,43 5,000, though I must mention that - when I earlier thought of recommending extension of the Agreement - I was clear that we must put a ceiling on our expenditure and I was then suggesting a maximum of  1,000,000.6, I recognise that a decision in this sense will be a profound dis-appointment to the Australian Government.     It may also very well inviteattack at home, mainly from the Opposition but also from other quarters,There may also be suggestions that the decision reflects a fundamental change in what has hitherto been the declared policy of the Government offavouring and encouraging intra-Commonwealth migration.7. I must defend the decision, if my colleagues accept it, mainly onthe grounds of the urgent need for economy.     But I would also like to use the argument that it is no longer appropriate to pay people to emigrate.That policy originated in, and belongs to, the days of mass unemployment.We wish to encourage, and will encourage, migration in many ways, butnot in this way.8. I may well be asked whether this means that we have decided notto extend the Empire Settlement Acts when they expire at the end of May,1952.     I am myself inclined to think that we should let these Acts lapse:but I will say that we have not yet come to a decision in the matter.     Infact, we would be a long way committed if we now cut out subsidies underthe Assisted Passage Agreement.9, In order that my colleagues may see the considerations which arise I append to this paper two documents:-(1)     an account of the Assisted Passage Agreement (Annex A);   and(2)     a summary of the principal arguments for and against thecontinuance of assistance from United Kingdom funds towardsthe cost of migration (Annex B).These documents are extracts from a Report on Migration Policy which hasbeen prepared by officials of the Commonwealth Relations Office, Treasury,Home Office, Ministry of Labour and Ministry of Transport, whom theMinisters concerned constituted an Inter-Departmental Committee toreport on these questions.     I also annex (Annex C) a document showing theexpenditure to date under the Assisted Passage Agreement and the probablecost of extending it for one year.

2 3 010,     conclusions therefore ask for my colleagues concurrence in the following recommendations: -(1)     that we should decide now not to renew the PassageAgreement when it expires on the 30th March, 1951;(2)    that I inform Mr.  Menzies in confidence of this decision as soon as possible, with an intimation that there wouldbe an opportunity to talk the matter over when he is inLondon;(3)     that a public statement should be made at the earliest moment after Mr.. Menzies1 visit;(4)     that in defending the decision I should use the arguments which I have outlined in paragraph 7.P.C.G.  W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,12TH DECEMBER, 1950.

AUSTRALIAN ASSISTED PASSAGE agreement,     The Agreement was signed on. 5th March,  1914-6 &quot;between the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs and the Government of Australia to carryout a scheme for joint assistance for persons from the United Kingdomwishing to settle in Australia.      It *arae into operation on 31stMaroh 19U7 for an initial period of 2 years, was renewed in March19U9 for a further period of 2 years, and expires on 30th march  1951. ,    The expenses of the scheme were to &quot;be shared equally betweenthe two Governments,      It was expected that the average Cost of a passage to Australia would he about  70 -  75 , which would costeach Government5 after deduction of the Migrant&apos;s contribution of 10, some  30 -  32.10.0; but before the Agreement had been longin operation it became apparent that the actual cost of passagesespeciallyin the special migrant ships  (which tended to produce littlerevenue on the return voyage)  would be substantially above thesefigures.      It was therefore, agreed between the two Governments thatthe United Kingdom contribution towards each passage should belimited to a maximum calculated on a &quot;normal&quot; fare of  75, i.e.  32.10.0,the migrant&apos;s contribution remaining at  10, and the australian government paying the excess.3*      A year ago, in view of financial stringency, the- United KingdomGovernment were obliged to secure Australian agreement to a further reduction in the United Kingdom liability, under which the UnitedKingdom contribution towards an adult&apos;s fare would not exceed amaximum of  25.      Once again the Australians decided to carry the excess themselves.      This arrangement came into force on 1st April,1950.      Thus, at the present time the adult migrant pays  10, theUnited Kingdom Government pays  25, and the Australian GovernmentPays the balance of a fare which may amount to as much as  120.-lu    The United Kingdom Government provides .free travellingfacilities from the migrant * s home to the port of embarkation,. theAustralian Government from the port of disembarkation to the newresidence.

Should an assisted migrant wish to leave Australia within two years0f his arrival he is liable to repay the amount of the assistance whicho received from the two Governments for his outward passage.g(      Selection  is carried out by the Australian Migration authoritiest Australia House in London.    The United Kingdom c ont ribut ion isutomatically paid in respect  of every selected migrant subject tocertain qualifications.I      Figures of movement and United Kingdom expenditure under the schemeo date, together with estimates for 1950/1 and 1951/2,  are attached asjmex D.J,      During the Secretary of State &apos; s recent tour of Australia he waspproached by the Australian Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) and the minister or Immigration (Mr. Holt), who said that there was some  impression thathe United Kingdom Government were not keen on migration from thenitcd Kingdom.    Australia had been disappointed at the reduction in ourontribution to  25? not  so much because of the  sums involved, butecause-5 with an eye on the demise of the International Refugee Organisa-ion, Australia hoped to get countries like the Netherlands, Germany andtaly to contribute to the cost of passages of migrants, and theustralians&apos;  bargaining position would be stronger if they could say thathe United Kingdom Government did so.    Moreover,  there was considerableesistance in Australia to heavy alien immigrat ion, and anything thatseated the impression that the United Kingdom were not interested inritish migration would increase the Australian Governments difficultiesn obtaining- support for its policy of large alien immigration.    TheUstralian Government themselves wanted to keep British and alien&quot;Migration  in balance.9.      In the course of the discussion the Secretary of State  said thathQ Empire Settlement Acts were soon due to expire, and the United Kingdomovernrnent hod not yet fully worked out their future policy.    He felt that&quot;;Qy would continue to desire steady and large migration to Australia,Since then a migration agreement has been negotiated between Australianu the Netherlands under which both Governments will contribute towards110 cost  of passages.

lut were uncertain of the merits of subsidising tho movement from UnitedKingdom public funds.&apos;   Moreover,  with the extension of social services the cost to the United Kingdom Exchequer of bringing people up to theage of 18 or 20 was becoming steadily greater and Australia  should realise that in letting such people go the United Kingdom was making a considerable and increasing contributionAfter mentioning the higher cost of passages to Australia ascompared with Canada, which would be adverse to migration to australia in the absence of subsidies,  the Australian s asked that in any event the United Kingdom Government should continue their present policy fora few months to enable the Australian Government to conclude their negotiations with others.    The secretary of State said that the UnitedKingdom&apos;s policy would not be altered suddenly or without consultation,and welcomed the  suggestion of Mr. Menzies that Mr. Holt should go toid on to. discuss migration.    This visit was contemplated for Februarylor March 1951.111,       In the light of this discussion, and of other indications of[the importance the Australian Government attach to subsidised Britishigration to Australia and to the United Kingdom Governmenfs)articipation therein,  the Commonwealth Relations Office representativesw the Committee felt that the Assisted Passages Agreement should be^tended on present lines for a&apos; further year,  to March 1952.    This&apos;hile meeting Australian wishes would provide a breathing space forpscussion of the policy to Tie adopted when the Empire Settlement Actspome to an end.    The representatives of the Home Office,  the Ministry of.    ...labour and National Service and the.Ministry-of&apos;-Transport were in favouriL.such..an extension.    It was agreed that the matter should be discussed&quot;Jtsifle the Committee -between the Commonwealth Relations Office and therQasury,    A proposal to this effect has been put to the Treasury but&apos;ith a p-roviso that in the interests of economy a limit of  1,000,000p-ould be placed on the total expenditure of the United Kingdom in  1951/2jjs compared with an estimated expenditure of about1  1 ,-i*3S, 000 if the  schemefVQ to be extended without any special limit on United Kingdom expenditure,

20 &amp;ANNEX BSHOULD THE U.K.  GOVERNMENT - CONTINUE to subsidise INTRA-COMMOKWIiALTH MIGRATION?The main arguments for continuing as a long-term policy tocoiltrio-"to  from United Kingdom funds to the -cost;&apos; of migration fromthi-s country to&apos; other parts of the Commonwealth ares- .(a) By doing so the United Kingdom furnishes practicalproof of the wish of the Government and people ofthis country to facilitate and encourage intra-Commonwealth migration, which for the reasons give already in this report we believe to bedesirable alike in the political and in the overalleconomic interests of the Commonwealth as a whole.To put the point in another way,  should the UnitedKingdom decide to discontinue such assistance andnot to renew the Empire Settlement Acts, whichhave now been in force for nearly 30 years, thiswould almost inevitably be construed, both in thiscountry and elsewhere,  as a sign that, whatever maybe stated publicly, the United Kingdom Governmentarc no longer in favour of emigration.    In thisconnection we would refer again to the conversationcited in paragraph 14 above between the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations and the AustralianPrime Minister and Minister of Immigration, which shows the importance attached by the australian government to the continuance of our contribution tothe Australian Assisted Passage Scheme.(b) In this conversation Mr.  Menzies referred to thedesirability of continuing the United kingdom contribution to the Assisted Passage Scheme fromthe point of view of the negotiations with which the&quot;

20  Australian Government wer ed with the Dutch,* German and Italian Governments for the introductionof immigrants from those countries to Australia.    Hispoint was that,  by contributing to the cost of migra-tion from this country to Australia, the UnitedKingdom Government would supply the australian government with an argument to induce those governments to do the same.    If,  on the other hand, we were to discontinue our contribution,  our example would encourage those Governments to stand out for laying the whole cost on Australia.    This point, has an obvious bearing on the general question of financinglarge-scale migration to relieve the European surpluspopulation problem, the solution of which would be hampered if support were given to claims by emigrationcountries (e.g.   Italy) that the cost should not fall,even in part,  upon them taut should be met by immigra-tion countries or through international funds.(c) Discontinuance of our contribution might lead to asubstantial reduction of the flow of United Kingdommigrants to Australia;    this would be particularly unfortunate at this juncture, when substantial numbersof British migrants are needed to counter-balance thelarge inflow of European refugees and other foreignmigrants.(d) As we have said in the preceding paragraph,  the gainto the Commonwealth as a whole, and particularly toits less populated parts, by migration is from every point of view many times greater than the loss tothis country of the relatively small numbers ofmigrants involved.as   Since then a migration agreement has been negotiatedbetween Australia and the Netherlands under which both Governments will contribute towards the cost ofpassages.

-   (e)    The representative of the Ministry of Labour and national Service felt that partnership in schemes forassisted migration and provisions for joint approvalof assistance to migrants enable the United Kingdom toexercise influence over the recruitment policies and activities of the oversea Commonwealth countries witha view to minimising the loss of categories of workersin short supply here.    The Commonwealth Relations office representatives on the other hand took the view thatcooperation between Commonwealth Governments depends upon established practice and mutual consultation;this would not in fact be seriously affected by theabsence of a joint scheme,(f) The migrant traffic is important to United Kingdomshipping:    from this point of view it would be unfortunate if the authority to stimulate themovement of migrants from the United Kingdom to otherparts of the Commonwealth by making a contribution totheir fares were allowed to lapse altogether.3.-..    The main arguments against continuing as a long-term policy to contribute from United Kingdom funds to the cost of migrationfrom this country to other parts of the Commonwealth are:--(a)    As already pointed out,  at present the australian government is for practical purposes the onlyCommonwealth Government which avails itself of thefacilities provided by the Empire Settlement Acts.The non-renewal of those Acts could therefore hardly be taken amiss by other Commonwealth countries.Moreover the financial assistance provided by theActs is by no means the only practical proof of our sympathy with Commonwealth migration.    Both Australia

and Few Zealand, the only countries with government assisted migration schemes, have been and are beingassisted in every way by the Ministry of Labour, whoplace their Employment Exchanges at the disposal ofthe- Commonwealth migration authorities in London forthe purposes of recruitment and publicity;    and theyhave also enjoyed the benefit of the services of theMinistry of Transport in procuring the necessary shipping for migration at a time of a world shortageof passenger shipping.In 1922, when the first Empire Settlement Act waspassed,  the United Kingdom was faced with heavy and apparently permanent unemployment and it could there-fore be argued that it was to our economic interestto pay people to emigrate rather than to keep themin this country in idleness at the expense of the tax-payer.    Today, with full employment, a labour shortage in certain industries,, which is likely to spread to others as a result of the new Defence Programme, a difficulty in securing recruits for the armed forces,and a stationary and ageing population,  it is clearly not to the economic interest of the United Kingdom to spend large sums of public money on helping some ofthe most productive elements in this country toleave it (and even to contribute towards the faresof trained ex-service men recruited here by other commonwealth Governments for their own forces). Wenote that in his speech in the House of Commons onthe 13th June the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations said &quot;I am not sure whether a subsidy .toencourage people to leave may be part of an outmodedand out of date policy&quot;.    There is thus a distinction

^ 3 Sbetween this country and the foreign countriesreferred to in (b) of the preceding paragraph, whoseeconomic interest in getting rid of their surpluspopulation is at least as great as that of theAustralian Government in securing it.(c) Owing largely to the rise in commodity pricesconsequent upon rearmament the oversea commonwealth countries with which we are concerned are in a relatively much stronger financial position than theUnited Kingdom.    This applies particularly toAustralia, which is more prosperous now than ever before and whose sterling balances are increasing atthe rate of  140 million a year;    New Zealand andSouth Africa are nearly as prosperous.    In the presentdisturbed international situation it  is to be expectedthat this pattern will continue.    Moreover, none ofthese countries is spending so high a proportion ofits national resources on rearmament as :&apos;$ the UnitedKingdom.    It seems therefore that they should be ableto bear the total cost of immigration, as indeed NewZealand already does.(d) In the case of the Australian scheme,  it should alsobe observed that even if the Australian Governmentwere not prepared to take over this- liability them-selves,  it would still be possible,  on the assumptionthat they maintained their present contribution,  fora migrant to go to Australia at a total cost to hirn-self of  35,  which would compare very favourably with the present tourist fare of  53.10s.  to Canada.There is no doubt that the present fare of  10, whichis all that is charged to a migrant,  is very low.Before the war, when the cost of a passage to Australiawas  33,  he was expected to pay  11,   or a third.Today,,  it would not seem unreasonable to require himto pay a substantially higher contribution.
