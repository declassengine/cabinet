[lIS DOCUMENT-IS-THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 301 COPY NO.  325TH DECEMBER, 1950CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS FOR MINERSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the report from the Official Committee on Coal, which is annexed to C.P.(50) 297 (Annex I), contains what seems to me to be awell-balanced statement of the arguments for and against proceeding witha scheme for supplementary pensions for miners.     I think, however, thatit may help the Cabinet to have before them a brief statement indicating the probable cost, on the assumption, which is endorsed by the official committee, that the grant of supplementary pensions to miners would befollowed before long by their extension throughout the socialised industries,with the consequent disappearance of the relatively advantageous positionof the miners.2. This subject was dealt with in a memorandum which was prepared with the advice of the Government Actuary&apos;s Department for the socialisation of Industries Committee in 1949 (S.I.(M)(49) 28).     The cal-speculation of course depends upon the assumed nature of the scheme, and allthat can be done is to give rough estimates on alternative bases.     On theassumption that everybody was ultimately to be brought up to the level ofthe workers receiving the most favourable treatment at present - with,for example, a maximum pension of two-thirds of retiring pay - it was estimated by the Government Actuary&apos;s Department that the contributions in respect of existing employees in the industries then socialised would amount to about 13% of the total wage bill.     If the employees paid 5% (orX/- in the  ) of their weekly earnings, the cost to the Boards would be ofthe order of  34 millions a year, and to the employees about  20 millions a year.     It was calculated that a less ambitious scheme, under which the perision was  1 for every year of contributory service and the employeepaid l/- a week and the employer from 1/- to 2/- a week according to theage of the employee at entry into the scheme, might cost the Boards between 4 and  5 millions a year.     This was on^the assumption that nobody over55 came into the scheme, which would mean that the oldei* of the presentemployees would not benefit.    As regards both these schemes it should beborne in mind, too, that the Socialisation of Industries Committee have always assumed that the cost would be shared equally between Boards and employees.3. These calctilations took no account of the workers in those sections of the transport industry which had not been taken over by theBritish Transport Commission;   and the iron and steel industry had not then been socialised.     The extension of supplementary pensions to the iron andsteel industry and to all transport workers who are likely to be taken over

would add considerably to the cost, particularly in view of the factthat, unlike gas and electricity employees, two-thirds or more of whom were entitled to supplementary pensions at vesting date, few of themenjoy pension rights at present.     Nor, of course, was account taken of the substantial addition to the costs of British industry generallyfrom widespread repercussions elsewhere.H.M.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,5TH DECEMBER, 1950.
