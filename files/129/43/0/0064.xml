2.6.8i DOCUMENT Ii THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA.E TY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(50) 314.13TH DECEMBER   1953CABINETHOUSINGMemorandum by the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland&quot;We have been considering the housing programme in the light ofthe recent consultations which the Minister of Works has had with thebuilding industry and the present uncertainties about the raw materialquestion.2. Now that both sides of the building industry have given theiractive support to the adoption of incentive bonus schemes on house buildingit is reasonable to look forward to more rapid progress and to a reductionin cost  and it should therefore be possible to obtain more houses for thesame amount of capital investment.COPY NC.__.323. The planning of the housing programme is governed by a figure ofcapital expenditure which is settled by the Cabinet after consideration of thecapital investment programme.     For purposes of presentation to Parliament,the Press and to local authorities this capital figure is translated into thenumber of houses which it is estimated can be produced by this expenditure.4. The public presentation of our programme has inevitably in thecircumstances come to be regarded as a declared policy of unwillingnesseither to plan for or to produce more than 200,030 houses a year.     This has put us on the political defensive from which we must extricate ourselves as quickly as possible.5. &quot;We recognise that under present and prospective conditions ofsupply of materials it is unlikely that more than 200,000 houses can be com-pleted in 1951, and in the light of this and of the necessity for providing substantial sums for rearmament in the capital investment programme we arenet in this paper raising the question of the total amount of capital investment for new housing.     That question will, of course, be discussed in theusual way when the capital investment programme for the next year comesup for consideration.i-. We do, however, urge that the presentation of the programme should be such as to make it clear that it is the policy of the Governmentto build as many houses as can be built within the limits of the capital&apos;investment programme and the available supplies of materials and that reference to a particular figure of production should not be as a ceiling ora target, but only as an estimate of what it may be possible to achieve

within the next twelve months with the material resources likely to beavailable.     This presentation seems to us to be of importance both from the point of view of Parliament and the public, and also of thebuilding industry who will naturally expect assurances that they willnot work themselves out of employment by increased productivity anddecreased costs.7. The Minister of Works will, we understand, be making a state-ment to the Press on Friday in the light of his recent consultations withthe building industry and we think it important to secure the rightpsychological approach in any references to the effect of improvedproductivity on housing.8. We ask therefore for authority for a statement to be made onthe following lines:-Now that both sides of the building industry have given their active support to the adoption of incentive bonus schemeson house building it is reasonable to look forward to more rapid progress and to a reduction in cost.     It should therefore bepossible to obtain more houses for the same amount of capitalexpenditure:   it continues to be the policy of the Government tobuild as many houses as can be built within the money limitset by the capital investment programme and the available supplies of materials. -A.B.HdvlcN..13TH DECEMBER, 1950
