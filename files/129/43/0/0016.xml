CtrcuWYed    low So   IXV   ITHIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1950SECRETCP. (50) 2669th November, 1950CABINETSOVIET PROPOSAL FOR MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF FOREIGNMINISTERSMemorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign affairs when my colleagues discussed this matter on 6th November (CM. (50)71st Conclusion, Minute 2) they gave their general approval to the preliminaryviews which I had sent on the preceding day to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors atWashington and Paris for communication to the United States and French Govern-ments (Foreign Office telegram No. 4899 of 5th November to Washington). Inthat telegram I had suggested that it might be desirable, as a first step, to send the Soviet Government an immediate interim reply which should not be negativebut should emphasise that any four-Power discussions must deal not with Germanyalone but with the underlying causes of the present international tension.These views were communicated to the State Department by His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington, and on 6th November I received from the UnitedStates Embassy in London the United States Government^ preliminary comments on the Soviet proposal. These were in general accord with our own views, buton the point of immediate action Mr. Acheson felt that it would be preferable that the first response of the three Western Powers should take the form not ofan interim reply to the Soviet Government but of public statements. Mr. Achesonaccordingly proposed to make such a statement himself at his weekly press conference on 8th November and the United States Embassy gave me the draftof what he proposed to say.Since Mr. Acheson could scarcely avoid making some statement at his press conference I decided to fall in with his proposal. I arranged for certain commentsand suggestions to be conveyed to Mr. Acheson on the content of his draft. these were taken into account by the State Department, and the statement which mr. Acheson eventually made on 8th November (a copy of which is at Annex A)followed closely our own ideas.The French Cabinet also considered the Soviet proposal on 8th November and issued a brief statement to the effect that they proposed to enter into consultationwith the British and United States Governments in order to examine the conditions under which a positive response might be given to the Soviet proposal.I now consider that it would be useful if, without prejudice to further discussion between the three Governments on the manner in which this matter is to be handledin the future, a statement were to be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.I accordingly circulate as Annex B, for consideration by my colleagues, the draft ofa statement which, if approved, I would propose to make in the House of commons on Monday, 13th November.E. B.Foreign Office, SWA,9th November, 1950.Copy No,3239631
annex AStatement by Mr. Acheson on Soviet Proposal for a Meeting of theCouncil of Foreign MinistersWe are of course giving careful consideration, in consultation with the Frenchand British Governments, to the Soviet proposal for a meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers on demilitarisation of Germany. We find it somewhat extra-ordinary that the Soviet Government should be so eager that this meeting be heldpromptly. The Soviet Government delayed for over five months its reply to ournote of last May calling upon the Soviet authorities in Germany to disband the extensive and heavily armed paramilitary forces which they have created in theEastern Zone. The belated Soviet reply completely evaded the issue.Furthermore, I should like to point out that at the Council of Foreign ministers in the spring of 1949 five futile weeks were devoted to discussion of Germany andno progress was made in the face of Soviet intransigence. At that same meeting,however, those essential elements of an Austrian Treaty, still in dispute after three years of negotiation, were agreed and it was assumed that a treaty wouldbe concluded very shortly. Yet during the ensuing year and a half the U.S.S.R.has prevented the conclusion of that treaty by repeated introduction of new andirrelevant issues into the negotiations. In deciding how a further meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers could in fact serve the interests of world peace, wemust clearly consider the extent to which the decisions of the previous meetinghave or have not been carried out.Finally, I should like to point out that Germany is not a problem which canbe isolated from the context of similar areas of tension elsewhere. It is but oneof many issues which Soviet policy since the end of the war has thrust upon theworld. Other nations are being subjected to an increasing war of nerves and insome cases to actual aggression.It is for these reasons that the free world is rearming and mobilising its strength and resources. It will continue to do so until these legitimate fears areremoved. However, it is our most earnest desire that these fears be removed andwe would welcome an opportunity to lessen them. If discussions are to contribute to this desired end, they must be based upon evidence of a genuine desire and intention to reach agreements which would remove or alleviate the threats to world security and not merely upon a desire to exploit for propaganda purposes thelongings of all peoples for peace.We shall reply in due course to the Soviet note but the issues involved are far too serious to admit of hasty treatment.ANNEX draft Statement by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on theSoviet Proposal for a Meeting of the Council of Foreign ministers the Soviet Governmenfs note of 3rd November to the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, France and the United States proposed that the Council ofForeign Ministers of the four countries should meet to examine the question ofcarrying out the Potsdam Agreement on the demilitarisation of Germany. It claimed that the communique issued on 21st October by the meeting in Prague containedproposals directed, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, towards an earlypeaceful settlement for Germany and the carrying out of the demilitarisation ofGermany.His Majesty&apos;s Government are considering the Soviet Governmenfs proposal in consultation with the French and United States Governments.But in their opinion the Prague communique affords no basis for discussion.It contains proposals that have been made before and are manifestly inacceptableto the majority of the German people.   Moreover, despite the representations
addressed to it by the Western Powers on this subject in May last, the SovietGovernment has so far refused to disband the large and heavily armed quasi-military organisation that has been created in Eastern Germany. This and other violations of the Potsdam Agreement by the Soviet Government suggest that discussionsdesigned to secure the carrying out of that Agreement could have little purpose orreality so long as there had been no change in the policies of the Soviet Govern-ment as demonstrated by its actions.The present position in Germany and problems arising from Germany areonly the result of Soviet policy since the war, which, by its action both in Germanyand elsewhere, has compelled the free world to take steps to strengthen its common defence. These German problems are therefore only a part of those which willrequire discussion if the underlying causes of the present international tension areto be removed. His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome an opportunity to achieve this end through negotiation. This would be in accordance with the recentresolution of the United Nations, but such negotiations could only be undertakenafter careful preparation and in circumstances which provided a real opportunityto reach a solution of some of the great world problems.Previous meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers have disappointed manyhopes. For instance, at the last meeting in Paris in 1949 agreement was reachedupon the essential points of an Austrian Treaty. But since that time the SovietGovernment, by repeatedly introducing new and irrelevant issues, has prevented the conclusion of the Treaty.This, along with other aspects of Soviet policy, must inevitably be taken intoaccount by His Majesty&apos;s Government in their consideration of the Soviet note withthe French and United States Government.
