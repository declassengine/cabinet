Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 264Sth November, 1950CABINETECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE east memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 28th March I circulated a Report on Economic and Social development in the Middle East during 1949 (CP. (50) 55).2. I now circulate for the information of my colleagues a report on progressduring the current year.3. As stated in CP. (50) 55, one of the main threats to the Middle East, whichin peace and war is an area of cardinal importance to the United Kingdom, is thedanger of disintegration due to the backwardness of many Middle East countries and the opportunities thereby provided for Communist penetration. Improvementin economic and social conditions in the Middle East is essential. The UnitedKingdom has played and continues to play a important part in promoting suchimprovement both through the Development Division of the British Middle EastOffice and through British experts and technicians employed by Middle EastGovernments. These, including teachers, now number over 500.4. Investment for economic development on a very large scale is proposedor is actually in hand in both South and South-East Asia and in Africa. This invest-ment, and also our substantial investment in the Middle East itself (particularly inthe oil industry), will be in grave danger if we fail to take the necessary action insafeguard the Middle East. The assistance which we have already made availableto South and South-East Asia is not far short of the assistance we ourselves havereceived from the United States. If the Middle East falls into hostile hands, it isvery doubtful whether South and South-East Asia could be held and Africa, too,would be wide open to enemy penetration.5. The Middle East, South and South-East Asia and Africa are thus, to alarge extent, inter-dependent. We should ensure that the development of theeconomic resources of this vast region should as far as possible be balanced asbetween areas and properly co-ordinated.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,Sth November, 1950.ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EASTProgress ReportConsiderable progress has been made during the past year but many gapsremain and the rate of progress has been uneven from country to country. efforts are now being made to fill these gaps.39623 * BTMIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT      ::
2Egypt and the Sudan2. Preliminary work on the Owen Falls Project in Uganda, which, togetherwith the other Equatorial Nile Projects, will make an important contribution to theirrigation of Egypt and the Sudan, is continuing. The Egyptian Government have continued to hold up the opening of negotiations regarding the Lake Tana Project;by their insistence on treating the matter as a political issue. It is hoped, however\that agreement may be reached on procedure in the near future. A technicalconference is to be held on 8th November in Khartoum, where Egyptian andSudanese experts will discuss the Fourth Cataract Project, which the egyptian government are anxious to begin as soon as possible.3. As regards other projects in Egypt, the Egyptian Government has engagedSir Murdoch McDonald and Partners to review plans for the Aswan hydro-electricproject (which will probably cost at least  10 million) and is considering plans fora fertiliser plant and an iron and steel works in connexion with the hydro-electricscheme. Meanwhile the Government is gradually carrying out the project for ruralwater supplies (estimated cost  21 million Over the next ten years). A further project for extending irrigation by boring artesian wells in the Qena Province, estimated to cost  8 million, is under consideration. The Egyptian Government are planning to finance all these projects from internal sources.4. Sir Alexander Carr Saunders, Director of the London School of Economics,visited Egypt in August and discussed various aspects of Egyptian social problems with the Egyptian authorities. He is planning to pay a further visit to Egypt later this year. Meanwhile, the Egyptian Minister of Social Affairs, who is responsiblefor the application of the new Egyptian Social Insurance law (covering old age,widows&apos;, orphans&apos; and incapacity pensions and public assistance), paid an officialvisit to this country in October as the guest of His Majesty&apos;s Government to discusssocial problems with the appropriate authorities here. Mr. A. P. Sinker of theTreasury, who visited Egypt in June to advise the Egyptian Government on the reform of their Civil Service, is now paying a further visit to the country and pre-paring detailed recommendations.Iraq5. During the year considerable progress has been made in Iraq. A law pro-viding for the creation of a Central Development Board was approved by the Majlisin May, and now that Nuri Pasha is again Prime Minister, rapid action is being takento set up the Board. The Government have approved the appointment to the Boardof a British Financial Expert (Sir Edington Miller, formerly Financial Secretary ofthe Sudan Government) who will also be Secretary-General of the Board, and of an american Irrigation Expert. Meanwhile, negotiations with the International bank for the loan of $13 million for the Wadi Tharthur flood control project were con-eluded in July. Detailed specifications for the works on this project are being pre-pared by the Iraq Government^ Consulting Engineers and it is likely that tenders for their construction will be invited soon. Work on the Habbaniyah flood controlscheme on the Euphrates is progressing and the scheme is expected to be completed within a year. The International Bank is prepared to consider further assistance and a Bank Mission will visit Iraq next month to examine four additional projects.6. In June final arrangements were approved for the Iraq Government toraise a loan of  3 million through the Export Credit Guarantee Department to meetobligations in connexion with railway development projects.7. As a result of agreement reached between the Iraq Petroleum Company andthe Iraq Government in August, oil royalties will be increased as from 1st January,1950, from 4s. to 65. gold a ton. The arrangement is pending a decision in theBritish Courts regarding the price of gold. At the present rate of production thiswill mean that Iraq&apos;s net receipts from royalties and tax will be increased by about 1 million.Syria, Lebanon and Jordan8. These three countries may be conveniently grouped together as the fieldin which the United Nations Relief and Works Agency principally operates. Allthe three countries have now agreed with the Agency on a programme of worksrelief projects, involving schemes for road construction, afforestation, small irrigation-tion schemes and housing projects.   Unfortunately, owing to shortage of funds and
the heavy calls for direct relief, investment by the Agency in works projects hasbeen very much less than was hoped. As regards the Pilot Demonstration Projectsrecommended by the Clapp Mission, ther/projects for the development of WadisZerqa and Qilt in Jordan await detailed investigation. Th0 Lebanese Governmenthave indicated that they would welcome the Agency&apos;s assistance in connection withthe pilot project recommended for the Lebanon--the survey of the Litani RiverBasin. The Syrian Government have now asked the International Bank for a loan to cover the pilot project recommended for Syria-The Ghab Project and alsocertain other projects - the development of the Port of Lattakia, the Yarmuk hydro-electric project and Khabour irrigation project- -and a mission from the Bank isvisiting Syria shortly. The Syrian Government have also made tentative enquiriesregarding the possibility of direct financial assistance from the United kingdom or the United State of America. French financial interests, with the blessing of theFrench Government, are anxious to participate in development projects in Syriaand the Lebanon. Syrian suspicions of French intentions, however, remain to be overcome. -;9. Sir Murdoch McDonald and Partners have prepared a report for the jordan government on a long-term project for irrigation in the Jordan Valley. It isestimated that the works involved, would cost  23 million. The Jordan Govern-ment have now applied for membership of the International Bank, and it is hopedthat the Bank will be prepared to assist in financing this and other projects, thoughthe servicing of dollar loans presents great difficulties.10. Meanwhile, apart from U.N.R.W.A. funds for relief works, and, in the case of Jordan, our  1 million, loan, no. financial assistance for ecoriofnic develop-ment has been made available to these countries.Ethiopia    -&apos;.   ;.   ,    . 1 - - &apos;   &apos; -   -&apos;11. The International Bank sent a Mission to Ethiopia in June, as a resultof which an agreement was signed between the Bank and the Ethiopian Governmentin September for two loans, totalling $7 million. One for $5 million will be usedfor the rehabilitation and maintenance of the -country&apos;s road system. The other,for $2 million, will provide foreign exchange for projects to be financed by a newEthiopian development bank. The Ethiopian Government agreed to provide thelocal currency costs of these projects, and to the executive authority for the projectsbeing vested in foreign hands. A third loan for telecommunications development is under negotiation.Saudi Arabia12. Considerable capital development, unfortunately not wise in every case,has taken place in Saudi Arabia. There has also been modest but encouragingprogress in the field of agriculture. The Export-Import Bank have now decidedto make a $15 million loan to the Saudi Arabian Government. Of this, $4 million is to be allocated to pier and airport works on Jedda, the construction of the JeddaMecca road and the procurement of some electrical machinery. The balance of$11 million is not yet allocated.Israel13. The Export-Import Bank have already made a loan of $100 million to Israel for development, and there is a possibility that a further loan will be granted.In addition, the Israel Government are aiming at raising $1,500 million to financefurther Jewish immigration. Of this, they are planning to obtain $1,000 million from Jewish sources in the United States and $500 million from internal sources inIsrael and elsewhere.Former Italian Colonies14. In June 1950, with the agreement of the United Nations Commission in libya, His Majesty&apos;s Government asked the United Nations for technical assistancefrom the Specialised Agencies. The United Nations sent a preliminary surveymission (under Dr. Goodrich) to Libya this summer, and on the basis of his reportHis Majesty*s Government submitted an amended request to the Technical Assist-ance Board. This request was granted and discussions are now in progress regardingthe appointment of the first United Nations experts.39623 b 2
Persia &apos; - . .        - &apos;-   ^w-r;:?;j:v..15. Only modest progress was made during the first year of the Seven-year plan. The efforts of the Plan Organisation have been diverted from the balancedprogramme with the emphasis on agricultural development, which the OverseasConsultants Inc. had prepared, to the reorganisation of various State-ownedindustries. In this field.some success has, however, been achieved. The outlook for the second year of the Plan is also not promising owing to financial difficulties and also to organisational changes due to the new Prime Ministers decision todecentralise the implementation of the Plan. The Anglo-Iranian Oil company have, however, agreed to an advance of  8 million On oil royalties, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are prepared to negotiate immediately with the Persian government sterling loan of between  2 and  3 million.16. The International Bank are in principle prepared to grant a loan of$3 million for port improvement at Khorramshahr, but have asked for furtherinformation regarding the two cement projects and the Karraj irrigation project onwhich the Bank&apos;s Mission had reported favourably.17. An Export-Import Bank loan of $25 million, of which $17 million willbe for agricultural machinery and $8 million for road-making equipment, has beenapproved in principle. His Majesty&apos;s Government have offered to provide dollars to service the loan for one year.Persian Gulf18. We have for a considerable time been urging the Sheikh of Kuwait toappoint a British Financial Adviser, in order to ensure that his enormous oilroyalties (estimated at  5^ million this year) will be wisely used or invested. Hehas now asked for British experts to work in the Finance and Customs Department.At the beginning of the year, the new oil port at Mena Al Ahmandi, which has been constructed by the Kuwait Oil Company, was opened. This port is believed to bethe largest of its kind in the world. A water distillation plant is also being installedin Kuwait to replace the present supply of water brought by tanker from theShatt al Arab.19. Oil production in Qatar has begun and is expected to reach li million tonsthis year. The Sheikh of Qatar has appointed a British Adviser.Technical Assistance20. The arrangements agreed with the Treasury in February for subsidisingposts for British experts employed by Middle East Governments are proving ofconsiderable value, although they only cover a very limited field. Great difficulties are still being encountered in recruiting experts for the Middle East, in spite of theefforts for the Ministry of Labour Special Unit and of ourselves. A proposal bySir John Sargent, of the British Council, for the establishment of an OverseasTechnical Service to meet the needs of the Middle East, South-East Asia and theUnited Nations is under inter-departmental consideration. It has now been sug-gested that a small high-level Working Party with a chairman drawn from outside theCivil Service should be set up to examine this proposal and other possible long-termsolutions to the problem. As an immediate measure and a lead in to a futureservice we have suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should finance a small number of temporary supernumerary posts in various institutions from whichexperts could be seconded to posts in the Middle East, and to which they couldreturn for a limited period.21. The State Department have informed us that they are proposing to allocate$l-  million for Point Four assistance to the Middle East, of which $500,000 will befor Persia. Arrangements for co-ordinating American Point Four assistance,with the assistance which we are giving through the British Middle East Officeand other channels, are working well.Islamic Economic Conference22. A member of the Development Division of the British Middle East Officeattended as an observer at the Islamic Economic Conference, which took place atTehran at the beginning of this month.
Anglo-American Talks23. The problems of economic development in the Middle East were discussed with Mr. McGhee, of the State Department, during his visit to this country at theend of September.Conclusions24. Financial assistance for economic development is being, or it is hopedwill shortly be, made available to Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Israel and Persia.No such assistance is in sight for Syria, Lebanon and Jordan (apart from the limitedU.N.R.W.A. funds for relief works, including over  1 million loan to Jordan),The filling of this gap is now a major objective which will call for great efforts duringthe coming year on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the United States Govern-ment, the French Government and the International Bank. The State department are thinking in terms of an economic aid programme for the Middle East and South-East Asia costing $250-$300 million a year for four to five years. If this programme is approved Syria is likely to receive special attention. His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave special interests and responsibilities in Jordan and it is hoped that we willbe able to furnish further aid for Jordan&apos;s economic development. If the SyrianPrime Ministers request for British aid for development projects could be met, evenon a modest scale, it would have the effect not only of enabling an early start tobe made, but also possibly of lessening Syrian resistance to French economic aid,which could play an important part in the economic development of the country.25. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States and French Govern-ments will also be called upon to make special efforts to provide further funds for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which is recommending to theGeneral Assembly the continuation of relief and relief works for a further year andalso the creation of a special Fund for the reintegration of the Palestinian refugees.T.
