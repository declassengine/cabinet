(50) 274\5th November, 1950CABINETBALANCE OF CIVIL pay memorandum by Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will recall the discussion On 1st August (CM. (50)52nd Conclusions, Minute 7) about the payment to Civil Service reservists nowbeing recalled to the Colours of the balance of their civil pay, i.e., the amount bywhich Forces pay may fall short of their civil pay in the Civil Service. It was theftagreed that I should look into the wider question whether this practice, followed inthe last three wars, should be continued in any future war and my conclusions are set out in this paper.2. Under a decision of the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (47) 9th Meeting)balance of civil pay has hot been givefi since 1st July, 1947, to civil servants called upfor national service a decision accepted by the staff without demur. On the Otherhand, nothing has been done to abrogate the war-time practice in the case of thosecalled up before that date and in recent months the Treasury has felt obliged toauthorise Departments to give balance of civil pay to reservists called up as aresult of the Korean war. The socialised industries have also given some formof balance of civil pay to their reservists, but local government have not, sincethe legislation which authorised the practice in local government in the last war has lapsed and would have to be renewed.3.   General Arguments in favour of Civil Pay (a) Under conscription arid the policy of reserved occupations a rriari has hochoice as to the part he plays in a war. It is unjust that the family of aman called up to the Armed Forces should suffer financially comparedwith that Of his colleague retained in civilian employment.(b) There will be a general expectation that the system adopted in the last threewars will be continued in a future war. Moreover, the fact that inrecent months balance of civil pay has been paid to the extent set outin paragraph 2 will not make it any easier to abolish the practice infuture.(c) Even if the Government decided against balance of civil pay, some other employers might regard it as their duty to give it to the families oftheir employees. The Government ought not to appear to offer worsetreatment to public servants than that accorded by the good outsideemployer.4. General Arguments against Civil Pay(a) The original object of the balance of civil pay was to encourage volunteer-ing. In any future war conscription will undoubtedly come into force immediately, and the original motive for balance of civil pay has there-fore disappeared, although it must be admitted that in the 1939 warbalance of civil pay was continued despite the fact that conscriptionwas operative from the outset.(b) Forces pay was once very small indeed, and for the family man withcommitments, balance Of civil pay was the sole protection againstpossibly very considerable hardships. The present position is very different. Forces pay is greatly improved and the supplementaryfamily allowances (not to mention the social services generally) go someway towards meeting the married man&apos;s commitments. War Service39660
Grants will be available as in the past to help men in the Forces tomeet their continuing civil liabilities.(c) Men and women in the Forces who have no balance of civil pay willcontend that there is no justification for giving better treatment to civilservants or to persons employed by public or semi-public bodies,whether or not they are family men who need it, or single personswho can quite well live on their Forces pay. The wider the field over which balance of civil pay is given the greater will be the sense; ofinjustice among those whose pay is not made up.5. Possibility of a modified Balance of Civil Pay Scheme. To my mind thegreatest objection to the present balance of civil pay scheme is that mentioned inparagraph (c) above-that it gives help indiscriminately to certain classes of peoplewhether they need it or not. It would, in theory, be possible to avoid this to someextent by limiting balance of civil pay to the married man, or even to the married man with children; I doubt, however, whether we could in fact confine thepayment to the man with children, since the man with a wife unable to get employ-ment through no fault of her own would have an almost equally strong case forconsideration. I doubt also whether a scheme which gave what might be reallysubstantial benefits only to the married (whose wives might be earning) or onlyto those with children, would commend itself to employers or to public opinion.Finally, I feel in general that if we are to amend the practice of the last three warsat all we should carry the matter to its logical conclusion and abolish the balanceof civil pay system altogether and give help where help is needed through theWar Service Grants Scheme.6. Improvements in the War Service Grants Scheme. Admittedly the schemefor paying War Service Grants in addition to Forces pay appears inadequate todeal with all hardship that results from call up,, especially for those at the higherlevels of pay and with substantial commitments, since the maximum grant is  150, a year. But in my view the proper way to deal with this situation is to improve the scheme and to extend its scope to the higher income levels as a scheme applicableto the whole population, rather than to superimpose on it a system of balanceof civil pay which will remove hardships for a part only of the population.Appendix I to this paper suggests the modifications that might be made to secure this result.7. Finance and Man-power.--While I do not suggest that financial and man-power considerations should be over-riding in this matter, it should be noted thatthere would (for the reasons given in Appendix II) be a saving to the Exchequerif balance of civil pay were abolished even after allowing for the cost of improving the War Service Grants Scheme as proposed in Appendix I. We should also savea considerable number of clerks.recommendation. Though the arguments are evenly balanced, I recommend that in any future war we should not pay balance of civil pay but that we should improve theWar Service Grants Scheme on the lines proposed in Appendix I. I also proposethat whatever we decide to do in any future war should determine our practice inpeace.9. Application of this Recommendation to other Services. If the Cabinetaccept my recommendation, I assume that my colleagues responsible for the other public services (local government, the police, teachers, socialised industries, national health Service, B.B.C., &amp;c.) will agree that balance of civil pay should not be paidin those services in the event of war and that no further persons should receivethese payments at the present time. If, on the other hand, my proposals are rejectedand balance of civil pay is to be perpetuated in the Civil Service and paid to CivilService reservists called up in time of peace, it will, I imagine, be exceedingly difficult for any other policy to be adopted in the other public services. So far asthe local government service is concerned, this would necessitate legislation toauthorise the payment of balance of civil pay in peace or in a future war.H. G.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,\5th November, 1950. ^
APPENDIX I suggested modifications in War Service Grants scheme. The War Service Grants Scheme of the last war had two main limita-tions:  (i) It met only &quot; essential, inescapable and irreducible &quot; commitments whichwere interpreted as covering: rent, rates, insurance premiums, hire purchase of necessary household furniture, contributions to superannua-tion funds, education expenses, and expenses in connection with chronicillness.(ii) The maximum grant was  3 a week.2. It was, therefore, in essence a scheme which provided adequately for thelower income groups but inadequately for the middle and upper groups.3. The alterations which would be required to make this scheme an adequatesubstitute for balance of civil pay would be the raising of the maximum grant to,say,  500 and the interpretation of &quot; essential, inescapable and irreducible &quot; com-commitments with some regard to the previous standard of living of the man concerned.APPENDIX IIThe comparative cost in money and manpower of abolishing balance of civilpay and of improving the war service grants scheme. The cost of balance of civil pay if administered on the same lines as inthe last war would be considerable. It is impracticable to give a considered estimatesince there are so many unknown factors. We start without precise knowledge ofwhat it cost in the last war though from the Post Office figure of  23 million itwould be reasonable to conclude that for the Civil Service as a whole the cost musthave exceeded some  50 million for the war and immediate post-war period. that figure, however, is little guide to what the cost might be in a future war. If militarypay is higher in relation to civil pay (as seems likely) this would mean a considerablesaving. On the other hand, the socialised industries and the National health service would almost certainly have to follow the Civil Service practice and thiswould increase the direct or indirect charge on the Exchequer. In view of allthese uncertainties, one cannot be precise as to the extent of the saving but itis reasonably clear that the cost of balance of civil pay would still be heavy in any future war.2. On the other hand, the cost of the improvements to the War Service grants scheme suggested in Appendix I should be exceedingly small. Again it is imprac-ticable to give further estimates. We know that during the war and the immediate post-war period, total grants under the Scheme amounted to about  75 million, the grants in a peak year totalling  18 million. We also know that there were about1 million separate awards. Higher service pay so far as it applies to the Forcesin time of war will reduce the number of grants and thus the cost of the Scheme.On the other hand, the raising of the maximum grant as suggested in Appendix Iwould off-set these savings. It is, however, almost certain that the additional expenditure thereby caused would be very small. The number of conscripts in themiddle income groups with family commitments in excess of  150 a year is comparatively small. In short, the alterations proposed in the War Service grants scheme would be of greater political than financial significance.3. On financial grounds, therefore, the abolition of civil pay is clearly desir-able even after taking into account the cost of improving the War Service grants scheme.  The saving to the Exchequer would, of course, be reduced to the extent
to which it was decided to retain a modified form of balance of civil pay such asis discussed in paragraph 5 of the memorandum.4. A large number of clerks were required to administer the balance of civilpay scheme in the last war and much the same number would be needed in any future war if the scheme were fuft on the same lilies.. Abolition Of the system would obviate their employment. The improvement of the War Service grants scheme proposed in Appendix I would increase&apos; the number Of clerks recjuiredfor that scheme but the number so required would be smaller than that saved onthe civil pay scheme, because the number of cases in the latter scheme would be far larger (comprising persons in ail income groups) than the number added to theWar Service Grants Scheme, who would be confined to the far smaller middle and upper income groups.
