this document  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT    163SECRETCopy No.32CP. (50) 29029th November, 1950CABINETPURCHASE OF POLISH coal memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach, for the consideration of my colleagues, a report by the overseas negotiations Committee on the proposal of the Minister of Fuel and Power(CP. (50) 285) to initiate negotiations for the purchase of up to 1 million tons ofcoal from Poland.29th November, 1950.PROPOSED PURCHASE OF POLISH COALReport by the Overseas Negotiations Committee1. introduction the Overseas Negotiations Committee have given urgent consideration to theproposal which the Minister of Fuel and Power is putting to the Cabinet that theNational Coal Board should be authorised to negotiate for the purchase of up to1 million tons of coal from Poland.   The purpose of this report is to analyse(i) the implications of the proposal in the context of East/West trade restrictions,(ii) the repercussions of the proposal on our relations with other countries.2. The Present position the Overseas Negotiations Committee understand that the present positionis as follows:  (a) The Polish representatives on the Coal Committee of the economic commission for Europe at Geneva have informed a representative of theNational Coal Board that the Poles would be willing to provide up to1 million tons of coal, either for use in the United Kingdom or forresale, especially to Denmark and Eire.(b) It has been stressed that the Poles would want the proposal to be thesubject of formal discussions under the Anglo-Polish Five-Year trade agreement of 1949.(c) The Poles would expect to be able to use the sterling for the purchase ofespecially useful goods, and have indicated their interest in commercialships of about 10,000 registered tons.3. The Object of the Proposed purchase the shipment of coal from Poland to the United Kingdom could not, for physical reasons, be at a greater rate than 100,000 tons a month, but the Ministryof Fuel and Power urgently need, for use in the United Kingdom, the 300,000 tons which could be shipped from January to March next. The question of pursuingthe Polish offer of 1 million tons in full would depend on whether it were consideredH. G.
advantageous either to use the balance of 700,000 tons for stocking during the summer, or to make the balance available, between January and March, to theNational Coal Board to enable it to meet existing overseas contractual obligations.It would be physically possible to deliver the whole of the 700,000 tons toScandinavian countries within the period January to March.4. The East I West Trade Issue(i) The Poles are extremely short of sterling, partly due to a shortfall in theirtimber exports, and they would, no doubt, be glad to earn additional sterling toenable them to purchase raw materials in the Sterling Area. We could accept thisprospect, as we have done in the recent purchase of coarse grains from Russia.But ihe Poles could sell their coal for sterling to a number of other european countries, and the strong probability is, therefore, that in return for the sale ofcoal to us they would demand trade concessions which are likely to be inconsistent with our agreement with other O.E.E.C. countries on East/West trade. Thissuspicion is confirmed by the points already made by the Poles, referred to inparagraph 2 (b) and (c) above; in particular, we could not supply commercial ships of 10,000 registered tonnage, as the East/West trade restrictions Would only permit the supply of ships of less than 7,000 tons, with a maximum speed of 10 knots.(ii) The Committee therefore recommend that if Ministers consider thepurchase of up to 1 million tons of Polish coal is necessary, negotiations with thePoles should be started forthwith but the position should be reviewed when it isknown precisely what trade concessions the Poles demand.5. Repercussions on other Countries of Imports of Polish CoalIn so far as the import of Polish coal into the United Kingdom (whether300,000 tons or the whole 1 million tons) is necessary Ministers will, no doubt,regard this consideration as of overriding importance. The Committee feel,however, that they should indicate that the purchase must be expected to be resentedby other countries, particularly the Scandinavian countries, whose needs for UnitedKingdom coal we shall be unable to meet in 1951. Poland is an obvious alternativesource to which such countries will look to obtain the supplies which they havehitherto expected from us, and our purchases will reduce their ability to obtain thesupplies they need. United Kingdom purchases from Poland will be very different from their point of view from dollar purchases in the United States.6. Purchase of Polish Coal for Re-saleThe O.N.C would not, on the whole, favour the proposal that 700,000 tonsof the proposed purchase from Poland should be used for re-sale to othercountries. The proposal would, of course, enable the National Coal Board tomeet some of its contractual obligations, but the following objections are, in theCommittee&apos;s view, of greater weight:  (i) Subject to (ii) below, the countries to which we re-sold the coal would notgain any net benefit. They could themselves obtain the coal direct from poland.(ii) Polish coal is dearer than United Kingdom coal. The countries to whichwe re-sold the coal would therefore only gain in so far as we wereprepared to sell it to them at a loss, and it is assumed that this is outof the question.(iii) The re-sale of Polish coal to Denmark and Eire will apparently be acceptable to the Poles, but we do not think that they would agree tothe re-sale to Scandinavian countries other than Denmark, and it would obviously be very difficult for us to make supplies of Polish coalavailable to Denmark and not to other Scandinavian countries.7. summary the conclusions of the Committee are therefore as follows:  (a) If Ministers consider the purchase of up to 1 million tons of coal isnecessary, negotiations with the Poles should be started forthwith, butas the Poles are likely to demand in return trade concessions which are inconsistent with the East/West trade restrictions, the position shouldbe reviewed when it is known precisely what the Poles demand inreturn.
(b) The import of Polish coal for use in the United Kingdom may be expectedto be resented by other countries, particularly the scandinavian countries, who will look to Poland as an alternative source for coal supplies which the United Kingdom will be unable to deliver in 1951.(c) Although the re-sale of 700,000 tons of Polish coal would enable theNational Coal Board to meet some of its contractual obligations, it is notfavoured by the Committee for the reasons set out in paragraph 6.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28 th November, 1950.
