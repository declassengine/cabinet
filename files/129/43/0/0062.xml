^hHlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET 269CP. (50) 3IZ COPY NO. 3212TH DECEMBER, 1950CABINETSOVIET PROPOSAL FOR A MEETING OF THE COUNCILOF FOREIGN minister&apos;s memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs with reference to C. P. (53) 294 and to the discussion on 5th Decemberrecorded in CM. (50) 82nd Conclusions, I attach at Annex rAl the text ofthe draft reply to the Soviet Note of 3rd November which the meeting of officials in Paris on 7th/Sth December agreed to submit to the three governments.2. Subject to any amendments that may be proposed by the Frenchand United States Governments, I recommend that this draft be approved.3. In accordance with the Cabinet decision of 5th December, the conversations in Paris concentrated on the preparation of a draft reply. &apos; Therewas some discussion on the purposes of the Soviet, approach and agreement that it aimed primarily at delaying our rearmament and at seeking to divideus.    It was recognised that the meeting was a preliminary one and, althoughM. Parodi, the Secretary-General of the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs,suggested that we should discuss the positions of the three Governments on thevarious issues which might arise from .a Council of Foreign Ministers, it wasreadily agreed that this would be inopportune at the moment.    Further, itwas agreed that the draft reply should be constructive in tone and that thebasis proposed by the Soviet Government was too narrow.   Both the Frenchand American Delegations shared very closely our ideas as. to the form thedraft should take, and there was little difficulty in reaching agreement on the wording.4. The draft (Annex &apos;A&apos;) follows generally the arrangement of theoriginal American draft, which is attached to CP. (50) 294, but is moreforthcoming.   In fact, it follows more closely the alternative draft submittedby our Delegation.    It falls into four main sections.    First, there is an expression of our peaceful intentions and readiness to meet and try tonegotiate a settlement;   secondly, an explanation why neither the question ofthe demilitarisation of Germany nor the German question as a wholeconstitutes an adequate basis for four-Power talks;   thirdly, it gives thereasons why, if these talks are tc be- useful, the basis must be widened;   and,finally, makes a positive proposal that representatives of the four powers should meet at New York and try to agree on.such a wider agenda.5. &quot;Without appearing too optimistic, the tone of the draft looks forward to a meeting.   In spite of some hesitation on the part of the French, it mentionsAustria as well as Germany as subjects to be discussed.   It does not attempt tolist, or even to suggest, any other specific subjects, since it was generally felt that at this stage it would be difficult to do this without running the riskof seeing subjects included which we might find it awkward to discuss, or of&apos;d

having to omit subjects, the omission of which-we might find it difficultto explain to the countries concerned.    Furthermore, there was considerablereluctance on the part of the Americans to saying anything which mightcommit us to discussing the Far East with the Russians at the Council ofForeign Ministers.6. The one point which was reserved was whether reference shouldbe made to the recent Iraqi-Syrian Resolution.    Our Delegation was in favourof including it, since to propose a wider agenda would be in accordancewith the spirit of that Resolution.   Both the French and the Americans, however,felt that to refer specifically to a resolution which recommends discussing with the other States concerned all problems likely to threaten international peace would make it very difficult for us to refuse any Russian suggestionthat the Chinese should be brought into the talks for discussion of far eastern affairs.   On the whole I feel that the passage in question (the last sentence of paragraph 5 of Annex &apos;Al) should be omitted.7. It was agreed to consult the three Governments about referringthe text of the draft to the Federal Government.   The Americans urgedthat we should, if not consult Dr. Adenauer, at least give him time to comment.The French thought it desirable that we should give the Benelux Governmentsadvance copies of the draft, and our Delegation that in that case theAustrian Government should be treated equally.   We certainly have to take account of Dr. Adenauer&apos;s feeling and Germany is closely interested in thefour-Power talks, but there is nothing in the draft to which the Germans arelikely to object, and we do not want to do anything which would commit usto consulting the Germans at the actual Council of Foreign Ministers when thefuture of Germany will be more closely involved than it is at this stage.I would therefore favour instructing the High Commissioners to show thedraft to Dr. Adenauer 24 hours before it is handed to the Soviet government but without inviting comments and without committing us to accept any suggestions he may volunteer.    This course is also favoured by our HighCommissioner.   In view of their interests, I would also send copies of thedraft to the Benelux and Austrian Governments 48 hours before it is delivered.It will no doubt also be desirable to send advance copies to the commonwealth governments.8. When the three Governments have approved the text, the timing ofthe next step will have to be agreed.     We shall have to decide, with theFrench and the Americans, whether to hold up an approach to the federal government about German rearmament until we have seen the outcome of theproposal for four-Power talks.    Both the French and the Americans are alsoanxious that we should press on with the second stage which will have tofollow if the Russians accept our proposal for exploratory talks in New York.They both emphasised the great importance of full and frank discussions between the three Powers to ensure that we know what we want on the various questions which will arise and that we are agreed in face of the Russians.9. I append at Annex &apos;B&apos; the record of a conversation with theSecretary-General of the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the possible consequences of the Soviet proposal which will, I think, interest my colleagues.E.B.Foreign Office, S, W. 1. ,

H.M. Embassy has the honour to acknowledge thereceipt of the note of 3rd November from the Soviet Ministryof Foreign Affairs.    This note, to which was- attached the text of a communique published in Prague by the SovietGovernment and those of its allies, proposed a meeting of theCouncil of the Foreign Ministers of the United States ofAmerica,  the United Kingdom, of France and of the Soviet union for the purpose of examining the question of the execution ofthe provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the demilitarisation of Germany.2.       His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, likethe Governments of the United States and France, have alwaysabided by the principle of the Charter of the United nations that international problems should be settled by peacefulnegotiation.    His Majesty&apos;s Government take this opportunityof reaffirming their adherence to this principle.    Theyhave no aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union;they are animated by a sincere desire to put an end to international tension and will spore no effort to reach sohighly desirable an end.    They are ready,  on the lines and&apos;according to the method indicated below, to examine with theUnited States, French and Soviet Governments,  the possibilityof finding a mutually acceptable basis for a meeting of theForeign Ministers of the four countries.3.        His Majesty&apos;s Government have examined with care the note,  addressed to thern by the Soviet Government on 3rdNovember last.    They are obliged with regret to note that thebasis of discussion proposed in that note is not such as tohold out the prospect of a real settlement.    The soviet proposal to examine the question of the demilitarisation ofGermany will not suffice to remove the causes of the presenttension.    There exists to-day no German military force otherthan the units which have been in existence for several monthsDRAFT REPLY TO SOVIET NOTE OF 3rd NOVEMBER

in the Sovxet Zone and which are given military trainingincluding the use of artillery and tanks.    If the partici-pation of Western Germany In its own defence is to-daybeing studied it is solely because Soviet policy obliges theother Nations to examine every means of improving their security.    Contrary to the quite inaccurate allegations inthe Prague communique, His Majesty&apos;s Government, in common with the two other Western Occupying Powers, are determinednever,  in any circumstances or at any time, to allow the Zonewhich they administer in Germany to be used as a base foraggression.k*        Nor is it possible to envisage a just settlement ofGerman problems on the basis of the Prague communique.    Thiscommunique contains no new or constructive feature and hasbeen rejected by the majority of the German people.    It doeslittle more than reiterate in substance earlier proposalswhich proved, after detailed examination,  to offer no basis for a positive solution of the German problem.    With the objectof putting an end to the present division of G-ermany, HisMajesty&apos;s Government p  together with the United States andFrench Governments,  have more than once made proposals for restoring German unity by means of free elections under international control.    These proposals formed the subjectof letters from the three High Commissioners to the Presidentof the Soviet Control Commission on 25th May and 9th october last.    These letters have remained unanswered.5.        The causes of the serious tension which exists to-daydo not spring from the German problem alone.    They resultprimarily from the general attitude adopted by the SovietGovernment since the war and from international developments of recent months.    The Governments of the four Powers wouldbe failing in their responsibilities towards the peoples ofthe world if they confined their discussions to the narrowbasis proposed by the Soviet- Government.    Although questions relating to Germany and Austria would have to figure on theagenda, His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that, in order to

give the Council of Foreign Ministers reasonable chance ofsuccess, the agenda should also include the principal problemswhose solution would make possible a real and lastingimprovement in the relations between the Soviet Union and theother three Powers.    Such an agenda would be in conformitywith the resolution adopted by the General Assembly of theUnited Nations on the 3rd November which invited thePermanent Members of the Security Council to meet and discusscollectively or otherwise and if necessary with other states concerned all problems which are likely to threaten world peace and hamper the activities of the United Nations.6.        His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared.to nominate anofficial who,  in agreement with representatives of the UnitedStates, French and Soviet Governments,  could draw up an agenda sufficiently wide to permit the Council of foreign ministers to meet with a reasonable chance of success.    Thepreliminary meeting entrusted with the preparation of a draftagenda could take place in New York where the representativesof the Four Governments on the Security.Council of the united nations are already assembled.7.        His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to learn theviews of the Soviet Government on the proposals put forward in this notee

ANNEX  &apos;BM. PARODI (Franeex	, MR.   BRUCE AND MR.  BOHLEN (UNITEDSTATES OP AMERICA	and SIR OLIVER HARVEY and MR. MALLET(UNITED KINGDOM)&quot;After the meeting at the Quai d&apos;Orsay on 3th december to discuss the draft reply to the Soviet proposal for a council of Foreign Ministers, M, Parodi invited Sir 0. Harveyand me with Mr. Bruce and Mr. Bohlen to his room to make a confidential conTiiunication which took the following lines.2.        Mr. Parodi began by saying that he was anxious about what the proposed four-Power conversations might lead to.The question of the rearmament of Germany was a very seriousone for Russia and the Soviet Government must be gravelyanxious about the ultimate effects of a decision to rearmGermany.    They knew today that they could easily overrunEurope and seize its industry more or less intact.    In three or four years our rearmament effort might make this much lesseasy.    M. Parodi therefore wondered whether our present policy might not be pushing Russia to the attack.    It was said thatif Russia was going to attack, she would do so in any case,but he was not convinced by this line of talk.    The rearmament -ment of Germany would alter the calculations on which this estimate of Soviet intentions was based.    There was a great difference between the rearmament of the United States, UnitedKingdom and France and that of Germany:    our own insistence on german co-operation proved how important it was.3.        M. Parodi emphasised that    he was not going back ondecisions taken elsewhere but felt that it would be most unwise to ignore the warnings the Russians had given.    The decisionswe would have to take would be of grave importance and of muchgreater risk than three or four months ago &quot;when it appeared that the Soviets had made a bad mistake in Korea.    It was nowevident that they had cold-bloodedly decided to take the riskof a general war.    This was the conclusion that must be drawn from the decision of the Chinese Government to Intervene asthey had in Korea.    If the Russians were ready to risk a general war and the use of the atom bomb they were ready to face warin Europe, and if the four-Power talks failed to materialiseor came to nothing the West might be faced with a Sovietultimatum.h.        M. Parodi said that he spoke with the approval ofM. Schuman.    The French Government might decide to raise these issues in a more official way, but M. Parodi felt itnecessary that all three Governments should now consider thepossibilities which he hod mentioned and consider what weshould do if they aripe.    Later M. Parodi added that it was largely a question of timing.    In two or three years theWest might be strong enough to discourage the Russians(particularly, M.  de Margerie added, if the Americansfulfilled their promises of aid and increased their assistance).5.        Mr. Bohlen replied that ho was not much impressed- bythe argument about timing.    Even with the armaments whichthe West might expect to have in two or three years&apos;time,  the Soviet superiority on land would remain immense andby that time Russia might have evolved an effective defence system again, t long-range bombing.

6,       He said that in his view events in Korea did not.mean that Soviet policy had changed or that the SovietGovernment had decided to accept the risks of a general war.He did not think that the prospect of even considerablylarger German forces than those now contemplated could genuine-ly frighten the Russians who were relatively so much stronger,than in 1939.    He recognised, however, that Russia v/ould beperturbed by German rearmament and would dislike it intensely.But by the side of Russia&apos;s historic nervousness about germany was to be put the Soviet ambition to secure control ofGermany and of her industry and so of Europe as a whole.Russia had to choose between fear of Germany and desire to possess her, and Mr. Bohlen&apos;s view was that she stillthought she could get possession of Germany by peaceful means.    For this purpose she wished Germany to be weak and wished the links between Germany and the West to be weak.She therefore directed her propaganda to persuading us that she would attack if we tried to make Germany strong.7.       Finally, Mr. Bohlen said that if the Western Powersgave way before this threat they would later be faced witha demand for the dissolution of the &quot;aggressive&quot; Atlantic Pactor for the withdrawal of &quot;aggressive&quot; United states forces, and so on down the slippery slope.8.        Sir 0. Harvey, who had not yet seen the decision aboutGerman rearmament in Washington telegram No.  3309,confined himself to emphasising the importance of building up the forces of the Wost and said that he would reportMr. Parodi&apos;s communication.
