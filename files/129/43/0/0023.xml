L J^t,. 17/11/so *xrf*^ 7 gTHIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1950SECRETCP. (50) 27315th November, 1950CABINETRENT RESTRICTIONS ACTSMemorandum by the Minister of Health and Secretary of State for: scotland at the meeting of the Cabinet on 20th October, 1950 (CM. (50)66th Conclusions, Minute 4), we were invited to submit a Memorandum on thepoints at which the Rent Restrictions Acts stood in need of amendment.2. An Interdepartmental Committee, with Lord Ridley as Chairman, wasappointed in November 1943 &quot; to review the question of rent control, including theworking of the Rent Restrictions Acts and to advise whether any, and if so what,changes are necessary.&quot; The Committee reported in 1945, the three labour members of the Committee signing the Report subject to reservations. We referbelow to the main recommendations of the Committee and the main reserva-tions of the Labour members, and to one or two other important amendments ofthe Rent Restrictions Acts the need for which has been demonstrated since theCommittee reported.Co-ordination of the law3. The Committee regarded it as urgently necessary that the present chaosof overlapping legislation should be replaced by a single comprehensive Act inwhich the whole law relating to rent control should be clearly set out. At thetime of the Committee&apos;s Report there were nine Acts: now there are eleven. Ifthere is to be any major amendment of the Acts this highly desirable co-ordinationshould be undertaken at the same time.Scope of the Rent Restriction Acts4.- The Acts now apply to houses of rateable value not exceeding  100 inthe Metropolitan Police district,  75 in the rest of England and Wales and  90 inScotland. The Committee did not recommend an extension of scope to includelarger houses because, they stated, they had little evidence to show need for it.Post-war conditions, however, have proved to be such that many tenants of theselarger houses have suffered through lack of protection against eviction (for thepurpose of enabling the landlord to reap vacant possession value) or againstexorbitant increases of rent on renewal of tenancies. If the Rent Restrictions Actsare amended there will be a strong case for extending their scope to the larger houses.Registration of rents5. The Committee recommended that local authorities should be required toset up and maintain a register of the rents of all houses, excluding sub-lettings, intheir area to which the Rent Restrictions Acts apply. This they regarded as necessary in order to avoid disputes, uncertainty and the evasion of the Acts, andas a basis of the scheme of Rent Tribunals which they recommended. The net cost to the local authorities should, they suggested, be reimbursed by the Exchequer.At the recent Margate Conference, the Party Executive accepted a resolution calling for registration of rents with local authorities.39653Copy No.31
Rent Tribunals6. The Committee found that the effect of the Acts, through control, decontroland recontrol, had been very uneven, rent for similar houses in the same localityranging from 50 per cent, to 150 per cent, or more of the gross value of the houses.They recommended the appointment of Rent Tribunals as the only way to producereasonable uniformity of rent levels. The Tribunals, they suggested, should, ohapplication from landlord or tenant, fix fair rents for all unfurnished and furnishedlettings and the work should be completed within three years, an order of prioritybeing indicated by the Ministers (for example, those rents which varied most up on down from gross value) so that urgent cases should be dealt with first. TheCommittee estimated that 198 Tribunals would be required for England and wales and 30 for Scotland. In Scotland rateable, values are based on the rent paid and while there is some unevenness in rents it is probably much less than in England.7. Tribunals have already been established to fix reasonable rents for lettings,without limit of rateable value, where furniture or services are provided; and also for unfurnished houses within the rent control limits let for the first time since 1st September, 1939. There are 80 such Tribunals in England and Wales and 30 inScotland, the great majority of which require only part service of their members.  J;8. It is clear that what the Committee had in mind was a levelling out of the rents of similar houses by reference to the general level of actual controlled rentsfor the well-kept houses and that they were not contemplating that Rent Tribunalsshould make any general increases in rent. - - -9. The Committee rejected the case for an immediate increase in rents for repairs, but they recommended that after Tribunals had brought rents to a fair level-they suggested at the end of three years from their appointment a technical committee should be appointed to report on the one question of the cost of repairs.The Committee were, of course, reporting in the light of the conditions prevailing at the time of their Report. Since the war, however, building costs have increasedenormously. If any Bill for the amendment of the Rent Restrictions Acts is intro-duced there will be strong pressure for an all-round increase of rents because of thegeneral increase in the cost of living and because of the great increase in the cost of repairs. The claim on the first of these grounds can and should be resisted, but itwill be difficult to withstand a claim for some increase in rent, where repairs are actually carried out, which would be related to the excess cost of those repairscompared with what a good landlord would normally have expected to bear pre-war. Owing to the incidence of owner&apos;s rates and the generally lower level of rents prevailing in 1914, owners of houses in Scotland are probably in a worse position than owners of comparable property in England and Wales. In manycases repairs are only being carried out where the local authority serves a noticerequiring repairs. The Scottish Property Owners&apos; Association estimate that in glasgow 30,000 controlled houses are showing a loss every year.Increased cost of services10. Where the provision of services, such as porterage, cleaning,- hot water,central heating, &amp;c, in accordance,with the standard agreed between landlord and:tenant involves the landlord in greater expenditure than he had to incur before thewar he should be entitled, the Committee recommended, to an increase in rent.In the Committee&apos;s view the Tribunals should; give a. high priority to applicationsof this kind. .   pEnforcement of repairs11. The 40 per cent, increase authorised by the Act of 1920 can be withheld if;the house is in any respect unfit for habitation or is not kept in a reasonable stateof repair, but there is no corrs spending provision authorising a deduction from the rent of new controlled houses (those brought in by the Act of 1939). The committee recommended that the same percentage, deduction should be allowed from the rent,of all houses and should be 30 per cent, of the registered rent. We feel that inpresent conditions such a requirement could hardly be contemplated in the absenceof some allowance for increased rent for cost of repairs.Men employed or to be employed in agriculture or rural industries12.   The Committee regarded the present power of the Court to grant an order&apos;on a certificate of the County Agricultural Committee as adequate so far as
agricultural workers are concerned, but received evidence that houses intended forand formerly occupied by rural workers were now occupied by Other persons to the detriment of rural industries. They recommended that on the application of an owner who became the owner before 1st September, 1939, the County agricultural committee should have power to grant a certificate on the ground that the person for whose occupation the house is required is, or will be, engaged in some occupationessential to the wellbeing of the rural community and that it is necessary for himto live in that area. On the production of such a certificate the County Court shouldhave power to grant an order, subject to reasonableness and &quot; greater hardship.&quot;13. Two of the Labour Members of the Committee, however, while agreeingwith the majority that there should be no change in the law so far as servicehouses owned by local authorities, railway companies and other employers areconcerned differed fundamentally on agricultural cottages on which the NationalUnion of Agricultural Workers had made strong representations. These two members recommended that all such cottages should be brought within the scopeof the Acts except those required for men in charge of stock to which the present law should continue to apply. - -14. The National Union of Agricultural Workers have continued to makestrong representations on the question of the agricultural tied cottage and theGovernment have promised to legislate on it when the time is convenient.Houses on Crown Lands15. This question was not dealt with by the Ridley Committee but could notbe ignored in any consideration of the review of the Rent Restrictions Acts. these have been held not to apply to such houses and, so far as houses directly managed by the Commissioners of Crown Lands are concerned, no harm is done since theCommisioners act as if they are bound. There are. however, a considerable numberof houses, about 7,000, in different parts of the country which have been erected on building leases from the Crown, some of the owners of which have tended to takeadvantage of their fortuitous position by attempting to evict the tenants with a viewto making a profit on sale. It has been possible, to a certain extent, to curb these activities by delegation of requisitioning powers to local authorities but this is nota satisfactory solution since there is no guarantee that all cases will come to thenotice of the authorities. The only satisfactory solution is to bring these houseswithin the scope of the Acts....Sub-let parts of large houses16. Until recently it w;as thought that, where a part of a house outside therateable value limits of the Rent Restrictions Acts was sub-let and the apportionedrateable value of the part was within the Rent Restrictions Acts limits, the Actsapplied to that part. It has been held in the Courts, however, that this is not so,and the tenants in such cases have therefore no protection against eviction or against exorbitant increases in rent. There are large numbers of persons in this position, particularly in the large towns, and there is need for amendment ofthe law to protect them.Tenants of leasehold houses17. The Rent Restrictions Acts do not apply to a tenancy of a house at a rentless than two-thirds of the rateable value, but it was thought that if the house weresub-let at a rent greater than two-thirds of the rateable value at the time when the tenancy came to an end (e.g., when a building lease falls in) the sub-tenant becamethe tenant of the superior landlord and was protected by the Acts. The Courts,however, have held (Knightsbridge Estates v. Deeley 1950) that the sub-tenant is notprotected by the Acts on the expiration of the tenancy. One of the effects of the leasehold Bill, as now proposed, will be to protect such a sub-tenant for twoyears where the expiring tenancy was for a period of 21 years or more. any measure amending the Rent Restrictions Acts should include a. more permanentprovision.Scottish Special Housing Association18. The Association is financed by the Secretary of State and is empoweredto erect houses for the general population in areas where housing needs aregreatest. The houses remain in the ownership of the Association and are managedeither by the local authorities on a commission basis or directly by the Association.
Tenants for the houses are nominated by the local authorities or in the case oftransferred miners by the National Coal Board. The Association^ houses are atpresent subject to the Rent Restrictions Acts. The Treasury are anxious that theAssociation should be put in the same position as local authorities and their housestaken outside the scope of the Acts so as to secure complete flexibility in the fixing of rents. A comprehensive rent control Act would provide a suitable opportunityfor doing this.Owner&apos;s rates in Scotland19. In England and Wales rates are levied in general on the occupier of thepremises, but it is understood that in the case of certain smaller houses the rates are paid by the landlord. In Scotland separate rates are levied on the owner andthe occupier. Under the 1920 Act, landlords in England and Wales were allowedto pass on to the tenant any increase since 1914 in rates payable by them but, inthe case of owner&apos;s rates in Scotland, landlords were permitted to pass on onlyany increase that occurred between 1914 and 1920.20. The Ridley Committee agreed that many Scottish owners were at a financial disadvantage in this respect as compared with owners in England andWales, but for various reasons they did hot feel justified in making any recom-mendation on the matter. If the Rent Restrictions Acts are to be amended strong pressure may be expected for the inclusion of a provision enabling Scottish owners to recover from tenants increases in owner&apos;s rates since 1920.Summary -21. If a Bill for the amendment of the Rent Restrictions Acts is to be infro-duced it will be necessary to decide which of the following matters are to be dealtwith:  ...(a) Replacement of the eleven existing Acts by one comprehensive measure.(b) Extension of the scope of the Acts to large houses, i.e., houses of rateable value exceeding  100 in London,  75 in the Provinces and  90 inScotland.(c) Registration by local authorities of the rents of all houses within the scopeof the acts.(d) Appointment of Rent Tribunals to review all existing rents with the objectof fixing fair rents having regard to the general level of controlled rents,i.e., evening out inequalities in existing rents.(e) Increases in rents to take account of increased cost of repairs and services.(/) Extension of the protection of the Acts to all agricultural cottages, except those required for men in charge of stock.(g) Extension of the protection of the Acts to the tenants of leasehold houseswhere the Crown is the ground landlord, to the tenants of parts of large,houses (if the large houses themselves are not brought within the scopeof the Acts) and to the tenants of leasehold houses on the expiry ofthe building lease.(h) Exclusion of houses of the Scottish Housing Association from the scopeof the Acts.22. The question for immediate decision, however, is whether a comprehensiveBill on the subject should be introduced in the lifetime of this Parliament, and if sowhether a statement of that intention should be made on the Second Reading of the leasehold (Temporary Provisions) Bill.A. B.H. McN.\5th November, 1950.
