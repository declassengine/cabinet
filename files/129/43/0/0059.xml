(50) 19th Meeting, Minute 4), invited me to submit to the Cabinet the questionof extending summer time in 1951.2. Under the Summer Time Act, 1947, the commencement and terminationof summer time may be fixed annually by Order in Council. If an Order in councils not made, the dates of summer time are determined by the Summer Time Acts,1922 and 1925; under this procedure summer time would &quot;in 1951. begin on22nd April and end on 7th October.. 3. In view of the serious and worsening fuel position, the Ministry of Fuel and power and the Central Economic Planning Staff have represented very strongly that summer time should be prolonged next year and should extend from18th March to 28th October. This is a period eight. weeks longer than that laiddown in the Statutes of 1922 and 1925. They also pressed for the introduction of double summer time for the months of May to August. They argued that a shorter period Would be of little use since it is only in the months when the sun setsrelatively early (May and August) that further saving will result. Because the extrasaving resulting from an extension of single summer time would fall within thecoal winter which ends on 30th April, and thus lessen the deficit on the winter coalbudget, they would regard this extension as slightly more important than the intro-duction of double summer time, if a choice had to be made; They urged, however,that the longer-term position is so alarming that there is every justification for taking both steps. Moreover, in the view of the Foreign Office, steps currently being taken to cut severely our exports of coal to other European countries wouldbe politically more defensible if we could be seen to be taking some uncomfortablemeasures to meet the situation ourselves. At a time.when we are urging the UnitedStates to reduce their domestic demands for certain raw materials for the sake ofthe European economies, this was in their view a point of some significance.     . r14. As to the choice between extended summer time and double summer tirrie&apos;,the Ministry of Fuel and Power argued that it was better to be &quot; hanged for a sheepthan a lamb.&apos;?.^On the other hand it would be hard to justify publicly distinguishing between the two. In each case the choice had to be made between a possible injury to the farmers (who are opposed to extending single summer time and implacablein resisting double summer time) and the urgent need to save fuel. In each casethe choice should be the same as it was in 1947, when the fuel outlook was, if anything, less menacing than it was to-day. According to revised estimates whichhad just been received, the saving of coal by prolonging summer,time would beVabout100,000 tons. An additional 25,000 tons would be saved.by&apos;;double sunimer time.In the extremely difficult coal situation, these savings would be of real significance.Particular importance was attached by the Ministry of Fuel and Power to extendingsummer time and, though the special force of the objection to double summer time was fully appreciated, the contribution to coal supplies which it would make was such that it was hoped that it would be possible to agree to both measures.39775Copy No.32
5. The Minists^Qdf-i^griesiltTIre .^^^^^^11^^^8001^ Office fully appreciate the need to save coal but do not believe that the savings calculated tobe made by the Ministry of Fuel and Power proposals can offset the serious location caused to agriculture by the extension of summer time or the intro-4aetk*p;)0jf double summer time. They would prefer that for nexti^ri*MMM^4ti?19should run for the statutory period laid down in the Summer Time-AetsrF932-&quot;arid1925 (22nd April to 7th October). They strongly opposed the ir^^du^on^double summer time. Farming interests felt strongly that the position would&quot; riotbe satisfactory for the best working of the industry unless anA&apos;Mhtil iwfe^teBaob lothe statutory period. The broad grounds of objection to summer time and double summer time, and particularly near the beginning and end of summer time, were that farm people were brought to work before the physical conditions for most fieldoperations were right. Valuable time was, therefore, wasted. Dairy farmers hada very special practical difficulty of their own. The agricultural industry was.working hard and was well on the way to achieving the whole of its expansion programme. It had been set the difficult task of reaching and maintaining newhigh levels of production. Any addition to the 1950 period of summer time wouldbe very discouraging to farmers, while any revival of double lurnmer time would beregarded as evidence- of &quot;indifference on the part of the1 Government to a need fora full productive effort. It was never possible fully to convince farmers, even under war ccmditionsjjthatithe; inconvenience suffered - by them,,&apos;espeeiaUf in the - dairyingsectionpLtheoiridustryg was: sufficiently taken, into, account when summer timeartddouble summer time were under consideration.. Nevertheless,, in the/Speciallydifficult coal situation the Ministers would be, prepared to, agree thatthe period Of. summer time in 1951 should be the same as-that in 1950, and extendfrom 15th April .tp 21.st October (i.e., a three weeks&apos; extension instead Of the eight weeks&apos;.asked by the Ministry of Fuel and Power). .They were vigorouslyopposed to any extension beyond this and to any consideration of double summertime. The most difficult part of the four-year programme for agricultural expansionwas approaching; ;?Thelproposed extension of summer time and the introduction of double summer time would have serious consequences for the agricultural industryand.would-result m- - aiconsiderable loss in output. The Secretary of State has emphasised that the difficulties for agriculture would be especially-acute in Scotland.6. When&apos; double summer time was last in operation^ the Prime , Minister,accompanied by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the then Secretary ofState for Scotland and myself, received a deputation from the Scottish farmers, whopointed out most convincingly the grave difficulties confronting^ them through tfieconditions it created. Their point of view was accepted by the Ministers whosaw them;&apos; &apos;&quot; &apos;. : &apos; i&apos;.&apos;&quot;.     &apos;Z,... 7. had hoped that in 1951 we could revert to the statutory period, but, inall the circumstances and with great reluctance, I thought fit to suggest to the lord president&apos;? Committee that, in view of the representations made by the fuel interestsdp the gravity of the, coal situation and the requirements for rearmament, the periodof summer time in 1951,should begin on 18th March and terminate on 28th october and that there should be no period of double summer time; ,;- --8i The;Lord-President&apos;s Committee agreed that double suipmer time shouldnot be introduced ih: 1951. In view of the sharp division of opinion between theMinister of. Fuel -and; Power and the Agricultural Ministers on the question of extending summer time, the Committee decided that the matter should be referredto the Cabinet for decision against the background of other measures for dealingwith the coal situation: &apos;     : - - .
