THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. November 1950SECRET \:. copy no.32C;P. (50) 2543rd November, 1950CABINETCOAL SUPPLIES: OUTLOOK FOR THE PERIOD 1951-1955POSSIBLE METHODS OF INCREASING PRODUCTIONMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power in the first part of this paper I give a summary of the conclusions which I havereached in regard to the outlook for coal supplies in the period 1951-55. Theoutlook disclosed is extremely disturbing. In the second part, I describe themeasures already taken by the National Coal Board to increase production, andof which, therefore, account has already been taken in the present forecasts. I alsodescribe certain other measures which might be taken to relieve the situation inthe later part of the period, either by increasing production, or by reducing inlandconsumption.A. The Present Outlook for the Five-Year Period 1951-552. The following table gives my estimate of coal production, inland consump-tion and export availability for the next five years. The National Coal Board agreewith this estimate.Outlook for Coal Supplies 1951-55		Million	Tons		Export 1	Deep-mined		Total	Inland	Bunker	Production	Opencast	Supplies	Consumption Availability	1951	208 0	12 0	220 0	206-0	14-01952	212-0	10 0	222-0	210-0	1201953	215-5	9 0	224-5	212-5	12-01954	218-0	4-0	222-0	214 0	8-0*1955	221-0	2 0	223-0	215-5	7-5*3.   Deep-mined production. The present forecasts assume (a) that there will be a substantial increase in output per man shift at the face(an average of 4 per cent, per annum);(b) that attendance will be maintained at the present level; but(c) that there will be an average annual fall of 6,000 face workers (as comparedwith the fall of 10,000 expected in 1950; this year the long-term down-ward trend has been aggravated by the removal of the &quot; ring-fence &quot; inJanuary last).This decline in man-power which I have allowed for is substantial; but it maywell exceed my estimate of 6,000 per annum, if the armament programme shouldrob the coal industry of recruits which it would otherwise have secured.. * These figures represent a level to which exports could not in practice drop without the closing of pits designed for the export trade.39593
2The estimates I have given also assume that the development work planned for the period by the Coal Board will continue. I consider this essential; for, ifWe tried to meet our present difficulties by curtailing development work, this short-sighted policy, aggravating the effects of the lack of investment during the war years, would soon bring a fall in output.&apos; The Coal Board engineers have to hold a careful balance, for, just as insufficientdevelopment must mean a loss of output later on, so too much development work could wreck our current prospects. - -:     .    I.4. The Board have, I think, held a reasonable balance in this matter and thepresent estimates are the best that can be expected. I should, however, make itclear that even these forecasts will not be secured if man-power continues to fallat the present rate and if output per man shift does not reach the level expected.5. Opencast. The estimates given are those already announced under theplan for allowing this type of coal mining to tail off rapidly after 1952.6. Inland consumption. The present estimates take account of the persistenttendency for inland consumption to rise, which has shown itself ever since theend of the war. This applies particularly to coal consumption by the power stations,gas works and general industry, whose net increase in consumption over 1949 isexpected this year to amount to 7 per cent., 4 per cent, and 4 per cent, respectively.Nevertheless, I have assumed a substantial decline in the annual rate of increasein coal consumption by the power stations, gas works and general industry. Asregards house coal, I have assumed that in five years&apos; time consumption will stillbe strictly curtailed, and that, supplies per head will be no greater than at present.7. Export I bunker availability: If we assume that essential inland require-ments are the first charge on our coal resources, the. availability for exports andbunkers will, as shown in the table, fall rapidly during the next five years. Even if in1951 availability is as high as 14 million tons (and on present performance a figureof 12-5 million tons is more probable) about 5 million tons has got to be set aside for bunkers and bunker depots abroad, leaving no more than 9 million tons forcargo exports. In following years its availability for cargo exports will be much less.It must be noted, however, that substantial quantities of coal now beingexported either consist of grades for which there is only a limited demand in the inland market, or are produced at pits in coastal areas from which only part of theproduction can be distributed to inland consumers by the railway system and coast-wise shipping. Taking these considerations together, it seems likely that 10 million tons a year or even more represents the minimum to which, save in crisis conditionssuch as obtained in 1947, exports and bunkers taken together can fall, if pits are notto be stopped for lack of trade. In a period of crisis, no doubt, inland purchaserscould be found for grades which are normally unacceptable at home, and are there-fore exported; but at other times it would be impossible to find inland purchasersfor these coals. ,  .  .:; -   &apos;&apos;:&apos; - &apos;vr,i,, &apos; &apos; &apos;-&quot;        ,. IB.-Possible Measures for Maintaining and Increasing Output or RedlJcingInland Consumption8. I turn now to consider possible measures for maintaining or increasing coal production, and for reducing inland consumption and so increasing the availabilityfor exports.     , s- - .       ,     Measures Affecting Coal Production9. Measures in hand. The following measures have already been taken bythe National Coal Board for the purpose of increasing production.(a) Machinery and equipment. New machinery is being introduced by theBoard as quickly as possible in order to raise output per man-shift.(b) Man-power. The shortage of man-power is becoming serious in Yorkshire,West Midlands, South Wales, and the Scottish and North-WesternDivisions. Special studies are being made by the Board for the purposeof ascertaining the cause of wastage in these Divisions.
(c) Import of Italian labour.- -This is being discussed between the Board andthe National Union of Mineworkers. The difficulties (language, socialfrictions, billeting, &amp;c.j are substantial/ Even if the scheme is acceptedby the Union, difficulties in plating the men will certainly be&apos; encountered, at the Lodges. This is a matter where my mining colleagues may be ableto help.(d) A bsenteeism.-Although the average level of attendance is; hot unsatis-&apos;    -        factory? there are certain areas and certain pits&apos;; with very highabsenteeism. The Board are intensifying their efforts to ascertain thecause of the trouble in these areas and pits with a view to takingremedial action.(e) Incentive schemes. The Board are considering the possibility of intro-ducing schemes to provide an incentive for good attendance and highindividual output.if) Housing. Lack of houses at key villages is regarded by the Board as the major cause of the difficulty in maintaining manpower and deployingit to increase output. It is estimated that 20,000 extra houses are needed by 1955. Within the limits of existing policy the Minister of Healthhas been extremely helpful, but in view of the extreme importance attached to this question by the Board, I would ask for considerationof the adoption of &quot; emergency measures.&quot;10. Further measures. The following is a list of further measures whicheither are being considered or should, I recommend, be urgently considered. (a) Supplementary Pensions Scheme. I believe that a supplementary pensions scheme might be of great value for checking wastage in the higherage-groups. Such a scheme should be introduced at the earliest moment that the general economic situation permits; in the meantime. Depart-ments should be asked to press on with their studies of the issues involved in such schemes, so that, when opportunity offers, a scheme can be introduced with the minimum of delay.(b) Additional coal-cutting machinery of British manufacture.-! am discussingurgently with the Board the possibility of expediting the programme for introducing the new Samson Stripper machine; if this is found to be practicable, immediate action will be needed to increase the capacityrequired for the manufacture of these machines.(c) Import of American mining machinery. I am considering with the board the possibility of accelerating major roadway development undergroundby the adaptation of the American machine known as the Joy Con-tinuous Miner. If this were found to be practicable, it might bedesirable to import more of these machines.(d) Washeries and preparation plant. I consider that there is room for con-siderable additional investment here; for 65 million tons are still pickedby hand each year. Increased mechanisation should release some man-power for employment underground.C. Measures for Checking the Growth of Inland Consumption11. Measures already in hand-Tht estimates of inland consumption now submitted take account of the savings likely to be secured during the period by (a) the introduction of methods for the more efficient use of coal, by a develop-ment of the existing arrangements for stoker demonstration;(b) the substitution, wherever opportunity offers, of an improved openablestove for the present household grate;(c) the promotion of measures for the insulation of houses and other buildings.12. Possible long-term savings. There are various possible measures forsaving coal in the long term, the examination of which should, I suggest, be pushedon with as rapidly as possible:  (a) Improvements in the use of coal by railways offer a valuable field for coal savings; the existing Working Party should be urged to completeits investigation as quickly as possible.
(b) The use of briquettes made from small coal and of a type free from theobjections raised by the Railway Unions Would offer substantial economies. The existing experiments should be prosecutea with theutmost vigour, as also should be arrangements for the plant needed for briquette production.(c) A substantial reduction in colliery consumption of coal has already been effected. There are, however, certain longer-term possibilities for increasing savings under this head; these are being examined by theBoard.D. Opencast Coal13. The present policy of the Government is to allow opencast production to start falling in 1952 and virtually to disappear by 1955. This process could be partially checked, if we were to revise our present attitude towards the farmers andthe countryside and on dollars and costs. No appreciable help in 1951 could,however, be looked for under this head. On the other hand, if a fall in 1952 is tobe prevented, authority should at once be given to arrange for the purchase of thenecessary equipment in the United States, the only country in which suitable types of machinery&apos;are produced in any appreciable quantity.E-Fuel oil the outlook for oil supplies is not such as would justify the launching of anew campaign in favour of conversion from coal to oil. On the other hand, it isdesirable that steps should now be taken, in agreement with the British oil industry,to withdraw as rapidly as can be arranged the existing restrictions in the use of oil in place of solid fuel.P.
