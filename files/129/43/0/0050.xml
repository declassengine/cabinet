THIS   DOCUMENT IS THE   PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1950SECRET    , .:r &apos;  Copy Nq,32CP: (50) 3004//i December, 1950 ,    , ..... ,CABINETACTION BY DURHAM COUNTY COUNCIL IN REGARD TO,MEMBERSHIP OF TRADE unions is a  ^ ^Memorandum by the Attorney-GeneralMy colleagues may care to have a note of the legal position in connection withthe action taken by the Durham County Council.2. According to the Manchester Guardian of 16th November the Clerk tothe Council has sent to all members of the staff a letter in the following terms:  &quot; At a meeting of the county council of 1st November it was decided thatall members of the staff should be members of an appropriate trade union.I should be obliged, therefore, if you will supply me with evidence of membership on or before 22nd November, 1950. If not a member of a tradeunion please acknowledge receipt of this letter. If evidence of membership ofa trade union is not produced by this date, appropriate notice will be givento all those persons in the employment of the county council who are not members of a trade union to terminate their employment and, at the sametime, persons concerned will be offered re-employment on the existing terms with the overriding condition they become members of a trade union before being re-engaged.&quot;3. All Ministers concerned with the activities of Local Authorities have considerable powers in the event of a Council defaulting in the exercise of its functions. Thus under the Public Health Act, 1936, the Minister of Health can,after a local enquiry, transfer the powers of a defaulting Council to some other body or to himself (ss. 322/325). Similar powers arise under the National health service, the Town Planning and the Education Acts.4. There must, however, be a default in the sense of a failure to discharge their duties. It is possible that the Durham County Council might be ablesufficiently to implement their threatened policy to enable them to continue in thedischarge of their duties, in which case the default powers would not arise.5. There are also certain powers of financial control. Thus under the LocalGovernment Act, 1948, the Minister has power to reduce the Exchequer grant butonly if he is satisfied that the Council &quot; have failed to maintain a reasonable standardof efficiency and progress in the discharge of their functions.&quot; I feel most doubtfulwhether the present case really comes within these words. No doubt, however,Ministers by threatening to withhold financial assistance and by other indirectmethods could exercise much influence.6. The powers possessed by the Minister of Education are, however, much wider. He can not only act on default but can control the exercise by local Educa-tion Authorities of their discretionary powers, and can issue directions if he thinksthey are acting unreasonably. I have already advised the Minister on these powersarising under Section 68 of the Education Act, 1944. I have no doubt that he wouldbe entitled to regard the letter referred to in paragraph 2 as an attempt to introducean unreasonable condition of employment and as itself containing an unreasonablethreat of dismissal.39727
7. I must, however, add that, if the facts are as they appear, it is clear thatthe Durham County CbhncuVShPuid they Mrrybut^theiS&apos;threat of dismissal, willbe conducting a lock-out in connection with a trade dispute and in contravention of order No. 1305. In view of the issues of personal liberty involved I could hardlyneglect to take proceedings if this situation should unhappily arise. Indeed, it maywell be that the Local Authority have already committed an offence, punishableunder Article 90 of the Defence (General) Regulations in that their letter constitutesan act preparatory to a lock-out.8. I hope that my colleagues will agree that the responsibility should not be thrown upon me to take action in this matter by means of the criminal law and thatadministrative or political steps will be taken to avoid any lock-out in advance.H. W. S.Royal Courts of Justice^ W.C. 2,4th December, 1950.
