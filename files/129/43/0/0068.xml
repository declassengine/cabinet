(50) 31821st DecernpeK, 1950CABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATY:  SECURITY ASPECTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister of DefenceWe circulate herevyith to our colleagues a report prepared by the Chiefs ofStaff as the basis for an agreed Commonwealth military policy on the formJapanese rearmament should take after the signing of a Japanese Peace Treaty.2. This paper was prepared by the Chiefs of Staff for use in discussions withthe United States Government on the subject of a Japanese Peace Treaty. Indealing with this question from the point of view of general policy, the report hastaken into account the preliminary views of the United States and of the Common-wealth, though it has not been related specifically to the latest events in the far east. In submitting this report the Chiefs of Staff gave it as their view that theeffect of recent events in the Far East was:(a) to underline further the necessity for Japanese rearmament in the future;(b) to render it essential, in connection with the conclusion of a Peace Treaty,that some arrangement be made so that the United States Forces do not actually leave Japan until sufficient Japanese forces are available toensure the security of Japan in the event of Pviissian aggression.3. In paragraph 13 of the report, the Chiefs of Staff state that &quot; in consider-ing any peace treaty (with Japan), however, account must be taken of the reper-cussions on the German situation.&quot; On this point developments now contemplatedfor the Federal Republic, though they cannot be presented in the form of a peace treaty because of the division of Germany, are nevertheless designed to providethe Federal Republic with a political and military status in Western Europe whichshould prove as acceptable to the Germans as a non-restrictive peace treaty will beto the Japanese. Provided that our German policy continues successfully on itspresent lines there would appear to be no cause for concern about the repercussions in Germany of an ostensibly more favourable policy vis-a-vis Japan.4. We agree both with the views expressed by the Chiefs of Staff as set outin the attached report and also with the further observations outlined in para-graph 2 above, and we invite our colleagues to concur in the conclusions set optin paragraphs 20-23 inclusive in the report from the Chiefs of Staff.5. Subject to the concurrence of our colleagues it is proposed that this report and its conclusions should be used as the basis for instructions to His Majesty&apos;representatives for the purposes of the peace treaty negotiations and also for thepurposes of a paper which will be tabled at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Conference.E.

annex report of the Chiefs of Staff on the Rearmament of Japan(C.O.S. (50) 516)background. Previous Views. We have given our preliminary views on japanese rearmament in an examination of the defence aspects of a Japanese Peace Treaty,prior to the Colombo Conference of January 1950 (S.A.C. (49) 19). At that timethe Commonwealth and United States views were not known.2.   Present Position (a) Informal discussions on a Japanese Peace Treaty have been going on in new York between the United States and other interested parties,including Russia and the Commonwealth countries, since Septem-ber 1950.(b) Commonwealth and United States Views.-The provisional views of individual Commonwealth countries, at official level, on a japanese peace Treaty and on the rearmament of Japan are contained in thereport of the Commonwealth Working Party which met in May 1950(CiV (50) 160); an edited version of this report was handed to theUnited States Government on 22nd September, 1950, in reply to a brief note on United States provisional ideas. The latter was also com-municated to all countries of the Far Eastern Commission and hasnow been published by the United States, whose hand has been forcedby a breach of confidence on the part of Russia.The report shows that there is agreement between the Common-wealth and United States on the need to end the state of war with japan by means of a Peace Treaty. /The United Kingdom and the United States have both accepted in principle the need to rearm Japan to a limited extent. It appearslikely that this need may also be recognised by the other Common-wealth countries, though raising of Japanese forces may be unwelcome to some of them.The Commonwealth countries envisage the conclusion of a separateDefence Pact concurrently with the Peace Treaty (paragraphs 15and 16).(c) United Kingdom Views-The United Kingdom general political views are: -(i) That it is urgent to conclude a Peace Treaty before concessions which it might confer have already by force of circumstancesbecome accomplished facts;(ii) That a single Commonwealth Policy should be formulated.(iii) That the Commonwealth Policy should as quickly as possible bemade known informally to the Americans before the latter are committed to a policy.It is also intended that the subject of a Japanese Peace Treaty and japanese rearmament should be discussed at the forthcoming meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers.Aim3. The aim of this paper is to provide the Foreign Office with a basis for an agreed Commonwealth Military Policy for discussion with America when considering what form Japanese rearmament should take after the signing of a peace Treaty.Method of Examination4. We have first examined the general military considerations relating to japanese rearmament. We have then examined the American and Commonwealthproposals in the light of these military considerations. As a result we have concluded how, from the military point of view, Japanese rearmament should beachieved once the peace treaty has been signed, and the general form it should take.
Military ConsiderationsGeneral5. An approach to the problem of Japanese rearmament must be based on thefollowing factors:  (a) Within the next few years(i) Japan has not the military means or economic resources to becomeby herself an aggressor. - &quot;     ;1.(ii) Military arrangements are necessary for internal security and against&apos; external threats. - .(iii) Military arrangements must be sponsored and economic help mustbe provided by the Allies to prevent Japan from falling a prey toCommunism.(b) Long Term(i) Permanent restrictions on rearmament can only be imposed bypermanent occupation; this is politically impracticable andmilitarily unacceptable. Therefore Japan must become anindependent sovereign Power.(ii) The continued alignment of Japan with the West can only beachieved on a voluntary basis, which would mean the establish-ment of an identity of interest politically, economically andmilitarily.Threats to Allied Security6. Communist Threat. The main threats to Allied security in the Far Eastin the period for which it is possible to plan are from Communism:  (a) In Peace.-Japan is a major East Asian objective of Russian imperialism.The most effective medium which Russia can use to achieve her aim isthat of international Communism, the formidable exponent of which; in the Far East is Communist China. There is already a CommunistParty of some strength in Japan; an Allied withdrawal would greatlyfacilitate Communist infiltration into Japanese life.(b) In War.-In the event of war, it has been estimated that there will be anexternal threat to Japan from Russia, regardless of any assistance to thelatter from Communist China.We consider that if Japan is to be kept in the Allied camp her internal securitymust be assured both in peace and war and she must be protected from the externalthreat in war; there must be no &quot; power vacuum &quot; in Japan after the signing of a japanese Peace Treaty.7. Japanese Threat. Japan is a highly-populated country with considerableindustrial resources arid capability. In the long term her desire to establish herindustrial prominence and her necessity to expand either territorially or economic-ally must be appreciated. This economic fact will inevitably provide a motive forJapanese military aggression which cannot be disregarded in considering our generalpolicy towards Japan in the post-peace period.8. In the short term, Japan is not capable of military aggression. Japan hasnot the indigenous resources necessary to support her own economy, let alone toback an aggressive policy. Her military successes in 1942 depended on the exploita-tioh of raw materials of the Asiatic Mainland and to the considerable stockpilingthat she had achieved. She is, in fact, dependent on the Asiatic Mainland and Othercountries for the supply of the vast majority of her raw materials. Thus, Japan in isolation does not represent a military threat. Should she become a party to anycombination of Powers in the Far East, such as is now represented by the Com-muriist&apos; bloc, she might develop sufficient strength to threaten Allied territoriesthroughout the Pacific and Far East (D.O. (50) 45).In the long term, she will only be capable of conducting an aggressive war if she possesses major naval forces and has secured the necessary economic resources.Allied Strategy9. In Peace. Allied strategy in peace in the Far East, as elsewhere, is to oppose the spread of Communism and in particular to deny the resources of japan to Communism. - o39822 b 2
10.  In War. The North Pacific is an. American zone of responsibility.Allied strategy in war is to secure Japan and the Ryukyus; to use Okinawa as abase for the strategic air offensive; to maintain sea and air lines of communication;to deny the China Seas to the enemy; to adopt a defensive land strategy with .minimum forces so as to deploy maximum forces elsewhere.- - .-11. The requirements of Allied strategy will to a certain extent be met bythe United States trusteeship of the Ryukyus and Bonin Islands, but forces willbe required in Japan for, internal security and defence against external threat.Taking into account all the other commitments of the Allies, it is evident that they;cannot provide these forces unaided. For this reason and because, as an inde-pendent nation, Japan must take an active part in her own defence, she should provide the necessary forces.12. Type of Japanese Armed Forces. In the light of the above we considerthat Japan should provide conventional armed forces with the exception of majornaval forces, strategic bombing forces and special weapons which would be pro-vided by the Americans in accordance with Allied strategy and would not berequired by Japan. Her forces, which should be of a size suitable to carry outher obligations for internal security and defence, would therefore consist of:  (a) Naval vessels up to frigates, excluding submarines;(b) Balanced land forces;(c) Balanced air forces, except strategic bombing forces.Instrument for Effecting Japanese Rearmament .        .   ,   ...13. The United States had proposed a few months ago a Peace Treatyrestoring full Japanese sovereignty. In considering any Peace Treaty, however,account must be taken of the repercussions on the German situation.14. We agree with the Commonwealth political view given in paragraph 2 (b)above that there, should be a Defence Pact separate from the Peace Treaty, since (i) It will thereby be possible to restrict the signatories to friendly Powers;(ii) The Defence Pact can be voluntarily agreed to by Japan after hersovereignty has been restored by the Peace Treaty;(iii) It is the only method we can see whereby some safeguards can beprovided.15. A Regional Defence Pact covering the Pacific and South-East Asia would satisfy Australian and New Zealand demands for security, would permit collectiveaction in peace and would enable Allied forces to be deployed in accordance withAllied grand strategy in war; a regional defence pact should therefore be themilitary aim. The attitude of the Asian Powers towards the Western Powers and american fears of a charge of imperialism are such that a regional pact is atpresent politically impracticable and must remain a long-term policy.16. Bilateral or Multilateral Defence Pact with Japan. A multilateral pactwould imply that all signatories were jointly responsible for the security of Japan.;The United States is the only country who can provide military aid for Japan, hencea multilateral pact would not make military sense. Militarily, therefore, the pactshould be bilateral.We know that the United States is anxious to avoid the charge of imperialismwhich she might incur through a bilateral Defence Pact. She would probably prefer,a defence pact which was multilateral at least in name. If such a pact providedthat the United States would supply all the military aid needed to implement it,we should have no military objection.17.   We therefore consider that (a) A Regional Defence Pact is not at present practicable but from the military point of view it should be the long-term objective.(b) Militarily a bilateral Defence Pact would be the best solution, but inconsideration of United States views we may have to accept a multi-lateral pact.Restrictive Clauses and Controls18.   In pursuance of the need for a liberal treaty it is undesirable, if not impossible, to impose or to suggest that Japan agree to detailed defence restrictions;
and a concomitant inspectorate. It will therefore not be practicable to includerestrictive clauses in the Defence Pact.We consider that Japan would agree both on military and economic grounds to certain forces and weapons as in paragraph 12 above being provided by theAllies. We consider, disregarding political and economic considerations, that the possession and building of merchant fleets and civil air fleets cannot be denied to japan on purely strategic grounds.No firm military safeguard limiting Japan&apos;s capability for aggression in thefuture is practicable. The only means of achieving any restrictions are:  (a) Japan&apos;s voluntary acceptance of the provision of certain forces and weaponsby the Allies for her defence and the restrictive influence of the presenceof these forces in Japan. This is in fact our only safeguard.(b) To a limited extent by the exploitation of Japan&apos;s economic dependence on the Allies.Conclusions19.   We conclude that:  (a) Japan in isolation does not represent a military threat.(b) The threat from Japan lies in the danger of her joining an unfriendly Asiaticor Communist bloc.(c) Allied Forces should not be withdrawn from Japan until Japan is capableof undertaking her own defence.(d) A regional Defence Pact is not at present practicable, but from themilitary point of view it should be the long-term objective.(e) Militarily a bilateral Defence Pact would be the best solution, but inconsideration of United States views we may have to accept a multi-lateral Pact.20. Safeguards against Japanese Aggression. No firm military safeguardlimiting Japan&apos;s capability for aggression in the future is practicable. The only means of achieving any restrictions are:  (a) Japan&apos;s voluntary acceptance of the provision of major naval forces,strategic bombing forces and special weapons by the Allies for herdefence and the restrictive influence of those forces in Japan;(b) To a limited extent by the exploitation of Japan&apos;s economic dependence onthe Allies.21. United Slates Proposals. The proposals put forward by the United states as a basis for the Peace Treaty are satisfactory from the military point of view, onthe assumption that the Treaty will be followed by a bilateral Defence Pact.22. Commonwealth Views. The provisional views of the commonwealth countries show that the only major point of difference, as compared with our policyexpressed in this report, is New Zealand&apos;s view that total prohibition of japanese rearmament should be enforced. We have shown that this is an unrealistic attitude and is moreover inconsistent with the general Commonwealth agreement on theliberal nature of a Japanese Peace Treaty.23. Type of Japanese Armed Forces. Japan should be permitted forces ofa size suitable to carry out her obligations for internal security and defence. Theyshould consist of:  (a) Naval vessels up to frigates, excluding submarines;(b) Balanced land forces;(c) Balanced air forces, except strategic bombing forces.
