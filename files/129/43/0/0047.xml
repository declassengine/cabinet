secret.P..(50) 297 COPY NO. 321ST DECEMBER, 1950CABINETCOAL:   MAN-POWER FOR THE MINESMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power. I attach Reports from the Official Coal Committee on the following subjects:-(i)   Supplementary Pensions for Miners;(ii)   Man-power, recruitment and wastage in the coal-mining industry.I am afraid I am unable to accept in general the conclusions in these reports.2. I would like my colleagues first of all to consider our generalcoal situation as the background against which these various proposals must be judged.3. Unless output from the mines improves without delay we shall be faced with a coal crisis and the probable stoppage of industry after christmas.Unless present trends can be reversed we shall be faced with amuch worse crisis in the later part of 1951 and in succeeding years.This year we shall perhaps get a little more than 204 million tons.     If we goon falling 80,000 tons a week below the previous year&apos;s output, as we have donein recent weeks, we should get in 1951 about 200 million tons, which would leave nothing at all for cargo exports, and only barely enough for inlandconsumption:   and in 1952 the position would be still worse.4. It is impossible for the Government to accept such a development as this.     It would not only be fatal to the Labour Party, it would be fatal to the national interest as well.     Coal is, in the most literal sense, the foundation of defence.     It is the foundation of our economic prosperity.Nine-tenths of the power supplied to British industry comes from coal.Exports of coal have always been an important factor in our power to buy what we need abroad.     Nothing could so weaken the Foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade as a decline ixi coal output.Conversely, nothing could so much strengthen thern as an early and substantial increase.5. The major cause of our immediate troubles is the fall in therate of increase in output per man shift (about 2 per cent above thecorresponding period for 1949 instead of the 3, 5 per cent which had been expected).     This slackening in the rate of increase of output per man-shift would not have mattered if the man-power in the mines had beenHIS DOC UME-N-T - IS -T-HE PROPERTY -OF HIS britannic MA JEST YlS-GOVERNMENT)

maintained at a higher level.     The fall in man-power is at least inpart the cause of the slackening in the rate of increase of output permanshift.Since 21st January the net wastage from the mines has been22,800 men.     If we had retained these men we could have had perhapsnearly 208 million, tons instead of.204 million tons.     We could havefulfilled our export commitments and been better able to cope with any emergency this winter may bring.6. For 1951, I understand that a recent Ministry of Labourestimate is that there may be a further loss of 20,000 men (that is, bythe end of 1951, a decline in the total labour force to 665,000).     Wecannot possibly accept this, for it would mean a decline instead of anincrease in output and (bearing in mind the inevitable growth of inlandconsumption) a decline in exports from this year&apos;s figure of 17 million tons, to about 7 million tons.     More than half this latter figure wouldhave to go to ships1 bunkers, and with the remainder it would no longer be possible for this country to play any real part in the internationalcoal export trade.      Our minimum target for next year must be a labour force of not less than 705,000 men by the end of 1951;   an increaseof 20,000 men instead of a decrease.     This, together with some increased productivity, would give us a maximum export (including bunkers) for theyear of 12 million tons, little enough in all conscience, out of a total out-put of 210 million tons.7. I have no doubt that we can get the men, but it will need a tremendous effort.Over the year 1949 the wastage from the mines was 1,3 80 menper week.Recruitment was 1,000 men per week.If the wastage could be reduced to 1,000, and if recruitmentcould be increased to 1,500, there would be a net gain of 25,000 men inthe year.8. Can wastage be reduced?    I believe it can if the Cabinet will agree to two measures:-(a) If they will decide to take at this moment of grave industrialdanger the decisions about miners in the Armed Forces whichwere taken at moments of grave military danger in the twoWorld Wars.(b) If they will agree that the Coal Board shall negotiate withthe miners a system, of supplementary pensions.I have carefully considered the difficulties regarding theseproposals mentioned by the Official Coal Committee, but I feel that inthe present emergency these difficulties must be faced.9.     Service with the Forces.1 think it is essential to bring back to the pits as many aspossible of the miners who have recently joined, or been called up, tothe Forces.     This has been an important cause of wastage.     I have

not been able to obtain total figures for the country as a whole for thewhole of this year, but the following are the figures for the Yorkshirecoalfield: -Called up as reservists in 1950 249Gone as volunteers to join the Forces 639Called up for national service from 64surface work for which there is not,at present, exemption _____952This is nearly one quarter of the net wastage from the Yorkshirecoalfield in 1950, and, of course, most of the men who have gone are the strongest and most vigorous workers. /10. But the effect of this movement from the mines to the forces is not confined merely to the men who join up.     It creates the general impression that service in the mines is not of great national importance;it exercises some demoralising influence, especially when, as nowunfortunately often happens, the man-power in a pit is so much reducedthat men must be brought back from the face to work on haulage andother jobs behind.     I suggest accordingly that notwithstanding the diffi-culties set out by the Official Coal Committee in their Report we should now give instructions that:(a) recruiting for the Forces in mining areas should cease;(b) when miners volunteer the Recruiting Sergeant should urgeon them to stay in the pits;(c) volunteers who have joined this year should be urged toreturn to the pits;(d) reservists should be returned to the pits.It should, of course, be a condition that no man should bebrought back from the Forces unless he had a job in the mines to cometo.11.   Supplementary Pensions.The objections which have been raised to my proposals to approve a scheme of supplementary pensions are based upon the dangerof repercussions in other industries, and upon the fact that an enquiry is to be made into the economic and social implications of such schemes.So far as the repercussions upon other industries are concerned I would point out:(i) A perfectly clear distinction can and should be drawn between a scheme for a gravely undermanned industry, such as coal-mining/and one for the other socialised industries.

As long ago as 1938 the International Labour Office in a reporton &quot;The World Coal-Mining Industry&quot; made the case for an&quot;occupational&quot; pension scheme for miners to provide for their special needs.In other countries special schemes of this kind have long beenadopted, extending back to times when there was considerableunemployment.     On 1st January, 1947, occupational pension schemes for miners were in operation in Australia, Belgium,Czechoslovakia, France, Germany and Holland.This constitutes a readily comprehensible special case for dealingseparately with the coal industry, and for taking this step now.It is) in the nature of things, impossible to assess what concreteresults in retaining or recruiting men for the industry would accrue fromthis scheme.     But the Board consider that the results would be greaterthan those which could be expected from a further increase in the wages of the lower-paid workers;   and there is undoubtedly a large field - some25,000 - among those, aged 30 and over, who leave the industry of theirown volition and not under pressure of illness, injury, etc. , who wouldcertainly be affected in greater or less degree by the existence of apension scheme.In my view, this is one of the more hopeful means suggested for strengthening the man-power of the industry^     It would operate directlyon the most serious problem of the industry, that of a crippling rate of loss of trained man-power.     The men most likely to be affected at thebeginning are the most experienced of the miners of the industry,     Itwould have a beneficial effect on labour relations and morale;   it would meet one of the few remaining claims from the Miners1 Charter of 1946;and it would constitute an important concession to the miners, and would,at the same time, tend to have a disinflationary effect, except in the longrun.I only ask now that the Cabinet shall approve the principle thatthe National Coal Board should be informed that the Government areprepared to approve a scheme of supplementary pensions for miners.12.     Wages.There is much evidence that there is widespread discontent withthe award of the Porter Tribunal for a small increase of wages to thelower-paid workers.     There may well be claims put forward by theNational Union of Mineworkers.     If anything has to be done by theNational Coal Board, I feel clear that it ought to be on the basis of an incentive bonus linked to increased output,13.     Recruitment.(a)     The above measures would, I have no doubt, help considerably to check wastage.     They would also help to increase recruitment.     i feel sure that we now need a big organised campaign for recruits con-ducted by the Ministry of Labour and the National Coal Board togetherof the kind we had in 1947 and 1948, and I endorse the recommendations made by the Official Coal Committee on this matter.(iii)

(b) We should, of course, also require an increased publicity-campaign in the coalfields, and I hope that the recruiting campaign forthe Forces in mining areas would be stopped.     The purpose of the campaign would be to make every miner and every potential recruitfeel that service in the mines was the most important form of nationalservice which at the present time he can undertake.     This is, in fact,the truth.(c) Notwithstanding the difficulties foreseen by the Official coal committee, I think that young men should be given an opportunity to optfor two years&apos; employment in the mines as an alternative to militaryservice.     The advantages of a gain in man-power in 1951 and 1952would in my opinion outweigh the disadvantage of losses in 1953.     in allowing the same option to young men already in the mines it would not, ofcourse, be possible to allow them to count their previous service in the mines towards this two years;   and I do not agree that it would beimpossible for us to hold this line.(d) Something must be done to break the present stalemate on theemployment of Italian labour.     Rome Radio announced about a fortnightago that there were 15,000 ex-miners unemployed in Italy at the presenttime.     Clearly we must get as many of those Italians to our pits assoon as possible.     There is nothing officials can do in the way of starting up arrangements to bring any considerable number of them here and to have them taught English, unless and until we know that they willbe accepted, both by the National Union of Mineworkers at headquarters and by the Lodges at the pits.     Unfortunately, there is little sign atpresent that either condition will be fulfilled.     The attitude of the minersis giving rise to strongly unfavourable public comment, and the Govern-ment cannot allow matters to drift.     I would propose in these circum-stances to move along the following lines:-(i)     I propose that the Minister of Labour and I should see theNational Union of Mineworkers&apos;&apos; Executive privately in themiddle of next week, and should urge that they should with-draw their objection of principle to Italian workers, andshould allow the National Coal Board and the Ministry ofLabour to negotiate for local agreements in the areas orpits where labour is most needed and where Italians can be best fitted in.(ii)     I am meeting the Members of Parlia.ment for mining constituencies-uencies on Wednesday, 6th December.     I propose to explain the position to them and ask them in the week-end of 9thDecember to discuss the matter with the local miners&apos;leaders for the areas most likely to be asked to takeItalians.     I am asking the National Coal Board to providea list of them for our guidance, since it would&apos;be no userisking an upset by approaching other areas.I would hope that if these measures succeed, we could start a flow ofItalians before Christmas, and have some of them in the pits at the endof the winter.(e) There is less difficulty about using Irishmen, who, althoughsometimes objected to on other grounds, are not regarded as foreigners&quot;by the Union.     The Official Coal Committee is pursuing this matterurgently, and I understand that very soon they hope to be able to reportprogre s s.

If the above measures should make it necessary for theNational Coal Board to raise the price of coal by some small percentagi(e.g. Z or 3 per cent), I hope the Cabinet will agree that I should authorise them to do it.15. I repeat that unless bold measures such as the above are taken we shall probably be faced with a veritable disaster in ameasurable period of time.     The National Coal Board believe that theycan produce 240 million tons of coal with 615,000 men by the year 1965;but at the present rate man-power will fall to 615,000, not by 1965, butby the end of 1953.     This would mean that the decline of Britain as a world Power would- date from 1950.P.J.N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power,S.W.1,1ST DECEMBER, 1950.

ANNEX IOFFICIAL GOAL COMMITTEEThird Report by the Chairman to tlieMinister of Fuel and PowerOne.of the measures to increase output which the OfficialCoal Committee has been considering under the general heading of man-power is the introduction of supplementary pensions for miners.    I attach a copy of the report of the Working party which we set up to investigate this question.    The conclusions&quot;of the Working Party are summarised in paragraph 8 of there-port, and the main arguments on each side are as follows:-In favour of the announcement of a scheme2.      (a)    Wastage of man-power would tend to be reduced and recruitment improved,  even in the short term, although it isimpossible to estimate by how much and the contribution tooutput this winter is not likely to be considerable.(b) In the longer terra,  as pension rights accumulate,the effect on wastage may be expected to grow; but this will be offset te the extent that miners cease work at an earlierage then they would otherwise have done, and to the extent that the position in coal became relatively less advantageousin the event of supplementary pensions schemes spreading inother industries.(c) i*gain in the long term,  a steadier labour force islikely to result,  and output may be expected to improve, as aresult of improved morale.Against a scheme3.      (a)    The cost of coal will be immediately increased bysomething like 6d to 1/- per ton.      If it proves necessary; toraise wages to cover the workers&apos;  contributions, costs willalso be increased on this account.(b) If it proves impossible to resist claims for theintroduction of similar schemes in other socialised industries;(i)   There is likely to be a considerable effecton costs and prices in. the economy as a wholebecause of the need to cover the share  ofcontributions to be paid by the industry,  and -possibly also- because of wage increases to offset premiums paid by the workers.(ii)   Provision for supplementary -pensions wouldspread rapidly through -private industry withrepercussions  on their costs and prices.    i .and (iix)    The advantages from putting coalmining in a.favoured position- as compared with otherindustries will be lost.(c) Government policy regarding supplementary pensions- in industry generally&quot;may be prejudiced by ad hoc decisions on--one.. par t-ic-ul a r indue t ry.

U*      in discussion of the report the Committee thought that itwas extremely doubtful whether supplementary pensions could be restricted to the coal industry alone.    The Ministry of Fuel railPower, however, suggested that if it was considered thatsupplementary pensions generally were &quot;bound to come in the longrun,  there was good reason for introducing them at this criticalstage in the mining industry;  and that even though the effect on output might &quot;be small we could not afford to lose even, a smallbeneficial effect from each of a number of measures affectingman-power.    The Ministry urged that the coal shortage to-day was so marginal that even a relatively few men could make a significant contribution; a man^produces five tons a week, anda relatively small number would help appreciably towardsachieving the target recently set by the Minister of Fuel and power to the National Union of Mine Workers, namely 50,000 tonsa week above last year1a output.5.      It is impossible to say whether the announcement of adecision to introduce supplementary pensions would have any significant effect on man-power and thus on output in the mines in the near-future.    The majority of the Committee thought itwould&apos;not.    The  effect on costs and prices of the introductionof a scheme would, however, he immediate, appreciable, andirreversible; moreover it would increase as time went on.    Itwas,  therefore, the general view of the Committee that any advantage- which was likely to be gained, was outweighed, by theprobable adverse effects on the economy which would follow froman extension of the scheme,  and, with the Ministry of Fuel and power dissenting,  they considered that an extension to allsocialised industries was bound to follow.    The Committeetherefo.ro do not recommend this measure.(3igned)    E. N.  PLOWDEN(on behalf of the OfficialC oa1 Commi ttee)

MAN-POWER RECRUITMENT AND WASTAGE IN THE COAL MININGINDUSTRY.The Committee has considered, two reports by a Working party on Man-power, Recruitment and Wastage in the Goal Mining Industry,and submits the following report.I. MINING MAN-POWER:  general POSITION2. There is general agreement that measures to check thepresent decline in man-power, and to increase man-power in certain areas,  are a necessary element in the solution of the presentproblem.      The Committee has therefore not found it necessary to conduct a full examination into the longer term aspects ofman-power in the industry.    In the longer term,  the National coal board and the Ministry of Fuel and Power expect to be able toincrease coal output adequately with a declining labour force.Indeed the decline in total man-power during .1950 is not likelyto be appreciably higher than in the forecast at the beginningof the year.    But the number of face workers has gone down morethan we expected and this,  coupled with the failure of output per man shift to increase to tfne extent expected, has made itclear that  the rate of decline &apos;oouay is too fast for our needs.It should be emphasised that the problem is mainly one ofproviding more labour in particular areas.      In certain areas,i.e.  Scotland, Northumberland,  Durham, Kent and most  of the EastMidlands, there is no present shortage of mining labour.II. RECRUITMENT.3. Recruitment  this year,  as will be seen from Annex 1,has-been slightly better than last year, though the numbers arestill below those of preceding years.      There has in particularbeen a slight but encouraging increase in thy recruitment ofjuveniles (under 18).       In a state of full  employment,   and sineethere is no direction of labour, the problem of recruitment,  as of wastage, largely turns on conditions inside the industry ascompared with those in other occupations.      These issues aru foeresponsibility of the  Coal Board,  and in this Report we have concentrated our attention on possible action affecting generalgovernmental policy.(a)      Option for National Service Men.h. It has been suggested that young men should be given  an opportunity to opt for two years&apos;  employment  in mines as analternative to military service.      At present men working in the mines are not called up for military service but become liable for call up if they leave the mines before the age of 26.      Ithas not been possible to make, any estimate of the number of young men who would take this option.      If a few thousand choseto go to the mines,  they would help to increase productionimmediately, since they could be sent to districts whereadditional manpower would allow immediate upgrading of moreexperienced men to the face.OFFICIAL  COAL COMMITTEEFOURTH REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN TO THE MINISTER OF___FUEL AMD POWER.

5. If such a scheme was introduced,   young men already inthe mines would claim the same option.      The Ministry of fuel and Power consider that this claim could be met by allowingminers to leave the pits without liability to military serviceafter two more years&apos; work,  i.e.  at the time when the firstoptants would be leaving the industry.      On this basis thearrangement would help to improve manpower in 1951  and 1952,with the likelihood of a larger loss in 1953,  and the considered view of the National Goal Board and the Ministry of fuel and Power is that on this basis the scheme&apos; is desirable,On the other hand, the Ministry of Labour consider that it wouldbo impossible for Ministers to hold this line and that  it would prove necessary to allow existing miners who had already workedtwo years since the time when they would normally have been called up,  to leave the pits without liability to militaryservice.      If this were the oase, we all agree that the scheme would probably lose mining labour and ought not to beintroduced.6. There are some other points to be home in mind.A scheme of this kind would create a breach in present principlesof National Service,  though there are precedents for the special treatment  of the mining industry,  as in the present arrangementsfor call up.      The effect  on miners has also to be assessed.It has been suggested that they might treat the scheme asproving that work in the mines was as arduous and dangerous asactive service overseas.    Furthermore there would be problemsof absorption if the scheme brought in young men from outsidethe mining communities.      The National Coal Board would however be prepared to run these risks,  and we have not allowed themto affect  our attitude.7.        -&apos; The Committee accordingly recommend that Ministersshoula consider the question whether it would be possiblepolitically not to allow existing miners who had served morethan two years since call up age, exemption from military serviceif they left  the mines.       If this line cannot be held,  the schemeis clearly disadvantageous.    If it can,  the Ministry of Fuel and power and the National Coal Board consider that the option shouldbe introduced without delay.    . The majority of the Committee,however,  are doubtful about the desirability of the scheme evenon this basis,  and consider that an endeavour should be made before a definite decision is reached, to get some assessmentwhether an appreciable number of young men would be likely toexercise this option.       One possible solution might be to ask theSocial Survey to conduct  a review among the young men who will becalled up in the near future, provided that this did not give anyundesirable publicity to the consideration of the problem.    TheMinistry of Fuel and Power doubt both whether this proviso couldbe satisfied and even if it could,  whether any useful result would follow an enquiry by the Social Survey.(b) Action by the Ministry of Labour.8. We have discussed fully the ways in which theMinistry of Labour will be able to give further help in gettingadditional man-power for the National Coal Board in the mining-districts where it  is needed.    The Committee,  and the Ministryof Fuel and Power,  are fully satisfied that the administrative measures which will be taken by the Ministry of Labourrepresent  the best  line of approach.      The  situation will be watched locally between the Ministry&apos; of Labour and the national coal Board, who for their part will be willing &quot;to accept menlikely to make a real contribution to production even though they may not be intending to make mining their permanent career.

(c)     Act ion by the National Coal Board.  .9. The National Coal Board have been endeavouring toincrease recruitment in the areas whore it is most needed.      Mostcan be done locally,  since men who have taken up other work butare still living in mining communities are fully aware of conditions in the industry and can best be approached throughlocal advertising and local contacts.      We recommend, however,that advantage should be taken of the public impact of the news of our coal difficulties by the National Coal Board conductingan intensified recruiting campaign, adapted to the needs ofparticular localities but backed&apos;by appropriate nationalpublicity.     We consider that this campaign should be conducted in conjunction with the Ministry of Fuel and Power and theMinistry of Labour and that it should be the whole time chargeof one man fully.experienced in this field, assisted locallyby experienced staff devoting their full time attention to it.We recommend that the campaign should be stnrted off by ageneral Government announcement, underlin .      the importanceof coal mining to the economy of the count. gP urging men tojoin the industry,  and making it clear that the government attach so much importance to mining that  it does not call upminors for military training and that the best contributioneveryone in the industry can make is to stay in it and give oftheir best.      We attach great importance to the canpaign being-undertaken at onee.and with the greatest vigour.( d)     Iris h and 11 al i an L abou r.10. Urgent work is proceeding on the possibilitiesof introducing Irish and Italian labour and we shall report further upon this as soon as possible.III.     WASTAGE11. Statistics of wastage are given in the Appendix. Someis inevitable,  and the general rate of wastage, about 10 percent, is not exceptional in comparison with other industries.Nevertheless a relatively small reduction in the level of voluntary wastage would produce valuable additional quantitiesof coal.    In the main,  the reduction of voluntary wastagedepends on general conditions in the mining industry in&apos;relation to conditions in industry generally, and is also amatter of internal personnel management.      The national coal Board is trying to effect  improvements,  and we -do not discuss these in this Report.      We have concentrated our attention on a number of suggestions affecting general labourpolicy.(a)   The reimpositton of the Ring Pence.12. The Ring Pence was removed from the mining industry at  the beginning of the year:      previously a man who hod beenin the industry for three months could not  leave the industrywithout  the permission of the Ministry of Labour.      (Thispermission was in fact given when the miner could make a good case.)      The Ring Fence was removed because the Board consideredthat  it had a deterrent effect on recruitment.      It is difficultto estimate how far its removal has on the one hand increasedwastage,  and on the other.improve recruitment during the year.The&apos; high rate of wastage in the early months of the year must be

attributed in part to the removal of the Sing Pence but on theother hand the increase in the numbers of miners returning fromother industries may also be a consequence of the removal.13. The National Coal Board and the Ministry of Fuel and power are not in favour of reimposing the Ring Pence.      Theyconsider it likely that its reimposition would have an adverse effect .&amp;tt- recruitment Which would largely offset its restrainingeffect on wastage.      These considerations would apply also to a&quot;&quot;temporary reimposition,  especially at a time of year when mentend to come back to the mines, for men would not feel certainthat it would be temporary.1h; The Ministry of Labour agree.      They point out alsothat when the Ring Pence was previously in existence, therewas a general Control of Engagements Order.      To reimpose theRing Pence would therefore apply to the mining industry control which is not now applied to any other industry,  evenin a mild form.      Its reimposition would be likely to causeresentment.15, Por these reasons the Committee recommend that theRing- Pence should not be reimposed.(b)      Ban on volunteering for the Forces.&quot;16. .      it is estimated that some 930 miners volunteeredfor the Forces between July and October,  and the Ministryof Fuel and Power, with the concurrence of the National coal board, proposed that miners should not be accepted asvolunteers for the regular Forces.      They pointed out that special steps were taken to protect and restore miningman-power in both World Wars.     In the view of the rest of theCommittee,  there are major objections to this suggestion.The first is that miners are free to leave the industry to take up any other work they like, however unimportant.      It would behardly defensible therefore to prevent them from joining the armed forces, which is work of major national importance.Secondly,  any miner who was anxious to volunteer could do soby leaving the mines for some other industry with a view toVolunteering later.      The Ministry of Labour also draw attentionto the possible repercussions at a time when it is of vitalnational importance to increase regular recruitment for theforces.i7. The Committee,  therefore, with the Ministry of fuel and Power reserving their position,  could not recommendthis course.      The Committee appreciated that some miners mightbe joining up because they considered that military service was preferable in the national interest and they recommend thatin the general Government announcement on mining man-power.whichthey suggest in paragraph 9,  it should be made clear that the bestcontribution that miners can make is to stay in the mines.( c)      Releases of Reservists and Volunteers from the Forces.18. It is convenient to discuss these two suggestions inrelation to the previous one.      The Ministry of Fuel and Power and national Goal Board suggested that men who had volunteered, andare now serving,  and reservists who had been called to thecolours,  should be given an opportunity to return to the mines.

This might make a small but valuable immediate contribution toman-power.    On the other hand the general&apos;objection to the -previous suggestion is equally applicable.      Moreover theCommittee was informed that all the reservists recalled by theArmy who are now retained.in the Service are in Korea,  and that&apos;many of them are in the battalion of the Royal NorthumberlandFusiliers which would be entirely disrupted by this proposal.    Itwas also relevant that the bulk of the ex-minors.in thisbattalion were from Northumberland and Durham, where there wasno serious labour difficulty, though on this point the Ministrywere prepared to give an undertaking that no men would be recalledwho could not be given work in the mines.19. The Ministry of Fuel and Power considered that thevalue of these miners should bo regarded as outweighing themilitary difficulties of returning them to the industry.      As hasbeen emphasised, the quantities of coal needed are marginal andthe output of even 2,000 men (volunteers and reservists)amounted to over -g- million tons a year,  a significant amount inrelation to the present shortage of 2 to 3 million tons.Military difficulties had not been allowed during either the191ll/18 or the 1939/us wars to stand in the way of the return of many thousands of miners from the forces,  (about 160,000 in191U/18 and about 30,000 in 1939/us).      The Ministry found itdifficult to follow why a much smaller number could not be spared, now, when military difficulties were presumably not *.  -as great  as they were in a general war, but the coal situation was no less serious,  and. indeed may turn out to be more serious,than it v/as during the war.SO. The Committee, with the Ministry of Fuel and Powerreserving their position., does not recommend either of these suggestions.      As to the future, the War Office have also urgedthat the Regular&apos; Reserves of the Army must be left  intact, and available for unrestricted use to enable small forces to bemobilised in an emergency.      The Committee appreciated thispoint of principle but considered that  as a matter of expediencythe Services should avoid calling up further Reservists from the mines at a time -when shortages of coal might jeopardise our whole industrial and rearmaments effort.(Signed)    E.
