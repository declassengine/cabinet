CCU ME NT IS THE -PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)&apos;SECRETCP. (50) 281 COPY NO.   gj fa29TH NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETCOAL SITUATION:   OPPOSITION CRITICISMMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerSince I made my statement&apos;on coal in the House on the20th November, the Opposition Press have been asserting that the signs ofthe approaching difficulties have been plain for some time, and that theGovernment should have recognised them and taken action months ago.The short answer to this criticism is that, so far as production was concerned, there was no real cause for anxiety until October.   The courseof production is shown in the first graph attached to this paper.2. It will be seen from this graph that, apart from the drop in August (from which, because of holiday complications, no reliableconclusion can be drawn), production this year was above last year&apos;s.level until the middle of October.3. It is true that the margin was not large;   but it was sufficient to give us reasonable confidence of being able to achieve the lower of the two output estimates for 1950 given in the economic survey, namely 205 million tons, compared with the 1949 output of202. 7 million tons.    It is open to argument whether we should have accepted so low a figure.    Certainly, in the light of our experiencethis year, we must recognise that our present situation would have been better, if we had urged the National Coal Board to aim at a higher total output.   And certainly we must aim at a greater expansion next year andthe year after, and we must ensure that the means are provided bywhich tinat expansion can be attained.   But the fact remains that the figureof 205 million tons for 1950 was accepted and published, and that solong as it seemed possible to attain it, no one could say that the government ought to be taking emergency action.4. But were we justified in assuming that this 205 million tons would be achieved?   The answer is, I think, undoubtedly that we were.An increase from 202.7 million tons to 205 million tons means that on average, and taking good weeks in with bad weeks, weekly output would need to exceed last year &apos;s corresponding figures by 45,000 tons a week.In actual fact, output has been as follows:-1-

As will be seen from the above figures, and from the second graphattached, the weekly output in 1950 from January to September averaged 47, 000 tonsa week above last year&apos;s level, compared with the 45,000 tons needed to provide an output of 205 million tons for the year.Indeed, until the middle of October it was open to us to hope thatthe autumn spurt in production would come as it did last year;   and if, as the resultof the autumn spurt, the increase in output per man shift had been maintainedit the level of last autumn&apos;s increase, as on all previous experience we were entitled to suppose it would be, then we should have reached 205 million tons for theyear&apos;s output.But while, until a short time ago, output was in accordance withestimates,, the high level of exports in the earlier part of the year gave meconsiderable misgivings.    This is, of course, a domestic matter within theGovernment,, but I must place on record the view that it was, in the light ofevents, a mistake for the Government last May to decide, against the adviceQf the Ministry of Fuel and Power, that export commitments should be entered into0n the basis that 20 million tons would be available for export during the year.

The Ministry felt that the top figure should have been 19 million tons, and that,pending a clearer idea of our prospects, commitments should have been limited.to an even lower figure.7. Be that as it may, the high level of the export programme was undoubtedly a contributing factor to the shortfall of 1 million tons in our end-October stocks.8. But our concern must, of course, now be with the future,(i)   In September and October the exceptionally heavy rains reducedopencast output by 400,000 tons.(ii)   In the first 4 weeks *f November, output of deepmined coal averaged82,000 tons less than in the corresponding weeks last year.(iii)   If such a rate of shortfall continued, it would mean -a. loss of. 4 million tons a year and an output falling from 204 million tons, whicwe may hope to achieve in 1950, to 200 million tons next year.(iv)   It would further mean that unless special measures were taken this winter&apos;s coal deficit would be increased from the 2\ million tonsgiven in my previous paper (C. P. (50) 271) to 3 million tons, withthe result that our end-winter stocks would fall to 6 million tons.9. - What has been the cause of this failure of output to reach the levelof 1949 during the autumn?Not absenteeism, which has been somewhat lower than a year ago..Not primarily the loss of man-power.If wastage had been less, of course, output would have been higher;and increase of man-power must now be a major objective of policy.But, even with the fall in man-power which has happened, we shouldhave exceeded last year&apos;s output this autumn, instead of falling below it, if output per man shift had risen as much as past experience had led us to expect.The following figures illustrate the point:Output per man week...   , &apos; - 1950 1949Week ending Output- Increase Output-&quot;   Increasesince previous since previousdate date- Cwts.  -3 0th September	117	-	112	-28th October	120	-  3	117	511th November	122	2	120	318th November	12.3	. 1	121	l69

Thus, so far in October and November, 1950, the miners have only added6 cwts. to their weekly output, whereas in the corresponding period in 1949,they added 9 cwts.   An additional 3 cwt. a man on the weekly output of the630,000 or so men at work would have meant another 95,000 tons a week:and we should have been appreciably above last year&apos;s level instead of80,000 tons below it.10. Thus the failure of output per man shift to rise as much as was expected has been the chief cause of the difficulty we shall have in ensuringadequate supplies of coal to the nation during the coming months.   It is thereally dangerous feature of the situation, because it undermines the basis onwhich our calculations of output for the next few years have been based.We must have this constantly in mind when we consider the longer-term measures which are required.11. The Opposition Press have also urged that this failure of outputhas been the sole cause of our present difficulty, and that the increased demands of industry, etc. , due to full employment, were all foreseen, andshould have been allowed for in the policy we pursued.   We must expect thatthe Opposition in Parliament will seek to develop this argument into a formidable attack.12. Our defence against this attack is I think as follows:(i)   Inland consumption, as a result of full employment, has risen to thehigher of the two figures (199 - 201 million tons) given in ourestimate for 1950.(ii)   Deepmined output has been below the lower of the two figures (205 - 2.10million tons) given in our estimate for 1950.    Until very recently, this could not be foreseen, for the reasons given above;   but it isalarming, and we propose to take vigorous and effective steps tohelp the National Coal Board to expand output, both in the immediatefuture, and in the next few years.   We must recognise, however,the great engineering and geological difficulties which the national coal Board have to confront;   it is most unfortunate, but not surprising, if occasionally they fall a little behind the targets whichthey set.(iii)   Our position this autumn would have been much better, if we had exportedless coal in the first six months of 1950.    But our exports weremade for compelling reasons of national and international policy.(iv)   We have taken energetic and comprehensive measures to meet the- risks of the coming winter.(v)   But the only real answer to the long-term problem is to get more coalproduced at home.    This we mean to do.P.J.N-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W, 1. ,29TH NOVEMBER, 1950.
