I have, during the last few months, been considering thematter in consultation with my advisers and with the Governors who have been over here on leave or on visits, and have had the advantage of the views of the Ministerof State, who has recently visited East Africa. I have come to the conclusion thatit will be best to pursue^the matter) for the time being at any rate, separately in each territory rather than on a&quot;&quot;genefal East African basis.In Uganda there have very recently been constitutional changes which havedoubled the African membership of the Legislature from four to eight and whichhave provided for a measure of popular selection of those representatives. I feelthat Uganda should develop in its own way, for its circumstances differ much fromthose both in Kenya and Tanganyika. In Tanganyika a local committee isconsulting all shades of opinion before making proposals for constitutional advance.I am sure the House will agree that the process of local consultation should be carried through before constitutional changes are made. As regards Kenya, the Governorwill, following on his discussions here, shortly be consulting with local opinion onthe next steps. When he has carried out that consultation he will be in a positionto put forward proposals and I hope then to be able to make a further statement to the House.2. In the meantime it may be useful if I make clear certain basic principlesof policy which must be observed (i) As has been repeatedly stated by His Majesty&apos;s Government with the assent of all parties, our long-term aim is self-government within theCommonwealth.(ii) Self-government  must  include  proper provision  for  all  the maincommunities which have made their home in East Africa. In the longrun their security and well-being must rest on their good relations with each other and not upon any undertaking by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom. Good relations cannot flourish while thereis fear and suspicion between the communities; it must therefore be our task to create conditions where that fear and suspicion disappear.39645
(iii) By our presence in these territories we haveiset &quot;AMcans on the path ofpolitical, social and economic development, and it is our task to help them to develop wisely and prosperously, so that they may take their full part, with the other sections of the community, in the administration andxsVt %q.0&apos;-&apos;t development of the territories. TBAOBZ(iv) When Africans have reached the stage of taking their full $q^ffld&quot;$b$other communities are sure of a future in Easf Africa we^an iropVfor1a state of harmony and mutual confidence on which a^Govexm^eiilin which all sections will participate can be soundly based. Until that stage is reached, and it will be some time before it is reached, it isessential that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom shouldcontinue to exercise its ultimate control in the East African territories,while allowing within that framework all reasonable freedom of actionto the local Governments.(v) Future policy must be worked out in full consultation with those whobelong to the territories.   I appeal to all those who belong to East&apos;Africa, of whatever race and creed they may be, and to all in thiscountryi Who are concerned for the future of those territories, to work together towards that goal of true partnership on which: the futureprosperity and happiness of all in East Africa must depend. . .The following additional statement to be made in answer to an arranged Supple-mentary Question.This statement relates to East Africa, but it will be clear to Hon. Membersthat the basic principles of policy which I have just set out apply equally to central africa. I hope to be in a position to make a further statement on northern rhodesia in the fairly near future.


THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe  circulation  of this paper  has  been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use oi...:Jh*t.  /tfm?r*o**/.......&amp;**$^   ..TOP SECRET Copy No.CP.(50) 27114TH NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETCOAL EMERGENCY measures memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power attach for the Cabinet&apos;s consideration a report on the coal situation by the Official Coal Committee under Sir Edwin PIowden&apos;chairmanship.    I am very grateful to him and to the Official coal committee for a prompt, clear and close analysis of our coal prospectsduring the coming winter, and of the immediate measures that might betaken to improve them.2. I am in substantial agreement both with the analysis and withthe remedies that are proposed.    There has been a serious deterioration-tion in the past few weeks.    Until October, coal output had been abovelast year&apos;s level but recently it has fallen badly below that level -Output in 1950        *compared with 1949Tons 000&apos;sOctober3rd week............... -   64th     &quot;     ............... - 41November1st week................ - 582nd    &quot;     ................ - 813. We cannot possibly ignore the significance of this decline and ofits rapid acceleration.    Even supposing there is no further increase inthe rate of decline, it will mean that we shall have a deficit of nearly Z\million tons on our winter coal operations, which in turn must mean thatour stocks in the winter may drop below the minimum safety level of 9million tons to 7 million tons (with house coal stocks at nil, and merchantsshort on their deliveries to householders by \ million tons).     I need onlypoint out that it was the fall of stock to 8. 3 million tons in December, 1946,and the further fall to 6. 7 million tons in January, 1947, that landed us inthe fuel crisis which did so much damage to our economy.     I should add that the greatest hardship would inevitably fall on the poorer sections ofthe community, who have to rely on small weekly deliveries of coal;   forany priority system for the poorer consumers must inevitably break downwhen a coal merchant has no coal to deliver.x  With losses through disputes omitted for both years.-1-
