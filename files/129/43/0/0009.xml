COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA IN CONNECTIONWITH THE KOREAN CAMPAIGNMemorandum by the Attorney-GeneralMy colleagues may recall that on 18th September, 1950,the Cabinet considered my memorandum (CP. (50) 207) in whichI drew attention to the legal status of the present military operations in Korea and expressed the view that whether or not they constituted a war, as to which there was some doubt in view of President TrumanTsexpress declaration that the United States was not at war, the NorthKoreans were nonetheless enemies of His Majesty for the purposesof the law of treason and that, therefore, the law of treason wasapplicable.   With this latter view the Lord Chancellor agreed and the Cabinet invited the Minister of State to arrange for theDepartments concerned to consider the practical implicationswhich would follow from one view or the other as to the existenceof a state of war (CM. (50) 60th Conclusions, Minute 3(2)).   Thematter is, I believe, still being examined.2. I must, however, now ask my colleagues whether they know of any matters, either of an international or a domestic character, to whichI ought to have regard in deciding whether or not to prosecute those responsible for propaganda conducted by the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; in supportof the Communist cause in Korea.3. I have already had certain Parliamentary Questions in regardto this propaganda and have been asked whether it is proposed to seeklegislative powers to deal with activities of this kind.   On 19th October,I answered a Question by Et. Col. Bromley-Davenport in the following terms:-&quot;I can readily understand the strong resentment causedby the activities of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; and its correspondentwho is alleged to be in Korea.   It is not proposed to seekadditional powers but I must again observe that it must notbe assumed that the law of treason does not apply to thepresent situation in Korea. &quot;The matter has been brought to a head by a letter from Lt. Col. Bromley-Davenport to the Foreign Office which has been passed on to me to dealwith.   In this he calls attention to a pamphlet issued by the publishers of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;.IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 259 COPY NO.    3 22ND NOVEMBER, 1950CABINET

4. This pamphlet, besides making grave allegations againstAmerican soldiers and airmen, seeks to establish that what has happened in Korea was the result not of an attack from the North but of american aggression.   I call particular attention to the finalparagraphs of the pamphlet, the text of which is reproduced in the annex to this memorandum.5. I have no doubt that this publication constitutes the offence of treason in giving &quot;aid and comfort to the K-ing&apos;s enemies&quot;.Indeed, it is part of systematic propaganda intended , as headlines inthe &quot;Daily Worker&quot; have expressly said, to ensure that &quot;not a man, nota gun, not a ship&quot; is sent to Korea.   If a prosecution for treasonwere to be instituted, it would no  doubt cover systematic publicationof this kind from the beginning of the Korean incident,6. I must say that I am extremely loath to take proceedings for treason in respect of these publications,   It seems to me that thelaw of treason accompanied by the inevitable death penalty is far to*heavy a weapon with which to attack propaganda of this sort.   the trouble is that there is no other weapon.   During the war there wasemergency legislation which enabled prosecutions to be taken for lesseroffences in respect of action which might also have constitutedtreason.    Under the law as it exists at present, however, the offenceis treason or nothing and we are now faced with the dilemma of deciding either to prosecute for treason in respect of propaganda which a Jury might well think (as indeed I do) not to merit the death penalty or of saying that the law of treason is not a suitable remedy forsuch propaganda but that no other remedy is provided by the law.Reluctant as I should be to take proceedings for treason in existingcircumstances, I think I must warn my colleagues that there may well beParliamentary difficulty if I am forced into conceding that this propaganda is treasonable but at the same time announce that I do not propose totake action.7. I should add that I anticipate similar difficulties at theso-called Peace Congress at Sheffield.   No doubt aliens guilty oftreasonable conduct will be deported forthwith.   So far as british subjects are concerned it may be possible to deal with themsummarily by proceedings under S. 5 of the Public Meetings Act, 1936.But some limit will have to be placed on the licence which is permitted.H. W. S.Royal Courts of Justice, W. C. 2. ,2ND NOVEMBER, 1950.

ANNEXText of final paragraphs of pamphlet entitled&quot;I saw the truth in Korea&quot; by Alan Winnington,Daily &quot;Worker Correspondent in Peking.X     X     X     X&quot;The last war was made inevitable by Chamberlain&apos;smad dream of becoming Hitler&apos;s partner in a war against the soviet union.   Is history going to repeat itself at an atomic level?The key is Britain and the time is now.   That is why the mogulof Wall Street have exerted such giant pressure to drag our people in the blood-bath they prepared for five years in Korea, and that is why, no sooner had the lackey Attlee promised them their &quot;token&quot;,than they sent their aircraft into China to spread the zone of thewar.It is America which has invaded Korea.    To defend the interests of Morgan and Rockefeller, of Dupont and the steelbarons, to restore the land to the feudal landlords, to drive thepeople back to penury, to maintain a war base against the peacefulSoviet Union.Are British lads to be sacrificed to these ignoble aims?Is Britain to become the lackey of an America which aspires toHitler&apos;s role - joint detonators of a new world war?Britain&apos;s trade unions, Labour Party branches,progressive organisations and people of every sort can and must give the answer quickly:Withdraw All Foreign Soldiers From KorealHANDS       OFF      CHINA.PRESERVE WORLD PEACE
