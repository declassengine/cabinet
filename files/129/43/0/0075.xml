(50) 325\9th December, 1950CABINETBALANCE OF CIVIL pay memorandum by the Home SecretaryWhen this matter was discussed on 7th December (CM. (50) 83rd Con-clusions, Minute 3), I said that the proposals put forward in the memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer of 15th November, 1950 (CP. (50) 274), were likelyto prove unpopular with the police.2. As in the case of the Civil Service, balance of civil pay was given to thepolice in the last three wars. It has therefore come to be regarded as the normalarrangement, and any alteration would be looked on as a worsening of policeconditions. The legislation under which action was taken during the last war has expired, but the Police Reservists (Allowances )Act, 1914, is still in being.That Act empowers police authorities to grant limited allowances to policemencalled up for service with the armed forces, and the Police Federation has alreadyrequested that in the absence of other legislation I should draw the attention ofpolice authorities to this Act and enjoin them to put it into operation for thebenefit of policemen who have been called up for service in connection with the conflict in Korea. I have not done this because the general question was underconsideration and the Act of 1914 is in any case inappropriate to modern conditions.3. Reference has been made to the practice of the best employers in private industry and commerce. I have been informed by representatives of the policethat some employers are now making up the balance of civil pay for employeescalled up for service in Korea. An announcement that, as a consequence of generalGovernment policy, the police were not to have their pay made up, either inrespect of the conflict in Korea or in respect of any general war, would influencemen and women, now in private employment, against joining the police and mightwell encourage wastage from the police to private employment. Recruitment forthe police is still by no means satisfactory, and, apart from peace-time needs, Ido not need to emphasise the importance in the event of war of a well-mannedand contented police service.4. These are the main considerations which in my view make it desirableto give balance of civil pay so far as the police are concerned. There is, however,one particular matter which ought in any event to be provided for and for which legislation will be necessary. The legislation in force during the last war enabledpolice authorities to continue to pay rent allowances where married policemen(or single policemen with equivalent responsibilities) in receipt of rent allowances were called up for service in the armed forces. This was done because the provisionof free quarters or a rent allowance in lieu is part of the general conditions of serviceof the police and it would obviously be unjust to evict families from free quarterswhile the man is away. The merits of this matter are not affected by the decision\ on the grant of the balance of civil pay except to the extent that, if balance of civilpay be not granted, the hardship entailed by failure to authorise continued enjoy-ment of provided quarters or rent allowance would be all the greater.39814
5. Similar considerations as regards balance of civil pay apply to the fire service. Firemen are organised in a Trade Union affiliated to the T.U.C. the fire Brigades Union and it appears that the Union have raised this question onthe T.U.C. Advisory Committee for Local Government Services; the Union&apos;s* Journal states that the Advisory Committee have circulated all Unions concerned to ascertain their views.J. C.
