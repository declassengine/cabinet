HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST YTS GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (50) 26710TH NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETCHINESE INTERVENTION IN KOREAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have been considering the implications of Chinese intervention in korea.   China has not so far openly committed herself, nor has she thrownher full resources into the fighting in Korea.   United Nations, andparticularly South Korean, forces have been caught ill-prepared and havebeen forced to yield ground, but if the scale of Chinese intervention is limited it may still be possible for the Unified Command, with theforces already at its disposal in Korea, to carry the campaign through to a successful conclusion.   This would permit the withdrawal of the bulk ofthe United Nations forces and enable the United Nations Commission tomake progress with the formidable task of political and economicrehabilitation of the country.2. There is some evidence that the Chinese are not anxious to commit themselves to full-scale intervention, but we cannot count on this.   Thoughthe evidence is still scanty, it is important that we should attempt to assessChinese intentions and motives, and to study the graver implications inthe situation.   Chinese intervention on a scale sufficient to inflict aserious reverse on United Nations forces might develop into openhostilities between China and the United Nations, leading even to general war between China and the United States and to a possible Chinese appealto Russia under the Sino-Soviet Pact.   These are the contingencies whichmust be borne in mind.Chinese Motives3. It is not easy for us to analyse Chinese motives and see thesituation as the Chinese see it.   Not only is it difficult to understandChinese psychology, but we lack the factual data on which to base a study.Nevertheless, the attempt must be made, though any conclusions reachedmust be regarded as only tentative until fuller information is available.4. In the first place - and this to my mind is of cardinal importance -they achieved success in their revolution despite the very great assistance given to the Nationalist Government by the United States of America, who,after the war, therefore supplanted the Japanese as Public Enemy No. 1to the Chinese Communist Party.   The continuing hostility of the Americanpress and public to the new China and the continuing sympathy shown tothe Nationalist Government have confirmed the Chinese in their impression of the implacable hostility of America.   Brilliant military successesin China almost without outside assistance have given the Chinese over-weening self-confidence in their own powers.   The war with Japan hadearlier shown them that China could not be finally subdued by foreignCOPY NO.

armies so long as the people rallied to the support of the authorities:to the present Chinese Government, support for whom-came from thepeasantry rather than from the cities, and who contrived to survive andconquer though denied not only foreign imports but the industrial production of Chinese cities, the threat of aerial bombardment may appear less serious than it was to the Nationalists.5. In addition, the Chinese share certain communist characteristics.As in other communist countries, free interchange of men and ideas withdemocratic countries is avoided because of the dangers of ideologicalinfection.   The party members and the masses must be kept pure andimmune from outside contagion.   The enmity of the non-communistworld is an article of faith, and it may be that, just as Russia has sought to erect a barrier ring of satellites for her own defence, so the Chineseleaders aspire to create a Union of Chinese Socialist Republics fromTibet through South East Asia to Formosa and Korea.   In the case ofChina, the instinct towards isolation from the outside world goes backmany centuries.   Consciously or unconsciously, the Chinese may be seeking to reproduce the old system of a Chinese Empire and a ring ofvassal states.6. Finally, some of the present Chinese leaders have little experienceof international affairs^   I do not rate this factor very highly as a number ofobservers, including for example General Marshall, have been impressed by the shrewd and realistic outlook of men like Chou en Lai.1. If this analysis of the Chinese mind is accurate, excessive self-confidence in their own abilities, profound suspicion of American policy,fear of the consequences of contacts with the west, inexperience andignorance are among the motives actuating them in their policy towardsKorea.8. This analysis does not purport to be objective but is an attempt toset out the Chinese viewpoint.   The attitude of the American press andpublic for example, viewed objectively, was in part the natural reaction to the policies of the Chinese towards American interests.   The Chinesetook the initiative in a propaganda campaign against America and thatinitiative they still hold.   If, for example, they were to offer any evidenceof a desire for friendly relations with the Americans I think that thiswould meet with a good response.Chinese Intentions9. While a plausible explanation of Chinese motives may be given,I hesitate to guess at their intentions without more evidence than is atpresent available to me.   If the Chinese had been determined to maintain a communist buffer state in Korea, one would have expected Chinese inter-ven.;ion much sooner (in this connection it is significant that the Chinesebegan some months ago to build up their forces in Manchuria).   Thedelay in intervention may have been due to some initial reluctance tobecome involved as well as to lack of preparations on the assumption that intervention was unnecessary and that the United Nations forces could be driven out of Korea without Chinese help.   When the tide turned theChinese may have doubted whether the United Nations forces would cross the 38th parallel, or they may at least have considered it unlikely thatthe United Nations forces would proceed to the extreme northern limits of Korea.

10. I am at present inclined to think that the Chinese are feelingtheir way. . They must be aware that open intervention may expose theircities and communications to attack, and they may not be ready for this.They may intend to see whether by limited intervention they can assurea safety belt along their frontiers, while reserving their freedom towithdraw without having to admit defeat if their plans miscarry.11. It is necessary to keep in mind not only Chinese action in Koreabut their action in Tibet, the aid given to the Viet Minh in Indo-China,and the intensified propaganda campaign against British treatment of chinese in Malaya and Hong Kong.   Taken together, they do tend to supportthe supposition that the Chinese Government is not averse to the use of force, rather than negotiation, as an instrument of policy.Role of Russia12. There is no conclusive evidence of Chinese/Russian co-ordinationof policy, but bearing in mind the Chinese action in allowing Koreans fromthe Chinese armies to take part in the campaign in Korea from the outset,and bearing in mind the consistent similarity between Russian and Chinesepublicity about Korea, it is reasonable to assume co-ordination of policybetween Moscow and Peking, particularly as this is provided for in theSino-Soviet Treaty.   I doubt whether the Russians conceive it to be intheir interests to promote open hostilities between China and the UnitedStates of America, because, whatever immediate advantages such acatastrophe might appear to confer upon Russia, I doubt whether it is presentRussian policy to precipitate a world war and the Russians (and Chinese)must know that hostilities between America and China might develop intoa world war.13.        At the same time; it is in Russian interests to keep Chinese-American hostility alive, and the Russians may be counting on doing this,without running the risks of provoking a world war, by conniving atChinese actions in Korea and the Par Sast generally while themselvesassuming the role of world peace-makers.Objectives14. This analysis - which, I would remind my colleagues, is onlytentative - points to certain broad conclusions as bases for our policy:-(a) mobilisation of the maximum support for United Nations policyin Korea;(b) preventing an extension of the Korean conflict;   and(c) restraining the Chinese.15. These lines of policy are not new.   On the contrary, they havebeen the lines followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government since fighting began in Korea.    Indeed, the new Resolution before the Security Council is consistent with them.   I felt however that Chinese intervention in Koreamade it necessary to review the situation afresh and to try to assessChinese motives and intentions.   Pending further developments I amreasonably well satisfied in my own mind that we have been tackling these problems on the right lines.   I hope that my colleagues will agree.

16. While I do not consider that the new development calls for a revisionof our basic policy (though I must warn my colleagues that we shall haveto study it afresh in the event of a serious military threat to the united nations forces in Korea, or in the event of open Chinese intervention)it is urgent that we should redouble our efforts on the accepted lines of thispolicy.   The successful conclusion of the military campaign is the firstnecessity and the United Nations forces must be maintained at the requisitestrength for this purpose.   The Commander of the Unified Forces hasdecided, as a matter of military necessity, that bombing should be resumedup to the frontier.   It is important to ensure that it is not carried beyondthe Manchurian frontier without the most compelling reasons and withoutthorough study of the implications.17. In the field of Korean unification and rehabilitation, I am not satisfiedthat the United Nations Commission set up under the October 7th resolution is going about its task with the speed and vigour which the situation demands.I propose to take this up with the United Kingdom delegation in New York.18. Pandit Nehru will no doubt continue his efforts to exert a calminginfluence on the Chinese Government.   Chinese have however never heldIndians in high.esteem, and even now, after the transfer of power, it isdoubtful whether the Chinese Government attach     much weight to Indianviews, though they may think it tactically desirable to enlist Indian andAsian opinion in an anti-western crusade, and for this reason may on occasion be ready to listen to advice.19. Chinese intervention in Korea is frustrating United Nationspolicies and causing casualties to United Nations forces, and it is difficultto justify instructions to the Unified Command to refrain from what in amilitary sense is the most effective counter-action (i. e. attacks onChinese bases and communications) unless the most strenuous efforts aremade in the political field to bring this intervention to an end.   Only theChinese know why they have intervened in Korea, and the only way toascertain their motives is to give the Chinese a chance to explain them.20,        Provided always that the Chinese do not cast discretion to the windsand openly declare their defiance of the United Nations, it is therefore essential that suitable opportunities should be afforded to the ChineseGovernment to express their views and to explain their action.While I am by no means completely confident that the outcome will be satisfactory, the issues at stake are so great as to demand that everythinghumanly possible is done to this end.Policy towards China21. To avoid any possibility of misunderstanding it may be as well totake this opportunity to refer to the bearing of the Chinese intervention in korea on(a) the recognition issue,(b) the discussions for the establishment of diplomatic relationswith China, and(c) Chinese representation in the United Nations.

22.        Recognition is. of course an act of policy which is in no wayaffected by Chinese intervention in Korea.   As regards exchangingAmbassadors, it may be that despite our best efforts the ChineseGovernment may make it impossible to establish normal relations and chinese intervention in Korea may affect these discussions.   But the verypurpose of exchanging representatives with foreign countries is to enable us to discuss issues on which we are at variance and on my part I woulddeprecate any initiative by us in the direction of discontinuing these discussions to which I attach considerable importance.23.        As regards representation in the United Nations my view is that,as in the case of recognition, this is an act of policy and of recognitionof the facts of a situation and that it is not appropriate to express disapprovaby preventing the Chinese Government from taking their proper place in thevarious organs of the United Nations.24.        In short, in spite of Chinese intervention in Korea, I still regard it as an important contribution to mutual understanding that relationsbetween our two countries should be established on the normal basis of recognition and the exchange of Ambassadors and that the ChineseGovernment should be represented on the United Nations.Protection of Communities25.        In view of the present trends in China, His Majesty&apos;s Consulsare being instructed, as a precautionary measure, to advise members ofthe British and other communities for whose welfare they are responsiblethat unless their continued presence in China is essential for business,professional, or other reasons it would be as well for them to make arrangements to depart.   There is of course no intention, unless thesituation deteriorates, to arrange a mass evacuation or to causeunnecessary alarm to the communities.   Similar advice is being given atthe request of the Australian, New Zealand and United States governments to their nationals in the same category.   Canadian and South Africannationals are being informed of the   advice now being given to the UnitedKingdom nationals.   It is desirable in present circumstances thatConsular commitments as far as the protection of British or other nationals in the non-essential category is concerned, should not be unnecessarilyincreased by the presence of dependents, wives and children.   Nor wouldwe be justified, in view of the serious implications in the present situation,in delaying advising these persons to leave.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,10TH NOVEMBER, 1950.
