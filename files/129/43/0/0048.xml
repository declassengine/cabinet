THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1950SECRETCP. (50) 2986th December, 1950CABINETDEVELOPMENT OF COAL-MINING IN AFRICA AND other overseas territories memorandum by the Secretary of1 State for the Colonies and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsAnnexed for the information of our colleagues is the memorandum whichwe were invited to submit on the development of coal-mining in Africa and over-seas territories (CM. (50) 71st Conclusions, Minute 6). In the nature of things,we have considered only what might be possible within the next two or threeyears. It is impracticable, with the present limited knowledge about the extent and quality of overseas coalfields and of the factors affecting development forexport purposes, to take a longer view.2. We think the conclusion must be drawn that there is little prospect inthe near future of the overseas countries of the Commonwealth being able to redressthe position created by the reduction of coal output in Western Europe.3. At first sight Southern Rhodesia seems the most attractive prospect, butwe should recall that the possibility of exporting coal from Wankie, via a new line to a West Coast port, was considered very fully in November 1947 with the PrimeMinister and Finance Minister of Southern Rhodesia. The conclusion reached(Cf. (47) 327, paragraph 6 of Annex and Section 4 (a) of the Summary of Discus-sions attached thereto) was that until a West Coast line was built, coal for exportcould not be transported, and that any increase in output could more profitablybe used in expanding production of copper, chrome, &amp;c.4. The question of additional outlets for Southern Rhodesia was considered at the recent Johannesburg Transport Conference. A possible line to a port onthe West Coast was discussed but no definite conclusions were reached. It seems clear, however, that to secure appreciable exports from Wankie would involvevery considerable capital outlay (which could scarcely be undertaken by SouthernRhodesia), and that it would, at best, be several years before any results wereforthcoming. &quot; -J. G.PC. G-W.6th December, 1950., ANNEXDevelopment of Coal Mining in the Overseas TerritoriesA. Colonies1. The possibility of developing Colonial production of coal* was exhaustivelyconsidered by the Colonial Primary Products Committee in 1948. The Committeeconcluded that Colonial deposits are generally of poor quality compared with european coals, and that while the high cost of European coal and the heavy freight* Excluding Southern Rhodesia.39739Copy No. 3 2
charges may well make the use of local coal ah economic proposition for localpurposes, it would be dangerous to base any Colonial production on export possi-bilities without closely investigating the question of comparative costs. TheCommittee excepted coking coal from this general conclusion and felt that if anycoking coal found to exist in the Colonies proved to be of first-class quality itshould, in view of the probable long-term shortage of this type of coal, find a widermarket than the coals of lower quality.2. Colonial consumption of coal (excluding Southern khodesia) is about million tons annually, of which about 1 million tons is imported from SouthernRhodesia and rather less is produced in Nigeria and Malaya. The state of develop-ment of the more important Colonial coal deposits is set out briefly below.(i) africa. Nigeria. Nigerian coal has been worked for 40 years and production isat present between 500,000 tons and 600,000 tons annually. It is all consumed in west Africa. The coal is of poor coking quality and contains a large percentage ofash. Its high bitumen content indicates promising possibilities of extraction of oils, tars, &amp;c. As a fuel in its crude state, however, it is not thought that Nigeriancoal could compete in world markets. It is hoped to improve output to the orderof 900,000 tons by 1958, which would leave an estimated surplus of 150,000 tons for export. .4. Tanganyika.-Eight coalfields are known, three of which are extensive.The Colonial Development Corporation is energetically engaged in prospectingoperations, and it may be that there will prove to be considerable possibilities here.But the coalfields are situated in the extreme south-west of the territory and areremote from existing railways, so that even if the prospecting yields good results,it is bound to be several years before mines can be in production. The probabilityis that the coal would be used in East Africa.5. Northern Rhodesia. Several coalfields are known, but none has ever been worked. Prospecting is now taking place. The coal would be used to reduce the dependence of the Northern Rhodesian copper mines on imports from SouthernRhodesia.  It is in any case too far from the sea to make export practicable.6. Nyasdland. There are three main coal areas under investigation and theGovernment is Conducting a drilling programme. In view of the long railway haulit is improbable that these fields will be of more than local importance.   &apos;7. Southern Rhodesia. At present coal is produced only at Wankie, althoughother workable deposits are known to exist. The Wankie area is thought to containbetween 2,500 million and 4,000 million tons of extractable coal, of which350 million tons lie in the concession granted to the existing company.8. Present output, about 2 million tons a year, is insufficient for the needs of central Africa,, and deficiencies in supply have gravely hampered the expansion of output of copper in Northern Rhodesia. A development programme now beingcarried out has the object of increasing output to about 4 million tons by 1955.This is estimated to be adequate for local requirements.9. It is understood that mining at Wankie presents few difficulties, and itwould probably be possible to set up new collieries and greatly expand output.There may, however, be labour problems. &apos;     \10. The most serious difficulty would be transportation. Rhodesia railways are strained to the utmost and are having difficulty in financing the improvementsnecessary for local needs. Any proposal to move coal for export would involveheavy capital expenditure on improvements of railways and of port facilities.(Wankie is nearly 900 miles from the nearest port, Beira, and it is unlikely that theBeira route could carry coal exports.)(ii). Non-African Colonies&apos;. 11..   Malaya. The only important coalfield is in Selangor.   Mining began in1915 and,production reached its highest level, nearly 800,000 tons, in 1940.   the mines were badly damaged during the war.   The coal is of. low grade and unsuitable:for export.   It is used by the railways, mining companies and power concerns andis insufficient to meet the local demand.
12. Sarawak and North Borneo. A firm of coal-mining consultants surveyedthe deposits in the Borneo territories in 1948 and Governments are now undertakingfurther drilling to establish their extent and quality. It is believed that good cokingcoal exists in Sarawak and although the area is very remote from markets and thedevelopment of the coalfield would involve the construction of a railway and otherheavy expenditure, the investigations now going on may indicate that this iswarranted.B. Other Commonwealth Countries13. Coal is mined in varying quantities in all the overseas members of theCommonwealth except Ceylon but, with two exceptions, all need to supplementtheir own resources by imports.14. Canada. Present production is about 20 million tons a year. Imports(mostly from the United States) are at much the same level. Production is cheifly the Maritime Provinces and Alberta, but the needs of the manufacturing area ofOntario are, for price reasons, met from the United States. The resources ofCanada are such that she could be self-sufficient in coal, but the cost of movingit to the areas where it is needed would be prohibitive. The United kingdom exports to Canada about 500,000 tons of coal per annum, mostly in the form ofanthracite.15. Australia. Production of black coal is at present about 15 million tonsa year. Her own requirements are at present 18+ million tons per year, and areexpected to rise to 22^ million tons in 1953. A number of coal development schemes are under consideration, notably that at Blair Athol in Queensland, wherethe present output of \\ million tons a year could, it is thought, be raised to 3^million tons by 1960. Australia formerly exported to New Zealand, but she is now&quot;as a result of rising population and industrial expansion, short herself, and is infact an importer to the tune of about 1 million tons annually, chiefly from SouthAfrica and India.16. New Zealand-Production is about 2 million tons per year, but there isa deficiency in high-grade bituminous coals of which about 100,000 tons a year wereformerly imported from Australia. Australia^ own difficulties now prevent thesupply of coal to New Zealand, with the result that New Zealand has been obtaining supplies from the United States, South Africa and (in 1948) from the UnitedKingdom. It is probable that it will always be necessary for New Zealand to importhigh grade coal.17. South Africa. Production in 1949 was 28 million tons, of which some\ million tons were exported to many markets including New Zealand, Australia,Ceylon and Colonial territories in Africa and the Far East. Exports to Pakistanbegan in the middle of 1950.Exports have declined since 1946 (4 million tons) due to increased local con-sumption which adds to the difficulties which the already overburdened railway system has to bear. Transport to the ports remains the main limiting factor inSouth African coal exports, even though shortage of trucks has now, we understand,largely been overcome.18. India-Production is about 30 million tons a year; l\ million tons wereexported in 1949. Her markets are Australia, Ceylon and South-East Asia.Before the interruption of trade between the two countries at the end of 1949, Indiamet the needs of Pakistan. Should normal trade relations be resumed it seems doubtful whether the present rate of exports to other countries would be maintained.Her own requirements in 1949 amounted to 28 million tons as against 25 million tons in the previous year. This increase is due to the expansion of her industrialprogramme.19. Pakistan-Production is about 325.000 tons a year. She is thereforedependent on outside sources of supply for the bulk of her coal requirements,which are put at a minimum of 2\ million tons a year. Of this about 2 million tons were provided by India up to the end of 1949 when supplies from that sourceceased. Imports since then have been drawn from South Africa, Poland, Franceand, to a small extent, the United Kingdom. Plans for developing indigenousresources are under consideration, and a production figure of 800,000 tons a year&apos;s  expected by 1957.
