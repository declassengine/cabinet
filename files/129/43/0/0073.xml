THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT    232.-.--.-.--      .Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1950 &apos;      &apos; \SECRET Copy No.CP. (50) 323 &apos; &apos;     -19th December, 1950CABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATY: GENERALMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs as my colleagues are aware, for some time now discussions about a peace treaty with Japan have been proceeding in New York between officials of theUnited States Government and of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Governments ofthose Commonwealth countries which are members of the Far Eastern Commission,and the French, Russian, Chinese (Nationalist), Netherlands, Burmese andPhilippine Governments. These discussions were initiated by the United StatesGovernment who have taken them up with the Governments enumerated above ona bilateral, basis although, so far as Commonwealth Governments are concerned,there has been close consultation between us for over three years on this subject and Commonwealth officials have been pooling their ideas in New York in the lasttwo months.2. It is not yet known when negotiations will begin. We know that the americans have prepared a draft treaty, but they have not yet shown it to us. TheState Department at one time seemed to expect that discussions would take a year or a year and a half. It is, however, possible that the situation in the Far East may give a great impetus to these discussions. For this reason it is necessary for us tobe prepared. Officials have done a great deal of useful work but are unable to make further progress without Ministerial direction on certain points which are set out below.3. There is further reason for considering Japanese problems now. Thesubject is to be considered at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conference, andit is therefore important that we should be clear in advance on our policy andattitude..4. It will be recalled that on 29th July, 1947, the Overseas reconstruction committee approved a series of papers (O.R.C. (47) 33-40 inclusive) setting out HisMajesty&apos;s Governmenfs attitude on almost every aspect of a Japanese Peace Settle-ment. These papers were used as briefs by the United Kingdom Delegation tothe Canberra Conference. Ministerial direction is now sought in this paper on those points on which decisions taken in 1947 (whether subsequently modified ornot) appear to require reconsideration, and upon new points which have arisen inthe last three years.5. The points on which decisions are now required are set out in paragraph 7below. It will be observed, however, that three very important questions affectingHis Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude toward the future of Japan do not figure inparagraph 1, namely, security (including possible Japanese rearmament), our policy towards Japanese trade and claims in respect of property damage and personal injury and ill-treatment arising out of the war. The security aspects of a japanese peace Treaty are the subject of a separate paper. My recommendations inparagraph 8 below proceed on the assumption that the recommendations in thepaper on Security will be approved. The two points in that paper of most import-ance with regard to the subjects now under consideration are that first, the possessionand building of merchant fleets and civil air fleets cannot be denied to Japan on purely strategic grounds, and second, that it would be politically undesirable, and
militarily unacceptable to set up any machinery within Japan to enforce defence orother restrictions imposed by the Peace Treaty. The question of our future trade policy toward Japan is under consideration, but it has not yet been found possibleto submit a comprehensive recommendation on this subject. My recommendations in paragraph 8 below, however, take full note of the decision of the 21st Meetingof the Economic Policy Committee on 15th September, E.P.C. (50) 21st MeetingMinute 1 (3), that His Majesty&apos;s Government must retain its freedom to protectUnited Kingdom industries against Japanese competition should the necessity arise.Owing to its importance, the question of claims is being considered separately.6.   I attach a background paper as Annex A.7. Points for decision(a) What should be the major objective of the Peace Treaty?(b) What should be the Peace Treaty&apos;s provisions concerning:(1) Disposal of Japan&apos;s former possessions: Korea, the Ryukyu, the Bonin,the Kurile and the Pescadores Islands, Formosa and South Sakhalin,her pre-war mandates, her pre-war interests in China and her claims inthe Antarctic continent? and(2) Political Matters.(c) Whether, and if so what, economic security controls should be imposedupon Japan?(d) What reparations can and should be exacted from Japan?(e) What provision should be made for the protection of foreign nationals andforeign interests in Japan?(/) What provision should be made in the Treaty concerning Japanese shipping and shipbuilding?(g) What provision should be made in the Treaty concerning Japanese civilaviation?(h) Whether provision should be made in the Treaty, or outside it, for the regulation of fishing and fishing grounds in the Far East?(0 What attitude should be adopted toward a suggestion that a Human RightsClause should be inserted in- the Treaty?(j) Whether, and if so what, steps should be taken to secure the dissolution ofthe Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan after the peace treaty comes into force?(k) To what extent should note be taken in the Treaty of Japanese legislationenacted during the Occupation period?(/) What attitude should be adopted toward the termination or revival of japan&apos;s membership of international agreements to which she was formerly a party,and toward her membership of other international organisations and toward the revival of pre-war bilateral treaties with Japan?(m) What attitude should be adopted towards Japan&apos;s becoming a member ofthe United Nations after a Peace Treaty has come into force?(n) What provision should be made for the settlement of disputes arising outof the Peace Treaty?(o) What attitude should be adopted toward the participation of the central people&apos;s Government of China in the Peace Treaty discussions?8. recommendations i invite my colleagues to agree that with regard to the questions set out inparagraph 7 above:  (a) His Majesty&apos;s Governments major object in the Peace Treaty discussions should be to secure a treaty which will permit the development of a peace-lovingJapan with a viable economy.(b) (i) Japan should recognise the independence of Korea.(ii) The Ryukyu and Bonin Islands should be placed under a United Statestrusteeship.(iii) As provided in the Livadia Agreement (Yalta), South Sakhalin and theKurile Islands should be ceded by Japan to the U.S.S.R.(iv) The decision of the United Nations or any other agreed decision on thefuture status of Formosa and the Pescadores Islands should, if possible,be incorporated in the Treaty.(v) Japan should renounce all special rights and interests in China.
(vi) Japan should renounce all political and territorial claims, whether actual or prospective, in the Antarctic continent and the islands adjacentthereto.(yii) Japan should specifically renounce all her rights and claims in respectof her pre-war mandated territories,(viii) The Japanese Government should undertake to prevent the resurgenceof undesirable political societies.   These would have to be suitablydefined.(ix) A reference to the responsibility of the Japanese militarist regime for having provoked a state of war, in terms similar to those used in theItalian Peace Treaty, should be included in the Preamble.(x) An obligation should be laid upon the Japanese Government toensure that, subject to normal remissions for good conduct, war criminals in Japan sentenced to terms of imprisonment before the peace treaty should serve the prison terms to which they were sentenced by war Crimes Courts.(c) No security controls should be irnposed upon Japan in the Peace Treaty,but His Majesty&apos;s Government should, in consultation with interested Governments,attempt to arrive at an understanding, separately from the Peace Treaty, to keep a close watch over Japanese imports of a small and carefully selected list of strategic materials which would be vital to Japanese war industry.(d) It was agreed when the brief for United Kingdom Delegation to ColomboConference of Foreign Ministers (SAC. (49) 18) was considered, that no furtherreparations should be exacted from Japanese industrial assets. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should, however, press for the stocks of Japanese (monetary) gold,under the control of the Supreme Commander in Japan to be made available as reparations. It must, however, be recognised that such a suggestion will be strongly resisted by the United States Government.Japanese overseas assets (both official and private) should in no circumstances be returned to Japan or to their Japanese owners. Japanese assets in allied countries should be at the disposal of the Governments of those countries. japanese assets in neutral and ex-enemy countries and in Germany and Austria are in most cases under the joint control of the representatives of China, the U.S.S.R., theUnited States and the United Kingdom on behalf of the Far Eastern Commission.However, the only practical way of making these assets available at all wouldbe to propose that they should be liquidated and divided amongst those of the fourcontrolling powers for Japanese official assets represented in those countries.(e) His Majesty&apos;s Government should press for the inclusion in the Peace Treatyof a clause providing that, pending the conclusion of establishment treaties between individual signatory States and Japan foreign nationals and companies in Japan will in all respects be given national and Most-Favoured-Nation treatment subjectif necessary to reciprocity. Any undertaking that national and Most-Favoured-Nation treatment by Japan would be subject to reciprocity would be on the under-standing that particular Colonial Governments would not themselves be committed to give national and Most-Favoured-Nation treatment to Japanese interests in orderthat the United Kingdom or other Colonies might benefit from the provision.(/) His Majesty&apos;s Government should press for Japanese shipbuilding capacity in excess of an agreed tonnage to be destroyed though it must be borne in mind that this suggestion may meet with strong United States opposition. Japan should,pending the negotiation of suitable agreements, grant in the Peace Treaty national and Most-Favoured-Nation treatment to the shipping of signatory States, if neces-sary subject to reciprocity. The same limitation would apply in respect of colonial territories as is set out in sub-paragraph 8 (e) above.(g) Pending the conclusion of civil air transport agreements with other signatory States, Japan should unilaterally undertake to extend to them the same,or not less favourable, air traffic rights and privileges as they enjoyed immediately before the Peace Treaty came into force. Pending the conclusion of such agree-ments, Japan should also grant to the international air lines of signatory Statesnational and Most-Favoured-Nation treatment subject, if necessary, to reciprocity.The same limitations would apply in the part of Colonial territories as is set out in sub-paragraphs 8 (e) above.(h) The Governments of Australia and New Zealand, and the Colonial Govern-ments of the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo, and HongKong have a major interest in the conclusion of a Fisheries Convention to regulate
fishing and fishing grounds in Far Eastern waters. The Australian and New zealand governments should be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that theinitiative in discussing such a Convention should be taken by them in close consul-tation with His Majesty&apos;s Government. They should also be informed generallyof the views set out in paragraphs 40-43 in the background paper annexed.(/) His Majesty&apos;s Government should not press for the insertion of a human rights clause in the Japanese Peace Treaty, but, if such a suggestion is made, theyshould not oppose it if there is strong support for such a clause. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might propose, as an alternative to. this suggestion, that a reference 1might be made in the Preamble to the Treaty to the signatories&apos; desire that japan would, of her own free will, accept the principles of .the Universal Declaration of human Rights.(/) No provision need be made in the Peace Treaty for the dissolution, of theFar Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan which were set up inpursuance of agreement reached at the Conference of Foreign Ministers in moscow in 1945.(k) It is undesirable that the Japanese Government should be required in thePeace Treaty to maintain unamended (indefinitely, or for a period of years) legisla-tion enacted by the Japanese Diet in a democratic manner since the beginning of theOccupation. Special ordinances issued by the Japanese Government in compliance with the orders of the Supreme Commander should be examined to see whethernote should be taken of them in the Peace Treaty.(if) Japan should be required in the Peace Treaty to renounce her rights under or to withdraw from such agreements or institutions as the Congo Basin Treaties,the Bank for International Settlements, the Treaty of Lausanne, and the StraitsAgreement of Montreux. She should also renounce all special rights of the JapaneseState in respect of the mandate system.Japan should give an undertaking in the Treaty to accede to the InternationalNarcotics Convention and the International Whaling Convention and any others which further study may show to be necessary.Provision should be made in the Treaty for the revival of non-political pre-warbilateral treaties, not by mutual consent, but on the initiative only of the Alliedsignatory State concerned.(m) No mention should be made in the Peace Treaty of Japan&apos;s becoming amember of the United Nations. However, His Majesty&apos;s Government should notrefuse to contemplate Japan&apos;s admission to the United Nations after the peace treaty is in force, or refuse to support her application for membership if it is made.(n) Claims and disputes arising out of the Peace Treaty should be settled by aspecial neutral tribunal to be set up by the President of the International Court ofJustice, and other disputes arising out of the Treaty should be referred, either todiplomatic settlement, or to the International Court of Justice.(o) It is desirable that at an appropriate stage, before a formal Peace Confer-ence is called, an invitation to take part in the Peace Treaty negotiations should beextended to the Central People&apos;s Government of China. An approach in this senseto United States Government at present would be inopportune, but the importanceof doing so in the future should be borne in mind.*E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,19^ December, 1950.ANNEX a background PAPERPart L-Summary of Existing Policy of His Majesty&apos;s government year ago Ministers approved a brief (SAG. (49) 18) for the Conference atColombo of the Foreign Ministers of the Commonwealth. This brief statedHis Majesty&apos;s Government^ general approach to a Japanese Peace Treaty, in light of what was then known of the United States Government^ views. Thebrief contained some modifications of the views expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment at the Canberra Conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in the
summer of 1947.   The-general position..approved by Ministers last, year was asfollows:   - . - .  , , , j ., - \ -     &apos;(a) The parties principal to the Peace Treaty should be the countries^, on the.Far Eastern Commission, plus Ceylon and Indonesia.(b) It was recognised that on security matters considerable weight had to, begiven to the views of the United States Government, which was mainly responsiblefor security in the Far East. It was known that  the United States Government didnot favour the prohibition by the Peace Treaty of war industries in Japan since theyhad been largely destroyed. The United States Government was unlikely to favourcontrol of Japan&apos;s war supporting industries (which were essential to her peace-timeeconomy) or of Japanese emigration. If we were prepared to accept the UnitedStates government judgment on Far Eastern security (and in view of our ownWeakness there we had no alternative), it was recognised that it would be difficult tocontest these views.(c) If American views on security in general were accepted it was clear thatno control enforcement machinery of the kind contemplated at Canberra in 1947could be established in Japan. It was thought however that adequate guaranteesagainst future Japanese aggression would be obtained if agreement could be reached between the signatory Governments to operate long-range economic and financial controls directed against Japanese imports.(d) It was decided that some reduction of Japanese shipbuilding capacitywas desirable. Although there was little chance of obtaining the agreement ofthe United States Government, it was agreed that we should press them to destroyJapanese shipbuilding capacity above a prescribed limit.(e) It was agreed that it would.be unrealistic to contest the American viewthat reparations from industrial assets should be regarded as a dead issue.(/) But it was not accepted that His Majesty&apos;s Government should abandon their claim to Japanese gold. We should resist the American claim to use Japanesegold to pay occupation costs. It was also considered that we had a special claimto Japanese balances in Switzerland, since they were built up largely from pay-ments made by His Majesty&apos;s Government through the Red Cross for the relief of British prisoners of war.(g) It was thought that there was nothing incompatible with the known viewsof the United States Government in the existing policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment concerning establishment, commerce, industry, snipping. This was that weshould endeavour to secure unilateral undertakings by Japan to grant us themaximum rights and privileges normally covered by Treaties of commerce,establishment and navigation. It was also considered that the United StatesGovernment would probably agree with the general argument reached at theCanberra Conference for curbing unfair Japanese trade competition and on thepolitical, territorial and general provisions of the Peace Treaty with Japan.Part II.-The Colombo Conference of January 19502. The Conference of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers at Colombo showed that differences of opinion existed between members of the Commonwealth asregards some of the provisions of a Japanese Peace Treaty, and that there weredifferences in emphasis on other points. The most important difference of opinionarose over the security provisions of the peace settlement between the australian and New Zealand Governments on the one hand and the rest of the commonwealth governments on the other. Australia and New Zealand were naturally anxiousconcerning the possibility of future Japanese aggression. They wished to maintainthe view generally accepted at Canberra in 1947 that control machinery should beset up within Japan in addition to long-range economic controls and they wanted to include in the Peace Treaty restrictions upon Japanese emigration. The other commonwealth Governments were inclined to accept the United Kingdom viewthat in view of the attitude of the United States Government, long-range economic controls were the best method available of preventing future Japanese expansion.It was therefore agreed that problems concerning Japan should be examined more fully by a Commonwealth Working Party.3. The Working Party held a series of meetings in May. Its report (C.M.J.(50) 8) revealed that although a good deal of agreement was reached, there still* Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, U.S.S.R.,United Kingdom, United States, Pakistan, Burma.
remained some points of difference. The main differences which persisted afterthe Working Party&apos;s meetings were over security provisions and the future of theJapanese economy. .Part III. Initiation by United States Government of Preliminary Conversationon a Japanese Peace Treaty4. On 22nd September, Mr. Dulles handed to the United Kingdom Delega-tion at New York a brief memorandum setting out the tentative views of the UnitedStates Government on the contents of a Japanese Peace Treaty. The United StatesGovernment propose a liberal peace which would give the Japanese the maximumopportunity to achieve a self-supporting economy and would free them from nearly all controls. The United States Government do not appear to consider japanese aggression in the future to be a serious danger..5: They propose that any or all nations at war with Japan which are willingto make peace on a basis to be agreed, shall be parties to the Treaty (it appearsthat at this stage the United States Government interpret their suggestion to mean the member countries of the Far Eastern Commission). Japan would recognise the independence of Korea, agree to United States trusteeship of the Ryukyu andBonin Islands, and accept the decision of the United States, United Kingdom,Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and China on the status of Formosa, thePescadores, South Sakhalin and the Kuriles. The Treaty would contemplate that pending other arrangements, Japanese security would be maintained by &quot;co-operative responsibility between Japanese facilities and United States, and perhapsother forces.&quot; Japan would adhere to multilateral treaties dealing with narcoticsand fishing, and pre-war bilateral treaties could be revived by mutual agreement.Pending new commercial treaties, Japan would extend Most-Favoured-Nation treat-ment subject to the usual exceptions. The signatory Powers should agree to waiveall claims arising out of &quot;war acts&quot; prior to 2nd September, 1945, except thatthe Japanese Government should meet claims arising out of damage to Alliedproperty in Japan. Further the Allies would in general dispose as they wishedof Japanese property within their jurisdiction..6. These tentative American proposals were published by the Russians on24th November together with a Russian aide-memoire asking for further elucidation.7. We, too, have asked the Americans to give us a more detailed expression oftheir views. We have not replied to their memorandum because as will be recalledwe had already given them an edited version of the report of the CommonwealthWorking Party upon which we sought their comments. We have not yet receivedany detailed expression of American views.8. The situation in the Far East and the Korean war may to some extentaccount for the slowness of the United States authorities in giving us a firmerexpression of their views. It is certain that some weeks ago the United StatesDepartment of the Army did not wish to see any definite progress made in the peace treaty discussions at New York until a successful conclusion to the Korean war was assured. However, the possibility cannot be disregarded that the United StatesGovernment may suddenly confront us with proposals for a Japanese Peace treaty or for such relaxations of occupation controls in Japan as would give the JapaneseGovernment their sovereignty in all but name.9. In these circumstances it appears desirable that Ministers should considerthe general attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government intends to adopt towards theJapanese Peace Treaty particularly because there are still differences of view amongstCommonwealth Governments. It is hoped that the forthcoming conference of commonwealth Prime Ministers will enable the United Kingdom to give theCommonwealth a lead.Part IV.-Consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Governments Policy toward a japanese peace Treaty10. The questions which.appear to require consideration in the light of what has been said above, are discussed in the paragraphs which follow. The two mostimportant problems affecting His Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude toward the future
oi Japan are security (including possible Japanese rearmament); and our policy towards Japan on shipping, air navigation, establishment and commercial matters(including Most-Favoured-Nation treatment for Japanese goods). The securityaspects of a Japanese Peace Treaty are the subject of a separate paper. However,the paragraphs below proceed on the assumption that the recommendations in thepaper on Security will be approved. The two points in that paper of mostimportance with regard to the subjects now under consideration are that first, the possession and building of merchant fleets and civil air fleets cannot be denied to japan on purely strategic grounds, and second, that it would be politically unde-undesirable and militarily unacceptable to set up any machinery within Japan to enforcedefence or other restrictions imposed by the Peace Treaty.11. It has not yet been found possible to submit a comprehensive paper on our attitude on all commercial matters. In the paragraphs which follow, however, notehas been taken of the decision of the 21st Meeting of the Economic PolicyCommittee of 15th September E.P.C. (50) 21st Meeting, Minute 1 (3) that we mustretain our freedom to protect our industries against Japanese competition, shouldthe necessity arise.Territorial and Political ProvisionsTerritorial Clauses12. As stated in the. Cairo Declaration of 1943, and the Livadia Agreement(Yalta) of February 1945 Japanese sovereignty should be confined to the four mainislands and to a number of adjacent minor islands to hedefined in the Treaty. Inaddition to a general renunciation by Japan of all claims to all the territories ofwhich she is to be deprived, the following should be recorded in the Treaty: -(a) Japan should recognise the independence of Korea.(b) If it is at all possible, agreement should be recorded in the Treaty that theRyukyu and Bonin Islands should be placed under a United Statestrusteeship.(c) In conformity with the Livadia Agreement, Japan should renounce sove-reignty and all her rights in and claims to South Sakhalin and the KurileIslands in favour of the U.S.S.R.(d) The Treaty should, if possible, contain the decision of the United Nations- Organisation or some other agreed decision on the eventual disposal of formosa and the Pescadores Islands.&apos;(e) Japan should renounce all special rights and interests in China.(/) Japan should renounce all political and territorial claims, Whether actual orprospective, in the Antarctic Continent and the islands adjacent thereto.(g) Japan should specifically renounce all her rights in and claims to her pre-war mandated territories.Political Provisions .....\.13. It is submitted that His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy toward theJapanese peace settlement should be to ensure that the Treaty secures the followingbroad objectives:  (a) The development of a peace-loving Japan which will have no desire tomenace other nations.(b) The development by Japan of a viable economy, which will provide a reasonably high standard of living for her population. ;*His Majesty&apos;s Government have consistently held that, after the period, of occupa-tion, no controls should be imposed upon Japan except those required for security,and that no proposal for restricting Japan&apos;s commercial and industrial activityshould be advocated.14. With the above criteria in mind, it is suggested that the political clauses inthe Japanese Peace Treaty should be kept to a minimum. The decision at theCanberra Conference that &quot; the Treaty should embody the fundamental democratic principles and obligations broadly prescribed in the Potsdam Declaration &quot; would now seem to require reconsideration. As was generally agreed by the Common-wealth Working Party on the Japanese Peace Treaty (CP. (50) 160), the treaty should not impose on the Japanese an obligation to maintain in perpetuity theirpresent constitution which came into effect in 1947. There might, however, be some advantage if the Treaty contained some general declaration of Japan&apos;s intention to
act in accordance with the fundamental principles set out. in . her present constitution.&apos; , - &apos; -  ... -1.15. It is considered, however, that, as recommended in paragraph 47 of theCommonwealth Working Party&apos;s Report (CP. (50) 160) the following three pro-visions should be inserted in the Treaty:- r(a) The Japanese Government should undertake to prevent the resurgence ofr L ; undesirable political societies. These would have to be suitably defined.(by A reference to responsibility of the Japanese militarised regime for havingprovoked a state of war, in terms similar to those used in the ItalianPeace Treaty, should be included in the Preamble. ri1. (c) An obligation should be laid upon the Japanese Government to ensure that,subject to normal remissions for good conduct, war criminals in Japansentenced to terms of imprisonment before the Peace Treaty should serve the prison terms to which they were sentenced by War CrimesCourts.Long-range Economic Controls16. Paragraph 22 of the Report of the Commonwealth Working Party on theJapanese Peace Treaty (CP. (50) 160) stated that the United Kingdom Government,in general, &quot; was now inclined to the view that the possibility of Japanese aggressioncould be adequately guarded against by long-range economic controls which wouldbe operated under an international agreement negotiated outside the (Peace)Treaty.&quot; It was suggested that this agreement, the parties to which might be a few of the major signatory States, should contain provisions requiring its members to watch a very short list of vital Japanese strategic imports. Member governments would be prepared to take action at short notice if it became clear that Japan wasill-disposed toward the democracies and was clearly building up substantial stocksof warlike or potentially warlike stores.17. It is assumed that neither Russia nor China would be prepared to partici-pate in such an agreement, and it is recognised that these two countries might beable and willing to supply certain strategic materials to Japan which the democracieswere anxious to withhold.18.. The United States Governments opinion of this suggestion is not yet known. It is believed, however, that they consider the enforcement, on an inter-national basis, of measures designed to prevent the possibility of renewed japanese aggression to be now to a large extent unnecessary. The United States Governmentis in fact considering at least a partial rearmament of Japan. Nevertheless this is as yet no indication that the United States Government would refuse out of hand toconsider an agreement of this kind.19. The Governments of Australia and New Zealand are known to be particu-larly nervous of the possibility of future Japanese aggression. It must be admitted that although, as Was stated in the Colombo brief; &quot; Japan by her own unaidedefforts is unlikely again to present a serious threat to security .... in so far as it relates to the short-term,&quot; the situation may be very different after another genera-tion, particularly if the Peace Treaty does not prohibit Japan from rearming to someextent. .20. It is suggested therefore that, with the agreement of the Governments ofAustralia, New Zealand and Canada, an approach should be made to the UnitedStates Government-asking them to consider joining with us, and possibly one or two other interested Powers, in an agreement to watch a very short list of vital Japanesestrategic imports. The list might, for example, include oil, rubber and bauxite, but clearly this will require further detailed study. It will be important, however, tomake sure that the materials in the list are such that it would not be difficult toobtain information of the amounts of each which Japan was importing. The agree-ment should provide machinery for the regular collection of statistics about such imports and also for some form of consultation in case of necessity between the signatory Governments.:,; 21. It is recognised that the effectiveness of such an agreement would depend upon the willingness of the signatory Governments to take action at short notice.It would probably be important to ensure that this agreement was negotiated, ifpossible, by the time the Peace Treaty is signed.  The longer its negotiation! is
delayed, the less enthusiasm there is likely to be for it. However, once such anagreement is in being, it will have the effect of facing member States with thenecessity of taking decisions of some kind as soon as there is evidence that japan is building up stocks of war material.22. It is important to remember, however, that Article 102 of the united nations Charter would require such an agreement (as opposed to a generalexpression of intention) to be registered and published. This might well affect theattitude of the United States Government. It is therefore suggested that, whenhis proposal is put to Commonwealth Governments, they should be informed thatan agreement of this kind would have to be made public, and also that, if it were intended to keep it confidential, it could only be in the form of some generalexpression of intention which would not be binding under international law.Reparations23. As stated in paragraph 1 (e) above, Ministers have already agreed(S.A.C. (50) 18) that it would be unrealistic to contest the American view that payment of reparation from Japanese industrial assets is now a dead issue. Thereremain, however, the possibilities of securing some comparatively small amountsfrom the stock of monetary gold, now held by the Supreme Commander in Tokyo,and from Japanese overseas assets.Japanese (Monetary) Gold24. The United States Government has as yet made no definite statementof its views on the disposal of the gold (valued at about  60 million sterling) underthe control of the Supreme Commander in Japan. It is likely, however, that theywill resist any suggestion that it should be made available as reparations.25. It seems not unlikely that they may use one or some of the followingarguments to support their case. First they may argue that this gold should beused for the payment of occupation costs. This is, however, not a very strong arguement and they may therefore contend that since with the approval of theFar Eastern Commission a large proportion of the value of the gold has beenpledged as security for loans to the Japanese Government by United States banks,it should be handed over to the Japanese Government to enable it to meet its obligations. The most probable line of American argument however is that thegold should be returned to the Japanese Government to be used as currencybacking. The United States Government is likely to contend that a stableJapanese currency after the Peace Treaty would be to the advantage of everyoneand that, to the extent that bullion is taken out of Japan, her currency will be lessstable.26. The Commonwealth Working Party on the Japanese Peace Treatyrecommended that any United States proposal to use this gold for the paymentof occupation costs or as backing for Japanese currency should be resisted. It is submitted therefore that we should state our case to the United States Governmentand say that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not be asked to sacrifice what itregards as its due in order to give Japan an appreciably better start as a freecountry than the victims of her aggression in the late war. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could in any case receive only a share of some  60 million, which by anystandard can be regarded as no more than token compensation for the damageinflicted by the Japanese in British possessions in the Far East, not to mention the territory of other allied Powers. In spite of this, however, it would be dangerous to assume that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not be subjected to very strong pressure (possibly overwhelming pressure) by the United States to renounceits claim to receive some reparations in gold.Japanese Overseas Assets27. As regards Japanese overseas assets, the United States Government hasalready liquidated all Japanese assets in its territories and used them to pay compensation to American nationals who were imprisoned or interned or whose property was lost or damaged by Japanese action during the war. The UnitedStates Government appears to assume that the other parties to the Japanese peace treaty will dispose of Japanese assets in their territories as they think fit. It is submitted that this view should be accepted. (The nett value of Japanese assets in the United Kingdom is between  1 million and  !  million.)
28. The United States view in regard to the disposal of Japanese assets in neutral and ex-enemy countries and in Germany and Austria is not known. Thenett value of these assets is not great except in Sweden and Switzerland. HisMajesty&apos;s Government has already been approached by the Swedish Government,who have asked for some portion of the Japanese assets under our control to be paidto them to meet their expenses in repatriating Japanese Embassy staff and looking after Japanese interests in Sweden at the end of the war. Japanese assets in Switzer-land probably amount to some 15^ million Swiss francs, of which it is consideredthat the Swiss Government^ claim of 2\ million Swiss francs for expenses is justified. Of the balance His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that they have aspecial prior claim to that part of the amount which is made up of money whichwas remitted by His Majesty&apos;s Government to Switzerland during the war for distribution by the Red Cross for the relief of British prisoners of war in Japanesehands and which had not reached its ultimate destination when hostilities ended.29. To date His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken the view that all Japaneseoverseas assets (both official and private) should be liquidated and put into ageneral reparations pool which would be divided by agreement amongst thecountries which are members of the Far Eastern Commission. It now appears,however, that it may be difficult to continue, to maintain this view. Russia and china have already appropriated large quantities of Japanese property in Man-churia and in China and Formosa the value of which they are most unlikely tomake available to any general pool, though they will not be slow in demandinga share of any pool that may come into existence. Further, Japanese official andmost private assets in neutral and ex-enemy countries and in Germany and Austriaare in most cases under the joint control of the representatives there of the Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics, China, the United States of America and the UnitedKingdom on behalf of the member states of the Far Eastern Commission. Unlessagreement amongst these four Powers can be secured on the method of then-disposal, the assets cannot be touched. Probably, therefore, the only practicalway of ensuring that these assets are not frozen indefinitely would be to seek agreement for their division amongst those of the four Powers represented in eachneutral country.30. This proposal, which is admittedly dictated by expediency, may meet with opposition. It is probably the only solution to which the Union of Soviet socialist republics and China could possibly be induced to agree. The United Kingdommay, therefore, have to consider at some stage making available some part of its share of these assets to Commonwealth countries should they be considered tohave good claims.31. It is submitted, however, that in the Peace Treaty the only provision onwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government should insist as regards Japanese overseas assets,is that they should in no circumstances be returned to the Japanese Government or their former Japanese owners.Establishment (Treatment of Foreign Nationals and Companies)32. At the Canberra Conference it was considered that the Japanese Govern-ment should in the Peace Treaty undertake to accord to aliens in Japan treatmentnot less favourable than is accorded to those aliens in their own countries. It is submitted however, that to attempt to write such a unilateral obligation into thePeace Treaty would be unwise, since it would certainly be strongly resented by theJapanese on the ground that it was inconsistent with their sovereign status. it follows, therefore, that, in any agreement which might be negotiated with Japanafter the Peace Treaty, she would be most unlikely to agree to the grant of a morethan &quot; national &quot; treatment to British Subjects or citizens of any other country.3.3. It is suggested therefore that His Majesty&apos;s Government should press forthe inclusion in the Treaty of a clause providing that foreign nationals in Japan will in all respects be given national and most-favoured-nation treatment thiswould, of course, also apply to foreign companies in all appropriate matters.We could agree if pressed to the exercise of these rights being subject to reciprocityin the sense that we should only get national and most-favoured-nation treatment in japan if we ourselves in practice accorded such treatment to Japan. In that event,it would have to be clearly understood that, as the treatment to be accorded to japanese interests within colonial territories is a matter for the Governments of those
territories and may vary as between territory and territory and as between the territories and the United Kingdom, the claim to national and most-favoured-nation treatment by the United Kingdom or particular colonial territories should not beinvalidated by the fact that not all territories accord such treatment to Japanese.The rights in Japan of persons &quot; belonging to &quot; any individual colony would be basedon the rights accorded to Japanese nationals (or companies) in that colony just asthe rights of persons belonging to the United Kingdom will be based on rightsaccorded to Japanese in the United Kingdom. There will, however, be some matters where by virtue of other clauses of the Treaty national treatment could not be accorded to Japan, e.g., in the United Kingdom Japanese ownership of certain types of property; for these particular matters the obligation to accord national treatmentby Japan must not be subject to reciprocity if it is to have any value. These pro-visions in the Treaty for national and most-favoured-nation treatment would be inforce pending the conclusion of Establishment Treaties covering these mattersbetween individual Governments and Japan.Shipping and Civil AviationShipping34. The Report of the Commonwealth Working Party on the Japanese peace treaty (CP. (50) 160) states that &quot; most Delegations were inclined to doubt the praticability and in some cases the desirability of imposing any restriction on the size and speed of ships built in Japan.&quot; Since, however, Japan&apos;s present merchantship building capacity is in excess of her normal peace-time needs (it was built upfor the purpose of constructing and servicing an inflated war-time fleet) &quot; the shear-ing away of Japan&apos;s present surplus capacity would be a reasonable proposal to advocate.&quot;35. It must be borne in mind, however, that it may not find favour with theUnited States Government in its present liberal mood. It is possible that the argu-ment advanced by both the British and the American shipbuilding industries whooppose the revival of Japan&apos;s shipbuilding industry on the ground that world ship-building capacity is greatly in excess of world demand for new ships, may have someeffect. Obviously it is economic common sense that, where possible, excess ship-building capacity which is not in use should be eliminated. In Germany shipbuilding capacity has been reduced by a reduction in major yards from 16 to 9. Further,there is no doubt that to leave Japan with her present very large shipbuilding capacity would be contrary to the economic interests of other shipbuildingcountries, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States. It is also possiblethat some concession by the Americans to the United Kingdom&apos;s view on Japaneseshipbuilding might assist them in their current attempt to induce Western european countries to restrict the construction of ships for export to Eastern Europe.36. However strongly the above case may be argued, such indications as wehave of American thinking show that it may not be acceptable to them. One ofthe strongest reasons put forward for the reduction of German shipbuilding capacitywas to deny it to a possible aggressor. United States thinking in regard to Japandoes not envisage, so far as we know, the successful over-running of the JapaneseIslands, but is concerned with their protection by every means including some measure of Japanese rearmament.37. Lastly, the Pacific is admittedly an American sphere of responsibility inglobal strategy, and the United States Government might well argue therefore that,if they were willing to risk Japan being left with her inflated shipbuilding capacity,we, who have no major responsibility in this sphere, can scarcely object to their doing so. It is submitted, however, that we should nevertheless suggest that Japan&apos;s ship-building capacity in excess of an agreed amount should be destroyed.38. As regards shipping relations with Japan, the United States Governmentappears to favour an undertaking being written into the Peace Treaty wherebyJapan pending the negotiation of suitable treaties would grant most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of shipping to those other signatory States who were preparedto reciprocate. This proposal appears to follow the precedent of Article 82 of theItalian Peace Treaty, and it is suggested that it is unobjectionable, provided that japan is bound to afford signatory states shipping &quot; national treatment &quot; as well as most-favoured-nation treatment, subject to reciprocity. Further it would be39816 e 2
necessary to ensure that any undertaking that national and most-favoured-nation treatment by Japan would be subject to reciprocity would be on the understandingthat particular Colonial Governments would not thereby be committed to givenational and most-favoured-nation treatment to Japanese interests in order that theUnited Kingdom or other Colonies might benefit from the provision. This isparticularly important in the case of those Colonies which were occupied by theJapanese, where anti-Japanese feeling is still so strong that the uncontrolled presenceof Japanese might well lead to disturbances, which we must do all in our power toavoid, especially in Hongkong and Malaya in present circumstances.39. It is suggested therefore that the Peace Treaty should contain clauses onthe following lines:  (a) Japan&apos;s shipbuilding capacity in excess of her normal requirements should either be destroyed or dismantled.(b) Japan would grant national and most-favoured-nation treatment in respectof shipping if necessary subject to reciprocity, to all the Allied signatoryStates, pending the conclusion of suitable treaties.Civil Aviation40. It is possible that some time after the Peace Treaty, Japan may be per-mitted to undertake the operation of international air services. Until she doe&amp;so itis submitted that she should grant freely and on a non-discriminatory basis to members of the United Nations air traffic rights and privileges in Japan for inter-national air services. She should also accept the requirement that, in makingbilateral agreements relating to international air transport, she should adopt apolicy of granting or exchanging air traffic rights on a liberal, and not on a restrictive,basis with those countries which are willing to accord the same treatment to her.The United Kingdom would not be willing to press for a clause prohibiting japan from subsidising her air lines when she is permitted to have them.41. It is suggested, therefore, that pending the conclusion of civil air transportagreements between the signatory States and Japan, the latter should undertake toextend to such signatory States the same or not less favourable air traffic rightsand privileges as they enjoyed before the Peace Treaty came into force. Further,that Japan should undertake, if necessary subject to reciprocity and pending theconclusion of bilateral air agreements, to grant national and most-favoured-nation treatment to international air lines or signatory States. Any undertaking that national and most-favoured-nation treatment by Japan would be subject to recipro-city would be on the understanding that particular Colonial Governments would notbe themselves committed to give national and most-favoured-nation treatment to japanese interests in order that the United Kingdom or other Colonies might benefit from the provision.Far Eastern Fisheries42. In the past the Japanese have been guilty of poaching, over-fishing and using their fishing fleets for intelligence purposes. It therefore seems desirable touse the opportunity of the Peace Treaty to restrain Japanese malpractices in future.However, unless specific clauses for the regulation of fishing and fishing grounds inFar Eastern waters can be agreed upon in time to be inserted in the Peace Treaty,it would seem that Japan could not be bound further than to give an undertaking,if called upon, to enter into international discussions with a view to concluding a far eastern Fisheries Convention. It is considered that a comprehensive Far EasternFisheries Convention of this kind would probably take two to three years tonegotiate. It is unlikely, therefore, that agreement on a draft could be obtainedamongst the interested countries before the Japanese Peace Treaty is signed. (Thepresumption is that the Treaty would be signed in about twelve months&apos; time.) Itmight, of course, be possible to obtain agreement within a year to certain principles which would be sufficiently specific to warrant their inclusion in the Peace Treaty.If not Japan could, as suggested above, be bound only to discuss a possibleConvention. .43. It is, however, for consideration whether such a Far Eastern FisheriesConvention might not be drawn up by the Food and Agricultural Organisation(F A O.), which is represented in the Far East by the Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council.Japan Would, of course, have to be elected to F.A.O. in the usual way, but a Far -astern Fisheries Convention under a ready-made international umbrella might be
preferable to negotiating a Convention by an ad hoc body whose members would inany case already be represented on the Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council. ;44. This question is of primary interest to countries in the Far East.The United Kingdom has ho special interest in Far Eastern Fisheries, though theGovernments of the Federation of Malaya, Sarawak, North Borneo, Hong; kong and Singapore would be much interested. The most important Commonwealthinterest is that of Australia and New Zealand.45. It is suggested that these views should be communicated to the Goyern-ments of Australia and New Zealand, mention being made of the interests of colonial Governments. It should be added that His Majesty&apos;s Government feelthat the initiative in the discussion of a Far Eastern Fisheries Convention shouldbe taken by Australia and New Zealand in close consultation with HisMajesty&apos;s Government. Further, the suggestion that the Convention might bedrawn up by the F.A.O. might be put to the Australian and New Zealand Govern-ments for an expression of their views, though it is recognised that their interest is primarily a security one which might not be adequately safeguarded in aninternational agency.Human Rights46. The Commonwealth Working Party (CP. (50) 160) considered theinclusion in the Treaty of a clause on human rights. It would be possible to requirethe Japanese Government to undertake some obligations concerning human rights in one of four ways:   .(a) By inserting in the Peace Treaty a clause which might be modelled on article 3 of the Roumanian Peace Treaty containing a brief general statement of the Japanese Governments obligation to secure human rights, freedom of expression, &amp;c, without distinction of race, sex,language or religion.(b) By inserting a clause by which the Japanese Government endorsed the universal Declaration of Human Rights approved by the general assembly of the United Nations on 10th December, 1948 (Command7662).(c) By a clause on the lines suggested by the Canadian Delegation to theCommonwealth Working Party on the Japanese Peace Treaty (seeparagraph 44 of the Working Party&apos;s Report).(d) By a clause requiring the Japanese to maintain and enforce the provisionsof the Japanese Constitution.47. (a) Experience with the Hungarian, Roumanian and Bulgarian peace treaties suggests than the first method (the insertion of a brief clause defining human rights) would give no real protection to persons whether aliens or Japanese mal-treated by the Japanese Government. It would give His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe other signatory Governments a valid legal basis for protesting, but if experience in Eastern Europe is any guide, the protests would be ineffective if the JapaneseGovernment chose to ignore them.(b) It is unlikely that the second method (the endorsement of the UniversalDeclaration) would be any more successful. The Japanese Government could just as easily ignore protests. The Universal Declaration is in any case not a legally enforceable document and the weight of public opinion which it does undoubtedlycarry would be more effective if at a later date Japan were to adopt its standardsvoluntarily.(c) The Canadian draft clause would not secure &quot; national&quot; treatment foraliens in Japan, does not define all the fundamental rights (e.g. the right to life) and does not define the limitations to be placed upon the rights it purports to grant:   :id) The Japanese Constitution contains provision for its own amendment byreferendum, and it would therefore seem objectionable to force the JapaneseGovernment to retain a part of it unamended in perpetuity. In all four cases itwould be difficult if not impossible to provide in the Treaty for any machinery which would ensure Japanese compliance with her undertakings. &apos;48. The case for inserting a human rights clause in the peace treaty is therefore that, though unenforceable, it might have a propaganda value, it might be insistedupon by the U.S.S.R., it would probably please the Americans and its omissionwould be difficult to justify.;
- 49. It is suggested therefore that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not press for the insertion of a human rights clause. However, if such a suggestion is madeon the lines of (a), (b) or (c) in paragraph 45 above, it is proposed that His Majesty^sGovernment should not oppose it if there is strong support for such a clause., 50. As an alternative to such a suggestion His Majesty&apos;s Government mightpropose that in the preamble to the Treaty a reference might be made to the signatories&apos; desire that Japan would of her own free will accept the principles ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan51. If either the U.S.S.R. or China is not a party to the Japanese peace treaty, there may be some difficulty in bringing about the formal dissolution ofthe Far Eastern Commission (F.E.C.) and the Allied Council for Japan (A.C.J.),which were established as a result of the Council of Foreign Ministers meetingat Moscow in December 1945.52. The terms of reference of the F.E.C. provide in Article VII that theCommission &quot; shall cease to function when a decision to that effect is taken bythe concurrence of at least a majority of all the representatives including the repre-sentatives of the four following Powers: United States, United Kingdom, Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics, and China.&quot; It seems clear that, unless circumstancesalter, the F.E..C. cannot be dissolved without the concurrence of the Soviet Govern-ment and the Chinese Nationalist Government. Nevertheless, a valid case fordissolution irrespective cf the provisions of Article VII and without the consentof the U.S.S.R. and China would probably develop if a state of peace came into being between Japan and most of the members of the F.E.C. This case would bethat, after a peace had come into effect, the Commission would have no functions to perform, since the occupation would be terminated, a circumstance not contem-plated at the time of drawing up its terms of reference.53.. The terms of reference of the Allied Council for Japan (A.C.J.) can be read as rendering it dependent upon the continued existence both of the F.E.C.and of the office of Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (S.C.A.P.). If,therefore, for example, the office of S.C.A.P. were to disappear (which it presumablywould if the occupation were to end), the Council would certainly become a dead,letter and could be ignored. There would seem to be no need, therefore, to provide in the Peace Treaty for the formal dissolution of the F.E.C. or of the A.C.J.The Extent to which Note should be taken in the Peace Treaty of JapaneseLegislation enacted under the Occupation other than the JapaneseConstitution54. Article 41 of the present Japanese Constitution states that &quot; the Dietshall be the highest organ of State power, and shall be the sole law-making authorityof the State.&quot; This body, which consists of two Houses, functions in a democraticmanner, and is well aware of its constitutional power and position. It would seemundesirable therefore to require the Japanese Government, by provisions in thePeace Treaty, to maintain, either for a term of years or in perpetuity, laws whichhave been passed by the Diet under the present Constitution, which came intoeffect on 2nd May, 1947. In may, however, after further study and consultationwith other Governments, be considered desirable that, in the Peace Treaty, japan should give a voluntary undertaking to act in accordance with the spirit of certainDiet laws which have brought about reforms e.g., the Land Reform Law, the TradeUnion Law and the Labour Standards Law. It is suggested, however, that it wouldbe undesirable to go further than this.55. In addition to ordinary laws, however, there exists at the present time in japan a very large body of extra-constitutional legislation. There are between 150and 200 ordinances and Cabinet orders promulgated by the Japanese government from time to time, under the powers taken by it by Imperial Ordinances No. 542 ofSeptember 1945 and No. 311 of 1946. These two ordinances were promulgated bythe Emperor to enable the Japanese Government quickly to issue orders having theforce of law to implement directives issued by the Supreme Commander.56. The majority of the ordinances issued by the Japanese Government in this manner repeal laws and ordinances governing the Army, mobilisation, munitions,
the use of land for State purposes, State Shinto, the thought-control police, andmany other laws in force at the time of the surrender, which gave the JapaneseGovernment the powers of a totalitarian dictatorship. Special ordinances of thiskind also provided for the Purge (de-Nazification). In short, these ordinances canyout the tasks imposed upon the Occupation forces in Japan by the Potsdam Declara-tion. These tasks were to occupy Japan, to eliminate the influence of those whohad led Japan to embark on a war for world conquest, to disarm the Japanese mili-tary forces and completely to destroy her capacity to make war.57. These special ordinances are in practice, therefore, an important part ofthe Japanese constitutional legal framework at the present time. Tney cleared theway for the promulgation of the 1947 Constitution. Since the Constitution came into effect, these ordinances have been issued in certain cases where either time didnot allow of the Diet passing appropriate laws, or discussion in the Diet was con-sidered undesirable by the Supreme Commander; e.g., an ordinance issued in April1949 imposing heavy penalties for the non-registration with the police of politicalsocieties. These ordinances cannot be amended or discussed by the Diet, and theCourts have no jurisdiction to consider their constitutionality, since they derive their authority from the fact of the Japanese surrender.58. In all probability the great majority of these ordinances will have ceased to be necessary by the time the Peace Treaty is signed, and might then be allowedto lapse, because most of the laws and ordinances which they repeal could not bere-enacted under the present Constitution. The special powers given to theJapanese Government by recent ordinances of this kind should, if the Governmentwishes to retain them, be embodied in laws passed by the Diet. However, theremay be some of the ordinances promulgated under the Occupation, such as thePurge ordinances which, for reasons of international security, the Allied Powers may consider should continue in force for a term of years after the Peace Treaty. Thissubject will require detailed study.International Agreements and Organisations59. It is desirable that Japan should be required in the Peace Treaty to with-draw from certain international agreements to which she was a party before thewar, and also that she should accede to certain other agreements and international organisations. There may also be bilateral agreements which she should be requiredeither to revive or to terminate.60. Of Bilateral Agreements and Treaties between Japan and nations withwhich she was at war, some, mainly political such as treaties of friendship andalliance, would be terminated by the war and cannot be revived. Others, of a non-political nature, such as commercial agreements, would be merely suspended by theoutbreak of hostilities and can be revived. Such, agreements do not, however, reviveautomatically, and it is usual for peace treaties to contain appropriate provisions for determing which of them shall be revived.61. Bilateral agreements with countries with which Japan was. no/ at warremained in force throughout the war, and will automatically be in force; after the signature of the Peace Treaty. If it is desired to oblige Japan to terminate such agreements, a provision must be inserted in the Peace Treaty instructing her to takethe steps necessary for denunciation. (The question whether we should wish japan to denounce any such treaties should receive further consideration.)62. Japan did not cease to be a party to multilateral treaties by reason of thewar, and she is still a party to them, although, owing to the fact that she does not enjoy sovereign rights, she is not at present able to exercise her rights or fulfil her obligations under them. As soon as a Peace Treaty has been signed, Japan cannotify to the other parties that she is again in a position to carry out her obligations under such treaties. Since the beginning of the war, however, some multilateraltreaties and conventions (such as the International Postal Convention) have been revised and special provision has, in some cases, been made for Japan&apos;s participa-tion. In cases where it is desired that Japan should accede to existing multilateraltreaties or join international organisations, the Treaty must lay upon her theobligation to take the necessary steps.63. It is suggested that provisions should be made in the Treaty for the revival of non-political bilateral treaties, not by mutual consent, but on the initiative only of the Allied signatory State.
64. It is suggested that Japan should be required to accede to orpin rn thefollowing multilateral agreements or organisations: the International NarcoticsAgreement, the International Whaling Convention and any others that further studymay show to be necessary. It is suggested that, inter alia, Japan should be requiredto renounce her rights under, or to withdraw from, the following treaties, agree-ments and organisations: the Congo Basin Treaties, the Bank for international settlements (this would involve legislation in Switzerland), the Treaty of Lausanneand the Straits Agreement of Montreux.65. Lastly, Japan should in the Peace Treaty renounce all special rights ofthe Japanese State in respect of the mandate system.Japanese Membership of the United Nations66. The Commonwealth Working Party on the Japanese Peace Treaty(CP. (50) 160) generally agreed that &quot;it would probably be desirable to avoid specific reference in the Treaty to sponsorship of Japan for membership of the united nations. This was, however, a matter which Commonwealth Governments mightlike to consider further.&quot; In the memorandum which Mr. John Foster Dulleshanded to Sir Esler Dening in New York on 22nd September, it was suggested that&quot;membership by Japan (of the United Nations) would be contemplated.&quot;67. It is suggested that, once a Peace Treaty is signed, the United kingdom would not, on general grounds, have any reason to oppose an application by Japanfor membership of the United Nations. On the contrary, there would probably be advantages in bringing Japan into the Organisation, where, in addition to certainprivileges, she would also be bound by obligations toward other States.68. It is submited, therefore, that we should maintain in the Peace treaty negotiations that no mention should be made in the Peace Treaty of Japan&apos;s membership of the United Nations. It is further suggested, however, that we shouldnot refuse to contemplate letting the Japanese Government know informally, afterthe Peace Treaty is signed, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would support Japan&apos;application for membership of the United Nations, if she decided to make one.Disputes69. In the memorandum which Mr. Dulles handed to Sir Esler Dening on22nd September (see paragraph 4 above) it was suggested that claims disputesshould be settled by a special neutral tribunal to be set up by the President of theInternational Court of Justice, and that other disputes should be referred either todiplomatic settlement or to the International Court of Justice. It is suggested thatthis proposal in principle be accepted.Procedure70. From reports from the United Kingdom Delegation to the United nations general Assembly at New York, it appears that the United States Governmentwishes, if possible, to conduct the major part of the negotiation of a Japanese peace treaty through the diplomatic channel, and to confine the participants to the member States of the Far Eastern Commission. Should the Central People&apos;sGovernment of China not have been recognised by the United States Governmentand should it not have become a member of the Far Eastern Commission by thetime active negotiations on the Japanese Peace Treaty begin, it would seem desirablethat an approach should be made to the United States Authorities asking them to invite the Central People&apos;s Government to take part in the Peace Treaty negotia-tions. It is not considered that any useful purpose would be served by an approach to the United States Government at the present time, particularly since they arealready aware of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs view at the official level from theCommonwealth Working Partys Report. However, the desirability of a requestin this sense being made to the United States Government at a later stage should it is submitted, be borne in mind.
