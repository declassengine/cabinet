DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(50) 27817TH NOVEMBER, 1950THE CASE OF THE REVEREND J.G. MA C MAN A W A YMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council,the Home Secretary and the Attorney-general it will be remembered that the Reverend J.G. MacManaway waselected to the present Parliament of the United Kingdom as the Member forBelfast West.    He is also, and has for some years been, a Member of the parliament of Northern Ireland.    After considering an advisory opinionfrom the Privy Council the House of Commons passed a resolution to theeffect that Mr. MacManaway was, and had always been, disabled from being elected or sitting as a Member by reason of the provisions of the House ofCommons (Clergy Disqualification) Act, 1801, he having been ordained aPriest.2. Section 18(2) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, providesthat the law for the time being in force relating to the disqualification ofMembers of the Commons House of the United Kingdom Parliament shallapply also to the Northern Ireland Parliament, and it is clear that theNorthern Ireland Parliament has no power to legislate as to the qualifica-tions for its membership.3. It has been suggested by the Attorney-General of Northern Irelandthat the Northern Ireland Parliament could not properly pass a resolutiondeclaring Mr. MacManaway disqualified and his seat vacant in the way thathas been done here, since they have no power to legislate on the subject ofParliamentary qualifications.     The Attorney-General considers there is absolutely nothing in this point.    There is, however, a further ground,slightly more substantial, which has resulted in the Commons House of theNorthern Ireland Parliament not having so far seen fit to follow the coursetaken by the Commons here and which makes the Government of NorthernIreland rftluctant to move their Commons so to do.    It is suggested that,whilst the law of the United Kingdom Parliament is clear, the effect of theHouse of Commons (Clergy Disqualifications) Act, 1801, may have been modified in its application to Northern Ireland by Section 5 of the Govern-ment of Ireland Act, 1920, a question not raised before the Privy Council inthe previous proceedings which related only to Mr. MacManaway&apos;s member-ship of the United Kingdom Parliament.    Section 5(1) of that Act prohibitsthe Irish Parliament from passing legislation interfering with religiousequality or creating an advantage or imposing a disability &quot;on accountof.....ecclesiastical status&quot;.     Section 5(2) is as follows:&quot;any existing enactment by which any penalty disadvantage ordisability is imposed on account of religious belief or on amember of any religious order as such shall from the appointed day, cease to have effect in Northern Ireland. &quot;COPY NO.    B 1CABINET

4. The Attorney-General considers that these provisions have nobearing upon the disqualification imposed by the Act of 1801.     He thinks that the object of Section 5 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, was toremove disabilities on account of religious belief or on account of membership of particular religious bodies, not on account ofecclesiastic status as such.    The Attorney-General of Northern Irelandagrees with this opinion, but he thinks the contrary view is just as arguableand points, in that view, to the use of the expression &quot;ecclesiasticalstatus&quot; in Section 5(1).5. As the matter cannot be regarded as conclusively settled either by the original opinion of the Judicial Committee or the advice of theLaw Officers and as there may be some slight risk that in the absence ofa Judicial finding a perverse House might refuse to accept a government motion declaring Mr. MacManaway disqualified, the Government ofNorthern Ireland have formally asked the United Kingdom Government thatthe Judicial Committee may be requested to give further advice as to the precise effect of Section 5 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.Whilst we hardly think that any uncertainty in the legal position isoufficient to justify such a course, we feel that as a matter of comity,the views of the Northern Ireland Government should be met.    We suggesttherefore that His Majesty should be asked to refer the matter to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council.6. The request to His Majesty might, no doubt, be made either ona prayer by the Commons of Northern Ireland to the Governor or by theNorthern Ireland Government through the Governor.    The NorthernIreland Government suggest, however, that the Government of the UnitedKingdom should move His Majesty for the necessary Order-in-Council.There is no need for any prayer by Parliament since under Section 4 ofthe Privy Council Act, 1833, His Majesty can refer any matter he thinks fit to the Judicial Committee for an opinion.     If the Cabinet agree to makethe request to His Majesty direct the Order-in-Council might perhapsrecite the fact that the reference was made at the request of the Govern-ment of Northern Ireland.7. If the matter is so referred, the Northern Ireland Governmentwill arrange for the preparation of the necessary case and for represen-tation by Counsel so that the two opposing views may be argued.     In themeantime it will be necessary to delay the presentation of the Billindemnifying Mr. MacManaway in respect of the penalties he incurred bysitting in the United Kingdom Parliament since, should the result be, aswe anticipate, to show that he had also incurred penalties in respect ofhis membership of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, it would also benecessary to include an indemnification in respect of this.8. Accordingly we recommend that His Majesty be asked to refer the point of law involved to the Judicial Committee of the Privy council for their opinion.H.M.J.C.E.H.W.S.17th November, 1950.
