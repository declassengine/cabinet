OSITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 2961ST DECEMBER, 1950COPY NO.   32CABINETCOAL EMERGENCY MEASURES:   OPENCASTMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerAnnexed for the information of the Cabinet is a report onopencast coal made to me by the Official Coal Committee.2. I am stire that in our present coal difficulties the Ministerof Agriculture and the Minister of Town and Country Planning willgive their full co-operation to secure both a rapid settlement of the sites that are awaiting clearance, and a sympathetic reconsideration of certain of the sites which up to now they have felt it necessary to   -oppose.3. I must add that the uncertainties of opencast production are such that two or three weeks of exceptionally bad weather may lose usa quarter of a million tons of opencast coal;   there can be no guarantee that we shall get another quarter of a million tons by the measures proposed.     Clearly, however, we must find sites at once for the small amount of plant now idle in order to add to our chances of increasingopencast output, or at all events maintaining it, if weather conditions should be adverse.     This is of particular importance, since power stations depend largely on opencast coal, and their present stocks areshort.P.J.N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power,S.W.I..1ST DECEMBER, 1950.

ANNEXOFFICIAL COAL COMMITTEEFIFTH REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN TO THEMINISTER OF FUEL AND POWEROPENCAST COALThe Committee make the following interim report on what might be done to increase opencast coal production this winter.     TheWorking Party set up by the Committee on opencast coal is continuingits consideration of longer term questions.     Copies of this Reporthave been sent to the Ministries   of Agriculture and Fisheries and of town and Country Planning, who were represented on the working party.2. Some increase of production might be obtained this winter-by securing the greatest possible acceleration of work on sites atpresent let on contract, and by increasing the number of sites fromwhich coal could be produced by the end of the winter.3. The first is a matter for the Ministry of Fuel and Power andwe note that the Ministry have arranged a special meeting of all theircoal contractors to impress on them the need to produce the maximumtonnage from existing sites this winter.4. On the second point, 15 sites are to be let in the next twomonths, which is twice as many as in last December and January.There is, however, a small amount (5-10%) of plant idle which could babsorbed if the number of sites could be increased by about 10.     the outside limit of the additional output which would thus be obtained woulbe some 250,000 tons.     There are 30 sites awaiting clearance and theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Town and country Planning have agreed to make a special effort to speed up thescases.     We recommend that in this -consideration, these Ministriesshould take full account of the urgent need to increase coal productionthis winter.5. There are several sites which have been rejected on amenityand agricultural grounds, but which could be fitted into the programmevery easily.     The Committee appreciate that the re-opening of somecases would involve a drastic change of policy towards agricultural ancamenity objections, and even possibly the breaking of understandingsreached limiting the parts of sites to be worked. We cannot at thisstage make any definite recommendations, and have asked the working party to investigate a few of the critical sites in order to prepare fullstatements for our consideration, and submission, if necessary, to ministers.(Signed)   E.N.
