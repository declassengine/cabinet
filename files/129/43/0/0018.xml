THIS   DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTUNITED KINGDOM CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNITED NATIONSFUND FOR KOREAN RECONSTRUCTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theChancellor of the exchequer in accordance with the request contained in the General Assembly&apos;s resolution on the unification and rehabilitation of Korea, the Economic and Social council are now engaged in drawing up a programme for Korean reconstruction. TheCouncil will shortly complete consideration of the administrative arrangements which shall govern this programme and are likely to recommend that these should follow the pattern set out in a draft resolution sponsored by Australia and theUnited States, a copy of which is attached at Annex A.2. The Economic and Social Council will next turn their attention to the financing of this programme, and the Minister of State has asked to be given instructions as soon as possible. Interim directions have been given. It is now necessary to decide what the United Kingdom contribution should be.Recommendation3. It is recommended that the Minister of State should be given discretion to offer a contribution of the order of  5 to  10 million. Our contribution shouldnot exceed the 11 - 37 per cent, of the total programme, which would represent our normal share on the United Nations scale of contributions. He should be asked tomake the offer as low as possible within this range, and to decide the final figure in the light of the contributions other Governments are prepared to make (under conditions described in more detail in paragraph 15 below). In no case should our contribution, including the value of materials already supplied, exceed  10 millionsterling.General considerations . In considering what the size of the United Kingdom contribution shouldbe, we must bear in mind the following considerations:  (a) It is of the utmost importance, if the will to resist of potential victims of aggression is to be sustained, that it should be shown that the united nations are not only willing to take collective action against aggression,but are also prepared to take collective action to repair the damage done as the result of such aggression.(6) It is also important, in order that the Cominform may not be able to argue that United Nations aid is merely a cloak for United States aid designedto secure a stranglehold on the Korean economy, that States other thanthe United States should subscribe a reasonably large proportion of thetotal sum.(c) At this moment, when world public opinion is focussed on Korea, it isimportant that the United Kingdom should not seem to be reluctant toprovide a fair share of the United Nations aid programme. This isparticularly important for its bearing on public opinion in the UnitedStates, which would be quick to resent any sign that other countriesdesire to leave almost the whole burden to the United States, and whichis likely to pay particular attention to the attitude of the UnitedKingdom./I printed for the Cabinet.

2id) On the other hand, in view of the burden of rearmament and the stresseslaid on the United Kingdom economy by this and other factors, wemust at present seek to limit our contribution to international pro-grammes of this kind as much as possible; and(e) We must be careful not to incur from our colonies, and from such countries as India which have a particular call on our resources, the reproach thatwe are prepared to do more for Korea than we are for them.Size of the total programme. A sub-committee of the Economic and Social Council have been takingevidence on the extent of Korean needs. They have received statements from the personal representative of the United Nations Secretary-Genera! in Korea(Colonel Katzin), from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of korea and from the Unified Command.6. The Secretary-GeneraFs representative suggested that the total cost of relief and rehabilitation would almost certainly exceed $500 million, and recom-mended that a sum of not less than $250 million should be envisaged as theminimum, &quot;budget&quot; for the first year. The Korean Minister for Foreign Affairsspoke in terms of total requirements for the whole recovery period of five and a half years of $2,064 million and of requirements of $286 million for the period25th June to 31st December, 1950, and $394 million for the period 1st January to31st December, 1951.7. The most detailed estimates were received from the Unified Command andthe sub-committee are decided to take them as the basis of their estimate ofKorean needs. The Unified Command were not prepared to make any estimateof the total needs for Korean reconstruction, but provided figures of import require-ments for the period 25th June, 1950, to 31st December, 1951. A detailed break-down of these figures is given at Annex B. They amount to a total of $364 million,of which only some $35 million is likely to be financed by the sale of Koreanexports, leaving a total of some $330 million to be covered by United Nationsrelief. Of this sum, $100 million might be spent in 1950 and the remaining$230 million in 1951.8. It would be very difficult to challenge these estimates which it is under-stood were prepared by the Mission of the Economic Co-operation Administra-tion in Korea and screened by the State Department before being presented to theUnited Nations. It would also be very difficult to provide for any independentcheck of them. They are therefore likely to be generally accepted as the target for the United Nations relief programme.Procedure for raising the money9. The United States delegation, supported by the Canadians, have proposed a &quot; mandatory &quot; method of assessing contributions, to be determined by vote of theAssembly and related to the normal scale of United Nations contributions. Themain objective of the Americans is stated to be to show up the Russians and theirsatellites, who will not wish, they think, to contribute. Our delegation have been unwilling to oppose the Americans because they feared to form a rallying point for those Who were anxious to do nothing. They have, however, been instructed toensure as far as possible that countries declaring their unwillingness to contributeshould not be allowed a voice in determining the size of the programme or thescale of contributions. They have also been instructed to do their best to secureAmerican acceptance of a method of contribution which will not commit HisMajesty&apos;s Government in regard to fixed percentages of unknown but large sums,will leave our hands free in regard to future contributions, will not frighten offpotential contributors from inside and outside the United Nations, and will safe-guard against extravagance the rate of drawing on individual contributions andon the whole sum. Wide discretion in regard to the method of determining con-tributions has, however had to be left to the Minister of State and the UnitedKingdom&apos;s delegation in New York, and it is in part for this reason that flexibilityis also required in regard to the size of the United Kingdom contribution.Size of the United Kingdom contribution10.   The United States representative on the Economic and Social Council isreported as having stated to the Australian delegate that the United States would
probably be prepared to provide the whole of the $100 million which it is recom-mended should be spent on Korean reconstruction in 1950 and 70 per cent, of a reduced programme of $200 million which he could accept, with reluctance, as anadequate programme for 1951. This would leave $60 million to be raised by theremaining contributors.11. It seems probable that the Cominform countries will refuse to make any contribution and, in view of their unsatisfactory attitude on the Korean question,Egypt and possibly one or two other Arab countries may also refuse to take part;while Chiang Kai Shek&apos;s Government is likely to be able to make only a tokencontribution. If, therefore, it should prove possible to fix contributions in relationto the balance of the programme remaining after the United States had made their offer, it would be necessary to adjust proportionately the normal United Nationsscale of contribution of those states other than the United States who were preparedto contribute. On such an adjustment the United Kingdom contribution would stand at between 26 and 27 per cent, of the balance, say, $16 million, or  5f million.12. There is likely, however, to be a strong feeling that the United Kingdomand the other richer countries should bear a greater proportion of the necessaryadjustment than the poorer countries. At the Technical Assistance Conference,held in June 1950, after the United States had agreed to bear 60 per cent, of whatever total was subscribed, the United Kingdom agreed to bear a similarpercentage of the total sum to that which we contribute to the United Nationsbudget (11-37 per cent.). If we were called upon to follow the same&quot; procedure in this case, our share of a programme of $200 million would be  8 million.American generosity in &quot; writing off &quot; the $100 million spent on the 1950 programme would relieve us of the necessity of envisaging a contribution of  12 or  13 million,such as a total programme of $300 million or $330 million would necessitate.13. Our colleagues will realise that further demands on the United kingdom economy at this time are very unwelcome and a contribution of this order can beprovided only in inconvertible sterling, the use of which by the Agent General forKorean Reconstruction would be subject to Treasury approval.14. We might, therefore, tell the Minister of State that, provided, as it issuggested, the United States agrees to bear the whole cost of the 1950 programme and to make a contribution of 70 per cent, to a programme of some $200 million to be spent in 1951, and provided that other countries are willing to contribute thebalance required to complete the total, we, in our turn, would be prepared to offer,in the first instance, the sum of  5 million (representing roughly twice our share ofthe balance required on our normal United Nations scale of contributions). If hardpressed with arguments such as those envisaged in paragraph 12 above, or if, alter-natively, there is difficulty about the United States carrying the whole burden ofthe 1950 expenses, the Minister of State may increase our offer to a maximum of 10 million, provided the figure in question can be presented as no more than ourproper share (11-37 per cent.) of a programme requiring fulfilment. This degreeof flexibility is necessary because of the large number of unknown factors; but themethod proposed will ensure that the principle to which Ministers have attached importance, of not undertaking to pay more than our proper share of United Nationsexpenses, is preserved. Any advance should, however, be made only if absolutely necessary, in consideration of the effect of such payments on the United kingdom economy and of the fact that every such increase may reduce the stimulus to othercontributors. In this we can expect to find an ally in the United States, whose aimis to spread the area of participation as widely as possible.15. Interim expenditure during 1950 on donations in kind for relief action in korea has already been authorised within a limit of  500,000. The question will arise in the United Nations whether such donations in kind should or should not beincluded in the monetary contributions to be made to the Fund. This is partly amatter of tactics and involves the question whether the programme to be consideredis to cover the year 1951 only or the period of eighteen months from July 1950. TheMinister of State might therefore be given discretion to decide in the light of circum-stances what action he should take in this matter, provided that he observes the absolute limit of  10 million, including the authorisation of  500,000 mentionedabove.E.

Homes. This category includes imported materials for both rural and urban houses estimated to have been damaged to the extent of 5 per cent, and temporary shelter which must be provided. It is estimated that during the first year of restoration that tentage, clothing, fuel. &amp;c, to the value in United Statesdollars of 7 million will be required to sustain the populace. Since considerablepreliminary work must be accomplished in clearing away destruction, &amp;c, it isestimated that only about $10 million worth of construction material can beconsumed in actual construction.2. Public Works and Services. Included in this category are: government buildings, schools, prisons, hospital and medical supplies. The damage to structuresin this instance has been estimated as 30 per cent, for South Korea and 40 per cent,for North Korea, not all of which is considered necessary to restore. It is contem-plated that only essential restoration will be effected and, after surveys and clearanceprogrammes have been completed, $7 million worth of imported material can beconsumed in reconstruction. During this period, medical supplies and essentialtemporary structures to the value of $11 million will be required to sustain the korean populace.3. Crops and Food. It is estimated that the crops in South Korea have been damaged to the extent of 5 per cent, and 10 per cent, in North Korea. This damagewill be reflected largely in reduced exports of rice rather than in shortages in Korea.However, disruption of transportation, the dislocation of people, and the dis-organisation of Government collection services will make it necessary to arrange to procure some $40 million for South Korea by 31st December, 1950. Some ofthis will not be consumed until 1951, and it is estimated that during 1951 Korea willbecome self-sufficient in food-stuffs. It is, therefore, estimated that only about$2 million worth of food-stuffs will have to be supplied in 1951.4. Other Agriculture. Includes forestry, farm animals, agricultural imple-ments, ox-carts, &amp;c, which estimates indicate sustained 20 per cent, damage inSouth Korea and 10 per cent, in North Korea. The need in this instance requiresan initial capital outlay rather than continuing sustaining imports requirementspending replacements. What are needed primarily are draft animals, simple farmtools and lumber for ox-carts, rather than power machinery.5. Railways. Includes shops,, rolling-stock and terminal facilities indicated to have sustained heavy damages and now operating under makeshift arrangements.All of the damaged installations may not be required to be replaced as a re-routingof right-of-way and the consolidation of repair shops may be determined to be more economical.   Considerable amounts of local labour will be required to be utilised
to place the railroads in readiness for permanent reconstruction and during thereconstruction period. It is essential that the transportation system be established as rapidly as possible, and it is estimated that the equipment and materials to beused will amount to about $40 million.     &apos;. 6. Highways, Bridges, Flood Control and Irrigation. All funds allocatedunder this category would be used for the restoration of installations; no sustainingcosts are involved. During the period under consideration most of the expenditureswould be devoted to highway and bridge repairs.7. Public Utilities. This category covers primarily waterways, communica-tions and electric power. A part of the electric power facilities need not be restoredsince pre-hostilities capacity exceeds foreseeable needs. Restoration of many ofthese facilities, however, is a matter of highest priority.Fairly good surveys of damage to public utilities in South Korea have alreadybeen made; however, little reliable information on damage to North Koreanfacilities is available.. It is to be expected, therefore, that later on the estimateswill need to be revised. The sustaining costs of $5 million represent the costs of operating power barges and the installation of some small generators and other high unit cost equipment to meet temporary needs. Restoration costs amount toabout $20 million.8: Harbours and Docks. Costs of restoration, estimated at $4 million, appearto be low in view of preliminary reports of damage inflicted. A later review of thesituation may, therefore, indicate an increase in the estimate of restoration costs.9. Coastal Shipping arid Fishing. Conservative figures have been used in this category, pending a survey of actual damage and future needs. Damage to north korean vessels was heavy and it may well be that restoration costs have beenunder-estimated.The sustaining costs, totalling $4-5 million, refer to charges for vesselschartered until replacements can be fabricated and to nets and other fishing gear.10. Industrial Facilities. This, the largest of the several categories, includesexpenditures for mines, industrial plant and equipment, warehouses, textiles, fuel,chemicals, and fertiliser and other raw materials. It was recognised that a break-down of this very broad category was necessary and steps have been taken to obtain further details.Sustaining Costs, it will be noted, account for $158 of the estimated total of$179 million. Fertiliser needs alone are expected to amount to $40 to $50 million.Other important raw materials requirements are for cotton, wood products, petro-petroleum  products, bituminous coal, rubber, chemicals, and non-ferrous metals. Theamount of damage done to industries would undoubtedly warrant a much heavieroutlay for restoration of facilities. It is, however, a question whether it would be wise to attempt to commit a larger amount for this purpose in view of, first, thenecessity of drawing up an industrial reconstruction plan; second, the limited man-power, particularly skilled labour, available, and, third, the danger of loosinginflationary pressures. If later surveys indicate the desirability of reducing outlaysfor the reconstruction of other parts of the economy (highways, public utilities,houses, &amp;c.) it may be desirable to increase allocations for industrial rehabilitation.11. Motor Vehicles. Most of the funds allocated in this category would be spent for motor trucks, the destruction of which has been very great. The currentneed for trucking services is acute, owing to the handicaps under which the railway system is labouring and to the loss of draft animals and the current pressingnecessity of collecting and distributing feed and other supplies. On the other hand,the current: trucking needs are abnormal. Taking these factors into account,$10 million for replacements is regarded as a bare minimum requirement.
