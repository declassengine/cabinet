Q 00 oDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS -BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 276 COPY NO,   2217TH NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETFORMOSAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Cabinet decided, at their meeting on 13th November(CM.(50) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 2), that we should consider policy inregard to Formosa in advance of the discussions at Lake Success.2. A brief factual account of the events leading up to the presentposition is attached at Annex A.3. From this account it will be seen that Formosa is due to be dis-cussed both in the Security Council and in the Assembly,    The issue in theSecurity Council is the Chinese complaint against &quot;United States aggression against Formosa&quot;.     The issue in the Assembly is consideration of thegeneral problem of the future of Formosa, for which I have been pressing for some time.     It is intended in this connection to table a Resolution inthe preparation of which the United States and Commonwealth governments have been associated.4. I had hoped that the Assembly Resolution would have been disposedof before discussions began in the Council, but - largely on account of thedelaying tactics of the United States representatives - this has not beenpossible.     We do not yet know when the Assembly Resolution will betabled, but the discussions in the Security Council should begin as soon asthe Chinese delegation arrive.     This is not likely to be earlier than 24thNovember.OBJECTIVES5.   (a)     to avoid involvement in a dispute between the Americans and theChinese;(b) to provide an outlet for the expression of the views of the CentralPeopled Government of China;(c) for these reasons, to set up machinery under United Nationsauspices which will enable the problem to be discussed in a calmeratmosphere, aiming at discussion of possible solutions in a few months&apos;time;(d) meanwhile, to ensure that there is no attempt to settle the Formosanissue by force.     This implies that Formosa shall not itself be attacked, andthat it shall not be used as a base of operations against the Chinese.

0 S6. It is, of course, necessary to bear in mind the Cairo declaration and previous indications of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, suchas statements in the House on the status and future of Formosa.My colleagues will recall that in C.P,(50) 194, dated 3i*tAugust, I said:Il;&quot;There is unfortunately no clear-cut solution of this complexproblem and our endeavour must be to&apos; find a formula which seems likely to command the widest possible measure of support among members of the United Nations, particularly the Asian members. &quot;7. I invite my colleagues to agree -(a) that the United Kingdom representative in the security council should confine himself initially to stating thegeneral desire of His Majestyrs Government to see a peaceful solution of the Formosan problem;(b) that further action should be decided in the light of thecourse taken by the discussions in both the security council and the General Assembly;(c) that the United Kingdom delegate in the General assembly should co-sponsor the proposed Resolution (Annex D),and exercise where possible a moderating influence onthe course of the debate.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.,1,17TH NOVEMBER, 1950.

ANNEX a background TO THE PROBLEMFormosa was Chinese before it was ceded to Japan by theTreaty of Shimonoseki after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95.     the cairo Declaration, reaffirmed at Potsdam, announced that it would be restored to China;   and the island was allowed to pass under Chineseadministration after the Japanese surrender.     The island is stillde jure a part of Japan.2, After the Chinese Nationalists had been expelled from the main-land, they maintained their hold on Formosa.     From the island, theycarried out air raids on the mainland, and instituted a form of blockade by sea.     When hostilities began in Korea, President Truman declared his intention of &quot;neutralising&quot; Formosa, with the object of preventing the spread of hostilities.     By this, he meant that the United States SeventhFleet would ensure that Chinese Communist forces did not try to invadethe island, while pressure would be exerted on the Nationalists to stop theirair raids on the mainland and their maritime blockade.    Apart from anumber of minor incidents over shipping proceeding to China ports, theseaims have so far been achieved.3,     Consideration in the United nations on 24th August, Chou En-lai, Foreign Minister of the central people&apos;s Government, sent to the Secretary-General and the President ofthe Security Council a telegram complaining of &quot;United States aggression against Formosa&quot; (Annex B).    A letter from the United States represen-tative on the Security Council to the Secretary-General of the United Nationsrefuting these charges was circulated to members of the Security Councilon 25th August (Annex C).     On 29th August, the Security Council decided,in spite of the objections raised by the Chinese (Nationalist) representative,to include this complaint in its agenda.     Other more urgent items then onthe agenda (e. g. Korea) were nevertheless to be dealt with first.     TheCouncil also declined to invite representatives from the Central People&apos;sGovernment until the question of Formosa had come up for consideration.The Chinese complaint was eventually considered in the Security Councilon 26th, 28th and 29th September.     By that time, the United States hadalready formally requested that the question of Formosa be included in theGeneral Assembly^ Agenda as an important and urgent item.     The UnitedStates explanatory memorandum on this item contained the following statement:&quot;The United States considers that the General Assemblycould make an important contribution towards carrying out thepurposes and principles of the United Nations in the Pacific areaif it should study the general situation with respect to Formosawith a view to formulating appropriate recommendations.&quot;The point was made during discussion in the Council that it would beinconvenient if the Assembly and the Council were to discuss simultane-ously these parallel questions, perhaps arriving at different conclusions.A resolution was adopted by the Council on 29th September deciding that consideration of the Chinese complaint should be deferred until after 15thNovember, when representatives of thes Central People&apos;s Government

should be invited to state their case.     In thus deferring consideration bythe Council it was clearly contemplated that the Assembly would by this date have reached some conclusion on the general question of the futureof the island.4. &apos; On the wider question before the Assembly of the future of formosa, His Majesty&apos;s Government to*k the initiative two months ago bysuggesting a draft resolution recounting briefly the facts of the situationand proposing the establishment of a United Nations Commission to study the problem and submit a report to the General Assembly.    As a resultof discussions between the United Kingdom delegation, State Departmentrepresentatives and Commonwealth delegations, the broadest measure ofagreement possible under the circumstances has been reached on the formof this Assembly resolution.     The latest text of the resolution is attachedat Annex D, but it is hoped that paragraph 3 may be deleted, or at leastredrafted.     This paragraph, besides being badly worded, might be con-sidered to imply too great a degree of United Nations commitment inFormosa.5. During the discussions, it became clear that the Americans hadmodified their position and were no longer anxious for very early con-sideration by the Assembly.    In spite of the efforts of our Delegation tohave the item taken earlier in the Assembly, discussion of it has been delayed and latest indications are that it will not be taken up until next week at the earliest.6. Meanwhile the Central People&apos;s Government have been taking theline in public utterances that the question of the ultimate fate of Formosais an internal matter, with which the United Nations has no business tointerfere.    Again, when informing the Secretary-General on 4th Novemberof his Governments unwillingness to accept the Security Councils invita-tion to send representatives when the Council considered the special report of the Unified Command on the question of Chinese intervention in korea, Chou En-lai suggested that discussion of the question of &quot;armedintervention in Korea by the United States Government&quot; should be combined with discussion of their complaint regarding &quot;American aggression againstFormosa. .

p 1a i.   . ANNEX BCABLEGRAM DATED 24TH AUGUST, 1950, FROM THE MINISTERFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE CENTRAL PEOPLE&apos;S GOVERN-MENT OF THE PEOPLED REPUBLIC OF CHINA ADDRESSED TOTHE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCILOn 27 June this year, President Truman of the United Statesof America announced the decision of the United States Governmentto prevent with armed forces the liberation of Taiwan by the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Liberation Army.     Meanwhile, the United States&apos;SeventhFleet moved towards the Straits of Taiwan, followed by the arrival in Taiwan of contingents of the United States Air Force, in an openencroachment on the territory of the People&apos;s Republic of China,This action on the part of the United States Government is a directarmed aggression on the territory of China, and a total violation ofthe United Nations Charter,Taiwan is an integral part of China.    This is not only a fact based on history, confirmed by the situation since the surrender of Japan, but it is also stipulated in the Cairo Declaration of 1943 andthe Potsdam communique of 1945 as binding international agreements which the United States Government has pledged itself to respect andobserve.The people of China cannot tolerate this action of armedaggression by the United States Government on the territory of China,and are determined to liberate from the tentacles of the United Statesaggressors Taiwan and all other territories belonging to China.     Onbehalf of the Central People&apos;s Government of the People&apos;s republic of China, I now raise to the United Nations Security Council the accusation and propose that for the maintenance of international peace and security and for the upholding of the dignity of the United nations charter, the United Nations Security Council is obliged by itsinalienable duties to condemn the United States Government for itscriminal act in the armed invasion of the territory of China, and totake immediate measures to bring about the complete withdrawal ofall the United States..armed invading forces from Taiwan and fromother territories belonging to China.

9 RANNEX CLETTER DATED 25TH AUGUST, 1950, FROM THE UNITEDSTATES REPRESENTATIVE ON THE SECURITY COUNCILTO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONSThere has been circulated to members of the Security council a paper which charges the United States with aggression against Formosa.The paper asks the Security Council to consider the question of Formosa.The United States Government does not intend to discuss at this time this paper or the ridiculous falsehoods which it contains.    It doeswish to take this occasion to make a further statement about the Formosanquestion.On June 27 the United States Representative read at the security council the following statement of the President of the United States:&quot;In Korea the Government forces, which were armed to preventborder raids and to preserve internal security, were attacked byinvading forces from North Korea.     The Security Council of theUnited Nations called upon the invading troops to cease hostilitiesand to withdraw to the 3 8th parallel.     This they have not done but,on the contrary, have pressed the attack.     The Security Councilcalled upon all Members of the United Nations to render everyassistance to the United Nations in the execution of this resolution.In these circumstances, I have ordered United States air and sea forces to give the Korean Government troops cover and support.The attack upon Korea makes it plain beyond all doubt thatCommunism has passed beyond the use of subversion to conquerindependent nations, and will now use armed invasion and war.     Ithas defied the orders of the Security Council of the United Nations,issued to preserve international peace and security.     In these cir-cumstances, the occupation of Formosa by communist forces wouldbe a direct threat to the security of the Pacific area and to UnitedStates forces performing their lawful and necessary functions inthat area.Accordingly, I have ordered the Seventh Fleet to prevent anyattack on Formosa.    As a corollary of this action, I am calling uponthe Chinese Government on Formosa to cease all air and sea opera-tions against the mainland.     The Seventh Fleet will see that this is done.     The determination of the future status of Formosa must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations.I have also directed that United States forces in the Philippinesbe strengthened and that military assistance to the PhilippineGovernment be accelerated.I have similarly directed acceleration in the furnishing ofmilitary assistance to the forces of France and the associated states in Indochina and the dispatch of a military mission to provide closeworking relations with those forces.

I know that all Members of the United Nations will consider carefully the consequences of this latest aggression in Korea in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations.    A return to the rule of force in international affairs would have far-reaching effects.The United States will continue to uphold the rule of law.I have instructed Ambassador Austin, as the Representativeof the United States to the Security Council, to report these steps tothe Council. &quot;Since then, the President of the United States on July 19 made the followingdeclaration in a message to the Congress:&quot;In addition to the direct military effort we and other Membersof the United Nations are making in Korea, the outbreak of aggressionthere requires us to consider its implications for peace throughoutthe world.     The attack upon the Republic of Korea makes it plainbeyond all doubt that the international Communist movement isprepared to use armed invasion to conquer independent nations.We must, therefore, recognize the possibility that armedaggression may take place in other areas.In view of this, I have already directed that United States forcesin support of the Philippines be strengthened and that military assistance be speeded up to the Philippine Government and to the associated States of Indochina, and to the forces of France inIndochina.     I have also ordered the United States Seventh Fleet toprevent any attack upon Formosa, and I have requested the ChineseGovernment on Formosa to cease all air and sea operations againstthe mainland.     These steps were at once reported to the united nations Security Council.Our action in regard to Formosa was a matter of elementarysecurity.     The peace and stability of the Pacific area had beenviolently disturbed by the attack on Korea.    Attacks elsewhere inthe Pacific area would have enlarged the Korean crisis, therebyrendering much more difficult the carrying out of our obligations to the United Nations in Korea.In order that there may be no doubt in any quarter about our intentions regarding Formosa, I wish to state that the United states has no territorial ambitions whatever concerning that island, nor dowe seek for ourselves any special position or privilege on Formosa.The present military neutralization of Formosa is without prejudice to political questions affecting that island.     Our desire is that formosa not become embroiled in hostilities disturbing to the peace of the Pacific and that all questions affecting Formosa be settled by peaceful means as envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations.With peace reestablished, even the most complex political questions are susceptible of solution.     In the presence of brutal andunprovoked aggression, however, some of these questions mayhave to be held in abeyance in the interest of the essential securityof all. &quot;

These statements and the facts to which they related makeperfectly clear certain fundamental points which the people of the worldwill have clearly in mind:1.      The United States has not encroached on the territory of China,nor has the United States taken aggressive action against China.2.      The action of the United States in regard to Formosa was taken at a time when that Island was the scene of conflict with the mainland.More serious conflict was threatened by the public declaration of theChinese Communist authorities.     Such conflict would have threatened thesecurity of the United Nations Forces operating in Korea under the mandateof the Security Council to repel the aggression on the Republic of Korea.They threatened to extend the conflict through the Pacific area.3.      The action of the United States was an impartial neutralizingaction addressed both to the forces on Formosa and to those on the main-land.     It was an action designed to keep the peace and was, therefore, infull accord with the spirit of the Charter of the Unied Nations.    as president Truman has solemnly declared, we have no designs on Formosa,and our action was not inspired by any desire to acquire a special position for the United States.4.      The action of the United States was expressly stated to be withoutprejudice to the future political settlement of the status of the Island.The actual status of the Island is that it is territory taken from Japan bythe victory of the Allied Forces in the Pacific.     Like other such terri-tories, its legal status cannot be fixed until there is international action todetermine its future.     The Chinese Government was asked by the Allies totake the surrender of the Japanese forces on the Island.     That is thereason the Chinese are there now.I5.      The United States has a record through history of friendship forthe Chinese people.     We still feel the friendship and know that millions of chinese reciprocate it.     We took the lead with others in the last united nations General Assembly to secure approval of a resolution on the integritylof China.     Only the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics and itssatellites did not approve that resolution.6.      The United States would welcome United Nations consideration ofthe case of Formosa.     We would approve full United Nations investigationhere or on the spot.     We believe that United Nations consideration would contribute to a peaceful, rather than a forcible solution of that problem.7.      We do not believe that the Security Council need be or will be diverted from its consideration of the aggression against the Republic of korea.     There was a breach of the peace in Korea.     The aggressorattacked, has been condemned, and the combined forces of the United Nations jare now in battle to repel the aggrescion.     Formosa is now at peace andwill remain so unless someone resorts to force.     If the Security Councilwishes to study the question of Formosa we shall support and assist thatstudy.     Meanwhile, the President of the Security Council should discharge the duties of his office and get on with the item on the agenda which is the complaint of Aggression upon the Republic of Korea, and, specifically, the recognition of the right of the Korean Ambassador to take his seat and the vote on the United States resolution for the localization of the Koreanconflict.I request that this letter be circulated to members of the security council. 0
