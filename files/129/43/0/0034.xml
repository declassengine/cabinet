(50)284 .21th November, 1950CABINETEGYPT:   defence memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs is due to arrive in London onMonday, 27th November, as leader of the Egyptian Delegation for the sterling balances talks. It is understood that he is also willing to discuss the problemof defence. It is suggested, that our attitude on defence should be based on thefollowing considerations:  .The Attitude of Egypt2. I attach as Annexes A and B the texts of the passage on Anglo-Egyptianrelations from the Speech from the Throne in Cairo on 16th November, and ofmy statement in the House on 20th November.3. Subsequent information from various sources indicates that the egyptian government are nervous of the repercussions to their statement, which was, madefor internal political consumption. It may well be, although it is by no meanspertain, that they have no intention of taking any specific steps in the near futureon the lines indicated in the Speech, and may be willing to discuss matters in adifferent spirit. But even before the Speech, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairoconsidered that the Egyptian Government would never accept a solution ,which did not involve the withdrawal of British forces from Egypt within a fairly short period, e.g., a year. Further, the Egyptian Government have said that they cannot accept the principle of joint defence arrangements in peace-time. By this, however,they may, and probably do, mean the presence of British forces in Egypt in peace-time, and may not necessarily be thinking of other aspects of peace-timeco-operation in defence.4. At the same time, the Egyptian Government, in their conversations with: us, have so far said that they are willing for the base installations arid material^to remain in Egypt in peace-time under Egyptian care, and. that they agree thatwe should re-enter Egypt in war-time.5. So far, therefore, no differences have arisen over co-operation in war-time,but very grave difficulties over co-operation in peace-time.6. King Farouk has told us that he does not wish our forces to leave Egypt.His advice to us is to keep on talking with the Egyptian Government, leaving our forces where they are. He has expressed the view that developments in the inter-nationai situation may affect the position to our advantage.7. Meanwhile, the Egyptian Government have indicated through theEgyptian Ambassador that they have been wondering whether there might bea place for Egypt within an extended Atlantic Pact, or within some similar arrange-ment which would provide a basis other than bilateral for a solution of Anglo-Egyptian difficulties.The Views of the Chiefs of Staff8. The Chiefs of Staff have asked the Joint Planning Staff to prepare, without commitment, a study of possible alternative locations in the Middle East for (a) our striking force;(b) an auxiliary peace-time base to supply this force.39693 &quot; copy No.32
This would be on the assumption that the wartime base in Egypt would be lookedafter by the Egyptians, possSfeiy ^withAsb^Sfitisn: tetetotiiclalis, and that we should re-enter Egypt in time of-war; - Among; locations&apos; being examined are Libya, theGaza Strips Cyprus; Turkey and Greek Islands: It is now understood that this paper is unlikely to he completed befpre the end of December.The Attitude bf the United States    &apos; &quot; - &apos; &apos;       &apos; J9.  The United States Government agree with our assessment of the strategic importance of Egypt.   They have undertaken to give us appropriate diplomatic, support with.the Egyptians; and have in fact let the Egyptians know their views.10. They have recently informed us that they are prepared to associate them-selves with us in making a joint Anglo-American approach to the Egyptian Govern-ment about defence facilities in Egypt, and are waiting for suggestions from us onthe form which this might take.11. The Americans have also told us that they would like to station someAmerican air force personnel in Egypt in peace-time to assist, in maintaining the strategic airfield at Abu Sueir.The Relationship of Turkey and Greece to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.12.   The North Atlantic Treaty Powers have recently invited Turkey and greece to associate themselves with the defence planning of the North atlantic treaty Organisation.   Both Governments have accepted the invitation.The Possibility of Associating Egypt with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, 13. If the Egyptian suggestion for association with the North Atlantic treaty organisation (see paragraph 7 above)were followed up, this might be done in either of two ways:  (a) First, Egypt might actually be admitted to membership of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation. This would present a number of formidable diffi-culties. We know that the United States Government would be extremelyreluctant to enlarge its political commitments in this manner and at this stage, and-aed-feel that additional membership by one Middle East country would result inapplications by others. Other signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty may beexpected to feel the same reluctance. It will be recalled that it was recently decidedthat Turkey and Greece could not at this stage be admitted to membership.(b) An alternative would be for Egypt to be associated with the defence planning of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the same manner as greece and Turkey! This would present fewer difficulties, but even to this step there mightbe reluctance on the part of the United States and other members to be overcome.14. Some thought has also been given to the possibility of turning Abu Sueirinto a N.A.T.O. Airfield. This might conceivably afford a contribution to solving the problem of the joint air defence of Egypt, but would not solve the problem ofland forces.Other Possible Methods of Approach15.   These include (a) Discussions between the United Kingdom, Egypt, Greece and Turkey, andpossibly the United States, independently of the North Atlantic treaty organisation, but in parallel with the planning between Greece, turkey and the North Atlantic Treaty -Organisation;1 . (b) similar discussions, but including some other Commonwealth countries&apos; (e.g., South Africa);(c) the Egyptian Government voted for the Assembly Resolution of 3rdNovember, 1950 (see paragraph 24 below); which recommends, to member States to maintain a contingent of armed forces within their territory ready for service as a United Nations unity. It is perhapsworth considering whether a United Nations unit might be formed and kept in Egypt, containing both an Egyptian and a British contingent,the latter being, in fact, our striking force. There might be a united nations Commander, who should be British, but might perhaps fly a united Nations flag. This suggestion is new, and would require further!    examination. But it is perhaps worth mentioning.
;-u!J16.&apos; ^Ohe of the main advantages of a defence arrangement on a multilateralbasis, whatever its form, would be that it would remove the defence problem ofEgypt from a bilateral basis, which may always be represented as unequal, to a wider basis to which this objection would not apply to the same extent.&apos; 17;^ But;th;e problem of securing Egyptian agreement to the presence of any foreign contingents in peacetime on Egyptian soil would still have to be faced.18.; One Way of meeting this difficulty might be on the lines suggested by the iraqi Prime Minister, namely, that each State taking part would offer the facilities required by us, thus making them equal partners. Whether Greece and Turkey,if they were concerned, would agree to this, would have to be further explored,but the possibility need not be completely ruled out.19. Meanwhile, other Arab Governments are being approached on the linesof the statement contained in Foreign Office telegram No. 703 to Bagdad (Annex C).The Governments of Turkey and Greece have already been approached on some-what similar lines.Recommendations20. In the light of the above and, subject to any developments which may occur meanwhile, I shall concentrate in the negotiations upon seeking first of alla feaffirmatiori-of the willingness Of the Egyptian Government to stand with theWestern world, and in particular His Majesty&apos;s Government in the event of war.The Egyptian Government voted for the General Assembly resolution of3rd November, 1950, which provides for emergency action by &quot;Members of theUnited Nations in the event of a threat to the peace and of the Security Councilbeing unable to agree; and recommends Member States to maintain a contingent of armed forces ready for service as a United Nations unit. It might be useful to record our common attitude in supporting this resolution.21. I shall also seek, if possible, to record agreement on the use by HisMajesty&apos;s Government of the Egyptian base in war-time.22. Having recorded that no differences have arisen between us about our respective obligations as members of the United Nations, and about our co-opera-tion in war-time, I shall propose an examination of the difficulties which still exist between us about defence matters in peace-time, with the object of recording our common desire to overcome them by negotiation and mutual agreement. If agree-ment on a bilateral basis is difficult to achieve, I might suggest the possibility of,looking for a solution on a basis wider than bilateral. I could then, subject to whatthe Egyptian Foreign Minister may have to say, try and find out which, if any, ofthe many alternatives he is willing to discuss.23. If no progress can be made on the lines of the preceding paragraph, I shallaim at recording agreement on the lines of paragraphs 20 and 21, and in reaching agreement that both sides would think the matter over further in the light of thediscussions in London without making any precipitate move.24. Any suggestion of a joint Anglo-American approach to the egyptians would have to be held over until we see how the talks go.25. If any progress is made on any line of approach in which american support or intervention would be helpful, I suggest that we should ask for it. if no progress is made in the negotiations, we should consider asking the americans to join with us in urging the Egyptians to think matters over calmly in the light ofthe London Talks, to take no precipitate action, and to seek fresh means of reconciling differences of view.26. I consider that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs general attitude should be oneof firmness combined with patience. It must again be made clear that we cannotadmit that the Treaty can be modified except by mutual consent, but that we are anxious to reach an agreement which will take due account of the defence needs ofthe Middle East as a whole, which will be on a basis of equality, and which will be fully in accordance with the independence and sovereignty of Egypt. I may indicatethat if such an agreement can be reached, there is no reason why in due course itshould not replace the existing Treaty.39693 &quot; b 2
27. Our first position must however be that; whateyetrplah is- adopted, there ought to be a small striking force in Egypt in peace-time, which would.include aBritish contingent. :-.--;,.&apos;:f himiihd &apos;a mon    73.: r28. As regards arms, policy towards Egypt will have-t6&apos;^B^e^ieW^&apos;m:&apos;iktlight of the talks, and the Egyptian Foreign Minister should be informed. Inthis connection it has been decided that the releasedof;&quot;,the.,. 16 Centuriontanks for Which Egypt has paid to the extent of 80 per cent, shall be suspendeduntil a report can be made to the House on the forthcoming talks with the egyptian foreing Minister, tis$i%im$j. -:-v :&apos;i::;J -j E.

My Government considers that the 1936 Treaty has. ceased to be a ;basis for Anglo-Egyptian relations. It is inevitable that its annulment should be decidedand that new provisions should be arrived at based on other principles which you can approve, namely, total and immediate evacuation and the unity of Egypt andthe Sudan under the Egyptian Crown (applause). My Governmeiiitrproclaims thatit will never depart from those principles and it is profoundly convinced that the recognition of those principles by the British Government would be the surestguarantee for the maintenance of peace and security in the whole Middle East.My Government hopes soon to receive in this connexion proposals for conciliatingthe two points of view satisfying the wishes of the beloved valley.-&apos; ; i;;3. In any Case, my Government continues to work without respite or hesitationfor the realisation of the national objectives. With your support, and thanks dothe vigilance and help of the nation, it will not fail, in order to, attain its ends, to employ every means, notably that of proclaiming the obligation of the. 1936 Treatybecause it is in flagrant contradiction with the United Nations Charter, and becausemoreover the circumstances which had accompanied its conclusion have totallychanged, and this measure would naturally involve the end of the agreements of16th January and 10th July, 1899 [corrupt group], relating to the dual administra-tion of the Sudan. &apos; !?.:?:&apos; ?;k;: -4. My Government hopes that the British Government Will understand whatdemocracy would reap and-what world peace would gain if satisfaction were, givenimmediately to the just claims of the Nile Valley, Egypt and the Sudan, whichin that case could devote itself entirely to its task in building the edifice of civilisa-tion and placing itself on the side of the democracies to serve the cause of peace.ANNEX statement on Anglo-Egyptian Relations made by the Foreign secretary in the House of Commons on 20th November, 1950The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which was approved by the Parliamentsof both countries, contains no provisions for modification or revision except by mutual consent. His Majesty&apos;s Government have, nevertheless, been willing todiscuss the possibility of revision with the Egyptian Government and there, havebeen discussions this summer between His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador.and the egyptian government.
It has always been the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to, settle; outstandingdifferences with Egypt-in the spirit of the long tradition of friendship between thetwo countries, on a basis of equality, and with full respect for the independence andsovereignty of Egypt. &quot; &quot;     * , i ..,!The two Governments have in fact been in contact for many moiiths&quot;oh defence matters, with the object of removing&apos;misunderstandings and &quot;difficulties in the spiritI have stated. In these discussions ho &apos;(Meren^.^h^pf^dpte;&apos;haS&apos;;ariseri::^eDvthe-defence of the Middle East in time of war. Both for this reason and in view of our obligations under the Treaty, His - Majesty V Government hasv accordingly &quot;cohtinuedto give assistance to the Egyptian Government in the training and equipment oftheir forces. The needs, however, of our own forces, those of other Common-wealth countries and of other North Atlantic Treaty Powers with whom we haveworking defence agreements, must and will come first, but for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to deny such assistance to Egypt and to certain other countriesaltogether would be contrary to our Treaty obligations. ,The difficulties which have not yet been resolved do not, as I have said, concernaction in the event of war, but the question of defence measures in time of peace.The Egyptian Government have stated that they wish all British forces to be with-drawn from the Canal Zone in time of peace.The principle of common defence measures in time of peace has been acceptedby all the Western Powers and is fully compatible with national independence andsovereignty.Other countries in the Middle East are co-operating in this way. 1This is not a matter which merely concerns the United Kingdom and Egypt.What is at stake is the safety and independence of other countries also. I can assure them, as I assure the House, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of taking any steps or,agreeing to any measures which leave the middle east defenceless, or would needlessly prejudice the safety of free and friendlycountries in that area and elsewhere.As regards the Sudan, that country has been the scene of great progress in the,political, social and economic field during recent years. It would be tragic if anything were to disturb this. His Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude remains thesame. It is briefly that the Sudanese should in due course freely decide their ownfuture.In spite of the difficulties, I do not despair of being able to reconciledifferences with Egypt on a friendly and just basis which will take account of the factors I have outlined. The Egyptian Foreign Minister will be visiting Londonnext week, and this I understand will give us an opportunity, to talk the matter over further.i   ANNEX C ;; .;Foreign Office Telegram No. 703 of 18th November, 1950, to Bagdad, Jedda,Amman, Beirut and Damascus .You may speak on the following lines:  2. For some time past informal talks have been taking place between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government about defence.3. His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy is that the Arab States should preservetheir independence and should develop a more prosperous and stronger national life in friendship and co-operation with other free countries. If this is to happen peaceful and stable conditions are required throughout the Middle East in time of peace.If an attack were made against Middle East States from outside, the Middle Eastmust be defended.4. No country to-day is strong enough to stand alone against a powerfulenemy. Neither the United Kingdom nor the United States could do so. For thisreason Western countries are joining in making common defence arrangements under the North Atlantic Treaty. !5. If the Middle East is to be defended, the assistance of other free and friendly Powers, and particularly of the United Kingdom, is required. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are prepared to make the major contribution to such defence. their object is to assist Middle East countries to maintain their independence; and riot
to interfere with their independence:; Under the ^Tripartite Statement of May last,they have also, in conjunction with the United States and France, declared their L.intention to assist Middle East countries to maintain their independence against any danger from within the area. :   1 - j6.   Under conditions of modern warfare, as events in Korea have shown, Isuccessful defence cannot be undertaken in war-time without adequate preparationin peace-time.  Otherwise the potential aggressor may gain the initial advantage and overrun the countries concerned.7. A Defence Plan, to have any hope of success, must involve the maintenance in peace-time of a base or bases in which stocks of war material can be assembled,the ground organisation necessary for air operations prepared, and a minimum ofrighting forces held ready for immediate action while reinforcements are coming.8. Egypt alone possesses the ports, communications and industrial and labourresources required for a main base from which defence for other and more exposedcountries can be provided.9. Were Britain no longer to have the use of such a base, it would be impossiblefor her to provide the immediate help necessary in the event of an attack oncountries such as Iraq, Persia and Turkey and their neighbours.10. Under the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment enjoys the facilities necessary in Egypt for this purpose. But this treaty expires in 1956 and successive Egyptian Governments have expressed theview that its terms no longer correspond to the status of Egypt as an independentnation.11. His Majesty&apos;s Government, who themselves gave independence to Egypt,are sympathetic towards her national aspirations. Far from wishing to interfere with her independence, they wish to ensure that it will be preserved. But they cannot I agree with the view expressed by the Egyptian Government that to join in common defence arrangements, in the same manner as the United Kingdom herself, theUnited States and Western European countries are themselves doing, is at allinconsistent with national independence. They have offered to the egyptian government to work out an arrangement which would take the greatest possibleaccount of Egypt&apos;s wishes while at the same time providing for the maintenanceof the minimum facilities necessary for the defence of the Middle East as a whole.They have, for example, offered to transform the British base in Egypt into an anglo-Egyptian base on the principle of complete equality of status, and to arrangefor equal Egyptian participation in the air defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal.They would be prepared to consider common defence arrangements of a widercharacter if this were desired. Hitherto, however, all their approaches have been met by a complete refusal on the part of the Egyptian Government to consider any arrangement which does not provide for the complete and unconditional evacua-tion of British troops from Egypt within a specified period and the egyptian government have completely rejected the principle of joint defence arrangements in peacetime, which has been accepted by all the Atlantic Powers as their only hopeof successful defence against aggression.12. If the Egyptian Government were to maintain their present view, itmight be impossible for the Middle East to be defended at all, and countries nearerthan Egypt to a potential enemy would be left completely exposed. It wouldalso become impossible for Britain to take action under the Tripartite declaration in the event of a threat to Arab countries from within the region..;i 13. His Majesty&apos;s Government are continuing their attempts to reach a satis-factory agreement with the Egyptian Government. In the meantime they hopethat the Government to which you are accredited will appreciate what is involvedin terms of their own safety, and will find it possible, if a: suitable opportunity should arise, to express to the Egyptian Government the view that for a Vacuumto be left in Egypt would expose all Arab countries to agression and that the earlycondition of a satisfactory agreement which would not involve this danger is tothe common interest. -
