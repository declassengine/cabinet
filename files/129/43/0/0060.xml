DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT) fSECRETCP. (50) 31012TH DECEMBER, 1950245copy nok 3 2CABINETEGYPT:   defence memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe Cabinet will remember that when they last considered thisquestion on the 30th November (CM. (50) 79th Conclusions, Minute 4), theyhad before them two memoranda by me - CP. (50) 283 and CP. (50) 284.The Cabinet then agreed that, in my discussions with the Egyptian ForeignMinister, I should take the line indicated in paragraphs 20 to 27 of C. P. (50) 2b4.Briefly, this was to make it clear that, while we could not admit that theTreaty could be modified except by mutual consent, we were anxious to reach agreement which would take account of the defence needs of the Middle East asa whole, but would be fully in accordance with the independence andsovereignty of Egypt.2. I have now had three meetings with the Egyptian Foreign Minister,on the 4th, 7th and 9th of December.   During these meetings he hasreiterated the Egyptian point of view on both the Defence Agreement and theSudan, very much on the lines summarised in the memoranda under reference.He has made it clear that the Egyptian Government would be prepared to agreeto the use by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Egyptian base and to providefull facilities in Egypt for British forces and their allies in war-time, but thatthey cannot accept the presence of British, or any other foreign forces on egyptian territory in peace-time and that they must continue to insist uponthe evacuation of British troops from Egypt within one year.    There are,however, indications that there might be some room for negotiation, at anyrate over the period within which British forces should leave Egypt.   Asregards the Sudan, I shall be submitting a separate report in due course.3. I have recently been considering provisional studies which havebeen made of the difficulties which Egypt could make for us in connection withthe presence of British troops in the Canal Zone, if she wished to do so.Without going into detail, I should like to record my impression that these difficulties might be considerable.   I have also been considering the fact thatthe Egyptians link together the problems of the Sudan and the evacuation of the British forces, and I have come to the conclusion that if the Egyptiansdecided to raise their differences with us once again at the United Nations,they could make out a much more convincing case against us on the latterissue than on the former..  For this reason it.is in our interest that, if thepresent negotiations come to a deadlock, it should be reached rather upon theSudan issue than upon the issue of the presence of British troops in Egypt.Above all, however, I feel it is essential, in the light of the international situation, that we should, if possiole, reach a settlement with the egyptian government on the issue of defence which will contribute to the establishmentof good relations with Egypt.    I do not believe that it would be to our interestto insist upon the retention of British forces in Egypt in direct opposition to

Egyptian wishes, save in the last resort.    I am, however, concerned that the base in the Canal Zone should remain British-owned, but that it should bemaintained by the Egyptians who should give guarantees regarding itscontinued state of efficiency.   Moreover, I have in mind the desirability ofour being in a position to call upon Egyptian man-power, for use in all the numerous ancillary services which would be needed in the event of war.I feel,therefore, that it is of overriding importance that we should try tosecure that the Egyptians give us willingly what we need during the forthcomingcritical period, our most important requirement being an integrated air defence system.4. I have come to the conclusion that, in order to secure this, some concession on our part will be necessary.    i have, therefore, asked theEgyptian Foreign Minister what would be his Governments reaction to apossible suggestion (making it clear that this was a tentative and purelypersonal conception) that a solution to the problem might be found upon thebasis of an orderly transfer to the Egyptian Government of responsibilityfor the maintenance of the base in peace-time, together with the departure ofBritish forces.   Attached as an annex to this memorandum is an outline ofwhat I have in mind.   I have not, however, put this to the Egyptian ForeignMinister in such detail, and in particular I have made no mention of any possible dates for the hand-over, though I have suggested that this might bedone gradually and have made it clear that in my view there could be no possibility of effecting such a hand-over in one year.   I have asked him inreturn for certain assurances, for example, regarding the continued presence in Egypt of a limited number of British technicians, and guarantees regardingthe permanency and security of the base after responsibility for its maintenancehad been transferred to Egypt.   I have also suggested that any such transferof responsibility should be made in accordance with the spirit and terms of the1936 Treaty rather than as a decision to abrogate the Treaty and evacuateEgypt.5. The outline of the plan which I have in mind will require ampli-fication and detailed studies of both the military and political aspects.   Iunderstand that on the military side such a study is already being undertaken by the Chiefs of Staff, and that the results should be available early inJanuary.   The necessary political studies can be initiated at once.Recommendations.     I therefore ask my colleagues:(a) to agree that the necessary studies should be undertaken andthe results made available without delay.(b) to authorise me to inform the Egyptian Foreign Minister that his majesty s Government had considered the method of approach outlinedto him and to inform him that they had given instructions that thenecessary studies should be made in order to see if this method of approach would satisfy the essential defence needs, and that I hoped to be able to discuss it more fully when these studies had beencompleted.    I would not, for the present, go further than this,particularly in view of the danger of a leakage in Egypt   if any: definite proposals were put forward at this stage. - I would, however,urge him to agree that public discussion both in the United Kingdomand in Egypt should be kept to a minimum until the Egyptian Govern-ment had had time to consider our more detailed proposals.E. B,Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,12TH DECEMBER, 1950.

ANNEXOutline of Proposed Settlement1. In view of the present world situation, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not wish to abrogate the 193 6 Treaty.   Nevertheless,His Majesty1 s Government would be ready to accept, if that would facilitate the course of negotiations with Egypt, an agreement in its placewhich would effect the orderly transfer to the Egyptians of their peace-timemilitary commitments and obligations on the Canal.2. This transfer would start taking effect, should the Egyptiansthen express the wish, in 1952 and would be completed by 1956, after which date full responsibility for guarding and maintaining in good order thepresent British base on the Canal would have passed to the egyptian government.3. After 1956, the Egyptian Government would allow periodicinspection of the base by United Kingdom experts.4. In the event of war, the Egyptian Government would provide fullfacilities throughout Egypt for the forces of the United Kingdom and her allies.5. In the interval between now and 1956, His Majesty1 s Governmentwould undertake, in accordance with an agreed programme, to train and equipthe Egyptian armed forces and train the Egyptian technicians who would berequired for looking after the Canal base.6. The United Kingdom and Egypt would conclude an Air defence agreement, the object of which would be to provide an integrated Anglo-Egyptian Air Defence covering at any rate the period up to 1956 and with possible extension thereafter by mutual agreement.
