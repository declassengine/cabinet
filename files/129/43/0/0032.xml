*5    ^ *    ^lku*&quot;[iS DOCUMENT IS THE property OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST YTS GOVERNMENT)S E C c.p..(50) 282 COPY NO. ^229TH NOVEMBER, 1950CABINETARGENTINE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS ANDTHE MEAT ration memorandum by the Minister of FoodMy colleagues have been aware for some time that unlessshipments of meat from South America were resumed by 1st Decembera cut in the meat ration far more drastic than would normally occur atthis time of year would be inevitable in the early months of next year,commencing 1st January.     Without shipments from South Americathere are no prospects of anything better than a lOd ration for the first four months of next year, supplemented for a few months with perhaps2d-worth of canned corned meat, with a possible increase to ls.0dfrom then until home-killed supplies enable it to be increased in thelate summer and autumn.2. Up to quite recently, in order to satisfy United Kingdombargaining requirements, we have refused to negotiate meat prices with Argentina separately from other eJemfettis in the current trade negotiations.     However, in view of Argentina&apos;s continued resistance toour general proposals, the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the President of the Board of Trade and I agreed last week to offer to pay last year&apos;s price of  9&apos;/. 536 per ton provisionally until a settlement could be reached, if necessary leaving the other elementsfor later discussion;   and in the last resort, if this proved to be theonly way of getting the meat moving, to pay  9?. 536 provisionally forthree months, as suggested by the Argentines in a letter sent by SenorHogan to the Foreign Secretary.&apos;    If, however, we cannot secure the resumption of shipments on either of these terms we agreed that,rather than make any further concessions, the ration implications mustbe faced.     Our Ambassador has re-opened negotiations in Buenos Aireson this basis but is not optimistic about securing agreement in time forshipments to be resumed on 1st December.     Uruguay has been offered 97. 536 provisionally, subject to adjustment in line with priceseventually agreed with Argentina, and the prospects of a resumption ofUruguayan shipments within a matter of days are if anything more encouraging.     Our Ambassador in Montevideo has, of course, beenasked to do his utmost to get Uruguayan meat moving.3. It is now virtually impossible for the resumption of shipments from South America to affect our stock significantly at the end ofDecember.     Freight will not be immediately available to lift any large-quantity, but we could pick up a total of perhaps 25,000 tons in linerspace and in such cargo vessels as may be in position, for arrival hereduring January.     From then onwards we ought to be able to lift40/50,000 tons monthly if the meat is available.

4. Unfortunately in the last few days supplies from other sourceshave fallen off seriously and more than is usual even at this season.The loadings from the Southern Dominions of meat which could arrivehere before the end of the year are lower than could reasonably havebeen expected, while home killings are also declining to a greater extent than normal.     The result is that unless we are to finish the year with a stock so low as to make distribution of a reasonable rationimpossible, we must make a cut in meat issues with effect from 9thDecember.     On the present disposition of stocks I should in fact have-wished to make a cut in issues of manufacturing meat a week earlier,but in order to avoid prejudicing the critical negotiations with theArgentine I have, as a temporary expedient, arranged to draw on rationmeat to postpone a cut in the allocation of manufacturing meat for aweek.     This, however, will reduce still further our stocks of rationmeat at the end of the year, and I cannot avoid a cut from 9th Decemberby repeating this temporary arrangement.5. It may be asked whether it would not have been possible toavoid serious cuts at this stage by making easier cuts a little earlier.Naturally, we should have liked to have done that but that course wasruled out for two reasons.     First, as I have said, it was felt that weshould not announce any ration cuts whilst the Argentine negotiationsstood where they did.     Second - and most compelling of all - we couldnot reduce the ration below Is. 6d while the heavy supplies of home-killed meat had to be distributed.     But entries of livestock no longerrequire a ration of Is. 6d to ensure immediate distribution of home-killed meat.6. In the light of all these circumstances we must now take immediate action to conserve our supplies.     Much as I dislikerecommending a reduction in the ration just before Christmas, I nowsee no alternative to a substantial cut in the carcase meat ration and inthe allocation of manufacturing meat from 9th December.     If we do not do this we shall have an unworkable stock with which to start the NewYear, and therefore, for the first time, a possible failure to honour the ration.7. Our stock position is such that I feel we must reduce thecarcase meat ration from Is. bd to Is. 2d a week from 9th December.We are holding a fair stock of canned corned meat (54,000 tons) and Ihave considered to what extent, if any, we could draw on this stock to supplement the reduced carcase meat ration.     This must depend to avery large extent on whether we can reasonably count on an earlyresumption of shipments from South America.     We could safely issue2d-worth a week (2,500 tons) during December, even if a settlement where to be delayed.     If a settlement were reached this week, we couldmanage 4d-worth of canned corned meat a week, thus maintaining thetotal issue at Is. 6d for the rest of the year.8. I had hoped that the reduction might have been less and that we need only have gone down to ls.4d-worth of carcase meat.     But our stocks are so low that to do this would be taking a very grave risk.     Itwould endanger the distribution of the ra.ti.on before the end of the year,particularly if adverse weather conditions or labour troubles were tohold up supplies even for a day or two, and would also seriouslyendanger our supplies in January.9. I should add that in any event, it will be necessary at the sametime to make a cut of about 25% in the allocation of manufacturing meat,stocks of which are also running down.

10. We cannot, however, decide our immediate problem without regard to our supplies in January.     The more we run down our stocks during December, the more hazardous, on any assumption, otir position will be immediately after the turn of the year.    Assuming the changedproposed in paragraph 7 and that shipments from South America areresumed at the beginning of December, we should be able to provide aIs. Od ration of carcase meat throughout January, which we couldsupplement with 4d-worth of canned corned meat.     We might do betterthan this once shipments begin to make themselves felt later in January.But if shipments are not resumed I see no prospect of anything betterthan a lOd ration for the whole of January, with perhaps 2d-worth of canned corned meat.   I must emphasise that these ration levels are dependent on our making the immediate cuts I have indicated above,and on the regular arrival of supplies from overseas and on normalmarketing of home stock.11.To summarise, the courses before us are as follows:(a)To reduce the carcase meat ration from Is. 6d to Is. 2d a week from 9th December, with an addition of 2d-worth of canned corned meat a week if the settlement with Argentina isdelayed;   or 4d-worth of canned corned meat if a settlement where reached this week;   with, in any case, a cut of about 25%in manufacturing meat allocations.     This should enable us to start the New Year with a stock sufficient to distributethroughout January a carcase meat ration of Is. Od supple-mented by 4d-worth of canned corned meat, provided shipments from South America are resumed;   or lOd-worth of carcase meat with 2d-worth of canned corned meat if no settlementhas been reached.(b)     To reduce the carcase meat ration from Is. 6d to ls.4d a week with the addition of 2d-worth of canned corned meat from 9thDecember.    Even if shipments are resumed in December, thiscourse could only be taken with the gravest risk to our end of year stock, with, the very real danger that distribution beforethe end of the year would break down, and with the prospect ofa carcase meat ration lower than Is. Od in January.     If we took this step in the absence of a settlement with the Argentine,not only would we have the danger of a breakdown in distributionbut our stocks would be so low at the end of the year that i could see no prospect of being able to maintain even a 1 Odcarcase meat ration.12. In these circumstances I feel it my duty to recommend that weadopt the course outlined in paragraph 11(a).13. In order that the necessary distribution arrangements may bemade and the trade informed, I shall have to announce our decision bythe latest on Friday, 1st December.     In making this announcement, i suggest we say that the reduction is necessary because of the cessation of shipments from the Argentine since July, but I would not add anycomment which might further strain our relationship with that country.M.W.ministry of Foed, S.W.1,29TH NOVEMBER, 1950.
