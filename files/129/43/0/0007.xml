-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 257 COPY NO._3 24TH NOVEMBER. 1950CABINETWAGES IN THE COAL-MINING industry memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power attach (Annex A) a statement issued by the Coal Board aboutthe agreement which they have just reached with the National Union of mineworkers for the distribution of the increased money given by the twenty-third Award of the National Reference Tribunal (the Twenty-third Porter Award).2. I also attach (Annex B) a memorandum, prepared in theMinistry of Fuel and Power, on the background and content of the twenty-third Porter Award.3. The National Coal Board have not yet been able to let me haveinformation about the effect of the new Agreement on wages in thedifferent coal fields.   Nor have they yet received information about itsreception in the respective coal fields.4. Certain things however are clear:(a) Its reception at the special Delegate Conference held by theNational Union of Mineworkers at York was better than mighthave been expected.    The National Coal Board have heard that the &quot;spirit of the meeting was good&quot;;   and, as the Presshave reported, the adoption of the agreement by theConference was virtually unanimous.(b) The unofficial stoppages organised in Scotland by the communists before the Conference took place are diminishingin number, and will probably cease altogether by Monday(6th November).(c) Under the agreement the increase in earnings to low paid workers in pits where there is organised overtime workingwill be much more than the 5/- increase in the minimum rate.The National Coal Board1 s statement shows (paragraph 8)that the earnings of a surface workman would, under theagreement, become  6.11.3. per week.(d) The total amount of money to be distributed among workersunder the new agreement will be approximately  4 millions( -! million above the Twenty-third Porter Award).    TheNational Coal Board calculate that the number of lower paid workers who will benefit will be approximately 260,000.

(e)   The average increase in earnings per annum for theselower paid workers affected thus will be  14. 10.5. These facts make it plain that the new agreement should beof real benefit to the lower paid workers as a whole.   It may be,however, that in some coal fields the benefit will be&apos;much less thanin others.    In any case, the increases are much below the expectations aroused by the propaganda about the &quot;war addition&quot;,conducted over the last two years by Mr. Arthur Horner, which had led the lower paid workers to expect an increase, not of 5/- but of10/- or 12/- per week.    For this reason it is probable that theagreement, while it will be everywhere honoured by the National Unionof Mineworkers, will probably be a disappointment to the rank and filein some parts of the country.P.

The weekly minimum rates, like the 1947 weekly minimum rates, exclude the shilling per shift paid to the skilled craftsmenand other day wage workers set out in Schedules II and III to theAgreement of 20th April 1944. and usually known as the skilledshilling.    They include the value of allowances in kind as determined in accordance with.the ruling given by the Board of investigation under the Chairmanship of Lord Greene on 3rd July1942.    They include the 1950 flat rate of 2/8 which replaces the waraddition of 2/8 in the case of pieceworkers.    The 2/8 isconsolidated in the shift rate in the case of day wage workers.4. The conditions attaching&apos; to the payment of the weeklyminimum wage contained in Clause 19(3) of the Five-Day WeekAgreement shall continue to apply.Increase in day rates and consolidation of the War Addition of 2/85. The. shift rate at present payable to adult undergrgrounddaywage workmen where it does not include the war addition shall be-1-

The shift rate at present payable to adult surface daywageworkmen where it. does not include the war addition shall beincreased by 2/8 to compensate for the termination of the waraddition under the War Wage Agreement of 20th March 1940 and shallbe further increased by the addition of 6d per shift but not so asto exceed 21/1+ exclusive of the skilled shilling where payable,,7.    ^      The shift rate at present payable to juvenile day wage workersshall be increased by th-3 appropriate amount of the war additionapplicable to each age in accordance with local agreement to oornpen-sate for the termination of the war addition under the War WageAgreement of 20th March I9I4O and shall be further increased by 6dper shift but not so as to exceed the ceilings referred to above in Glauses 5 and 6.Rate for Calculation of Overtime8. The minimum rate payable in respect of weekend work andovertime and to which the appropriate overtime addition is to bemade will be as followsL-(a)    in the case of adult underground workers 20/-&apos;CTo)    in the case of adult surface workers 17/6(c)    in the case of juvenile workers the following rates -Age Underground Surface15 9/1 7/5154 9/7 7/1016 10/- 8/hl6&apos;k 10/6 8/817 11/2 9/217&amp; 11/10 9/718 lk/k 12/-19 15/6 13/-20 16/8 Ik/2ExampleThe effect of this method of ascertaining overtime in thecase of a surface workman is given below:-5 normal shifts at (say) 15/6	 3.	17.	6.Add value of allowances in kind	(say)	2.	-five-Day Week Bonus		15.	6.Make-up to Minimum		10.	&quot;&quot;* *New Minimum	5.	5.	&quot;&quot;* *One overtime shift at 17/6 plus	50%    1	6.	3.		11.	3.Calculation of Make-up in Weeks where a Statutory Holiday Paymentis made9- Where a statutory holiday payment is made in any week, the excess of that payment over the shift minimum shall be excluded whendetermining the amount of the payment by way of make-up to theminimum due in respect of that week.

Consolidation of the War Addition10. The war addition of 2/8 will no longer be payable as aseparate amount.    In the case of adult day wage workers existing day-wage rates will be increased by 2/8 as stated in Clauses 5 and 6 to compensate for the termination of the war addition.    In the case of adult pieceworkers in lieu of the war addition a flat rate of2/8 per shift will continue to be paid and will be known as the 1950flat rate.    In the case of juveniles the appropriate amount of thewar addition will be treated in the same manner as in the case ofadults.Application to Female Workers11. This Agreement will be applied to female workers in the coalmining industry whose wages are regulated in relation to thewages of male workers to whom this Agreement applies and ad just-merits as may be necessary shall be made on the oasis of existinglocal agreements governing the proportionate remuneration applying to female workers.Scope of the Agreement12. This Agreement shall apply to all workers in the coal mining industry to whom the Increase in Wages Agreement of 18th DecemberI9I4.7 applied, except property workers in the Northern Division.Workers employed in coke-oven and by-product works, briquetting works and any workers whose wages and conditions are regulated by theAncil3 rvry Workers Agreement of 5th August I9I+8 whether employed on or ofv colliery premises will be excluded from the scope of thisAgreement.

ANNEX E.   THE TWENTY-THIRD &quot;PORTER&quot; AWABDNote by the Ministry of Fuel and PowerTo understand the Twenty-third Award of the NationalReference Tribunal,  it is necessary to go back to some of theearlier- Awards and Agreements.Previous agreements the Seventh Porter Award&apos; (March, 191+1+)  reaffirmed theprinciple that to reduce weekly minimum wages to shift rates &quot;thefigures must be divided by the number of shifts per week which constitutes for the workman a full working week&quot;.The Five-Day Week Agreement (April, 1947) provided that thenormal working week of underground workers shall be one of fiveconsecutive shifts.    The Agreed Interpretation of this agreement provided,  in Clause 19,  that the full &quot;weekly minimum wage is payable to workers who work the&quot; full qualifying five shifts in aweek.   -But, as to a worker who works less than five shifts in a week,if he qualifies for proportionate bonus, the daily minimum appliedto the shifts he actually works is the weekly minimum divided byfive:    if he fails to  qualify for any bonus the daily minimumapplicable to the shifts he actually works is the weekly minimumdivided by six.The Agreement for Increases in Weekly Minimum and day wage Rates(December, 191+7) provided that the weekly minimum wage for adultworkers should beUnderground                                Surface 5. 15.&apos; -  5.--The Agreement further provided that the shift rate payable toadult day wage workmen should be increased by 2/6 per shift, but not so as to increase any such rate to more than:-Underground Surface19/10 t 18/2 ^j6    exclusive of the skilled shilling and the flat rate war addition of 2/8 a shift.If these flat rate additions are added on, the resultant rates are :Underground Surface23/6 21/10These rates became known as &quot;ceiling rates&quot;.Comments on previous agreements for general purposes, we may take the minimum daily shiftrate to be the weekly minimum divided by six:    i.e.-1-

Underground Surface19/2 - 16/8These minimum rates are inclusive of the skilled shilling and flat rate war addition:    so that it is only if the workers wage is stillbelow the minimum, after having these flat-rate additions credited to him, that his wage is made up to the minimum..The DisputeThe recent dispute turned on who were to be regarded as lower paid workers and what increases,  if any, were to be paid tothem..The miners said that the &quot;ceiling rates&quot; of 194-7 should beraised by 2/- to the following levels:-Underground Surface25/6 23/10and that all workers earning less than these rates should have theirwages increased by 2/- or by such lesser amount as would bring them up to these rates.    They said that the weekly minimum wage should be correspondingly increased,, which would mean an increase of 12/-a week.The National Goal Board,  on the other hand, said thatthe weekly minimum wage should be increased by 5/- to:Underground .  Surface 6--  55-Divided by six,  these give minimum daily shift rates of -Underground Surface20/- 17/6Summary of proposals the categories of workers may be shown in different tiersthus:-Underground only:A_____2-5/6   National Union of Mineworkers proposed new&quot;ceiling&quot;. - -B____23/6    Ceiling rate,  194-7.C_____  ^    20/-   National Coal Board proposed new minimumshift rate.D___   19/2   Minimum shift rate, 1947.Those coming below any of these lines may be regarded as lower paid,workers. The miners   in effect asked that all below line should get an increase.    The National Coal Board said,  in effect,that all below line C should get an increase.    The Miners&apos; proposals would give increases to  some workers who are now earning rates abovethe minimum.    The National Coal Board&apos;s proposals would give increasesonly to  those on or below the minimum and those earning very slighty more than the minimum, but less than 20/- a shift..

OvertimeThe minimum wage applies to the normal working week.    Itdoes not apply to overtime or to Saturday working.    The rates forthis are calculated at l-g- times ordinary shift rates.    These shiftrates may be below the minimum.The miners did not propose any change in this principle,but their proposals involved increases in shift rates below thenew ceilings,  so that there would be corresponding increases inovertime rates.The Board proposed, in,effect,  that the minimum shiftrates should in future apply to overtime and Saturday working,  sothat, where the dayrate was below the minimum, overtime shouldbe calculated at 1-g- times the minimum shift rate.Juvenile sThe weekly minimum wages for juveniles are on a scale workingup to the full adult rates at the age of 21 years (December 19h7Agreement).The miners proposed that there should be appropriate increases in national minimum rates to correspond with the proposed increases in day wage rates.    This, in effect,  implied that  juveniles would,according to the scale,  receive proportionately less than the 12/-increase in the national weekly minimum proposed for adults.The Board proposed that the national weekly minimumbe increased by 5/- and that this 5/- increase should apply to the juvenile minima equally as to the adult minima.The AwardThe Award in effect accepts the National Coal Board&apos;sproposals (which are estimated to cost  2^ millions) as offeringthe basis of a settlement, but wishes to see an arrangement made which will preserve wage differentials to some extent:    it ismade quite clear,  however, that the Tribunal only has in minddifferentials between categories of 6.aywage workers.    Piece workers are not covered by this Award.For this purpose the Tribunal Award is that the total costof the increases to be given to the lower paid workers should amountto  34&apos; millions.    The extra  1-i millions over and above the cost of   ,the National Coal Board&apos;s proposals is to be applied to thepreserving of differentials.Two tasks were given to the Joint National Negotiating Com-mittee of the industry -(i)    the consolidation of the 2/8 flat rate war additioninto existing wage rates:(ii)    the forming of a scheme for the distribution of the 3-^ millions awarded by the Tribunal.A clear&apos;lead was given by the Tribunal that the applicationof this sum should  include an increase in the minimum wage;    and thatthe scheme should include an increase in the day wage rates below acertain ceiling.-3-
