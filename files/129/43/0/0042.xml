THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.    November 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.3 2CP. (50) 29230th November, 1950CABINETWAGES POLICY: SYSTEMS IN OPERATION IN CERTAINFOREIGN countries memorandum by Minister of Labour and National service the Cabinet at its meeting on 3rd July (CM. (50) 41st Conclusions) invited me to submit a summary of available information regarding the system in operation in certain foreign countries by which some measure of central control was estab-lished over the fixing of wage levels.2. Much information was already available from reports by the LabourAttaches in the countries concerned. I have since obtained a great deal of addi-tional information both from the Labour Attaches and through the kindness of organisations in those countries and by personal visits by my officers. By this lattermeans, information of the highest value has been obtained from Holland and denmark. I had intended to visit Holland and the Scandinavian countries myself,but, owing to industrial conditions in this country at the time, the arrangementsfor my visit had to be first postponed and then cancelled. I have, however, hadthe advantage of reading books on the subject sent to me from overseas.3. Summaries of the systems operating in Australia, New Zealand, Holland,Norway, Sweden and Denmark are given in the Appendix.Settlement of Wages in Certain Foreign and Commonwealth Countries.4. In setting out in the Appendix the salient features of each system, I have endeavoured to explain exactly how each system works and what have been theresults as compared with our system measured in terms of wages, or earningswhere information on wages is not available, related to the cost of living and the record of industrial relations. The principal points which emerge are stated in thefollowing paragraphs.5. All the foreign and Commonwealth systems described in the Appendixpossess greater centralised control of wages than is the case in this country, althoughthe degree and type of control vary. In the Scandinavian Countries the control is exercised by the central organisations of employers and trade unions. Thus, in denmark, where agreements have to last for two years, if the individual organisa-tions cannot reach agreement within a specified time the negotiations are taken over by the central organisations and in default of agreement by them an awardmay be made by the State Conciliator. In Norway the central organisation oftrade unions exercises strong control over the action of the individual unions;individual employers may not negotiate direct with the unions, and groups ofemployers only with the consent of the central organisation. A Wages Board, which includes a majority of Government representatives, arbitrates on claims which havenot received the consent of the central organisations of employers and trade unions.In Sweden, where also all agreements are made for two years expiring at about thesame date, the central organisation of trade unions has to be kept in close touchwith negotiations which it reserves the right to take over, while on the employers&apos;side all agreements require the approval of the central organisation.6.   The system in the Netherlands differs from that in the scandinavian countries.   Here wages (including time rates, piece rates and bonus rates) are39716 B
completely controlled by the State through a statutory body called the College ofState Arbitrators. To this body all wages agreements have to be submitted forapproval and employers are required by law to pay neither more nor less than the approved rates.7. In Australia and New Zealand the position is again different from thosedescribed above. The main feature of the systems of those countries is thatstatutory Arbitration Courts fix minimum basic wages for all, or practically all,workers. The fixing of rates in excess of the minimum is, in theory, left to jointnegotiations, but in practice it seems that arbitral awards enter substantially into the determination of such rates also.8. The foregoing mentions only the central features of the various systems.They all include other provisions, which are described in the appendices, of whichI need only mention here those relating to strikes and lockouts. In all thesecountries certain restrictions are placed on the right to strike or to impose a lockout,and, in some&apos; of them, strikes and lockouts are not permitted in connection withdisputes relating to the interpretation of agreements. In some countries(e.g., Denmark) stringent penalties are imposed.9. An examination of the results of these different systems, which have developed from and been dictated by the historical and economic circumstances ofeach country, does riot suggest that they possess outstanding advantages over ourown. Central regulation of wages has almost inevitably led to general increases in wages being made covering the whole field of industry. Thus, in Holland, therehave been three general increases, including two of .5 per cent, each in 1950; thelatest rise attempted to restrict the full amount of the increase to the lowest-paidgroups, but, under pressure of public opinion, the restrictions have now been abandoned. In Australia the basic minimum for males has recently been increasedby 20s. per week; in Denmark there has been a general increase in wages every two years in addition to changes iri accordance with the cost of living. Despite theexistence,in some of the countries in question of rigid price controls and of dividendcontrols, as well as heavy subsidisation of necessities, on the whole wages seem tohave risen in these countries higher in relation to prices than in Great Britain. Thearrangement under which all agreements expire at approximately the same time,while giving a certain measure of stability during the currency of the agreements,also holds the danger of general trouble throughout industry at the same time, and certainly leads to the building up of claims in all industries and a state ofconsiderable tension. Control of wages has necessitated Other controls aridsanctions with consequent lack of flexibility; and in Holland the rigid control exercised there seems to have been accompanied by two disturbing features, namely,a black market in wages and a low level of productivity. Finally, whatever other advantages may be claimed for the central control of wages, it does not necessarilylead to freedom from industrial unrest.The British System10. In order to facilitate our consideration of these matters I have thought itbest to describe the industrial systems obtaining in other countries as factually aspossible and to refrain from critical comments at this stage. For purposes ofcomparing foreign systems with our own I am circulating a separate paperdescribing the system of industrial relations through which our wage levels are determined,in this country, and showing the practical working of this system inthe post-war period. I am also venturing to make suggestions which I hope willbe thought to be of a constructive and practical nature.11. T propose that the information contained in this memorandum should be circulated to my National Joint Advisory Council, and their views should be soughtas to whether any of the features Of the foreign systems, could with advantage be incorporated in our system.        .&apos;   &apos; G.

appendix a. Wages Policy in HollandGeneral Description of system. Since 1945, when the German occupation of Holland came to an end, wages have been controlled by the State, mainly through a College of State Arbitrators,whose functions include the important responsibility of approving wage agreementsbefore they may be implemented. This College is appointed by the Minister of social Affairs, who also nominates one of the eight members as chairman: members are persons of &quot; experience and merit&quot; who are independent of industrial asso-ciations. The decree which set up the Board in 1945 provided that in exercising its powers the Board should comply with the general directions of the Minister of social Affairs. In addition to broad general directives given by the Government,the State Arbitrators were obliged to seek the advice of employers&apos; and workers&apos;organisations through a joint body known, as the Foundation of Labour. the foundation of Labour, which was set up on a voluntary basis in May 1945, consists of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers (excluding represen-tatives of Communist trade unions). It has since been given formal recognition bythe Government under a Royal Decree of October 1945.2. Recent legislation has set up a Social Economic Council representing theGovernment and employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations. The Council has replacedthe Foundation of Labour in the function of advising the College of StateArbitrators and has taken over staff from the Foundation.3. The present system of wage control derives from the economic controls ofwartime and the extremely dangerous economic situation of the country at the liberation, when strict Government control was generally recognised as an essentialsafeguard against inflation. In 1945 the necessary minimum wage for a man withwife and two children was worked out. With this as a basis, differential rates were set up giving advantages of 10 per cent, and 20 per cent, over the basic unskilledwage level to semi-skilled and skilled workers respectively. The rates appropriate to these three levels varied according to district. For this purpose the country wasclassified in five types of district, ranging from rural communities to large cities,according to level of rents, transport costs, and other local factors affecting thecost of living.4. This framework of rates, which was intended broadly to secure the same level of remuneration for the same skill in different industries, including agriculture,provided a standard against which the rates payable in the various industries were settled sometimes by negotiation, subject to approval by members of the college of Arbitrators, sometimes by direct determination by the members of the College.In either case, the College acts only after consultation with the Social economic council (formerly with the Foundation of Labour). The rates approved ordetermined by the College of Arbitrators are legally binding, and employers arerequired to pay neither more nor less. Some latitude for the payment of wagesabove the standard rates is given by the College of Arbitrators in the form of permission to pay a specified percentage of workers at higher rates to allow for recognition of special merit, skill or long service, &amp;c.5. The original framework of wages, as established in 1945, has been foundto be too rigid, and in recent years the College of Arbitrators have been encouraging the use of scientific job evaluation, by raising the highest rates to more than 20&quot;percent, above the unskilled rates and allowing a greater variety of rates within the extended range in firms where scientific job evaluation is adopted. Piece rates and output bonuses are also encouraged, subject usually to average piece/rate earningsnot exceeding 25 per cent, above the appropriate time rates, j:..6. The enforcement of wage decisions by the College of Arbitrators is carriedout by an inspectorate under the direction of the Director General of Labour.7. In order to maintain the purchasing power of wages, a system of subsidies on essential foodstuffs was introduced, and a Wages and Prices Commission set up.Increases in world prices and the gradual withdrawal of price controls (in pursuanceof Western European economic integration policy) have forced up the cost of living,and increases of wage levels had to be approved at the end of 1948, in January 195039716 B 2
and in September 1950. The most recent increase in Holland was subject to a cashmaximum which excluded workers in the higher wage groups from the full effectof the increase, but under pressure from the Unions the Government has now liftedthe limitation, and all salaries and wages are now eligible to receive the full fiveper cent, increase with effect from the original date. The Government has also madea five per cent, increase in Poor Law payments, Widows and Children&apos;s allowances and other social security payments. Although the Government was unable toincrease its subsidy payments and was reluctant to re-introduce those price controls which had been abandoned, a warning was given in September 1950, that excessiveprice increases would be closely examined, and that where necessary measures of price control would be closely re-applied. While the price control was still active,requests to raise the ceiling on output bonuses in consequence of increased productivity led sometimes instead to lower prices being imposed by the price control authorities.8. One of the main objectives of Dutch wage policy has been to maintainthe family income and the full amount of the general wage increases has been limited to male and female workers of 23 years of age and over and married menand breadwinners under 23 years of age. Government interest in family income is also shown by the inclusion in the recent official wage increase statement of anundertaking that &quot; urgent consideration is being given to the question of increases in family allowances and social security benefits, &amp;c.&quot;Legislative Basis of such a System9. The setting up of a system in this country on similar lines to the Dutcharrangements would require extensive new legislation. The various United Kingdomlaws covering payment of minimum wages cover only a limited number ofindustries and although range could be extended under the WaSes Council Acts1945 and 1948, this machinery would not be well adapted to the needs of a nationalwage structure. New legislation would, therefore, be needed to cover the followingpoints:-(a) The setting up of a tripartite body representing workers, employers, and government-nominated independent members which would lay downminimum wages based on subsistence levels for a representative familygroup. Provision would have to be made for the Government to give general directives to this Wages Board.(b) Legislation would also be needed to require wages negotiating bodies tosubmit industrial agreements to the Wages Board for approval beforeimplementation. Agreements in individual industries Would be mainly concerned with grading of workers within the prescribed national wagestructure and the Board&apos;s approval would be, in effect, concerned mainly with the fixing of rates above the basic minima and other problems arising out of industrial and craft wage relativities. The Board wouldalso have to prescribe maximum limits for piece work and bonus\ payments.(c) Powers would have to be taken for the enforcement of payment of neithermore nor less than the appropriate wage rates in all employments.Conclusions10.   Main Features of System(a) Complete control of wages which are determined or approved by the college of Arbitrators, which is a body of Government-appointed/arbitrators.  Employers are required by law to pay neither more norless than the approved rates.(b) The rates fixed are enforced by wages inspectorate and employers are prose-cuted for non-compliance.(c) The general basis of the wage scheme is that there are three broad levels ofwages, one for unskilled workers, one for semi-skilled workers, and one for skilled workers. The rates vary in different districts according tothe cost of living in the area, but all are within this framework. Theobject is to secure as far as possible that for any given level of skillapproximately the same rate of wage&apos;1 is paid in any industry, includingagriculture. The level of the unskilled labourer^ wages is supposed to be sufficient to meet the need of a worker with a wife and twodependent children.
(d) Piece rates and bonus rates are also subject to approval by the College ofArbitrators, and the College fixes in the case of each factory a percentagefigure above the time rates for the various jobs. The average earnings and piece rates must not exceed the time rates by more than the per-centage fixed by the College of Arbitrators.(e) Job evaluation, largely done by private firms of consultants, is encouraged,and where it is put in operation, a greater range of rates within a factoryis permitted than in the normal scheme.(/) Until recently, the College of Arbitrators has been advised in its decisions by the Foundation of Labour, which was a joint body representingemployers and workers. This function has now been taken over by anew Social and Economic Council which contains also representativesof the Government.(g) The system has the support of the employers&apos; confederations (General,Christian and Catholic), and of the three corresponding trade unionfederations, but not of the Communist trade unions.11.   Working of the System(a) As a matter of administration the control of wages appears to be effectivelyadministered. There is admittedly a certain amount of payment of&quot; grey &quot; or &quot; black &quot; wages, particularly in the building industries, but,on the whole, the prescribed wage rates are effectively enforced.(b) When the present scheme was set up in 1945, it involved bringing up thelevel of remuneration in the lower-paid industries such as agriculturequite extensively. Since then, however, there has been little or novariation in the level of remuneration between one industry and another,and, in theory, the system makes no provision for variation of thatcharacter; the object is to remunerate equal skill equally everywhere.Variation of wage rates, therefore, cannot be used as a means of attract-ing labour to undermanned industries.(c) It follows from this that any wage movements which are permitted otherthan changes calculated to introduce more refinement in the recogni-tion of degrees of skill in a particular industry or factory must be of ageneral character affecting all industry. There have in fact been threegeneral increases in the wage level since 1945, including two increases of 5 per cent each in 1950. Increases oh this scale at one time musttend to have an inflationary effect, and all the more since control of&quot;prices and cost of living in Holland has tended to diminish through the pursuit of the policy of greater freedom of European trade.(d) The rigid wage system, including the control of earnings by piece rates and payment by results systems, seems to tend to have a depressing effecton productivity. Although productivity per head has increased sub-stantially since 1945, it is still only 91 per cent, of the pre-war figure.(e) The trade unions belonging to the three non-Communist federations are becoming so closely associated with the administration of this system ofGovernment-imposed wages that it is hard to see how they can retainmuch of a hold over their members.(/) During the period between 1947 and 1950 the general level of men&apos;s wages in industrial and agricultural employments in Holland has risen by 14 percent. The general level of earnings has also risen bv 14 per cent, whilethe cost-of-living index has gone up by 18-5 per cent.(g) The loss of time through stoppages of work due to industrial disputes isabout on the same level, allowing for differences in population, as inGreat Britain. For every 1,000 Dutch industrial workers 361 days were lost in industrial stoppages in the four years 1946-49.B. Wages Policy in DenmarkGeneral Description of SystemThere is no direct Government control of wage levels in Denmark, but the lawspassed in 1899 regulating certain aspects of industrial relations provide a framework within which a national wage policy can operate. The 1899 law, (in addition torequiring that strike or lock-out action can only be decided on in a constitutional
manner and must not take place until after prior notice) laid down a procedure for wage negotiations representing employers and workers. In consequence, thefederation ;of employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations have made rules for the negotiation of wage agreements which cannot be disregarded by their constituents.The most important of these rules are that wage agreements should be current fora two-year period and should terminate on a common date, that they should besubject to a definite time-table for completion of negotiations, and that, if agreement is not reached between the unions and employers&apos; associations concerned, negotia-tions are to be taken over by the two central federations. Another generalagreement of great importance provides for the variation of wages according toa common scale at six-monthly intervals, according to changes in the cost-of-living index.2. Under Danish law, strikes and lock-outs are not permitted on questions concerning the interpretation of agreements; these must be referred for compulsory arbitration. Strikes and lock-outs are legally permissible in connection with the negotiation or renewal of agreements, but only after intervention by State Concilia-tion Officers. The latter may make proposals which have to be put to secret ballotby the two sides; if the ballot is unfavourable, a strike or lock-out is legallypermitted. Penalties for striking illegally are stringent. If the illegal strike affectsonly a part of the industry, the trade unions can Call upon the workers in the restof the industry to break the strike; if the illegal strike covers the whole industry,the trade unions can call a sympathetic strike in another industry to break thestrike. Illegal strikers are fined a definite sum for each day they are on strike; theyare enforced by deduction from wages after return to work, or, alternatively, bydistraint on the men&apos;s effects.3. The concentration of so much authority in wage negotiations in the handsof the employers&apos; and workers&apos; federations has not, it appears, given rise to difficultyin the post-war period until very recently. This is probably due to the automaticnature of wage movements under the cost of living sliding scale arrangements.Moreover, the fact that wage agreements must remain current for two yearsreduces the risk that a successful wage claim will start m motion a wages cyclewith a momentum which may increase as one industry outbids others in the amountof its wage increases.:....... 4.   The working of the arrangements in Denmark in the early months of thisyear gave rise to criticism when wage increases were claimed under about 2,000agreements which were all due to expire on 1st March. Agreement was not reached in the preliminary negotiations between unions&apos; and employers&apos; associations, nor atthe second stage when the two federations considered the claims. Ultimately, anomnibus award covering all the agreements in question was made by the StateConciliation Officer, giving wage increases and other concessions, but only to theextent of the claims made in the individual trade negotiations. Some employers&apos;groups felt that independent negotiation would have produced more equitableresults, whilst trade unions who had been moderate in their claims have had to face criticism from their members.5. It is not clear at the present time whether criticisms of the experience ofthis year are likely to lead to any modification of Danish methods of wagenegotiation. . .Legislative Basis of such a System6. The underlying principle of Danish Industrial relations legislation seemsto have been that legal sanction has been conferred on joint procedures agreed between the two central organisations of employers and workers.7. Under Danish law a permanent Court of Arbitration has been set up and voluntary procedures for wage negotiation have been given legal authority. Thelaw also empowers State Conciliation Officers to intervene in trade disputes and does not forbid strikes or lock-outs unless they concern the interpretation of indus-trial agreements.8. The adoption of such a system in this country would entail new legislation to replace the Conciliation Act, 1896, the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, and theConditions of Employment and National Arbitration Orders.
conclusions .   Main Features of System &apos;(a) Legislation prescribes certain procedures to be operated in industrial nego-tiations, and confers certain authority on the two central organisations of employers&apos; associations and trade unions.(b) Under the rules made by these organisations, Wage agreements are madefor two years at a time and end on a common date. A time-table is fixed for the negotiation of new agreements at the end of the two-year period, and, if agreement has not been reached by a certain time, the.negotiations are taken over by the central associations of employersand trade unions.(c) Under another agreement made between the two federations, wages arevaried at six-monthly intervals in accordance with changes in the cost-of-living index. &apos;(d) Strikes and lock-outs are not permitted in connection with questions con-.cerning the interpretation of existing agreements; on such questions,arbitration is compulsory.(e) Strikes and lock-outs may be resorted to in connection with the negotiation of new or revised agreements, but the question must be referred for,decision to secret ballot, and strikes and lock-outs are only permittedafter the State arbitrator has made an offer to settle the question.Working of the System(1) Wages are liable to an automatic variation at intervals of six monthsaccording to cost-of-living movements;(2) Excessive claims for wages increases are put forward in all industries every two years;(3) A general increase in wages is given every two years;(4) Owing to the termination of all agreements on the same date, there is aserious risk of a general stoppage of work every two years;(5) While peace in industry is more or less guaranteed for two years aftereach settlement, the termination of all agreements on the same dateleads to the building up of claims every two years and a state ofconsiderable tension; ,    .       ;(6) As all the claims for all the industries are grouped together, the smallerindustries and smaller unions are ignored. The State Conciliatoryproposal has to be voted on by all the unions and the Conciliator there-fore necessarily tends to make a proposal which is likely to be accept-able to two or three of the largest unions (the General Workers&apos; Unionhas 40 per cent, of the votes of all the unions).(7) No &quot;data are published regarding movements of Danish rates of wages, butofficial figures are available showing average earnings of adults in a wide range of employments, excluding agriculture. Average earnings in Denmark (which relate to a normal working week excluding over-time) have increased by 15 per cent, between 1947 and 1949, comparedwith a rise in the cost-of-living index of 8 per cent.(8) The arrangements for preventing illegal strikes and lock-outs have been fairly effective in recent years, but the main reason for this is the great power which the central organisations on both sides have over individualorganisations. Nevertheless, for every 1,000 Danish industrial ^workers,1,587 working days were lost through trade disputes in the four years1946-49. This is more than three times as high as the comparable ratefor workers in Great Britain.C. Wages Policy in NorwayGeneral Description of the system. The traditional system for major industrial negotiations in Norway hasbeen based upon agreements between the Federation of Trade Unitins and theEmployers&apos; Association. Owing to the nature of the early development of tradeunions in Norway, the Federation offered valuable; guidance to its constituentsand achieved an authority which time has not diminished as the individual unions have attained full strength; and it is customary, though not compulsory, for unions to seek advice from the Federation on all matters of major importance.  Before
a union enters on a dispute with employers which is likely to involve more thanone union, the prior approval of the Secretariat of the Federation is required, andthe Federation may take over the conduct of the dispute. The Employers&apos; Associa-tion represents the principal industrial groupings, although some independentassociations exist, e.g., in forestry, paper-making and coastal shipping. The dis-decipline of the Employers&apos; Association is even tighter than that of the Federationof Trade Unions. Individual employers may not negotiate direct with unions,and the national groups within the Association may do so only with the permission of the Central Executive of the Association.2. As a means of facing the anticipated difficulties at the end of the war, ajoint agreement was reached to set up a Wages Board with wider powers. TheWages Board, which has since been given legal authority, represents employersand workers with State representatives in a controlling position; the Board maymake binding decisions regarding wages and working conditions if settlement between parties cannot otherwise be reached.3. In 1949, however, there was a partial return to free negotiation whencompulsory arbitration by the Wages Board was limited to claims for changes in wage agreements and working conditions not approved by the Federation of TradeUnions or the principal employers&apos; associations.4. The linking of wage levels and cost of living was, until 1949, an integralfeature of the Norwegian wage system, but the sliding scale principle did not exclude changes in the basic rates or industrial wage relativities, and the tendency in recent years has been to improve the relative wage position of workers in thelower paid industries, such as textiles, paper-making and canning. A successfulsystem of price control has, however, kept the cost of living remarkably stable, andalthough in May 1949 it was 58 per cent, over 1938 levels, the increase in theprevious four years had been less than 3 per cent. Average earnings over thewhole range of Norwegian industry have increased by 90 per cent, between 1938and 1949.5. A policy of agreed restraint in wages has been accepted by the industrial organisations since 1946, and wage increases have, in the main, been limited tothe poorly paid industries. Subsidy reductions and the consequent price increases in 1950, however, have made cost-of-living increases almost inevitable, and, if asubstantial rise should occur, consultation has been promised between theGovernment and industrial representatives to consider whether to increase wagesor social benefits such as family allowances.6. In addition to control over movements of wages and prices, regulationshave been made in respect of distributed profits. Dividends may not- be paid ata rate exceeding 5 per cent, per annum except by permision of the price control authorities.Legislative Basis of such a System7. Industrial legislation in Norway has set up Labour Courts which can givebinding decisions on the interpretation of industrial agreements. Strikes on questions of interpretation are not permitted; all industrial disputes are compulsorilyreferred to a State Mediator, but strikes are legally permissible if his interventionhas failed. The adoption of legislation to bring about a similar system in thiscountry would necessitate new enactments in place of the existing provisions inthe Conciliation Act, Industrial Courts Act, and the Conditions of Employment and national Arbitration Orders.conclusions.  Main Features of the System(a) Strong central control by the federation of trade unions and even strongercontrol by the central employers&apos; association. Individual employersmay not negotiate with trade unions, and groups of employers only withthe permission of the central federation.(b) As a permanent measure, strikes and lock-outs on questions on the inter-interpretations of agreements are forbidden. They are permitted in connectionwith other questions, but only after a State arbitrator has made aproposal to secure an agreement.
(c) After the war a Wages Board was set up, containing representatives ofemployers and workers and a controlling majority of government representatives, with power to give binding decisions on wages questionsunless agreement has already been reached by other means.(d) Since 1949, the authority of the Wages Board has been slightly reduced,and compulsory arbitration by the Wages Board is now confined onlyto claims which have not been approved by the Federation of tradeunions or by the central employers&apos; association.(e) Price control has been detailed, stringent and very effective.(f) Wage rates have until recently been tied to the cost-of-living index and,owing to the stability of the latter movement of wages, has been slight.(g) Since the war there has been in existence a control of dividends, whichare limited to 5 per cent.Working of the System9, While the institution of the Wages Board has given the Government or at least its nominees-the last word in wage settlement since the war, in practicemuch of the determination has continued to be done by collective bargaining.Through their central control, the federation of trade unions and the centralemployers&apos; association have used their influence towards raising the level of wages in the lower-paid industries and wages in agriculture and forestry have been raisedtowards the level of industry generally. The success of the federation of tradeunions in securing general restraint in wage claims by the unions has been largely due to the stringent price control.Official information is not available regarding wage movements in Norway,although figures are published periodically relating to average earnings. Thesefigures show that men&apos;s average hourly earnings in industrial employment (excludingagriculture and transport) increased by 13 per cent, between 1947 and 1950. Thecost of living increased during this period by 3 per cent.In the four years 1946-49, industrial disputes led to stoppages amounting toabout 492 days for each 1,000 wage earners. This figure is more than 20 per cent,higher than the comparable level for Great Britain for the same period.D. Wages Policy in Sweden1. Government regulation of Industrial Relations in Sweden is limited to theprovision of conciliation machinery and of machinery for compulsory arbitration indisputes arising from the interpretation of collective agreements. The law obligesemployers&apos; associations and trade unions to enter into negotiation if asked to doso by the other party, and obliges State mediators to attempt mediation if thereis a break-down. There is no legislation limiting the free negotiation of wages bymeans of collective bargaining, and strikes and lock-outs may be declared inconnection with a wage dispute.2. Nevertheless, a voluntary agreement made in 1938 between the mainemployers&apos; federation and the two major federations of trade unions, which all employers and workers&apos; organisations have ratified, regulates a large field ofindustrial relations, including a uniform system of negotiations. Althoughindividual trade unions conduct their own wage negotiations, the central federationare kept informed and have authority to co-ordinate negotiations if more than oneunion is affected. The employers&apos; federation exercises greater control over itsconstituents and new wage agreements may not be made without its approval.Both federations undertake to try to prevent their affiliated organisations fromresorting to strikes and lock-outs.3. The authority exercised by the central bodies in matters of wage negotia-tion, coupled with the general practice that wage agreements are normally validfor 12 months, and expire at about the same time, tended to keep wage movementsreasonably steady during the immediate post-war years. The system of cost-of-living wage variations which had operated during the war was dropped by mostindustries in May 1947, in favour of a consolidated increase, but price increases later in the year and in 1948 made it clear that widespread wage claims were likely tobe presented. .      .39716
4. In response to Government appeals, cost-of-living sliding-scale agreements which had remained in operation in the Civil Service and municipal employments(and under which increases were due in October 1948) were suspended, and anagreement was made for a complete stop on wage increases in all employments,which came into force on 1st January, 1949, and has been continued through 1950.Workers&apos; representatives have, however, stipulated that wage increases must be claimed if the cost-of-living index should rise to 169. The cost of living has remained reasonably steady aided by tigher price control and the limitation of dividends, but the present tendency is for prices to rise and it seems probable thatthe existing measures of wages restraint will be modified before 1952.Legislative Basis of such a System5. Industrial legislation in Sweden has endeavoured to impose the minimum of interference. If it were desired to imitate the Swedish system in this country,some amendment of the Conciliation Act, 1896, the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, andthe Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Orders would be needed.New provision would have to be made in our laws, requiring industrial parties tonegotiate with each other and making more positive provision for conciliation action by Government officers.conclusion. Main Features of the System(a) The law requires the employers&apos; association and the trade unions tonegotiate with the other side on request.(b) The law prohibits strikes and lock-outs in connection with the interpretation of agreements, and provides for compulsory arbitration in such questions. They are permitted on other issues but there is provision for compulsory-state mediation first.(c) An agreement between the central employers&apos; federation and the two mainfederations of trade unions provides for a uniform system of wagenegotiation. The central federation of trade unions is kept informed by unions about negotiations, and has the right to take over negotiationsif more than one union is concerned. On the employers&apos; side, the disci-pline is even more strict, and employers are not allowed to make wageagreements without the. approval of the central association. both employers and trade unions have agreed that they will try to preventstrikes and lock-outs,(d) Under the agreed system of negotiation agreements are made for two years at a time, the great majority ending at 31st December.Working of the System7. While the legal controls on industrial negotiation in Sweden are not very extensive, a policy of strict wage control has been followed in the post-war periodwith the voluntary co-operation of industry. The willing co-operation of industrial interests with the Swedish Governments policy appears to be based upon theintimate link between the trade unions and the Government.8. Since the beginning of 1949, there has been agreement for a completestandstill on wages, including even the foregoing of wage increases due under cost-of-living agreements. This policy is now being abandoned in view of increases inthe cost of living and it is generally recognised that the new series of wage agreements to be negotiated for operation from the beginning of 1951 will have to allow wages to rise. It is understood that various expedients to evade the wage standstill have come into fairly common use and that unions are now claiming that the new ratesmust be raised to the level of rates actually being paid and that the increase mustcover the rise in the cost of living which is expected to occur.9. The Swedish Government does not publish details of wage movements.There has been a steady upward movement of earnings and in May this year average earnings of men and women in manufacturing industries (excluding agriculture,transport, building and public employment) were 30 per cent, higher than in Feb-ruary 1947.   Between 1947 and 1950 the cost-of-living index rose by 7 per cent.
. 10. Sweden ;has achieved a good deal of success in the avoidance of industrialstoppages dueito trade disputes., , In the, four-year period 1946-49 the numberof days lost in industrial disputes per 1,000 industrial workers Was as low as 176compared with the comparable figures of 396 for the United Kingdom and 4,495for Australia.&apos;h       .......... E. - Wages Policy in AustraliaGeneral Description of System r.: 1. Minimum1 basic&apos;wages for practically all workers in Australia are fixed by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Rates reflecting thevarious cost-of-living levels in cities and country areas are defined, and additions to the minimum basic wage are also paid for skill or any special conditions ofwork. These &quot; secondary &quot; wages are regulated by industrial awards fixed by theCommonwealth or State tribunals. The various wage determinations are adjustedaccording to variations in the official retail price index, usually at quarterlyintervals.2. Wage negotiations may cover claims for rates in excess of the minimum rates in any industry or particular establishments. The extent to which negotiatedwages may exceed minimum&apos; rates is illustrated by a comparison between the november 1949 average adult male wage of over  9 for a standard working week with a basic wage in the capital cities ranging at the same date from  6 5s. to  6 12s.A recent Commonwealth Court decision has increased the male basic minimum ratesby 205. per week and the same award has raised all female rates from a normal range of 54 to 60 per cent, of men&apos;s rates to 75 per cent.3. Payment of the appropriate wages (including wages in excess of minimum rates secured by the Arbitration awards) is enforced by official inspectors. It isalso recognised that trade union officials may help in the observance of wageconditions, and they have a right of entry to working premises and of examinationof time and wage records.4. The provisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Actsrepresent a comprehensive scheme of regulation of industrial relations, but onlyunions which have been accepted under the registration procedure may make useof the procedures set up by the Acts. The registration procedure entails a certain measure of regulation and restraint in a trade union&apos;s freedom of action, e.g., itsrules must be approved, it may be required to conduct a secret ballot of its members,or to admit new members. Interference in union domestic affairs would not,however, be likely to occur so long as the trade union was democratically basedand administered on well-ordered lines. In any cases of unofficial strike action,a union would be expected to exert every effort to terminate it by refusing strikepay and by fining or expelling delinquent members. The general view held by australian workers and their leaders is that registration in existing conditionsconfers substantial advantages and few workers&apos; organisations are un-registered.5. The policy of the Australian Government in relation to wages appears to aim at an orderly increase in the value of real wages and minimum wage rates have risen by over 100 per cent, since 1937. Control of prices and rents has beenretained since the war period and the average of such costs are about 35 per cent,above the 1939 level.Legislative Basis of such a System6. The adoption in this country of arrangements similar to those in force inAustralia would require legislation far beyond the provisions contained in theIndustrial Courts Act 1919 and the Wages Council Acts, and would require new and comprehensive legislation which would provide inter alia:  *(a) The setting up of an Industrial Court with powers to make awards fixingminimum rates of wages, working hours, overtime, holiday, &amp;c, arrange-ments, percentages of apprentices, &amp;c, in respect of any employments.(b) The regulation of industrial unions of employers and workers by means of asystem of registration with the Court. The Court would need powers torequire unions of workers or employers to provide reasonable facilitiesfor the admission of new members or to remove conditions which mightbe regarded as unreasonable, tyrannical or oppressive.39716d
\c) The filing with the Court of copies of industrial agreements made between employers and workers; such agreements to be enforceable on theparties to it as if it were an award of the Court or, if the Court sodeclares, upon all other workers and employers within the area coveredby the agreement.(d) The prohibition of strikes and lock-outs unauthorised by the associationof workers or employers concerned. Strikes and lock-outs not to beauthorised until all members affected have had an opportunity of voting in secret ballot on the matter in dispute.(e) Penalties for breach of these provisions to be imposed in amounts not to exceed  100 against employers or workers&apos; unions and not exceeding  10against other parties.ConclusionsMain Features of System7. The Australian system has endeavoured to provide a legislative framework for minimum wages, leaving freedom of negotiation for &quot; secondary wages.&quot; Thesystem provides full facilities for conciliation and arbitration and regulates theconduct of wage-negotiating bodies. Although strikes and lock-outs may takeplace, unofficial direct action is forbidden by law and legal strikes, &amp;c, must be preceded by secret ballot of workers.8. This system of free negotiation, coupled with a statutory wages floor,encourages the upward movement of minimum rates to underpin customary rateswhen wages are tending to rise; and acts as a brake on the downward movementof wages if the current tendency is for wages to fall.Working of the System9. In recent years there has been a strong tendency for wages to move upwardsand as soon as the general level of wages fixed by agreement or by Court Awardsoutruns the basic minimum rates an application for a general increase is usuallymade to the Court. The Award made in October which increased men&apos;s basicwages by 20s. and raised the percentage of women&apos;s wages will, in practice, beadded to almost all existing rates, but the general raising of the wages floor willnot necessarily slow down the tempo of new wage negotiations in any industry. Thesystem can therefore accelerate a tendency towards inflation.10. The Australian Index of Weekly Wage rates, which covers all the mainemployments, shows that between March 1947 and March 1950 men&apos;s wages roseby 25 per cent, and women&apos;s rates by 42 per cent. During this period the average level earnings rose by 37 per cent, and the cost of living by 29 per cent. None ofthese percentages increases take account of the general increases in basic ratesawarded by the Commonwealth Court in October.11. The provision made under Australian law for conciliation and arbitrationhas not been successful in avoiding industrial disputes. The recent railway strike in Victoria resulted in an agreement between the workers and the employers, butthe Conciliation Commissioner has refused to ratify the agreement on the grounds that it was made under duress of strike action and Railway workers in other partsof Australia have joined the strike in protest against the Conciliation Commissioner^ruling. From 1946 to 1949 the number of days lost per 1,000 industrial workersthrough stoppages was 4,495. This figure is more than ten times higher than the comparable figure for the United Kingdom.F. Wage Policy in New ZealandGeneral Description of system. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1936 included a require-ment that the Arbitration Court should fix a basic wage &quot; sufficient to maintain a man, wife and three children in a fair and reasonable standard of comfort.&quot; Inaddition, the Court fixes standard rates for unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers by means of periodic pronouncements. Wages may also be negotiated atrates exceeding the standard rates, and any disputed claim may become the subjectof a binding award.2. The need to stabilise wages and prices during the early war years led to regulations which laid down principles for the guidance of Wages Commissioners
and the Arbitration Court. The stabilisation policy did not debar wage increases to maintain industrial differentials; or to meet economic changes, including varia-tions in the cost of living. The effect of the stabilisation policy is shown by an index of nominal weekly-wage rates which moved from 1,132 in 1940 to 1,597 in 1948,i.e., an increase of about 40 per cent.3. The control of prices of commodities, services and of rents tended toincrease the value of real wages. For example, the war-time price index showed anincrease of about 10 per cent, between 1942 and 1948.4. In addition to State regulation of minimum wages, the relations ofassociations of employers and workers is also governed by law. All workers whoare subject to any wage award or industrial agreement registered under the 1936Act must become members of a trade union and employers may not ordinarilyemploy non-members. Only unions duly registered under the Act can take advan-tage of its provisions, which includes the right of union officials to enter employers&apos;premises under a direction of the Court. Due notice of impending strike or lock-outactions must be given to the Minister of Labour so that action for conciliation orinvestigation may take place. Secret ballots of members regarding strike action maybe taken by the Registrar of Industrial Unions.Legislative Basis of such a System5. The laws relating to industrial relations in New Zealand are most com-prehensive in their scope and the adoption of similar provisions in this country would require new legislation to cover the following points:  (a) The setting up of Arbitration Courts to fix basic wages for the reasonablesubsistence of a typical family unit, to cover all occupations. The Courtmust also fix periodically, standard rates above the basic rates to reflectdegrees of industrial skill and issue binding awards on industrial condi-tions which are in dispute.(b) The issue by Government of guiding principles for determination of wagelevels.(c) the regulation of associations of employers and workers by a system of registration.(d) Universal membership of trade unions and the requirement that employersmust not ordinarily employ non-unionist workers.(e) Prior notice to the Minister of Labour of impending strike or lock-outaction to allow for Government conciliation, investigation or ballotaction to be taken.ConclusionsMain Features of System6. The New Zealand pattern of industrial relations is based upon legalminimum subsistence rates for all workers leaving freedom of negotiation for higher rates reflecting skill and other factors. The status of trade unions andtheir members is safeguarded by law and the State provides a full system of concilia-tion and arbitration for industrial disputes and, in theory, prohibits strikes.Working of system a  policy of stabilised wages and prices was adopted early in the warand the Governments directive to wage Arbitral bodies seems to have been successful in avoiding excessive increases. Acute labour shortages, however, leadto intense competition for workers and as wages could not be increased, expensiveamenities were offered by some employments to attract or retain new workers. TheGovernment directive was withdrawn in April 1950 and the effect of a return to free negotiation cannot yet be measured.An Index of weekly wage rates covering all the main employments in new Zealand shows that men&apos;s wages increased between March 1947 and march 1950 by 18 per cent., compared with a cost-of-living rise of 14 percent.Although elaborate provision has been made for conciliation and arbitrationprocedures as a means of avoiding stoppages of work due to industrial disputes in recent years, New Zealand has lost proportionately three times as many daysper 1,000 workers as Great Britain. During the four years 1946-1949 1.189 dayswere lost for every 1,000 of the New Zealand industrial population.
