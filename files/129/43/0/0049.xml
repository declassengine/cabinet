211hi JL siOFFICIAL COAL COMMITTEESHIPPING FOR COAL imports memorandum by the Chairman.Purchases of coal to date in the United States by the national coal Board amount to 825,000 tons.     Further purchases are contem-plated but buying has been temporarily suspended until additionalshipping for the early cargoes has been obtained.     Besides theNational Coal Board purchases, about 50,000 tons of coal a month willbe required to replace the supplies which have hitherto been taken bythe overseas bunker depots from the United Kingdom.2. I have considered with representatives of the Board of Trade,the Ministry.of Food, the Ministry of Fuel and Power, the Common-wealth Relations Office, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry ofSupply the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the shipping of this coal.     It has been possible so far to arrange shipping sufficientto deliver 100,000 tons in Jandary and the possibility of chartering threefurther ships with a tonnage of 25,000 is being considered.     The only other shipping which might be obtained is as follows:-(a) The Shipping Lines say that if the Government are prepared togive priority to transport of coal they are prepared to surrender theircharter arrangements for twenty tramp steamers which might be usedto deliver a maximum of 150,000 to 200,000 tons of coal in January and february.     Discussions have not yet taken place with the owners of theships and the question whether compensation might have to be paid for breach of contract by failure to deliver other goods if they were diverted to coal-carrying requires detailed examination.     The effect of divertingthe ships to coal-carrying would be to postpone certain exports ofprefabricated houses to Australia, cement to New Zealand and fertilisersto China and Japan.(b) There is available one ship scheduled to carry wheat from aNorth Atlantic port which could be diverted to carry 8/9,000 tons ofcoal to arrive in January.(c) There is the possibility that the Americans might allow the useof some of their &quot;mothball&quot; fleet.3. In view of the urgency of importing the maximum amount ofcoal possible I feel it necessary to recommend certain immediate measures, even though the Departments concerned have felt itnecessary to reserve their position.     These are;-(i)     as many as possible of the tramps in charter by the shipping lines sho-uld be diverted to carry coal;

(ii)     the &quot;Cape Nelson&quot; which is chartered to carry wheatshould similarly be diverted;(iii)     an early opportunity should be taken to persuade the americans to take a further twenty-five ships out oftheir &quot;mothball&quot; fleet since, with the aid of theseAmerican ships, the Ministry of Transport think thatit may be possible to arrange sufficient shipping inFebruary and March to handle the coal which hasbeen bought by the National Coal Board.(Signed)   E.N.
