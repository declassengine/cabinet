(50) 31313th December, 1950CABINETCONDITIONS   OF   EMPLOYMENT  AND   NATIONAL   ARBITRATIONORDERDispute between Kemsley Newspapers, Limited, and Members of the &quot; DailyGraphic &quot; and Kemsley Newspapers (London) Chapels of the National Unionof JournalistsMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service wish to draw the attention of ray colleagues to a development concerningthe Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order (S.R. &amp; O. 1940,No. 1305), which may be of some importance. The solicitors acting on behalf oftwo chapels of the National Union of Journalists employed by Kemsley NewspapersLimited are asking the High Court for an order of mandamus requiring me to deal inaccordance with Order 1305 with an alleged trade dispute between them and their employers.2. After a long correspondence with the solicitors acting for the two chapels,the only matter which I was advised might possibly constitute a trade disputeis a comparatively minor one concerning the alleged wrongful dismissal of aparticular worker. So far as I can get to the bottom of the trouble, it appears tobe rooted in a general sense of dissatisfaction on the part of the chapels with theway in which the management conducts its dealings with their members. Thesolicitors acting for the chapels have supplied details of instances in the past wherethe firm are alleged to have acted harshly in dismissing workers or in other wayshave not acted fairly towards the men.3. The actual issue before the Court would appear to turn on whether thesegrumbles and grievances about the unsatisfactory nature of the arrangements withthe firm amount to a trade dispute under Order 1305. T have taken the view, onadvice, that vague and somewhat indefinite grievances about the general conductof the firm are not matters which fall within the scope of Order 1305.4. The question, however, whether or not I was right on the trade disputepoint is not the aspect of the matter which I am now raising.5. It appears clear that in reporting this alleged dispute the chapels were acting without the authority of the National Executive of their Union. Indeed, whenthe chapels first raised the question of a trade dispute with me they were concerned about an alleged breach of the procedural agreement in relation to a particularworker who had been dismissed by Kemsley Newspapers Limited. This particulargrievance was, in accordance with the agreed procedure, considered and &quot; settled &quot;by the National Executive Committee of the National Union of Journalists. Never-theless, the two chapels refused to accept this &quot;settlement &quot; and it seems clear thatin the line they have taken since they have been at variance with their Union.Indeed, when the chapels approached the National Executive of their Union aboutthe alleged unsatisfactory relationship between them and their employers, theUnion undertook to pursue the matter with the employers if the chapels withdrewtheir attempt to report a dispute under the Order.  This the chapels refused to do.39780
6. There is here therefore a plain case of a group of workers attempting toset in motion the machinery of Order 1305 against the wishes of their Union and presumably if the High Court in this action were to take the view that a trade dispute has been reported under the Order it might be necessary for me to consideraction under Article 2 of that Order for the purpose of effecting a settlement.7. If this should happen it will bring to the forefront an aspect of the order which so-far has not been of much practical importance. There have, of course,been many cases of workers taking part in a strike on a matter which has not beenreported under the Order. But, reports of disputes under the Order by unorganisedworkers are almost unknown and the practice has been that when a report is received from a trade union official he is invariably, asked by the Ministry (as was done in this case) whether he has the authority of his Executive. In the ten years during which the Order has been in force the number of cases in which tradeunion members insisted on reporting a dispute against the wishes of their Executivehas been so small as to be negligible.8. If, however, as the result of this case these &quot; rebellious &quot; chapels succeed in setting the machinery of the Order in motion it may quite possibly lead to anextension of this sort of practice so that a disgruntled group of workers (for example,dockers) might report disputes against the advice of their own trade union. Thiswould be a development which I have no doubt would be intensely resented by thetrade unions who would naturally take the view that it was directly underminingtheir authority. It is true that the Order as.it stands in theory permits this sort of thing, but, as I have stated above the practice has been verv different. It is ofcourse not possible to forecast how the National Arbitration Tribunal would regard a case which they knew was not supported by the workers&apos; own trade union.9. I gather that the provision in Article 2(3) of the Order requiring me to take any steps which seem to me expedient might be interpreted as enabling me to take no steps in a case where I do not consider any steps are in fact expedient. I under-stand from the Law Officers that that at any rate is an arguable proposition and itwould mean that where I take that view I would be under no obligation to refer thetrade dispute to the National Arbitration Tribunal under Article 2(4) of the Order.Where one is dealing with an unofficial movement there are, of course, good policyreasons for looking with a cold eye on any attempt by the workers concerned to invoke the machinery of the Order. Probably it is only in a case of that sort thatit would be practicable to refuse to take any action under the Order when a trade dispute has been reported. Inaction under the Order, however, would enable legalstrike action to be taken after 21 days from the report of the dispute.10. There is also the case of the unofficial strike which started without therehaving been any report under the Order. That is clearly illegal. The dispute might,however, be reported under the Order after the strike has started: perhaps by theemployers, and it might be considered inexpedient to take any steps under theOrder while the workers concerned were taking part in an illegal strike. Sucha refusal would not, of course, legalise the strike as to the past, but it is at any ratedoubtful whether the strike would continue to be illegal after the dispute had beenreported and 21 days had elapsed without the matter having been referred for settlement in acordance with Article of the Order.11. Thus the dilemma presented in these cases is between doing nothing and thereby facilitating a legal strike or putting a term to an illegal one, or, on theother hand, referring an unofficial trade dispute for settlement under the Order and thereby accentuating the difficulties of the trade unions in controlling their members.12. In view of the above considerations I am watching this case with particularinterestG. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,13th December, 1950
