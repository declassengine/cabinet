THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1950CONFIDENTIAL - Copy No.    3CP. (50) 29130th November, 1950CABINETWAGES POLICY: THE BRITISH system memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. In my Paper (CP. (50) 292 I have described the wages systems in operation in certain foreign countries. As a complementary paper I circulate herewith adescription of the British system together with some observations on its working and on the method of centralised control.2. It is frequently stated that we, in this country, have no wages policy; thatour system of settling wages (some critics refuse to give it the dignity of a &quot; policy &quot;)is illogical, haphazard, out of date, unsuited to the conditions of a modern plannedeconomy and attended by grave risk in existing inflationary conditions of inducinga competitive race in wages. In particular, it is said that to rely upon voluntaryrestraint and the good sense of the trade unions and employers&apos; organisations and upon the normal processes of collective bargaining to bring about reasonable results in conditions of full employment and shortage of and competition for man-powernot only is unwise but is fraught with possibilities that may endanger our economic stability.3. The statement that we dojnptjiay-fi a wages policy is, as my colleagues know,completely inaccurate. We do have- a wages policy a policy which has been evolved out of our unique experience of industrial relations over more than 100years, and which is flexible and capable of being adapted to circumstances. Inits present form that policy can be stated broadly in simple terms-in that sector ofindustry where organisation is not sufficiently strong to make collective bargainingeffective, to fix minimum conditions of employment through the medium ofstautory wage-regulating machinery, and in the rest of industry to rely uponvoluntary collective bargaining between organisations of employers and workers;these methods are supported at the moment by the provisions of S.R. &amp; O. 1305/40(Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order) relating to compulsory arbitration and other matters and by Government guidance on the economic stateof the nation given to industry as a whole from time to time.4. This wages policy has evolved from the policy of successive Governmentsover many decades of encouraging the growth of workers&apos; and, more recently, ofemployers&apos; organisations. A great step forward was made at the end of the first world War, following the Whitley Report, by the establishment of Joint industrial councils in many industries having no joint negotiating machinery. At present there are some 130 of these Councils.5. There are two basic features that commonly apply in all the majorindustries. First, piece-work rates, payment by results schemes, bonus systems,merit money and other payments individually applied are settled in the factory; and second, national wage rates are settled at national level. Questions on the first thatraise points of principle can and usually do find their way for settlement to thenational level if local settlement proves impossible. Questions of interpretation onthe second are frequently settled locally if no point of major principle is involved.There is at all stages provision for joint negotiation and discussion; at all stages a sense of responsibility is developed and management and men have opportunities to39713
get to know each other on matters of common interest. The joint bodies, both local and national, are just as frequently concerned about matters such as welfare thatare outside the field of controversy. This means that the system is constructive inits approach to common problems and encourages a feeling of joint interest andco-operation. The trade unions are, of course, welded together in the Trades UnionCongress. Equally, employers have a common meeting ground through the british employers&apos; Confederation and there is a considerable amount of co-ordination inan informal, but, nevertheless, practical way. There, is no doubt that individual industries and industry as a whole derive great benefit from the.fact, that these negotiations on price fixing, settlement of national wage rates, &amp;c, are in the handsof experts, with an intimate knowledge of their own industry and its repercussions on other industries which would be most difficult to acquire except as a result of practical working.6. Even where it was recognised that organisation was weak and that the worker required protection, Trade Board legislation, which was introduced in 1909to enable minimum statutory rates to be established in &quot; sweated &quot; industries, gave the largest possible measure of freedom to the representatives of the employers andthe workers to fix their own rates; the independent members could only act in theevent of disagreement. The Wages Councils Act, which superseded the trade boards Act, was deliberately designed to give an even larger responsibility to thetwo sides. To-day, there are sixty Wages Councils; in addition, there are statutoryarrangements in agriculture and catering.7. Thus to-day, apart from catering and agriculture and the trades in whichthere are Wages Councils, the two sides of industry have the entire responsibilityfor fixing wages. This voluntary system of collective bargaining ensures that wagescan be adjusted to meet the ever-changing conditions of trade and of social circum-stances and thought. It is able to respond quickly and effectively to any calls madeon it, and by long tradition the leaders of both sides are men of responsible out lookand ability.Practical Working of System8. While our system is perhaps illogical, and while movements of wages donot take place on a uniform basis for all industries, the outstanding fact is that thesystem works in practice and works astonishingly well; so well that it is a commonexperience for those who meet industrialists, trade unionists or Government repre-sentatives from abroad, whether in conference or individually, to receive expressions of admiration for our system of industrial relations and of the desire that their countries had so good a system.9. The post-war results of the operation of this system are striking. In the3\ years since June 1947 the wages index has risen by only 10 points while the retail prices index has risen by 14 points; in the past eighteen months a period ofconsiderable economic stress involving devaluation of the   sterling it has risenonly one point; since January of this year it has been stable at 110. There are signs that a cycle of wage increases has now begun, but it is equally true that thecost of living is rising and is causing increasing concern to the workers and their leaders.10. Fortunately, also, the post-war period has been marked by a most satis-factory freedom from major industrial disputes. The beneficial effects of this on production and on our efforts to recovery generally cannot be too stronglyemphasised. The record this year is even more striking and unless there is some major upheaval before the end of the year, we can look forward to a result forthe year that will stand comparison with any year in the last half century.Centralised Control11. I am sure that we should be making a grave mistake if we abandoned asystem which has given such favourable results for the more extreme features, suchas central control or regulation of all wages, of the foreign wage systems I have described in CP. (50) 292. When one considers the manifold problems that havefaced some of our great industries since the war and which they have settled through their own machinery in such a manner as to give the utmost confidence to our general economy, it seems impossible not to acknowledge the great benefits whichwe derive from our system. Centralised control not only has not been shown togive as good results as our own system in many cases it is clear that the results
are definitely inferior; they are contrary to our tradition and alien to thetemperament of our people; to introduce them here would involve legislation of themost contentious kind; their introduction would be bitterly opposed by the general body of trade unionists; and for their successful operation further controls and heavy sanctions are essential. It is significant that France, after some years ofexperiment&apos;with the centralised regulation of wages, has recently reverted to thesystem of collective bargaining.1 2. Moreover, the establishment here of a centralised system of control must rest on a statutory foundation and the settlements will be arrived at by what is,in effect, legal process. Such settlements, in the very nature of things, lack flexibility.Mistakes cannot be rectified with any speed or ease. Experience in this country,and more recently in Australia, shows how disadvantageous that can be. It willbe recalled that the very serious road haulage strike in this country three years agostarted through a dispute on the Road Haulage Wages Board. Organisation was strong on both sides but the statutory procedure was cumbrous and rigid and theonly way to secure a settlement and a resumption of work was to set up a voluntaryJoint Industrial Council in a matter of a few days. In Australia, more recently, adecision by an arbitrator to refuse to accept a settlement arrived at between thetwo sides has precipitated a Federal-wide stoppage on the railways. Where thereis strength of organisation on either side, a sensitive flexible machine is absolutely essential.13. Further, I would impress upon my colleagues the difficulty, once weembark upon the course of state control of wages, of excluding discussion of actualwage rates from the House of Commons. Even if such discussion were confined tothe amount of statutory national minima, we could not expect a reasonable result to be arrived at in an atmosphere so charged with political feeling. The introductionof a statutory minimum wage in the United States of America by president roosevelt was received with grave misgiving by some of the most progressive people in that country; that misgiving was not lessened by the lighthearted decision by congress a year ago to raise the national minimum to 75 cents an hour.14. Finally, I cannot over-emphasise the tremendous importance of avoiding any action that might seem to weaken the authority of the leaders of the two sides ofindustry on whom such a grave responsibility rests. If the final responsibility for settlement is taken from the two sides of organised industry, their actions will tend tobecome irresponsible. Settlements will be left to the final authority and individual industries will cease to make the wage adjustments essential to a flexible economy;wage increases extending over the whole of industry will become the rule, with the consequent periodic risk of a major upheaval; and any chance of securing reductions to meet economic circumstances is likely to be seriously jeopardised. Such a system would, in fact, have dangerous inflationary tendencies.Conclusions15. My examination of the various systems leads me to the conclusion thatour line of development should be to foster and encourage the utmost self-government in industry. Some industries, such as coal mining, cotton weaving, bootand shoe, flour milling, steel, electricity supply, and London transport, have complete voluntary negotiating machinery and have their own arbitration arrange-ments and almost invariably settle their own problems, much to the benefit of thecountry. I propose to discuss with representatives of industry the possibility of the fuller development of negotiating and arbitration machinery within each industry with a view to encouraging them more and more to settle their own problems.16. There is one further point. As I have said, the present collective bargainingsystem in this country has been supported in the last three to four years by government guidance on the economic state of the nation given to industry as awhole from time to time. I am not satisfied that we have yet developed the most satisfactory method of giving this very necessary guidance. If both sides ofindustry would themselves voluntarily establish a joint body to give such guidance,on information supplied by Government, or if they would allow my National joint advisory Council to be used for this purpose, this would, I think, be a great step forward. I suggest that the two sides of industry should be asked to consider thepossible ways in which wage negotiating bodies can best be kept informed of the
Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,30th November, 1950economic situation and its implications for industry. But I must tell my colleagues that the timing of any approach to the T;U.C. is most important as it would in my view be highly inopportune to approach the T.U.C. with new proposals at themoment, both because we are at present in the middle of a wages movement whichmust work itself out before anything effective can be done, and because it is essentialto give the T.U.C. time to recover from the rebuff which the General Councilsuffered at the last Congress.G.
