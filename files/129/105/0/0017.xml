3.        Uncontrolled coloured immigration on this scale is putting a severe strain on the housing situation in the areas in which these people congregate,and there is growing parliamentary and public concern about the social consequences.   Although there is at present relatively little unemploymentamongst the coloured community the situation in a recession would be quiteserious.   The quality of the immigrants appears to be deteriorating.4.        Faced with this very large increase in numbers the Committee areunanimously of the opinion that the present state of affairs should not beallowed to continue and that the Government should introduce legislation to enable immigration from the Commonwealth to be controlled.   In coming to this conclusion they fully recognise that this action would infringe the historic right of Commonwealth citizens freely to enter and stay in theUnited Kingdom, and also that however carefully the legislation were draftedit would be represented as a measure of discrimination against coloured people.   Nevertheless the Committee are agreed that unless action is taken this country may well be confronted in the space of a few years with acolour problem approaching that of the United States.5. There is an important point of timing.   In the first half of June theColonial Secretary is holding a conference in London with &quot;West indian political leaders, as a result of which it is hoped to launch the West IndiesFederation into independence seme time next year.   Futrthermore in theautumn there is likely to be a referendum in Jamaica (which would be particularly hit by any restriction on immigrationto the United Kingdom) on-1-SECHETC;J6ll67 COPY NO.26thJ^aXi.l96lCABINETCOMMONWEALTH MIGRANTSMemojrandujm ,byJJbie JLc,ir d, j^aji cjg norOn 16th February the Cabinet invited me to arrange for the Committeeon Commonwealth Migrants to consider the form which legislation to control immigration from the Commonwealth might take, and to bring the matter again before the Cabinet in due course (C. C. (6l) 7th Conclusions, Minute 2).2.        Eefore I deal specifically with this question the Cabinet may wish toknow of the recent scale of coloured immigration into this country.   In thefirst four months of 1961 nearly 32, 000 coloured immigrants arrived from theCommonwealth, co rrpared with 9, 300 in the corresponding period of I960.The total net intake for I960 as a whole * itself a peak year - was 58, 000,and if the present trend continues the total for 1961 will be 150, 000 or ieven 200, 000.   This compares with a natural increase of about 200, 000per annum of the resident population of England and Wales.   By the end ofthis year there would be nearly half a milli6:.   coloured persons in the UnitedKingdom, and the figure might well rise to 2 millions within the nextfifteen years.   The vast majority of these immigrants are West Indians(18,500 so far this year), Indians and Pakistanis (5,000 in each case).
the issue of federation and it is of vital importance that Mr. Manley&apos;s party should win it.   For these reasons the Committee recommend that no public announcement of our intentions should be made until towards the end ofOctober at the earliest.   The Committee hope that the Bill could find anearly place in the legislative programme for the next session of Parliament.The Colonial Secretary is of opinion however that the question is bound tobe raised while the West Indian leaders are over here for the constitutional conference, and if so he feels he would be bound to tell the Jamaican Premierand perhaps ether senior Ministers privately that the Government were considering the introduction of legislation later in the year.6.        As to the form of control the Committee have examined three possible methods:-(a) A control based on possession of a certificate that housing accommodation is available for the immigrant.(b) A control by means of a health check.(c) Some form of employment control.7. The Committee do not  think that control through a housing certificatewould be workable:   the practical difficulties are too great.   Nor do they thinkthat control by means of a health check would by itself  be effective:   thevast majority of immigrants would fairly readily pass a simple check ofthis nature.8,        The Committee consider that the only practical method of control would be one based on employment criteria (course (c)).   They have givenpreliminary consideration to such a scheme which might be based on thefollowing lines:-(a) Skilled workers, and immigrants coming to a specific job witha named employer for which no resident labour was avaiable, would beallowed in without restriction.(b) Other potential immigrants would have to apply by post to theMinistry of Labour, who would grant permits on a &quot;first come  first served&quot;basis, but with absolute control over the rate of flow.The rate of flow would be a major Government decision based on the economicsocial and political conditions at the time.9.        The great merit of this form of control would be its flexibility,since the Government could decide at any time how many immigrantswere to be admitted in the ensuing period.   Another advantage would be thatit could be operated without any distinction on grounds of race or colour,although in practice since most of the immigrants from the old commonwealth countries would be either skilled workers or would be coming to a specificjob they would be unlikely to be much affected.   It would be comparativelysimple to take  power at the same time to refuse admission to any immigranton health grounds.
10.       There are however a number of difficulties in this scheme whichwill need much more examination.   For instance;  how are we to identify the group of people who will continue to be admitted to the United kingdom without restriction;  by citizenship, residence, birth?   Can we exemptimmigrants from the Irish Republic from the control;  and if so how can we stop coloured persons evading the control by entering the United Kingdomvia that country?   How would the control be reconciled with a possiblecommitment, if we joined the Six, to allow freedom of movement of personsinto the United Kingdom from the Community countries ?   Should we also take power to deport those immigrants who prove themselves undesirableor who do not fulfil the conditions of admission to this country?  And besidesthese questions there aire many practical difficulties to be overcome at the ports.11.        The Committee have remitted these points for further detailed examination by officials, and they propose to give further considerationto them at an early date, with a view to making another report to theCabinet before the summer recess.12.       In the meantime on behalf of the Committee I seek my colleagues&apos;endorsement of the courses outlined in this memorandum.K.Lord chancellor s Department,S. W.l.26th May, 1961-3-
