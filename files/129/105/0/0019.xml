C. (61) 69 COPY NO.26^hMayjJ26lCABINETCO MM ON W E A LTH MIGRANTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsSince I was unable to attend the discussion in the Committee on commonwealth M grants on 17th May, I am circulating to my colleagues thefollowing comments on the proposals contained in the Lord Chancel lor&apos;smemorandum (C. (61) 67).2. I am in complete agreement with the need to impose somerestrictions on immigrants from the Commonwealth but there are certain aspects of the Committee&apos;s proposals about which I do not feel very happy.3. The Committee did not think that a control based on either a housing certificate or a health check would by itself be- effective.   I am not certain, however, that such controls could not and should not be used as additional checks.   Subject to this, I agree broadly with the proposedmethod of control based on employment criteria, but I have the two followingpoints.   First, is there not a danger of large-scale immigration from thosecoming to specified jobs, if employers in this country set up recruitingorganisations in countries with a large population surplus?   For example,London Transport Executive might recruit large numbers of West Idians.Secondly, I think that to deal with unskilled immigrants on the basis of&quot;first corned first served&quot; might not be in the national interest.   Should notthe Ministry of Labour be e-.nabled to select the type of person who would fitinto the kind of employment where there is a shortage of labour, and beempowered to attach conditions to ensure that these people remain in that employment for a minimum period?   For example, if the need were   primarily for female hospital workers, it should be possible to give priority to applicants suitable for these jobs in preference to, say, unskilled labourers.4.        I suggest that, in addition to the points listed in paragraph 10 ofC. (6l) 67 for further consideration, there is also the question whether thereshould be some selection of unskilled immigrants in their country of origin.Furthermore, if it is agreed that we should take power to deport, we shouldalso consider whether we ought not to extend the twelve-month waiting period before British subjects can acquire United Kingdom citizenship by virtueof residence in this country.5. Like other members of the Committee, I am unhappy about theidea of giving to citizens of the Irish Republic privileges which will not beenjoyed by Commonwealth citizens, though I see the practical difficulties of imposing restrictions.   I am, however, glad to know that this question isbeing looked at further.D. S.Commonwealth Relations Office,S. W. 1.26th May, .1961m
