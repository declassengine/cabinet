Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1961C. (61) 74 Copy No.      5 38th June, 1961CABINETSUEZ FINANCE company memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerLast December I consulted my colleagues about disposal of the Government^shareholding in the Suez Finance Company. While, as I then explained, therewere no longer any reasons of policy for the Government to retain their holding in this Company, it was decided that further consideration should be given tothe financial advantages and disadvantages of an early sale and to the method ofdisposal.  (C.C. (60) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 11.)2. There have hitherto been two main reasons for thinking that the market price of the shares might be abnormally depressed. First there were doubts aboutthe Egyptians meeting their compensation liabilities. These should have beeneased by prompt payment of the further instalment due last January: of the totalof  29 millions only two more instalments of  4-1 millions now remain to be paidin 1962 and 1963. Secondly, there was uncertainty in the minds of the investingpublic about the value of the underlying assets. The announcement in October ofthe value of the Company&apos;s assets should by now have had its effect.3. There is thus no apparent advantage on either of these counts in delayingsale any longer. There might even be some risk in deferring a sale until thecompletion of the compensation payments in 1963, after which the prospect offurther distributions will no longer be acting as a bait to potential buyers.4. In my previous memorandum I considered the most appropriate time for disposal in connexion with the pressure likely to arise, once a sale had been announced, for an increase in the  27 - 5 millions compensation fund provided bythe Anglo-Egyptian settlement for former owners of property in Egypt. Myconclusion then from which my colleagues did not dissent was that an earlysale would be more advantageous than a later one. The announcement meanwhileof the second interim distribution of this compensation strengthens this conclusion.Although I still expect that we shall be pressed to increase the compensation fundif we declare our intention to dispose of the shareholding, the recent distributionshould take some of the force out of this pressure.5. It was suggested in the discussion in December that expert opinion shouldbe obtained on the future prospects of the Company. In the nature of things, thisis not a matter on which it has been possible to seek the advice of ordinaryinvestment consultants. The position has, however, been very fully discussed with the Bank of England and with the Government Directors. Their consideredadvice is that, while the Company&apos;s future looks generally promising, the promiseis essentially a long-term one and the market price already makes considerableallowance for it. Reference was also made in the discussion to the Company&apos;interests in Saharan oil and in the Channel Tunnel Study Group. These are, i suggest, too small, too long-term and too speculative to justify, deferring a saleon their account.6. There appear therefore to be no special reasons for thinking that to delaya sale for, say, two or three years more would be profitable. In any event, adisposal operation of this size can be carried through successfully only on a rising59131
market. The shares have been a strong market since the beginning of the year,rising 25 per cent, in value between early January and the end of March. Recentprice movements have been in line with those of other quotations on the Bourse.The shares quickly threw off the effects of the Algerian revolt and are now aboutback at their best levels. There is much to be said for taking advantage of thegenerally favourable trend., 7. If this opinion is accepted, the method of sale has to be considered.? There are two main ways of disposal: by a block deal with a syndicate of some kind, or piecemeal, in the market, in amounts related to the appetite of the market.In deciding between them, our primary concern must be to secure the best possibleprice and, so far as is possible, one that is demonstrably so. But there are other considerations to be borne in mind. There are a number of banking and otherconcerns in the United Kingdom and abroad (including the United States) whoseinterest in acquiring this shareholding we have recognised; and to Rothschilds,who have a traditional association with the Company, we have given anundertaking that they will have a prior indication of any decision to sell. Alsothere are about 400 other British shareholders with small holdings in the Company.Although Her Majesty&apos;s Government have no specific obligations towards them,we should wish, if possible, to adopt a method of sale which gave them the chance to increase their holdings. Finally, in disposing of our important holding in this company Her Majesty&apos;s Government would naturally wish to have regard also tothe French interests, including both private shareholders and wider political aspects.8. Disposal by means of a block deal with a syndicate has some obviousattractions. It could be carried out more quickly than disposal through the market and, since some large financial houses have already expressed interest, it should notbe difficult to find buyers.9. But there are serious disadvantages. The field of potential bidders for so large a holding is bound to be limited. Even if bids were invited from all who haveexpressed interest, there might be an absence of effective competition due tocombination between potential bidders, of which there have already been some signs. The negotiated price might well be subject to criticism at the Public accounts committee and elsewhere. It would be difficult to take any account, within a blocksale, of the interests of other British shareholders. (It is worth recalling that when in June 1959 Her Majesty&apos;s Government disposed of their first holding in the Suezsubsidiary, Societe dlnvestissements Mobiliers, by privately inviting bids from financial groups that had already expressed an interest, there was considerableCity criticism on the grounds that many who would have been interested inacquiring the shares were given no chance to do so.) It might also be difficult tosatisfy the Chairman of the Company and the French Government that we hadsold to a syndicate which would make the best interests of the Company itsconcern. It might even be suggested that we had gratuitously, or even deliberately,put the syndicate into an excessively powerful position in the affairs of the Company.Taken together, these objections to a block sale are formidable.10. The success of the alternative method of sale through the market must depend on the persistence of a lively interest in acquiring the shares. Unless wewere reasonably confident that such an interest existed, it would be mistaken toattempt this procedure. Although the sale through the market of such a largeholding must carry some risk of depressing the price, this would be minimised if itwere made quite clear that there was no intention of forcing sales on an unwillingmarket. I am in fact advised that, carefully handled, a disposal of our holdingthrough the market could be effected not only without depressing the price of the shares but, given reasonably favourable market conditions, at gradually rising prices. How long the operation would take is difficult to say. If our entire holdinghad to be sold piecemeal, it might take anything up to two years or even longer,and a long-drawn-out operation would carry with it the risk of coming to a haltthrough a change in the general market atmosphere. But the chances are that before the market sales had got very far we should have offers for bulk purchases possibly for the Whole of the remainder-of the shares. A block bid underreputable auspices at around or about the current market price would obviouslymave to be considered seriously, but a good deal would depend on the circumstances in which it was made. There is a clear distinction between a block sale at the outset of the operation: which would be open to most of the objections advanced
in paragraph 9 and a block sale of the remainder of the holding after a substantial number of shares has been offered through the market and absorbed by it. In thelatter case all existing shareholders and individuals interested in acquiring shareswould have had the chance to buy, while the Company itself and any other groupsinterested in a large purchase would also have had time to intervene. In thesecircumstances I would foresee no objection in principle to accepting a suitableoffer, but the question can only be considered on its merits at the time.11. I consider, therefore, that the best method of disposal would be to start by selling our shares openly, on the London Market, in blocks related to theappetite of the investor.. (We are advised that, whether we sell to United kingdom or foreign residents, it would be desirable to sell through the London Market.The shares are quoted here and, though Paris is the main market, it would in thecircumstances be normal for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to sell in London.Arbitrage keeps the two markets in line, and selling in London would have theparticular advantage of enabling United Kingdom residents to add to their holdings of overseas assets. In the present case these considerations must outweigh thefact that to sell in Paris would benefit the Reserves.)12. It is next for consideration whether some prior announcement shouldbe made of our decision. Given both the long and important history of the government&apos;s association with the Company and the size and value of our holding,there is, I suggest, a presumption in favour of an announcement in Parliamentabout our intentions. But there are other reasons against undertaking sales throughthe market without a prior announcement. Our holding is so well known andconstitutes so large a proportion of the Company&apos;s total capital that it would beimpossible to prevent such sales becoming public knowledge within a very short time. Such knowledge, if accompanied by ignorance and uncertainty as to her majesty&apos;s Governmenfs real intentions, might well be more damaging to themarket price of the shares than a carefully-worded public announcement thatthe Government, while ready to sell their holding, would only do so at satisfactoryprices. I am advised that the undertone of the market appears firm enough atpresent to enable an announcement of the Governmenfs intentions to be madein this form without more than a temporary depression in the price of the shares.13. If it is agreed that we should proceed as I have proposed, we have alsoto consider to what extent it is necessary or desirable that we should give priorintimation to, or hold prior consultation with, the French Government, the Bankof France, and the Management of the Company. The British GovernmentDirectors have emphasised the great interest which is taken in the Suez FinanceCompany in financial and political circles in Paris and the concern which would be felt as to who our successors on the Board might be. In view of this and the close and friendly relationships which have been maintained in the past, it will naturally be our wish to take the Management and the French Government into our confidence to the fullest extent compatible with the primary objective of obtaining the best possible price on the sale for the Exchequer.14. A decision by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to liquidate its holding would not of itself be likely to cause anxiety to Monsieur Georges-Picot, the Chairman of theCompany (indeed he probably expects it), but the method of disposal might well doso if it were not carefully explained. At the same time, although we should take into account any considerations that the Company may wish to advance, the finaldecision on both points must be that of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Moreover,there might be dangers of leakage prejudicial to the whole operation in too early an intimation of our intentions. I suggest, therefore, that we might proceed in two stages. First, without disclosing that we have any intention to sell, we should letMonsieur Georges-Picot know informally that the future of Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s shareholding does, of course, come under review from time to time,and that we should be glad to know from him whether, if the question of a salearose, there would be any particular points which he would like us to bear in mind,affecting either the question of a sale or the method of disposal. We should then consider any representations that he might make, before coming to a final conclusion. Assuming that the conclusion was to proceed as proposed in this paper,we should, as a matter of courtesy, inform both Monsieur Baumgartner andMonsieur Georges-Picot of our intentions very shortly before the proposed announcement in the House. The Bank of England would probably wish to informthe Bank of France in similar terms.
15. If this procedure is followed, I think that we shall have gone as far as ispossible or reasonable in safeguarding the legitimate interests of the Company and ofthe French authorities. Finally, in order to fulfil our undertakings to thoseinstitutions which have already expressed interest in the possibility of a sale, weshould inform them of our intentions, in suitable terms, immediately before theannouncement in the House.16. Apart from our shareholding, which is worth nearly  17 millions at current market prices, we have a holding of Suez Finance Company 5 per cent,bonds, to a value of about  2  millions. As these carry no voting rights, they are unlikely to be of interest to a buyer of the shares. They are anyway being steadilyredeemed by annual drawings which will dispose of the holding by 1969 at thelatest. I would therefore not propose to attempt to sell them, at any rate at thepresent time.Conclusion17. I recommend, therefore, that we should decide to start disposing of ourshareholding through the London Market, and be prepared thereafter to accept asatisfactory block bid, as soon as the preliminary steps referred to in (a), (b), and (c)below have been taken:(a) We should consult with the Management, and inform the FrenchGovernment and the Bank of France, on the lines indicated inparagraph 14 above. (I would of course consult my colleagues again ifnecessary in the light of any views expressed by Monsieur Georges-Picotat the preliminary interview.)(b) The operation should be preceded by a statement in the House.(c) We should inform the institutions to which we have given undertakingsimmediately before the statement in the House.S.
