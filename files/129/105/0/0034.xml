Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1961-1C. (61) 84 Copy No.21st June, 1961CABINETTHE COMMONWEALTH AND europe note by the Prime MinisterAt a meeting at Chequers last week-end, with a number of my colleagues,I discussed the line which should be followed by the Ministers who will be visitingCommonwealth countries Over the next two or three weeks. Our main conclusion was that the approach to the Commonwealth must be on the basis that it is notpossible to make an assessment of the conditions which would meet our own requirements and those of the Commonwealth which we would need to secure ifwe were to accede to the Treaty of Rome, without entering into negotiations withthe European Economic Community. Therefore, we should apply to accede, inorder to find out what those conditions would be; and we would like the aquiescence of the Commonwealth in this.2. I attach as an annex the directive for these Ministers which has beenprepared in the light of that discussion.3. There is also a meeting of the Ministerial Council of the European free trade Association in London on 27th and 28th June. In view of the impendingdiscussions with the Commonwealth we shall have to be very guarded in what we say to our partners in the Association at this stage, and we shall propose afurther Ministerial meeting with them in July when the Commonwealth talks havebeen completed.H. M.Admiralty House, S.W. 1,21st June, 1961.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
ANNEXDIRECTIVE - FOR UNITED KINGDOM MINISTERS FOR their discussions WITH COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENTSBackgroundAt the meeting of senior Commonwealth officials in London on 25th may the United Kingdom Delegation summed up the position in the following sixpoints :(a) We have as yet had no talks with the Six collectively.   We have hadinformal talks with individual members of the Six (and we may have more). These have been in no sense a negotiation.(b) We now have, on the basis of what we have learned in these talks, to make our own assessment of what terms and special arrangements we might reasonably expect to obtain if we were to decide to negotiate with the six.(c) After that, we intend to put the practical possibilities as we see them beforeother members of the Commonwealth and to discuss fully with them,in relation to their essential interests, what policy should be followed.(d) Similarly we must consult our partners in the European Free trade association.(e) Only after these consultations have taken place will the British cabinet decide whether or not to open negotiations with the Six.(/) If it is decided to negotiate, there will be the need for very close and continuous consultation and I mean consultation, not merely liaison with other Commonwealth countries. We should have to consider whatspecial arrangements were needed.2. We do not now believe that we can make a realistic assessment of the&quot; terms and special arrangements we might reasonably expect to obtain &quot; (point (b)above) without actually entering into negotiations with the Six. We now wish todiscuss with the Commonwealth what are the essential interests which we should try to safeguard in a negotiation to accede to the Treaty of Rome.Purposes of the Visits(a) To explain the political case3. The first purpose will be to explain and discuss with commonwealth ministers the broad political considerations which point to the conclusion that theonly effective way of securing our political objectives in the world, and of avertingthe dangers of continued division in Europe which we foresee, lies in full UnitedKingdom membership of the European Economic Community.  Ministers would
say that the United Kingdom Government- on their own judgment of these broadpolitical considerations as well as of the general economic arguments are mindedto join the Six, provided that special arrangements can be negotiated-with theCommunity on matters involving the essential interests of,the Commonwealth (andalso of United Kingdom agriculture and of our partners in the European free trade Association). In order to discover what special arrangements can be made,it is the view of the United Kingdom Government that it will be necessary tO enterinto negotiations for accession to the Community. It will also be. necessary totake into account the serious political implications of making no attempt tonegotiate and letting the present state of uncertainty drag on.4. Commonwealth Ministers may in general accept the political case for ourjoining the Six, although Canada will have reservations and Australia (or at least the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies) may see possible countervailing damage to thepolitical cohesion of the Commonwealth.(b) To discuss what are the Commonwealth&apos;s essential interests which we should try to safeguard5. The second purpose of the visits will be to seek the Commonwealthsviews on what their essential interests are and to discuss the special arrangements which would be needed to safeguard them.6. Some Commonwealth Ministers (New Zealand and perhaps Canada) mayargue that nothing less than the maintenance of unrestricted Commonwealth free entry into the United Kingdom for all commodities on a permanent basis willavoid damage to their economies, and that any special arrangements which limit their present right to free entry would, by definition be damaging and thereforeunacceptable.7. Ministers would explain that we would be prepared,; in an otherwisesatisfactory settlement, to accept the basic principles and objectives of the Treatyof Rome as set out in Articles 2 and 3. Ministers would say that acceptance ofthese basic principles could not be reconciled with the maintenance of the principleof Commonwealth free entry in full and for all time. We should certainly do our best to maintain as much as we can. In the case of manufactured goods we do notthink our chances are high. In the case of the developed Commonwealth countrieswe should try, if this would be helpful, to secure reductions in the level of thecommon tariff on some items. In the case of the underdeveloped commonwealth countries we should also try to secure more equitable treatment for-stheif products.Raw materials should not cause undue difficulty. As regards, temperate-foodstuffswe would seek to make special arrangements (not only for the transitional period,but for the common market period as well) which would safeguard the substance of the Commonwealth^ present position. Our aim would be to secure for commonwealth Countries outlets for their essential products&apos; in the Comthunityas a whole (i.e., including the United Kingdom) which would be broadly corhparablewith the outlets which they have now.  In the case of tropibal products from- the
newly independent Commonwealth (and the Colonies), we should hope to negotiatearrangements similar or equivalent to those made by the Six for the benefit of their&quot; associated overseas territories &quot;..8. Ministers would say that we should expect the Six to show unstanding of the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the rest of theCommonwealth, and to recognise the importance of the Commonwealth to thefree world, but we cannot expect them to let us have everything we should like.Whatever our opening position may be, we should have to be prepared in thecourse of negotiations to concentrate on securing special arrangements for thoseitems which are really essential to Commonwealth interests, because the more widely we claimed exceptional treatment, the more difficult the negotiations wouldbecome.9. United Kingdom Ministers&apos; purpose would be to explore, in the light ofthe considerations above, what are the essential interests of commonwealth countries which they would wish us to try to safeguard in any negotiations.General10. Ministers would emphasise that, at this stage, commonwealth governments are not being asked to agree to our joining the Six. They would say that they recognised that Commonwealth Governments could not commit themselves to this until they knew the terms and conditions on which we mightjoin the Community, and in particular the details of the special arrangements thatit might be possible to secure in order to safeguard Commonwealth interests.These terms and conditions could not be clear until negotiations with the Six hadtaken place. It would therefore be the aim of United Kingdom Ministers to securethe acquiescence of the Commonwealth to our entering into negotiations with the six in order to ascertain on what terms and conditions we might become fullmembers of the Community.Further Consultation with the Commonwealth11. If the United Kingdom Government open negotiations, we shall need toprepare as will the Six themselves a comprehensive negotiating brief. UnitedKingdom Ministers would say that, in that event, we would like to discuss withparticular Commonwealth Governments those parts of the brief which are of specialconcern to them (notably Australia, New Zealand and Canada). Ministers would suggest to these Governments that (always supposing such a decision had beentaken) a very small number of senior officials might meet in London for this purposeat a date to be arranged later..12. United Kingdom Ministers would also raise the question of setting up some special machinery for maintaining close and continuous consultation duringthe course of any negotiations which may take place.   It seems desirable to
supplement the normal machinery (which will, of course, be fully used) and theCommonwealth Governments with substantial interests at stake might like toconsider having small teams conveniently situated for the negotiations with the function of maintaining day to day contact with the United Kingdom negotiatingteam. For other Commonwealth Governments the normal machinery should prove adequate. During this period United Kingdom Ministers would keep intouch with Commonwealth Departmental Ministers and it may be desirable toarrange Ministerial discussion of specific points arising out of the negotiations.13. At the end of any negotiations, when we have a clear idea of the termson which membership of the European Economic Community is open to us, theUnited Kingdom Government will have to reach a final decision looking at the&quot; package &quot; as a whole on whether or not the terms are such as to justify ourjoining the Six. The Commonwealth will be fully in the picture and it may wellbe that at that point a full Commonwealth conference will be desirable.14. United Kingdom Ministers may be pressed to have a commonwealth conference before that indeed to call one in the immediate future. If they are,they would say that such a conference would have little value until there is aconcrete proposition to be discussed (which there will not be until negotiations withthe Six have gone some way), but they might undertake to find out the wishes ofthe other Commonwealth countries. In general United Kingdom Ministers woulddiscourage any such suggestion as far as they can.Publicity15. United Kingdom Ministers (and Commonwealth Ministers) will have togive some account of the talks to the Press. United Kingdom officials are preparing a draft communique for this purpose. But the whole question of publicity alreadydifficult enough will be made much more difficult if commonwealth governments volunteer independent statements on their own responsibility.United Kingdom Ministers would therefore stress the importance of the closestprior consultation before any statements are made in order to avoid weakening the negotiating position.Summary of Aims16.  United Kingdom Ministers&apos; aims can be summarised as follows:(a) To bring Commonwealth Governments to accept the broad political (andeconomic) case for our joining the Six.(b) To find out from Commonwealth Governments what are the essential interests which they would wish us to try to safeguard.(c) To secure their acquiescence in our entering into negotiations with the Sixin order to ascertain on what terms we might become full membersof the Community.
(d) To encourage the Commonwealth to make the arrangements necessary forthe closest possible consultation in the period ahead.(e) To avoid a Commonwealth conference until we have had negotiations withthe Six and have formed a clear idea of the terms on which membership of the Community would be open to us, and before we take our finaldecision.21st June, 1961.
