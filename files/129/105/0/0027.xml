Printed for the Cabinet. June 1961C. (61) n Copy No.   639th June, 1961CABINETKUWAIT: FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Lord Privy seal at the meeting of the Cabinet on 13th April (C.C. (61) 20th Conclusions,Minute 4) it was agreed that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should informthe Ruler of Kuwait that Her Majesty&apos;s Government accepted his wish to replace the Exclusive Agreement of .1899 by a new agreement, and should offer him a choice of the two types of Exchange of Notes described in paragraph 5 (a) and (b) of my memorandum of 6th April (C. (61) 49). The Political Agent has now reported thathe has reached agreement with the Ruler on a draft (the text of the proposed exchange of Notes is annexed).2. The Ruler showed a preference for the second type of Exchange of Notes,i.e., one which would both abrogate the 1899 Agreement and state that its abrogationdid not affect our continuing obligation to assist in maintaining the independence of Kuwait. The exact wording of this statement, however, caused some difficulty.We proposed to the Ruler a clause:&quot; Nothing in these conclusions shall affect Her Majesty&apos;s Government^obligation to assist the Ruler of Kuwait in the maintenance of the independence of Kuwait.&quot;There was prolonged discussion about this wording. In the end the crucial definitionin clause (d) of the Annex was arrived at:&quot; Nothing in these conclusions shall affect the readiness of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to assist the Government of Kuwait if the latter request such assistance.&quot;3. The Ruler himself accepted the notion of continuity in our obligationsbut in reaching the definition now proposed he was thinking above all of its presentation in the eyes of the other Arab States. I consider that we should respecthis judgment in the matter of presentation, particularly as our own concern, like that of the Ruler, is largely to avoid destructive criticism from the Arab nationalists.The notion of continuity is to some extent implied in the word &quot; affect &quot; as well asin clause (b). The crucial clause is less specific than is customary in instrumentsconstituting a defence commitment, but it has proved impossible to secure Kuwaitiagreement in present circumstances to anything more precise.4. The Ruler has been careful to carry with him the Supreme Council (the ruling Family in council), and this provides a useful insurance against changes which might otherwise be proposed after his reign.5. The Ruler has not shown any particular interest in the suggestion of a treatyof friendship and commerce (Recommendation (d) of my memorandum of6th April (C. (61) 49)); but this need not delay the conclusion of the Exchange of notes.59136
6. The draft Exchange of Notes as now agreed achieves our purpose. Itremoves any remaining doubt about the full independence of Kuwait, by abolishing the restrictions imposed on her by the 1899 Agreement; it makes clear that her majesty&apos;s Government are ready to defend Kuwait if necessary; and it records the close friendship which will continue between the two countries.7. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that the Political Resident maybe instructed to exchange Notes with the Ruler in this form. The text would thenbe made public almost immediately.E. H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,8th June, 1961.SECRET&apos;
