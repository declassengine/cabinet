Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1961C. (61) 51 Copy No. g 512th April, 1961CABINETMEMORIALS TO VICTORIES IN THE SECOND WORLD war memorandum by the Minister of defence on 15th September, 1960, the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with theService Ministers and the Minister of Works, to consider, in the context of theproposal by the Secretary of State for Air that there should be a memorial tothe Battle of Britain, the general desirability of erecting public memorialscommemorating victories in the Second World War (C.C. (60) 50th Conclusions,Minute 1).   I have also consulted the Home Secretary.2. No national memorials to victory have been erected in this century. Itis known that some Local Authorities have named streets after battles orcampaigns of the last War, and one village in Hampshire was re-named Enham-Alamein. It is also the custom of the Services to commemorate memorableactions in the names of barracks, camps and other Service installations. Neitherthe Royal Navy nor the Army wants to do more than this.3. I have no knowledge of any, public discussion of the desirability ofmemorials to victory. In 1945 the House of Lords debated the form whichmemorials to the dead should take (House of Lords Official Report:14th February, 1945: Col. 1011). No suggestion was made in the course of the debate that there should be memorials to victory as well. I know of no reasonfor supposing that public opinion was different at the time, or that it has changedin the intervening 15 years. One would suppose that there would be even lessinterest now.(4.  I conclude that it is doubtful whether there would be much, if any, support,either for a single memorial to victory in the Second World War, or for a series-of. memorials to particular victories.5. It does not, however, follow that there would be little or no support forthe proposal to commemorate the Battle of Britain which is in many ways aspecial case. Its memory has been kept green; it is still regarded by the general public, as the Secretary of State for Air has said, as a major victory and deliverance;it was manifestly a battle against heavy odds; and it has not given rise to thediscussion and controversy which have clouded other great feats of arms.Moreover, Press comment in 1959 was favourable to the idea of commemoratingthe Battle of Britain.6. It may well be that the Battle of Britain occupies a special place in the minds of people because it was so near to us and because we were all in it in thefront line the wardens, the Fire Service, the aircraft workers and the civilpopulation at large as well as the fighting Services. If the Battle is to becommemorated I feel that it would be right for the memorial to be dedicated, notonly to the Royal Air Force, but also to all who helped to make the victorypossible. -58832THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
7. I agree with the, Secretary of State for Air that the form which   a memorialshould take should be remitted to a small committee of public names. But theestablishment of such a committee would commit us to the project. As a first step I suggest that we should do what we can to test public opinion, e.g., by consultation with political parties ori&apos;b&apos;6&apos;rh sid s; the&apos;-British&apos; Legion and perhaps byinitiating correspondence in The Times.8. I would also propose that if, after testing opinion, we decide to go ahead,the committee appointed to consider the form which a memorial should take shouldalso, be asked fo consider the question of a public appeal for funds. ]S p rfenCehas shown that this is necessary to arouse and crystallise public interest, eventhough the Government would have to underwrite the project.     1 &apos; &apos;&quot;&quot; &quot;&apos;9. If it is decided that a memorial should be erected, we ought not, I suggest,to think primarily in terms of a traditional monument or mural. A memorialwould most fittingly commemorate what was essentially a battle of young men ifit were of direct benefit to young people. &apos; &quot;&apos;10. A scholarship fund on the lines of the Kitchener Services scholarshipssprings to mind, but, like other forms of direct financial benefit, this wouldprobably not be of great value in these days.11. One imaginative suggestion which has been put forward is that the memorial should take the form of an additional hall of residence at one of thenew Universities, over and above what would normally be provided. If, as seems likely, there is to be a University of Kent it would be particularly appropriate toestablish the memorial there. &apos; &quot;&apos; -12. I am greatly attracted by this idea, which I believe would receive widesupport.  I commend it to my colleagues.13.  I conclude that:(a) There is no evidence of any general demand for a public memorial ormemorials to victories gained in the Second World War, but there mightwell be public support for a memorial to the Battle of Britain.(b) If the Battle of Britain is to be commemorated it&apos;should be by way of a memorial commemorating the effort of all those who took part, civiliansas well as Servicemen.(c) A memorial might fittingly take the form of an additional hall of residenceor other suitable building at the proposed University of Kent if it is established.(d) The Secretary of State for Air should test public opinion and report again to the Cabinet before a public announcement is made and a committeeof public names appointed.(e) The committee should consider the form of a memorial, including thesuggestion at (c) above, and should be asked to consider&apos; also thequestion of a public appeal for funds.H. W.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,11th April, 1961.
