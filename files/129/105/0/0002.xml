Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1961C. (61) 52 Copy No.  5 312th April, 1961CABINETRAILWAY WORKING WEEKMemorandum by the Paymaster GeneralThe British Transport Commission are now faced with claims from the railway unions for a reduction in the working week:Railway Conciliation Grades from 44 hours to 40 hours;Railway Salaries Staff from 42 hours to 38 hours;Railway Shopmen from 44 hours to 40 hours;i.e., a reduction of 4 hours per week all round.2. The Railways are now almost the only major industry with a 44-hour week most are working on 42 hours&quot; and the Commission, believing that areduction of 2 hours is inevitable, wish to negotiate such a reduction and to givea reply to the Unions early next week.3. They are of the opinion that they could arrange for a 2-hour reduction on more favourable terms than if they try to let the matter go to arbitration.4. Under present conditions the cost in a full year would be  17 millions;the cost in the current year would depend On the date of the reduction in hours.5. The Wages Committee considered the matter on 11th April and came tothe following conclusions:(a) that a 42-hour week (staff 40 hours) was inevitable;(b) that a negotiated settlement should give the best results;(c) the Transport Commission should inform the Unions that they were willingto concede the principle of a reduction of not more than two hoursper week, subject to the settlement of satisfactory rosters for all the grades concerned and to this end there should be co-operation in theuse of work studies to settle the most advantageous working in theinterests of all concerned.6. In carrying out these arrangements 1st January next should be the aim forthe start in the reduction of hours but an earlier date might have to be fixed if circumstances allow.7. The Cabinet should be aware that a settlement of this matter, while itmay delay a wage claim, would most probably be followed by such a claim; butthe Committee considered that that should be considered on its merits when itarose.M.Office of the Paymaster General, S.W. 1,12th April, 1961.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT58842
