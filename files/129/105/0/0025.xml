Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1961C (61) 75 Copy No.   549th June, 1961CABINETRESTRICTIVE LABOUR PRACTICESMemorandum by the Minister of labour at the meeting of the Cabinet on 18th May I was asked to give furtherconsideration to means of inquiring into restrictive practices in the labour field(C.C. (61) 28th Conclusions, Minute 4).Collective Bargaining2, Collective bargaining between employers and trade unions extends over thewhole range of working conditions, including such matters as hours of work,overtime, manning scales, demarcation of work and apprenticeship. To this extent it may said that some elements of restriction enter into most negotiated agreements.But provided they are kept within reason, and the great majority are, these donot amount restrictive practices in the usual sense of the term. Many can be defended as necessary to the safety or welfare of workers, or to maintain standards of efficiency. We should be most unwise to disturb the normal processes of collective bargaining by interfering with the general run of agreements of this sort.Restricted Labour Practices3. Our problem is the unreasonable extension of restriction to the point where it is in conflict with the needs of efficient production and with the publicinterest.   Examples are:(a) Demarcation rules which impede production and lead to frequentinter-union disputes. -(b) Manning scales which lead to wasteful operation of plant and equipment,and hinder or prevent the introduction of new machinery and new methods of working.(c) Restrictions on the entry of apprentices which prevent the creation of anadequate skilled labour force.(d) Restriction of output by the imposition of limits on earnings.(e) Refusal to allow work and method study.Recent Action against Restrictive Practices4.  The action taken in recent years includes the following:(a) An inquiry by my National Joint Advisory Council into &quot;practicesimpeding the full and efficient use of manpower &quot;. A Report was published in 1959. The Council listed the industries in which suchpractices prevailed and urged them to &quot; make yet further efforts toget to grips with their problems &quot;.59143
(b) The appointment, of the Royal Commission on the Newspaper andMagazine Industry. It was made clear in the House of Commons thatrestrictive practices would be relevant:to the inquiry.id) The appointment of the Rochdale Committee of Inquiry into Docks and harbours. The Committee are asked to consider, amongst other things, &quot; whether, the methods of working can be improved&quot;&quot;.id) The Report of; the Sub-Committee on Prospects of the ShipbuildingP(* Advisory Committee, published in April, recommended considerationof labour relations and the use of labour in the industry.ie) Discussion of industrial relations in the motor industry. The introductionof work study and inter-union problems were discussed at my talks with leading employers and trade unionists, and were included in the agreed joint statement.A Labour Practices commission. It has been suggested that restrictive labour practices should be subjectto independent inquiry by a permanent body similar to the monopolies commission. A Labour Practices Commission of this kind would apply the test of public interest. They would have to assess how far any practice is wastefuland inefficient; consider how far it is, nevertheless, justified by safety or other reasons; and take account of its significance in any general agreement between employers and unions and of the effect of any change on relations. Against this background they would have to decide whether or not the practice is against thepublic interest.6. The suggestion is attractive but there are formidable practical objections.Legislation would be needed, especially because some employers and some unionsmight be reluctant to give evidence unless legally compelled. It would be necessaryto define the kinds of practice to be examined. The Commission would in practice be driven to examine restrictive practices in the context of a mass of inter-relaiedterms and conditions of employment agreed in the course of collective bargaining.The Commission would inevitably work in an atmosphere of suspicion andhostility, for the unions would regard a permanent body with powers of inquiry into results of collective bargaining as threatening their powers to negotiate.Some employers would dislike the proposal because of the risk that inquirieswould damage relations between them and their workers. As most restrictive practices are agreed with or accepted by employers the Commission could notrely on the interested parties to bring cases before them. If complaints fromother parties were allowed there would be wide scope for busybodies. TheGovernment would be pressed, both in Parliament and by the public, to enforce the Commission^ findings. We could scarcely proceed effectively by law againstlarge numbers of workpeople determined to operate particular practices and theresult of legal action could be to drive the practices underground.Alternative Action7. The alternative is to approach the problem more selectively, industry by industry. Most restrictive practices have their origin in the particular circumstancesof a particular industry, and can most effectively be examined by, or in co-operationwith, those who are fully aware of the practical problems of the industry and carry responsibility for deciding future policy, not only in relation to working conditions, but also as regards investment and production. The inquiries intothe newspaper and magazine, docks and shipbuilding industries are consistent withthis approach.8. If this line were followed, the next step would be for me to arrange for my National Joint Advisory Council to consider the subject again. The earlier discussions gave a useful lead, though there was little immediate positive action.I believe that the present climate of opinion in the Council would make them moreready to get down to practical detail. There has been an encouraging increase ofdetermination to achieve results from the current broad programme of studyingproblems of industrial relations. I would aim to lead the Council to identifyproblems in particular industries and to recommend the negotiating bodies concerned to review them and take action.  I would follow up these recommendations, and secret.,&quot;&apos;: :;;v,
arrange talks with industries which seemed unlikely to take action if this was leftto their initiative. Where it seemed likely that a negotiating body would not make progress I would consider appointing an ad hoc independent committee to investigate and report to me. I could do this under my general powers and legislation would not be needed.9. I consider that on balance the course of action outlined in paragraphs and 8 offers the best prospect of effective progress and I invite my colleagues&apos;approval of it.J.H.Ministry of Labour, S.W. 1,8th June, 1961.
