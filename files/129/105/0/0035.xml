Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1961C. (61) 85 Copy No.   5 526th June, 1961CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT IN GREATER london memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh AffairsThe Royal Commission on Greater London reported (Cmnd. 1164) in October(Greater London includes for this purpose the whole of the counties of Londonand Middlesex, parts of Essex, Kent and Surrey and a very small part ofHerts. It contains a population of over 8  millions. Maps are attached to theRoyal Commission^ Report.). Since then I have collected the views of all the localauthorities affected, and there have been inter-departmental discussions to see howfar Departments are agreed on the main recommendations. I now seek the viewsof the Cabinet on the principal issues involved. I would like to publish a white paper setting out the Government^ conclusions and intentions as soon as may be.The Commission^ recommendations. The Commission, whose report was unanimous, found that &quot; judged bythe twin tests of administrative efficiency and the health of representative government, the present structure of local government in [Greater London] is inadequate and needs overhaul &quot; (paragraph 696 of the Report).3. They had two main criticisms of the present system. One was that &quot; anumber of the vital functions of local government within the area require a broader treatment than can be given to them under the present system&quot;. these functions include town planning, traffic, roads and overspill, all of which need intheir view to be dealt with on a Greater London basis, but which are at presentthe concern of many different authorities.4. Their second main criticism was the lack of scope which the present structure provides for the boroughs in the area. Some of these are among thelargest in the country, but instead of being allowed to run their own affairs ascounty boroughs do, they play a subsidiary role in uneasy partnership with thecounty councils. Within the county of London the concentration of power in thehands of the London County Council leaves the metropolitan boroughs withfunctions more limited than those of the smallest urban district council.5. The Commission proposed that the whole area should be divided into52 boroughs, including the City as a borough, (in place of 95 existing boroughs and urban districts), and that these boroughs should be the primary units of localgovernment. They should perform all functions, except those which can onlybe effectively performed over the wider area of Greater London. Functions which require the wider treatment should be performed by a directly elected greater london Council.6. Some functions would, they thought, have to be exercised concurrently,but the broad division of main functions which they envisaged was that the boroughs would be responsible for housing: personal health, welfare andchildren&apos;s services: environmental health: roads (other than main roads): libraries.59200THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
They recommended that the Greater London Council should be the education and planning authority, with provision for some distribution of these functions between themselves and the boroughs; and also should be responsible for traffic,main roads, refuse disposal and the fire and ambulance services. Police and waterwere outside the Commissions terms of reference.Reactions7. The comments I have received show that almost every local authorityagrees that things cannot be left as they are. About as many are prepared toaccept the Commissions type of solution as oppose it. In London and Middlesexthe opinion in the boroughs divides almost entirely on party lines, nearly everyConservative-controlled council being in favour, and most Labour-controlledcouncils being opposed. In the outer counties opinion is also divided, but notnoticeably on party lines.8. Inter-departmental discussions show a general agreement that localgovernment within Greater London needs radical reorganisation, and that the broad line proposed by the Commission is the right one. All are agreed in wantingstronger boroughs which can become the primary units of local government. MyDepartment and the Ministry of Transport both want an authority which canexercise highway, traffic and the major planning functions over the whole of thebuilt-up area.9. All Departments with a major concern in local government want, however,to see fewer and larger boroughs than the Commission proposed the Ministryof Education much fewer and much larger. This is the most difficult point in thewhole business, and I return to it below.The Main Issue10. I think we will probably all agree with the Commissions main conclusionthat local government within the Greater London area needs to be radicallyreorganised. Their two main criticisms as set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 above arebeyond dispute. The plain fact is that London has completely outgrown its systemof local government. What we have to do now is to match it to the needs of a cityvastly bigger than that for which it was devised, and a city facing problems,especially of traffic and of strangulation, undreamed of at the end of the last century when the present structure was devised.11. I expect we will also agree that the Commissions broad approach to thesolution is the right one, though there is undoubtedly a very difficult point on the size of the boroughs. No satisfactory alternative to the Commissions plan hasbeen suggested. The counties threatened with extinction or amputation nowexpress their willingness to set up a joint board to co-ordinate and plan (though notto execute) some &quot; Greater London &quot; functions, and to give the boroughs more todo by delegation or conferment. I am certain this is no remedy for the ills ofLondon government. The body charged with the general planning of land use,roads, traffic and the like, must have real and independent authority if it is to be effective. Nor would the joint body solution satisfy the reasonable aspirations ofthe boroughs. Unless we adopt a solution on the lines recommended by theCommission, some of the larger of these boroughs will certainly seek countyborough status from Parliament, and will deserve it.12. The Commission^ concept of the borough as the primary unit, andparticularly as the authority administering a whole range of personal services, is Iam convinced the right one, and it is widely supported in our Party. A system which places housing, preventive and environmental health services, welfare andchildren&apos;s services in the hands of one authority, local enough in character to enablelocal knowledge of the area and of its living and working conditions to be broughtto bear, will not only greatly enlarge the scope of the borough councillor, but willalso make for more effective administration of these closely linked social services.This seems to me to be the key feature of the Commissions plan, and one welldesigned to further the broad purpose to which our efforts at local government reorganisation are directed to attract into local government more men and women of real ability by making sure that there are worthwhile jobs for them to do.
13. I believe we now have an opportunity to put through a really effectivepiece of reorganisation which will bring London government into harmony withthe physical features of the metropolis, and will fit it to face the challenge presented by changing social conditions and the ubiquitous motor car. The need for changesis widely accepted, there is a remarkably good measure of support in localgovernment itself for a radical solution, and we have the benefit of a unanimousreport which has earned widespread praise. We should not be deterred by the magnitude of the operation and the upheaval which it will cause. If the diagnosis1is right, as I think it is, then major surgery is necessary. The Commission were satisfied that the operation was feasible. They were also satisfied that Essex, Kentand Surrey would remain viable counties after the severance of their metropolitanareas. They are plainly right on both points. If we were not to adopt theCommission^ broad plan, we would need to explain why we found it unacceptable,and what we proposed to do instead to meet the evident need for machinery fortackling problems common to Greater London, and for increasing the responsibilityentrusted to the Greater London boroughs.Education14. The Commission^ proposals provide for a sharing of the administrationof the education service between the Council for Greater London and the boroughs.The cost would be borne by the Council and charged on the whole area. their proposals under this head have been widely criticised, and this two-tier system isnot acceptable to the Ministry of Education. They consider that the borough shouldbe the education authority, except in a central area with a population of some,100,000 where there should be unified control perhaps through a joint board.Elsewhere they consider that it would be necessary to have very large boroughs,preferably some 17 with a population averaging 430,000, and certainly not morethan 23 with a population averaging 320,000. Their reasons for this are theimportance they attach to a wide choice of schools, and the difficulties they foreseein filling the top posts in 50 or so boroughs, and in getting co-ordinated planningamong them.The Size of the Boroughs15. The Commission^ provisional proposals for the constitution of boroughsprovides for 51 (plus the City of London) with an average population of 165,000and a population range of 81,000 to 249,000. As explained above, all Departmentsfeel that at the lower end these boroughs would be inconveniently small. Formyself I believe that a borough of 100,000 can function efficiently, but I am preparedto accept that we should aim at reducing the number to about 40 with a populationminimum around 200,000 (excluding the City of London, which we must leave asit is). In my view this would unquestionably make for authorities of sufficient size and resources to attract staff of the right quality, and would well fit the concept ofthe borough as the primary unit.16. To go even this far will, however, increase our difficulties. the boroughs will resist amalgamations, and the larger the amalgamations the greater the resistance.17. If we proposed boroughs over 300,000, not a single borough wouldsurvive in its present form. Under the Commission^ proposals 19 would surviveintact (including 3 county boroughs, which would lose some powers). once we have decided and announced our general line, we shall have to draw up a provisional plan for the new boroughs for discussion with the authorities. I am not persuaded that the pattern provisionally proposed by the Commission wasnecessarily right quite apart from the question of size. They kept very closely to existing boundaries, simply proposing amalgamations, and I think it may wellbe right to alter these boundaries at points. But however that, may be, if we propose very large boroughs, such as the Ministry of Education desires, we shall certainly run into serious trouble.18. I am quite sure myself that very large boroughs (by which I meanboroughs of over   million population) are not the best units of local government.They inevitably tend to become bureaucratic and the larger they are, the more remote the councillor.   There would too be great difficulty in arguing that the
circumstances of Greater London were so different that it was necessary to havehere boroughs far larger than county boroughs elsewhere. Outside Greater Londonwe are accepting 100,000 as the population which qualifies a district forconsideration as a county borough. The average size of the five county boroughsinto which the Local Government Commission propose that the Black country should be reconstituted is about 190,000. Of the 83 existing county boroughsin England and Wales, only 14 have populations over 250,000, only 6 over 320,000.19. Indeed I do not know how we would present the argument for a patternbased on relatively few and very large boroughs. We could not possibly say thatthis was best for local government. It would be obvious to all the authorities, andto a good many other people too, that the pattern had simply been devised to suitthe education service, regardless of the broader issue of what produces the best kindof local government unit.20. I recognise that a pattern which provided for as many as 40 boroughswithin the area of Greater London would present the Minister of Education witha difficult problem. But I do not believe that problem is insuperable. It does not seem to me impossible to insist on some measure of freedom of choice for pupilsbetween neighbouring authorities or indeed throughout the area, even if there are40 education authorities. Nor can I believe that it is impossible to find sufficientgood education officers for this number of authorities out of the whole greateducational profession, or to devise means of planning the proper provision of theservice over the whole of the area. Meanwhile it seems to me that the overriding consideration, for education as well as for the other local government services, isa healthy system of local government; and I am convinced that we shall achievethat better by going for boroughs of moderate size than for very large ones.Conclusions21. (a) I ask the Cabinet to agree that we should propose the reorganisation of local government within Greater London on the broad lines recommended bythe Royal Commission, making the borough the primary unit, but creating aGreater London Council (directly elected) to carry out certain functions.(b) If this is agreed, I need a decision on the size of the boroughs. my proposal is that we should aim at organising the whole area into about 40 boroughs,with a minimum population of about 200,000; the precise pattern must dependon how it works out on the ground, and on the reactions we get to detailed proposalswhen we publish them.(c) If both (a) and (b) are agreed, I suggest that I should now prepare, inconsultation with those of my colleagues principally concerned, a draft White paper for the consideration of the Cabinet. There are several other points both of substance and of procedure which the Cabinet will wish to consider, but this can probably best be done in the context of a Paper.Time-table22. It will not be practicable to legislate next session; but for the removal of uncertainty it is important that the White Paper should be published before the recess. The local authorities badly need to know what, if anything, the government intend to do. It is exceedingly difficult for them to carry on in the present state of doubt. We should in my view aim to produce a Bill at the beginning of the 1962-63session. If we did that the new authorities might be elected in the autumn of 1964and take over from the existing authorities in April 1965.H.
