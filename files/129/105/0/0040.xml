Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1961C. (61) 90 Copy No.30th June, 1961CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT IN GREATER london memorandum by the Minister of education the pattern of local government in London recommended by the RoyalCommission involves a two-tier system for the education service, with manyfunctions divided between the Greater London Council and the boroughs.2. I am against a two-tier system for education. While the Commissionthemselves strongly, and quite rightly, criticise the way this system works in outerLondon, especially in Middlesex, they fail to see that their own scheme amounts toapplying the same system to the whole of Greater London. This would causeconstant friction and widespread inefficiency.3. Experience has shown that the best unit is a local education authorityresponsible for the planning and administration of all schools and technical collegesother than Colleges of Advanced Technology in its area. What sort of area issuitable depends on the local situation. Outside London a moderate-sized countyborough is all right because it is usually a self-contained town whose schools mustin any case be planned with no more than marginal concern for the surrounding area and which, as the geographical centre for a larger area., is the natural provider ofa wide range of further education facilities. In. London, by contrast, any boroughis bound to be a more or less arbitrary slice of a vast built-up area, and therefore isnot by its nature self-contained for education purposes.4. Such a slice has to have a boundary and wherever this is drawn it is sureto get in -the way of some people&apos;s reasonable wish to send their children to schoolon the other side. It is a good thing, therefore, other things being equal, to have asfew boundaries as possible and this becomes more and more desirable towards thecentre of London. Here there is not only a highly developed transport system which enables children to go to school all over inner London wherever they live, and students to come in for further education courses of all kinds from the suburbs, butalso a tradition of free movement of children and students which depends on asingle local administration.5. Thus the first need of the education service is for a single local educationauthority for central London. Outside this central area most boundaries are just as arbitrary and parents are just as keen to have a good choice of schools withinthe limits imposed by travelling. This implies authorities of substantial size though they need not be as large as in the centre.6. A further reason to go for as few education authorities as possible is thedifficulty of finding really good staff to plan and administer the service whichbecomes more exacting as it expands. Already enough competent and enterprisingchief education officers, architects and other staff are not available, as we know from the experience of excepted districts. Every new local education authority wecreate makes this problem worse.7. In short I am concerned that there should be viable local educationauthorities in the centre a single authority which I should prefer to have a population of     2 millions but which must have at least 1,100,000 as a bare59217
minimum; further out separate authorities for areas within the range of320,000-430,000 mentioned in paragraph 14 of C. (61) 85. I do not attempt to judge whether there should be 52 or 40 or any other number of boroughs in greater london; what I do maintain is that if they are too small or too numerous in anypart of Greater London to provide an education service as good as the present,arrangements should be made to combine them in joint boards for educationpurposes. Such boards would be composed of members nominated by eachborough council, would draw their funds by precept on the boroughs, and wouldemploy their own staff and exercise the full functions of local education authorities.I am quite sure the parents would welcome the wider choice of schools such a system would preserve.8. Subject to this I am happy to leave the decision on borough areas to theMinister of Housing and Local Government.D. E.Ministry of Education, W. 1,30th June, 1961.
