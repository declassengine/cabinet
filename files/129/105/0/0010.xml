IMPORTS OF UNITED STATES coal memorandum by the Minister of power the Steel Co mpany of Wales have applied for a licence to import 250, 000 tons of coking coal from the United States.   This applicationappeared to raise important issues of policy, and my officials are nowdiscussing them with officials in other Departments.    In view of theinterest caused by Press reports on 8th May, I am sure the Cabinet will want to be informed of the main issues.2. No imports of coal into this country are now allowed from out-side the sterling area.    Imports from the sterling area are negligible.Lake other coal producers, we at present claim exemption for coal underthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade from its  general proscriptionof quantity restrictions.3. The Steel Company of Wales consider that imports of Americancoal would secure a substantial saving.   The Company are also doubtful if enough coking coals will be produced at home to meet their demands and those of other users.4. The Iron and Steel Board and.the National Coal Board were consulted about the Company&apos;s application.   The Iron and Steel Boardthink that steel producers near large ports, using 12 million tons ofcoking coal a year, could at present profitably switch to American imports and save  11 millions a year.   The Board however think steel producersv/ould be unwilling to rely too heavily on imported coal and this mightrestrict the switch to 2 million tons, with a saving of  3 millions.   TheBoard think that the use of American coal would in some cases save asmuch as 50s. Od. a ton, but d coal costs to twelve major works the saving ranges from about 2s. 6d. to 22s. Od. a ton.   British steelexports will be competing with those from European coastal plants,which will otherwise have the advantage of cheaper and better Americancoal.   This is of exceptionally high quality and the Board feels thatsteel firms should have free access to the cheapest and best availableraw materials, including American coal, though they appreciate that in reaching their decision the Government must take into account other considerations which are outside the Board&apos;s competence.5. The National Coal Board agree that American coal at presenthas the edge on British coal in the neighbourhood of large ports, butclaim that British coking coal is still the cheapest in Europe and that a risein freight rates might wipe out the present advantage of importing.    Ifimports were allowed, the Coal Board would ask to be relieved of their statutory obligation, which they have up to now interpreted as requiringthem to develop and maintain sufficient capacity to meet homeneeds as far-1-CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT)C.

as possible from home coal.   The Board would also want freedom to adjust their prices to meet competition of American coals near the ports and to offset their reduced prices in these areas by making fullincreases elsewhere.   The Board point to the need for confidence in the.industry&apos;s future, which would be jeopardised by acceptance of imports.Finally, they have given an assurance that they will be able to meetthe full requirements of the Steel Company of Wales for coking coal.6. It would be impossible to restrict the concession to the SteelCompany of Wales or even to the steel industry.   If we imported Americancoal we would almost certainly have to be prepared to import some from europe.   Imported coal would probably be cheaper today south of a line from the Wash to the Severn, where 40 million tons of coal are burnteach year, and in other parts of Great Britain and Northern Irelandaway from coalfields.   The amount of coal annually at stake might be25 million tons, worth over  100 millions.   A reduction of coal outputon anything like this scale would have major social and political consequences.   The necessary closing of pits, the dissipation of miningskills and the blow to the industry&apos;s morale caused by any substantialimports would involve the risk of a serious coal shortage in the future.7. Although it seems clear that the Company would at presentsave money if their application were accepted, the difficulty of limiting the permission to import and the consequences to the Coal Board of any considerable extension of it, raise issues of great importance.   these will require consideration against the background of the proposals of theChairman of the National Coal Board for the future of the coal industry,which I am hoping to receive later in the summer, and possibly alsoin the light of further developments in connection with the Treaty of Rome.The implications are of such far-reaching importance that I think theysho old be thoroughly sutdied by officials before we take any final decisions.     In the meantime, I hope the Cabinet will agree that,until v/e have received a report from officials, we should maintain our refusal of this application.11. F. W.Ministry of Power, S. W. 1.9th May, 1961-2-
