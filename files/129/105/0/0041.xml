SECRET -       I fj u(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT;C. (61) 91 COPY NO.  S%4th July, 1961CABINETNUCLEAR PROPULSION FOR MERCHANT shipd memorandum by the Paymaster-general on 17th December, 1959, the Cabinet decided that, without commit -ment, the Governmentshould call for tenders from selected British firmsfor a nuclear propulsion unit suitable for installation in a merchant shipjand that the Atomic Energy Authority should continue studies of alternativetypes of atomic propulsion units (C. C. (59) 64th Conclusions, Minute 5).2.      Five British firms were asked to tender for a complete marine;nuclear propulsion unit and tenders were received in July, 1960.   Thesetenders have been examined by an expert committee which have also con-sidered reports by the Atomic Energy Authority on their independent studies.It emerges that it would be technically feasible to build a nuclear poweredship now, but that with existing techniques such a ship could not be developed to operate as economically as ships powered by conventional means.3.   The results of these investigations were considered on 26th June, 1961by a sub- committee of the Economic Policy Committee under my chairmanship.   The sub-committee concluded:-(i) We should not build a nuclear ship now.   The cost of a nuclear65,000 deadweight ton tanker (which would be the right choice for a firstship) would be  13- 15 millions, including special supporting facilities and trials.   The cost of a similar conventional tanker would be about 4 millions.   Running costs would also be greater so that the return on capital invested would be much less than that of a correspondingconventional ships.(ii) Instead, a vigorous research and development programme shouldbe undertaken with the objective of producing an economic marine nuclear propulsion unit as soon as possible.   The cost might be some  25 millions over six years on a rising scale.   But it would not be necessary initiallyto commit ourselves to more than  3- 4 millions on the development of basic technologies to see whether nuclear propulsion would be likely tobe worthwhile.(iii) We should at the same time co-operate in the studies of the EuropeanNuclear Energy Agency, without commitment.   The Agency are at presentlooking at the possibility of a European research and development pro-gramme and a European nuclear ship.4.   These conclusions have the support of the First Lord of theadmiralty.,    When the matter last came before the Cabinet in December,1959, he urged that a nuclear merchant ship should be built if the tendersshowed that it would be feasible to do so.    However, having considered theevidence which has since become available he now supports the view of
of the sub-committee that our best interests would be served by embarking on a further research and development programme before committing ourselves to the construction of a nuclear ship.5.   There are strong competitive reasons for pressing ahead with the attempt to develop a nuclear merchant ship of independent British designwhich would be at least as economic as a similar conventional ship.The United States, the Soviet Union and the Federal German Republic are all active in this field, and, although there is as yet no evidence that theyhave solved the problems of producing an economic nuclear ship we cannot afford to fall behind them in the race to develop and acquire experience of operating such a ship.6.   The research and development programme for a marine nuclear propulsion unit would be carried out by the Atomic Energy Authority  inconjunction with industry, but would be distinct from the Authority&apos;sexisting research and development programme in other fields.7.     I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer considers thatthe case on economic grounds for doing anything more than we are atpresent seems doubtful, and that, in any event, this should not be considered in isolation from a review now beginning of the Authority&apos;s present prog-gramme,   The sub - committee were not competent to take a decision onthe financial aspects, but they hoped it would be possible to authorise the initial expenditure of  3- 4 millions on the marine programme withoutcutting down on the Authority&apos;s existing research programme.8.   As it is nearly a year since tenders for a marine nuclear propulsionunit were received from industry, the Minister of Transport is underpressure to announce the Governmenfs policy about nuclear merchant ships.   He therefore wishes to make an announcement, either as aprepared Parliamentary Statement or as an Answer to a parliamentary question, before the House rises for the Summer Recess.   A draft announcement is annexed to this memorandum.9.   I invited my colleagues to -(a) Endorse the policy outlined in paragraph 3 of this memorandum thata nuclear powered ship should not be built now but that a research anddevelopment programme should be undertaken at an initial cost of 3- 4 millions.   Decisions on further expenditure would be taken later inthe light of progress.(b) Consider whether it would be possible to authorise the proposedresearch and development programme for a marine nuclear propulsion unitindependently and in advance of decisions on the Atomic Energy Authority&apos;sexisting research and development programme in other fields.(c) Approve the terms of the announcement annexed to this memorandum to be made as soon as possible and in any case before the Summer Recess.M.Office of the Paymaster-General,S. W. R4th July, 1961
annex draft ANNOUNCEMENT PROPOSED BY THEMINISTER OF transport the tenders received by my Department from industry for a nuclearreactor suitable for installation in a merchant ship have been examined indetail by the Committee on the Application of Nuclear Power for MarinePurposes and by its Technical Committee, and the Government have care-fully considered the matter in the light of the advice received from theCommittee.This advice shows that while it would certainly be technicallyfeasible to build a nuclear powered ship now, nuclear propulsion for marinepurposes does not offer sufficient economic promise to justify building a ship at the present time.   The Government have therefore decided that theright course in present circumstances is to authorise a vigorous programmeof research and development aimed at producing as quickly as possible areactor system which is economically attractive to a wide range of shipping.The programme will be / drawn up and kept under review by a small working group of high calibre and will be/  carried out by the Atomic Energy authority in conjunction with industry.    / The group will report jointly to the Ministerfor Science and to me. /-3-
