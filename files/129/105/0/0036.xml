Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1961C. (61) 86 Copy No.26th June, 1961      , &quot; . . :        . &apos;CABINETSOUTHERN CAMEROONS-   Memorandum by the Lord ChancellorWhen the Cabinet discussed the situation in the Southern Cameroons on13th June (C.C. (61) 31st Conclusions, Minute 7) they agreed that the UnitedKingdom delegation to the talks to be held between Mr. Foncha and Mr. Ahidjoon 15th June should be given the following instructions:, ,.        , .(a) They should conduct their discussions on the basis that we intended towithdraw the United Kingdom battalion after 1st October,(b) They should-seek to ascertain what measures were contemplated by thePrime Minister of the Southern Cameroons, Mr. Foncha, and the PrimeMinister of the Cameroun Republic, Mr. Ahidjo, for the maintenanceof the administration and of internal security, and how. far they were agreed about future arrangements for the Southern Cameroons andits associations with the Cameroun Republic.(c) They could indicate that we would be prepared to provide  \ million in.. assistance during the first year after independence, either to enable ourexpatriate officers to continue in the administration; or.to support thebudget - r:; .The delegation have now returned and their report has been considered by theAfeiea- Committee. -2. The &quot;delegation found that there were serious differences between mr. Ahidjo, and Mr..&apos;, Foncha about the transfer of sovereignty on 1st October.Mr. Foncha insisted that transfer of sovereignty could be effected only to a federation and that it was therefore necessary to establish Federal arrangementsbefore 1st October.. Mr. Ahidjo, on the other hand, insisted that, in accordancewith the United Nations resolution of 21st April, the Southern Cameroons must first join the Cameroun Republic and that the Federation could not be set up until after it had done so. Because of this fundamental disagreement, no progress couldbe made on discussions about the possibility of a Southern Cameroon securityforce being trained by.forces of the Republic; the prospects of agreement on suchan arrangement did not-appear in any case to be great, since Mr. Ahidjo is clearlysuspicious of any suggestion that Mr. Foncha should establish, a private army.3. The delegation announced our intention of withdrawing the UnitedKingdom force from the Southern Cameroohs on 1st October. Mr. Fonchapressed stranglyjfor; Jts.iretention* -but-thougfr-Mr^Ahidjo- associated:himself with a formal request to -this effect, it was clear thatihis support was lukewarm and therehave since been,further indications that he,is not, in favour, of the proposal.  .;4.   In the event our delegation didnot put.forward the offer of &amp;\ million aid.5. The delegation further reported that neither the SouStribrh Cameroonians,nor the local British community, have so far taken literally the officialannouncements that the battalion will leaye;,on 1st October, As soon,as it became clear that it was to do so, officials, including; expatriate police officers, whosecontracts were due to expire would begin to leave and it was&apos; expected that mostexpatriate employees of British firms would follow suit.  There could thus be no59205
question of an Aid Mission and it was highly probable that the Southern CameroonsGovernment would collapse, opening the way for the establishment of a Communistregime. On the other hand, they reported that there would be grave implicationsif the battalion were to remain. It would almost certainly require reinforcementand might well become involved in the internal squabbles between two parts of thefuture Federation.6.   The delegation made four recommendations: ....(a) That military action should be taken before 1st October against one. campof 200 terrorists which has been located in an isolated area.   1 &apos; - &apos;-!(b) That a Consular post should be opened at Buea on 1st October.(c) That if the British battalion is to be withdrawn on 1st October an immediate announcement should be made so that those who wish to leave mayhave reasonable time in which to do so.(d) That an alternative to the withdrawing of the battalion might be to confineit to the Victoria district (the coastal area) for a period of 12 months.7. The Africa Committee have concluded that the first three of these recommendations should be accepted; they were advised that the risk that the limited anti-terrorist operation proposed might provoke a general outbreak of terrorism, which would require the reinforcement of our battalion, was small.They rejected the proposal to leave a battalion in the coastal area of the southern Cameroons for a further 12 months. The Chiefs of Staff have reported thatthey see serious military objections to this course and, if it were adopted, the riskof involvement in the squabbles of Mr. Foncha and Mr. Ahidjo would remain.8. The Amea Committee also concluded that we should remain preparedto offer million aid to the Southern Cameroons and that we should proceed withtransitional arrangements for the ending of Commonwealth Preferences after1st October.9. There is a possibility that Mr. Foncha, if he is unable to compose hisdifferences with Mr. Ahidjo, may appeal to the United Nations to extendtrusteeship beyond 1st October: if such an appeal were granted, our responsibility would of course remain. The suggestion has been made that it might be in our interests to encourage him to do so: on the one hand a further period in which tocomplete transitional arrangements might be instrumental in preventing conditionsdeveloping in a manner favourable for Communist exploitation; on the other hand,if the appeal were refused, we should perhaps have more justification forwithdrawing the British battalion. Against the suggestion, it has been represented that there are in any case military and financial objections to leaving the battalionin the Southern Cameroons after 1st October, and that to raise the question in the trusteeship Council would provide an opportunity for attacks on our policy. ;,\10.   I invite the Cabinet  .     -   n , *(a) To endorse the conclusions of the -Africa Committee, that:(i) An official announcement should be made in Buea at an earlydate of our intention to withdraw the British force from theSouthern Cameroons when our trusteeship ends on 1st October.(ii) A consular post should he opened in Buea on 1st October.(iii) Military action should be taken against a terrorist camp asproposed by the delegation.(iv) We should remain prepared to offer   I million aid in the first year after the end of trusteeship.,;n (v) We should proceed with transitional arrangements for the ending-^i, : v , of Commonwealth Preferences after 1st October.     , -   ^ :(b) To consider whether Mr. Foncha should be encouraged to ; seek&apos; an-,!.!!,f . extension of the trusteeship status of the Southern Cameroons after1st October. ..Lord&apos;CUd &apos;y.&quot;&apos;r*;&quot; V    :  .&apos;;\&quot; i    -,23,rd June, 1961.   &apos;       , ....., ., V ;i,J. \\.
