International Economic ProblemsPresident Kennedy, after welcoming Mr. Macmillan and his party, said thathis Administration were faced with a number of difficult economic decisions, suchas the outflow of gold and the problem of reciprocal trade. What happened in western Europe, particularly in relation to the Six and the Seven, would affect theUnited States and their future prospects. He would like to hear Mr. Macmillan&apos;sprognosis.of economic developments..&apos; Mr. Macmillan said that, in his view, the Communist Powers were gainingground at the expense of the West. This was due to the free world&apos;s divisions.Only when these divisions were healed in the fields of banking, finance and tradingwould it be possible for the countries of the West to give the maximum help to one another and to the less developed countries. One reason for these divisions wasthe re-emergence of Europe; it was almost true to say that Europe was now a thirdforce. He and President Kennedy had recently had discussions about Laos andit was significant that Germany and Italy and even France, though now richcountries, were not interesting themselves in this problem. We must find a wayof operating our financial, economic and trading policies in such a way that thiskind of thing did not happen. We must re-unite the West under Americanleadership. This must be the theme of our policy.
&apos;    lOBMr. Macmillan said that there was a long-term and a short-term aspect ofthe economic problem. Both the United States and the United Kingdom were in temporary difficulties, and yet their two currencies were the reserve currencies ofthe world. They therefore had to endure double strain. One thing that must bedone was to put pressure on the countries that were running a surplus to induce them to disgorge it. The German surplus was a case in point. It was significant that this was almost equivalent to the amount that her allies spent in keeping troops on her territory for her defence. Paradoxical though it might seem, the problemof imbalance could in theory be solved by withdrawing these troops and abandoning the military alliance. It was true that plans were being drawn up to reduce thisimbalance by measures, which included increased sales of arms to Germany fromthe United States and the United Kingdom. Another short-term remedy wouldbe greater use of, and more flexibility in, the International Monetary Fund. Oneencouraging sign in our recent difficulties had been the greater co-operation of thecentra! banks in curbing speculation by individuals.Turning to the longer term, Mr. Macmillan said that he did not see how thefree world could continue to carry on four times the amount of trade with onlytwice the amount of credit that had been available in the past. It was therefore essential to increase the total credit resources of the free world and to increase the rapidity of credit movement. Secondly, it was essential to ensure that one countrydid not accumulate capital and sit on it. If one player in a game accumulated ailthe counters and did not put them back into circulation, the game could not continue. In the 19th century the United Kingdom had earned huge surpluses andre-invested them overseas. Since the war the United States had made vast resources available in aid. The rich European countries should now be doing the same.There must be an understanding that no country should sit on all the counters.The central banks might be able to find a way cf preventing the holding of surpluses.Capitalism would not work unless it was running at full speed. Unless the free world could organise this and it would be for the United States and the UnitedKingdom to take the lead power would pass to the Communists.Mr. Dillon, who was invited by President Kennedy to comment on Mr.Macmillan&apos;s remarks, agreed that the immediate need was to increase the possibilitiesof drawing on the International Monetary Fund under its existing Articles ofAgreement though he did not think that the United States themselves would wishto exercise any drawing rights this year. The countries with surpluses did not likebeing called upon for funds in the International Monetary Fund and it would therefore be necessary for the United States and the United Kingdom together toput pressure on them. Mr. Dillon said that he was glad we had been able to make some progress with the Germans in the matter of the purchase of military equipment from the United Kingdom, and the United States certainly hoped to do the same.So far as the long-term problem was concerned, Mr. Dillon said that a conditionof any solution that might be found would be its acceptability to Congress and, he assumed-to the United Kingdom Parliament. Anything in the nature of a worldcentral bank would&apos; involve some encroachment on national sovereignty. TheUnited States Government were studying this aspect of the problem. Anotherpoint that he wished to emphasise was that we must press on with short-termremedies and not talk to the European surplus countries about our ideas for long-term remedies, lest they should use them as an excuse for not doing anything inthe short term. Mr. Macmillan entirely agreed with this point.President Kennedy intervened to say that, if the United States lost gold for another year, there would undoubtedly be pressure on the Administration to cutdown either their foreign aid or their military commitments. He hoped therefore that the Germans would help both by taking a greater share of aid to less developed countries and by increasing their arms purchases from allied countries.Mr. Macmillan said that he hoped it would be possible to examine ways inwhich the military costs of the United States and United Kingdom in germany could be lessened. One possibility was that money might be saved by changing the location of the troops. Another was by making arrangements which would ensurethat money spent on stationing troops in Germany would be paid out again bythe Germans either in foreign aid or in purchases of military equipment. If the location of troops was to be changed, one way for the United Kingdom mightbe to have British troops stationed at home though still under North atlantic treaty Organisation command.
President Kennedy said that one of the difficulties for the Germans was thatthere was still a feeling in Germany that the British and American troops were an occupation force.  He fully agreed that a study of this problem should be made.President Kennedy asked how the problem of the Six and the Seven stood.Did Mr. Macmillan think that a more prosperous Europe would come out of it,with opportunities not only for the United Kingdom but also for the United Statesand Canada, or would the problem of the Six and the Seven develop in such a way as to cause difficulties for all of us?- Mr. Macmillan said that there were both economic and political aspects tothis problem. Modern technology demanded that markets should be larger; and,the larger a trading association was, the more useful it would be. His own dreamwas that the Six and the Seven might ultimately form part of a wider Atlanticunion. The widest possible trading area would thus be created. His feeling was-,that the United Kingdom and some of their partners in the Seven would have tofind a means of association with the Six. He believed that it was in the interests ofthe free world that Europe should be reunited and should ultimately look to an atlantic union. Otherwise the Six might constitute themselves a third force, andthat would cause difficulties both for the United Kingdom and for the UnitedStates. At present the main obstacle might be General de Gaulle, who saw in the six a political entity which would allow Europe to free itself from what he regarded as the domination of the Anglo-Saxons. But, if he went, the leadershipmight pass to Germany and it might not be Dr. Adenauer&apos;s Germany. the temptation for the Six countries to set themselves up as a third force would bevery strong. Mr. Macmillan therefore thought that it would be to the advantageof the Western world that the United Kingdom should be associated with thepolitical institutions of the Six. It could provide a stabilising element which would prevent either France or Germany from dominating Europe. He would like to seethis come about provided it was supported by the United States.Mr. Macmillan added that it was sometimes suggested that the choice forthe United Kingdom was between Europe and the United States. He did not accept that. He thought that we should all try to work together and that theUnited Kingdom could use its influence to make a bridge between Europe and north America. That was why, provided he was sure of United States support,he would like to see the United Kingdom in, or in close association with, the Six.&apos; President Kennedy agreed that the arguments that Mr. Macmillan advanced in favour of United Kingdom participation in the Six were valid. He thought thatif the United Kingdom took such steps now, when conditions were favourable, theeffect would be to tie Germany more closely to the West. This would be to thecommon good. But if the United Kingdom remained aloof from this Europeanassociation until after Dr. Adenauer and President de Gaulle had gone, thesituation would be very much more difficult&apos; He added that it would also be inthe economic interests of the United States and of the Commonwealth for the Sixto be broadened. It was true that the United States and some of the less developed countries, particularly in Latin America, would have to face certain problems, butthe free world in general would be strengthened.M0. Lord Home said that, if we had seemed slow in coming to the conclusion thatwe ought to join the Six, this was because we had to be very careful of the interestsof other Commonwealth countries. We must not harm them and so risk breaking up what was a stabilising factor in the world. Now, however, we were beginning tosee how we could deal with this problem without undue detriment to our own interests or those of other Commonwealth countries.2. North Atlantic Treaty OrganisationPresident Kennedy suggested that Mr. Rusk should open a discussion on thepolitical aspects of the North Atlantic Treaty K ^organisation (NATO). Mr. Achesoncould then report the results of the study ol Us military aspects, over which hehad presided.
(a)-Political, ,; :; - -m Mr. Rusk -said that the new Administration had been thinking a great dealabout the health of the-Atlantic Community. They felt that in the 1960&apos;s the atlantic Community would be faced with problems which would take it well beyond.the concepts on which NATO had been founded in the 1940&apos;s. Even ifCommunism did not exist, the birth of new countries and the recent developments of science and technology would call for far-reaching changes. As it was, theCommunist Sino-Soviet bloc had taken advantage of the turmoil to launch a new type of offensive. This was reflected in the communique issued by the CommunistSummit meeting in November 1960. There had been a startling increase in theemployment of Communist resources outside the bloc, and they certainly got ahigh political return on their investment. The Administration felt that we mustall consider the 1960s as a period of struggle for the survival of free institutions in all parts of the world,     &apos;   . &quot; ,&apos;Mr. Rusk continued that in this situation the Administration judged that the unity and cohesion of the Atlantic Community was critical to the survival of freeinstitutions everywhere.The tasks which it faced in the fields of defence,economics and politics were very large. Much would turn on its ability to achieveunity and to mobilise its resources. Both the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates were deeply committed in other parts of the world. Nevertheless,^ theAdministration felt that the unity and strength of the Atlantic Community mustbe a central object of policy. :If this were accepted, Mr. Rusk continued, what did it. imply for national policies? He thought there had hitherto been certain failures amongst membersof the Atlantic Community to give proper weight to the effect of purely national policies on the Community as a whole. The United States, amongst others, hadbeen negligent in this duty. Much could be done by improving consultation. not enough use had been made of the North Atlantic Council. Nor had it proved tobe a very effective forum for the solution of disputes within the Community. he hoped that the North Atlantic Council could be transformed into a forum wherethe national representatives would be men of outstanding ability able to discussaffairs &quot; up to their metal &quot;. Mr. Rusk also thought that informal sub-committeescould be established to deal with various areas, e.g., Latin America, South-east asia, &amp;c. The existence of such committees should not be publicised.; Anotherpossibility was that every six mojiths or so groups of distinguished men, who wouldnot be the official representatives of their Governments, might be appointed to assess what was happening in NATO and how it was getting on.Mr. Rusk summarised his views by saying that, despite the difficulties,far-reaching questions should.be discussed in the North Atlantic Council so thatproblems might be assessed before they arose in an acute form and a consensusof opinion developed which would make action easier when.the time came for it.We should make it clear to our allies that the health of the Atlantic Communitywas a central object of policy, and that the lesser members of it would be enabled to voice their views before decisions were made. We must look&apos;for ways toincrease, the weight given to the interests of the Atlantic Community as a wholewhen national policies were being formulated.     . .        &apos;-.;&apos;&apos; ](b) MilitaryMr. Aclteson said that he had studied the military policies of NATO, inconsultation with representatives of the State Department, the Treasury and theDepartment of Defense. With the President^ consent he gave the followingsummary of his conclusions.He had begun by trying to cost the requirements for 1962-66 which supreme allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) had sent to the Standing Group. Thiswas difficult to do, but it seemed probable that these requirements would over five years cost $25 billions more than the total of what NATO was now spending.He concluded that this figure was larger than the NATO countries could affordand that, in any case, it would be undesirable to spend so much in NATO havingregard to needs elsewhere. ;Hi From this starting point he had studied the military policy.of NATO. this seemed to have turned almost a complete circle. In the early days the theory, had
TOP SECRET

been that the shield forces would be able to stop an attack and thus enforce a pause in which decisions could be made. In 1956-57, when the failure to achieve the force goals had become manifest, the decision had been taken to equip NATO with nuclear weapons. The question whether NATO should be a nuclear Power was now academic: NATO was already a nuclear Power.

SACEUR had found that, according to his standing orders, he should use nuclear weapons at the outset of a conflict. This seemed undesirable. He had therefore introduced a gloss which had the effect of raising the threshold at which nuclear weapons were introduced and once again introduced the doctrine of enforcing a pause. This seemed sensible.

Looking at the existing forces, Mr. Acheson thought there was already very considerable nuclear power in Europe. But the conventional capacity was not enough. He had therefore recommended to President Kennedy that first priority should be assigned to the build-up of conventional forces. NATO should adhere strongly to the forward strategy. NATO conventional forces, using conventional weapons, should be able to deal with the Soviet forces currently in Europe, say, some 20 divisions. The object would be to hold off the enemy forces for two or three weeks. This would give a pause. But if the Russians pressed on, this would mean nuclear war. On non-nuclear forces, Mr. Acheson said that his recommendation was that the doubts which had been raised by the previous Administration at the December Ministerial meeting should be set at rest. It should be made clear that there was no intention to withdraw United States forces from Europe. The United States should express the hope that other member Governments would rapidly build up their own forces to the required levels and standards. This was not impossible, assuming that the French were able to bring back their divisions from Algeria and the Germans pressed on with the provision of the five divisions which would bring their troops up to the level of their commitments. It was also possible that Britain might do more. Thus, the first priority was to bring the conventional forces up to strength, to modernise them and to improve their mobility. One consequence of this would be a switch in the emphasis of United States aid from nuclear weapons to non-nuclear weapons.

On nuclear forces, Mr. Acheson&apos;s recommendation was that President Kennedy should make it clear that the United States had no intention of removing any of the nuclear weapons already held in the NATO area, and that nuclear weapons already promised and in the pipeline should be allowed to go forward. In future, however, the supply of nuclear weapons should have second priority to the needs of the non-nuclear forces. The provision of the M.R.B.Ms. for which SACEUR had asked would not only be far too expensive, but it was also a dangerous way of putting fire-power into Europe. It was undesirable that there should be a high concentration of these weapons in the forward areas. Sea-borne missiles were preferable.

Mr. Acheson said there were two inconsistent attitudes in Europe. Some people feared that the United States might be too ready to use nuclear weapons. Others feared that she would be reluctant to do so. These anxieties might be met by arrangements under the headings of control and command. There should be stricter control so that the risk of the unauthorised use of nuclear weapons would be diminished. On command, the allies should be asked to think out a set of rules. At present the President had sole responsibility under the law for releasing nuclear Warheads. In the case of the United Kingdom, Italy, and possibly soon with Germany, this was modified by special agreements. But this was an unsatisfactory situation. It seemed desirable that in the case of ground missiles and water-borne missiles the President should say that, until the allies had worked out some better system, if one could be found, he would undertake to use the nuclear warheads at present under American lock and key in Europe if Western forces were subjected to a nuclear attack or to a conventional attack which could not be contained. This would inevitably involve the United States coming to the defence of Europe with all its power, for no one would suppose that America would use nuclear weapons in Europe without using the Strategic Air Command. This should satisfy those who feared America might stand aside in a crisis.

The fears of those who felt that America was trigger-happy might be met by an offer by President Kennedy to honour a set of principles, which the allies could draw up themselves with United States participation, directing how and in what

He agreed that there should be :!imore politicalconsultation in the North Atlantic Council.

Might we be over-insured in Europe?&apos; : There, was theproblem of payments across the exchanges, and it was dangerous to make NATO;too strong in nuclear weapons, especially M.R.B.Ms. He was glad to hear that the;emphasis was mow to be changed back to conventional weapons,&quot; but, this faced, the^ Uiiited^^ngdom; with: problems.&quot; f;&apos;,  ::y;       :-:V&quot; Vy^t!&apos;^&apos;;A:.^In reply to questions, Mr. Acheson said that his idea was that nuelearjweaponsshould be re-grouped so that there was stricter control over them.&apos;!- He^did notnecessarily advocate&apos;: the &quot;-complete&apos;, elimination, of M.R.B.Ms. There should beconstant study of the.development and role of new weapons. He did not expect that if the President agreed to make the declarations he had recommended, these would be public. He thought they.should be undertakingsfgiven to the north atlantic Council.  ^0iuf0m::HP.^rfi :pj  jy i:t$U vn;: &apos;U :attack )iVi:Mi&amp;f0P:&apos; Mr. Macmillan said that the core of the whole problem was the revival ofEurope; The present malaise resulted from the feelings of the French,and Othersthat their&apos;position was in some way inferior to that of the Anglo-Saxons. one possibility might be that the United Kingdom should offer.Ito share its nationalnuclear capability with its Allies. Another might be to let the French, develop,theirs. -&apos; The West Germans needed us for the protection of Berlin and were.perhaps not very likely to take an: independent line. If the:French brought back,their army from Algeria,&quot; &apos;the difficulties in NATO might be intensified.;-&apos; ForGeneral de Gaulle would be reluctant to put the French Army under SACEUR.The Army meant a lot in1 France much more &apos;than&apos;it did in Britain or the United) States.- general de; Gaulle;believed. that:,the Army and the Church were the twobulwarks against Communism in France. Another way of posing the problem was&apos; to. ask whether France; was Ito ;be regarded as a world - Power or1 as&apos;- a&apos; european power. -Until General de Gaulle was satisfied that France was accepted as a world-Power he would; not; co-operate fully (with the West, whether in I NATO i or outsideit, - This was clear from the; attitude he was adopting over the Congo, Laos, nuclear tests and the choice^of a new. Secretary-^General for NATO.&apos; It went right through&apos;both the. economic and political aspects of-the problem of the six.: The pride ofGeneral de Gaulle and of other. determined men in Europe demanded that they;should have some fuller share of control&apos;over the nuclear strength of the-West.;They could not tolerate a. position in which their, future was decided by others.They were determined to put Europe back on the map.. There were certain signsin Germany that were&apos;alarming. He felt.strongly that the fundamental^fact was!,that the Europeans were not going to be treated as second-rate people.^&quot;, ;.       . -Mr. Macmillan made it clear that he was posing a problem, not offering a.solution. 1 It was evident, however, that tinkering with the powers of SACEUR wasnot enough.- It was also evident that a small.number of unsophisticated -nuclearbombs, which might not amount to much of a force, could&apos;nevertheless;oauseargreat deal of trouble. : r.-:        &apos;-:;:&apos;.::;&apos;;:&apos;:;-&apos;:&apos;. M, &apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;.      &apos;--&apos;    ll &apos;&apos; 11 &apos;,&quot;- - President Kennedy asked-whether there was any formula which might satisfy the.Europeans, or. would they only be satisfied.if they had a national nuclearcapability?  :.;v; :^    ::-&apos;.&apos;;-:&apos;.;&apos;&apos;&apos;-1l-fi        -. r:: - r;t.A ipfytiiiyihS&amp;ifyMr. Macmillan said that they must have terms of honour. Perhaps if theFrench had a national nuclear capability they would be prepared, to-.put it :back into some form, of pool. French feelings on this were strong. -They were jealous of the;special relations which the United Kingdom had with the&quot; United States.- They-didnot understand that this existed, not because we were Anglo-Saxons,: but because we had discovered how to work sensibly together. We had got to find some wayof meeting this problem. &apos; If President Kennedy felt it would&apos;:help, ;the UnitedKingdom might be able to go into the Six.- He thought this was possible&apos;^-&apos;     v&apos;&apos;;;i;
:^Mr, Macmillan agreed that there should be more consultation between thecountries of the West, and not. only in respect of the NATO area. It was unrealto suppose that, all member countries oould contribute equally. ;: There might,^perhaps be special groups for consultation and these might include others, such as:Australia and New Zealand and Brazil. . We might in this way try to bring Germanyand France out of themselves and. thus prevent a dangerous spirit from growingIwhicli&apos;would.destroy the fundamental purpose of NATO.  There must, of course,llbeiunity, but at the same time we should recognise a reasonable diversity within,j the Atlantic.Community.: 3^Europev.:^&apos;.;:.r /.:- i-&apos;r&apos;Mr: Ball said that he was impressed by the similarity between Mr. Macmillan&apos;s.;.views and those of the United States Government on the problem of the Six and the- Seven. The United States Government attached more weight to the political than&apos; to: the economic. aspects.  Here their objectives were two-fold, to maintain Franco-German understanding and to bind Germany closely to the West. Whilellthey^recognised that the relationship of the United Kingdom and the Seven with- the Six was primarily a problem for &quot;the countries concerned, the Americans hadI been worried at the earlier ideas of a European Free Trade Area which seemed^calculated, from the American point of view, to increase the commercial^disadvantages while weakening the political advantages of a united Europe. TheyIfhad feared that the United Kingdom, acting as a pole of attraction, might weakenI the forces for unity among the Six.  But if the United Kingdom became a member&apos; of the Six and brought her political genius to bear within it, she would provide an element of stability in the period of uncertainty which was likely to follow theI departure of the present leaders of France and Germany. Such a decision on thellparfcofc -the.- United&apos; Kingdom&apos; would &apos;also&apos;- confirm even more closely the special^relationship of confidence between&apos; the United States and United kingdom governments.  In short, the interests of all parties, on both sides of the Atlantic,&quot;fj would be advanced if the United Kingdom could see her way to become a member.I of -the Six. But if there were merely some economic accommodation between the six and the Seven, this would not only^ weaken the political value and potential of the Six but would also make the commercial problems more difficult for North:; America!- He hoped that the O.E.CD. might serve as an umbrella for furtherI; developments, and possibly lead to binding ties between the two; sides of the atlantic.   If it was a question of bringing the Seven together into relationship with the Six, this again might raise difficulties in so far as the neutral members,i.e., the Swedes, the Swiss and the Austrians, would be unable to play their full&apos;I-part in the political institutions of the Treaty of Rome.  He hoped therefore thattllthe-Onited Kingdom would take the lead and then to see to what extent the other:  members of the Seven could follow suit. - &apos; :; ;&apos; Mr! Macmillan remarked that the three neutral members of the Seven wouldin any case have to be treated as special members of a wider relationship.   He didI not think this would present any great difficulty.Sir, Robert Hall agreed and suggested that the O.E.C.D. might help over this.:  v    ;;&apos;; kl&quot;i     :.;:-;-;;i^.&apos; -Mr. Ball then turned to the question of the Commonwealth and the problemof tropical foodstuffs. Any merger of,the.two preferential:systems would bedifficult for the Americans, particularly in respect of their responsibilities... to non-member under-developed States.  He hoped that the United States and the- United Kingdom could tackle this problem together. u\?\ v4.Trade Questions ;::Y: :- --:&apos;1 President Kennedy said that, during the next two years, he Would have greatIjiifficulties with Congress over the renewal of the Reciprocal Trade Act (R.T.A.)and to a lesser, extent over the Mutual Security Act. &apos; In the Southern Stales therewas a:strong free trade group preoccupied with the problem of imports.of textiles;r J&amp;re-were also the North-Western States who were concerned about the imports&apos;of canned fruits into the United Kingdom.   He would need all the help he could; muster to get the R.T.A. through. He hoped that the United Kingdom Government&quot;tight be able to help with two particular questions. ^t. !&apos;&apos; .;&apos;: (a) Hong Kong .&apos;JJ;\President Kennedy said that the export of textiles from Hong Kong to the;UnitedStates had recently risen by 400 per cent.  This was a cause of great political
difficultypri the&quot; United States. He hoped that it might be passible for theGovernments of the United Kingdom and the United States to examine jointly thepossibility of devising some system of voluntary limitation of these exports, on thelines of the arrangement which the United States had made with Japan. &apos;Mr. Ball-said: that the/arrangement for voluntary^ limitation of exports of textiles from Jarpan was due to expire in 1961. This enhanced the difficulties causedby the increasing imports of textiles from Hong Kong. The United StatesGovernment recognised the political and strategic importance of Hong Kong andthe need to provide employment for its growing population, including the refugees from the mainland of China. They were therefore prepared to consider means by which any reduction&apos;in the export of textiles from Hong Kong would.be offset by compensating expansion of other local industries which were less likely to becompetitive with industries in the United States. It was understood that a UnitedKingdom mission would shortly be coming to the United States to discuss theproblem in this broader context. . ....Mr. Macmillan agreed that this problem should be studied by officials of thetwo Governments.(b) Canned Fruit - - ;\  j-i-President Kennedy said that he hoped that the United Kingdom Governmentwould be willing to relax their restrictions on imports of canned fruit from theUnited States. -, Mr. Macmillan said that this presented difficulties, since these imports were in competition with those from other Commonwealth countries. There would beparticular difficulty over citrus fruits, since these were of major importance to the economy of the West Indies. It was in the interests of the United States, as wellas of the United Kingdom, that the economic stability of the West Indies shouldbe preserved especially at this time, when their progress towards political independence was at a critical stage.: -Mr. Ball said that, even if an exception had to be made in respect of citrus fruit,it would be helpful if there could be some relaxation of the existing restrictions onthe import of deciduous fruits from the United States. This presented no special problem for the West Indies.       -   : ;Mr. Macmillan undertook to consider this question?. ...(c) Commodity Prices ,.President Kennedy said that it would be useful if officials of the United Statesand United Kingdom Governments could study the possibility of devising furtherschemes.for stabilising prices of primary commodities, especially those.which were of importance to producers in Latin America and Africa. . ,.. Mr. Macmillan said that he would favour such a study. ! It must however berecognised that there was no general panacea for commodity prices as a whole:each commodity would have to be studied on its particular, merits.Mr. Ball agreed that separate studies would be required in respect of particular commodities.5. Economic AidMr. Macmillan said that some of the particular trade questions which had been,raised pointed to. a larger problem of economic organisation which merited further study. . The industrialised countries of the world were now extending economic aid to the less developed countries, as a result of which the latter were enabled toincrease their industrial capacity and to manufacture for export. As this processcontinued, the less developed countries would be unable to pay their way withoutcompeting with industries in the donor countries.&apos;-. There was little doubt that, inthe long run,, the more highly developed. countries of the world would have to concentrate their production increasingly on.sophisticated manufactures and high-quality goods leaving the simpler types of &quot;production to the less developed countries. -&apos;;-.;): rl -* Subsequently;an a letter dated&apos;7,!; April, Mr: Macmillan informed President Kennedy that theUnited-Kingdom Government had decided to liberalise imports of.canned fruit (excluding cannedapples and canned citrus) as from the end of July 1961.
Mr. Ball said that he hoped that the Development Assistance Committee of theOECD. could act as a forum for co-ordinating plans in respect of the types ofdevelopment which could be encouraged, and also, perhaps as a forum for discussing the prospective shares of the burden for absorbing imports from the new industries,in a way which would ease the problem of structural adjustments in the industrialpattern of the donor countries.Mr. Macmillan suggested that there were three kinds of aid:&apos;v;V (i) Grants designed to prevent countries from joining the Communists orsimply to keep them alive, e.g., Jordan, Turkey or Iran.(ii) Aid designed to promote public utilities and industrial development..-: (iii) Aid designed to heip promote trade.The last 15 years had seen a haphazard outpouring of aid. A lot of it had stuckin the fingers of the ruling classes and had never reached the peasants. If we couldnowprovide it in a more scientific and efficient way, we could do as much or morewith less waste of resources. Certainly if we ourselves could maximise our own&quot;trade, we should be in a position to buy the primary products of the under-developed^countries. This was the most helpful form of aid, since the money was then more likely to percolate down to the peasant. He often thought that the question ofmaximising world trade was sometimes left out of account in our plans./ President Kennedy said that, if.the productive capacity of the United States&apos;were fully used, they would not have to worry about imports. Perhaps this situation would be better next year. Their present aim was to achieve a better co-ordinationM all types of aid. He was setting up a new central organisation for this purpose:and would like to know what the British, the Germans and others were doing in this-field.. There should be a greater effort to co-ordinate the common effort.Washington,7th April, 1961.

Mr. Macmillan had said that the North,fAtlantic Treaty \ Organisation (N1ATO) was not a nuclear Power. Legally this-was so, but the armed forces of many of the European Allies e.g., the Dutch, the-Italians and the French were in fact holding nuclear weapons, and in this sensey; NATO was already a nuclear Power. The United States control of these weaponswas.in some cases theoretical; there was not always a duplicate key and sometimesthercpntrol amounted to nothing more than a United States sergeant who was^upppsed to seethat the weapons werenot released without authority. There was-nojway. at present, of guaranteeing that those Allies who held nuclear weapons^ramdlirilfkct/s^k^he Presidents agreement before using them. This being so,ytlie problem of command was a very real one.&apos; It was one for the Allies, and iniipartiCular for General de Gaulle. It was true that Supreme Allied Commander,1 Europe (SACEUR) was militarily in command of these weapons, but the problem
was not military. It was one of political control. The Allies must make up their Wlminds whether they wanted to use the weapons and, if so, in what circumstances. IIn his view the United States Government should take the lead in posing this IIproblem and inducing the Allies to face it.- Mr. Acheson then turned to the desire of the French to develop an independent fnuclear capacity. He expressed his personal view that it would be a mistake tohelp France to develop nuclear weapons. Such weapons were useless without themeans to deliver them. It was very expensive to provide this. The French would realise in time that it was beyond their means. Indeed, he thought there was only Mone way in which they could develop a real nuclear capacity, and that was withSGerman help. The dilemma was that, if we helped the French, the Germans would Hinsist on equal treatment. If we did not and the.French persisted, they could onlyjHsucceed by calling in the Germans. In either event the Germans would acquire mnuclear power. Such a development would be very dangerous. It was not desired &apos; by Dr. Adenauer. It would finally extinguish any hope of an agreement to end. Inuclear tests. .There were, however, other ways of dealing with the French problem. For mexample/the United Kingdom bomber force in the United Kingdom, the United;!States Air Force in the United Kingdom and perhaps some I.C.B.Ms. could be mcommitted to NATO. If this were done, and if General de Gaulle were asked to 11work out suitable command arrangements, this would appear to him as a mconstructive move. It would give him control, at least to some degree, of a force Ifar more powerful than anything he could hope to have on his own. Mr: Acheson 1thought that this would be the best policy. The rules drawn up by the European mAllies for controlling the use of nuclear weapons would demand in all probability 1supplementary action.by United States nuclear forces stationed outside Europe. mr. Macmillan said that Mr. Acheson&apos;s ideas were interesting and constructive. 1They should certainly be studied. But they applied only to the European theatre. HOne of the causes of the malaise among the European Allies was their feeling that jlthey were confined solely to this theatre, while the Anglo-Saxons covered the rest Sof the world. The Europeans, especially General de Gaulle, were determined to 1get into the world club and to talk on equal terms.Mr. Rusk wondered if General de Gaulle would feel that the possession of a national nuclear capability would give him the right to be consulted about1 the Ifuse by the United States of nuclear weapons anywhere.Mr. Macmillan said that Mr. Acheson&apos;s scheme seemed to apply only to 1existing, and not to new, nuclear weapons.In reply to a question from Lord Home, Mr. A cheson said that SACBUR had monly military authority. His point was that the Allies should be told that they Ihad the last word in the use of the nuclear, weapons, and not onlytactical weapons fabut also Polaris missiles. &apos; ,. mPresident Kennedy asked whether General de Gaulle would or would not -jbe satisfied if the nuclear capability over which he had some control was confined 1only to Western Europe. mr. Macmillan said this was a difficult question. Perhaps General de Gaulle I might be ready to contribute to a common pool if he had something purely French Mto put into it. It was a prestige issue. The General did not believe that world war Iwas likely to occur. ;       -&apos;&apos; President Kennedy asked if it would make any difference if SACEUR wasfla Frenchman. Mr. Macmillan replied&apos; that this might please the French but it I might create difficulties with other members of the Alliance. &apos; The crux of the 9problem was that Europe had revived. It was worth working out Mr. Acheson&apos;s 1ideas in detail to see whether there might be something in them &quot;which would Ifsatisfy the European Allies. i!&apos; &apos;.i - -;President Kennedy asked Mr. Acheson to confirm that it was his idea that.;!mechanism must be provided to,make, it impossible for. the Germans to develop&apos;, fan independent nuclear capacity. Was it his idea that the Germans would achieve;;!this either if the French were given assistance or if the French called in the Germans&apos;;!to help them? Was it further his idea that his own scheme was the only way.toHprevent Germany from,acquiring nuclear weapons?:Mr. Acheson confirmed all these points.
2. Berlin^President Kennedy said that it would be useful to discuss Berlin while Mr. Acheson was present so that he might expound his thoughts on the subject.Mr. Acheson explained that he had been asked by the President to work with officials of the Administration on the problem of Berlin. He had arranged forstudies to be started, and these would be taken further on his return in three weeks&apos;time from a trip abroad. In the meantime,, it might be useful if he set out his personal views as they were at present. He started from three premises. First,there was no satisfactory solution to the Berlin question in isolation. It must be associated with the reunification, of Germany and could not be resolved apart from it: Reunification was very difficult, and was not likely in the immediate future.Secondly, the Soviets would press the Berlin question in the course of 1961.^Thirdly, there was no agreement possible which would not weaken the Westernposition. The ideas which had been put forward at the Geneva Foreign Ministers&apos;/Meeting in 1959 were not very good. If pursued they might make conditions.^,iworse. In short, he could see no proposals which were capable of averting a crisisand would also serve the interests of the West.Mr. Acheson said that we should not wait for the crisis to come upon us.^Berlin&apos;was the key to Germany and to Europe. If the West flinched from thistissue and sought a face-saving device, Germany would become detached from theWestern Alliance. He concluded that preparations to forestall or meet a crisis^should be begun at an early stage. Political and economic measures were not in-themselves adequate. There must be some sort of military response. The timing of this was a difficult question. .Mr. Acheson said that the question what tickets were held by Allied convoys;or who put what stamps on which documents were not important. The importanttest was whether there was substantial and continued interference with traffic tofBerlin, whether military or civilian. If this happened, the West must react. Theyacould do this in three ways:. in the air, on the ground, or by threatening a nuclear^response. - The third alternative was reckless, and no one would believe that the/West would resort to it. The decision between air and ground turned a good dealon technical military studies. We should proceed, with these quickly.Mr. Acheson gave it as his opinion that the West had not the capacity tore-establish access to Berlin against determined Russian opposition, whether by^air/measures or by land measures. What was required was a test of will. It mustibelmade clear to the Russians that the Western interest in Berlin was more^important to the West than blocking access to Berlin was to the Soviets. Berlinijvas&apos;; vital to us and not to them.&apos; M0)Mx. Acheson said that his own first impression was that developments had made;it: impracticable to force a test of will by air measures. If it was true thatground-to-air missiles could effectively pick off individual aircraft, then the^Russians might shoot down, say, one in two or one in three of Allied cargo planes lwhile; allowing Allied fighters to fly unmolested. Bombing would be no answer&apos;to&apos; such tactics. In this event we should not have faced the Russians with a real^test/of strength. But on the ground it might be possible to produce a situation inl^vhich the Russians would conclude that it was not worth while to interfere with^access to Berlin. Measures to bring this home to the Russians might help, to rally; the West. The employment of battalions or brigades for this) purpose did notfmake much sense. But the advance of a division, with another division in support,]%should be another matter. At least up to the Elbe such a force could take care ofJlitselfand could overcome such barriers as might be interposed. How far we should: go after that was a matter for further consideration. His own thought was that. There should be no resort to nuclear weapons, but that all the Western allies shouldImove: into a much higher state of military preparation and demonstrate that theyWere not prepared to abandon Berlin. He concluded by stressing that these wereRecommendations for study which did not in any way commit the President.fv,&apos;( \[ President Kennedy said that he had not come to any final conclusions, but he-was clear that the present situation of contingency planning was not satisfactory.^JVelought to go for more detailed military plans. The present plans did not faceSnlJRussians with a sufficiently stiff test. They must be made to realise the prospectslfof/.escalation. In reply to a question from Lord Home, President Kennedy, saidIfmaf the presently planned land probe was not strong enough.      v
. Mr. Macmillan said that the most important of Mr. Acheson&apos;s remarks wasthat the test on Berlin should come over the actual stoppage of supplies. It wasvery doubtful whether people would willingly risk war on the question of ticketsor stamps. What mattered was whether the inhabitants of West Berlin were underthreat of being deprived of the means of life. Mr. Acheson&apos;s remarks constituted a great advance. They implied that we should be prepared in certain circumstances to accept de facto the existence of the East German Government.     ;Mr: Acheson confirmed that this was what he meant.   The real test for aforceful Western reaction was whether supplies were moving to Berlin or not.Mr. Macmillan, said that he supposed that a division moving down a road andunable to take advantage of natural obstacles might prove vulnerable. Mr. Achesonsaid that he contemplated that, as soon as it encountered trouble, the division would ilspread out, perhaps six miles on either side of the Autobahn. Mr. McNamara said;lthat he; agreed generally with Mr. Acheson. The present ground probe ,was Ijinadequate. More definitive plans should be worked out through NATO.&apos;&apos; President. Kennedy, asked, whether it was the British view that an airlift was Ifpreferable. Discussion showed that much depended on the technical means likely;!to be employed by the Russians in interfering with an airlift, and on the question!whether the airlift had to provide for civilian as well as military requirements,Mr. Rusk said that what was bothering him was the ease with which an airlift fon the 1948-49 model could be stopped or seriously interfered with. The sort of Itruck convoy envisaged. as a first probe could be stopped by boy scduts. IMr. Khrushchev must be made to realise that this was a major matter. The meritgof using forces on the scale of a division was that this would engage the;!responsibility of Governments on all sides.Discussion then turned on how this matter could best be pursued. Mr. AchesonHimplied that planning had hitherto been hampered by British unwillingness toconsider more extreme measures, and Mr. McNamara stressed the need for effective training to prepare for any measures contemplated. Mr. Stevenson saidthat the matter was urgent: a crisis might be imminent. On two or three occasionsrecently Mr. Gromyko had made an obvious effort to indicate that the United states was under-estimating the urgency of a solution of the Berlin question. president kennedy said it would be helpful to know if the British thought the land probe was too hazardous.&apos; If the Autobahn was blocked, should we take to the air?; Weshould get more detailed information On what the airlift could achieve and thetechnicalities involved in it. We should then try to come to conclusions. Inaddition to deciding on plans and training, we should make a determination oncommitments. There was no sense in being uncertain in our own minds.Dr. Adenauer might want to know what we thought, and we should be in a positionto know what to say. He considered that the talks on this question should bebilateral in the first place. Mr. Rusk, in agreeing with this, added that time was anliimportant factor and we should move on to tripartite talks as quickly as possible and thereafter to consultation with the Germans and others, as necessary.Mr. Macmillan returned to Mr. Acheson&apos;s view-that the test should come on whether Berlin was deprived of life. This was both new and sensible.&apos; Until this happened, there was not really any issue. The conclusion of a separate peace treaty between the Soviet Union and East Germany was not in itself an aggressive act.It was on this basis that we should study the question of planning. Mr. Achesonl^agreed with all Mr. Macmillan had said. -President Kennedy said the question was whether we should say that a blockade of Berlin was the most extreme kind of provocation, or whether we should try to meet it through the United Nations or by means of an airlift.. He himselffelt that unless we looked very determined we should probably be courting a crisis?Lord Home said that, if the Soviets were clever, they would put the squeeze on berlin gradually. Turning to our position on Berlin at. a conference, he wonderedwhat our reaction would be if Mr. Khrushchev proposed a treaty.: At present our;juridical position was based on the right of conquest. This was no longer a strong^position. Might we not be better off if we could get a treaty with the Russians which!permitted Western troops to remain in Berlin? After all, Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s anxietywas to change the status of Berlin, and such a treaty might get him off the hook byjjenabling him to claim that he had achieved this.  Mr. Khrushchev might, in anyicase, wish to let Western troops stay in Berlin. He might be fearful of placing the];issue of war or peace solely in the hands of the East Germans. &apos;:
V-. Mr. Acheson said that he did not believe Mr. Khrushchev.was on a hook. Hep$is pushing on Berlin because he knew it was difficult for the West. His object was to weaken our position, and we should not help him in any way. Our presentposition:was good enough, and we should stick to it. . We should say that our-concern;was the reunification of Germany, and that this was being prevented bythe Russians. If we started talking about a changed status, this would underminemorale in Berlin and cause division among the Western allies.  ;;    -- Mr. Rusk thought that Mr: Khrushchev would have no difficulty in maintaininghis authority over the East Germans, and in any case he would be free to write intofany treaty he made with them whatever provisions he pleased. j The basis of ourfpbsition in Berlin was not really conquest. We were there because we had-a responsibility towards the German people under our protection. If we rested our case on a treaty, we should be on a slippery slope.V ; Lord Home said that, even so, the claim that we were in Berlin by right of&quot;conquest was wearing thin. Mr. Acheson replied that this was perhaps because our power was wearing thin.     :; ^;:- - Mr. Rusk said that we must present a better case to public opinion. At the endof the war we had made a bargain with the Russians. They had got all they hadbeen promised, and they were now trying to get out of their commitments. If we .retreated from this position, the. West would collapse.3. United Nations: ChinaPresident Kennedy said that the attitude of the Administration towards theCommunist Government of China was still a matter of great controversy in theUnited States. President Eisenhower had told him that the one thing that would bring him back into politics against the new Administration would be a change ofpolicy towards Communist China. There was no doubt that there were deep-emotional feelings about this in the United States. If Communist China wereseated in the United Nations at the expense of Formosa, there would be a wave of hostility throughout the country towards the United Nations itself. Another aspect of the problem was that, if the United States were publicly defeated in the united nations on this issue, her prestige in Asia would be diminished and the prestige ofthe Communists correspondingly increased. He was sure that Britain would not&quot;.wish to see United States interests harmed, and Chinese prestige increased, in thisway. The problem was how to avoid it. y$. ; - \ :   ^; The Administration had been giving thought to this. They would prefer totransfer the battle to a better ground: instead of fighting to keep Communist Chinaout it would be better to fight to keep Formosa in. He asked Mr. Stevenson tooutline various possible approaches to the problem.Mr. Stevenson said that he began from the assumption that it was an object -of United States policy to keep Formosa in the United Nations. The first objective&quot;should clearly be to prevent the issue from coming forward as a question&apos;ofcredentials. This would be settled by a simple majority vote,&apos;and there was plainlyno&apos;.prospect of excluding Communist China on that basis.   There seemed to be two ways of avoiding this. The first was to arrange for a resolution ,to be tabled1 inviting Communist China to apply for.membership. This would need&apos;a two-thirds-majority, and it was doubtful whether this could be obtained. - In any event the^Communist Chinese were unlikely to make such an application, which would beopen to veto by the Republic of China.   Another difficulty was that it wouldprobably be necessary for the United States to declare in advance that they wouldnot use the veto and that would cause trouble domestically. . The second possibility;.was a-&apos;&apos;successor State&apos;&apos;. resolution based on the argument that two States had^succeeded to the position originally designed for a single China and that each was^entitled to aseat in the United Nations. It was the converse of the situation that-/arose when the United Nations recognised that the two States of Syria and Egypthad become the single State of the United Arab Republic.  This would have the advantage that,Communist China would not have to apply formally for a seat..Moreover, it would circumvent the Nationalists&apos; veto, while leaving them in the Security Council. The problem of the Chinese seat in the Security Council couldf be. tackled separately after the Communist Chinese had become members of the-United Nations.ft?;,., Other possibilities were that there should be a resolution, which the UnitedfStates!would support, saying that;Formosa should not be deprived of her,seat,
IOqand others could then be left to make the running on the problem of communist china. Another possibility was to try to have the Charter revised in such a way that there would be seats for both the China&apos;s.From the point of view of the United States Administration, the first of these possibilities might be the best. They recognised that they could not hold themoratorium much longer. ,Lord Home said that the United Kingdom Government fully understood thedifficulties of the United States Administration in this matter. The last thing that they wanted to do was to put pressure on the United States Government. Butas they had recognised the Communists, if it came to a vote on credentials, theUnited Kingdom Government would have no choice but to vote in their favour.All the various possibilities which Mr. Stevenson had outlined assumed that formosa would agree to be represented in the United Nations as a State separate from China. Would they be willing to be seated under the name Formosa?Although it might not appear to matter what the two States called themselves,the fact was that there was only one seat in the United Nations for China.Mr. Stevenson said that this difficulty might be overcome by a &quot; successorState &quot; type of resolution, which would simply record that there were now twoStates in succession to the original &quot; China &quot;. .     ;Sir. Patrick Dean said that there were three difficulties about a &quot;successorState &quot; type of resolution: (i) that the Communist Chinese themselves would not accept it; (ii) that the Assembly would not much like it; and (iii) that we ourselves,if we voted for it, might have to sacrifice our diplomatic representation in Peking.. President Kennedy said that he would like to avoid this dilemma for anotheryear, as he did not want it said that the first act of the new Administration wasto seat Communist China in the United Nations. It would be easier in a year&apos;s time. Secondly, no-one could tell what the Chinese would themselves do in thecoming year. He wondered therefore whether some formula could be devised which would be rejected by Communist China but would enable the United states to improve their political posture (e.g., by putting the emphasis on protectingFormosa rather than opposing the admission of the Communists) and would put the whole thing off for a year.Mr. Rusk pointed out that, if the United States were defeated on this issue in the United Nations, the American public would scrutinise the vote to see who hadvoted against the United States and this would spoil relations between the UnitedStates and any country that had so voted. President Kennedy felt that there mightwell be a majority against the United States, and Lord Home pointed out that atthe recent Meeting of Commonwealth - Prime Ministers almost all had been infavour of seating Communist China in the United Nations.Mr. Macmillan wondered whether the formula could not reflect the simpletruth.that there were in fact two China&apos;s: the fact that each claimed the territory of the other need&apos;not matter: a resolution could be introduced that they should both be seated. He thought that a lot of countries would support such a resolution.&apos; Sir Patrick Dean added that one of the reasons why many countries, includingIndia, wanted to see Communist China in the United Nations was that, until thiswas done, it was impossible to tackle the question of expanding the membership of the Councils of the Organisation. It might be possible to enlist the help ofsuch countries in putting forward a resolution which linked the two problemstogether. Mr. Stevenson thought that there might be considerable support fora &quot; successor State &quot; resolution. If the United Kingdom could help, and if a goodresolution could be drafted, he thought there was a chance that it might pass.Mr. Macmillan wondered whether such a resolution might not be in general terms,e.g., &quot;how to deal with divided nations and how to expand the membership ofthe Councils &quot;.President Kennedy then suggested, and Mr. Macmillan agreed, thatMr. Stevenson and Sir Patrick Dean should give further study to this question inthe light of the discussion, and report to their respective Governments.4. United Nations: Colonial Issues ;  !Mr. Macmillan said that the debates in the General Assembly on colonialquestions were increasingly embarrassing for the United Kingdom Government.
lOiliSICN.NOinoiseveral small colonial territories which could never be viable as indeoendSSIS satisfactory- 7 nere Were als? &apos;a few wMch we felt obliged to retafn in oSSorevenfefeS f&apos;al m,g J&apos;nf0 desirable hands. But our outstanding prSwS,of the colonial territories in East and Central Africa, where we were seekine toestablish a multi-racial system. For this we needed hm M ^%&amp;&amp;MAmericans^understood what we were doing and wished to help. These resoion target dates could seriously upset our programme lor our African tcrritoa.,lne tolly of fixing arbitrary dates for -independence waa illustrated by Uio msituation in the Congo. Power could only be trarafenred when-.there wmi:tauthority strong enough to take it over. The problem was how to handle thisquestion in the United Nations when it arose. He was not sure that it was alwayathe best policy to seek to gain votes by running after them. We imjjjjhl do belter&apos;&apos;to stand on our record and gO&apos; quietly on with our work.Lord Home said that he was concerned at the situation in Ruanda Urundi.This could well go the same way as the Congo. Similarly, if the British were pushedout of Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, the result would be a belt of chaosacross Africa. The Portuguese were pursuing what we considered to be a negativecolonial policy. But if they were pushed too hard a Congo-type situation mightwell follow. He thought that the Americans could help to moderate the pressure.Southern Rhodesia was also a problem. If &quot;the pressures were too. strong, all that:would be achieved would be to push them into the arms of South Africa. he hoped that the Americans would help us to proceed at a pace which gave a reasonable-chance of preserving law and order during this delicate period of transfer of authority.president Kennedy said he was concerned about British Guiana.   He asked--whether there was any possibility of postponing the date for transfer of independence and whether Dr. Jagan would come to power.  It was pointed out that, although not finally confirmed, 1963 was the probable date for independence and. that on present form Dr. Jagan was likely to win the elections.Sir Patrick Dean said that the group of Afro-Asian representatives in theiXJnited Nations was mixed. The extremists were most vocal but there were many-nations who would like to follow a moderate policy, though they found it difficultto stand up publicly against the extremists on colonial issues. It would be a greatgain.if these moderate countries could follow an American lead which wouldenable, them to vote as they wished.Mr. Stevenson said that he had instructions from the President to try toexercise a moderating influence on colonial matters in the United Nations and tokeep in the closest touch with Sir Patrick Dean. The United States, not havingserious I colonial responsibilities of its own, had perhaps a greater freedom ofmanoeuvre. Fie did not think it was necessary that the United States and the^United Kingdom should always vote the same way. As regards target dates,the United States attitude was the same as the British: each proposal had to beconsidered on its merits. He was worried about the African delegations. Theformer French territories seemed sensible enough now, but no one Could be surewhat would happen when their present leaders had gone and the young extremistshad succeeded to power, and it was important to concert our policies there.-Reverting to the Portuguese and Dutch problems, President Kennedy said he hoped that the British could exercise their influence on Portugal. For his part,he had much sympathy with Portugal&apos;s problems, but the resolution againstPortugal had been so moderate that (the United States had been obliged to vote infavour.of it.: . tm,5. United Nations: Problems of Organisation ;Mr. Stevenson said that other problems currently causing concern in theUnited Nations were the enlargement of the composition of the Councils; the/position of the Secretary-General and the structure of the Secretariat; and the financing of the Organisation and of operations undertaken under its auspices.; On these matters there were no basic differences of view between the United States
and the United Kingdom. But these were all problems requiring the closestco-operation between them.Lord Home referred to the various proposals for changing the structure ofthe Secretariat. The idea proposed by Ghana that there should be a triumvirateof deputies beneath Mr. Hammarskjold was a dangerous one. It would enablethe Russians to by-pass the Secretary-General and to use the triumvirate as a meansof promoting their own proposal for splitting the. office of the Secretary-Generalinto three parts. - ;,Mr. Stevenson said that, while we should oppose all suggestions which would help the Soviets to advance their thesis that the United Nations should reflect a world divided into three groups, it had to he admitted that the present arrangements&apos;in the Secretariat would have to be adapted to meet the pressures from the new members. The Americans, for instance, were undoubtedly over-represented at the top level. Unfortunately, Mr. Hammarskjold, with all his great gifts, was not agreat administrator. This perhaps was a field in which the Americans and theBritish could help him. -It was agreed that the representatives of the United States and the UnitedKingdom at the United Nations should consult together further on thesequestions and report to their respective Governments.6. Netherlands New GuineaPresident Kennedy said that. President Sukarno would be visiting Washington on 24th April. There would be an opportunity then to speak to him about the indonesian attitude towards West New Guinea. What was the United Kingdomappreciation of the situation there?Lord Home mentioned the reports received from the Tunku of Malaya andfrom Dutch intelligence sources about a possible Indonesian attack in June. he did not himself think this was likely. Indonesian aggression was more likely totake the form of piecemeal infiltration or landings by small raiding parties.Nevertheless, the Dutch Foreign Minister would certainly be urging president kennedy to warn President Sukarno against aggressive action. Mr. Macmillanhad given him such a warning last September in New York. Perhaps the mosthopeful possibility now was to explore the suggestion of a trusteeship arrangement.The Dutch had already indicated privately at the United Nations that they wouldbe ready to accept such a solution, but they were unlikely to propose it themselves.Their policy was one of self-determination for West New Guinea.&quot;President Kennedy asked what the Australian attitude would be. Would theynot be concerned if there were no response from their allies in the event of anIndonesian attack on West New Guinea.Lord Home thought that Mr. Menzies would accept a trusteeship solution,though he was not enthusiastic about it. The Australians would certainly be concerned at the prospect of West New Guinea in the hands of an Indonesia whichitself might come under Communist control.President Kennedy asked whether the Dutch could be persuaded to, table aresolution on trusteeship in the United Nations before President Sukarno&apos;s visit to washington. Mr. Rusk did. not think this possible in the terms of the currentagenda of the General Assembly. It might, however, be possible to work out asuitable resolution and hold it in readiness for quick action in the Security Councilin the event of a crisis.It was agreed that Sir Harold Caccia and Mr. Rusk, in consultation withthe United States and United Kingdom Delegations in New York and with the. . Australian Ambassador in Washington, should make an urgent study of theline which the three Governments might take with a view to discouraging anIndonesian attack on West New Guinea, so that the United States government might be in a position to give suitable, warning to President Sukarno when hevisited Washington later in April. -[Washington, :8th April, 1961.   . &apos;t&apos;&apos;^&apos;&apos;y&apos;

Over Laos and the Congo their behaviour/had beencomparatively moderate. On the other hand, the Geneva negotiations&apos;on nuclear tests were now going badly. The Russians were being particularly difficult, aboutthe,composition of the Control Commission: it looked as if they might insist on:,a veto, and might carry this attitude over into the field of general disarmament.Mr. Bohlen said that the Russians seemed to be trying to establish a general principlethat in all. world organisations control must be divided between representatives ofwhat they called the three main groups in the world. Lord Home observed thatMr. Khrushchev had talked a good deal about this principle in New York inOctober. It also looked as if he might now take the line that he would not signa Tests Agreement unless it was part of a general disarmament plan. President&apos; Kennedy said that, if no agreement were concluded, there would be strong pressure in the United States to resume testing. Lord Home suggested that this could waitat any rate until the disarmament discussions had been resumed at the end of July.Mr. Rusk said that in his view it would he very disadvantageous to lose theopportunity of concluding a Tests Agreen - If this were lost, the question of tests would fall back into the confusion of the general disarmament discussions and. TOP-SECRET&apos;
little further progress would be made with it. The United States and UnitedKingdom Governments ought to press hard in Geneva for the conclusion of anagreement. Mr. Macmillan said that we should certainly not let the Russiansbreak off the negotiations without having first made it clear what were the main points outstanding (e.g., the character of the control system, and the number ofinspections). The public position of the West would then, be strong, s 15 ICC tllvRussians would clearly appear.to be resisting sensible propositions. Unless this was done, there was a danger that the nature of the disagreement and the extent of theRussians&apos; intransigence would be obscure. President Kennedy suggested that heand Mr. Macmillan might single out two or three questions which could be put toMr. Khrushchev direct. He wondered whether the fall-back position on thenumber of inspections had yet been put forward. Mr. Macmillan suggested that itwould be a mistake to make this final offer too soon. He supposed that it wouldbe difficult for the United States to avoid resuming tests if these negtiations failed.President Kennedy said that the United States would not wish to hold tests in the atmosphere. They might also find it difficult to hold tests in outer space. Theywould however wish to make underground tests, with precautions against fall-out.There would certainly be great pressure from the Joint Committee to resume suchtesting if negotiations broke down.Mr. Macmillan said that there had been hints in the Soviet Press and at Gerievathat the Russians would make the French position the excuse for breaking up theConference. The French would have their next tests in mid-April. Lord Homeexplained that he had made the point to M. Couve de Murville in Bangkok thatthe French really should not make tests at this time. The French difficulty was that,if they delayed for one month, they would have to wait for six months because thewinds became unfavourable at the end of May and were more likely to carry fall-out to populated areas. President Kennedy asked if it would be useful to make representations to the French about this. Lord Home said that it would certainlydo no harm to make representations; he had himself already spoken very strongly,but he believed that it would be useful if the United States Government added theirvoice. President Kennedy said that he would tell the French what his view was.He would say that he did not want all the blame for a breakdown of the geneva conference to fall on France.(b) GeneralPresident Kennedy said that he was trying to do what he could to improve relations with the Russians in small ways. He had removed the restrictions on theimport of crab-meat from the Soviet Union; the Soviet spy in the United NationsSecretariat had been released from prison; and a civil air agreement and a consularagreement had been offered.Mr. Macmillan said that it was difficult to gauge the present mood and intentions of Mr. Khrushchev. In 1959 he had certainly seemed to want a detente.It was not easy to. guess why he had made so much fuss about the U-2 incident,although this had certainly been a blow to Russian pride. It was, however, the factthat, although he had made a great deal of noise in Paris and at the United Nations,he had not taken any hostile action. Indeed there was one view that the summit meeting had been a success because it adjourned the Berlin&apos;problem for a year.It now seemed that Mr. Khrushchev was having domestic difficulties in the soviet union; and this might mean that he was unable to maintain his policy of detente.,Lord Home suggested that the Soviet Government might also have beenlooking again at. the consequences which a detente might bring in the shape ofinroads into their closed society. They would be under great pressure not to allowthis because it would sacrifice so great a military advantage. This might well beamong the reasons for their reluctance to conclude an. agreement on nuclear tests.2. BerlinPresident Kennedy wondered why the Russians had made no move on Berlin.Were they hesitating to move because they believed that the Western response wouldbe stiff. If so, it would be a mistake to do anything which might cause them to change that view.In the discussion which followed it was -suggested, on the United States side,that Mr. Khrushchev had been surprised by the strength of the Western reaction to his Free City plan.  Nevertheless, he had continued to affirm his intention to
make a peace treaty with Eastern Germany, and he was now more or less committed to taking action this year. He probably did not think that Berlin was worth therisk&quot;.of war; but he had to satisfy his satellites and to keep control of the worldCommunist movement at a time when the Chinese were challenging his leadership.In; the Party Congress in October he might want ito demonstrate that he could gainhis ends by means short of war, and he could instance such cases as Laos or the-Congo. It was possible that he needed a diplomatic success. It might be that the^Russians were deterred from faking action on Berlin by the threat of a direct clashIwith the&apos;West. If so, and if we had no new bargaining position, we should consider how to put the prospect as bluntly as possible. The West was not in a position tonegotiate successfully over Berlin. Perhaps &apos;the only thing which would affect the^Soviet position would be a move by the Federal Government to recognise de facto he East German regime! This could lead to important changes in East-west relations in Europe. But the West Germans lacked imagination, and they were notprepared to take any risks over Berlin,On.the British side, it was pointed out that there had been a very long&quot;negotiation between Foreign Ministers, which broke down because of the^impossibility of deciding what the&apos;position would be at the end of an interim period.It would be dangerous to go into discussions with no firm negotiating position.It would be worth considering the possibility of making a stand, not on the legalisticfview of Western rights in Berlin, but on the general thesis that the West woulddefend the Berlin population. It might be possible to tolerate a Soviet Peace Treaty;;with East Germany and a joint guarantee of a Free City for all Berlin. Would it.be a mistake to move to a treaty basis for our rights in Berlin, with all the dangersthat this might bring of denunciation or - violation?- If the Russians made their peace Treaty, perhaps it might be possible to counter this with a plan for. a FreeCity for all Berlin,In conclusion, Mr. Macmillan said that it would be desirable to examine the^political plans. If Mr. Khrushchev called for negotiations, the West should havea public position. It would also be desirable to consider what would happen if he: did sign his Treaty. President Kennedy said that these questions should certainly: be considered further. The suggestion made by Mr. Acheson for a revised military.Iplan should also be looked at. Mr. Macmillan added that there was always a dangerIthat, after Dr. Adenauer, the Russians might attempt to bribe the West GermansSby offering reunification in return for neutrality. If the Russians did not think thatI this was too dangerous for them, they might not be so anxious to settle the Berlinissue at the present moment.3. Bolivia .President Kennedy said that Bolivia was on the verge of being taken over by communist elements favourable to Sefior Castro. The mines were controlled byffiellieftTwing trade unionists and the tin had to be brought out on a British-ownedJrailway.., This railway company was in great financial difficulty because of the actions of the Bolivian Government, which would not allow the Company either to dismiss employees or to raise fares. If it ceased to function, however, the economy^the country would collapse. It would cost several million dollars to keep therailway going. Could the United Kingdom Government do anything to help?iHe^would be willing to send a member of the United States Mission which hadreccntlyreturncd from Bolivia to discuss the matter in London,&apos;... Mr. Macmillan said that he would look into this question.1.4. -AfghanistanMr. Rusk said that a dangerous situation seemed to be building up in Afghanistan. Troops were concentrating on the Pakistan border. The UnitediS.ta.tes were being drawn into the dispute, as the Afghans complained that Americanfarms supplied ito Pakistan were being used against their tribesmen. . Could the-(United Kingdom do anything to help?Lord Home said that this situation was probably no more serious than similar. .ones which had arisen from time to time in the last few years. The Afghans knewIthat-they would get a hot reception if they crossed the frontier and the PakistanisIfwere very resolute. But he would try to obtain an appreciation of the situation fromllPresident Ayub.
\0u5. LaosPresident Kennedy said that he presumed that the Soviet reply on Laos would come before the end of the week. Lord Home was doubtful about this, as,Mr. Khrushchev had left Moscow and Mr. Gromyko was in New York. TheRussians had raised a new point with Sir Frank Roberts about the kind of LaotianGovernment which would take part in the Conference.   This might give trouble.  :Mr. Rusk said that, if Prince Souvanna Phouma went to Moscow and.Pekingand not to Washington, it would be very difficult for Americans to regard him asa suitable head of a neutral Government.. Would it help if the King summonedhim home? It would be better if he were back in Laos where he could be kept under some control. Lord Home said that what Prince Souvanna Phouma: had Ssaid was that he would like a Government containing three Pathet Lao, three ..;Phoumists and a number of neutral figures. .1 uMr. Steeves suggested that Prince Souvanna Phouma&apos;s. ideas of neutrality mwere not satisfactory. Also he might not have as much support in Vientiane as -fthad been thought. Mr. Macmillan suggested that the King might ask Prince flSouvanna Phouma back, not as Prime Minister, but in order to assist in the iffformation of a Government. Mr. Steeves suggested that the Government shouldbe formed before a conference. Lord Home said that this would be better^ butit might be possible to hold a conference with observers from Laos. He had already,sent a further message to Prince Souvanna Phouma urging him to come to washington. Phouma had declared himself anxious to get rid of the Communistsgradually and had appeared to be a Laotian patriot, but there was no real certaintyabout his attitude. President Kennedy asked if it would be useful to press PrinceSouvanna Phouma again to come to Washington. Lord Home said that he didnot believe that it would be wise for the United States Government to pressPrince Souvanna Phouma, but he might perhaps send him another message.President Kennedy agreed and suggested that in such a message it might be saidthat the United States Administration were friendly to him. Mr. Bundy suggestedthat it would be something if Prince Souvanna Phouma would go back to Laoswithout going to Moscow and Peking. Lord Home said that he would try theeffect of a further message.6. DisarmamentMr. Macmillan said that there should be some discussion about disarmament:President Kennedy said that the talks would probably be resumed in June or July.Mr. Macmillan said that on tests the West should concentrate on defining one orjtwo points of difference.   It would be very unfortunate to break on the French jMdifficulty. ,7. Vietnam .:&apos;::imPresident Kennedy asked about the terror in Vietnam. He had been greatly 11impressed by Lord Home&apos;s remarks at Bangkok on this subject. Lord Home said 1that the answer to the terrorist campaign was of course a good counter-subversion i $movement. It was rather difficult to talk about this in public. There seemed tollbe 2,000 political assassinations a year and about 2,000 troops and police wereJIjkilled in trying to trace the murderers. President Kennedy1 said that the figures illwere very disturbing. He might say something about it in a public statement. IfLord Home agreed and said that this obviously could not go on for much longer.  viWashington,10th April, 1961.I

West IndiesPresident Kennedy said that he had made some preliminary enquiries into the/points raised in the aide-memoire which Mr. Macmillan had given him about theiWest Indies. &apos;&quot; &apos;&apos;- -&apos; - &apos;    !&apos; - As regards immigration from the West Indies to the -United States, a Bill wasbeing introduced which would give the West Indies a quota of 1,000 when theFederation became independent.    In addition, he had arranged for furtherfconsideration to be given to the possibility of allowing a number of West IndiansHo enter the United States for a limited period for employment as domestic workers.He would also have enquiries made into the point about sugar purchases, andwould arrange for a reply to be sent to the United Kingdom Government in due-course.. &apos;;.-.&quot;2. Shipping;. President Kennedy said that he would study the points made in the aide-fmemoire about shipping which he had received from Mr. Macmillan. One of theImmediate difficulties was the continued outflow of gold; and,: as long as thisIcpntinued, protectionist measures were inevitable. When the position had eased,it should be possible to relax some of these restrictions.Mr..Macmillan stressed the importance of shipping earnings to the national^economy of the United Kingdom. , ..&apos;,.&apos;...&apos;&quot;/.-.&apos; :,
TO oPresident Kennedy said that he would give sympathetic consideration to the irepresentations which Mr. Macmillan had made and &quot;would arrange for a reply Mto be sent to the United Kingdom Government as soon as possible.3. LaosLord Home said that Lord Landsdowne (Parliamentary Under-Secretary o(?MState, Foreign Office) had seen Prince Souvanna Phouma in Paris and had made -Mit plain to him that he would be well advised to visit Washington before he returned f jto Laos. Souvanna Phouma had intimated that he would be ready to accept an Minvitation to come to Washington either immediately or on 18th April.After discussion it was agreed that it would be preferable that SouvannaPhouma should come to Washington on 18th April; and instructions were.-^telephoned accordingly; to the United States Embassy in Paris.Mr. Macmillan said that he was glad that Lord Home and Mr. Rusk had beenable to settle the question which had arisen on the previous day about themovement of British troops from Malaya to Singapore. Mr. Rusk explained thatthe United States Government had had no intention of precipitating the movementof British or other South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) troops in thearea. President Kennedy said that he understood that British troops would requireseven days to reach Laos, but the para-military measures which would betakenfirst should hold the position for longer than that. Some or all of the following measures could be taken:(a) The appointment of American M.A.A.G. officers in uniform to units of theRoyal Laotian Army down to company level.(b) The use of B-26 aircraft to support the troops.(c) The provision of Thai gun crews.Such measures should suffice to hold the position for a time unless the Communistsgreatly increased their military effort. The United States Government would not,however, put these para-military measures into operation, nor call for preparatorymovements of SEATO troops, without first consulting the United KingdomGovernment through the diplomatic channel.President Kennedy asked when a further reply was expected from the Russiansabout the cease-fire and conference. It was recognised that, while it could not yet ;be said that the Russians had unduly delayed their reply, delay was to their .advantage. Lord Home suggested that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscowmight press the Russians for an early reply on the practical ground thatarrangements must, be put in hand at once if a conference was to assemble on 2nd May.4. United Nations: ChinaMr. Rusk said that he had been glad to have the opportunity for such a valuableexchange of views&apos; on the problem of Chinese representation in the United Nations.This was a very difficult problem for the United States Administration. He thoughtthat, because of the difficulties in the United States, it would be undesirable togive any public indication that there had been any drawing together of the UnitedStates and British positions. This did not mean that the differences need be exaggerated; but any suggestion that there had been a change in the United Statesview following on talks with United Kingdom Ministers would be very embarrassing for the Administration, who would be accused at once of giving into British pressure.President Kennedy said that this was the worst political problem that theUnited States had faced in the last .13 years. He hoped it could be handled very,carefully.Lord Home said that he did not propose to say another word on the subject iif he could help it, though he agreed that it might.be brought up in Parliament. :mr. Macmillan said that, if it were raised in the House of Commons, he would Mpropose to emphasise that this was not one single problem but a complex of^jproblems: it was not simply a question of seating Communist China but of dealingwith Formosa and so on.President Kennedy indicated that this seemed to him to be the right way of Wmdealing with the matter.
\0xTOP SECRET 3;S. CommuniqueAlternative drafts of a final communique were submitted and considered.After discussion a final draft was approved, a copy of which is annexed to thisrecord. It was agreed that President Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan should;themselves hold a short meeting with representatives of the Press, at which thePresident would read the communique. Brief personal statements would thenbe made by the President and Mr. Macmillan, but no opportunity would be given-for questions to be asked.mtoWashington,9 th April, 1961.h of

We have reached a very high level offagreement on our estimate of the nature of the problems which we face.&apos; We realise Iall too well that to meet these problems will require from us many sacrifices.Open and friendly discussions have served to clarify and confirm our common icommitment to those who care for freedom. We are in complete agreement.as to Ithe gravity and depth of the dangers in the present world situation for those nations Hwho wish to retain their independence and the priceless right of choice.While we recognise that the core of Western security against armed aggressionMcontinues to be the North Atlantic Alliance, we also discussed how our countries 1can help to strengthen the Free World as a whole.We have considered what measures it might be advisable to take, together with flour Allies, to ensure the cohesion, effectiveness and adaptability of the Atlantic?community in a changing world.To this end we have examined the world economic and financial situation, Jincluding the problems of imbalance and short-term capital movements; the need for co-ordination to meet these problems by increased utilisation of existing jfjinternational machinery: the need for more effective assistance to nations in an . Iearlier stage of economic development: and the need for maintenance of worldMtrade at. the highest possible level. We have recognised both the urgency and thellfimportance of further steps toward the economic and political unity of Europe.;!!We reaffirm our vigorous support of the United Nations and our determinationmto oppose the attempts currently being made to undermine its authority as an ;instrument for peace and security in the world. m we have given close attention to South-East Asia and specifically to lhe?Jcritical problems of Laos and Vietnam.We are agreed upon both the importance and the difficulty of working towards Isatisfactory relations with the Soviet Union..We also, reaffirm the determination of our Governments to do their utmost ato bring to a successful conclusion within a reasonable period of time the 1negotiations in Geneva for the cessation of nuclear weapons tests under effective Jinspection and control. &apos; 4We have talked as partners, but with a full awareness of the rights and interests!of the other nations with whom we are closely associated.   .&apos;./ i;8th April, 1961
