W. 1.26th May, 1961
RECENT DEVELOPMSNTS IN THE SOVIET UNIONWhile the new United States Administration have been settling intothe saddle and preparing to re-open the international dialogue,Mr. Khruschev has taken advantage of the interval to devote most of histime and energy to domestic problems.   He has continued to test the nerveof the West, and particularly that of the new President, in Laos and to makethe most of events in Cuba and the comos; but his responses have beenmechanical and his mind has been less on foreign affairs than on settingthe internal scene for the 22nd Party Congress in October.2.      This has involved some vigorous springcleaning.   Corruption andmismanagement in agriculture remains one of Mr. Khruschev&apos;s greatestdomestic problems, and his marathon tour of agricultural areas (two weeks in February and three in March) was accompanied by a sharp purgeof senior Party officials at oblast (provinical) level.   Since January,approximately 25 per cent of the First Secretaries of Oblast PartyCommittees have been dismissed or transferred to other work, and therehave been even more drastic changes in the Party leadership in the CentralAsian republics, notably in Tadzhikistan and Kirghizia.   The purges in central Asia, with their accompanying denunciations of shortcomings in agricultural production and of the falsification of statistics, are ofparticular   interest since it i s to these regions that Soviet propagandistshabitually point in their attempts to demonstrate the success of Communismin transforming under-developed areas.3.      The general tightening-up which has resulted from Mr. Khruschev&apos;recent concentration on internal matters has been reflected even morestrikingly in receit measures to combat crime and anti-social behaviour.The most important of these if the extension of the death penalty tocover grave cases of misappropriation of State and public property,forgery and terrorist activities by organised groups of criminals in prisons.This decree followed others empowering courts to impose sentencesofbanishment and forced labour on persons convicged of &quot;parti cipation inforbidden industries, private enterprise, speculation, begging, impropergainful use of private cars, use of hired labour, obtaining unearned income from dachas and land, use of illegally obtained building materials andother anti-social crimes&quot;.   This catalogue gives some indication of the size and scope of the problem with which Mr. Khruschev has had to come togrips.   For some months the Soviet Press has contained detailed storiesof speculation, embezzlement and dishonesty.   The Party is faced notonly with corruption and embezzlement on the grand scale, frequentlyinvolving high Party and government officials:   it has also to check the&quot;parasitism&quot;, petty corruption and spivvery which persists at every levelof Soviet society.   Hooliganism, illicit distilling and alcoholism havealso come under heavy fire from Mr. Khruschev in recent months.4.      The deep sense of shock which the extension of the death penaltyis obviously intended to produce on the Soviet public, and the impressionwhich it is intended to make on potential offenders, can only be gaugedif account is taken of the traditional Russian abhorrence of capital punishment,-1-
CONFIDENTIALS?Even under the Tsars, the Imperial Code of 1903 admitted the death penalty for only three offences:   high treason, an attempt on the life of the Sovereigor an attempt on the lives of other members of the Imperial House.   Underthe Communists, even when purges, torture and deportation were the orderof the day, there was no established imposition of the death penalty.   Itvaried from time to time;  the last occasion on which it was completelyabolished being 1947, only to be reintroduced again in 1950, and extendedsubsequently to cover treason, espionage and &quot;diversionist&quot; activities.5.      There are perhaps three contributory factors behind the severity of the Soviet Government1 s reaction to the increasing propensity of soviet citizens to feather their nests at the expense of the State:(i) The sheer size of the problem, as revealed by recent legislation,must constitute a genuine threat to the achievement of current economicgoals.   At a time when the fulfilment of the Seven-Year Flan demandsmaximum effort in all sectors of the economy, valuable steam isescaping through countless chinks in the boiler.(ii) Mr. Khruschev has good reasons for cleaning up Soviet societybefore the 22nd Party Congress in October.    The new Party programme which is to be launched on that occasion is expected to contain somereferences to the handing  over of State functions to society, in preparation for the &quot;transition to Communism&quot;.     Mr. Khruschev must be able to demonstrate that his policies of &quot;persuasion&quot; have succeeded better thanStalinist terror in preparing society for this transition.(iii) Finally, the stringency of the new legislation reflects the profoundsense of shock in the Soviet leadership at the state of affairs which hasbeen revealed by recent inquisitions.   At the very time when Soviet manshould   be getting better, in terms of Communist moraltiy, he is gettingdemonstrably worse.     The instinct for private gain, which should haveevaporated with the completion of the building of a socialist society, is asstrong as ever.   The regime has had to swallow the bitter pill of admittingthat social evils which arise in theory only from the inherent contraditionsof capitalist society and from the class war are rampant in a society onthe threshold of Communism.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.May, 1961-2-CONFIDENTIAL
