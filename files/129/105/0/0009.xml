Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1961C. (61) 59 Copy No. 519th June, 1961CABINETFINANCING OF UNITED NATIONS OPERATIONS IN THE CONGOMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe United Nations Organisation ended 1960 with its Working Capital fund of $25 millions exhausted and a cash deficit of $10 millions, which had to be financed by short-term borrowing from other funds available to the Secretary-General, Mr. Hammarskjold. This situation resulted mainly from the refusal ofthe Soviet bloc and others to meet their obligations since 1957 in respect of theUnited Nations Emergency Force (patrolling the Egypt-Israel border) and fromexpenditure on the United Nations operations in the Congo. The position wasaggravated by the arrears of contributions of other Members to the regular budget.The situation will get worse since the Soviet bloc and France will not and Chinacannot pay their assessed share of the Congo costs.2. lit was against this background that the 1961 costs of the Congo operationwere debated in the General Assembly in April. Although the financing resolution which emerged marked a defeat for the Soviet attempt to bring the Congo operation to a premature end for lack of funds, it also mirrored the majority feeling thatthese expenses should not be a charge on the entire membership and that virtuallythe whole burden should be carried by the Permanent Members of the security council. A further resolution was, in fact, passed inviting the next general assembly (in September) to consider setting up a separate scale of contributions for peace and security operations. It is likely that a recommendation in this sense,which might involve an increase in the United Kingdom contribution, will beadopted.3. By the end of 1961, if expenditures continue as now estimated, theuncovered cash deficit will probably amount to at least $30 millions and quitepossibly more. Without some drastic remedial action, therefore, the united nations will in effect go bankrupt early in 1962. In my view, the United kingdom has a strong interest not only in helping to keep the United Nations in being butin ensuring that it retains its capacity to act in defence of peace and security as ithas done in the Congo.4. My conclusion is that we must support efforts to keep the United Nations&apos;head above water if necessary to the extent of making voluntary contributions to the Congo operation in the form of grants or loans and continuing to contributevoluntarily to the United Nations Emergency Force in the Gaza Strip. While weshould continue our efforts to persuade members of the United Nations to meet their financial obligations, we must face the fact that bankruptcy is not likely tobe averted as a result of exhortations on our part.5. The Americans have indicated to us that they are thinking in terms of long-term, interest-free Government loans as a solution to the United Nations&apos;financial difficulties. Mr. Hammarskjold told the Chancellor of the Exchequerand myself on 31st May that he too sees this as the best, if not the ideal, solution.We expressed agreement in principle and, despite the difficulties which it may cause us in our present balance of payments position, I see no better alternative.In order to start 1962 with a clean sheet, having paid its bills and restored its59185
19 th June, 1961.Working Capital Fund to $25 millions, the United Nations would need loanstotalling about $75 millions. The United States might be expected to make asubstantial contribution and other Western Governments could no doubt be persuaded to play their part. It is hard to say how much the United KingdomGovernment would be called upon to produce but I would not expect our contribution to exceed $15 millions. Although the money would be nominally a loan, the prospects of it ever being repaid would not be good. Loans on a stilllarger1 scale would be required to place the United Nations in a position to meetfuture peace and security commitments. (The Americans have been thinking interms of a $500 millions fund of which $200 millions would be paid up.)6. An alternative to Government loans would be commercial borrowing,probably from United States banks. The objections to this course are that theGeneral Assembly refused to give the Secretary-General powers to borrowcommercially last autumn and might be just as unwilling to do so again; that commercial lenders might demand that their loans be guaranteed by Governments;and that a situation which would put the United Nations into debt with &quot; WallStreet&quot; might be politically embarrassing for the West. There are also political disadvantages to Government loans, but these are, in my view, more acceptable.7. It can fairly be argued that salvaging the United Nations by loans froma small number of member Governments would be an invitation to otherGovernments to default in their obligations to the Organisation. This is trueenough. Unfortunately no other way of averting bankruptcy seems to be practicable.I therefore propose that we should explore the problem further on this basis withthe Americans and other friendly delegations in New York.H.
