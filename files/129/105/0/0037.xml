I now circulatethis to the Cabinet.H. M.Admiralty House, S.W. 1,27th June, 1961.
ANNEXDIRECTIVE  FOR  UNITED  KINGDOM  MINISTERS  FOR  their discussions WITH COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENTSBackgroundAt the meeting of senior Commonwealth officials in London on 25th May theUnited Kingdom Delegation summed up the position in the following six points:(a) We have as yet had no talks with the Six collectively.   We have hadinformal talks with individual members of the Six (and we may have more). These have been in no sense a negotiation.(b) We now have, on the basis of what we have learned in these talks, tomake our own assessment of what terms and special arrangements we might reasonably expect to obtain if we were to decide to negotiate withthe Six.(c) After that, we intend to put the practical possibilities as we see them beforeother members of the Commonwealth and to discuss fully with them,in relation to their essential interests, what policy should be followed.(d) Similarly we must consult our partners in the European Free trade association.(e) Only after these consultations have taken place will the British cabinet decide whether or not to open negotiations with the Six.(/) If it is decided to negotiate, there will be the need for very close and continuous consultation and I mean consultation, not merely liaison with other Commonwealth countries.  We should have to consider what special arrangements were needed.2. We now feel that we have taken these informal talks as far as practicable.We cannot expect to obtain more details of the special arrangements that mightbe obtained without entering into negotiations with the Six.Purposes of the Visits(a) To explain the political case3. The first purpose will be to explain and discuss with commonwealth ministers the broad political considerations which point to the conclusion thatthe most effective way of securing our political objectives in the world, and ofaverting the dangers of continued division in Europe which we foresee, lies in fullUnited Kingdom membership of the European Economic Community. ministers would say that the United Kingdom Government on their own judgment of
(b) To discuss what are the Commonwealth&apos;s essential interests which we should try to safeguard5. The second purpose of the visits will be to seek the Commonwealths viewson what their essential interests are and to discuss the special arrangements whichwould be needed to safeguard them.6. Some Commonwealth Ministers (New Zealand and perhaps Canada) mayargue that nothing less than the maintenance of unrestricted Commonwealth free entry into the United Kingdom for all commodities on a permanent basis will avoiddamage to their economies, and that any special arrangements which limit theirpresent right to free entry would by definition be damaging and thereforeunacceptable. They should be warned that, even if we do not join the Six, it doesnot by any means follow that the existing access to the United Kingdom market which Commonwealth products enjoy can be preserved in full, in face of increased efficiency in production at home and growing pressure on a free food market fromabroad.7. Thus it would be unrealistic to suppose, whether we join the Six or not,that with all the changes taking place in the world the Ottawa arrangements could continue indefinitely in their entirety, any more than our own access to commonwealth markets has remained unaltered. Our aim would be to preserveas much as we could of the Commonwealth market in this country. We had on many occasions said that we could not accept the complete abolition of the system which would be involved if we accepted the basic principles and objectives of theTreaty of Rome as set out in Articles 2 and 3, without any special arrangements tosafeguard the position of the Commonwealth. In any negotiations with the Six,therefore, the United Kingdom would seek special arrangements such as would preserve the pattern of Commonwealth trade to the maximum possible extent, bothin the transitional period and in the Common Market period.these broad political considerations as well as of the general economic arguments are minded to join the Six, provided that satisfactory arrangements can be negotiated with the Community to safeguard the essential interests of theCommonwealth (and also of United Kingdom agriculture and of our partners inthe European Free Trade Association). If we are to discover what special arrangements can be made, it appears that it will be necessary to enter into formalnegotiations. It will also be necessary to take into account the serious political implications of making no attempt to negotiate and letting the present state of uncertainty drag on.4. Commonwealth Ministers may in general accept the political case for ourjoining the Six, although Canada will have reservations and Australia (or at least the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies) may see possible countervailing damage to thepolitical cohesion of the Commonwealth.
8. Ministers would say that we should expect the Six to show unstanding of the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the rest of theCommonwealth, and to recognise the importance of the Commonwealth to the free world, but we cannot expect them to let us have everything we should like.Whatever our opening position may be, we should have to be prepared in the courseof negotiations to concentrate on securing special arrangements for those items which are really essential to Commonwealth interests, because the more widely weclaimed exceptional treatment, the more difficult the negotiations would become.9. United Kingdom Ministers&apos; purpose would be to explore, in the light of the considerations above, what are the essential interests of Commonwealth countrieswhich they would wish us to try to safeguard in any negotiations.(c) To bring the Commonwealth to accept that we may decide to enter into negotiations with the Six in order to ascertain whether we can obtain terms which would meet our requirements, including those of the Commonwealth10. Ministers would emphasise that, at this stage, commonwealth governments are not being asked to express a view as to whether we should join the Six. They would say that neither the United Kingdom Government, nor theGovernments of the other Commonwealth countries, could commit themselves tothis until they knew the terms and conditions on which we might join theCommunity, and in particular the details of the special arrangements that it mightbe possible to secure in order to safeguard Commonwealth interests. Whether such terms and conditions could be obtained would not be clear until negotiations withthe Six had taken place. It would therefore be the aim of United kingdom ministers to create a state of mind in which Commonwealth Governments would accept (although they might not be willing positively to say so) that we should enter into negotiations with the Six in order to ascertain what terms and conditions we might obtain.Further Consultation with the Commonwealth i11. If the United Kingdom Government open negotiations, we shall need toprepare as will the Six themselves a comprehensive negotiating brief. UnitedKingdom Ministers would say that, in that event, we would like to discuss withparticular Commonwealth Governments those parts of the brief which are ofspecial concern to them (notably Australia, New Zealand and Canada). ministers would suggest to these Governments that (always supposing such a decision hadbeen taken) a very small number of senior officials might meet in London for thispurpose at a date to be arranged later.12. United Kingdom Ministers Would also raise the question of setting up some special machinery for maintaining close and continuous consultation duringthe course of any negotiations which may take place. It seems desirable to supplement the normal machinery (which will, of course, be fully used) and the
Commonwealth Governments with substantial interests at stake might like toconsider having small teams conveniently situated for the negotiations with the function of maintaining day-to-day contact with the United Kingdom negotiatingteam. For other Commonwealth Governments the normal machinery should prove adequate. During this period United Kingdom Ministers would keep intouch with Commonwealth Departmental Ministers and it may be desirable toarrange Ministerial discussion of specific points arising out of the negotiations.13. At the end of any negotiations, when we have a clear idea of the termson which membership of the European Economic Community is open to us, theUnited Kingdom Government will have to reach a final decision looking at the&quot; package &quot; as a whole on whether or not the terms are such as to justify ourjoining the Six. The Commonwealth will be fully in the picture and it may wellbe that at that point a full Commonwealth conference will be desirable.14. United Kingdom Ministers may be pressed to have a commonwealth conference before that indeed to call one in the immediate future. If they are,they would say that such a conference would have little value until there is a concreteproposition to be discussed (which there will not be until negotiations with the six have gone some way), but they might undertake to find out the wishes of theother Commonwealth countries. In general United Kingdom Ministers woulddiscourage any such suggestion as far as they can.Publicity15. United Kingdom Ministers (and Commonwealth Ministers) will have togive some account of the talks to the Press. United Kingdom officials are preparing a draft communique for this purpose. It is essential that nothing should be said in one country which would prejudice subsequent discussion in the other countries.But the whole question of publicity already difficult enough will be made muchmore difficult if Commonwealth Governments volunteer independent statements on their own responsibility. United Kingdom Ministers would therefore stress the importance of the closest prior consultation before any statements are madein order to avoid weakening the negotiating position.-Summary of Aims16.   United Kingdom Ministers&apos; aims can be summarised as follows:(a) To bring Commonwealth Governments to understand that the broadpolitical (and economic) case for our joining the Six justifies an attemptto find out whether we can obtain terms and conditions which would meet our requirements, including those of the Commonwealth.(b) To find out from Commonwealth Governments what are the essential interests which they would wish us to try to safeguard.
(c) To bring the Commonwealth to accept that we may decide to enter into negotiations with the Six in order to ascertain whether we can obtainterms which would meet our requirements, including those of theCommonwealth.(d) To encourage the Commonwealth to make the arrangements necessary forthe closest possible consultation in the period ahead.(e) To avoid a Commonwealth conference until we have had negotiations withthe Six and have formed a clear idea of the terms on which membership of the Community would be open to us, and before we take our finaldecision.26th June, 1961.
