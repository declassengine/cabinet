(61) 9719th July, 1961CABINETEAST-WEST relations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs it is clear that we are entering a period of increased tension in our relations withthe Soviet Union. I think my colleagues will find it useful to have the texts of fiverecent public statements of Soviet policy namely (a) the aide-memoire on nuclear tests and disarmament given to President Kennedy on Germany and Berlin, (b) the parallel aide-memoire on Germany and Berlin, (c) Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s radio and television speech of 15th June, (d) his speech to a mass meeting at the Kremlin on21st June, and (e) his speech at a Soviet-North Vietnamese friendship gathering on28th June, of which the second half is entirely about Germany and Berlin. I am alsocirculating (/) an account by Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow, Sir FrankRoberts, of a private conversation with Mr. Khrushchev about Berlin and theGerman question.2. These texts are attached at Annexes B, C, D, E, F and G. There are minorvariations between them, but the general line, especially on Berlin, is consistent. the texts are covered by a Memorandum at Annex A giving a general outline of currentSoviet policy as I see it. Briefly the Soviet leaders seem to have arrived at the belief that no important world problem can any longer be settled without their agreement,and that in some cases they can now impose their own solutions. This belief derives from reasonable confidence in their own strength, and a more doctrinaireassessment of Western weakness. It results in a militant conception of peaceful co-existence reinforced by the knowledge that the Chinese and other communistswithin and outside the Soviet Union have considered their policy up to date toosoft. (Paragraphs 1-10.)Germany and Berlin3. The latest Soviet proposals suggest that they are ready to take unilateral action, but have not discounted the possibility of achieving results by negotiationin conditions favourable to themselves. Mr. Khrushchev intends in any case to sign his peace treaty with East Germany by the end of the year. His minimumobjectives in so doing are:(a) To establish the East German frontier.(b) To force the West into some de facto recognition of the DeutscheDemokratische Republik (D.D.R.).In the longer term, he wants:(c) To stop the flow of refugees.(d) To get the Western troops out of Berlin.(e) To integrate Berlin with the D.D.R.(Paragraphs 11-19.)59324B
Disarmament4. Mr. Khrushchev appears to have lost any faith in the desirability of negotiating a disarmament agreement with the West. He must be expected to break off serious negotiations and launch a new propaganda campaign with the object offorcing Western Governments to accept Soviet proposals or discrediting us in the eyes of world opinion.  (Paragraphs 20-22.)Nuclear Tests,,v t    5.   Mr. Khrushchev has also lost interest in the possibility of a ban for its own- sake. He will now try to manoeuvre the United States into resuming tests and will then do the same himself. (Paragraph 23.)Laos6. Mr. Khrushchev will try to give us enough encouragement to deter theUnited States or the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation from intervening, while at the same time doing nothing to prejudice the possibility of an eventual take-over of the country by the communists. (Paragraph 24.)Foreign Office, S.W. 1,12th July, 1961.
ANNEX AEAST-WEST RELATIONSintroductionOver the whole spectrum of international affairs, the Soviet leaders seem tohave arrived at the belief that no important world problem can any longer besettled without their agreement. This belief is reflected in their toughness of attitude on individual problems such as Laos and disarmament; it is institutionalisedin the troika proposal, involving a built-in veto on any executive action, which theyhave now put forward in relation to nuclear tests as well as to the United NationsSecretariat.2. On Germany and Berlin the Russians go further; they seem to believe thatthey are now strong enough in this particular context to impose or negotiate asettlement which would involve at the very least an important consolidation oftheir position in Eastern Europe. The following are some of the causes of their determination to pursue a forward policy.Soviet Strength3. Militarily, Mr. Khrushchev has said, even the most inveterate enemies ofthe Soviet Union now concede that she is the strongest Power in the world.Economically, Russia expects to overtake the United States in total production by1970 and in per capita production soon afterwards. Mr. Khrushchev may not entirely believe these claims, and he certainly does not want to put the first to the test of war, but they colour his whole thinking.4. Internally, the Soviet Union is on the eve of the XXIInd Party Congress.The chief item on the agenda is expected to be the transition from socialism(characterised in Soviet thinking by the slogan &quot; to each according to his work &quot;,and involving strict controls) to communism (a state of comparative economicplenty &quot; to each according to his need &quot;). It is possible that a definite schedule willbe laid down for the progress of the Soviet Union towards communism. Againstthe background of severe agricultural shortcomings, and a good deal of openlyacknowledged and criticised apathy and spivvery, it seems doubtful whether therewill in fact be any spectacular transition in the near future. Nevertheless some newformula is likely to be produced, the effect of which will be to bring the vision of communism appreciably closer. The significance of such a step should not beunderestimated. For the true believer, communism represents the final stage of mankind&apos;s achievement in the political, economic and social spheres. The prospectof its establishment in the Soviet Union will be of millenary significance for theparty, and the general public will certainly be infected by their enthusiasm since itwill minister to their national pride.5. The Russians also take comfort from what appears to them as the spread of their sphere of influence abroad. As they are fond of saying, one-third of theworld&apos;s population now live under socialism. And although it is 10 years sincecommunists came to power in any country, their power and prestige has much increased their capacity to win friends and influence people (if only by frighteningthem).Capitalist Weakness6. The counterpart of the advancement of socialism is the decay ofcapitalism. Here again, to Russian eyes, events have only confirmed the predictionsof Marx and Lenin. In &quot; the decisive sphere of human endeavour, the sphere ofmaterial production &quot;, the West is falling behind in rate of growth. In the soviet union industrial production is increasing by 10 per cent, a year, compared with3 per cent, in the United States. In addition, the Russians see evidence of ourdecadence in our economic difficulties and social problems. Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s&quot; worn-out mare of capitalism &quot; is much more than a figure of speech for him andfor his audiences. Indeed many of the latter are probably more confident of ourdecline than they are of their own progress. The idea of a gradual transformationof capitalism,&apos; undetermined by Marxist influence, is quite foreign to Marxist orRussian logic.59324
7. The apparent weakening of Western influence abroad is also attributed todecadence. Our colonies are melting away, and Marxist economists do not expectus to survive for long without the raw materials and the markets which they are alleged to have provided. In Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, Westerninfluence is no longer paramount. Cuba is only the latest example of a process which the Russians regard as continuous and inevitable. The Commonwealth,like the Welfare State, is a phenomenon which does not fit into their scheme of history, and is therefore usually ignored. The idea that a newly or genuinelyindependent country could for long be seriously opposed to communist or attachedto democratic principles is probably beyond the grasp of the Soviet leaders.Mr. Khrushchev may genuinely think, as he sometimes says, that in dividing theworld into three classes, communist, capitalist and neutral, he is displaying amoderation for which we should be thankful.Peaceful Co-existence8. Mr. Khrushchev has given us no excuse for misunderstanding this famousslogan, which has only the slightest restraining influence on his policies. &quot; peaceful co-existence &quot; is &quot; a form of class struggle between socialism and capitalism &quot;,fought by every means short of full-scale war. Most recently, in his speech of15th June, Mr. Khrushchev has made it clear that peaceful co-existence, so far fromcontaining the spread of communism, in fact presupposes it.The Sino-Soviet Dispute9. Conviction of strength and of moving with the tide of history inclines theSoviet leaders to a tough policy. The knowledge that the Chinese regard soviet policy towards the West as far too soft must now also be a sizeable factor in Sovietthinking. It gives them another reason to be chary of making concessions andeager for quick results.The Points at Issue10. This is the spirit in which the Soviet leaders approach the current points of disagreement with the West. Even granted that their public statements often go beyond their real convictions, it seems clear that the general mood of the leaders isone of self-confidence and vigour. The following paragraphs deal successivelywith the Soviet attitude on Germany and Berlin, Disarmament and Nuclear Tests,and finally Laos.Germany and Berlin11. The problem of Germany and Berlin must irritate Mr. Khrushchev in several ways:(a) The absence of a settlement is a failure which contrasts with Soviet successelsewhere.(b) It is also out of keeping with the new balance of power as the Russianssee it.(c) Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s personal prestige (not least vis-a-vis the Chinese) hasbeen engaged since his first ultimatum of November 1958.(d) The present situation prevents the consolidation of the East German State,whose present weakness discredits and debilitates the whole satellitesystem, and even makes its whole future questionable.(e) The growth of the power of the Federal German Republic must begenuinely alarming to any Russian. Mr. Khrushchev cannot crush theFederal German Chancellor, Dr. Adenauer, but Berlin provides anopportunity to clip his wings.12. This problem is treated at length in the aide-memoire, handed byMr. Khrushchev to President Kennedy, and is again referred to in three of his recent speeches. There are some ambiguities, but the general argument is thesame. The continued absence of a peace treaty between Germany and herconquerors is an anomaly and a source of danger. It is time to &quot; draw a line underthe Second World War &quot;, to &quot; put a seal on the position which actually exists &quot;.The starting point must be &quot; the de facto and de jure situation now existing &quot;. east germany is a sovereign State, having East Berlin as its capital. West Berlin iseconomically and culturally linked with West Germany, but does not form part ofit.  The obvious solution is that the victorious Powers should sign a single peace
treaty with the two German States. Alternatively, there could be separate treaties with each of the two German States. In any case, West Berlin must be given adefinite international status, which Mr. Khrushchev suggests should be that ofa free city. But whether or not the Western Allies and the Federal Republicagree with these plans, the Soviet Union intends, together with other &quot; peaceloving &quot;States, to sign a treaty with East Germany &quot; at the end of the year &quot;. After that,&quot; countries wishing to maintain ties with West Berlin will have to reach agreementwith the German Democratic Republic on ways of access to West Berlin and communications with the city &quot;. And &quot; if any country . . . crosses the frontiers land, air or water of another, that country will assume full responsibility forthe consequences of the aggression and will receive a proper rebuff &quot;; in other words, an Allied airlift no less than a land probe would be likely to evoke a Sovietresponse.13. An alternative plan is elaborated in the aide-memoire. The Four powers should give the two German States six months to reach agreement on reunificationand a peace settlement, and should declare in advance that they will accept any agreement that may be reached. At the end of this time the Powers will sign asingle German Peace Treaty, if the Germans have reached agreement among themselves, or two separate treaties or a treaty with one half only, if they havenot. In his speech of 28th June Mr. Khrushchev said that he was ready to discuss with the West the problem of Germany as a whole, but only on the understandingthat the Federal Republic and the D.D.R should have an equal voice in decidingtheir own future.14. All these Soviet proposals are flatly contrary to the position hithertoadopted by the West. There are indications that the Russians do not discountand might indeed prefer the possibility of negotiating a solution suitable to them(see paragraph 18) before signature of a peace treaty. But if that is not possible before the end of the year, they seem to be prepared to go ahead and sign a separate peace treaty.15. They know that this method of proceeding may bring about a major crisis,but believe that (a) while it lasts, they are better able to withstand it than we are,and (b) it can be solved with some substantial gains to themselves, given the vulnerability of the Western position in Berlin to pressure short of nuclear war,and the unwillingness of the West to take any nuclear initiative.16. They are preparing for a crisis in various ways. The 20th anniversary of Hitler&apos;s attack on the Soviet Union was made the occasion for warning theirown people that the &quot; imperialist&quot;, who started the last war, are busy trying to start another, and that the Soviet Union is strong enough and well enough preparedto knock these attempts on the head or, if another war comes, to win it. At thesame time, the world in general and the Western Powers are being assured that theRussian position on Germany as a whole is very reasonable. Fear of German&quot; revanchism &quot; and the desire to fix the German frontiers are sentiments likelyto arouse wide sympathy. Refusal to allow all-German elections is parallel toa similar Western refusal in Vietnam. Signature of a separate peace treaty withEast Germany is parallel to the Western signature of a peace treaty with Japan in1951 against Soviet wishes. The Allied position in West Berlin will be secured,and there is no propaganda from Mr. Khrushchev (as there was in 1958) aboutintolerable espionage activities, or about the flow of refugees.17. Failing any dramatic developments (e.g., a substantial United Nationsresolution on Berlin) before then, we must expect Mr. Khrushchev to maintainthese propaganda lines up to the XXIInd Party Congress in October, and to use this Congress as a platform to rally patriotic feeling and endorse his Berlin policy.Thereafter he will feel freer and even more committed to carry out his plan andto sign a treaty with East Germany at the end of the year.18. The peace treaty with East Germany is obviously not an end in itself,though it will confer some extra prestige on the D.D.R. Mr. Khrushchev&apos;sminimum objectives in this whole operation are no doubt to:(a) Force the Western Allies into some de facto recognition of the D.D.R. inorder to secure access to Berlin (he himself said that de jure recognitionwould not be necessary for this purpose).(b) Achieve a firmer and more widely recognised definition of the East german frontier (the emphasis on this point in Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s speech of15th June was considerable).
19. It is possible that in return for satisfaction on these points in advance hewould give some limited guarantee of the Western position in Berlin. After theminimum objectives were achieved, there would remain the major tasks of stopping the flow of refugees to West Germany via West Berlin, in order to consolidate theD.D.R., and (if there were no agreement to the contrary) of squeezing out the troops of the Western Powers, in order to absorb West Berlin into the D.D.R. TheChairman of the East German Council of State, Herr Ulbricht, will be quite as much concerned with the first as with the second (indeed he has indicated quite clearly ina Press conference that the flow of refugees would be stopped after a peace treaty).Obviously there would be greater opportunities for applying the screw; but thetempo at which it would be done might well be gradual. This is a question onwhich Mr. Khrushchev himself may not have made up his mind. There are manyimponderables for both sides. Mr. Khrushchev must be as uncertain of our intentions as we are of his. At least so far as Western troops are concerned, hewill not wish to put responsibility for decisions entirely into the hands of HerrUlbricht; nor will he want the signature of the treaty in itself to appear to be thecause of a crisis. Thus it will be only prudent for him to retain some grip on eventsafter the treaty has been signed, and moreover to ensure that acute needling does notbegin at once. The Chinese might be dissatisfied with the extent of Mr. Khrushchev&apos;striumph in such a case; but the Russian public, which has been warned of thepossibility of commercial and diplomatic blockade, and of all-out war if a peace treaty were signed, might be very happy at the results.Disarmament and Nuclear Tests20. Six months ago, on the evidence of the line which Mr. Khrushchev hadtaken with the Chinese at the Moscow Conference in December, the Soviet leadersappeared to be genuinely convinced that a negotiated disarmament agreement wasboth a desirable and a feasible objective, though over-optimistic about their ability to force on the Western Powers an agreement favourable to themselves. The sameappeared to be true of their attitude on the banning of nuclear tests, if only becausewithout this they were obviously unlikely to get an agreement on disarmament. Thelatest evidence, however, points the other way on both subjects.21. On disarmament, Mr. Khrushchev has expressed the belief that theWestern Powers &quot; did not and, to be frank, do not want disarmament to this day &quot;.In the bilateral talks in Washington the Soviet delegate has argued that further negotiations are useless unless the Soviet Union and the United States can reachbasic agreement at the outset on the substance of the problem which must inpractice be on their terms. Simultaneously, an article in the Soviet foreign affairsjournal &quot; International Life &quot; seems designed to prepare the ground for the failureof the Washington talks and to throw the blame on the Americans in advance.22. All this suggests that Mr. Khrushchev for the present has given up hopeof reaching, or sees no need to reach, agreement with the West on disarmament bymeans of negotiations. There is a passage in his speech of 21st June which revealshow his mind is moving. (In effect, it does no more than echo the &quot; Appeal to the peoples of all the World &quot; issued after the Moscow Conference of Communist parties in December 1960.) &quot; All peoples &quot;, Mr. Khrushchev says, &quot; must realise the seriousnature of the present situation and bring pressure to bear on those governments which obstruct the solution of the disarmament problem . . . All people who wantpeace can and must compel the Governments of the capitalist countries to acceptdisarmament&quot;. In the light of these words we must expect the Soviet Governmentto break off the Washington talks at some convenient moment, and then to mobilisea propaganda campaign against the Western Governments through all the availablemedia, including the United Nations, the front organisations and national groupssuch as C.N.D., the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, with the object ofcompelling us to accept their proposals for &quot; general and complete disarmament&quot;first and control afterwards, or at least of exposing us to international censure asfrustrating an agreement.23. A similar calculation seems to lie behind the Soviet volte-face on nuclear tests. From being ready to negotiate a ban on the basis of a control system whoseday-to-day work would be supervised by a single neutral Administrator, theyhave switched to insistence on the Administrator^ replacement by a three-manboard, on the standard troika pattern, and a suggestion that nuclear tests and disarment be discussed &quot; in their interdependence &quot;, i.e., simultaneously. Thissuggests that the Soviet Government have lost interest in the possibility of a ban
for its own sake or as a necessary precondition for a wider agreement. the explanation is probably complex. Mr. Khrushchev spoke on 21st June of newSoviet nuclear devices which he said need practical testing. He may think thatthe price in terms of control is too heavy for the gain involved in formalising ade facto ban. He may well also believe that the Chinese are not going to be deterred from making and testing their own nuclear weapons, whatever the Soviet Unionmay agree to. He has therefore sidetracked the negotiations in Geneva, and is trying to merge them into the general problem of disarmament, on which his public positionis better, and the risk (from the point of view of his relations with the Chinese) of asolution to which he would have to subscribe more remote. If the United Statesresponds by resuming testing, he will gladly do the same, of course proclaiming thathis hand has been forced.Laos24. Laos was the only subject on which President Kennedy was able to deriveany comfort from his meeting with Mr. Khrushchev at Vienna, though this has notbeen borne out by subsequent events. Since then, Mr. Khrushchev has reiteratedthat he too wants an independent and neutral Laos. With the Berlin problemcoming to the boil, Laos cannot be occupying much of his attention. It will be enough for him if he can keep things moving in the same general direction as atpresent, i.e.(a) Giving us enough encouragement to deter the United States or South-east asia Treaty Organisation from intervening.(b) Keeping the cards in his own hands so far as possible to discourage any independent intervention by China.(c) Working for a settlement at Geneva which would remove the United states military presence from Laos, but erect no serious obstacles to the absorption of the country into the Sino-Soviet bloc at a convenient time.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.
ANNEX BSOVIET MEMORANDUM ON ENDING NUCLEAR WEAPON TESTSThe Soviet Government considers it necessary to present its considerationson the question of ending atomic and hydrogen weapon tests. It is known that negotiations between representatives of the USSR, the United States and GreatBritain at Geneva have been going on for more than two and a half years. However,there are still great difficulties in the road to the conclusion of an agreement.The Soviet Union has done and is continuing to do everything it can to cometo terms with the United States and Great Britain on a treaty to end nuclear weapontests. It is known that in order to remove obstacles to agreement it has madesubstantial concessions to the Western partners in the talks, having accepted anumber of proposals submitted by them.The position of the Soviet Government at the Geneva talks is simple and clear.The Soviet Union wants nuclear weapon tests of all kinds to be ended everywhereand for all time. But the Soviet Government cannot agree and will never agree tothe test-ban treaty becoming an empty scrap of paper which could be used as acover for further experiments with nuclear weapons for the purpose of improvingthem and developing new means of mass destruction. There can be no exemptionsfrom the treaty: all kinds of nuclear weapon tests must be banned in the air,underwater, underground and in outer space.In view of the present unsatisfactory position at the Geneva Conference, theSoviet Government should like to state once more its position on fundamental issues which remain unresolved to this day.Question of a MoratoriumIt is known that the Soviet Government agreed to the American proposal thatthe treaty should temporarily exclude from the ban underground tests of nuclear weapons below a definite threshold value. Now we must reach agreement on a moratorium on underground nuclear explosions temporarily not covered by thetreaty.It goes without saying that the agreement on a moratorium must be of such a nature that no State could violate it arbitrarily and resume test explosions of nuclear bombs. In view of this, the Soviet Government is firmly convinced thatthe expiration of the moratorium, an agreement on which would be reached by theparties concerned, should not absolve States of their commitment not to holdunderground nuclear explosions.Question of control the Soviet Union, just as the United States, considers that strict international control must be established over the cessation of the tests. However, it is quiteobvious that this control can be effective only if it rests on the mutual consent ofthe sides and not on the desire to take advantage of the control machinery toimpose the will of one group of States upon another group.The Soviet Government has examined all aspects of the question how tosafeguard equal rights of the sides in the implementation of control, and has drawnthe firm conclusion that the staffing of the control agencies must be based on equalrepresentation of the sides. It is precisely in conformity with this principle thatthe Soviet Union proposes that an understanding should be reached on the composition of the chief executive agency-the administrative council.The refusal to accept the proposal on instituting an administrative council ofthree equal representatives, one each from the principal groups of States thesocialist States, the countries belonging to Western military blocs, and theneutralist States is being justified by allegations that the Soviet Union seeks toobtain some special rights in the control organisation. This assertion, of course,has no foundation whatsoever.
What is the real meaning of the Soviet proposal? It is precisely to preclude the possibility of one side obtaining any special advantages or prejudicing thesecurity of one or another group of States. We want to safeguard, not formal, butreal equality of the sides while putting into effect the treaty on a ban on nuclearweapon tests.The control commission, on which all the principal groups of States will berepresented, can adopt sound, just decisions, taking into consideration the interestsof all States. However, it is not enough to take such decisions. It is imperative to guarantee their impartial implementation. Impartiality cannot be guaranteed ifthe implementation of the decisions is entrusted to one man alone.The history of contemporary international relations knows many instanceswhen one man, being under the influence of some grouping of States or acting for its benefit, has carried out already agreed decisions in an incorrect way. Ofcourse, this benefited only one group of States, whose interests this man furthered,but harmed other States. For it is well known that while there are neutral Statesthere are not nor can there be neutral men.Agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests directly affects the interestsof the safety of States, and the Government of the United States will undoubtedlyagree that maximum caution must be observed in solving this kind of problem. Inpresent conditions, when the world is divided into military blocs, when large armiesare maintained, when the threat of a nuclear conflict continues to hang over theworld, it is impermissible that questions affecting the interests of the security of states and the destinies of peoples should depend on the decisions of one man.Furthermore, the appointment of one man for implementing decisions adopted on control can be regarded as dictatorship, a desire to impose one&apos;s will. Indeed,it can hardly be expected that the Western Powers would consent to the appointmentof this man from some socialist country. They would rather suggest for this posta man from a neutral country.But is there any guarantee that such a man would take a neutral, impartialstand with regard to the socialist countries? We cannot agree to such an approach.The Soviet Union cannot tolerate dictatorship from any side. We want to haveequal conditions for all and we shall never consent to being placed in an unequalposition.We are confident that the Government of the United States subscribes to theopinion that any international agreement must contain guarantees precluding ill-intentioned and unjustified actions against a State, party to the agreement. Thisis the inalienable and lawful right of each State, each Government. In proposing that a collegial executive body of representatives of the three groups of states should be instituted, the Soviet Union proceeds from the desire to guarantee tothe States the implementation of precisely this right.Objecting to the Soviet proposal on the composition of the administrativecouncil, the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom at the geneva Conference have alleged that it is tantamount to establishing a right of&quot; veto &quot; with regard to inspections. But such allegations cannot be assessed in anyother way than as a continuation of the old line of distorting the position of theUSSR on control questions.One might recall in this connexion that the Soviet Government, as early asMay 1959 explaining its proposal on the establishment of quotas of inspections,emphasised that on-the-spot inspections within the limit of the agreed quotas mustbe effected at the request of the side interested in the inspection without any voting in the control commission or any other agency.All that is needed are objective readings of instruments at control postsindicating that a phenomenon has taken place in some part of a given country which might be suspected of being a nuclear explosion. If there is such an objectivereading, the Soviet proposal envisages that neither the control commission nor anyother body of the control organisation can interfere with the satisfaction of thedemand of the side for an inspection. &apos; Hence, no obstacles to inspection, to whichthe United States representatives refer in speaking of the so-called &quot; veto &quot;, canbe created by the administrative council.Of course, there are other questions too, and many of them are bound to arise in the course of carrying out the treaty on the discontinuance of nuclear weapontests, on which the executive agency will have to take decisions. A situation cannotbe tolerated in which unilateral decisions would be taken and conditions for
arbitrariness created. The danger of arbitrariness increases several times over ifthere is a single administrator. The possibility of arbitrariness and unilateraldecisions is completely precluded if the structure of the executive agency proposedby the Soviet Government is adopted. It follows that the question of a &quot; veto &quot; isartificially conceived.The Soviet Government is convinced that the adoption of the Soviet Union&apos;proposal on the composition of the administrative council would remove one ofthe big obstacles to agreement on the treaty.There is still another question on which there are divergencies. This is thequestion of the size of the quota of inspections. The Soviet Government hopes that the Government of the United States will also adopt a realistic approach tothe question of the number of on-the-spot inspections. Our proposal for threeinspections a year each on the territory of the USSR, the United States and theUnited Kingdom provides quite adequate guarantees against violations of thetreaty on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests.The demand for an excessive number of inspections, on which the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom insist, cannot but suggest the idea that in this caseconcern is by no means being shown for the establishment of effective control.In assessing the position of States on questions of inspection, one cannot, ofcourse, disregard the circumstance that while there are military groupings of states in the world, inspections can be used for intelligence purposes.Such is the position with regard to the talks on the cessation of nuclear tests.We have set forth with the utmost frankness our considerations on the waysto overcome the difficulties that have arisen. Our approach provides a soundfoundation for the conclusion in the near future of a treaty on the discontinuance of nuclear weapon tests.At the same time, objectively assessing the situation existing around theproblem of banning nuclear tests, one should, evidently, acknowledge that it appearsthat the parties to the Geneva talks now find it difficult to agree on the cessation of nuclear tests.Would it then not be better for our countries to take up the main, cardinalquestion the question of general and complete disarmament? In this Connexionwe welcome President Kennedy&apos;s statement in his latest message to Congress to theeffect that the conclusion of a treaty on an effective ban on nuclear tests wouldbe the first major step towards disarmament. Indeed, let us solve both problems in their interdependence, then the main obstacle will be eliminated which theWestern Powers now see in the Soviet proposal for setting up a three-memberadministrative council.The Soviet Government, as is well known, has already more than onceemphasised that the Soviet Government, for its part, is willing unconditionally toaccept any Western control proposals, if the Western Powers accept the proposalfor general and complete disarmament.The Soviet Government reaffirms its readiness and in that case agrees to signa document which will include the Western proposals on the cessation of nuclear tests.We can take this step because the question of the security of States would beon a different level in conditions of general and complete disarmament: therewould be no armies, nor would there be threats of attack by one State on another.When all States disarm and have no means of attack on other countries, thenconditions will indeed be created under which each country will have properguarantees of its security. No State will have the possibility of secretly setting uparmed forces which will threaten any other State or group of States. In theseconditions we are ready to accept any control proposed by the Western Powers.Now, when an arms race is under way in the world and antagonistic militarygroupings exist, we must preserve our armed forces in the interests of the securityof our country and our allies. If the armed forces of States are maintained, no control can be separated from intelligence. Control will not be associated withintelligence only when armed forces are abolished and armaments destroyed.Then, indeed, universal control will be necessary to see to it that no State or group of States could secretly manufacture arms or arm themselves to prepare aggression against other States. Strict and effective control against the arming of Statescannot be avoided.
At the same time it must be acknowledged that in present conditions control is by no means a guarantee against some country attacking another, because armsand armed forces are not only being maintained but also strengthened, strengthenedespecially in the field of nuclear weapons, which the United States President hashimself admitted. Cessation of nuclear weapon tests does not mean discontinuance of their manufacture and stockpiling, and the risk of war is not reduced. In theseconditions, each State has the right to suspect that intelligence agencies might beset up on the plea of control.If general and complete disarmament is effected, the States will maintain onlyagreed, restricted contingents of militia or police necessary for maintaining internal order and protecting the personal safety of citizens. These forces cannot create a threat of attack on other countries.In the case of necessity these contingents can be used by the Security Councilif some State nevertheless takes aggressive actions. Of course, all main groups of states must be equally represented in the leadership of such international forces,i.e., it must be really an international leadership.The Soviet Government is profoundly convinced that in our time the mostrealistic way of solving the disarmament problem is general and complete disarmament under effective international control. This has been acknowledgedby the majority of the world&apos;s States, as is borne out both by the resolution ofthe 14th Session of the General Assembly and the discussion of disarmamentproblems at the 15th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.The Soviet Government expresses the hope that the Government of the UnitedStates will take into consideration the ideas set forth in this memorandum and, forits part, will facilitate a solution of the problem of general and complete disarmament, including the tasks of discontinuing for good all nuclear weapontests.
ANNEX CSOVIET MEMORANDUM ON PEACE TREATY WITH GERMANY and settlement OF WEST BERLIN QUESTION1. The peace settlement with Germany, dragged out for many years, has largelypredetermined the dangerous development of events in Europe in the post-war period. Very important Allied decisions on rooting out militarism in Germany,which the Governments of the United States and the USSR regarded at the time as a &quot; guarantee of lasting peace &quot;, were implemented only in part and are nowvirtually not observed on the greater part of German territory. Of the Governmentsof the two German States that have taken shape since the war, only the Governmentof the German Democratic Republic recognises these agreements and adheres tothem. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany openly expresses itsnegative attitude to them, fosters sabre-rattling militarism and comes out in favourof revision of the German frontiers, revision of the results of the Second World War.It seeks to build up a strong military base for its aggressive plans, to foster a dangerous hotbed of conflicts on German soil and to set at loggerheads the formerallies in the anti-nazi coalition.The Western Powers permitted the Federal Republic of Germany to set aboutstockpiling weapons and building up an army obviously exceeding defence requirements. Other dangerous steps by the NIATO Powers were their permission for the Federal Republic of Germany to build warships with a displacement of upto 6,000 tons, and also to use British, French and Italian territory for military bases of the Federal Republic of Germany.2. The Soviet Government sincerely strives for the elimination of the causesengendering tension between the USSR and the United States and for a change-overto constructive friendly co-operation. The conclusion of a German peace treaty would bring both countries much closer to this aim.The USSR and the United States fought shoulder to shoulder against naziGermany.It is their common duty to conclude a German peace treaty and thus create a firm guarantee that forces which could plunge the world into another still moredevastating war will never rise on German soil. If the Soviet Union&apos;s desire tostrengthen peace and to prevent the unleashing of another world war in Europedoes not differ from the intentions of the United States Government it will not bedifficult to reach agreement.3. Proceeding on the basis of a realistic assessment of the situation, the SovietGovernment advocates the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.The question of a peace treaty is a question of the national security of the USSRand many other States. It is no longer possible to leave the situation in germany without changes. All conditions for the conclusion of a peace treaty have longsince matured and such a treaty must be concluded. The essence of the matter isby whom and how it will be concluded and whether there will be unnecessary delaysinvolved.4. The Soviet Government does not aim at prejudicing the interests of theUnited States or other Powers in Europe. It does not propose any changes inGermany or in West Berlin which would benefit only one State or one group of states. The USSR considers it necessary for the sake of strengthening peace to record the situation that took shape in Europe after the war, to formulate and consolidate de jure the immutability of the existing German frontiers and tonormalise the situation in West Berlin on the basis of reasonable consideration forthe interests of all sides.For the sake of reaching agreement on a peace treaty the Soviet Union doesnot insist on the immediate withdrawal of the Federal Republic of Germany fromNATO. After the conclusion of a peace treaty both German States could for acertain period remain members of those military groupings to which they now belong.
The Soviet proposal does not tie up the conclusion of the peace treaty withrecognition of the German Democratic Republic or the Federal Republic ofGermany by all parties to this treaty. To recognise or not to recognise this or that state is a matter for each Government.If the United States is not ready to sign a single peace treaty with both GermanStates, a peace settlement could be effected on the basis of two treaties. In this case the member States of the anti-nazi coalition would sign a peace treaty with both or with one German State at their discretion. These treaties need not haveidentical texts but they must contain the same provisions on the major questionsof a peace settlement.5. The conclusion of a German peace treaty would also solve the problem ofnormalising the situation in West Berlin. West Berlin, deprived of a firminternational status, is now a place where Bonn&apos;s revenge-seeking elements constantlymaintain extreme tension and stage all kinds of provocations very dangerous tothe cause of peace. We must prevent a development under which the strengthening of West German militarism might lead to irreparable consequences due to theunsettled situation in West Berlin.At present the Soviet Government sees no better solution to the problem of west Berlin than its conversion into a de-militarised free city. The implementation of the proposal for a free city would normalise the situation in West Berlin, takingdue account of the interests of all sides. The occupation regime preserved therehas long since outlived its day; it has lost any connexion with the aims for the sake of which it was created, and with the Allied agreements on Germany on the basisof which it has existed.The occupation rights, of course, would discontinue with the conclusion of aGerman peace treaty, no matter whether it were signed with both German states or only with the German Democratic Republic, inside whose territory west berlin lies.The Soviet Government advocates that the free city of West Berlin should freelyeffect its communications with the outside world and that its domestic system should be determined by the free expression of the will of its population. Ofcourse, the United States, like all other countries, would have every opportunityto maintain and develop its relations with the free city. In general, West Berlin, asthe Soviet Government sees it, must be strictly neutral. It must not be tolerated,of course, that West Berlin should be further used as a base for provocative hostileactivity against the USSR, the German Democratic Republic or any other Stateand continue to remain a dangerous centre of tension and international conflicts.The USSR proposes that the most reliable guarantees should be establishedagainst intervention in the affairs of the free city by any State. As a guarantor ofthe free city, token contingents of troops of the United States, the United Kingdom,France and the Soviet Union could be stationed in West Berlin. Nor would theUSSR object to the stationing in West Berlin of troops of neutral countries under united Nations auspices for the same purpose. The status of the free city couldbe appropriately registered at the United Nations and sealed with the authority ofthat international organisation. The Soviet side agrees to discuss any other measures which could guarantee the freedom and independence of West Berlinas a free demilitarised city.The West Berlin settlement must, of course, take into consideration in everyway the necessity for respect for, and strict observance of, the sovereign rights ofthe German Democratic Republic, which is known to have expressed its readiness to adhere to an appropriate agreement and to respect it.6. The Soviet Government proposes that a peace conference be called already at the present time without any delay, a German treaty concluded and the questionof West Berlin as a free city settled on this basis. If, for one reason or another, theGovernments of the United States and other Western Powers are at present notyet ready for this, an interim solution could be adopted for a definite period.The four Powers will urge the German States to agree in any way acceptable to them on the questions pertaining to a peace settlement with Germany andreunification. The four Powers will declare in advance that they will recognise any agreement which the Germans may reach.In the event of a positive outcome to the talks between the German democratic republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, a single peace treaty would then
be agreed and signed. If the German States are not able to agree on theaforementioned questions, measures will be taken for the conclusion of a peace treaty with both German States or with one of them at the discretion of thecountries concerned.In order not to drag out the peace settlement it is necessary to establish deadlineswithin which the Germans must explore the possibilities of agreements on questionsfalling within their internal competence. The Soviet Government regards a period not exceeding six months as adequate for such talks. This period is fully adequate for contact between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Democratic republic of Germany and for talks between them, since in the 16 years since the warunderstanding has matured of the necessity for liquidating the remnants of theSecond World War in Europe.7. The Soviet Government is ready to examine any constructive proposals by the United States Government on a German peace treaty and the normalisationof the situation in West Berlin. The Soviet Government will show the maximum of good will in order to solve the problem of a German peace treaty by mutual agreement between the USSR, the United States and other States concerned. the signing of a German peace treaty by all parties to the anti-nazi coalition and asettlement on this basis of the question of the neutral status of West Berlin would create the best conditions for confidence between States and the solution of suchmajor international problems as disarmament and others. If the United Statesdoes not show an understanding of the necessity for concluding a peace treaty, weshall regret this, since we would have to sign a peace treaty, which it would beimpossible and dangerous to delay further, not with all States, but only with those that want to sign it.The peace treaty will specifically record the status of West Berlin as a free city,and the Soviet Union, like the other parties to the treaty, will, of course, strictlyobserve it and measures will also be taken to see to it that this status is also respectedby the other countries. At the same time this will also mean the liquidation of theoccupation regime in West Berlin with all the consequences arising from this. Inparticular, the questions of using land, water and air communications across theterritory of the German Democratic Republic will have to be settled not otherwise than through appropriate agreements with the German Democratic Republic.This is only natural, since control over such communications is an inalienable rightof any sovereign State.8. The conclusion of the German treaty will be a major step towards a finalpost-war settlement in Europe which the Soviet Union has invariably beenstriving for.* * * * * *The Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, M.

ANNEX DMR. KHRUSHCHEVS TELEVISION SPEECH IN MOSCOW ON 15TH JUNEDear Comrades, Friends, as you know, I recently returned from Vienna wherefor two days I met and had comprehensive talks with John F. Kennedy, thePresident of the United States.Much has been published in our Press, and also in the entire world Press,on this subject. Many of you have already read the memorandums which were handed to President Kennedy. The first memorandum dealt with the questionof ending nuclear weapon tests, and the other with the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and a solution of the West Berlin problem on that basis.Obviously many of you have also read President Kennedy&apos;s radio and television speech which was published in full in our newspapers. Thus, Sovietpublic opinion is well informed about the views which the United States Presidentexpounded and his appraisal of our meeting.To-day I should like to express some thoughts, some considerations of my own about the meeting and talks with President Kennedy in Vienna.As you already know, this meeting was preceded by an exchange of viewsthrough diplomatic channels and also by an exchange of messages between thePresident of the United States and myself. We agreed on such a meeting as tookplace in Vienna on June 3 and 4. This meeting was a good opportunity for thefirst personal contact and exchange of views on basic problems between myself,as Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, and the new President of theUnited States.On the way to Vienna we spent a few days with our Czechoslovak friends and, of course, had very thorough talks with Comrade Antonin Novotny, Presidentof the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and first secretary of the CommunistParty of Czechoslovakia, and other Czechoslovak leaders.I have had occasion to visit fraternal Czechoslovakia several times and I have always been conscious there of an exceptionally warm and cordial attitude. Thatwas also the case on this occasion. We were welcomed everywhere as dearfriends, as brothers, linked by a community of vital interests and aims.I avail myself of the opportunity to thank once again the Government ofthe Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and all our dear friends, Czechs and Slovaks,who gave us such a cordial and hospitable welcome during our stay in theirwonderful country, which is confidently advancing along the road of buildingcommunism.This is how things are in the relations between our socialist countries thegreat common cause of building a new, socialist world has created a bond ofkinship between us, has united us in one closely knit family. In upholding anddefending the interests of their peoples, the leaders of our countries are at thesame time upholding and defending the interests of all the peoples of the socialistcountries, the great cause of socialism and lasting peace on earth.In going to Vienna for our meeting with the President of the United States,we, of course, considered in the first place how this meeting would affect, notonly the relations between our two countries, but also the relations between thecountries of the new socialist world and the capitalist countries.We consider that such meetings are indispensable because, in presentconditions, questions which defy solution through conventional diplomatic channels insistently require meetings between Heads of Government.Such meetings are indispensable, on condition, of course, that these Headsof Government strive towards safeguarding peace between States. For our part,we are doing everything in our power to ease international tension and solve the major problems in the relations between States.Before taking up specific questions which were discussed in my talks withthe President of the United States, I should like to thank cordially the FederalPresident of Austria, Dr. Scharf, Federal Chancellor Dr. Gorbach, and Vice-Chancellor Dr. Pittermann for all they did to ensure that the Vienna meetingtook place in most favourable conditions for both sides, and we are grateful to the
citizens of beautiful Vienna for their kind and cordial attitude towards us,representatives of the Soviet Union.And now, dear comrades, allow me to state our point of view on questionsdiscussed between myself and President Kennedy. I should like to state someconsiderations as to what, in our opinion, is the best way of solving those disputedor outstanding problems in the relations between States problems which have become ripe for settlement or even over-ripe, and which insistently call for asolution.One of those fundamental, paramount questions is that of general and complete disarmament.It is well known that the Soviet Union has been working persistently andsteadily for a solution of the disarmament problem. For decades the Soviet state has been raising this problem before the entire world.It will be recalled that as long ago as 1922, at the Genoa Conference, theSoviet Union, on the initiative of the great Lenin, proposed general and complete disarmament. In 1927 we raised this question before the League of Nations.At that time we were not able to ensure the solution of this problem and theimperialists subsequently started a world war.Since the Second World War, which brought so much suffering and suchdisasters to the peoples, we have redoubled our efforts for a solution of thedisarmament problem at the earliest possible moment. Both within the united nations and outside it we miss no opportunity for pressing for a positive solutionof the disarmament problem and removing the danger of a new world war.The Soviet Union has taken part in the work of the United Nations atomic energy Commission which has been entrusted with the task of working out anagreement to ban nuclear weapons.We have also conducted negotiations with the Commission on ConventionalArmaments. Starting with 1950, when the Joint Disarmament Commission was set up, the Soviet Union took an active part in its work. For four years our representatives sat on the sub-committee of this Commission in London and new york. Many were the proposals submitted, many were the speeches heard, withouta single step forward being taken towards the solution of the disarmament problem.A Ten-Power Disarmament Committee met in Geneva last year, this timecomposed differently from the bodies that preceded it. Represented on it werefive socialist and five Western States. However, this committee likewise failedto achieve any positive results in view of the unwillingness of the Western Powersto accept disarmament.It is said that if the mounds of paper written on at the commissions and sub-committees on disarmament had been dumped into Lake Geneva, it wouldhave overflowed its shores. A lot of paper has been wasted without even comingnear to a realistic solution of the disarmament problem.The question is, why is it that all these commissions and sub-committees have failed to achieve any success? For the simple reason that the Western powers were plainly not prepared for serious negotiations, did not want and, to be frank,do not want disarmament to this day. It is clear that no Government can afford to appear openly before the peoples with such an attitude! The Western powers are afraid to tell public opinion directly and squarely that they do not want tonegotiate disarmament with the Soviet Union in a businesslike way.The capitalist monopolies are making big profits out of the arms race andhave a stake in it continuing. But in order to conceal all this, they, it seems,need at least a pretence at negotiations. And so they have chosen the diplomaticapproach: without refusing to negotiate outright, at the same time they do not accept concrete proposals on disarmament.They keep dragging their feet, as the saying goes. A whole system has been worked out for preventing the objective from being reached, for definitely leadingdisarmament to a dead end.The proposals on general and complete disarmament which, on theinstructions of the Soviet Government, I submitted to the United Nations general assembly for consideration constitute a good basis for the solution of thedisarmament problem. These proposals of ours, if accepted, would forever relieve the peoples of the grave burden of the arms race and of the threat of a nuclear-rocket war of extermination.
We said then, and I emphatically repeat it now, that if the Western Powersagree to general and complete disarmament, the Soviet Union is ready to accept any system of control they may conceive.But in spite of this, the Western Powers claim that it is the attitude of theSoviet Union on control that is hindering agreement on disarmament and that theycannot come to terms with us on these questions.I repeat once again: the Soviet Union stands for strict and effectiveinternational control. We are prepared to accept your proposals on control, Mr.President of the United States, provided you accept our proposals on general and complete disarmament. And then there will be no deadlock in the disarmamenttalks.We want honest disarmament: we want to ensure equal terms for all nationsduring disarmament, so that no one may ever take advantage of disarmament to gain benefits for himself, to the detriment of the security of other nations. our proposals envisage strict control at every phase in the implementation of thedisarmament agreement. We consider that if complete disarmament is carriedout, the most thorough control will be needed. Control agencies should have access everywhere without the so-called veto, without any bans, without any restrictions. Access should be open at any time and to any place, and we areprepared to provide this to the control agencies.Only on the condition of general and complete disarmament with the strictestcontrol is it possible to achieve trust and create real conditions for the peaceful co-existence of States in which no country or group of countries could armsecretly for the purpose of attacking other countries.That is our point of view. What clearer statement need be made to preventthe Western representatives from reiterating that the Soviet Union does not acceptcontrol!All the fabrications to the effect that the Soviet Union does not want controlshow only one thing-how freely the people are deceived in the so-called &quot; free world &quot;. Our world, the world of the socialist countries, is, however, excellentlyinformed and knows that we stand for effective control. But in the &quot; free world &quot;,with its &quot; freedom of information &quot;, they are free to dupe society, to reiteratedefinitely false contentions in order to mislead people.Talks between the USSR and the United States on problems of disarmamentwill begin in Washington on June 19. I should like to believe that on this occasion,at last, we shall meet with a constructive approach on the part of the United States.Now I should like to dwell on another question on which we exchangedopinions with President Kennedy the question of the talks on banning tests of nuclear weapons.For nearly three years we have been negotiating with the United States and Britain on this question. At the very outset of the discussions we submitted adraft treaty to the Western Powers for their consideration. Although this draftmeets the interests of all those taking part in the talks and although during thenegotiations we have met half way a number of the wishes expressed by theWestern Powers,.the talks have failed to produce any concrete results.Now new difficulties have arisen. The Western Powers resolutely refuse toaccept our proposal on the forms of control.What is the essence of our proposal? Allow me to state it briefly. At firstwe thought it possible to accept the proposal of the Western Powers that theexecutive body of the system controlling the observance of the test ban shouldbe headed by one man, appointed by agreement between the sides. But the events in the Congo made us wary and taught us, it might be said, a lesson. TheGovernment of the Republic of the Congo appealed to the United Nations forassistance in the struggle against the Belgian colonialists who were seeking to restore their colonial domination over that country. The Security Council andthe General Assembly passed a number of good resolutions in this connexion.But what happened after that?Mr. Hammarskjold, who poses as a neutral person, taking advantage of hisposition as Secretary-General of the United Nations, interpreted and inplementedthese decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly in such a way as to please the colonialists. Is this not attested to by the foul assassination ofthe Prime Minister of the Congo Republic, Patrice Lumumba the head of the
very same Government which requested assistance from the armed forces of theUnited Nations against the outrages of the colonialists?The tragedy of the Congolese people has clearly shown the consequences which may result from arbitrary actions of the executive body of the united nations in the person of a single Secretary-General. We must do our utmost toprevent a repetition of such actions. That is what the interests of the peoples, theinterests of the preservation of peace demand.Precisely because of that the Soviet Government has arrived at the firmconviction that control over the observance of a nuclear weapon test-ban treatymust be exercised with the participation of representatives of the three existinggroups of States the socialist countries, the member countries of Western militarygroupings, and States following a neutral policy and at that, the representativesof these three groups of States may adopt only agreed decisions.The Soviet Union has never demanded, nor does it demand, any special statusfor itself. We do not seek to dominate the control commission, but neither shallwe allow anyone to dominate us. We demand for ourselves precisely the same rights as the other parties to the treaty will have. What we want is that thereshould be no abuses on the part of the control organisation.And what do the Western Powers want? They want to impose upon us a&quot; neutral&quot; person of some kind as the sole interpreter and executor of the treaty.In other words, they want to foist upon us in this post some new Hammarskjold,so that he would supervise control over all the territory of our country. Franklyspeaking, they want such a man to allow them to conduct espionage within ourterritory in the interests of the West. To this, of course, we cannot agree and will never agree, because this concerns the security of our country.It is clear to everyone, of course, that the ending of nuclear weapon testswould not be enough to prevent a nuclear-rocket war. We can ban nuclear weapontests, but the existing stocks would remain, the production of these arms could continue and, consequently, the stockpiling of them would go on. Thus thedanger of a nuclear-rocket war would keep mounting. It is quite obvious thatthe ending of nuclear weapon tests alone would not be some kind of a dam tobar the way to the arms race.Judging by everything, it is difficult to reach agreement on the ending of nuclear weapon tests at the Geneva talks due to the position taken by the western powers.The main thing at present is to solve without delay the problem of generaland complete disarmament. We told the United States President: Let us solveboth problems jointly the problem of tests and the problem of general and complete disarmament. Then it will be easier to reach agreement on the settingup of an executive control body.In conditions of general and complete disarmament the question ofinternational security will appear in a new light: there will be no armies and no danger of one State attacking another. Under these conditions the SovietGovernment will be ready to accept the Western Powers&apos; control proposals.We shall agree that provisions should be made for a control system withoutany restrictions by any side whatsoever, including the country in whose territoryit is carried out. This will remove any danger of control being used for spyingagainst some State. And this is perfectly logical, because if there are no armies,no arms race, States will have no military secrets, and then the Westernrepresentatives will be able to enter any door, any plant or institute in our country,just as our representatives will in their countries.In assessing the possibilities of an agreement to end nuclear weapon tests in conditions when there is no agreement on general and complete disarmament,we must not ignore this important circumstance either:At a time when negotiations to end nuclear tests are under way between thethree Powers the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain France isstaging tests in defiance of the protests of world public opinion and governments and ignoring repeated decisions passed by the United Nations, decisions urgingStates to refrain from such tests.Thus a peculiar situation exists: while we seek agreement with the western powers in Geneva, an ally of these Powers France continues testing nucleararms and declares that the Geneva talks do not put her under any obligation.
Consequently, France, a member of NATO that aggressive military bloc whichdoes not conceal that it is directed against the Soviet Union is able to perfectnuclear weapons in the interests of her Western Allies.Moreover, we must reckon with the fact that France&apos;s example may befollowed by other countries, when they have the appropriate scientific and technicalprerequisites.Of course, we understand the peculiar logics of the Western Powers, which,apparently, have no confidence in their allies in military blocs and wish to ensuretheir independence by relying on their own nuclear weapons. The President ofFrance, General de Gaulle, says, for instance, that he wants to have his own nucleararms so as to enable France to conduct an independent policy.But other countries ensnared in the Western blocs may state that they do not want to place reliance on the nuclear test-ban treaty in conditions when the Statespossessing nuclear weapons will retain them after the signing of such an agreement.Obviously, they can also repeat the arguments now used by France in order tojustify the holding of tests, can strive to develop their own nuclear weapons andjoin the so-called &quot; nuclear club.&quot;These, of course, are logics injurious to the cause of peace. They can be used and are already being employed by those circles in the West which do not want to renounce nuclear arms, continuing to bank on these weapons of massannihilation.All this brings us to the conclusion that we must link the solution of theproblem of ending nuclear weapon tests with the problem of general and complete disarmament.   In the existing conditions, it seems, no other way out can be found.In the course of the exchange of views with the President, we set forth indetail our viewpoint concerning the interdependence of the solution of the problemof general and complete disarmament and the ending of nuclear weapon tests.We should like the United States Government to understand our views correctly.This would help to find a basis for agreement.The peoples expect the Governments to expedite the solution of the problemof general and complete disarmament in order to safeguard peace. This is whyentire world public opinion raises its voice demanding that the Governments which do not show interest in the solution of this problem should stop sabotaging anddragging out the talks. It is high time to take the disarmament problem out ofthe labyrinth of empty talk, where it has remained for many years already.Permit me to turn now to the German question, which occupied an importantplace in our talks with President Kennedy.The Soviet Government has repeatedly stated its position on this question.And the Western Powers cannot complain that they have an insufficient knowledgeof our proposals. We have done and are doing everything to convince theGovernments of Britain, the United States, France, and other States which took part together with us in the war against Hitler Germany that the absence of a peace treaty with Germany has created a profoundly abnormal and dangerous situationin Europe.It has always been recognised that peace treaties should be concluded afterthe end of wars between States. This has already become a custom and, if youwish, a standard of international law. Instances of this can also be found in international practice after the end of the Second World War. Peace treaties with Italy and the other States that fought on the side of Hitler Germany weresigned more than 14 years ago. The United States, Britain and the other countriesconcluded a peace treaty with Japan in 1951. But the Governments of theselfsame countries won&apos;t hear of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany!Can such a situation continue in the future? After all, the peoples of Europeare vitally interested in the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. It has beenlong awaited by the peoples of Poland, Czechoslovakia and all the other Statesbordering on Germany. This treaty is essential to both German States: theGerman Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.The population of these countries live in hope that a line will be drawn, atlong last, under the Second World War and the German people will maintainrelations with neighbouring States on the basis of mutual confidence.The question seems to be clear. A peace treaty with Germany is indispensable.Moreover, of course, there can be no question of any new changes of frontiers.
We proceed from the premise that the peace treaty with Germany will put a sealon what has already been established by the Potsdam Agreement. The Governmentof the German Democratic Republic has repeatedly stated that it recognises asfinal the eastern frontier of Germany along the Oder-Neisse line, established bythis agreement, and regards it as a frontier of peace between the German and thePolish peoples.Indeed, the Governments of the Western Powers obviously understand, too,how senseless it would be to raise now the question of revising Germany&apos;s frontiers.Their representatives have often told us this during our conversations.The President of France, General de Gaulle, for instance, has publicly statedthat the German people &quot; must not question the present frontiers in the west, east,north and south.&quot; Even Chancellor Adenauer, that champion of the cold war and specialist in stirring up passions among States, has come out with a statement to the effect that the Federal Republic of Germany does not strive to alter the frontiers through war, through the use of force.Then why not sign the peace treaty, if everyone realises clearly that the presentfrontiers of Germany cannot be altered without war, and that war, as the western governments declare, is not wanted by them?A simple operation, it would seem to put a seal on what actually existsalready and what has long been demanded by the peoples! What is it then thatkeeps the Western Governments from this step?The reason obviously lies in the fact that certain people pay lip-service to peace while actually wishing to keep alive the smouldering embers of the second world War, so as to choose a suitable moment to kindle the conflagration of a newwar. For this purpose more and more new divisions are being formed in western germany and Chancellor Adenauer is demanding atomic weapons for his army.What is the purpose of all this? After all, neither a big army nor atomic weapons are needed to retain what Western Germany possesses to-day. However,there are forces there which still covet what does not belong to them and whichcannot resign themselves to the existing frontiers. What would an attempt to change the frontiers at present mean? It would mean war, and a thermonuclearwar at that.This is why the position of the enemies of a peace settlement with Germanycannot fail to put the peoples on their guard. They have the right to say: If youare for peace, prove this by deeds sign a peace treaty and pursue a policy inconformity with it.In his conversations with me, President Kennedy and as a matter of fact,other Western representatives too referred to the fact that the Western powers have some kind of obligations to the residents of West Berlin and that these obligations cannot be affected even by the conclusion of a German peace treaty.It is natural to ask, however, what obligations they feel must be maintainedif all of them follow from the surrender of Hitler Germany and from the provisionalAllied agreements and, consequently, can be valid only until the peace treaty issigned? What is more, there are in general no special Allied commitments withregard to West Berlin.The Allied obligations applied to the entire territory of Germany and it wasprecisely these agreements that were grossly violated by the Western Powers. Theyturned Western Germany into a militarist State, founded a military bloc directed against us, and in this bloc Federal Germany plays a primary part. The generalswho commanded Hitler&apos;s troops, who committed atrocities in the Soviet Union,Poland, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Yugoslavia, France, Greece, Belgium, norway and other countries now hold a commanding position in NATO.It has always been the case that after the signing of a peace treaty the conditionsof surrender lose their force on the entire territory which the treaty covers, and throughout this territory the occupation terms are lifted.Consequently West Berlin, which is situated on the territory of the german democratic Republic, will after the signing of the peace treaty be free of all theconditions established as a result of the surrender of Hitler Germany and theintroduction of the occupation regime there.It should be said that when the question of a peace treaty with Germany, andconsequently of the normalisation of the situation in West Berlin, arises therepresentatives of the Western Powers in many cases depart from legal grounds
and start appealing to questions of prestige. ,But these attempts are beneathcriticism.   I should like to mention a fairly recent case.We fought together with the United States against Japan. Our peoples shedtheir blood together. The Soviet army routed the main nucleus of the Japanesearmy the Kwantung army in Manchuria. The Soviet Union together with theother countries that fought against Japan, took part in drafting the measures for controlling Japan&apos;s post-war development. A Far Eastern Commission was setup in Washington and also an Allied Council for Japan with headquarters in Tokyo.In these bodies Soviet representatives took a most active part on an equal footing.Then it came to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. Our allies disregardedthe views of the Soviet Union and signed a separate peace treaty with Japan.I shall not dwell on the reasons which at that time determined the position ofthe Soviet Union on the question of a peace treaty with Japan, since now we arespeaking of a different matter of the way the United States treated its ally inthat case. It unilaterally abolished the Allied Council for Japan and deprivedthe Soviet representatives of all rights. Our representatives were left virtually in mid-air they were being pushed out of Tokyo by every means, yet we had certainrights and obligations which stemmed from the surrender of Japan and werestipulated in the corresponding agreements.So you see that at that time the Americans disregarded both the rights of theSoviet Union and the international agreements. Relying on its superiority inatomic weapons, it sought to dictate conditions not only to conquered Japan butalso to its allies in the war against Japan.More than two years ago we published our draft of a peace treaty withGermany. It contains nothing detrimental to the interests of our former allies,or, incidentally, to the Germans themselves.The Soviet Union, which suffered greater losses than all the rest of the allies in the anti-Hitler coalition taken together, proposes the conclusion of a peace treaty in order to normalise the situation in Europe, to normalise relations with bothGerman States. Meanwhile the United States, Britain and France, together withFederal Germany, do not want to sign a peace treaty; they seek to preserve anuncertain and dangerous situation. They refuse to eliminate the remnants of thelast war through the conclusion of a peace treaty and insist on retaining theoccupation regime and their troops in West Berlin.Every person, if not deprived of common sense, understands that the signing of a peace treaty is the way to improve relations between States. The refusal to sign a peace treaty and the perpetuation of the occupation regime in west berlin are directed at continuing the cold war, and who can say where the border-line lies between a cold war and a war in the full sense of the word? Surelyit is clear that a cold war is a period of preparation, of gathering forces for war?I speak of all this so that everyone should understand the gravity of the dangerincurred by any further delay in the conclusion of a German peace treaty.When we suggest signing a peace treaty with Germany and turning West Berlininto a free city we are accused of wanting to deprive the Western Powers of access to this city. But that is an incorrect and unworthy argument. Granting west berlin the status of a free city would mean that all countries of the world wishing to maintain economic and cultural ties with that city would have the right andpossibility to do so freely.Of course, agreement would have to be reached with the country across whoseterritory the communications pass that link West Berlin with the outside world.This is normal. Otherwise the sovereignty of the State inside which west berlin is situated would be jeopardised.The Governments of the Western Powers claim that they have pledgedthemselves to defend the freedom and well-being of the population of West Berlin.In the Four-Power Agreements on Berlin, however, nothing is said of these obligations of the United States, Britain and France.The idea of ensuring freedom for the population of West Berlin can in itselfarouse no objections from anyone. None other than the Soviet Union suggeststhat the political and social regime in West Berlin should be the one which its population wants.That means that no hand is lifted against the freedom of West Berlin, norare there any obstacles to access to the city.   We have repeated in the past and
we repeat again, a peace treaty will create all the necessary conditions for ensuring the liberty of the free city of West Berlin and its unhampered ties with the outside world. Naturally, in solving the problem of access to West Berlin it is essentialto abide by the generally-accepted international standards, that is, to use theterritory of the country through which the roads of access pass only by agreementwith its Government.Such a situation is recognised as normal by everyone. So why should it beconsidered abnormal to ask the consent of the German Democratic Republic topass through its territory to West Berlin? After all, the land routes to West Berlinpass through its territory, the waterways also run through its territory, and so,too, do the air routes.Consequently, after the conclusion of a peace treaty countries wishing tomaintain ties with West Berlin will have to reach agreement with the german democratic Republic on ways of access to West. Berlin and communications withthat city.We are not suggesting anything unusual. That is the way it has been in relations between equal States for hundreds of years, perhaps even many hundreds of years. We did not invent this, it exists not only de facto but also de jure, andhas long ago become the general rule.When the Soviet Government suggests concluding a peace treaty andnormalising on this basis the situation in West Berlin, it wants only peace, it wants to. remove from relations between States everything that causes friction and couldcause a dangerous conflict.It is not the socialist countries but the Western Powers that are throwingdown a challenge to the world, when, contrary to common sense, they declare that they will not recognise the conclusion of a peace treaty and will seek to preserve the occupation regime in West Berlin, which-if you please they conquered!That is not a policy of peace, it is trampling on the most elementary standards in relations between States, it is a desire to preserve a state of extreme tension in international relations, and moreover, it is a threat of war.The Soviet Union and our friends do not want war and we will not start awar. But we will defend our sovereignty, will fulfil our sacred duty to defendour freedom and independence. If any country violates peace and crosses the frontiers land, air or water of another that country will assume full responsibilityfor the consequences of the aggression and will receive a proper rebuff.The world Press has published many comments on our meetings and talks with President Kennedy. Among these comments there are many sensiblestatements made in the United States, in Britain, in France and in western germany not to mention the German Democratic Republic and the other socialistcountries.But there are also hate-ridden persons, deprived of common sense, who opposenegotiations with the Soviet Union and call for a crusade against communism.They are organising new provocations all the time. And it was by no meansaccidental that numerous gatherings of revenge-seekers, at which belligerentspeeches were made by Adenauer and other leaders of the Bonn Government, weretimed in Federal Germany to coincide with the Vienna meeting.The opponents of a normalisation of the international situation have nowlaunched another big provocation in West Berlin, where from the beginning of Junecommittees of the West German parliament have been meeting and where a sessionof the Bundesrat is scheduled for June 16, although West Berlin never has been andis not now a part of Federal Germany. Evidently in Western Germany itself ashortage of Lebensraum for provocation is being felt.To what lengths of folly persons blinded by their hatred for socialism can gois revealed by a statement of the Canadian-American inter-parliamentary grouppublished a few days ago. These parliamentarians howl like hyenas and threatennuclear war. They have not seen war on their territory. I do not know whetherthey have personally taken part in a war or not, but it is absolutely clear that theyhave no idea what a modern thermonuclear war is like, if they can try to push their countries, and others with them, into a conflict. To-day, any war, even if it beginsas a conventional, non-nuclear war, can develop into a devastating nuclear-rocketwar. The peoples should put straitjackets on the madmen who are pressing forwar.
The peoples of Europe know what war is. We have had to take part in- twoworld wars. Twenty years ago a war was forced on the Soviet people, the mostsanguinary and hard war in our history. The enemy reached the threshold of moscow, he reached the Volga and occupied and devastated a considerable partof Soviet territory. But the Soviet Union withstood the drive of the enemy andwon that war.   We went to Berlin and punished those who unleashed the war.We do not want another world war we want peace. The Soviet people have achieved good mutual understanding with the Germans of the German democratic republic. The best relations have developed between the Soviet Union and theGerman Democratic Republic, and the conviction has grown that we should befriends, not enemies, and that this friendship is beneficial and advantageous to both peoples. The Soviet people wish to have good relations also with theGermans of Western Germany.Our people want to be friends with the French. We fought together withthem against Hitler Germany, and each of us has learned from his own experiencewhat fascism means, what war means.We want friendship with the British, the Americans, the Norwegians and otherpeoples of the anti-Hitler coalition, together with whom we fought for peace onearth. We have no reason to quarrel with any people; we want to live in friendship and concord with all peoples.To that end the Soviet Union is proposing to sign, jointly with other countries,a peace treaty with Germany. And this peaceful step is called a threat or evenan act of aggression! Such talk can come only from those who seek to slanderus or distort our intentions, to poison the minds of the peoples with lies.We ask everyone to understand us correctly: the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany cannot be postponed any longer, a peace settlement in Europe mustbe attained this year.We call on all countries that fought against Germany to take part in thepeace conference when agreement is reached on convening it. The question thatremains now is not whether to sign a peace treaty or not, but whether the peace treaty will be signed with the two existing German States-the German democratic republic and the Federal Republic of Germany or with one of the German States,whether all countries that fought against Germany will take part in the peace settlement or only a part of them.The Governments of certain countries have announced in advance that theywill not take part in a peace conference. The Soviet Union will, of course, regretit if some countries evade signing a German peace treaty. We have always wantedand still want all countries of the anti-Hitler coalition to take part in the peaceful settlement of the German question.But even should certain countries refuse to take part in the negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty, this will not stop us, and together with othercountries which desire it, we shall sign a peace treaty with the two German States.Should Federal Germany not agree to sign a peace treaty, we shall sign it with theGerman Democratic Republic alone, which has long declared its desire to conclude a peace treaty and has agreed to the formation on her territory of a free city of west Berlin.There are some in the West who threaten us, saying that if we sign a peace treaty it will not be recognised and that even arms will he brought into play toprevent its implementation. Evidently they forget that times are different now.Even in the past the &quot; positions of strength &quot; policy was useless against the soviet union, but now it is more than ever doomed to&apos; failure.The Soviet Union is against the use of force in relations between States. west and for a peaceful settlement of controversial questions between States. However,we are capable of giving a proper rebuff to any use of force and we have what is needed to defend our interests.During the meetings in Vienna there was also an exchange of views on thesituation in Laos and on a peaceful settlement of the Laotian question.The communique says on this matter that the President of the United Statesand the Prime Minister of the USSR &quot; reaffirmed their support of a neutral and independent Laos under a Government chosen by the Laotians themselves, andof international agreements for ensuring that neutrality and independence, and inthis connexion they have recogised the importance of an effective cease-fire &quot;.
The Laotians are a peace-loving people. Having taken the road of independentdevelopment, that country threatened no one and was not a source of tension.That lasted until the imperialists decided to turn Laos into their militaryspringboard into a base for preparing aggression.An uprising was organised against the legitimate Government of PrinceSouvanna Phouma. The rebels received arms and military advisers from theUnited States. Peace in the country was disrupted, a war started a war which,because of outside interference, threatened to develop into a big conflagration.An extremely dangerous situation for peace developed in South-East Asia.Now the American side does not hide the fact that the responsibility for the dangerous events in Laos lies with the previous United States administration and that its policy in that part of the world was not always wise. In Marchof this year Mr. Kennedy stated that the Government he heads would seek to create a neutral and independent Laos. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned,we have stood in the past, and we stand to-day, for Laos being an independent and neutral State, not a tool in the hands of military blocs, and for no oneinterfering in the internal affairs of that country.Thus, before the meeting in Vienna there existed sufficient grounds for finding a basis for agreement on a peaceful settlement in Laos.During the discussions with President Kennedy on the Laotian question itappeared that our approach was similar.I declared that in order to settle this question it was essential to ensure theformation of an independent and neutral Laos. At the same time it was necessaryto make a clear distinction between external problems and internal ones. the domestic policy of Laos cannot and must not be determined either by the USSRor the United States, or by other countries. If any countries were to establishhow Laos should live and what government it should have, then it would notbe an independent neutral Laos, but a Laos governed from outside. And that isimpermissible. The three political forces acting in Laos must themselves forma government which will uphold the principles of independence and neutrality.The Soviet Union will welcome such a policy and will do everything in its power for it.I told President Kennedy all this. And it seemed to me that the Presidentreceived with understanding what I told him. He declared that our two countries should influence the corresponding political groupings in Laos in order to achieveagreement between them on the formation of a single government &apos;and its programme on the basis of recognition of independence and neutrality. Weconsider such an approach sensible.We are firmly convinced that no one should interfere in the internal affairs of Laos, because the interference of any one side could be fraught with very dangerous consequences. It is essential to approach the settlement of the Laotianproblem carefully and cautiously and not permit anything which might complicate the possibility of a peaceful settlement in Laos.In this connexion we drew attention to the fact that the use of American officersand military advisers in the rebel forces meant interference in internal affairs on the side of a definite political grouping. Such an approach is contrary torecognition of the policy of the neutrality of Laos and constitutes open interference in that country&apos;s domestic affairs. The sooner the American side renounces suchinterference the better. If the present policy of connivance with the rebelscontinues, then the course of events could lead to bad consequences.It is all the more impermissible that certain persons in the United States havenot abandoned their plans for bringing marines into Laos and waging war therewith the help of special military units. In the United States these units are, for some reason or other, called guerrilla units.In reality they are nothing but forces for the purposes of wrecking and sabotage, intended for action against the peoples of those countries whose regimesdo not suit the ruling circles of the United States. It can be said in advance thatthose who seek to try such methods have not weighed all the consequences for themselves.If the United States Government really seeks peace in Laos it should promote the speedy success of the talks in Geneva. No one should delay these talks underinvented pretexts of various kinds, claims that in Laos there has been a breachTOP SECRET59331 D
of the cease-fire agreement. If there have been such instances, then it has notbeen the national patriotic forces that have been responsible. The Americanside and its military advisers in Laos are well aware of this.We shall continue our efforts to ensure a peaceful settlement in Laos. Andwe urge all the other States taking part in the talks in Geneva to do the same.We are proceeding on the basis of the concept that if one really seeks, not war,but peace, then relations between States with different social systems should be built on the basis of peaceful co-existence.It emerged from our talks with President Kennedy that we understand the peaceful co-existence of States differently. The Presidents idea is to build upsomething like a dam against the peoples&apos; movement to establish in their countriessocial systems which the ruling circles of the Western Powers consider unsuitable.If one takes such a view of them one must conclude an agreement and assumeobligations to control other States, to prevent any changes of the existing systemsin those States, even if the peoples rebel against those systems. It turns out thatif the people of a country want to change their social and political system, thisshould not be allowed.Naturally this is an absolutely wrong concept and we, of course, cannot agreewith it. It is not in anyone&apos;s power to halt the peoples&apos; striving for freedom.All regimes which are built on the oppression and exploitation of peoples areunstable and cannot exist forever. And no matter how cunningly a system ofexploitation and oppression is built up, the peoples will still win freedom andoverthrow the oppressors. The changing of the social and political life of societyis an inevitable process. It does not depend on agreement between statesmen.If anyone were to display such folly and seek to get agreement on this question,he would thereby be displaying his own worthlessness and lack of unstanding of the events and the changes taking place in the world.It is impossible to bar the peoples&apos; advance to progress, to a better life. Thishas been proved by the entire course of human development. At one time slaveryexisted; it was replaced by feudalism, and then the place of feudalism was takenby capitalism. One system replaced another, because the new system was themore progressive.One could cite the example of the United States itself, which emerged in thestruggle against the colonial yoke of Britain. The American people waged abitter liberation struggle and won independence by force of arms. At one timethe United States considered such a course of events to be normal. Yet now, whenpeoples rise to struggle against reactionary regimes, against their oppressors, theUnited States tries to interfere in the affairs of those countries in order to preserve the old regimes.The representatives of imperialist States want to find a way to preventliberation ideas, the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, from spreading further. Whenthe people of a capitalist or colonial country, showing their discontent with theexisting system, seek to change it, to establish a new system corresponding to their interests, then the Governments of the imperialist countries immediately announce that this is a communist intrigue, the hand of Moscow, and SO&apos; on. They are notaverse to using such inventions as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.The assistance of imperialist States to reactionary forces in other countries isfraught with great danger and could lead to great complications. The Sovietpeople and other freedom-loving peoples firmly stand for non-interference in the domestic affairs of any country. This is an essential condition for ensuring peace.Every people has the right to independence and a free national existence and noState should interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. A class struggleis under way in the capitalist countries. The peoples are fighting against theiroppressors, against reactionary regimes. It is impossible to regulate these processesby agreement. Anyone who might want to reach an agreement on this question,would only be showing that he did not understand history, did not understand the laws of development of society.We believe that the most important thing that the Western Powers, andparticularly the United States, should recognise is that socialism is now frimly established in the world and it is not in anyone&apos;s power to change this fact. Itis common knowledge that the ruling circles of the Western Powers have in the
past harboured plans for abolishing the socialist system and do so at the presenttime. But these attempts failed in the past and will fail again. It is essentialto proceed on the basis of the fact that two social systems exist in the world andto build relations between the socialist and capitalist systems in such a way asto ensure peaceful co-operation between them. This is the only sensible path tobe taken in the relations between States in order to ensure peace.That is what I wanted to say, comrades, about our talks with the Presidentof the United States. I must point out that on the whole I am pleased with thesetalks. If you were to ask me whether it was worth while negotiating this meeting,whether it was worth holding it, I would reply without hesitation: this meeting was worth while and, moreover, it was necessary.In our talks with the President of the United States neither side evadedbringing up and discussing the most acute questions. It can be said that we hadfrank talks. We listened with attention to the position of the United StatesGovernment and set out in detail the position of the Soviet Government on anumber of major international problems. That in itself is quite important. Ofcourse, no one thought that we would reach complete agreement-after all, thepaths followed by our two countries are too widely divergent to expect that. ButI have the impression that President Kennedy understands the great responsibilitythat rests with the Governments of two such powerful States. I should liketo hope that the awareness of this responsibility will remain in the future, so thatoutstanding international problems may be solved, so that the rocks that bar theway to a lasting peace, to better relations between the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates, may be removed.At the present time the relations between our countries leave much to be desired, and this situation has not developed through the fault of the Soviet Union.But we would like to believe that there will come a time when Soviet-american relations will improve, and this will have a favourable influence on the entireinternational situation.In Vienna we worked to what might be called a crowded timetable. the realisation that we represented the great Soviet Union gave us energy and made our task easier. We knew that our Leninist foreign policy enjoys the wholeheartedsupport of the Soviet people, of the peoples of the socialist countries.The sympathies of hundreds of millions of people all over the world are on our side.The Soviet Government will continue to carry out in all consistency theLeninist policy of peaceful co-existence, the policy of strengthening peace andfriendship between peoples. ,Thank you, dear comrades.Good-bye, Goodnight.
ANNEX ESPEECH BY Mr. KHRUSHCHEV AT A KREMLIN MEETINGON 21st JUNEDear Comrades,Twenty years have passed since the day when fascist Germany perfidiously,without a declaration of war, attacked the Soviet Union, interrupted the peacefulwork of the Soviet people and thrust a hard and devastating war upon us.The entire Soviet people rose in defence of their great homeland, in defence ofthe achievements of socialism. A sacred people&apos;s war against the nazi invasionbegan. The gigantic forces, the unbending will of the Soviet people, closely ralliedbehind their own Communist Party, became manifest in all their greatness duringthis war.In his report the Minister of Defence, Marshal of the Soviet Union ComradeRodion Yakovlevich Malinovsky, and other comrades who have spoken here foundfine words to describe the immortal exploit of the Soviet people, of our gallantarmed forces in the Patriotic War. We again and again turn to the events of theSecond World War because from the war itself and the period preceding it the peoples can derive highly instructive lessons.Long ago, at the time when Hitler, the German fascist, was striving to seizepower, our party and the Soviet Government resolutely exposed the predatorynature of fascism and warned the peoples of the danger threatening them. TheSoviet Union was the only State which tirelessly called for fascism to be curbed,for it to be prevented from unleashing another world war. The voice of soviet representatives rang out loudly in the League of Nations, and at anti-war congresses,persistently urging that fascism be rebuffed and calling for unity in the struggle against the approaching disaster of war.The Soviet Government suggested concrete measures for safeguarding thesecurity of the peoples. It submitted to the League of Nations a proposal for generaland complete disarmament, offered a collective security system which, if accepted,would have tied the hands of the fascist aggressors.When the direct danger of war confronted the world, the Soviet Governmentaddressed France with a proposal to come out jointly against Hitler Germany in defence of Czechoslovakia. We also tried to reach agreement for the bourgeoisGovernments of Poland and Roumania to let our troops cross their territories tohelp Czechoslovakia.But the ruling circles of the bourgeois States, blinded by hatred for our socialistcountry and afraid of the world revolutionary movement, did not accept a singleone of the Soviet Governmenfs proposals, though the advisability of acceptingthem was obvious to all.The entire pre-history of the Second World War is a disgraceful chapter in thepolicy of the so-called Western democracies. The ruling circles of Britain, France,Poland and other States did not shrink from betraying the national interests oftheir peoples. Mankind will never forget the disgraceful Munich collusion of 1938when the rulers of Britain and France threw the Czechoslovak republic at the feet of the fascist invaders.The peoples had to pay for this treacherous policy with the lives of millions of their sons and daughters and with terrible privations.Remember the story of the despatch of the British and French military missionsto Moscow in the summer of 1939. The Soviet Government then suggestedabsolutely concrete plans for joint actions by the armed forces of the three powers in the event of Germany provoking a war in Europe. At that, time it would notyet have been too late to halt the aggressor. Had the ruling circles of Britain andFrance at that time expressed the desire and the will to rebuff the aggressor,Hitler would have thought twice before unleashing the war. History might havetaken quite a different course. There might have been no world war. Mankindwould not have suffered such tremendous sacrifices and losses.
The Soviet Government then saw through the perfidy of the imperialast circleswhich, conniving with the aggressor, wanted to crush the Soviet Union by meansof Hitler&apos;s war machine. We understood that by their policy of flirting with Hitlerthe Western Powers pursued only one aim to direct German aggression againstthe Soviet Union. It was clear to us that German fascism was acting as the mailedfist of world reaction, which was dreaming of crushing our country the strongholdof the international revolutionary movement.The Western Powers had a far-reaching scheme to destroy the Soviet union and at the same time to weaken Germany in order to have undivided dominationover the world and to dictate their own terms to everyone. This scheme was expressed most cynically by Harry Truman, a former Senator and later Presidentof the United States. He said: &quot; If we see that Germany is winning we ought tohelp Russia and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible . . .&quot;Such a policy, the essence of which was so bluntly set forth by Truman, wascarried through by the Western Powers. These ideas are still alive in the minds of the aggressive imperialist circles of the West.They are not averse to trying this once again if they could find a force theycould push against the Soviet Union.But now there is no such force. The might of the Soviet Union and the entiresocialist camp has grown so much that if the Western Powers mobilised all their forces in an attempt to liquidate the achievement of the peoples of the socialistcountries, even then they would fail utterly.Even the representatives of the imperialist Powers themselves now say that a balance of power between the Western States and the socialist countries has nowbeen established in the world. Realisation of this represents progress on their part.But this progress would be even greater if those who understand the situationin this way would actually conduct a policy in keeping with the present balanceof power, that is to say, a policy of peace and peaceful co-existence.On the eve of the Second World War, the so-called Western democraciesconducted a two-faced policy and the Soviet Government became convinced thatthey did not want to join efforts with the Soviet Union against the fascist countries Germany and Italy that they were seeking to prod nazi Germany against our country. Then the Soviet Government had no other recourse but to enter into negotiations with Hitler, although it realised that it was making a deal with thedevil incarnate.It was the perfidious policy of the ruling circles of Britain and France thatimpelled us to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany in August 1939. Wecould not act otherwise. We had to prevent the establishment of a united anti-Soviet front of the- imperialist Powers and to give our people a peaceful breathing space.Later events showed the short-sightedness of the policy of the western governments and the soundness of the position of the Soviet Union.The first blow of Hitler Germany fell upon the Western countries. But theyput up such weak resistance that Hitler, after routing them one by one withoutexhausting his forces, returned to his main aim -the attack on the Soviet Union.In the war against the Soviet Union the German imperialists pursued not onlypredatory but also class objectives to destroy the first socialist State in the world.They expected to attain their oim in a brief space of time and with little loss of blood. This is precisely how the well-known Barbarossa plan was drawn up, underwhich the nazis expected to overrun our country even before the end of the autumn of 1941.But the calculations of the German militarists were one thing and reality was quite another. Our armed forces, the whole Soviet people, gave a heroic rebuffto the invaders. The war assumed a protracted nature; it became the most bloodyof all wars in history. It took a toll of many millions of lives and broughtunbelievable sufferings to the peoples. Enormous material values created by thework of many generations perished in the flames of the war. But the people stoodthe test of this war and routed fascist Germany. Hitler had to shoot himself andother fascist ringleaders who did not commit suicide were put on trial.
But many war criminals as, for instance, Heusinger, Speidel and Fortsch succeeded in escaping punishment. Now, far from having any qualms of consciencefor their black deeds, they have succeeded in getting recognition of their &quot; services.&quot;from our former allies and occupy top commanding posts in NATO. Apparently,the ruling circles of the Western Powers have profited little from the lessons ofthe past.Sixteen years have already passed since the end of the war, but no peace treatyhas been concluded with Germany so far. Every sober-minded man or womanknows that people striving for peace end a war by signing a peace treaty and createall the conditions for ending the state of war at the earliest possible date.The Western Powers do not want to end the war by signing a peace treaty,which is the normal thing to do. They strive to preserve the state of war withGermany. What for? For peace? Certainly not! When a peace settlement isartificially delayed, and on top of that, when those who offer to conclude a peace treaty are threatened with war, the peoples must take a serious view of such a situation. They must block the way to those who push matters towards theunleashing of a third world war in which, not scores of millions, but hundreds ofmillions of people may die,Who is interested in the absence of a German peace treaty? What forces arepreventing its conclusion?Certainly not the German people or the peoples of Europe who have experienced the horrors of two world wars within the last few decades. Theconclusion of a peace treaty is opposed by those forces in Western Germany whichthink of revenge and are hatching plans for new military gambles. But it is clear to everyone that what matters is not only the Bonn militarists and the survivingHitlerites. The schemes of the revenge-seekers are encouraged and supported bythe ruling circles of the Western Powers.Having ended the war, the peoples of the countries of the anti-Hitler coalitionhoped and believed that Germany, who had been the initiator of the two worldwars, would never again become a centre of militarism and aggression.And what has happened, in fact? Western Germany has now become aninfluential member of the aggressive military NATO bloc. Hitler&apos;s generals notonly command the Bundeswehr but also hold key posts in the NATO forces; theyare in command of those French and British soldiers whose fathers fought and diedin battles against the nazi invaders. In France and Britain, with the consent ofthe Governments of -these countries, units of West German troops are beinginstructed and trained for new campaigns. Militarists of the Federal Republic ofGermany have already got hold of rocket weapons and are insistently demandingatomic weapons for the Bundeswehr.Recently we discussed all these questions in detail with the United StatesPresident, Mr. Kennedy, in Vienna.We explained to him in detail why the conclusion of a German peace treatycan no longer be delayed indefinitely. This treaty must set the seal to the situationwhich has arisen since the Second World War. Essentially we want nothing else.The position of the Soviet Government on this question is known to the whole world. It was stated comprehensively in the memorandum which was handed tothe United States President and published later in the Press.I dwelt in detail on the German question in my recent radio and televisionspeech and I believe there is no need to expound our proposals again in everydetail.What is the Western reaction to our position?The proposals of the Soviet Government have attracted great interest andevoked a wide response in all countries. All people who are interested in strengthening peace recognise the need for solving the problem of a peace treaty with Germany, realise that this problem is not only ripe for solution but even over-ripe. They support our proposals, which are aimed at a peaceful settlement of theGerman problem and offer a good basis for this.At the same time, it must be said that the ruling circles of the Western Powersstill oppose the conclusion of a German peace treaty and would like to turn theGerman question into a touchstone for a test of strength.
To-day I should like to warn those who, like Chancellor Adenauer, in replyto the peaceful proposals of the Soviet Union call for &quot; standing firm &quot; or eventhreaten to &quot; administer a rebuff &quot;.On more than one occasion we have reminded the leaders of the federal republic of Germany about the merits of reason. Is it possible, gentlemen, thatyou have forgotten the inglorious experience of your predecessors and would liketo repeat it? You may try to repeat it, of course.But that would be the beginning of the end for you. Now times are not whatthey were 20 years ago. Now, not only German revenge-seekers, but all those who might try to support them in a new adventure against us would share the fate of hitler.These words should not be taken as a threat. This is an appeal to reason.It is high time to understand at last that the Soviet Union is different now, thatthe world is different, and that the balance of forces and armaments is also different.Therefore, Mr. Chancellor, do not try to frighten us with your &quot; firmness &quot;.You say that if we conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republicyou will stop at nothing.  This indicates only the weakness of your positions.Everyone knows that we do not want war. But if you really threaten us with war, we are not afraid of such a threat. If you do unleash a war, that will be yoursuicide.It goes without saying that some unreasonable person might commit suicide.His relatives would weep over him but mankind would not suffer from that. but when statesmen invested with high authority play with fire and threaten to plungetheir country into the maelstrom of war, they are staking not only their own livesbut also the destiny of the peoples. By dragging Western Germany into anadventure, you are pushing the people of your country to suicide.The Soviet people do not want war, and for this very reason we are striving toremove what can cause an outbreak of war. For the sake of this, at the end ofthis year, we, together with other peace-loving States, will sign a peace treaty withthe German Democratic Republic.It is not war, not an alliance of some countries against others for the purposeof building up forces for war, that the Soviet Union is offering. We want one thing only lasting peace. It is to strengthen peace that it is essential to conclude a peace treaty, and thus eliminate the remnants of the Second World War. this we openly proclaim and we want one and all to understand us correctly. TheSoviet Union wants to sign a peace treaty with Germany together with ourformer allies.Contrary to the noisy allegations of those who would like to keep upinternational tension, we do not threaten West Berlin at all when we urge theconclusion of a peace treaty. We should sincerely like to come to terms on thisquestion, too, with those countries with which we fought together against HitlerGermany and have common commitments with regard to Germany.We propose for West Berlin the status of a free city. We have no intentionof changing the social and political system in West Berlin. That is the internalaffair of its population. Neither the Soviet Union nor the German democratic republic intend to restrict the links between West Berlin and all countries ofthe world.In accordance with international law, however, there must be respect for the sovereign rights of the German Democratic Republic, across whose territory run the communications connecting West Berlin with the outer world.On the question of West Berlin the Governments of the United States, Britainand France adhere to the positions of yesterday. Even Western political leaders have to admit this. Mansfield, leader of the Democratic majority in the UnitedStates Senate, declared in his speech of 14th June, this year, that he could not agree with the position of the Kennedy Administration which failed to recognise the enormous changes that had occurred since the war in both parts of Germanyand in Europe and which was fraught with the danger of a nuclear war.He emphasised that courage does not mean taking one&apos;s stand stubbornly onuntenable positions, but seeking agreement with the other parties concerned on abusinesslike basis. This is a correct approach and we can only welcome it.Senator Mansfield does not deny that, with appropriate internationalguarantees, the free city idea is the most suitable in the present conditions.   He
has suggested that the Federal Republic of Germany and the German democratic republic should sign such a decision and make their contribution to its realisation.It is true that Mansfield then loses his sense of reality-he demands that thefree city status should be applied, not only to West Berlin, but also to DemocraticBerlin, which is known to be an integral part of the sovereign German democratic republic its capital. Why complicate still further the task of normalising thesituation in West Berlin, difficult as it is?The Soviet Union proposes that in the search for a solution the de facto andde jure situation now existing be taken as the point of departure. No one isdemanding that the existing way of life of the population of West Berlin bedisrupted and no one is going to intervene in its affairs.The Soviet Union, however, cannot be expected to agree to infringement ofthe territorial integrity of the German Democratic Republic or of its sovereignty.We propose that a peace treaty be concluded with Germany which will notinfringe the rights and interests of any of the parties and will not give some Statesan advantage over others. The Soviet Union only proposes that what has longsince taken shape and exists in reality be recorded. We propose de jureconsolidation of the existing frontiers of Germany.It is possible that the present frontiers do not please the West Germanrevenge-seekers, but they have only themselves to blame. It was not we whobegan the war for the revision of frontiers. The present frontiers of Germanytook shape as a result of the defeat of nazi Germany, as a result of the defeat ofthose who unleashed a predatory war.The new frontiers restored historic justice which had been violated by theancestors of the present-day German militarists.We are told that the peace treaty we are going to conclude with the german democratic Republic will be a separate treaty. In my radio and television speechI have already said that the United States in signing a peace treaty with Japan, didnot take us into consideration, although we had been its allies in the war against japan. Thus it showed that it regarded itself as being entitled to sign a treatywithout us, although our rights, as one of the victorious countries, were irrefutable.Now we, in our turn, want to exercise on the German question the same rights which the United States and its friends exercised on the Japanese question.We are following suit no more.As regards those who try to threaten us with war if we sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, they will bear the entire responsibility fortheir actions.I should like to repeat that all sober-minded people, no matter how embitteredthey may be against communism, against the Soviet Union, must realise that weare living now in 1961 and not in 1941. We have all necessary means of defence.And we shall use these means not for attack but only in order to defend our country, the peaceful life of the Soviet people, the peoples of all socialist countries,who together with us take their stand on positions of peace and uphold peaceagainst the machinations of the German revenge-seekers and their patrons.Comrades, the indomitable might of socialism was fully manifested in theGreat Patriotic War. The Soviet Union bore the brunt of the struggle againstHitler Germany, which by the time it attacked our country, had conquered mostof the European countries.We have always said that we achieved victory over fascism jointly with our allies in the anti-Hitler coalition. The Soviet people duly appreciate the assistancerendered them in the course of the war by the United States, Britain, France andother countries. I believe, however, that our former allies themselves realise thatthe decisive contribution to victory was made by the Soviet people and we in no way belittle their merits and efforts when we recall the selfless heroism of theSoviet people.All the decisive battles of the Second World War were fought on the eastern front. Whereas the United States lost in the Second World War approximately300,000 men and Britain approximately 250,000, on our front such losses weresustained in individual battles. There is hardly a single family in our country which did not suffer from the war. Our people lost the lives of many millions oftheir finest sons and daughters.
Yes, it was a very hard struggle but the Soviet Union stood the test. Notonly did it stand the test but it emerged from the ordeal of the Second World Wareven stronger than it was.Within a brief space of time the Soviet people repaired all the war damage.Now even our sworn enemies admit that the Soviet Union is one of the strongestPowers from a military standpoint. Besides, the Soviet Union is not alone now.We are living and working within a great community of socialist countries whosepopulation exceeds 1,000 million.In unleashing the Second World War the imperialists hoped to bury socialism.But actually it was the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini that was buried under theruins of war, while socialism has become even more firmly rooted in the world.We communists believe in the triumph of the great ideas of Marxism and-Leninism in the name of which the Soviet people fought during the years of theSecond World War, not sparing any efforts or even life itself.And it is because we believe in our ideas that, now as in the past, we stand for peace and international friendship, and fight for general disarmament.As long ago as 1922, on Vladimir Ilyich Lenin&apos;s instructions, the soviet delegation came forward with a disarmament proposal at the Genoa Conference.In 1927 the Soviet Union submitted its disarmament proposals to the League ofNations. Since the Second World War the Soviet Union has been pressing forthe solution of the disarmament problem with even greater persistence.In 1959, on behalf of the Soviet Government, I submitted to the united nations a full-scale plan for general and complete disarmament under strictinternational control. We firmly stand by this position because we sincerely wantdisarmament, which is essential for ensuring peace for all people.In our plea for disarmament, for the peace and security of the peoples, forthe peaceful co-existence of States with different social systems, we proceed fromthe idea that the government and social system of any country is the internal affairof each people and that no one may impose some particular social system upon it.The bosses of monopoly capital who determine the policy of the western powers, naturally have a conception of the state and the social and political system which is diametrically opposite to ours. They want to perpetuate the capitalistsystem at all costs, to preserve the system existing in their countries under whichthe strong plunder the weak and the rich exploit the poor and appropriate the fruits of their labour. The socialist countries are developing on a differentfoundation. In socialist society all people are really equal because we have nocapitalists and no proletarians; every member of society discharges his definitesocial function, working for the good of the whole people and therefore for hisown good.The higher production rises the richer becomes our country, the richer becomesour entire society and every member of this society enjoys the benefits of sociallabour. In the socialist society all are equal and this equality in our countryis real and not formal, as is the case in the so-called &quot; free world &quot;, where the strong are free to plunder and oppress the weak.Such are the opposing conceptions of the two worlds the capitalist world and the socialist world. There will never be a reconciliation between them and itis our firm conviction that the socialist conception, as the most progressive one,will prevail over the capitalist conception. But we stress again and again: thesocial system is the affair of the people of each country and this question must bedecided by the people itself without external interference.The Soviet Government is doing everything in its power to ensure the peaceful co-existence of States with different social systems, to see to it that they not onlyco-exist without war, but also closely co-operate, maintaining brisk business-liketrade, cultural, scientific and other contacts.It is to ensure lasting peace that we wage the struggle for disarmament.Although the Western Powers, and the United States in the first place, stubbornlyreject disarmament under some pretext or other, we shall insist on our proposalsagain and again and shall strive persistently to make all people understand theneed for solving the disarmament problem, because this is in the interests of the peoples.The ruling circles of capitalist countries lack the courage to say openly thatthey are against disarmament.  They pretend that they are ready to negotiateTOP SECRET59331 b
and express their readiness to sit endlessly on various committees and sub-committees.How many meetings of various kinds on disarmament have been held in the16 years since the end of the Second World War, without a single step forwardbeing taken in this matter!Representatives of countries of monopoly capital go to disarmament talks with the sole purpose of misleading their peoples, to lure them with the hope ofagreement but in reality to sabotage disarmament, to continue the furious armsrace. And they would like to do this so ingeniously that the blame for sabotagingagreement can be laid upon the socialist countries.For this purpose bourgeois diplomacy and propaganda are hard at workspreading the fabrication that we propose disarmament without control and thusprevent agreement on disarmament.We have exposed this machination. We have declared in the United Nations :Gentlemen, if you want agreement not merely in words but in deeds, accept our proposals for universal disarmament, and then we shall accept any of your proposals on control.The enemies of disarmament have nothing to say to that. They have onlyone path open to them: to mislead the peoples and to repeat endlessly the fablethat we stand for disarmament without control. But, as the saying goes, lies have,short legs and one cannot get far on them!In conditions in which the Governments of the Western Powers stubbornlysabotage disarmament, the solution of this vital problem entirely depends uponthe peoples. All peoples must realise the serious nature of the present situation and bring pressure to bear on those Governments which obstruct the solution of thedisarmament problem the most important problem of our time.The working people, intellectuals, all people who want peace, can and mustcompel the Governments of capitalist countries to accept disarmament. If thisis not done, the imperialist circles may bring the peoples to a war, and then it willbe too late to look for the culprits. Modern war has its own inexorable law- the mass extermination of people, the destruction of all material values.I speak about this in all seriousness in order to make plain to all the importanceof an active struggle for disarmament, on the outcome of which the future of mankind will depend in many respects. As for the Soviet Union, the people ofall countries may rest assured that it will not be found wanting.We are ready to sign, even tomorrow, an agreement on general and complete disarmament with any, the most strict, international control. But we shall not accept control without disarmament, because such control would in effect beespionage.In this connexion I should like to say a few words on the question of a nuclearweapon test ban. At the Geneva talks the Western Powers have adopted an attitude which does not make it possible to reach agreement to end these tests.In its recent memorandum the Soviet Government has proposed aninterdependent solution of the problems of ending nuclear weapon tests and ofgeneral and complete disarmament. The other day the United States Governmentsent us a memorandum rejecting our proposal. We shall reply to the White Housememorandum. But already now I am in a position to say that we firmly standby the views we have stated.For close on three years already the Soviet Union has been making no nuclearweapon tests, although we have no treaty with the Western Powers on this matter.We can continue refraining from nuclear tests and propose to the Western powers that agreement be reached on the disarmament problem as a whole and on itscomponent parts, including the question of nuclear weapon tests.Some American leaders are urging the United States Government to resumenuclear weapon tests, if the Soviet Union does not accept the Western Powers&apos;demands. .What can be said about such threats? They will frighten no one but willmerely expose the unreasonableness of those who resort to them. We must warnthese gentlemen: as soon as the United States resumes nuclear explosions, the
Soviet Union will start testing its nuclear weapons. Quite a few devices which need practical testing have been developed in the Soviet Union. This testing, ofcourse, will increase the fighting power of our armed forces and enable us todevelop even better atomic and hydrogen bombs, will enable us to improve thetechnology of their manufacture.If in reply to the resumption of nuclear tests by the Western Powers we didnot start testing our weapons, we would be harming the defence potential of our country and of the entire socialist community.Thus, the entire responsibility for the resumption of nuclear weapon tests will rest with the Governments of the Western Powers.The Soviet Union is persistently pursuing a policy of peace, of the peaceful co-existence of States with different social systems, a policy of non-interference byStates in the internal affairs of others.In negotiations with its partners, the Soviet Union is pressing for the conclusionof an agreement on general and complete disarmament under the strictest control,an agreement banning nuclear weapons.Steadily pursuing our peace-loving foreign policy, we have always maintained that questions concerning the social and political system of a State, questions ofthe class struggle and of changing the system within a country, are the business ofthe people of each State.The Soviet foreign policy has earned the recognition and trust of the peoples and we are proud of this. The Soviet Union, the&quot;countries of socialism, are makingtremendous efforts to preserve world peace, are seeking the peaceful solution ofdisputed and unsettled problems in international relations.The Soviet Union, possessing tremendous economic and military might, has never used and will not use its strength for aggressive purposes. On the contrary,it directs all its efforts towards ensuring peace.Comrades, I am proud of a high award bestowed upon me the Lenin Prizefor the Consolidation of Peace among the Peoples. I have already said that I regard this prize, not only as recognition of my personal efforts as the Head of theGovernment of the Soviet Union, but also as recognition of the efforts of all peoples of our country in their persistent struggle for the strengthening of peace.It is often said in our Press that Khrushchev is a peace champion, that he will ensure world peace and so on.  This is flattering, of course.But to pin hopes on one country, on one person, even if he stands at the headof the Government of such a country as the Soviet Union, and to expect that theyalone can ensure peace while others remain inactive, means to do a service, not to peace, but to the forces of aggression, the forces of war.Life shows that to win world peace it is not enough to rely on the efforts ofsome single country. It is not enough to find &quot; heroes &quot; of some sort and rely on them to ensure peace.In order to ensure lasting peace on earth it is essential for the peoples of ourentire planet to make an all-out effort to strengthen peace. The peoples, and the peoples alone, can force the Governments which resist disarmament, which arebuilding up stocks of arms in order to unleash war, to desist from such a dangerous and unreasonable policy.Peace can be ensured only when the peoples of each country do not rely on other countries but launch within their own country an irreconcilable struggle against the forces which stand for war, when they make an all-out effort to ensurepeace.All the peoples want peace, want peaceful co-existence. Only a handful ofimperialists, of representatives of monopoly capital and a handful of aggressiverevenge-seekers in Western Germany are of a different opinion. But the trouble is that representatives of these circles hold the commanding positions in the western countries, occupy the majority of key posts in the Governments and determine thepolicy of the Western countries.This is why any people who really want the terrible conflagration of the mostdevastating war never to break out on earth cannot remain aloof from the commonstruggle for peace.The peoples must realise that only they can and must compel their governments to renounce the dangerous policy aimed at stirring up war passionsTOP SECRET59331 e 2
and intensifying the arms race, only they can and must render harmless those people who conduct a policy of building up aggressive forces, a policy of preparingwar.The Soviet Government and our people must closely follow the trends in theinternational situation. It is well known that the Soviet Union has made great efforts to achieve a relaxation of international tension.Our Government has submitted a proposal on general and complete disarmament which has met with an enthusiastic response and support in allcountries of the world. We have withdrawn all our military bases abroad. TheSoviet Union has repeatedly reduced its armed forces on a unilateral basis.However, the Western Powers with which we are negotiating on disarmamenthave not reciprocated, have not adopted the path of reducing their armed forces.Far from that, the United States this year is increasing appropriations forarmaments by close on $2,500 million as compared with last year.At present in the United States they are discussing the question of increasingthe numerical strength of the armed forces. They are busy there establishingso-called guerilla detachments which are to be dispatched to other countries to suppress liberation movements, to fight against Government and State systemswhich do not suit the imperialist Western circles. These detachments are beingtrained for murder, sabotage, subversion.Chancellor Adenauer is demanding nuclear weapons for the Bundeswehr. Itgoes without saying that it is not for play that the West German militarists want tohave nuclear weapons, but for the revengeful adventures they are planning againstthe Soviet Union, the socialist countries and Other States.Naturally, such measures of the Western Powers are not designed to improve the international climate or to reach agreement on disarmament, but to worsenrelations between States, to whip up the cold war. We must take a sober viewof the situation, be vigilant, so that the enemies of socialism, the aggressivemilitarist circles may not catch us unawares.We must make every effort to strengthen still more the might of our homeland,to raise still higher the level of our economy, science and technology, to raise the living and cultural standards of the peoples.Now, as hitherto, we must be tireless in our concern for the armed forces ofour country, which stand guard over the gains of the October Revolution, thegains of socialism. Our armed forces must always be ready to ensure reliablythe security of the Soviet Union, must have all that is needed to smash immediatelyany enemy who encroaches on the freedom of our homeland. Let those whoharbour aggressive designs against the Soviet Union and other socialist countriesknow what their fate will be if they unleash a war and attack!The Soviet Government is doing everything in its power to end the arms race,to relieve the people of the grave burden of war expenditures.Unfortunately, to our appeal to compete in the production of material andspiritual values, the imperialist Powers respond by increasing militaryappropriations, by increasing the numerical strength of their armed forces. this might make it imperative for the Soviet Union to increase likewise appropriationsfor armaments, to strengthen and improve our defences, and, if need be, to increasealso the numerical strength of our armed forces, so as to ensure peace and peaceful co-existence, relying on our might.Dear Comrades, allow me, on behalf of the central committee of our party and the Soviet Government, to greet our valiant armed forces, which stand guardover the constructive labour of the Soviet people.We warmly greet the men of the army and navy, N.C.Os. and petty officers,the officers, generals and admirals, and wish them great success in their noblemilitary duty.The strengthening of the defences of the Soviet Union depends on theperfection of all the services of our armed forces the infantry and artillery, the engineers and communications troops, the armoured tank units and the navy,the air and rocket forces.In our time exceptionally great responsibility devolves upon the rocket forces,especially the units which service ballistic rockets of various ranges, from tacticalto intercontinental. Their combat readiness and training must be on the highest level because very much depends on the rocket forces.
It is their crushing power that is the prime deterrent that keeps any potentialaggressor from attacking us and our allies. Their capability of striking inretaliation is the force which will inexorably punish the aggressor if. after all,he dares to commit an act of madness and unleashes a new war.To-day on the 20th anniversary of the treacherous attack of Hitler germany on the Soviet Union, we think of those who gave their lives for the freedom and independence of the great Soviet homeland. Never will there be erased from thememory of the people the great exploit of the glorious soldiers of the Soviet army,of the navy men, of the valiant partisans, both men and women, who died the death of the brave in battles against the fascist invaders.We shall always remember the millions of peaceful Soviet people who perishedin that terrible war. There is no family in our country which did not lose ahusband or a son, a brother or a father, a daughter or a sister.The sacrifices made by our people in defending the freedom and independence of our country were tremendous. They were sacrifices for the sake of a great and noble cause. And now, 20 years after the outbreak of the Great PatrioticWar, 16 years after it ended, our country has reached unparalleled heights in thedevelopment of its economy, culture, science and technology and is firmly marchingonward to new victories.We are proud that the Soviet people led by the Communist Party, under thebanner of Marxism-Leninism, was the first to carry out a socialist revolution andusher in a new era in the history of mankind.The great founders of scientific communism opened up the first paths to abetter life. And now these paths have turned into the main highway of allmankind, along which the peoples of many countries are victoriously advancing.The Soviet people, having built socialism, are confidently marching along the road of building communism.The draft programme of our party approved the other day at a plenary session of the party&apos;s central committee a programme which will be publishedfor universal discussion outlines a broad front of extended struggle for theconstruction of communism, for the realisation of the age-old dream of allmankind. It has been our great good fortune to participate in this noble cause.Long live the Soviet people the victor people!Long live the valiant armed forces of the Soviet Union!Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union the organiser andinspirer of all our victories!Long live world peace!
ANNEX mr.. KHRUSHCHEVS SPEECH AT A MEETING OF SOVIET-VIETNAMESEFRIENDSHIP AT THE KREMLIN ON 28th JUNEDear Comrade Pham Van Dong, Dear Comrades, Friends, to-dayrepresentatives of the Moscow public are meeting the Government delegation ofthe Democratic Republic of Vietnam which has come to our country on a visit of friendship.Permit me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party ofthe Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Soviet Government,on behalf of all our people, to greet you cordially and through you the fraternalVietnamese people.The Soviet people have the most friendly and warm feelings for the democratic republic of Vietnam and its heroic and industrious people. They alwayssympathised with the selfless struggle the Vietnamese people waged for many yearsagainst colonial oppression, for their freedom and independence.Vietnam is an ancient country. It has a history going back over three thousandyears. The Vietnamese land is rich. This wealth, however, was not being usedfor the benefit of the people but served as a source of enrichment for colonialists.Through the fault of the imperialists Vietnam was very backward as regards its economic development. For nearly a hundred years colonialists plundered yourcountry, mercilessly exploiting its people. Poverty and hunger were the lot of theVietnamese working people.The freedom-loving Vietnamese&apos; people never accepted this; they foughtagainst imperialist and feudal domination. But this struggle became successfulonly when the Communist Party of Indo-China gave the lead to the revolutionarymasses.Glorious pages of your heroic struggle will remain forever in the annals of thestruggle of the peoples for national liberation. They were the 1930 battles for people&apos;s power in Ngean and Hatin, the August uprising in 1945, and then the grimyears of the resistance movement against colonial domination and imperialistaggression.The Soviet people, who know full well what a war for the independence ofthe homeland means, greatly appreciate the exploit of the heroes of the stormingof Dien Bien Phou. In that battle the brave sons of the Vietnamese people brokethe enemy&apos;s resistance, routed the colonialists&apos; troops and put an end to theimperialists&apos; domination in North Vietnam.After the victory of the revolution the Vietnamese people succeeded, in spiteof serious difficulties, in quickly healing the wounds and laying firm foundationsfor a new socialist economy.Under the leadership of the glorious Party of Labour of Vietnam and itscentral committee, headed by the loyal son of the Vietnamese people and prominentleader of the international communist movement, our great friend Ho Chi-minh,the working people of North Vietnam have successfully fulfilled the Three-year plan for laying the foundations of socialism.Now the Vietnamese people are selflessly working to fulfil their First Five-year plan for the development of their national economy. The fulfilment of this plan will be an important step in creating the material and technical foundations ofsocialism, in improving the well-being of the people.We wholeheartedly welcome your remarkable achievements, which vividlyshow to the whole world what people are capable of when they throw off theshackles of colonial slavery and rise to their full stature, when they bring thenational democratic revolution to a victorious conclusion.The building of a new life in the conditions of a formerly colonial countryravaged by war is not a simple task. We know that you are encountering great difficulties. But these difficulties are temporary. They are difficulties of growth and can be overcome.
We are firmly confident that the industrious and gifted Vietnamese people will achieve new and remarkable successes in further advancing and consolidatingtheir economy and culture. This is guaranteed by the socialist economic system,the unity and enthusiasm of the people and the correct leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Labour of Vietnam.In building socialism the Vietnamese people are receiving all-round anddisinterested assistance from the fraternal countries of the socialist camp whichhave been helping the Vietnamese people to build a new life on their native soiland are continuing to do so.The remarkable successes of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Republic, the Korean Democratic People&apos;s Republic and the MongolianPeople&apos;s Republic have confirmed the correctness of Lenin&apos;s ideas, have shownthat it is precisely the socialist system that opens up boundless opportunities forthe peoples who have rid themselves of colonial and imperialist oppression. Theexperience of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of the other socialist Statesassumes great importance for the oppressed peoples fighting for the implementation of their most cherished aspirations and hopes.The assertions of the advocates of colonialism that the ideas of Marx andLenin are not applicable in solving the social problems of colonial States, thatthese ideas cannot be near and dear to the peoples of the East, appearcontemptible and ludicrous.To-day only the politically blind can fail to see the processes taking place in theworld processes of the revival of peoples who were formerly oppressed and whoseroad of development is illumined, as if by a searchlight, by Marxism-Leninism.Comrades, we note with satisfaction that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,an equal member of the fraternal family of the socialist States, is advancing in thevanguard of the fighters for lasting world peace.We rejoice that our Vietnamese friends share and support the peace-lovingattitude of the Soviet Union, the countries of the socialist camp, on all the basicquestions of international policy. In its turn, the Soviet Government fully supportsthe policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam aimed atconsolidating peace in South-East Asia and throughout the world. We resolutelycome out, together with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,for the speediest solution of the problem of Vietnam&apos;s peaceful reunification. Theimperialists are striving to keep alive in South-East Asia the sparks that may bringabout a conflagration.In their time the 1954 Geneva agreements on Indo-China provided for the peaceful unification of Vietnam and the holding for this purpose of free general elections both in the north and in the south. But this did not suit certain imperialistcircles and, having installed in South Vietnam their lackey Ngo Dinh Diem, theydid everything possible to perpetuate the division of the country, to prevent the unification of brothers in the south and the north in one united family.In violation of the Geneva agreements the United States is delivering to SouthVietnam thousands of tons of military equipment and materials. It is continuing to equip and train the South Vietnamese army, sending numerous military advisersthere. It has actually drawn the South Vietnamese authorities into the SEATOmilitary ventures.Does this create conditions for the peaceful unification of Vietnam? Ofcourse not. All this is directed against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,against the Chinese People&apos;s Republic and against the other peace-loving Statesof South-East Asia.American officers are training South Vietnamese soldiers, preparing them forwar against their brothers in the north. The imperialists do not like the peopleddemocratic system, they would like to restore the colonial regime in the north ofthe country. But this, you see, is beyond their power. The Vietnamese people will never relinquish their gains and are vigilantly standing guard over them.The policy of the puppet authorities, alien to the people, arouses the justindignation of the Vietnamese people. The people are fighting in South Vietnamfor their freedom and independence, fighting against the betrayal of the national interests.Even the official Western representatives recognise that South Vietnam is notcontrolled by the puppet Government and that its capital, Saigon, is in fact
surrounded by seething popular wrath. There are people, however, who say thatthe struggle of the Vietnamese people against the puppet Ngo Dinh Diem is the&quot; doing of Moscow,&quot; communist intrigues. These people either really do not understand the events that are taking place or are deliberately, with evil intentions,misrepresenting the actual state of affairs. The struggle of the South Vietnamesepeople is not the doing of Moscow, not the intrigues of the communists. It is an expression of the people&apos;s anger, of the people&apos;s passionate determination to doaway with poverty and lack of rights, a struggle against the colonialist robbers,against their henchmen, who are pursuing a policy even crueller than the colonialiststhemselves. After all, a lackey who does the bidding of his master is always moreruthless than that master. But no terror, no repressions are able to suppress thepeople&apos;s movement.The Soviet Government gives all-out support to the Vietnamese people&apos;demand for the discontinuance of imperialist interference in the affairs of SouthVietnam. The Soviet people are deeply convinced that the just struggle of theVietnamese people for their country&apos;s unification will end in complete victory.All the attempts of the imperialists to prevent the implementation of the Vietnamesepeople&apos;s lawful aspirations will inevitably fail.The imperialists are trying hard to expand their influence and domination inSouth-East Asia. But their aggressive intentions are coming up against theopposition of the peoples. The policy of the imperialists has been especiallymanifest in relation to Laos.The course of events in Laos has confirmed with ample clarity the point ofview of the Governments of our countries that the deepening of the Laotian crisisis fraught with dangerous consequences for the cause of peace. There would havebeen no Laotian issue if the United States and its SEATO allies had not meddledwith the internal affairs of that country or tried to turn Laos into a base for theiraggressive policy in South-East Asia.For this purpose the imperialists organised an uprising against the lawfulGovernment of Souvanna Phouma. However, neither direct military aid to the rebels nor the dispatch of military advisers broke the fighting spirit of the Laotianpeople or extinguished their desire to see their country an independent neutralState.The firm unity and resolution of the national patriotic forces of Laos in thestruggle for their country&apos;s freedom and the support given to this just struggleby the peace-loving peoples of Europe and Asia have compelled the imperialiststo agree with the need for settling the Laotian question. To-day efforts are beingmade to solve the Laotian problem by peaceful means. It must be said that thereare favourable prerequisites for this following the achievement of a cease-firein Laos.A 14-Power conference on Laos is now meeting in Geneva. The soviet delegation has put forward a proposal that the conference should approve adeclaration on the neutrality of Laos and also sign an agreement on the withdrawalof foreign troops and military personnel from Laotian territory and on the powersof the International Commission.These proposals are wholeheartedly supported by the representatives of thelawful Government and the national democratic forces of Laos and theGovernments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Chinese People&apos;republic, the Polish People&apos;s Republic and other peace-loving countries.The Geneva conference has already been in session for a month and a half.But the proceedings of the conference show that the representatives of the UnitedStates of America and its allies are putting a brake on its work, evading a discussion on the Soviet Union&apos;s proposals and resorting to the tactics of delays andprocrastination.The Soviet Government has already declared and now confirms its resolve,together with other countries interested in a peaceful settlement of the Laotianproblem, to take all measures for ensuring a peaceful settlement in Laos on thebasis of recognition of the Laotian people&apos;s lawful rights.It is to be hoped that the Geneva conference will at last arrive at a reasonable solution acceptable to the Laotian people.We believe that the Laotian people themselves will settle their internal affairswithout any interference from outside.  They will themselves decide on the form
of their State organisation and outline the ways for their social, economic and cultural development, &amp;c. Laotian leaders are now negotiating in Laos and inSwitzerland with a view to settling these internal questions.Agreement on a cease-fire has been reached by the three basic political forcesof Laos and now concrete questions stemming from the discontinuation of militaryoperations are under discussion.A top-level meeting of representatives of these three forces Princes SouvannaPhouma, Souphanouvong and Boun Oum recently ended in Zurich.An agreement was reached at this conference on the questions of ensuringnational concord; a political programme of a Government of national unity wasadopted and the immediate tasks of this government were defined.The representatives of the three political forces agreed that Laos will pursuea policy of peace and neutrality in accordance with the interests and aspirations ofthe Laotian people, and the 1954 Geneva agreements, with a view to establishing a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, united and prosperous Laos.We regard this as a good basis for the further development of the countryand for the establishment of good relations with Laos by all States which sincerelysupport this policy.The line mapped out by the representatives of the three forces and set forth in their joint declaration is, in our opinion, a correct one.This is a good beginning and it can be hoped that the Laotians themselveswill soon settle their other internal problems, and that, in particular, a Governmentwill be formed which will firmly follow this line.The experience of the talks between the Laotians proves that, given the desire,it is possible to agree and not only to agree but also to start taking practical steps which will lead to the restoration of peace in Laos. This is necessary for theLaotian people in the first place; this is necessary for the cause of peace.Comrades, all peoples strive for lasting peace. They want neither a cold nora hot war. The Soviet Government is doing everything possible to strengthenpeace on earth. We have proposed a fundamental solution to the disarmamentproblem the disbanding of all national armies, the destruction of all existingstockpiles of weapons, the discontinuance of armaments production everywhere,that is to say, the carrying out of general and complete disarmament under international control.The discontinuance of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, on which theWestern countries are now centring their attention, does not in itself solve theproblem. The Soviet Union is against any nuclear explosions. Our Governmenthas always been and continues to be in favour of an international agreementbanning nuclear tests under strict and equal international control. The conclusionof such an agreement is obstructed by the refusal of our American and Britishpartners in the negotiations to take the Soviet interests into account.I would like to say once again that the discontinuance of nuclear weapon testswill not in itself rid the peoples of the threat of a devastating war. General and complete disarmament would be a fundamental solution.The Soviet Union is prepared at any time to start the practical implementation of complete disarmament. We suggest that disarmament be carried out under the strictest international control, which would guarantee strict fulfilment of thedisarmament programme by all States. We have no use for control over armamentswithout disarmament. The Soviet Government will not accept such control. Weare in favour of general and complete disarmament under all-embracing and comprehensive control. The Soviet Government is prepared to accept any systemof control over disarmament which the Western Powers may suggest only let them agree to genuine disarmament.Thus, the Western Powers&apos; allegations that we are against control hold nowater. Our partners in the negotiations realise that we want control. Furthermorethe Soviet Government will not agree to disarmament without control.They know this, but misrepresent our position because they have not thoughtup any other arguments as yet. As a matter of fact everything boils down to the unwillingness of certain Western circles to abandon the policy of the arms raceand the preparation of new military ventures. Only this can explain, too, the unwillingness of the Western Powers to promote a peaceful settlement withGermany, which would reliably ensure stability and security in Europe.
The Soviet Union is proposing that all the countries of the anti-Hitler coalition,on the one hand, and the two German States, on the other, should sign a peace treaty, thereby drawing a line under the Second World War. The past must notbe allowed to interfere with the present-day life of the peoples, to hang like a heavyweight on the legs of the people who wish to go forward. The militarist andrevenge-seeking forces must not be allowed to stir up the vestiges of theconflagrations of the Second World War, exposing Europe and all the world to thedanger of a new and still more destructive war.The Soviet Government proposes that the postwar frontiers in Europe be safeguarded from the encroachments of revenge-seekers and that the situation in west Berlin be improved. We propose that the obligation of the Germans neverto encroach upon the independence, freedom and sovereignty of other nations andto live with them in peace and friendship, without resorting to force or to the threat of force, be recorded in an international document. The peace treaty will not placeany country in a privileged position with regard to another country. It will conformin equal measure to the interests of all States.There are some hotheads in the West who obviously fly off the handle at theprospects of peace being consolidated in Europe. The Western Press makes agreat deal of noise about the proposal that a peace treaty be concluded and thatthe West Berlin issue be solved on this basis.Some people are suggesting that economic sanctions be used if a peace treaty is concluded, that is to say, that trade with us be discontinued.Trade is a purely voluntary matter. Everyone trades if it is beneficial for him.If it is disadvantageous for the West, then the West is free to take any decision.Threats to discontinue trade cannot, of course, prevent us from signing a German peace treaty.Others even speak of breaking off diplomatic relations with us. There is nothing new in that either. The West has already tried to live without diplomatic relations with us and even not to recognise the Soviet State. That venture fellthrough then. It is not difficult to see that an even more scandalous failure awaitsthe authors of such a venture in our own day.The greatest hotheads urge that mobilisation be carried out and that other measures of a military nature be adopted. Gentlemen, such measures have alsobeen taken against us. We were not only threatened, but attempts were even madeto break us by force. Our Red Army was steeled in battle against the imperialistStates. More than 40 years ago we did not flinch either before threats or interventionand we defeated the military ventures of the imperialists.The Soviet Union defeated Hitler&apos;s Germany, which was the mailed fist of world reaction. We have defended our freedom and independence in struggle against many enemies. It would be absolutely senseless to expect that a policy ofthreats and force with regard to the Soviet Union could yield some kind of fruitsfor the imperialists.Sabre-rattling, of course, is not a new thing and does not require much brains.The Soviet people will not be frightened by it and will not be halted in theirstriving to do away with the vestiges of the last war and to conclude a German peace treaty. The Soviet Union speaks with all nations in the language of reasonand friendship. The argument of threats has long become outmoded and mustbe filed in the archives. It is high time that this lesson was learned. But if a&quot; positions-of-strength &quot; language is imposed on us, we shall have the wherewithalwith which to answer. If the enemies of peace and peaceful co-existence carry outmobilisation just the same, we shall not allow them to catch us unawares. We aretaking the necessary measures and, if need be, shall take additional steps tostrengthen our security.We tell the lovers of military ventures: You are raising your hand againstthe peoples&apos; right to live in peace a right which they have won at the cost of many millions of lives in the struggle against fascism and which they wish to legalise ina German peace treaty. But you, gentlemen, will not be able to intimidate us the peace treaty will be signed!On the road to the easing of tension we shall, apparently, have to go through some stage of &quot; cooling &quot; in Europe. It will be artificial cooling, because there areno weighty reasons for it. But it is, apparently, wanted by international reactionand the revenge-seeking forces in Western Germany. The Western Powers cannot
get out of the quicksands of brinkmanship, into which Dulles and Eisenhower ledthem. They are stubbornly striving to pursue that fruitless policy to-day, contraryto logic and common sense, contrary to their own interests.The Western statesmen declare that the military strength of the capitalist andsocialist camps is now balanced. But in that case a balanced international policy should now be pursued, that is to say, relations should not be worsened and nothreats should be made. Unfortunately, there are no signs of common sense in theWestern policy-common sense which should stem from recognition of the existingcorrelation of forces in the world.What is more, the forces are not equal. We consider that the forces of socialismand peace are much stronger than the forces of imperialism and war. We are notonly relying on our economic and military might; we are also backed by therighteous cause of our people, the truth of all the peoples and all States that abide by positions of peaceful co-existence and the peaceful solution of all disputedinternational questions. The conclusion of a German peace treaty is the mostpeaceful of all peaceful decisions.It would seem that the Foreign Minister of Western Germany, von Brentano,should also realise that to-day is 1961 and not 1941. Yet he calls for the use of force and lives and is guided by the warlike ideas of his predecessor von Ribbentrop,who was a &quot; von &quot; under Hitler. I shall not remind you of the sad end of that&quot; von &quot;. But isn&apos;t it too early for the &quot; von &quot; under Adenauer to forget the end ofhis predecessor von Ribbentrop?Herr von Brentano is making unwise, incendiary speeches. He is courtingdisaster for the German people and the other peoples of Europe and Asia, whoare sick of war. Brentano is striving to intimidate us, but he is achieving quitethe opposite. The calls of Bonn revenge-seekers for force further strengthen our determination to uphold the just cause of peace. The ruling circles of the federal republic of Germany would like to perpetuate the postwar disaccommodation,not, of course, for the sake of peace but for the sake of building up forces andchoosing the moment for unleashing a new military venture. In order to do away with a dangerous seat of war, the peace-loving nations are stubbornly striving fora German peace treaty.The Western Powers are making great propaganda efforts to misrepresent the essence of the Soviet proposals for a peace settlement in Germany. They arespeculating with particular frequency on the so-called right of Germans to self-determination. Against the peace treaty they set the right to self-determination,striving to pose as champions of the national rights of the Germans.Let us not stop to show how unconvincing such words are when they comefrom persons who have done practically everything to undermine Germany&apos;s unity and then deepen the division of the country.It is well known that the imperialist Powers interpret the peoples&apos; right to self-determination and the question of reunifying divided nations as they see fit. Whenit is a question of Germany, they refer to the right of peoples to self-determination,demanding the reunification of Germany, although two States with different social and economic systems exist there. But in spite of this they are raising the questionof reunification just the same, because they hope that their ideas will triumph in areunified Germany, inasmuch as the population of Western Germany is much larger than that of the German Democratic Republic.But what happens with their &quot; abiding by principle &quot; in upholding the right ofpeoples to self-determination and reunification when it comes to other countries?We can refer, for instance, to the question of the reunification of Vietnam. I havealready said that under the 1954 international agreement general elections were tobe held in Vietnam within a two-year period with a view to determining the furthercourse of that nation&apos;s development.But the Western Powers, and above all the United States, have done everything possible to prevent those talks. They have been successful in this and Vietnam isstill divided into two parts. Why did the imperialists do this? Because they know that the people of South Vietnam have preserved their loyalty to democratic principles and, if given the right to express their will, they would undoubtedlycome out in favour of reunification with their brothers in North Vietnam on thesame social and political basis as that existing in the Democratic Republic ofVietnam. What, after that, is the value of the Western approach of principle tothe question of national unification?
The right of nations to self-determination is a national question. Germany&apos;sunification in the present conditions, however, is above all a social and classproblem.The Germans have been divided owing to the different development of the separate parts of the former German empire and the establishment of two states with different social and economic systems. A capitalist system exists in one State the Federal Republic of Germany and a socialist system exists in the german democratic Republic. Unification of two States, even when those States have asimilar system, is far from being an easy task. In any case that task cannot be solved from outside. A prerequisite for such unification must be the desire of thepopulation to live in a single State, a definite unanimity of views and interests onbasic internal and external problems.What can be said, then, about the unification of States with different socialsystems? Isn&apos;t it clear that their unification is a much more difficult matter inwhich dictation and attempts by one State to subjugate the other are intolerable.The unification of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal republic of Germany into a single State can be achieved only through talks and co-operationbetween the Governments of these States themselves. The other nations must not interfere in this internal affair of the Germans.The Government of the German Democratic Republic has proposed morethan once to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany that they should meet and negotiate ways for overcoming the division of Germany. The german democratic Republic has put forward the well-known proposal that a Germanconfederation be set up, which would make it possible to pool the efforts of bothGerman States on major questions common to all Germans.But Western Germany has refused, through Chancellor Adenauer, to conducttalks with the East Germans. It demands that the Great Powers should reunifyGermany, that they should throw the German Democratic Republic back frompositions of building socialism. This means swallowing up and not reunifying.Do the militarist and revenge-seeking forces of Western Germany really think thatit is possible to achieve this with our help, that is to say, with the help of the socialistStates?  They themselves can hardly believe such calculations to be practicable.Socialist Germany exists and is developing. She is our ally and can alwaysrely on our aid and support.We are threatening nobody by proposing that a German peace treaty be concluded and that the question of West Berlin be solved on this basis. I want to say once again that the social and economic system in West Berlin will remainsuch as its population wishes. We propose that reliable international guarantees of non-interference in the affairs of West Berlin be established. Let the four great powers be the guarantors and keep some contingent of their armed forces in thefree city, or such guarantees could be provided by the armed forces of neutralnations, or the United Nations organisation.There will be no blockade of West Berlin and no obstacles will be put up onthe routes of access to this city. West Berlin will be able to maintain free contacts with all States at its own discretion.Since the communication lanes to West Berlin pass through the territory of theGerman Democratic Republic, agreement with the Government of that State shouldbe reached, consequently, on their use, as the existing international traditions andlaws require. No one is allowed to violate the ground, air or water frontiers of a sovereign State. All attempts to disregard the generally accepted standards ofinternational relations have always met with a due rebuff and will continue to do so.We are entitled to ask: What encroachments on freedom and what defenceof liberty is in question, then? No one is encroaching upon this freedom. We arebeing threatened only because a peace treaty will be signed and the german democratic Republic will exercise its sovereign rights in the same way as anyother State.If certain Western Powers do not want to respect the sovereignty of theGerman Democratic Republic and if, on this basis, they believe they have the rightto resort to threats, that is the right of a highwayman, and prayers will not saveanyone from him. A highwayman can be beaten off only with a stick.We are told that the conclusion of a peace treaty with the German democratic republic is a unilateral act. But it is common knowledge that the Western Powers
have resorted more than once to unilateral decisions and then demanded that othersshould recognise those decisions as binding on them, too.I have already had occasion to say that the United States set an example whenit concluded a peace treaty with Japan, disregarding the position of the soviet union.  I cannot say that this is a good example, but it is a historical one.If the United States believed it had the right to sign a peace treaty with Japanwithout the Soviet Union, it must realise that the Soviet Union and the otherpeace-loving States have the right to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.We are not guided by the motives that were behind the United States&apos; signing of the separate peace treaty with Japan. We are speaking about the possibility of concluding a German peace treaty without the Western Powers, not because ofspite and not because we wish to harm in any way our allies in the war againstHitler Germany. We would have rejoiced much more at the prospect of concludinga peace treaty with both German States, jointly with all the participants in the anti-Hitler coalition.To-day, as in the past, we say that we are ready for talks. The memorandumhanded to President Kennedy in Vienna also says that we want to achieve a solutionof the German question in agreement with the Western Powers. This would be thebest thing to do to achieve the consolidation of peace in Europe, not through thestraining of our relations, but through the joint conclusion of a peace treaty.I repeat: We are for talks with the Western Powers on the question of a peace settlement with Germany. We are ready to start talks in order to strive honestlyand sincerely for an agreement and the conclusion of a peace treaty. But if anyonecounts on involving us in endless talks with a view to freezing the question of theGerman peace treaty, those gentlemen are deceiving themselves. We shall not be involved.     .There are not a few sober voices in the West, voices coming out in favour ofa peaceful solution to the German problem with due regard for the situation thatactually exists in Europe.I have read with great attention the article by the British Field-MarshalMontgomery. No one, I think, will suspect the Field-Marshal of being a communistmouthpiece his anti-communist reputation is solid and is recognised by everyone.But many of the things said by Lord Montgomery do not conflict with ourarguments.We, of course, cannot agree with certain theses of his article, but what he writesis in the main sensible. He proposes that all foreign troops be withdrawn from europe to within their own national frontiers, that foreign military bases bedismantled, that foreign troops be evacuated from Berlin, and so on. This coincideswith our proposals.Our position is not contradicted either by Lord Montgomery&apos;s statement thatthe Federal Republic of Germany should have access to West Berlin. We believethat the Federal Republic of Germany, like all other States, can have diplomatic,economic and other relations with West Berlin. But we have never recognised and shall not recognise the claims of the ruling circles of the Federal Republic ofGermany, who assert, without any grounds for so doing, that West Berlin is a partof their republic.Field-Marshal Montgomery has in his time been Deputy Supreme commander of the NATO armed forces in Europe. He has therefore been one of the championsand executors of the policy of strength. To-day, like many other people who are able to judge and think soberly, he realises where the policy of strength leads.It would be a good thing if this was realised also by those who are nowshaping Western policy. That would be a big step forward and would make it possible to reach agreement among all the interested nations on a just and equitablebasis.Certain organs of the Western Press claim that by its proposals on the Germanquestion the Soviet Union wishes to upset the existing equilibrium in Europe. Itsuffices to so much as glance at the Soviet proposals in order to see that theseassertions hold no water. We propose precisely to legalise what has taken shapeas a result of the war to recognise the actual state of affairs in Europe and to conclude a peace treaty with the two German States.
Let Western Germany, which is now a member of the NATO military grouping,remain in that bloc. Let the German Democratic Republic remain a member ofthe Warsaw Treaty organisation, which the socialist States were compelled to conclude as a counterbalance to the North Atlantic bloc. Let the situation remain as it is until the sides reach agreement on the liquidation of military blocs.The Soviet Union and its friends want only one thing to consolidate peace and improve the atmosphere in Europe. We want nothing else no acquisitions,no conquests. But no threats will stop us in our striving for peace. It is best thatthe Western gentlemen should learn this once and for all.We want peace and friendship with all nations, regardless of the social system which exists in this or that State. We want peace and friendship with the UnitedStates, though the way many questions are understood in our two countries isdiametrically opposite.I have already said that my meeting and talks with the United States President,Mr. Kennedy, in Vienna were useful inasmuch as they helped to obtain better understanding of several important international questions. Such meetings willbe useful in the future too, because the problems arising in international relationscannot be solved without meetings of Government leaders. This can be achieved,of course, only when the statesmen strive to find mutually acceptable decisions fordisputed questions through talks and not through the pursuance of a policy of strength, a policy of military threats.We have declared and continue to declare ourselves in favour of the expansionof contacts in different spheres between the Soviet Union and the Western Powers.We regard as useful the reciprocal visits of scientists, business men, cultural figures and artists. We are ready to expand such contacts because they help people ofdifferent countries to get to know each other better. A useful discussion betweenSoviet journalists and representatives of the American Press took place on theAmerican television a few days ago, for instance. Our journalists were afterwardsreceived by President Kennedy. We greatly value the fact that President Kennedyhas received our journalists and talked to them, just as somewhat earlier he talkedwith a big group of other Soviet journalists.All these contacts contribute to better understanding and the improvement of relations between our two countries and we want this line to continue in the future.Comrades, the visit to the Soviet Union of the Government delegation of the democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by Comrade Pham Van Dong and theexchange of views we have had on basic international questions, are an important contribution to the consolidation of fraternal friendship and co-operation between our two countries, to the further cohesion of the entire socialist camp, to the consolidation of world peace.The Soviet people greatly value the fraternal relations existing between our two peoples and we are convinced that these relations will develop and growstronger every day for the good of the peoples of our two countries.Moscow and Hanoi are separated by huge distances; yet in spite of this weare close to each other. The interests of the Vietnamese people are near and dearto the Soviet people, because they are the interests of comrades and brothers in thecommon struggle. That is why the Soviet people are welcoming with such cordialityand warmth your delegation of representatives of the Vietnamese people, who areclose to us owing to our common goals in the struggle for socialism, for communism,for a peaceful life on earth.Unanimity of views and goals and the community of our interests are aninexhaustible source for the strengthening and development of our friendship.We wholeheartedly wish the fraternal Vietnamese people further successeson the road to the building of socialism, on the road to the peaceful unification oftheir homeland.Long live the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the Soviet and theVietnamese peoples!May the mighty community of socialist States grow and develop!Long live world peace!
ANNEX GREPORT BY HER MAJESTY&apos;S AMBASSADOR IN MOSCOW OF his private CONVERSATION WITH Mr. KHRUSHCHEV ON 2nd JULYMr. Khrushchev attended the Royal Ballet first night yesterday with Messrs.Brezhnev, Mikoyan, Kosygin, Furtseva, Gromyko and Mrs. Khrushchev. he invited me and my wife to his box and over supper, during both the long intervalsand for an hour after the performance, he spoke to me on the German question.It was clear that this had been his main object in attending last night&apos;s performance,although he also spoke warmly of the company. His manner was friendlythroughout as befitted the occasion, but he did not mince words and his obviousintention was that I should convey a very serious, solemn and personal warning to Her Majesty&apos;s Government and personally to the Prime Minister, who hethought really understood the dangers in the German problem, as perhaps didPresident Kennedy. He said he owed the Prime Minister a hunting expedition.He still hoped he would be able to invite him to one this winter, but this wouldnot be possible if we had broken over Berlin and were perhaps shooting eachother instead of elk.2. Mr. Khrushchev began by taking up a remark of mine about the soviet trade Fair, which I said I should be seeing this week. The Soviet Governmentwanted the best trade, cultural and other relations with the United Kingdom aswith other Western countries, including former enemies like Germany, Italy and japan, but the West was now threatening to cut off trade and even go to warif the Soviet Government signed a peace treaty. The balance of forces in theworld had changed and the Soviet Union, which was threatening no one, wouldnot bow to Western threats. He was very caustic then and later about general de Gaulle&apos;s withdrawal of one division from Algeria when the Soviet Union couldmobilise 300 divisions. (&quot; It might however help the Algerian people to wintheir freedom sooner.&quot;) If other countries strengthened their military forces inGermany, the Soviet Union would do the same and could always move forces to be in position to protect the territory of its ally, the D.D.R. But in any casemodern wars would be fought with nuclear weapons, 10 of which could destroyFrance or for that matter the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union (and also theUnited States) would no doubt lose tens of millions, but the Soviet Union wouldcertainly go to war if the Western Allies tried to force their way through to west berlin after the Soviet Union had signed a peace treaty with the D.D.R. Itwould, however, be ridiculous for 200 million people to die over 2 million Berliners.3. Mr. Khrushchev had referred to the Prime Minister^ recent statement(presumably that of 27th June) as a threat, but argued that it had probably beenmade under pressure and in order to make a show of Western unity. I told himhe was much mistaken. The Prime Ministers statement had represented theviews of the overwhelming majority of the British people. We were threateningno one (indeed the boot was on the other foot) but we were firmly determined tocarry out our obligations to defend the freedom of the West Berliners (I addedin reply to Mr. Mikoyan a First Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Council of ministers that we had no other aims or interests in Berlin) and to resist any attempt to deprive us of our rights in Berlin. However, the Prime Minister had laid equalemphasis upon our readiness to negotiate. Since President Kennedy and Mr.Khrushchev had also spoken of negotiation, should we not concentrate uponfinding a mutually acceptable basis for this instead of interpreting each otherspositions as threats? For example, the Foreign Ministers had made some progressin 1959, but subsequent events had halted us. Could we not, as the Prime minister had suggested, see whether we could not take matters up again from that point?I added that I myself and many people in the United Kingdom could not understand why the Soviet Union should insist at such admitted risks upon raising these issues now, although we and the Soviet Union had lived with the present Germanand Berlin situations not unsuccessfully for many years and incidentally, allincreased our prosperity and living standards throughout this period. What was so wrong now from the Soviet point of view? We all wanted a real Germansettlement, covering reunification, but Mr. Khrushchev himself had volunteeredthat this was not now possible. Why then not avoid all threats and the dangerof war by leaving things as they were?59324c
4. Mr. Khrushchev at once agreed that negotiation was desirable, but noton the 1959 basis, which he dismissed categorically as no longer applicable to thepresent situation. As regards my other questions; 16 years was too long a period to maintain a provisional post-war arrangement. The world must settle down.Only the German question really divided the Soviet Union from the western powers. Of course we had different social systems but these were ideologicalissues which need not lead to inter-State quarrels. He maintained that only theabsence of a German settlement prevented a stable peace, which would lead to increased trade and the improvement of relations between East and West. Germanreunification was out of the question (here Mr. Khrushchev spoke verycontemptuously of Dr. Gerstenmeier&apos;s recent Bundestag statement). The Westwould never accept the communisation of the Federal Republic. Nor would theSoviet Union allow the D.D.R. to be absorbed in a capitalist Federal Republic.It was also obvious that neither the United Kingdom nor France nor even president kennedy wanted a reunified Germany, which would mean war sooner or later.As to the Oder-Neisse frontier, General de Gaulle had accepted it publicly andMr. Khrushchev was sure that neither we nor the Americans (nor for that matterDr. Adenauer himself) really wanted to change it. What was therefore holdingthe West back from the reasonable course of signing peace treaties with bothGerman States, excepting the fact that our ally Dr. Adenauer &quot; that evil man &quot;now decided Western policy and was working to poison relations still furtherbetween the West and the Soviet Union? I intervened in defence of Dr. Adenauer,and Mr. Khrushchev modified his attack to the extent of admitting that he wouldrather have Dr. Adenauer in power than Herr Brandt, the Governing Mayor of berlin, and that he had the authority to enable him to negotiate if he chose to do so.5. Mr. Khrushchev continued that what really divided us over germany was not so much the issues themselves, on which we were at heart agreed, asquestions of prestige and in our case the fact that we were allowing Dr. Adenauerto dictate Western policies. The Soviet Government (and here Mr. Khrushchevappealed to his colleagues for confirmation) having decided definitely that peace treaties or a peace treaty must be signed this year, had given most careful thought to safeguarding Western prestige. Hence their proposal, which was sincerelymeant, that West Berlin (not, he was careful to add, the whole of Berlin) should bea free city, preserving its social and economic system and its ties with the West(&quot; after all why should the Warsaw Pact countries with nearly 300 millioninhabitants, want another 2 million unwilling citizens &quot;) and with guarantees throughthe presence of troops of the three Western Powers and of the Soviet Union. Theyhad decided not to press for the inclusion of all Berlin within the D.D.R. but theSoviet Union had its own prestige problems. Since its strength and general positionwere at least equal to those of the West, the Soviet Union could not tolerate thatthe Western Powers (or rather Dr. Adenauer, through them) should, in effect,prohibit her on pain of military counter-measures from regularising her relationswith her ally, the D.D.R., 16 years after the war had ended, as the Western powers had done long ago with Japan and with the Federal Republic, regardless of Sovietinterest. Of course it would be preferable that the position should be regularisedby general peace treaties. But since the West still seemed reluctant, the SovietGovernment would sign their own treaty with the D.D.R. and no Western threatswould hold them back from this.6. I said that no one could stop the Soviet Government from signing sucha treaty and therefore there was no question of threats in this context. But wewere concerned with the possible consequences to us of such action we were inBerlin as of right and to fulfil certain obligations (I reminded Mr. Khrushchev ofthe European Advisory Commission agreements and of the withdrawal of Westerntroops from what was now the D.D.R. to the Elbe when we entered Berlin) and wemust also retain our rights of access to Berlin. A Soviet treaty with the D.D.R.could not extinguish those rights, nor make them dependent upon the D.D.R. I did not wish to question Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s sincerity over his Berlin free cityproposal, but neither we nor the West Berliners wanted any change in the presentposition. The freedom of Berlin depended upon freedom of access and under theSoviet proposals, we were left to arrange this not even under a Soviet guarantee,but with the D.D.R., with whom we had had no dealings hitherto. I did not thinkthat, were the roles reversed, Mr. Khrushchev would put his own troops in suchan uncertain position. Nor would such an arrangement give confidence to publicopinion in West Berlin or elsewhere, and without such confidence Mr. Khrushchevcould hardly achieve his objective of regularising and stabilising the situation.
7. Mr. Khrushchev said I had not fully grasped the Soviet position. Theydid not question our rights stemming from the war and post-war agreements ofoccupation and access under present circumstances. But these rights were onlyvalid until the signature of a peace treaty. Once the Soviet Union had signed a peace treaty with the D.D.R., as she fully intended to do, this would terminate thestate of war throughout the whole territory of the D.D.R., including of course theland and air corridors to Berlin and indeed, strictly speaking, in Berlin itself, since this was within the territory of the D.D.R. The Soviet Union would not imposeany blockade upon West Berlin, including Western forces there, nor would sheattack them. But in the absence of any Western signature of a peace treaty or ofsome other agreed arrangement, access to West Berlin through what would thenbe the territory and air-space of the D.D.R. could only be permitted under normalinternational law, i.e., by arrangement with the D.D.R. Any Western attempt to push troops or aircraft through without D.D.R. agreement would be regarded bythe Soviet Union as an act of war, and she would support the D.D.R. in resistingany such acts by force. The Western Powers were so preoccupied with their ownso-called obligations and prestige that they failed to see the obvious fact that anyother attitude would constitute an intolerable blow to Soviet prestige.8. There were fortunately some sensible voices in the West SenatorFulbright, Mr. Lippman, Field Marshal Montgomery and Mme. Tafhouis werecommended in looking for another name Mr. Khrushchev sent for his briefcaseand revealed that he had personally read and annotated a very large number ofrecent important and less important Western statements reported by Tass.9. It was then getting very late and I said that while I was sure we cannot accept many of Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s assertions, more especially as regards our rightsand obligations, I welcomed his frankness and would convey his views as faithfullyas I could to the Prime Minister, whom I hoped to see shortly in London.Meanwhile, it seemed to me that there was a real and potentially very dangerousmisunderstanding on who was threatening whom; I was reminded of the Frenchsaying that&quot; This animal is very dangerous because it defends itself when attacked &quot;,Mr. Khrushchev asked me to assure the Prime Minister that he had not intendedto make any threats, but only to remove any possible misunderstandings. TheSoviet Government would prefer a settlement by agreement and were convincedthat their proposals did not infringe the interests or prestige of the Western Powersnor the freedom of West Berlin. It was only if, under West German pressure, were fused to join in a peace treaty and then resorted to force to maintain ourselves in Berlin, that the Soviet Union would meet force with force. However, he remained confident that the Prime Minister and President Kennedy andGeneral de Gaulle, all of whom were wise and reasonable men, would join in an effort to find a solution &quot; by the way of reason &quot;. But threats and military measuressuch as the return of United States bombers to French bases, of which he had read, would only make a difficult situation worse.10. At one point I had said that I assumed Mr. Khrushchev still consideredthat nothing much could or should be done until after the German elections andhis own Congress. I did not get a very clear reply, since we had to return to theballet after he had complained, but not apparently in all seriousness, about alwayshaving to wait for Western elections.11. Our conversation, to which Mr. Mikoyan and Mr. Gromyko, the SovietMinister for Foreign Affairs, only had occasionally made minor contributions andat which Mrs. Khrushchev and my wife had also been present throughout,concluded rather incongruously with good wishes not only to the Prime Minister,but also to the members of the Royal Ballet. After making every allowance forthe impression Mr. Khrushchev no doubt intended to make upon me, I came away with the very definite feeling that he has made up his mind and will not easily be deterred by any action open to us from the particular course he has chosen, whichin his eyes combines at least an appearance of reasonableness with forcing theWest to make the first overt military move. The issue on which he seemed to feelmost strongly was that the Soviet Union (with her allies) was now at least on anequality with the West and that the situation in Germany and Berlin must be modified to reflect this fact, although not to such an extent as to destroy Westernprestige and so make war inevitable.Mr. Gromyko has since drawn my attention, on Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s instructions,to the main recent articles Mr. Khrushchev had in mind and with which he was insuch strong agreement.   They are Captain Liddell Harfs letter on the North
Atlantic Alliance and Berlin in the Sunday Times of 25th June and Mr. WaylandYoung&apos;s article in the Guardian of 30th June. I can well understandMr. Khrushchev&apos;s agreement with the former, despite its reference to his own&quot; insecure position &quot;, which incidentally was included in the Russian translationsent me by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.I omitted to report that Mr. Khrushchev also referred to stories of thewithdrawal of United States military dependants from Europe as attempts tofrighten the Soviet Union. He said it would take much more than this to frightenrevolutionaries who had fought without any arms and now had the most modernmilitary weapons.Mr. Khrushchev also referred at some length to the 1955 Geneva meeting.Although he was not very clear, the main points he seemed to be making were:(a) That Western positions on the priority and inter-connexion of such issues as Germany, disarmament and European security seemed to changevery frequently.(b) That the 1955 communique had not really committed the Soviet union to German reunification by free elections, as had been made clear by subsequent Soviet statements.On (a), Mr. Khrushchev suggested that European security was a very importantissue tied up with the German problem, but one which the West seemed to havebeen ignoring recently.July 1961.
