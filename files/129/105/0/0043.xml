C. (61) 93 copy NO.    &apos;   I11th July. 1961CABINETPQST OFFICE TARIFFSM^^2r.Sii^HSi.iy-^^?.-P2SiSl% st er. General.The financial performance of the Post 0:.fice in recent years has been good.   For the three years 1958-9 to 1960-61 we earned 8 per centor more on capital.   Wage rates and price increases in that period weremoderate enough to be absorbed without putting up charges.2.      The position is, however, changing, mainly because of more rapid wage increases.   Moreover, our total capital investment - andtherefore the surplus required to achieve a given return - rises con-siderably every year.   Unless substantial increases in charges areintroduced my return threatens to fall this year and next to some5-6 per cent - a reduction of  20-30 millions.3.      I have discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer myinvestment needs, which themselves are increasing because of the growing demand for Post Office services, especially on the telephone side.Plainly, our financial performance becomes all the more importantwhen we consider the need to finance a growing programme, and I must therefore raise tariffs by an amount which will restore the return toabout 8 per cent next year.   All this fits in with Government policy for nationalised industries announced last March.4.      I attach as an Annex a statement which I propose to make to the House    on 18th July.   The changes I am then proposing in PestOffice tariffs will yield  l6jr millions from tele-communications and 85 millions from posts in a full year.    They include an addition of 2 per annum to telephone rentals-  a doubling (to a maximum of  10)of the connection charge payable when a telephone is put in;  a 3d. onthe minimum charge for printed papers and newspapers;  and 6d. oninland parcels.   The changes proposed will be made by Regvdations subjectto Negative Resolution.5.      I seek the Cabinet&apos;s approval to the statement.J. R. B.General Post Office, S. C. 1.10th July, 1961-1-
annex draft STATEMENTMr. Speaker, with your permission and that of the House, Ishould like to make a Statement on Post Office tariffs.The last general increase in Post Office tariffs took place in1957.   Since then wage and price increases have added about  55 millions to our annual expenditure, despite which we have been able to earn a return on capital of about 8 per cent.   In the last six months, however,these cost increases have been particularly heavy:  our wage level isnow about  20 millions a year higher than it was a year ago and this is bound to change the picture.For two principal reasons I have now decided on certain tariffincreases.   The first is this.   The demand for telephones and the pressure on the system is such that our investment must be augmented if efficientservice is to be given.   I expect to spend about  6 millions more this yearand  12 millions more next year than was previously contemplated.   Asthe Government made clear in the White paper on &quot;The Financial andEconomic Obligations of the Nationalised Industries&quot; (Cmnd. 1337) thisinvestment can be justified only if it produces an adequate return.   Iam sure it is right to restore the return on our assets in 1962-63 tothe level of the past three years.   I am equally sure that it is soundpolicy for the Post Office progressively to self-finance their  owndevelopment.The second reason is that too many Post Office services arerun at a loss and should be put on a more economic basis, partly because this is right in itself but mainly because it is likely to leadto improved  service.The price increases on which I have decided apply either to services running at a loss or to services which produce an inadequatereturn on capital and where there is a high investment demand.The principal increases are:-Telephones(a) Rentals for telephone exchange lines will be increased by 2 per annum.(b) Connection charges for exchange lines will be doubled.(c) Rentals for private switchboards, extensions and privatecircuits will be increased.I propose also to change the basis of charging for telephonesmore than three miles from the exchange.   The excess mileage rentalwill be abolished, but for new subscribers there will be an increasedinitial connection charge related to distance and new construction.
Inland Postage(a) The basic printed paper rate will be increased from 2d.to 2Id. , but at the same time I am proposing to introduce rebatesfor large users.(b) The basic charge for newspapers will be increased from 2jd.to 3d.(c) The charges for parcels will be increased by 6d. at all points.Details of the changes will be circulated in the Official Report.Increases in connection charges, the abolition of the excessmileage charge, and two other minor changes will take effect as from tomorrow.   The remaining telephone changes will become operative on 1st November.   The Postal changes will take effect on1st October.The heart of these proposals is that the Post Office should aim to finance development from their own resources and to satisfypublic demand on an economic basis.July, 1961-3-
