ECONOMIC GROWTH AND NATIONALEFFICIENCYPART IGENERAL DISCUSSIONIntroductionIn the past year public interest in the rate of economic growth in this country has been intensified and it is necessary to consider more fully the questions to whichthis gives rise. Of particular significance is the effect of economic growth on other major aspects of policy, notably the level of public expenditure and the imperativeneed to restore the external financial position. Can our rate of growth supportpublic expenditure on the present scale? How far is growth compatible with a sound balance of payments, and if it is not, how can it be made to be so? Theseare the great questions in this sphere.2. As we see it, the &quot; question &quot; of economic growth comprises the perennialquestions of productivity, investment, wages and salaries, restrictive practices,competitiveness all of which contribute in one way or another to the final rateof growth of the economy. In that sense there is little that is new on the &quot; growthquestion &quot;; nevertheless, the surge of public interest gives an excellent opening for taking up these matters again in a new atmosphere with more hope of gainingacceptance of changes which may be needed; it may also be that more definiteemphasis on economic growth could act as a catalyst in other difficult issues ofpolicy.3. We have surveyed the issues involved and present this report which dealswith them under the following heads:(1) What is economic growth?(2) What are the facts of the British record in the 1950s and how does itcompare with other countries&apos; performances?(3) What aspects have recent discussions been concerned with?(4) Does economic expansion matter?(5) How does economic expansion fit in with the growth of demand and thebalance of payments?(6) What can the Government do about it?The Meaning of Economic Growth4. The &quot; economic growth &quot; or &quot; economic expansion &quot; of a nation, or thegrowth of its economic &quot; resources &quot;, is generally taken to mean the increase overa period of several years of its gross national product (G.N.P.) the total outputof goods and services (gross domestic product or G.D.P.) plus its net receipts ofproperty income from abroad calculated at a constant value of money. For themost economic decisions for example, on public expenditure, or employment policy, or taxation it is the aggregate G.N.P. that is relevant. Comparisons of.N.P. between countries, and over periods of time, are important as indicating ina general way the changes in relative economic, political and military power. but when we are considering long-term qualitative changes, or are comparing countries of different sizes, we must adjust for changes in population. For considering thestandard of living, it is G.N.P. per head of the population that is relevant: for considering productive efficiency, the criterion is the output of goods and servicesper worker. This may appear to be too simple to be worth emphasising, but manyof the published international comparisons ignore it altogether.5. In the United Kingdom the working population is growing by only about\ per cent, per year; so our growth of G.N.P. will depend mainly upon the growth of output per worker. When we are considering economic growth or economic expansion in this country, our attention must therefore be focused upon the output per worker.  It must be considered in a broad context, embracing not only the
familiar idea of productivity (or output per worker) in each manufacturing industry,but also that of productivity in transport, distribution, public administration and services of all kinds; the movement of labour and capital from low-productivityindustries, such as agriculture and cotton textiles, to high-productivity industries,such as engineering and chemicals; the yield on the total resources capital andlabour employed in production, and not simply that of labour; above all (anddecisive for this country) the deployment of the resources of labour and capital sothat they compete effectively both in world markets and in the United kingdom market itself producing the goods and services that the world wants at the prices atwhich it will buy them. Over a period of several years all these concepts arestatistically comprehended in the one figure of G.D.P. (or sometimes G.N.P.) perworker; and where we want a statistical measure this is the right one to use. But the broad idea is that of &quot; national efficiency &quot; in the widest sense, and this is the term thatis used here except where the technical statistical phrase G.D.P. per worker is appropriate.The British Record6. In the last decade the economic growth record of the United kingdom has been better than before the war; G.D.P. per worker employed grew at about per cent, per annum during the fifties, while in the inter-war period the figure was certainly less, possibly about \\ per cent.7. A second improvement, as compared with the inter-war period, is that capacity has been more fully utilised. The unemployment percentage since thewar has consistently been much lower and more stable than it was then, so thatresources have not been wasted by lying idle, and the human problems arising frommass unemployment are a thing of the past. &quot;The pre-war problem of massunemployment has gone and the problems of this country to-day are primarilythose of expansion and price stability&quot; (White Paper on Public Investment,November 1960, Cmnd. 1203). Furthermore, this is not the only respect in whichthe economy has been operating more efficiently. It has shown itself to be reasonably flexible in adapting to changes in the pattern of demand and ofproduction possibilities, as is demonstrated by the considerable redistribution ofthe labour force; but there is doubt whether it has in fact been adapting itselfquickly enough.Comparison of British and Other Countries&apos; Performance8. The reason for concern about the recent rate of growth of the UnitedKingdom is not that it is slower than in the past but that some other major countries have grown significantly faster, as the following table based on O.E.E.C. estimatesshows:Average Growth of G.N.P. per head of Employed Labour Force 1950-60(Per cent, per annum)5-1Germany.........      ...... -Netherlands       ...............Italy (1955-60)...............Norway   .....       ............France (1955-60)...............Belgium   ..................       &apos;United States     .........      -.....      united Kingdom ...        .......Canada    ...... 19. These comparisons must be interpreted with caution. Methods of estimating G.N.P. vary between countries. The relative position of the UnitedKingdom may have been improving during the fifties. In 1955-60 the rate of growth of G.N.P. per worker in Germany was slower than in 1950-55, while inthe United Kingdom it has remained constant or even risen; nevertheless, the rateof growth of G.N.P. per worker is still much lower in the United Kingdom thanin Germany.
10. The fact that G.N.P. per worker has been growing faster in othercountries does not necessarily imply that the United Kingdom could achieve thesame rate. The United Kingdom started with a higher level of G.N.P. per workerthan most of the fast-growing countries. Other countries in a similar position, suchas the United States and Canada, have also had a relatively low rate of growth.11. This is one instance of the general point that the underlying economic factors differ from one country to another. This point is worth making in more detail for Germany and France. In the case of the former, where the contrast is most marked, the following factors appear to be relevant:(a) In Germany there was still some under-employed capital and muchunemployed labour in the early fifties.(b) Germany had a relatively larger agricultural and handicraft sector (to release resources for more productive use elsewhere) and a relativelysmaller services sector (where productivity growth is limited).(c) The heavy immigration from East Germany constituted an extremelyvaluable addition to the labour force as it consisted largely of the mostmobile and productive groups in the population.(d) Defence expenditure and overseas aid, and the resulting overstrain on the economy, have been less in Germany than in the United Kingdom.12. In France, too, there were special circumstances. The French economy was largely stagnant in the thirties and even by 1950 industrial production wasscarcely higher than in 1929. In the last decade the technique of French industry has leaped forward; since there was so much ground to make up, it has been possibleto exploit latent potentialities in productivity.13. In general, therefore, a survey of the past record of growth here andabroad should not in itself necessarily be taken as an occasion for gloom. Butit does seem likely that we are not doing as well as we could, and certainly we arenot growing as fast as some of our major competitors. This has clear implications for the long-term political position of this country.Recent Discussions of Economic Growth14. The heightened anxiety about British performance has been manifest notonly in Parliament but also, for example, in the F.B.I. Conference at Brighton inNovember 1960 on the next five years and in the reactions to the P.E.P. Report on&quot;. Growth in the British Economy &quot; and the National Instituted Conference on french Planning in April.15. More detailed discussion of economic growth took place between january and March at three meetings of the Economic Planning Board and a meeting ofthe Interim Committee of the National Production Advisory Council for Industry.Throughout, these discussions concentrated on general topics, often indeed of much importance, but shied away from specific matters and individual cases affectingcosts and management. This was partly, perhaps, because of the federal nature ofthe F.B.I., B.E.C. and T.U.C., which speak on behalf of their constituents but arein no position to enter into binding commitments in their name; indeed, on morethan one occasion F.B.I. representatives specifically said that they spoke as individuals. Nevertheless, real concern was evident about the future developmentof the economy, and it was accompanied by a willingness to seek a constructiveapproach to general issues of economic policy.16. Among particular points of significance made by industrial representativesduring these discussions were the following:(a) The employers laid much stress on the shortage of manpower, the onlyrealistic remedy being to increase productivity; a real drive was needed in order to achieve this, supported by increases in labour-savinginvestment and more backing from the trade unions. Employers alsoshowed a good deal of frustration with &quot; stop-and-go &quot; policies; andstressed the need for assurances that would enable investment to go ahead uninterrupted, e.g., by stating that investment allowances wouldnot be withdrawn for a given period.
SECRET(b) The trade unions&apos; representatives were keen to secure increases in productivity, but when it was achieved in particular industriesredundancies often followed; hence, they considered that someprogramming of economic growth, including central planning of capital investment, was needed to ensure that new investment was properlyutilised. They were aware that some industries would have to contract,and that the consequent transfers of skill must be attended to. Increasedco-operation to secure greater productivity would mean instilling agreater feeling of security of employment than operatives had to-day.While on the whole they were less apprehensive about the risks ofunemployment than in the past, their confidence was shaken from timeto time. More emphasis on economic growth, with a positive policy to support it, should be accompanied by firm assurances aboutemployment.(c) On both sides there were some who wished to see an overall plan established with a higher rate of growth than had been achieved in recent years.Targets should be laid down and steps taken to see that they wereimplemented. (The T.U.C. side specifically asked for a programme.)If necessary, some were prepared to see some inflation in order to stimulate economic growth; on this view the Government should havea programme, and calculated risks should be taken in order to achieveit since a rise in prices might be prevented by the rise in productivity.17. From (a) and (b) it is plain that there is a good deal of genuine concernand appreciation of at least some of the issues, though the partial interest inproposals outlined in (c) suggest that no extensive thought has been given to whatis involved.Reasons for Considering &quot; National Efficiency &quot; Important18. We now address ourselves to the substance behind these internationalcomparisons and the recent discussions at the Economic Planning Board and the interim Committee. Of themselves they are not very good reasons for devotingattention to the subject; there is now no obvious hardship arising from anyinadequacy in the rate of increase of G.D.P. per worker and it can be argued not without some justification that the present agitation about growth would not be nearly so noisy had it not been for the activities on an international scale ofeconomic statisticians. It would, however, be unwise in our view to dismiss thematter as lightly as this.19. Other things being equal, a faster rate of economic growth is clearly moredesirable since it means that Britain would move more rapidly into a state of having an increased flow of goods and services available for all purposes. Althougheconomic growth sets up stresses in the economy, it is also true that many major political and social issues are more easily solved in a fairly rapidly growingeconomy: the edge is taken off strife over &quot; shares &quot; if the total is growing andthere is confidence that it will go on growing.20. Under certain conditions a slow rate of growth of &quot; national efficiency &quot;may weaken Britain&apos;s international competitive position and thus produce constantstrain in the balance of payments and a threat to the maintenance of the sterlingsystem. The advantages which Germany and France had in their growth recordin the 1950s sprang partly, and perhaps largely, from the greater adaptability oftheir economies to economic change: moreover, although the increase in output per worker in the United States was no greater than in Britain, the United Statesenjoys the great advantage of a steadily growing population which enables workers to be drawn more readily into growing sections of the economy.21. Faster growth elsewhere suggests prima facie that the British economycould grow faster if we had the knowledge and the will to set the right way about it. A high or a rising rate of increase of &quot; national efficiency &quot; has never yet been an explicit aim of policy in the same way as full employment or price stability:growth has been left to emerge from the economic environment by natural processes.The high level of demand has been part of employment policy but there may be other ways of promoting economic growth which have not yet been fully exploited.Whichever way is tried and these we discuss later in this report-it would beoptimistic to suppose that &quot; national efficiency &quot; could be improved substantiallywithout some sacrifices: for example, an increase in investment would mean
reducing consumption. Again, the increase in exports needed to strengthen thebalance of payments without which economic expansion will be impossible willcall for sacrifices in the domestic economy.22. For these reasons we conclude that the problem of economic growthshould be taken seriously, even though some of the more flesh-creeping arguments for doing so may be readily discounted. The issue is important in its own right:and the public interest in the matter shows that they would be responsive to a lead on the right lines. We think, therefore, that the least we should do is to lookcarefully into the nature and conditions of economic growth as they apply to Britain,so as to discover whether by moderate or reasonable measures the rate of expansioncould be speeded up. Even though these measures might involve some damage to existing practices and interests, the development of the economic situation and ofinformed opinion may make acceptable sacrifices or changes of policy which wouldnot have been considered in the past.&quot; National Efficiency &quot;, Demand and the Balance of Payments23. Experience of the 1950s has shown conclusively that merely to increasedemand in the short-run in relation to the resources available does not increase&quot; national efficiency &quot;. Throughout these years resources were very fully employedby international standards, with unemployment in Britain never rising above 2 percent., except for very short periods. When the existing resources are fully used,the rate of growth of G.D.P. must slow down to the rate of growth of capacity toproduce including here both the capacity of factories and the capacity to provideservices like transport and distribution.24. As the degree of utilisation nears the physical limit of output, stressesappear, cost and prices rise faster and imports rise sharply relative to production.The increase in the level of activity and income brings greater imports, while thedevelopment of shortages both of final products and of intermediate goods may cause a large increase in imports in order to cover marginal requirements. Deliverydelays increase, competition is reduced and wages and salaries rise owing to thediminished willingness of employers to refuse wage increases. At the same time,the great ease of selling in the home market removes both the incentives onproducers to seek export outlets for their products and their ability to do so owingto the rise in domestic costs. The domestic boom brought about by increasing demand worsens the balance of payments and builds into the economy a strongtendency to cost inflation. The strength of home demand, coupled with the increasing difficulty of selling abroad, have combined to create a climate of opinion in which moderation of claims by trade unions and a firm response to them by employers have been increasingly at a discount. As the process gathers momentum,leap-frogging and relativities become the main criteria, and the conception ofwages and salaries having any relationship to the increase in the national averageof G.D.P. per worker becomes submerged.25. The effect of maintaining demand at the levels experienced in the 1950shas been shown primarily through the chronic difficulties in the balance of payments.Whatever the merits or demerits of particular policies, or the effect of outsidecircumstances like the Korean War or United States fluctuations, we have to startfrom the fact that the balance of payments is critically weak with inadequatereserves and very large short-term claims resting upon this country. This weakexternal position limits greatly the field for manoeuvre, and the attainment of external solvency must be kept in the forefront in policy formulation in the nextfew years. We must emphasise that the weakness is fundamental, and even ifthere is a considerable improvement in the next year, the effort would have tocontinue for several years successively before we could feel reasonably safe inrespect of the balance of payments.26. In order to restore the balance of payments a sustained effort over aperiod will be required to consume fewer resources at home, leaving more availablefor exports. This does not mean cutting down the absolute amount used at homeso much as checking the rate of increase of private and public consumption andcorrespondingly making sure that a rising proportion of the national product goesinto exports. These exports can only be sold if they have a competitive advantageor edge as compared with the exports of other countries. No one can forecastprecisely what goods will be sold this can only be learned from sales in answer to demands of the market. The Government cannot direct resources to exports,and even if it could, this would not necessarily mean that the goods would be sold.SECRET59251 c
The Government^ Role29. The scope for action is wide. As we pointed out in paragraph 4, future economic expansion in the United Kingdom will depend primarily on the rate of growth of G.D.P. per worker over the economy as a whole, i.e., &quot; nationalefficiency &quot;. There are often misconceptions about this arising from the mistakenidea that output-per-worker matters only in the production of goods. This is indeed the clearest and simplest case, but it is by no means the whole picture becausethe output of goods contributes only about half of the gross national product, andemploys only half of the total working population. The activities of services liketransport and distribution are also of great significance to national efficiency; theyform an integral part of the economic process without which the goods producedcould not be sold and used. Although output per worker is more difficult to measure in this sphere than in production, in principle the concept applies just the same. Ifthe efficiency of transporting and distributing goods can be raised in relation to thenumbers employed &quot; national efficiency &quot; is improved. Similar considerations applyto the activities of public authorities; here, of course, the measurement of output perworker is exceedingly difficult, but it is equally true that the way in which they areoperated greatly influences &quot; national efficiency &quot;.30.  The relative importance of each of these groups at the present time maybe seen by the output which each contributed to the gross domestic product in 1959:Group A   million          Percent.Manufacturing          ...      ......      ...... 7,492Agriculture, forestry, fishing.........      ... 874Mining and quarrying        ............ 664Gas, electricity, water         ............ 553Construction   .................. 1,190Total production     .........       -   10,773 52Group BTransport and communications     ......... 1,640Distributive trades    ...      ............ 2,585Insurance, banking, finance and other services      ... 2,840Total................       -     7,065 34Group CAdministration, defence, education, health...... 2,057Other activities         ......      ...      ...... 987Total...............       -     2,818 14Gross domestic product     ...... 20,656        100The only way in which this result can be brought about is by increasing our&quot; national efficiency &quot;.&apos;27. If however by more efficient direction and use of resources we couldspeed up the growth of G.D.P. per worker without permitting an excessive levelof demand, this would be favourable to the balance of payments. It is true that imports would probably grow faster: but at the same time, improvements in&quot; national efficiency &quot;, the expansion of capacity and the development of newproducts would assist the growth of exports. It seems likely that the greater the pace of such developments the stronger will be these effects on the balance of payments,always provided that they are accompanied by appropriate financial policies. one reason is that the faster G.D.P. per worker grows, the more favourable will be thedevelopment of the United Kingdom price level relative to that of the rest of theworld. This will both strengthen Britain&apos;s position in markets abroad and makeimported products less competitive. A second reason is that an economy whichis growing rapidly and producing a steady stream of innovations can adjust moreflexibly to meet changes in trade opportunities and seize the lead in new kinds oftrade. Competitiveness, in other words, depends upon adaptability and technological advance as well as upon the general price level. Thirdly, rapid growth breeds confidence and enterprise in industry, which should make for abold attack upon overseas markets.28. To sum up: consideration of raising the long-term rate of growth of&quot; national efficiency &quot; must start from the fact that the external position is weak and the immediate prospect for it poor. Increased production by itself is not likelyto solve this critical balance of payments situation; to try to hasten it by increasingthe pressure of demand would soon be frustrated by a foreign exchange crisis. Butif growth is fostered by increasing &quot; national efficiency &quot; the same measures whichwould assist economic growth would also help to right the balance of payments.
31. From this it is clear that while improved use of labour and capacity inGroup A may be the largest source of increases in &quot; national efficiency &quot;, the efficient performance of Groups B and C in their use of resources will also be very important. In so far as more labour and capital are used in B and C there will beless for A. This does not mean that there is something wrong about using resources in Groups B and C: but it does mean that efficient and economical use of resources in them is just as important as in Group A. This is of particular significance in an economy like Britain&apos;s where the advance in the standard of living calls for increasing use of resources in Groups B and C. (This grouping of A, B and C is, ofcourse, a functional economic grouping. The division between the public sector andthe private sector is not precisely the same. The public sector appears in A, in gas,electricity and mining; it appears in B in roads and railways; and of course in C in defence, education, health, &amp;c.)32. In formulating a policy, the central fact from which we start is that the achievement of full employment in the post-war period and of numerous socialchanges, e.g., the development of education and health services, has not beenmatched by nearly so rapid a change in the attitudes of people and institutionstowards habits of work, business practices and management. Some progress hasindeed been made, but there are still many branches of economic activity where the effective use of both labour and capital is severely hampered. This limits their rapidadaptability to change and checks the advance of &quot; national efficiency &quot;.33. This is damaging. If this country is to improve its position againstcompetitors, the modernisation of our market economy needs to be accelerated bya revolution of attitudes parallel to the revolutionary achievement of full employment and social services. In this revolution the Government has a part toplay by striving to remove obstacles to the effective operations of a market economy in the production of goods and services. This does not imply re-examining the ideas which have come to be generally accepted in the last 10 years about the properrole of Government in education, health and national insurance; nor need it involvesuch politically contentious questions as the scope of the nationalised enterprises,although it would mean the firm prosecution of the policy indicated in the recentWhite Paper on &quot; The Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised industries &quot; (Cmnd. 1337) for giving the industries commercial freedom and settingthem the objective of earning a higher return on their investment.34. What is required is a much more thorough and far-reachingre-examination of impediments to efficiency than has been undertaken in the past.Some progress has been made (e.g., with the Restrictive Practices Act), but it hasbeen piecemeal and has never formed part of a comprehensive attempt to removeobstacles to efficiency over the economy as a whole. The need is for theGovernment to balance to a much greater extent than in the past the benefits and costs of particular policies, including not only those affecting public expenditure,but also all other action which affects incentives and the adaptability and pattern ofthe economy. At every stage the cost to the economy as a whole of existing arrangements or of a particular course of action needs to be brought out more clearlyand brought into focus when the final decisions are reached.The Example of Germany and France35. The methods adopted in Germany and France are sometimes proposed as models which Britain should consider. They differ considerably as is well known,the former going in for a very free market economy and the latter for a largeelement of dirigisme. Both have consistently achieved increases in &quot; nationalefficiency&quot; very much greater than Britain. As we have already noted(paragraphs 11 and 12) the circumstances in each country differ considerably from britain&apos;s, so they do not necessarily provide good guidance for policy here. InGermany the main reliance of policy has been on monetary and fiscal measures,leaving the industrial initiative to private enterprise. Aided by an ample labour supply until recently, comparatively weak trade union pressure, strong businessorganisation, a slightly under-valued currency and favourable depreciationallowances, industry has maintained a high rate of investment. Exports rose faster than internal demand and the Germans have attained a fast rise in &quot; nationalefficiency &quot; and big increases in output, which have kept ahead, of the rise in wagesand general consumer demand. The role of Government has been limited, andprimarily aimed in later years at checking the domestic pressure of demand and
(under constant pressure of demand) in reversing the constant tendency for the external reserves to rise.36. In France the essence of the plan is a series of discussions, industry by industry, about output, capacity and investment, taking in other aspects such asfinance and manpower which are relevant to these main themes. The nature ofthe discussions varies from industry to industry, but common to all is the participation of Government officials, representatives of management and workers as well as a fringe of experts and academics. The object is to arrive at an agreedforward view to which can be related the decisions, both in the public and private sector which will determine the subsequent outcome. (The Governments controlover sources of credit at favourable rates has been an important lever to get agreement.) The starting point in the discussions is a view of the prospects for the economy as a whole prepared by the Ministry of Finance and the PlanCommissariat; one of the purposes of the discussions is to ensure that sections ofthe plan are mutually consistent and with the projection for the whole economy.The final result is an agreed plan- the name used is economie concertee representing not merely a Government but a joint view. The process of jointworking out is of psychological value in developing community of outlook and mutual sympathy, which adds to business confidence: the official work on generalprospects provides a basis in which others have a good deal of confidence, and thisconfidence is also increased by the knowledge in each industrial sector that other important sectors are also working on the plan.37. There are certain objections to the French approach: it gives officialblessing to cartels; setting targets for industry may in the long run make theindustrial structure more rigid, especially where declining industries are concerned;it is also doubtful whether the planning mechanism will be able to go on working in the same way as the barriers with other Common Market countries are reduced;and the planning machine does little in itself to remove obstacles to nationalefficiency-it is significant that, for example, M. Rueff (one of the architects ofGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s stabilisation programme) has had to undertake a separatestudy of the numerous obstacles to efficient production arising from outdatedrestrictions on the French economy.38. Further study of German and French experience will be needed in orderto see how far such methods and experience furnishes examples which it would be useful to follow up in Britain. This is not something to be done hurriedly: thecommon argument &quot; they have grown much faster, follow their example &quot; is much too simple; not only have the circumstances of both countries differed from britain&apos;s, but so have their policies. There is no obvious example to copy.Conclusions39. Our conclusions on the policy which should be followed may besummarised as follows:(a) The first task is to eliminate or curtail obstacles to the growth of &quot; nationalefficiency &quot; and hence to the strengthening of the balance of payments.It is, in this sense, that we think economic growth matters. There ismuch improvement to be done.(b) In the rest of this report we&apos;put forward matters which we think shouldbe studied by Ministers with a view to action. The matters so identifiedall influence &quot; national efficiency &quot;. It is only in this way that Britaincan hope to make faster progress in the future.(c) We would not recommend taking the German or the French examples asa pattern, but there are aspects of both which are worth considering.(d) An important feature of the very diverse German and French experience has been their success in instilling an attitude of mind in business whichhas confidence in future growth and development of the economy. we certainly do not go so far as to say that this is lacking here in Britain,but the constant preoccupation with maintaining demand, and thefrustration at stop-and-go policies in the last three or four years,indicates that there is some lack of confidence which needs to be remedied. Similarly, labour shows a lack of confidence in growth by its retention of out-moded attitudes of mind towards change and the
need for rapid adaptability. Here, too, it would be wrong to be toosweeping, but the fact remains that there is suspicion and doubt whichinhibits the ready adaptation to changing demands which the situationrequired.(e) All or most of the fields which we identify for possible action in this report would call for &quot; difficult &quot; battles with vested interests. Many attitudesand customs inimical to &quot; national efficiency &quot; have been sanctified by long acquiescence. In general, gains from restrictions are concentratedwhile the losses are diffused and less noticeable, though nonethelessdamaging for that. If, therefore, a serious attack is to be made oninefficiency in the economy, it will be important that it should bemounted on a wide front, so that it can be seen to be a part of coherentpolicy designed to achieve a definite end, with no group being able to feel that it was being specially picked on; again, where incentives weregiven they would have to be seen to be part of a coherent whole.PART IIMATTERS FOR EXAMINATION40. In the following paragraphs we identify a number of matters which wethink should be studied by Ministers with a view to action. These matters are:Investment:  savings and investment (paragraph 47) and distribution ofinvestments (paragraph 54).Labour: labour reserves (paragraph 58) and training (paragraph 70).Wages and salaries (paragraph 73).Aid to industry (paragraph 79).Restrictive practices: business restrictive practices (including monopolies)(paragraph 84), re-sale price maintenance (paragraph 87), restrictive labourpractices (paragraph 93), restrictive practices created by the Government(paragraph 95).Tariffs (paragraph 98).Taxation (paragraph 101).Public expenditure (paragraph 103).Administration (paragraph 109).INVESTMENT41. We consider three aspects of investment its relation to growth; the levelof investment and particularly its financing; .and factors affecting its distribution.The Relation between Investment and Growth42. It is commonly argued that one factor which causes a high rate of growth in total output is a high ratio of gross investment to the G.D.P. There is something in this belief, but the matter is more complicated. Some investment, though wellworthwhile for other reasons, adds little or nothing to the G.D.P. as it is normallymeasured: the building of a new school is an example. Secondly, the relation ofcapital and output varies from one part of the economy to another: thus, a housecosting  3,000 to build may add less annually to the G.D.P. than an additionalmachine costing the same amount, but this does not mean that the house constitutes the poorer investment, for the life of the house is longer so that it contributes tothe G.D.P. for far longer. Thirdly, G.D.P. per worker will be raised not only byan increase in the stock of capital per worker but also by a fall in the average ageof the stock of capital. The newer capital equipment is, the more it will incorporateup-to-date techniques and generally be apt for its purpose. To raise the stock of capital per worker, it must grow faster than the labour force; to reduce the
average age of the capital stock, the increase of new capital must outweigh thescrapping of the old, i.e., the capital stock must he growing. Part of the explanation of differences in the rates of growth of G.D.P. per worker in different countries lies in differences between the rates of growth of capital stock, both in relation to changesin the labour force and absolutely. Unfortunately these changes are difficult to measure and the ratio of investment to G.D.P. is a poor substitute.43. We do not accept, therefore, the view that the ratio of investment toG.D.P. is an adequate basis for comparing one country with another; still lessis it in itself an adequate guide to policy. What is true is that a suitable increase in investment, by accelerating the growth of capital stock, will contribute to the growth of G.D.P. per worker.The Level of Investment44. During the 1950&apos;s fixed investment did, in fact, increase both absolutelyand in proportion to the G.D.P. At constant prices the total rose from  2,140million (15-3 per cent, of the G.D.P.) in 1950 to  3,490 million (19-3 per cent, ofthe G.D.P.) in 1960. While the G.D.P. rose (in real terms) by 3 per cent, a year,fixed investment rose by 6^ per cent, a year. Of total fixed investment in britain in 1960, 70 per cent, was in agriculture, fuel and power, manufacturing, transportdistributive and service industries, the remaining 30 per cent, being in dwellingsand services such as roads, schools, hospitals, &amp;c.45. Before considering the level of investment further we must draw attentionto an important limitation on our freedom of action. In the next few years thereis almost certain to be a sharp conflict between the rising demand for engineeringgoods and the requirements of exports. Recently, for example, the orders on hand for engineering capital goods have risen by 30 per cent, and order books arelengthening considerably. It would, therefore, be damaging to one of our mainlines of exports to take any steps which aggravated the conflict. In the long run,of course, expansion of our engineering capacity will solve the problem.46. The maintenance of a high level of investment means that it will benecessary to take positive steps to ensure that an adequate level of savings is forthcoming if inflationary pressure is to be avoided. Public authorities are already committed to heavy investment in roads, schools and hospitals, &amp;c, and anyfurther increases either which the Government wishes to bring about to furthergrowth and efficiency or which private industry initiates if it is in the mood to pushahead faster, will make this all the more imperative. This would mean that theGovernment would have to be readier than in the past to supplement a shortageof personal or company savings by raising bigger surpluses on revenue account inorder to restrict consumption and at the same time to foster savings by every possible means.47. Such a policy would hardly be popular, but it is an essential corollary of a high (and still more of an increasing) level of investment and must be recognised as such; it would be necessary to bring home to the public that a large volume of social investment together with big investment to foster growth and efficiencymeans that sacrifices must be made. Personal consumption would not actuallyhave to be reduced, but for a while it would grow less fast than in recent years inorder to grow faster thereafter. (A reduction in the rate of increase of personal consumption from 3 per cent, a year the rate achieved between 1952 and 1959 to 2 per cent, a year would make possible a rise of fixed investment 5 per cent,greater each year.) We identify the relationship of savings and investment as amatter requiring continuing attention.Distribution of Investment48. Experience in the .1950&apos;s is not wholly reassuring about the ability of either the public or private sector to avoid wasteful investment: in the former, the lack of effective policy for a period on road and rail investment and the over-commitment of resources to nuclear energy are examples of what have turned out to be misdirection of resources. Similarly, in the private sector, though theevidence is necessarily less clear, a study by the Board of Trade of the accounts of several public companies indicates that investment can also be misdirected there,judging by the profit record, and that this has probably resulted from indiscriminateploughing back.
49. There is no sovereign remedy for these failings. Mistakes there will inevitably be: the question is whether there are any changes in policy affectingenterprises, and habits and outlook on investment, which might set the bias in theright direction,; i.e., towards ensuring that investment by enterprises is adequatelytested by its earning capabilities in the market.; ,50. We have considered whether the wider use of discriminatory investmentallowances might provide a remedy, as is sometimes suggested, but we do hotthink that it would. Apart from other difficulties, the central Government; is unlikely to be able to make consistently sound judgments that one sort of investment is better for economic growth than another.51. The exploitation of the most rewarding investments by private industryis better secured through the operation of the market. But in present conditionsmost private sector investment is self-financed, and does not pass through themarket. In the years 1954-58 about 70 per cent, of the additional funds accruing to quoted companies as a whole came from reserve retentions and depreciationprovisions. If some firms over-invest in less profitable processes, it iscorrespondingly more difficult for other firms with more profitable processes to expand fast owing to the difficulty of obtaining new outside money. Ploughingback as a means of financing thus influences the pattern of investment (as well asthe behaviour of the Stock Exchange), promoting an increase in the size of companies, in some cases biassing investment in existing known activities, whether at home or abroad, and in other cases making possible diversification and thegrowth of the investment trust type of company.52. The scanty evidence available suggests a widely varying degree of success in self-financed investment. It cannot be satisfactory that the important means to growth offered by these funds should be at the easy disposal of managementssheltered from the competition of the capital market, and by accounting procedures and related conventions from the scrutiny of proprietors and experts.53. How to remedy this is a difficult question. One method of encouragingcompanies to distribute more of their profits, so that their investment was put tothe test of the market, would be to tax retained profits more heavily. A more modest proposal to secure more open decisions on the use of profits and closerscrutiny of investment plans would be to require companies to issue scrip againstretained profits over the average of a number of years. But any movement towardsmore distribution of profits runs the risk that some of the funds distributed maynot remain in the capital market but go to consumption, and the psychological effect on wage claims of larger dividend payments would need to be borne in mind:54. We identify the question of best securing that investment flows to the mostprofitable place as a matter calling for attention; it may perhaps be best dealt withamong the taxation questions discussed in paragraphs 98-101.LABOURFuture Working Population55. The working population will increase by only a small amount in the next decade. The Government Actuary&apos;s forecasts of the total population of theUnited Kingdom show a growth from 52,157,000 in 1959 to 53,236,000 in 1964 and54,324,000 in 1969, continuing thereafter at about one million every five years tothe end of the century. Out of the growth of 2,167,000 between 1959 and 1969,325,000 are expected to be children under 15, and 1,188,000 men over 65 andwomen over 60.56. Projections of the working population, taking account of recent trends in the age of school leaving, and the proportion of married women at work, showa growth in the working population of 750,000 between 1959 and 1969, but of this600,000 is expected to occur by 1964, as a result of the 1947 bulge in the birth rate,and only 150,000 in the second five years. If the statutory school leaving age is increased to 16 as recommended in the Crowther Report, the working population will actually fall between 1964 and 1969. It follows that part of any growth in productivity per head of the working population in the late 1960s will have to be devoted to meeting the needs of an expanding population rather than to raising the standard of living or improving the overseas position.
57. After taking account of the totally disabled, widows with young children and single women with elderly dependants, there is little reserve of unoccupiedlabour among men under 60 or single women under 45. Any increase in theworking population beyond that already projected must therefore come mainly from men over 60, single women over 45 and married women. The other main sourcewhich could be tapped to increase the working population consists of those justbeyond normal retiring age. Many of them are still fit and willing to continue work,but are prevented from doing so by rigid rules in their employers&apos; retirementschemes.58. If these groups are to be brought into the labour force, many factors wouldhave to be considered, including not only the impact of taxation, the national insurance system and of private pension schemes, but also the conditions ofemployment affecting them (e.g., arrangements for part-time work by marriedwomen). Some of these issues have been examined on several occasions in the pastdecade, without much effect. We identify the problem of bringing in these labourreserves as a matter requiring renewed attention. But while we think this isimportant, it should not be allowed to be a substitute for the more important question of making the best use of the existing labour force, which we discuss in thefollowing paragraphs.Mobility of Labour59. The mobility of labour between geographical regions and between different industries is already considerable: every year 450,000 workers are recorded as having moved from one region to another, and many more move unrecordedwithin regions. In the 1950s the industrial pattern of employment changedconsiderably; employment rose by 22 per cent, in metal and metal-using industries,19 per cent, in distribution (starting from a low level), and by 15 per cent, in food,drink and tobacco; it declined in agriculture (15 per cent.), textiles and clothing(12 per cent.) and mining (11 per cent.).60. It is not easy to judge whether this amount of movement, bothgeographically or industrially, is in fact adequate to the country&apos;s needs. On theone hand, labour turnover in industrial plants may be such as to raise managementcosts and cause a wasteful use of labour; for example in 1960 there were 3-1 millionengagements out of the 9 million employed in manufacturing industry. On the otherhand, the persistence of marked differences in unemployment rates between different areas (e.g., 3 - 2 per cent, in Scotland and 1 per cent, in London and theSouth-East in April 1960) suggests that geographical, mobility is still somewhatlimited. There are many factors influencing mobility of labour, some of which are referred to in paragraph 76; among others may be mentioned rent control whichtends to keep some workers in their present houses and discourages the building ofhouses for renting.Training of Labour61. With continued changes in the industrial structure and the emphasis onhe need for more change, there must be adequate opportunity for those whose skillsare less needed to have opportunities for re-training, and for the unskilled and semi-skilled to have opportunities for acquiring skills. This in turn leads on to the wider question of industrial training arrangements and how far they are adequate to ensure the supply of skilled manpower which is needed to maintain a proper rateof economic growth. We now turn to this subject.62. Except for brief periods of recession, shortages of most types of skilled labour have persisted throughout the post-war period and they are now to be foundeven in areas where general unemployment is comparatively high. The mainshortages (though by no means the only ones) are in the skilled engineering and building occupations which are, of course, of basic importance to the economy.There is little doubt that these shortages have impeded economic growth and theyare likely, unless remedied, to do so increasingly in the future. The experience ofindustry in the United States suggests that technological progress requires an increasing proportion of trained and technically qualified manpower in the working population, with a correspondingly smaller demand for unskilled and semi-skilled labour. As it is, the Ministry of Labour&apos;s figures show that the great majority ofunfilled vacancies require some degree of skill, while a high proportion of theunemployed are labourers.
Apprentices63. Industrial training is traditionally regarded as the responsibility ofemployers: the Governments role is supplementary and in practice has mainlyserved social rather than economic purposes. The normal method of training isthrough recognised apprenticeship, of which the Carr Committee Report (&quot; training for Skill &quot;) said in 1957: &quot; At its best the British apprenticeship system is at presentturning out skilled workers who are the equal of any in the world. Unfortunately,there are not enough of them. The number of apprentices needs to be increased... .&quot;(p. 6). One reason for this is the necessity of providing worth while employment opportunities for the abnormally large number of school-leavers now entering thelabour market as a result of the post-war &quot; bulge &quot; in the birth rate. At the sametime, industry has a unique opportunity of augmenting its skilled labour force; insome industries the intake of apprentices has been insufficient even to maintain this.The number of boys getting apprenticeships rose from 93,000 in 1958 to 103,000 in1960, but further substantial increases are needed this year and next to keep pace with the &quot; bulge&quot;. Strenuous efforts are being made by the Government, inco-operation with both sides of industry, to achieve this, but it is proving an uphilltask.64. Merely to increase the number of apprentices is not enough. The quality of their training must be improved and adapted to modern conditions; the traditional five-year apprenticeship is not necessarily the right pattern for to-day.There is a need to move towards more broadly based training which will enablethe worker to practice a range of related skills rather than one narrowly specialisedcraft. This is important not only from the point of view of occupational mobility,but as a means of weaning skilled workers away from a restrictionist attitude onentry into the skilled occupations.65. Release of young people for further education depends upon the willingness of the employer. At present one in three of the boys aged between 15and 18 at work and one in fourteen of the girls get such releases with pay for one day a week, mostly in connexion with their industrial training. A few follow blockrelease courses in which the days on which they would usually get release for further education are bulked into one continuous period; this arrangement clearly haseducational advantages, but it calls for more rearrangement of work than dayrelease. So far as these arrangements relate to general education, the benefits to the economy are long-term, but the extension of release for vocational purposes wouldbe of direct help in improving industrial training.Training of Adults66. An increased intake of apprentices will, however, have little effect onthe supply of skilled labour for some years and the question arises whether moreeffort should be made to retrain adult skilled workers no longer required indeclining industries, or unskilled workers. To some extent this goes on now andit will be desirable to continue and even develop this in areas like Tyneside andClydeside with a declining shipbuilding industry. During the bulge years, whileso much effort has to be made to induce industry to increase its intake of apprentices, it will be necessary to consider how far it would be possible to run a campaign which might be felt to be inconsistent with it for simultaneouslyincreasing adult training. As against this, it is likely to be necessary, and as it would call for a complete review of existing attitudes to training by Government,employers and workers, an early start might have to be made. (One of the reasons why some skilled crafts in declining industries are so tenacious of their accustomedpractices is that there is now little opportunity for a skilled worker to change hiscraft, and even if he can, he suffers a big loss of wages in the meantime. It is hardlysurprising that change is sometimes resisted.)67. The Carr Committee reaffirmed the traditional attitudes towardsresponsibility for training: &quot; We consider that, as a general principle for the future,the existing division of responsibility between Government and industry for theeducation and training of apprentices should be maintained. The efforts ofGovernment should be directed to the expansion and improvement of the facilitiesfor technical education, while due responsibility for the industrial training of apprentices should rest firmly with the industry &quot; (p. 6). Although this refers toapprentices, the same attitude applies to training adults.   There is a marked
WAGES AND SALARIES71. During the 1950s output per man rose by about 2 per cent, a year on average. Between 1948 and 1958 the average annual increase in wages and salariesper head of the civilian labour force was 6J per cent. During 1958 and 1959 therate of increase fell to 2\ and 4f per cent, respectively, but during 1960 the risein earnings per head accelerated again, and in the second half of the year earningswere 5\ per cent, higher than in the second half of 1959. This carries with it serious consequences for the immediate future, for it means that considerable increases in prices are in the pipeline now, and we appear to be facing a further series of wage claims before the consequences of the 1960 increase have been fully felt.contrast here between the large sums spent on general technical educationtogether with the improved facilities freely available and the haphazard facilities,often hedged about with restrictions, for training of labour.68. We are by no means sure that the division of responsibility approved bythe Carr Committee provides sound guidance for the future. While clearly itwould be both impracticable and undesirable for training to be taken entirely outof the hands of industry and carried out solely in technical colleges and government training Centres, the present system seems inadequate under modern conditions and there is a strong case for saying that the Government ought to play a more positive role than it has done hitherto. This principle has recently been endorsed by Ministers; so far as apprentices are concerned, a particular proposal which isnow being examined is the idea of a levy on employers on the French pattern whichwould be remitted for those who provided adequate training.69. There would still remain, however, the need for additional arrangements to cover retraining of adults whose skills had become obsolete or who had missedthe chance of an apprenticeship. Apart from the question of timing mentioned inparagraph 66 there are at present three limitations on Government action here:(i) The Ministry of Labour&apos;s direct training facilities are small and cateralmost exclusively for the disabled, the unemployed and ex-Regulars.The courses normally last six months and at present cover trades in engineering, building, radio and television servicing, and miscellaneousoccupations such as typewriter repair and hairdressing. The capacityof all the centres is only 5,000 trainees a year, in contrast to a capacityof some 25,000-30,000 for similar centres which cater mostly foryounger fit workers in France. The total cost in 1959-60 was  1,857,000,giving a cost of  536 (of which  172 represents allowances) for eachtrainee successfully completing a course.(ii) Trainees are paid allowances ranging from  5 10s. to  8 a week; this rate isa positive disincentive to training, since it is below the rate of pay ofmany unskilled workers (currently about  8 5s. in the engineering industry) and even further below their earnings. If arrangements couldbe made for employers to send workers already in their employment and in receipt of wages to the centres for training, it would be possibleto attract men of higher quality and at the same time economise on thepayment of allowances. A very small amount of such training is already undertaken, and the possibility is being considered of expanding it onthe basis of charging a fee to the employers.(iii) Present training is very much subject to limitations by the trade unions.In building it is confined to the disabled; in draughtsmanship the unionkeeps a jealous eye on it; in engineering the attitude varies from one area to another. There are some signs of change, but they need to be developed.70. We identify this whole field of training for examination and action. Inparticular, we think the following are of importance: the examination of the levysystem; the division of responsibility for training; consideration of the expansionof Government centres and increase of allowances in the period of retraining,especially in connexion with the training of persons already in employment. Inthe immediate future priority must be given to increasing the number of apprentices,but means of improving the retraining of adults should also be considered now, sothat action can be taken at the appropriate time.
72. The disparity between the rate of increase of average earnings and of.D.P. per worker is the biggest single danger to healthy growth in the future. Therise in prices in the United Kingdom has been greater than in most other countries and has gradually eroded the benefits of the 1949 devaluation. If British costs goon rising at the present rate, not only will this country be unable to sell enoughexports to pay for the rising volume of imports required by the potential rate of growth, but even in the home market British goods will become less competitive,so that imports will rise still further. The deterioration of the balance of paymentsshows the need to prevent this continuing. Looking ahead, there can be no doubtthat a continuation of past experience will carry with it a very real possibility of devaluation being forced upon this country.73. Although past efforts have produced no acceptable alternative to present arrangements, it is now exceedingly urgent to find a way through these problems.The essential need is to find a means whereby the national interest is brought tobear on wage negotiations. Under present arrangements this does not happen.Profound changes of opinion and practice will be required to bring it about, andthey will not occur overnight. An unremitting effort is needed. Opportunities forinfluencing public opinion must be seized as they occur. Until some specificprogress has been made, public statements of a general character are likely to do more harm than good.74. The problem is not peculiar to this country, as the recent study by the experts convened by the O.E.E.C. to examine the problem of rising prices hasshown. Experience elsewhere may well be instructive, but the problem is peculiarlyurgent for Britain because of the weakness of the balance of payments. The changeof attitude needed may be more easily brought about if the solution of the wagesproblem is linked to the other matters discussed in this report as part of a widepolicy for increasing efficiency and growth. The experts&apos; report put the matterwell: &quot; There is ... no one fault of the past to be corrected, no single new gadgetto be added to the armoury of stabilisation instruments. None the less it is idleto think that the problem of rising prices will solve itself&quot;.AID TO INDUSTRY75. Changes in demand and technology have the inevitable consequence thatsome industries expand quickly while, at the other end of the scale, others will bedeclining. There is nothing new in this but the pace of these changes is likely toincrease in the future and will make it important to develop a conscious policy for dealing with these industrial changes and particularly the problems of decliningindustries.76. The most important continuing Government action in this sphere hasbeen the distribution of industry policy followed since 1945; as a result factoriesbuilt by the Board of Trade have provided 200,000 jobs, mostly in areas of decliningindustries, since 1945. Complementing this has been the check to the rate of expansion in over-employed areas in the Midlands and South-East by limitations on the issue of Industrial Development Certificates. There have been strongpositive arguments for pursuing this policy with its combination of inducementsand deterrents. Besides the social reasons, the economic arguments have beenstrong, especially the desire to use existing social capital (&quot; taking the work to theworkers&quot;), and on the other hand the need to reduce congestion elsewhere, withits unforeseen effect on many costs and the stimulus which it gives to rising wagesthrough extreme competition for skilled labour, e.g., in the Midlands.77. This policy has generally been accepted as sound, but it has proved hard to determine where the balance should be struck between the advantages described above and the disadvantage of steering industry (usually with Government financial support) to areas where the return on the capital and labour is less than would havebeen obtained elsewhere. This merges with the more general problem of industrialchange and of declining industries. The cost of Government assistance to private industry is large  135 million in 1961-62 without including the subsidies of  270million to agriculture, where somewhat different questions arise. Examples of the conflict between social considerations and the principle, fundamental to growth,that resources of capital and labour should go where they will yield the best return
include the large part of the National Coal Board&apos;s total loss in recent years whichis accounted for by the substantial deficits incurred on keeping coal mines open inScotland, subsidies to hill farmers, and the siting of the new steel strip mills, whichwas ultimately settled primarily for soical-geographical reasons with the result that britain is likely to have three new strip mills with perhaps inadequate total capacityat higher cost than would otherwise have been the case.78. In dealing with declining industries it seems desirable that a sharpdistinction should be made between assistance (whether by subsidy or protection)which is given for a transitional period (e.g., for the reorganisation of the cottonindustry) and assistance which is likely to go on indefinitely, for instance, on grounds of social policy. In some instances there may well be a case on economic grounds for positive steps to contract an industry in order to make it more efficient; andin suitable places the distribution of industry policy may be able to help bydiversifying employment. But where assistance is not temporary and there is no prospect that the industry will be more efficient after a period of protection,consideration should be given to finding ways of achieving the social and politicalobjects at lower economic cost. It would seem desirable therefore to avoidcommitments to keep an industry alive when it cannot survive on its own feet;where abrupt change is not practical, it may well be that consideration should begiven mainly to cushioning the effect on the individual rather than the effect onthe industry itself. In suitable instances one way of avoiding continuingcommitments would be to buy out or pension off those concerned in the decliningindustry as a once-and-for-all transaction. This should make it possible to reducenot only the spread of subsidy in the future but also the amounts paid to the relatively efficient firms which may survive.79. There have been important advances of policy in this sphere since theend of the war, but we think there is a real danger that excessive resources maybe put into industries whose future is doubtful or whose geographical location iseconomically more costly. The difficulties are likely to increase in the future,particularly with the growing habit of industries to appeal to Government forassistance. There is a complex series of issues here which requires further attention and we identify this as a matter of importance.RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES80. In the following paragraphs we identify as worthy of further study certaingroups of problems where we suspect that there are impediments to nationalefficiency. These are business restrictive practices and monopoly, restrictions oncompetition in retailing and restrictive practices by labour.Business Restrictive Practices81. These are at present dealt with in two ways. First, restrictive collective agreements are compulsorily registrable and the Restrictive Practices Court has thetask of deciding whether they are in the public interest. (The impact of this system is far greater than the number of cases taken by the Court would suggest, sincemany agreements have been abandoned as their originators realised how low weretheir chances of approval by the Court.) The question arises whether the existing powers are adequate. There is some evidence that collective registrable agreements which have been either prohibited by the Court or abandoned have been superseded informal agreements which are not registrable and which have a similar effect.Open price agreements (where firms exchange information about the prices) are an example. Again, since the multi-partite agrements between the Austin motor company and its agents were abandoned, the coimpany has concluded a series ofbipartite agreements with them. Some informal agreements may fall technicallywithin the present scope of the Monopolies Commission, although for reason explained below no cases of this kind have been referred to them.82. The second instrument of policy is the Monopolies Commission whichhas the function of examining cases of monopoly, as defined in the Act, which are referred to it by the Board of Trade.   At present the available powers are not
fully used. Although the board can refer cases on its own initiative, in practicereferences have generally been made only as a result of complaints. This means that some prima facie evidence is necessary before a reference is made; and it also has had the consequence that although the Board of Trade have powers to refer to the Commission two kinds of cases (those in which more than one-third of thesupply of goods is provided or bought either by a single firm, or by several firms which, without agreement, all act in the same way), in practice the powers havebeen used only in respect of the first class of cases. Two questions arise: first,whether the Board of Trade should embark on some kind of detective work inorder to obtain evidence, instead of waiting for complaints to be made; and second,whether, under the present powers, the Government have sufficiently activelyfollowed up recommendations of the Monopolies Commission. It must, however,be recognised that in many cases the Monopolies Commission^ findings have been divided and in others they have not found grounds for major objections.83. For both the Restrictive Practices Court and the Monopolies Commissionthere may be a case for changing the whole approach to this subject and adopting a policy more like that of the United States anti-trust policies. But public opinion in this country tends to be quite different from that in the United States. A radicalalteration of our policies would need to be made acceptable to public opinion.84. We understand that the Board of Trade have embarked on a study ofthese broad questions and we therefore simply identify them as relevant to growth.85. A further question which we suggest the Board of Trade might bear inmind in these studies is whether there should be some control over mergers. Whilemany mergers have sound market or technological justification, others may have their main effect in lessening competition. It might be that, for instance, a specialdivision of the Monopolies Commission should be set up with powers to investigateand report on the desirability in the national interest of proposed mergers (possibly in the manner of the newspaper enquiry).Restriction in Retailing86. Competition between shops is limited both by individual price maintenance (since restrictive resale price maintenance became illegal and individualprice maintenance became easier to enforce under Section 25 of the restrictive trade Practices Act, 1956) and by the regulation of shop hours. In consequence,the rise of new forms and methods of retailing and the expansion of the efficientretailer (who can afford to sell at lower prices or is ready to sell at hours more convenient to customers than his competitors) are impeded. Resale price maintenance tends to attract a superfluity of resources into retailing by protecting the less efficient retailer; and, by affecting the prices of some 20 per cent, of all goods and services entering into personal expenditure, it raises the general levelof prices. Many Western countries now have legislation restricting this practice.87. We identify as a significant issue resale price maintenance, which is a restrictive practice attracting a good deal of public attention. It is already being investigated by the Board of Trade, at the request of the Economic PolicyCommittee.88. A less important but also relevant matter in this context is shop hourslegislation. Apart from Sunday closing, the main restrictions on shop hours arethe imposition of an early closing day and the prescription of the time in the evening by which all shops must be shut.89. Historically the Shops Act was introduced for the protection ofshopkeepers; in the course of time its retention was justified for the protection ofworkers. The second purpose is now unnecessary, or can be achieved in other ways;the first now seems inimical to economic growth and efficiency. More flexiblehours would benefit many consumers, possibly enabling some of them to workpart-time jobs; and by increasing competition between shops it might help to drive out inefficiency, releasing some labour to other parts of the economy. Forthese reasons we believe that there is a prima facie case for repealing the Act.It is understood that Home Office officials have proposed abolition and that theHome Secretary may shortly be consulting his colleagues. It will be important tobear in mind the effect not only of the Shops Act itself but of local regulations which are believed in some cases to be more restrictive than the Act in practice. .
Restrictive Labour Practices90. In origin, most restrictive labour practices had a reasonable basis in theinterest either of the standard of work performed or of the safety and health ofthe workers concerned. Often they were in the interests of the employers, who mayhave introduced them. But it is no longer by any means true that all restrictivelabour practices serve generally defensible and socially useful ends. Many owe theirorigin to a state of affairs which no longer exists, and apart from the direct effects of particular practices, they foster an attitude of mind which is inimical to efficiency and economic growth. There are practices which:(a) prevent efficient use of manpower, e.g., by insisting that particular work should be reserved exclusively for a particular craft; they also give riseto demarcation disputes, which are a frequent source of loss of workingtime;(b) lead to uneconomic working, e.g., by requiring manning scales for theoperation of particular plant which are not justified; in particular, theintroduction of new machinery and new methods of working may behindered or prevented by stipulations concerning the numbers ofworkers to be employed and the rates of pay;(c) hinder the creation of an adequate skilled labour force in particular trades,by unnecessary restrictions on entry to skilled occupations or on theage at which persons can be admitted to apprenticeship;(d) restrict output, e.g., by placing a ceiling on earnings or output;(e) prevent the introduction of work study and method study.91. Restrictive labour practices have in many cases come to be acceptedover the years by trade unions and employers as customs and practice. Generallytherefore they come to public notice only when there is industrial trouble ordifficulty either between employers and workpeople or between the workpeoplethemselves. In addition, they are difficult to isolate in the structure of an industry,being inter-related with other terms and conditions of employment.92. From time to time efforts have been made to tackle the problem of restrictive practices, either generally or in particular aspects. Some of these developments have been recent:(a) In 1959 the report was published of an inquiry undertaken by the Ministryof Labour&apos;s National Joint Advisory Council on practices which impede the full and efficient use of manpower. The Council recognised thatthere remained unsolved problems in a number of industries andappealed to the industries concerned &quot; to make yet further efforts toget to grips with their problems &quot;. The Council also said that it was prepared to ask for further reports on the progress made.(b) In February 1961 the terms of reference announced for the RoyalCommission on the newspaper and magazine industry includedefficiency of production.(c) Part of the terms of reference of the Rochdale Committee of Inquiry intodocks and harbours, set up at the end of March 1961, are to consider&quot; whether the methods of working can be improved &quot;.(d) In April 1961 in its Report on the prospects for the shipbuilding industry the Dunnett Committee commented on labour relations in the industryand more particularly on the utilisation of labour.(e) In the motor industry, resistance to the introduction of work study, whichthe employers felt to be essential to ensure efficiency and to maintain theindustry&apos;s competitive position, and demarcation difficulties were discussed at recent talks, chaired by the Minister of Labour, betweenthe leading employers in the industry and the members of the ExecutiveCouncil of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions.93. Because many restrictive labour practices do not come to public notice,it is impossible to form any complete estimate of the loss of productive efficiencyarising from them. But it continues to be large and we identify this as a field forfurther action. The essence of the matter is to create a public opinion which willenable the public interest to be injected into these arrangements. Previous actionsuggests possible methods through an approach to industry in general and by
inquiries into specific industries where damaging practices are thought to exist.The suggestion has also been made of establishing new machinery, perhaps of aquasi-judicial character, for examining complaints concerning restrictive labourpractices. This question has recently been brought before Ministers by the Ministerof Labour, and is to be considered further by the Cabinet.94. In any action that is taken the general point should be borne in mind thatrestrictive labour practices are not limited to industry. They exist in other spheres of employment, including the professions (thus, when discussing restrictive practices,Trade Unions point to the fact that a Queen&apos;s Counsel must always have his Juniorpaid at a fixed proportion of his leader&apos;s fee). In many cases the professions justify their requirements for entry by the need to safeguard a proper standard of work.The craft unions also use this as one of their main arguments for keeping certainrestrictive labour practices. Any general action in regard to such practices should recognise their widespread nature and the need to probe the reasons in justification of them wherever they occur. In this way the industrial worker will be less inclined to think he is being singled out for special consideration.Restrictive Practices created by Government95. Certain practices of restrictive effect the Government has itself broughtabout. The Shops Act has already been mentioned; three further examples arethe price discrimination practised by the Milk Marketing Board ever since theirfoundation in the thirties, restriction on access to cheap imported fuel, reinforced by the new duty on imported oils, and restriction on entry to the road haulagebusiness resulting from the need to obtain A licences. (The value of an lA licenceis currently rated in parts of the trade as  350 per ton unladen weight.) As currentdiscussion shows, there are other important aspects of these questions; there are good reasons for these particular practices; nevertheless they have, as they were intended to, important effects, and we identify the danger that measures of this kindmay be introduced without due regard being paid to their impact on efficiency andgrowth. We discuss this in more general terms in paragraphs 105--109.TARIFFS96. Closely related to the restrictive practices discussed above is the questionof tariffs. Moreover, changes in the tariffs are one means for combating restrictive practices. Britain now has, on the whole, higher tariffs on industrial goods thanher main competitors. Manufactures and semi-manufactures are assessed atrates ranging from 10 per cent, and upwards, and many goods, notably electricalarticles, fur, glassware and motor vehicles, run up as high as 33^ per cent, andsome to 50 per cent. (Where purchase tax is levied, further protection is affordedsince it is charged on the price after payment of duty.) The whole system has alarge adventitious element in present-day circumstances, since it is often a product of situations long past when new industries were being started up or there washigh unemployment and tariffs were imposed because particular imports were ontoo high a level. As the President of the Board of Trade recently said about thetariff system:&quot;... it bears the marks of history rather than of scientific design ... on animportant range of industrial goods, except for Commonwealth imports, weare a high-tariff country, with an average level of duties substantially higherthan that for comparable classes of goods in the United States and theEuropean Economic Community. Our industrial tariff is also higher thanmost of our E.F.T.A. partners.&quot;97. In the general pursuit of efficiency and the stimulation of competition,tariff reductions could have an important part, particularly where restrictive practices are concerned. The height of the tariff and the efficiency of the industry concerned are by no means necessarily closely related; indeed, some of the more highly protected industries are among the most efficient; nevertheless, the haphazarddevelopment of our tariff system means that it works in a manner far too protectivefor the health of many industries: it reduces the spur of competition to those which
might be more efficient, and it hampers the process of decline in others. In short,the tariff system tends to be an impediment to adaptability and change. We think,therefore, that there should generally be a bias in favour of reducing tariffs.98. When the balance of payments is as weak as it is at present, it is difficultto con template drastic unilateral tariff reductions because of the increase in imports which must be expected to follow in the short term. Moreover, we shall wish to bargain tariff reductions in the discussions about the relationship of Britain andother members of E.F.T.A. to the European Economic Community which are nowin train. If successful, these negotiations will lead to large reductions in, and eventually elimination of, tariffs. If, however, the negotiations are not successful,the unilateral modification of tariffs in the interests of national economic efficiencyshould, we suggest, be considered on its merits. The forthcoming discussions on further tariff reductions at GATT and in connexion with the E.E.C. have put theBoard of Trade in a position to know a great deal more about the impact ofparticular tariffs on a wide variety of industries. This would provide a basis forthe necessary investigations. We identify this as an issue which may requireexamination in due course.TAXATION99. Public authorities take about 33 per cent, of the gross national productin taxation, local rates or national insurance contributions, so that the effect onthe economy must be significant. Apart from stabilisation policy or tariffs, other questions are relevant, e.g., the relation of direct and indirect taxation, thenarrowing base of the latter, the operation of initial and investment allowances,the difference between average and marginal rates of tax, and the dependence oflocal taxation on property values.100. As it stands to-day, the system for financing public expenditure is aproduct of history. It is not necessarily the most suitable for an efficientfull-employment economy capable of sustained growth. Central Governmenttaxes are designed mainly from the viewpoint of raising revenue and achievingindividual equity, and their pattern has been greatly influenced by the methodsof war finance, e.g., purchase tax. To these aims has been added more recently the aim of stabilising the economy. The result is that we have a system of publicfinancing of great complexity, but remarkably little is known about the general economic effects on efficiency and growth either of the system as a whole or ofparticular taxes, rates or contributions. Past enquiries have concentrated on theeffect of direct taxation on particular groups or individuals, principally from the standpoint of accountants and tax lawyers; the Final Report of the RoyalCommission on taxation of profits and income had hardly anything to say aboutthe economic effects of taxation with which we are concerned here, and there hasbeen no enquiry into the incidence of indirect taxation as a whole, though there hasbeen some study of purchase tax. Another disadvantage of the present system isthat its size and complexity is itself a burden to industry on account of the efforts made to fit each enterprise^ activities most advantageously into the system.101. We identify this as a matter which needs thorough examination. Thekind of enquiry we have in mind would be wide-ranging and have as its main aimthe building up of a body of fact and analysis on the economic effects of taxationfrom the point of view of efficiency and adaptability. This should include theundertaking or commissioning of research in order to elucidate the facts.102. This would be a long-term job. It may be that in the interim therewould have to be a good deal of study of possible reforms of the tax structure onfiscal, political or administrative grounds; Sir Denis Ricketfs Working Party is,for example, examining the effects of direct taxation on overseas investment andremittances. But whatever changes may be made in particular parts of one fieldwe think that they should still not be allowed to obscure the need for a more fundamental study, so that in later years the effects of the financing operations ofpublic authorities on efficiency and growth may be more clearly understood thanthey are to-day.
.    PUBLIC EXPENDITURE103. Similar considerations to those relating to taxation apply to public expenditure. The Central Government, local authorities, national insurance funds and nationalised industries and publicly-owned trading services absorb betweenthem over 25 per cent, of the gross national product in their purchases of goods and services, and redistribute, through transfer and debt interest payments, over15 per cent, more; within this total public investment makes up 40 per cent, of allfixed investment. When the total of public expenditure is so large a proportionof the G.N.P. its pattern must have important effects on economic growth. Forexample, Government operations overseas, including representation, aid and defence, now cost (net) over  400 million a year, and this has a clear and pressingeffect on the balance of payments. Again, Government research and developmentabsorbs a great deal of highly-skilled manpower. But the effects of public expenditure on national efficiency have been little studied, and in the past littleconsidered in reaching decisions on proposals for new expenditure. We identifythis as an important question.104. The report on Public Expenditure and Resources, 1961-62 to 1965-66,which was submitted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer under cover of C. (61) 88,made the beginnings of such an approach to the problems of expenditure. But wethink there is much more to be done in that direction, not only (as that reportrecommended) on working out more stringent criteria for assistance to industryand other related expenditures, but also in applying the idea of &quot; nationalefficiency &quot; to social services and other expenditures which have not previously been considered in this way.ADMINISTRATION105. We have laid much emphasis in this report on the need for a constantwatch on the economic aspects of policy proposals coming before Government andof the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action. The balance is by no meanseasy to strike. Not all costs and benefits are expressible in pecuniary terms. Thepreservation of scenery is important although its value is not quantifiable. Thereare costs and benefits which can be valued but are frequently different from theexpense and revenue which they may involve for Government; for example, theloss of revenue from a reduced yield from fuel taxes as a result of improvements in fuel efficiency does not represent a cost to the economy. Again, there may be aneconomic cost in protecting an uncompetitive industry by raising the tariff for whichthe financial result may be an increase in Customs revenue against which has to beset an economic loss of keeping scarce manpower in a relatively unprofitableindustry.106. The problems are indeed complex and are likely to get more so in a country like ours with a large sense of public social duties. Economic costs and benefits should not always override other factors, but as increased efficiency mustbe the base for faster economic growth, it is important that the balance be struck asclearly as possible.107. At present no one is charged with the task of advising Departments onthe implications for overall economic efficiency and growth of any proposals for action by the Government. Yet it is a function which those responsible for putting forward individual proposals cannot always be in a position effectively to discharge:they may not be technically equipped to form a view of what may be difficult issuescalling for expert knowledge, and they are unlikely to be able to see the effect ofan individual proposal in relation to the trend of Government policy and nationalrequirements as a whole. In the sphere of public expenditure the plowden committee has drawn attention to a somewhat similar issue arising from theconsideration of proposals for expenditure separately from questions of financing.108. Similar problems have arisen in the past when Government has found it necessary to create means for receiving advice on new questions of importance tothe economy. There is a precedent in the arrangements for dealing with proposals
which may affect the balance of payments. Since the end of the war it has been recognised that the protection of the balance of payments is crucial to UnitedKingdom policy, and it has become automatic for any proposals which might affectthe balance of payments to be referred to the Overseas Finance Division of theTreasury for advice. As a result, Departments and Ministers have available tothem expert advice, both on the immediate implications of an individual proposal and on the way in which it fits into the whole body of policy and decisions affectingthe balance of payments. Somewhat similarly, the views of the Ministry of labour would be sought on any proposals which might affect the level of employment.109. There seems to be a case for designating a branch of government organisation to consider proposals which are likely to affect economic efficiency andgrowth. This step would, in effect, indicate that the use of our resources in such away as to give maximum encouragement to efficiency and growth is now of suchoverwhelming importance that Ministers should never be asked to reach decisionswithout having advice on this specific aspect. We identify this whole matter forfurther consideration.
