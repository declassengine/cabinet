C. (61) 5724th April, 1961CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS reform memorandum by the Lord chancellor have considered with the Home Secretary, the Lord President ofthe Council, the Attorney-General, the Chief Whip and Lord St. Aldwynthe terms of a statement to be made by the Home Secretary in the Houseof Commons as soon as possible about the appointment of a Joint SelectCommittee to consider the reform of the composition of the House ofLords, the eligibility of Peers and Peeresses to sit in either House ofParliament and to vote at Parliamentary Elections, the renunciation ofPeerages, and the possible remuneration of members of the House ofLords.2.     A draft statement incorporating the proposed terms of reference for a Joint Select Committee is appended hereto.House of Lords,   S. V/. 1.24th April, 1961.annex draft statement in the course of the debate on 13th April, on the Report of theCommittee of Privileges on the Stansgate case, my Rt. Hon. andLearned Friend the Attorney-General and I indicated that, while theGovernment did not favour the appointment of a Committee to considerthe single issue arising in that case, we should consider thepossibility of a broader enquiry, and that we should pay great attentionto the views expressed in the debate.2.      The broad issue that arises is the composition of the other place.There is in the Governments mind no doubt as to the need to maintain in this age an efficient Second Chamber,    Has the time come to modify-1-COPY NO.      Ll&quot;K.
the principle of automatic hereditary succession to a Lordship ofParliament?    Should the hereditary Peers automatically sit in anotherplace or should there be some process of selection?3.     Next there is a variety of questions relating to the individualposition of persons holding or inheriting Peerages.    First of all,should a Peer or Peeress be entitled to renounce his or her Peerage -both the title and all that belongs to it?    If so, should the renunciationbe revocable or should it be for life ?    Should the Peerage pass to an ;heir immediately or on the death of the person renouncing it, or should it be extinguished?4.      There follows the question whether any Peer, either by whollyrenouncing his Peerage or by renouncing merely the right to sit in another place, or indeed by some other means, should be able to become eligible for membership of this House.5,      There are numerous anomalies in our Constitution.    Thus, a scottish Peer who is not elected as a representative Peer is never-theless unable to offer himself as a candidate for this House or to vote in elections to this House.    An Irish Peer may be elected to this Housebut, unless so elected, may not vote at Parliamentary elections.    APeeress in her own right may vote, but is generally thought to be dis-qualified from membership of this House, and yet is not entitled to sit in another place.6.     Finally we feel that any review of the composition of the otherplace must also have some regard to the question of providing some assistance to enable more Peers, without unreasonable personalsacrifice, to play an active part in the business of that place.7.      The Governments conclusion is that it is desirable that allthese matters should be considered together.    We have also givenmuch thought to the form of an enquiry.    Various bodies, including aconference of Party leaders, have eat   on these problems in the past and, on the whole, their labours have not been very fruitful.    we propose a two-tier enquiry.    First, we intend to move for the appoint -ment of a Joint Select Committee of both Houses: -&quot;To consider, having regard among other things to the need tomaintain an efficient Second Chamber -(a) the composition of the House of Lords;(b) whether any, and if so what, changes should be madein the rights of Peers and Peeresses in their own right in regard to eligibility to sit in either Houseof Parliament and to vote at Parliamentary elections;(c) whether any, and if so what, changes should be madein the law regarding the surrender of Peerages;
(d) whether the number of Peers and Peeresses entitledto sit and vote in the House of Lords should belimited, and if so to what extent and in what manner;(e) whether it would be desirable to introduce the principleof remuneration for members of the House of lords and, if so, subject to v/hat conditions;and to make recommendations. &quot;8.     Second; we think that the Committee will need the help of officials.The House will remember that the Select Committee appointed in 1952and 1953 to consider the Army and Air Force Acts had the assistanceof a departmental drafting committee.    In the same way, we proposethat the Joint Select Committee should have the assistance of anofficial committee.    In order that the Joint Select Committee&apos;s workmay proceed without undue delay, we have already put in hand thepreparation by officials of the material on which it can work.April. 1961-3-
