Washington Talks;;v: Mr. Diefenbaker asked what impression Mr. Macmillan had formed, during his visit to Washington, of the new United States Administration.-\&quot; Mr. Macmillan said that in general the new Administration were likely to adopta more political approach towards their problems than their predecessors and tobe more flexible. General Eisenhower had had great courage and strength ofcharacter and a basic fairness, combined with a remarkable ability to take the rightdecision in an emergency. President Kennedy was; however, an experiencedpolitician and more sensitive to public opinion. It should now be easier to discussour common problems with the United States Government objectively anddispassionately, and to arrive at joint assessments of the nature of the difficulties to be overcome. Even though the Administration might not always be able totake action in the desired direction, because of the pressures to which they were subject, we could at least hope that we should have a clearly understood and common objective towards which to work.2. United Nations: China:;; Mr. Diefenbaker asked what the current attitude of the United States!Administration was towards the representation of China in the United Nations.When he had seen President Kennedy in January his attitude seemed to havehardened on this question, in spite of what he had said during the election oampaign.He had evidently found, when he took office, that the pressure on him was greaterthan he had expeoted.
1/mr. Macmillan said ithat it would have been easier to find a solution of this problem if the United States Government had been willing to tackle it three orfour years ago. The difficulties were now very much greater. Apart from the hostility of the American public towards the Communist Government of China,there was also the problem of Formosa. The United States Government could not accept any solution which would involve the disappearance of Formosa from theUnited Nations. They were therefore most anxious that this issue should not come up on the basis of credentials for a single Chinese seat; for it would then be settled by a simple majority vote which, if it went in favour of Communist China, would automatically exclude Formosa from the Organisation. They would thereforeprefer that the question should come forward in some other form which wouldrequire a two-thirds majority. It might perhaps be linked with the problem ofenlarging the composition of the Security Council and other Councils of theOrganisation. Alternatively it might be presented in the form of a &quot; successorState &quot; resolution, following the precedent of the resolution passed when the united arab Republic bad succeeded to the seats previously held by Egypt.and Syria.All these various possibilities were now under consideration by the Administration.They were anxious that their allies should for the moment say as little as possibleabout this question in public: they did not wish to appear to be under pressure on it. If a formula could be evolved which commanded general respect, it wouldnot matter greatly to the United States Administration if the Chinese communist government declined to accept it. It would of course be awkward if the ChineseNationalists exercised the veto against it. Their present attitude was not known;for the United States naturally would not consult them until they had a clearer ideaof the line which they wished to take.3. LaosMr. Diejenbaker asked what prospects there were of achieving a settlement in Laos.Mr. Macmillan said that the Soviet Government had not yet replied to thelatest British note, but he still hoped that it would be possible to secure a cease-fire and a conference.   The new United States Administration were now convincedthat the right course was to go all out for a political settlement in Laos.   In thelast days of the previous Administration the American military leaders and the diplomatic representatives on the spot had been prepared to support an anti-Communist Government by military means; but the new Administration had seen the dangers of military intervention in Laos and were prepared to accept a,.,neutral regime which would provide a pad between Vietnam and Thailand.   In ;this, as in other matters, they were determined to impose a stricter political controlover the Pentagon and over their local representatives.  They should be able topersevere in this policy unless some very respected figure, such as General )lEisenhower, came out publicly against them.   They might then be placed in a &apos;difficult political&apos; dilemma.   For their Republican opponents would be quick toaccuse them of appeasement if they sought a political settlement and Laos in thefend went over to the Communist side: but, equally, if they were obliged to authorise..military intervention, they would be criticised on the basis that, as in Korea, aDemocrat Government had embarked on war.Mr. Macmillan said that he thought it probable that President Kennedy would ;find a way through this dilemma. In general, he believed that official and diplomaticcircles in Washington tended to overrate the difficulties of opinion in Congress:,his own view was that the American public were more inclined to let theAdministration get on with the business of government once it had been elected; :and he thought that President Kennedy would be able to command general public;.support for his policy.4. Nuclear TestsIn reply to questions by Mr. Diefenbaker, Mr. Macmillan said that the Russiansnow seemed to be adopting an obstructive attitude in the Geneva negotiations on nuclear tests. They seemed to be going back on positions which they had previously,accepted. For example, they were now unwilling to accept a Control commission with a single Chairman and were arguing that there should be three Chairmenrepresenting, respectively, the Communist bloc, the Western Powers and the neutral,mm
countries. This proposal was based on the argument that no one could be&quot; objective &quot; as between Communist and non-Communist interests. It followed the line which they were taking on the structure of the United Nations. If theypersisted in this attitude it v/as unlikely that an agreement would be concluded.5. EuropeMr. Diefenbaker said that he had been interested to note that the communique issued at the end of the Washington talks had included a reference to the importanceof economic and political unity in Europe. Was he to understand that the UnitedStates Government were now anxious that the United Kingdom should join the six?Mr. Macmillan said that the attitude of the new Administration on thisquestion was different from that of their predecessors. They were more ready torecognise the dangers of a further political division in Europe. They saw that,if a close economic and political unity developed between the countries of the Six,the inner core of Europe might drift away from the wider concept of an atlantic community and might even constitute itself as a third force in world politics.There were indeed some signs of such a development already. Under Frenchleadership, the countries of the Six were not co-operating fully with the otherleading countries of the West in the current problems of the Congo and Laos. Thiswas probably an example of General de Gaulle&apos;s reluctance to accept &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; leadership; and more difficulties of this kind must be expected if the&quot;six were left to develop separate political policies of their own under French leadership.From that point of view the position would be no better after General de gaulle had gone; for it was likely that the leadership of the Six would then be assumed&apos;; by Germany. It was for these reasons that the United States Administration now felt that it would be better if the United Kingdom joined the political associations of the Six, where they would provide an element of stability. Mr. Macmillan said. that this was in accord with his own view of the situation, and he was glad to feel that it now had the support of the United States Government.Mr. Diefenbaker said that the United States Government seemed to be considering only the political implications. Canada, and other commonwealth countries, must concern themselves with the economic consequences. These were likely to be serious. Canada&apos;s economic interests could not fail to be prejudicedif the United Kingdom accepted the full economic implications of joining the Six.public opinion in Canada would be gravely troubled by this development.Mr. Macmillan said that the basis of the United Kingdom&apos;s association with the Six had still to be negotiated. The interests of other Commonwealth countries would certainly not be overlooked in these negotiations.  He hoped that it wouldbe possible to secure some derogations in favour of Commonwealth trade.Admittedly, there would be some economic disadvantages both for the United&apos; Kingdom itself and for other Commonwealth countries; but these would have to. &quot;be weighed against the great political advantage of avoiding a further division of Europe and preventing inner Europe from deviating away from, the concept of the-Atlantic community.   Finally, it must be recognised that, on economic groundsalone, the final choice would be between maintaining a system of commonwealth preference with a United Kingdom of declining economic strength, or surrendering&apos; some of the advantages of Commonwealth preference in return for a strongerUnited Kingdom and a wider European market.I .6. North Atlantic Treaty OrganisationMr. Diefenbaker asked what proposals the United States Administration had- in mind for the reform of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).Mr. Macmillan said that, on the political side, they were anxious to improve:. &apos;.. the procedures for consultation on all matters of common concern, including matters. - affecting territories outside the NATO area. They recognised, however, that some;- of these questions could not conveniently be discussed by the North Atlantic council as a whole; and they favoured the development of less formal methods of political; consultation through groups constituted ad hoc according to the subject for^/discussion.
Ottawa,fhh April, 1961.On the military side it was evident that they were not anxious to proceed withthe proposal of the Eisenhower Administration for the stationing of large numbersof M.R.B.Ms. in Europe. In general, they would be disinclined to favour anyfurther expansion of the nuclear capacity of NATO, and would assign a higher&apos;priority to the building up of its conventional forces. They were conscious of theuneasiness among the European members of the Alliance on the subject of nuclear weapons, but were hoping to remedy this by new proposals on political control which were now in course of formulation. These were based on the recognition that (i) there would be no great difficulty in authorising the use of nuclear weapons in retaliation against a nuclear attack; and (ii) if the question arose of using nuclear weapons to contain an attack by conventional forces in overwhelming strength,there would be more time for consultation.7. CubaMr. Diefenbaker said that the United States Government were pressing theCanadian Government to reduce the volume of trade between Canada and Cuba-though the amount of continuing trade between the United States and Cuba was still very much larger than that between Canada and Cuba. It seemed to him thatthe United States Administration Were disproportionately concerned about thesituation in Cuba.Mr. Macmillan said that it was not surprising that the United StatesGovernment should react strongly against the expropriation of American assets inCuba. But, apart from that, the Castro movement was quite different from thenormal pattern of revolutions in Latin America, in which one dictator was replaced by another. Castro had the support of the great mass of the under-privilegedpopulation. The new Administration in the United States were evidentlyconscious of the dangers presented by the sharp social contrast in many of theLatin-American countries, where great wealth Was concentrated in the hands of asmall minority while the mass of the population lived in abject poverty. This wasa situation which provided fertile ground for Communism; and, when once a communist regime had been established in one country in South America, thereWas a grave danger that other Countries might follow suit. The Soviet Governmentwould be quick to exploit this situation. No United States Government could contemplate such a development without anxiety.Mr. Macmillan said that, for his part, he recognised that trade boycotts wereineffective as a means of expressing disapproval of another country&apos;? regime. Theyusually had the result Of damaging the Commercial interests of the country whichimposed them, without producing any substantial effect on the regime which theywere designed to change. The same was true, in his opinion, of attempts to expressdisapproval of a Governments policies by withdrawing diplomatic recognition. Itmust, however, be recognised that it had become ingrained in American thinking that the grant of diplomatic recognition implied some measure of approval.8. Economic AidMr. Diefenbaker asked whether Mr. Macmillan had had any discussion in washington on the question of economic aid to less-developed countries.Mr. Macmillan said that, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, hehad undertaken to support in principle the new initiatives which the United states administration had taken at the recent meeting of the Development Aid Group inLondon.
P.M. (0) (61) 2nd MeetingNOTE OF MEETING WITH CANADIAN CABINET, TUESDAY,11th APRIL, 1961On 11th April, 1961, at 11-30 a.m., Mr. Macmillan attended ameeting of the Canadian Cabinet held in the Privy Council Office,Parliament Buildings, Ottawa. In addition to the members andSecretariat of the Canadian Cabinet, Sir Saville Garner, the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Ottawa, and Sir Norman Brook were. present at this meeting.Mr. Diefenbaker, in welcoming Mr. Macmillan, said that the Canadian cabinet would be glad to hear his views on the world economic situation with particular reference to the economic problems of Europe.Mr. Macmillan said that he was pleased to have this opportunity of meetingthe members of the Canadian Cabinet. He was always glad, when visitingCommonwealth capitals, to have the privilege of attending a Cabinet meeting;and this was the second occasion on which he had been able to do so in Ottawa.He would concentrate his remarks, as Mr. Diefenbaker had suggested, on the world economic situation and its political implications for Europe and for the atlantic community.In recent years the Communist bloc had been gaining ground at the expense ofthe West. The Soviet Union had greatly increased its economic strength. It stillsuffered from some economic stresses, especially in respect of agriculture; but itcommanded great economic power, to which its satellites in Eastern Europecontributed. Since the end of the war the Russian hold over their satellites hadbeen consolidated. They had withdrawn only from Austria; and they now seemedto realise that this was a mistake which they were not likely to repeat elsewhere.They were beginning to use methods of economic penetration over a wider area.Though the total of their economic aid to other countries was small in relation tothat given by the West, they seemed able to secure a high political return for it;By skilful propaganda they were able to gain as much credit for an expenditureof&apos;$50,000 as the West could win from $500,000. This was a challenge to theWestern countries. They should meet it by combining to develop their economic resources to the maximum and by improving their organisation for counteringCommunist attempts to build up economic domination over the emergent andunder-developed countries.  .Iff The time had come to review the economic organisation of the Western world.Fifteen years ago the economy of Europe was in ruins, owing to the ravages ofwar. Now, thanks largely to massive aid from the United States, Europe had madea.spectacular recovery; and the Six were capable of forming the most powerfuleconomic group in the world. It might be said that they were enjoying the fruitsof defeat. With no external debt, with their industries re-equipped with up-to-dateplant, and with abundant supplies of relatively cheap labour, they were in a positionto.offer strong competition in the export markets of the world. Meanwhile, inJNorth America, there was a trade recession: both in the United States and inCanada the economy was running well below its full capacity, with under-production and a substantial volume of unemployment. It was to be hoped that president Kennedy would find himself able to adopt expansionist policies to reverse-this trend. The test of his intentions would come within the next 6-12 months.t ; Mr. Macmillan said that, as he saw it, the main remedies were these.S First, it was desirable that a central banking system should be developed whichwould effectively provide a sound and sufficient credit base for the trade of the-Western world. There were signs that the central banks might now be ready tofaccept this responsibility. It was encouraging that, when the recent re-valuation of the Deutschemark had led to extensive speculation in the London market, theCentral banks had together taken joint action to steady the position.
I IfSecondly, all the Western countries should work together for the greatest possible expansion of trade throughout the Western world. All Governments were ready to agree in principle that world trade should be expanded, but each was aptin practice to protect its own industries. In conditions of under-production and unemployment there were alwaysstrong political pressures for protectionist measures.The remedy was to expand the credit system so as to increase production andtrade. Under those conditions the greater fear would be of inflation, rather thanunemployment; and the political pressures would then tend to work in favour of expansion.Thirdly, advantage should be taken of the current movement towards thecreation of larger trading areas. At the end of the 19th century the United states was itself the largest single trading area. Since the Ottawa Conference of 1932,the Commonwealth had established its own special system of preferences and free entry, though the value of this preferential system had decreased in recent years.Now there was a movement to create free trade areas in Europe first the Six and now the Seven, and the possibility of some merger between them. these developments were dictated by the technological developments in modern industry which, because of the increased capital investment which they involved, inevitablyrequired a larger area of sale. Modern industry needed larger markets. Thesewider free trade areas, though they were required by industry, raised difficulties for agriculture; and almost all countries which entered into such associations found itnecessary to make special provision for their agricultural and horticultural products.Even within the Six it was recognised that special arrangements would have to bemade for agriculture and horticulture.The United Kingdom Government were now contemplating the possibility ofsome form of close association with the Six. Before entering into such an association they had to consider their own agricultural and horticultural interests,their special relations with other Commonwealth countries and the interests oftheir partners in the European Free Trade Area. They were under an obligationto consult other Commonwealth Governments before final decisions were taken,and they would certainly honour that obligation. It now seemed possible thatthere was a basis for an economic settlement which, with suitable &quot; derogations &quot;,would not involve undue damage to those interests. Given political will on bothsides, there was a real possibility of an economic settlement which would make for greater economic unity in Europe. The main obstacle now was the attitude of theFrench, and particularly of General de Gaulle, who had hitherto been reluctant. to contemplate British participation in the political association of the Six.The attitude of the French Government was a crucial factor in this, situation.General de Gaulle had a passionate belief in the destiny of France as a great Power.He was also a man of indomitable will. By his own efforts he had done more than any living Frenchman to restore the strength and authority of France, and under his leadership the French took pride in their renewed strength. He was conscious that over the past&apos; 15 years France had been under the domination of the&quot;Anglo-Saxons &quot;, and he resented that domination. Now that the economic strength of France was restored, he would demand that she should be treated as apolitical equal. This attitude was exemplified by his. refusal to co-operate in manyof the current matters which were of common concern to the members of the atlantic Alliance. In the Congo and in Laos he was unwilling to bear any share ofthe responsibility: he treated the United Nations with indifference and w^sunwilling that France should play any leading part in it: he was unwilling to give full co-operation in NATO, where he declined to accept the principles of integrationor of interdependence and, if the French Army returned from Algeria, he wouldbe reluctant to place it under NATO command. In each of these particularinstances he would doubtless adduce special reasons for his attitude; but, taken together, they were all illustrations of his unwillingness to accept what he regardedas&apos; subordination to &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; leadership.Thus, if the Six developed into a close political unity, there was a great danger that, so long as they continued under French leadership, they woufd graduallyundermine the cohesion of the Atlantic Alliance. If, therefore, the Alliance was toremain the core of Western resistance to Communist encroachment, a new spiritmust be infused into it. The Alliance must be adjusted to changing circumstances.But its problem to-day was psychological, rather than technical. It must be adapted to fulfil a new role in the next phase of the East-West struggle where economic
Ottawa,11th April, 1961.and political co-operation would be at least as important as the military side of the alliance. In this a new spirit of unity was required and an organisation whichcould be adapted to meet the Sino-Soviet challenge, not in Europe only, but in africa, Latin America and other parts of the world. It was for these reasons,Mr. Macmillan concluded, that the special problems of Europe should now beconsidered in the wider context of the world situation to which he had referred atthe outset of his remarks. This was the main point which he had sought to pressduring his recent visit to the United States.Mr. Diefenbaker said that this new concept of unity in the free world, which mr. Macmillan had put forward in his talks with President Kennedy and in his speech at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, was a challenge to themembers of the Atlantic Alliance. He hoped and believed that the nations of thefree world would respond to this challenge. He also hoped that Mr. Macmillanwas right in believing that President Kennedy would find it possible to pursueexpansionist policies which would benefit the Canadian economy. He regretted that, up to date, no practical steps had been taken in this direction so far as concerned trade between the United States and Canada.Mr. Diefenbaker thanked Mr. Macmillan for the frank way in which he had expressed his views to the Canadian Cabinet.

West Indies^ Mr. Macmillan. said that the prospects of federation in the West Indies were now-uncertain. Much would depend on the results of the referendum in Jamaica.If the attempt to build a federation were frustrated, it was difficult to forecast whatthe constitutional development of the smaller islands would be. Separately, theycould not hope to be viable as independent units.The West Indies were experiencing serious economic difficulties. These wouldbe greatly eased if the pressure of population could be reduced. West Indians were already coming to the United Kingdom in very large numbers; it would be helpful if more could be absorbed in the Western hemisphere. At the request of the federal government he had asked the United States Administration to consider whetherthey could relax their restrictions on the immigration of West Indians. Could; Canada do anything to help?Mr. Diefenbaker said that the number of West Indians admitted to Canada,I as a proportion of their population, was already high. In most years it was second-;only to immigration from the United Kingdom. Over recent years it had averaged11,100 a year. While unemployment in Canada remained as high as it now was,He did not think it politically possible to do anything more.Mr. Macmillan said that, since 1955, no less than 160,000 West Indians hadbeen admitted to the United Kingdom.Mr. Diefenbaker said that, even so, he hoped that Mr. Macmillan would refrainwfrom letting it be known, at his Press conference that afternoon, that he had asked-the Canadian Government to consider whether larger numbers of West Indianstcould be admitted to Canada. Mr. Macmillan said that he could deal with questions
on this subject by referring to the interest which Canada had shown in the economic stability of the West Indies and by saying he was confident that this interest wouldbe maintained.2. Hong KongMr. Macmillan said that, in response to representations from president kennedy, he had promised to consider what steps could be taken to check thevolume of textile exports from Hong Kong to the United States. He understoodthat this problem was also giving rise to anxiety in Canada.Mr. Diefenbaker said that the Canadian Government were dissatisfied with theresults of the mission on this subject which they had recently sent to Hong Kong.They felt that they must now take unilateral action to deal with the situation.Mr. Macmillan asked what action they could take.Mr. Diefenbaker admitted that it would not be practical to impose a quota.Mr. Bryce said that it might be possible to determine values for these exports forpurposes of duty, and then to apply anti-dumping measures if the goods were soldat prices below that level. Like the Americans, the Canadians were concerned about the effect which the increase in these imports might have on the voluntary arrangements they had made for limiting the import of textiles from Japan. those arrangements represented an attempt to deal with the problem of low-cost exports from Japan; and it would be unfortunate if their effect were nullified by unilateral action on the part of Hong Kong.Mr. Macmillan said that thought would have to be given to the general problemof exports by low-cost producers. It was an old saying in Oldham, which exportedboth cotton goods and machinery for manufacturing cotton goods, that one halfof the town was busily engaged in putting the other half out of employment. Theindustrialised countries of the West faced a similar problem now when, by their economic aid, they helped to., build up in the less developed countries industries which would compete with their own production.Mr. Diefenbaker, in reply to a request by Mr. Macmillan, said that he would arrange for the United Kingdom Government to be informed in advance of any action which the Canadian Government decided to take to restrict the import of hong Kong textiles into Canada.3. UraniumA short discussion was held about the exchange of letters in which the UnitedKingdom Atomic Energy Authority had undertaken^in 1957 to buy a specifiedquantity of uranium from the Eldorado Company over the years 1963-66. It wasagreed that the next step must be for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authorityto resume their negotiations with a view to seeing whether some modifiedarrangements could be arrived at which would be acceptable to both sides.Mr. Diefenbaker said that he would arrange for a mission to go to the UnitedKingdom for this purpose. He had not yet decided what the composition ofthat mission should be.Mr. Macmillan said that, at his Press conference later that day, he wouldcontent himself with saying that the two Governments were agreed that thenegotiations between the Company and the Authority should be continued, andthat he understood that these would shortly be resumed in London.4. North Atlantic Treaty OrganisationMr. Macmillan said that he assumed that at the next Ministerial meeting ofthe North Atlantic Council in Oslo Canada would be represented by Mr. HowardGreen (Minister for External Affairs). It would be useful if Mr. Green could come to London on his way to Oslo so that he could consult with Lord Homebefore the meeting.  Mr. Diefenbaker said that this could doubtless be arranged.Mr. Macmillan said that, from what he had heard in Washington, it seemed,^unlikely that the United States Administration would continue to press the proposals
put forward by the previous Administration for the stationing of M.R.B.Ms. inEurope. Mr. Diefenbaker said that he was glad to hear this. In recent yearshigh-ranking American officers had indulged in dangerous talk about the use of nuclear weapons. They had given the impression that the military authorities inthe United States would be very ready to use these weapons in a &quot; preventive war &quot;.Partly as a result of this, public opinion in Canada was becoming restive about theuse of nuclear weapons. There was a strong body of opinion which was opposedto the stationing of nuclear weapons on Canadian soil unless a clear understandinghad been reached that they would not be used without a joint decision by both governments. This view was openly expressed by the leaders of the Liberal Party.In theC.C.F. and Labour Parties more extreme views were held; and it was beingsuggested in some quarters that Canada should dissociate herself from any useof nuclear weapons within the North Atlantic Alliance. There was no doubt thatthere had been a substantial upsurge of feeling in Canada in favour of nucleardisarmament. Associated with this was a feeling of distress over the French actionin seeking to develop an independent nuclear capacity of their own.5. BerlinMr. Diefenbaker asked whether the Soviet Government were likely to makeany early move over Berlin.Mr. Macmillan said that the Russians might be content to wait until afterthe German elections.Mr. Diefenbaker then asked what was the general attitude of the new UnitedStates Administration to this question.Mr. Macmillan said that they did not seem to have taken any final decisionyet. But it seemed likely that they would be concerned more with realities than with legalities. Thus, so long as military and civil supplies continued to move intoWest Berlin, they would be disinclined to take issue on the question whether the traffic was controlled by the Russians or by the East Germans even though this might seem to involve a de facto acceptance of the existence of an East GermanState. On the other hand, if the flow of supplies into West Berlin were physicallyimpeded, they would probably favour a strong reaction by military operations,on a larger scale than had been contemplated hitherto.Mr. Macmillan said that President Kennedy seemed disinclined to favour an-attempt to find a treaty basis for the Western position in Berlin. He himself had felt that our present juridical position, based on the original military occupation,was becoming more difficult to defend as the years passed and that we might do better if we could move over to a treaty basis. The Americans presumably feltthat we should have to pay too big a price for this; and it was certainly true thatwe were not in a strong negotiating position.6. South AfricaMr. Diefenbaker said that the South African Government had recentlycancelled a letter of intent, given before the recent Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers, to buy a large quantity of wheat from Canada. He asked whetherthe United Kingdom Government had any similar indication of a new attitudepa the part of the Union Government towards trade with other members of theCommonwealth.Mr. Macmillan said that the United Kingdom Government had had no suchVindication. Their impression was that the Union Government were anxious thattrading relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom should continueunchanged.7. ChinaH . Mr. Diefenbaker said that the Chinese Communists had recently bought/wheat from Canada for which they had paid in sterling. They were now making^tentative enquiries about the possibility of making further purchases on credit/&quot;terms. Had Mr. Macmillan any views on the expediency of extending credit to/the Communist Government of China?
lifeMr. Macmillan said that in his view this question could be determined on abasis of commercial judgment. The Chinese Communist Government had notasked for credit from the United Kingdom on a Government-to-Government basis.But, so far as he was aware, the facilities of the Export Credits guarantee department were available to United Kingdom firms wishing to trade withCommunist China.Ottawa,Uth April, 1961.
