(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 79 COPY NO.   jj 4CABINETSOUTHERN CAMEROONSMemorandum by the Prime ^MinisterOur Trusteeship responsibility for the Southern Cameroonswill end on 1st October, when the Territory becomes independent.    Inthe recent plebiscite its inhabitants (about 840,000) were only given the choice of voting to join Nigeria or of voting in favour of federation withthe Cameroun Republic (the former French Cameroun, which is stillsupported by the French Government - 3^ million people).    They chosethe latter.     -Cut discussions between Mr. Foncha, the Prime Ministerof the Southern Cameroons, and Mr. Ahidjo, the President of theCameroun Republic, are still in a relatively early stage;  and we cannotbe sure whether they will succeed in establishing a genuinely federal government or what will be their personal relations.2. The administration of the Southern Cameroons rests in thehands of about 175 British officers, who constitute the great majority ofthe senior administrative personnel.     If these officers withdraw whenthe Territory achieves independence, there may be an administrativebreakdown.     This would be the more serious in that it is known thatCommunist trained forces are prepared to launch a campaign of terrorism after 1st October.3. In addition, a battalion of Fritish troops (Grenadier Guards)is stationed in the Southern Cameroons.     We have twice stated in public that it will be withdrawn when our trusteeship comes to an end.4. It is against this background that we have to consider proposals that:-(a) We should establish a British Aid Mission in the southern Cameroons which would, in effect, consist of the exist-ing administrative personnel, who would be invited toremain under the aegis of the new Department of technical Co-operation (and, therefore, at the expenseof the United Kingdom Exchequer) for a period of up to two years after independence.(b) We should allow a British battalion to remain for a further period, possibly a year, in order to maintain internal security in the Southern Cameroons during the difficulttransitional period of its absorption in the proposedFederation.
5. The argument in favour of these proposals runs brieflythus:-(a) A breakdown of administration would provide the mostfertile ground for Communist infiltration;   and a communist-dominated Government in this area wouldbe both dangerous to Nigeria and damaging to our international reputation.(b) The Aid Mission offers the best prospect of avoidingthis situation.(c) But the personnel constituting this Mission and their families are unlikely to be willing to remain in theSouthern Cameroons after independence, if theprotection of British troops is withdrawn.(d) In addition, if the battalion is withdrawn, a security&quot;gap&quot; will develop.(e) Therefore, the British battalion should remain, atleast until a locally recruited security force ofbattalion strength has been assembled and trained.6. The arguments against the proposals are partly economic andfinancial, partly military and partly political:-(a)  Economic and Financial(i)     Although the United Kingdom has substantial interests in theSouthern Cameroons export trade in cocoa, timber, palm oil and sheetrubber and the Colonial Development Corporation have a considerableinvestment in the local Development Corporation, our commercial interests in the Territory are not sufficient to warrant the continueddeployment of British forces after independence if there are objectionsto this course on other grounds.(ii)     The cost of assistance on the scale recommended for oneyear might amount to:-Aid Mission  .5 millionUnited Kingdom Battalion   . 4 millionBudget deficit   . 5 millionLocal Security Force  .5 million total  1.9 millions this assumes that, if we provided an Aid Mission, we shouldcontinue, as at present, to finance the Budget deficit and that we shouldalso have to bear the cost of maintaining the locally recruited security force(which would otherwise merely increase the Budget deficit).In present circumstances, however, any addition to our overseas expenditure in unwelcome;  and our efforts should be directed to reducing,rather than increasing, our outlay on military and economic assistant toforeign countries.   Moreover, this expenditure could, in the circumstances described in (b) below, rise rapidly and steeply.
Admiralty House, S. W. 1.12th June, 1961Even if there were no outbreak of terrorism, the position ofthe British battalion would be an invidious and potentially embarrassing one.There is no real precedent for putting British troops under the command of a foreign Government in time of peace;  and we could expect to besharply criticised by our enemies.   Moreover, if relations between mr. Foncha and Mr. Ahidjo deteriorated, and our troops became involvedin a personal struggle for power, our position would become untenable.It would be even worse, however, if terrorism broke out on a more extensive scale than a single battalion could contain.   In those circumstances it might be impracticable to withdraw   the battalion;  and there wouldthen be no alternative to reinforcing it.   But in the light of our other commitments it would be difficult enough to spare one battalion after1st October; to spare more would be virtually impossible.7. There are only two courses open to us:-(a) The first would be to sanction the Aid Mission and to allow the British battalion to remain for a short period (say six months) after1st October, provided that:-(i) We did so in response to a formal request from both theGovernment of the Cameroun Republic and the Government of theSouthern Cameroons.(ii) The responsibilities of its Commanding Officer in relationto both Governments were defined clearly and to our satisfaction.(iii) During this interval the two Governments made a genuine and determined attempt to raise and train a locally recruited security force.Even if we undertook to pay for this force for not more than a year, itstraining should, from the outset, be accepted by the Government of theRepublic (i. e. in effect by the French) as their responsibility.   We couldnot spare the officers and men who would be required to constitute a British Training Mission; and it is in any event right that, if theSouthern Cameroons are to be merged in a French-type federation,military training should also be on French lines.(b) The alternative is to stick to our published declarations andto withdraw from the Southern Cameroons on let October, confiningour assistance to such financial support as we can thereafter afford.H.
