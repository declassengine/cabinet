(61) 89urn MWfcuiBitlM InTOP SECRET Copy Ho.Jt* cabinet economic SITUATIONMeinoyandum by, the Chancellor of the exchequer the pressures on the economy, both from within, and without,are becoming increasingly dangerous.   Home demand is already highand is expected to rise strongly over the next twelve months;   at thesame time our external reserves are declining rapidly - and theextent of that decline has been concealed by the assistance receivedfrom European central banks.   The situation is more serious than atany time during the past ten years.2.      On the domestic front there is a widespread and growing shortageof labour.   Unemployment has fallen to 1. 2 per cent and is likely to fall further.   The number of vacancies is well in excess of the numberof unemployed.   The boom in industrial investment, which has beenbuilding up since late 1959 has not yet reached its peak and willprobably continue into 1962, with increasing pressure on the buildingindustry (already overloaded) and the engineering industry.   Even moreimportant and something which has become much more clearly markedsince the budget, is the uptrend in consumption;   it is now forecast to rise by  600 millions (annual rate) in real terms between the first half of 1961 and the first half of 1962, that is by 4 per cent - an unusuallyhigh rate.   In the last twelve months there has been only a small risein production.   The rise required to meet the increased domestic demand now foreseen, will exceed the rise in productive capacity;the pressure of demand upon man-power capacity will, therefore,increase still further.   Prices have risen, about 2^ per cent in the last twelve months;  with the next wage round promising a 6-7 per cent increase in wage rates, the rise in prices will probably be 3-3^ per cent over the next tv/elve months.3.      Simultaneously with the increase of pressure on our domesticresources, we are faced with a critical external situation.   Sincethe middle of 1959 the balance of payments haa been heavily in deficit.On present expectations the deficit in 1961 will remain high and maywell continue, even if world conditions are favourable, to the end of1962 and beyond.   A succession of adverse balances of this durationis unprecedented in our post-war experience.   This prospect isalarming, to put it mildly.4.      We also face the danger of large continuing withdrawals bysterling and non-sterling countries.   The magnitude of these withdrawalsdepends on the policies we pursue and the confidence that these policiesinspire in the future value of the pound as much as on the needs ofother countries to realise their external assets.   On the basis of our experience in 1957, we must expect that when the pound is undersuspicion, a large proportion of sterling holdings v/ill prove highly
TOP SECRET64volatile and that withdrawals might reach a dangerous scale.   Converseas our past experience has also shown, action that is seen to be bothdetermined and adequate could have a marked effect in the opposite direction.5.      The weakness of our balance of payments is a reflection partly of the pressure of domestic demand and partly of the chronictendency for wages and salaries (and consequentially other incomes)to rise much faster than productivity.   This tendency is itself tosome extent caused by the overload of our economy and the shortageof labour resulting from it.   Whatever else we do, therefore, wemust reduceth %- pressure of home demand and get the trend of ourcosts under control.6.      The scale on which it will be necessary to restrict home demand is substantial.   We cannot hope to wipe out otxx adverseoverseas balance without releasing resources on at least aco liviparable scale and we must also generate a surplus sufficientto allow us to repay our debts and finance our normal outflow of long-term capital and aid.   Simply to make room for these twoobjectives implies a reduction of prospective home demand that mightbe ultimately of the order of an annual rate of  500 millions.7.      Steps must therefore be taken both to alleviate the shorter-term pressure on the balance of payments and to improve the trendover the longer-term.   The measures I propose are directed towardsthese aims without arresting the growth of the economy.   They imply a check in the growth of Government expenditure and in private spendingon consumer goods;  they would limit the growth of consumption overthe next year while permitting industrial investment to expand withoutthe adverse consequences for the balance of payments that would otherwise follow.8.      My proposals are as follows:-(a) Measures to reduce overseas Government expenditure.(b) Measures to reduce private expenditure overseas.(c) Measures to reduce home demand in the public sector.(d) Measures to reduce home demand in the private sector.(e) Measures to restrain the growth of wages and salaries and so to improve our international competitive position.Measures to Reduce Government Expenditure Overseas9.      My objective here is to secure an aggregate saving of 100 millions for the year 1962/63.to maintain our troops on the Continent under N-* A..,T, 0. Ccrr.ime.nd.10.ence-2-
(b) Other Overseas Military Expenditure.   I further propose thatthe total of our overseas military expenditure should be reduced fromthe present level of about  235 millions a year to about  200 millions a year (this saving to be in addition to the saving we secure on (a)above).   The possible means of doing this are already under examina-fcion, but it is clear that it will involve a reduction in our defence commitments.   As the savings cannot be achieved quickly, I considerthat we must reach decisions as soon as possible.1L     Aid to Under - dey eloped^countries sOur present policy is to stabilise expenditure under the aid programme within the range of  190 -200 millions a year (as comparedwith actual expenditure of  150 millions last year).   I propose thata new limit of  180 millions a year be set.   But we can keep within this limit only if we refuse to undertake any new aid commitmentswhatever, and refrain from re-allocating any savings on expenditure under existing commitments.   On paper, existing commitments will result in expenditure of over  180 millions both this year and next;but I believe that this excess could be avoided by taking advantageof possible savings which may arise.   I realise that this means thatwe shall not be able to do as much as we should like, to help,inter alia, the Colonial territories emerging into independence.12.     I propose that other civil expenditure overseas (e. g. diplomaticadministrative and information) should be cut for 1962/63 by10 per cent below its present level of  43 millions.Measures to Reduce Private  expenditure Overseas13.     Import ControlsA plan has been worked out which I will mention orally.14.    F;rjyater TjravelAt present  160 millions is spent on travel (including businesstravel).    The new &quot;travel year&quot; begins on 1st November.   It is exceedingly difficult to make a change in the middle of the travel year.It is for consideration whether we make a cut for the next travelyear.   To limit the tourist allowance to  100 would not save much but might be of psychological value.   A limit of  50 might save a sumof the order of  20 millions. The announcement of a prospectivelimitation would lead to considerable forestalling.15.     LegaciesThere are various other points to be looked at - e. g. legacies,remittances, and the export of valuables.   But I have no proposalsfor immediate action.16.    Direct Investment in the NonySterlint; AreaThis accounts for a growing part ( 100 millions in I960) of our overseas investment.   At present such investment is normally allowed,and for the most part there is no enforcement of the remittanceof profits to this country by the overseas subsidiary.
(a) I propose to give instructions that direct investment in theNon-sterling Area should be permitted by the Treasury only in cases which are of special benefit to the United Kingdom balance of payments and to the economy, with a warning that many worthwhile proposals will have to be refused or deferred.(b) I am also considering whether anything can be done to improveremittance of profits made overseas.   I am doubtful about re-introducing the former control in this matter, since it was neverreally workable or effective.   But there may be some case forexhortation to those concerned, not necessarily to remit surplusprofits back to this country, but at least to convert them into sterling.In this connection I shall need to reconsider before next year theeffects on the reserves of the Overseas Trading Corporation arrange-m ents for income tax and profits tax.17.    Direct investment, iaa t a Sterling AreaI have considered whether investment and indeed travel andother expenditure by United Kingdom residents in the Sterling area should be restricted.   In order to do this Exchange Control wouldhave to be imposed on all outward payments from the United Kingdom -a step which we have never taken even during the War. Such a measureat the present time would drastically reduce international confidence in sterling.   It would also seriously damage the Commonw althrelationship at a time when our colleagues are touring the Comrnon-wsalth to put the arguments for our joining Europe.   I do not proposetherefore to take action on this except perhaps in the form of a generalexhortation to companies to restrict all overseas investment toprojects of special importance.1&quot;&apos;     InvisiblesGenerally I have been considering whether there is anythingwe can do quickly to reverse the decline of  200 millions in our netinvisible earnings over the past few years.   Apart from Governmentoverseas expenditure (paragraph 9), and travel (paragraph 14), I see no scope for direct action which would have early and helpful effects.But our payments abroad for services, including shipping, should fallas a result of the measures I am taking to restrain the pressure of demand in the economy.Measures to^Reduce. Home..Demand in the Public Sector19.     Public expenditure must certainly be in a position to make a statement thatwill convince public opinion here and our creditors and others abroadthat we intend to take effective action to deal with the growth ofpublic expenditure.I have circulated separately the report (C. (6l) 80), which theCabinet commisiapecl   on 28th March, on the &quot;five-year plan&quot; for public expenditure of all kinds - Government, local authorities,national insurance, nationalised industries.
To take effective action will clearly involve difficultdecisions, which will take some time to work out in detail.But I must be enabled to announce at the very least our intention of keeping the growth of public expenditure in step withthat of G. N. P. (see the last paragraph of my covering note forthe &quot;plan&quot;);  with some statements about what is involved:-(i)  Fully effective implementation of the White Paper policy on nationalised industries, with the freedom on charges whichthe Cabinet agreed (C. C. (6l) 19th C onclusions) we should announce at an appropriate moment.(ii)  More stringent criteria for assistance to industry - and, Iwould hope, some specific example, e. g. abandonment ofthe supersonic airliner project.(iii) Inability to accept significant increase in the cost ofagricultural support.(iv) Acceptance of a slower rate of growth of social servicesthan had previously been planned.Defence and overseas aid would, for the purpose of this statement,be covered by paragraphs 11 and 12 above.20. ^Public investment as regards public investment, I shall have to ask (subjectof course to (i) above, which must be regarded as fundamental) that my colleagues should take whatever steps are required (including,perhaps, in some cases, modifying promises which have alreadybeen made to local authorities and others) to ensure that the amountof investment work done in 1962-63 does not exceed the minimumlevels laid down by the Cabinet last December (C. C.(60) 62ndConclusions).   This will serve to keep public investment under control,and would accord with what we said in last November&apos;s White paper on Public Investment about short-term adjustments in public investment.I must, however, also warn my colleagues that it may benecessary as the balance of payments situation develops to reduceinvestment expenditure in 1962/63 even below the level laid down.This would require a general withdrawal of authorisations already given to local authorities and other public bodies and a new controlof building starts at a much lower level.It will certainly be necessary, as part of the process ofmoderating the growth of public expenditure, to spread the investment plans that Departments at present have in mind over a longer period.There is no doubt that the necessary drastic modifications ofour major spending policies will impose pressure upon the relationsbetween the Government and the local authorities.   To get acceptanceand support for this action, and to promote restraint in all public spending for the immediate future, the Prime Minister has agreed tosend a message to Government Departments, local authorities and other public bodies.
Measures to.jlei-:iice Home Demand in the Private Sector21.    Action in this field must naturally be concentrated primarily on checking the growth of private consumption.   For this purposethere are the new fiscal regulators, which will be available when theFinance Bill becomes law - i. e. on present expectations on 19th July.I shall then be able, if I so decide, to impose the Customs and Excisesurchage either at the full rate of 10 per cent or at some lower figure;and to combine this with the imposition of the employers&apos; surcharSeeither at the full rate of 4s. per employee per week, or at some lower rate.   It is worth remembering that the two regulators used in con-junction, and at the full rates, would reduce spending power at anannual rate of  400 millions.Growing private investment is, of course, welcome in so faras it increases our productive capacity, and I would not advocate theremoval or reduction of the investment allowances.   At the same time,the investment boom is imposing a severe strain on the building industry.In the long run we may have to consider some means of controlling thedemand on the building industry, iflnot by direct physical controls thenby controlling the sources of finance.   This however would require a great deal of study as well as legislation;  in the meantime we mayhave to consider relying on the weapons-row available to us for res-tricting credit generally.   These are:-(a) Credit restriction; Hire Prchase regulationsWe could tighten the hire purchase regulations either by increasing the required deposit from the present 20 per cent tosome higher figure, or by reducing the period of payment from thepresent three years to some shorter period.    The objection to this isthat it would bear particularly heavily on certain industries (motorcars, radio and television and other consumer durables) which do notappear generally to be overloaded at present and which would also beaffected by the Customs and Excise surcharge.(b) ^IlsML^iS3ilijS^i2Sl^^dSS!L^SZMi MMThe recent figures have shown that advances associated withconsumer spending which had been declining, have now turned upwards.Although the banks are now in a pretty tight position, I am considering what it may be desirable to do in order to tighten the position further.The main steps which it may be necessary to take for this purposeconsist of either a further call for special deposits, or a request tothe banks, or both.(c) Credit restriction- dnterejst RatesAn upward movement of Bank Rate is an obvious possibilitywhich I shall be considering with the Governor of the Bank of England.(d) Control of Capital IssuesI shall also be considering the revival of Capital Issues control which has been in abeyance since February, 1959.   This would meet with public criticism because it was not a very effective control and did not affect those with liquid resources.   On the other hand its reimpositionmight have some psychological value.   The directive to the Capital
Issues Committee might require them to scrutinise with particularseverity borrowing for property development and for purposesassociated with private consumption - e. g. , by hire purchase financehouses.   If this were done, we should also have to consider requestingthe banks and the insurance companies to restrict their lending for similar purposes.Mgasujres, jtp Re strict the Growth of Wages and Salaries22.    This is one of the most important elements in the whole situa-tion.   In the long run we must try to link consideration of wages withthe problem of economic growth.   Indeed, the essential point is thatif incomes and spending power - of which wages and salaries arethe main but by no means the only constituent - rise faster thannational productivity (or gross national product per worker), we are bound to remain in the spiral of rising costs and prices;   and that,unless this fact is recognised when incomes are being determined,we shall go stumbling on from one crisis to the next, until we areforced into devaluation and all the consequences both to Britain&apos;sliving standards and to the sterling area.The Government have no authority over wage negotiations.Nevertheless it is become increasingly urgent that we should exercise as much influence as we can.   Wage rates in the private sector are of the greatest importance to us, not only because of their effect on the- economy generally, but also because of their repercussions on wages in the public sector and hence on Government expenditure.In the public sector for which we have responsibility, I am, as my colleagues know, very greatly disturbed by the proposed teachers&apos;pay settlements, involving a total extra cost Gf  65 millions a yearand for England and Wales a rise of I64 per cent.It is for consideration whether the Government should give a-learer lead affecting the key wage settlements, both in the public sector and in private industry.Should we be prepared to say in every important dispute whatwould be the limit in wage increases which would, in our view, be compatible with the public interest?   Should we on the other handadopt some kind of &quot;guiding light&quot; procedure?   We should not beable to enforce any of this, nor should we try to do so, but a clear statement of what the public interest requires would give the employersa standard, and would giidepublic opinion.Economic Growth23.    We must at the same time make a constructive and positivestatement  about the future development of the economy.   It is clearthat a solution to our problem can lie only in a more rapid growth of output per worker (as is indeed postulated in the expenditure paper)and in greater competitive power throughout.We shall not get competitiveness    or growth or solvency unlessthe authority of the Government and the power of the State are used to stimulate competitiveness and to get an efficient distribution of
resources of labour and capital - and not, as so often happens, forfeather bedding.   The measures to do this will take time to V/ork out and I shall shortly be circulating a paper to my colleagxies accordingly.It may well be desirable, moreover, to develop such measures jointly with industry and labour (in some ways not unlike the Monnet Plan) -rather than try to carry them on our own,A statement of these longer-term objectives, and an initiativeto work out the implications jointly with industry and labour, is anessential part of any early announcement, which would otherwiseseem both to public opinion here and overseas, as promising little hope for improved performance in the future.24. We should also consider whether our present powers to control the economy are sufficient.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.28th June, 1961-8-
