TheCommittee&apos;s report is annexed for consideration by the Cabinet.2.     The Committee have taken into account the views expressed tothem by the new Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the British travel and Holidays Association, Sir William Mabane and Lord Geddesrespectively.    Our impression is that this new leadership will infusefresh vigour into the Association, and in paragraphs 43 and 44 of our report are listed a number of directions in which the new &quot;management&quot;is trying to make the Association more effective.3.     The Committee&apos;8 recommendations were for the most partagreed unanimously but, where this is not so, the dissent is expressedin the relevant paragraphs.4.     I ask the Cabinet to approve the Committee&apos;s conclusions andrecommendations, which are summarised in Part II of their report, andto invite the Ministers concerned to put them into effect.Office of the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, 3.

&quot;Need Britain be so^ Alpof?&quot;(Headline to a &quot;trfimes&apos;&apos;* ArtYcle&quot; \yy&quot;yi, Henri Fayat,Belgian Foreipji Trade Minister. 1957/T958)PART ITERMS OF REFERENCE AND MEMBERSHIPWe were appointed on 22nd December, i960, to considermeans of increasing the United kingdom&apos;s earnings from overseasvisitors to this country.     The membership of the Committeeand the list of other Ministers whose help we have had are shown at Appendix A.     We have heard the views &apos;of the chairman and Deputy Chairman of the British Travel and HolidayAssociation (3.T.H.A.).R^GROUND2.     In 196b* the number of holiday, social and businessvisitors to Britain was nearly 1,700,000.     Within this figure foreign holiday-makers and the like topped the millionmark for the first time.     A quarter of a million foreignbusinessmen and nearly i).00,b00 Commonwealth visitors (both for business and pleasure) also came here.     Over the last fewyears the numbers have grown almost in geometric progressionand I960 saw a larger increase than any recent year.     further details are given in Appendix B.3.     Our earnings from overseas visitors increased from 21 millions in 19h7 to  153 millions in 1939 and  136 millionsir. i960, quite apart from earnings by British carriers.     In1959 only chemicals, electrical machinery and appliances,motor cars and iron and steel yielded larger overseas earningsthan tourism.h.     The Government have helped..     Their grant to the B.T.H.A.was increased in 1959 from  800,000 a year to  1,050,(500;no-passport trips from France have been introduced;    we nowaccept identity cards instead of passports in the case ofvisitors from several Western European countries;   we haveabolished the visa for visitors from many countries;    duty-freespirits are on sale at major airports;    and summer time is to beextended this year by six weeks.     Before the 1962 touristseason there is likely to be an increase in the maximum permit te;&apos;-size of motor coaches in order to allow more foreign vehiclesto use our roads.5*     But no less than seven Western European countriesachieved a greater rate of increase than the United kingdom in tourist traffic in 1959.     The pressure for more government action continues.     We have taken as our starting point amemorandum by the B.T.H.A. on the requirements of the touristindustry in 1961.     We have had in mind your directive on exports of 27th September, i960, in which you asked your colleagues to ensure that they and their Departments should set aside as ftr as possible Departmental and domesticinterests that conflicted with the main objective of increasing our overseas earnings.
PUBLICITY OVERSEAS FOR HOLIDAYS III BRITAIN6.     The instrument chosen &quot;by the Government to publicise3ritain as a tourist attraction is the B.T.H.A.     It has to face many difficulties, our reputation for poor weather anddull food and fierce competition among them.   - But it isclear from reports from our embassies that the B.T.H.A.,often helped by British Railways and the British airways corporations, makes an impact in those countries where it iseffectively represented.     It devotes four-fifths of itsbudget to overseas advertising, to literature and to maintaining offices abroad, although no more than 20 per cent of this is spent in Western Europe.7.     More people in Western Europe would consider cominghere for their holidays if the B.I.H.A. could step up itsEuropean campaign, which hitherto has tended to he subordinate to the campaign in America.     One quarter of all touristscoming to the United Kingdom in i960 were Americans.     Halfthe overseas expenditure in Scotland in 1959 was from the dollar area.     Despite the     relatively small campaign inEurope, l+k per cent of our overseas visitors came from therelast year, but this seems capable of being sharply steppedup.     The hotel trade in this country is slow to give facilities for the &quot;all-in&quot; holidays that attract tens of thousands of British people to the Continent.     Some &quot;all-in&quot;holidays are centred on Harrogate, with trips to the LakeDistrict, York and so on;   but this is probably becauseHarrogatu, with a surplus of hotels, welcomes this type oftraffic.     We believe that the B.T.H.A. should be encouraged to presc; the British hotel trade to cater more for this typeof business.     It should also encourage travel agents abroad to take advantage of United Kingdom accommodation notified to it ns ovnilnhlu&quot; tor toiG purpose,,8.     Valuable publicity for Britain as a tourist attractionis given indirectly &quot;by tours abroad of high quality Britishballet and theatre companies and orchestras and by first class exhibits at trade fairs.     We think that these activities should be maintained and, if possible, increased.-2-

Dover - 549,000Harwich - 132,00098,00081,000b0,000Folkestone        - 98,000Southampton      - 81,000TewhavenAll these are owned by the British Transport Commission(B.T.C.)  except Dover, which is owned by the Dover HarbourBoard and run partly by them and partly by the B.T.G.10.    Major improvements are required urgently at all these places.      Dover needs better accommodation for cars detained&quot;by the Customs,  improved train-ferry terminals and betterpassenger facilities generally.      Harwich needs betteraccommodation on shore for passengers, an improved roadapproach to the station, more station platforms and largercustoms and immigration halls and offices.      There ought tobe a brand-new passenger terminal at Folkestone.      Southampton,(whose transatlantic and ocean terminals are of post-warconstruction) needs better facilities for its cross-Channelservices.     More should be done for motorists and othervisitors at Newhaven.     At Greenock, which is owned by theGreenock Harbour Trust, the 16,000 transatlantic passengersin 1960 had to be taken by tender from their ships to thepier (which needs repairs estimated to cost  375*000).Passenger facilities on the pier are ninety-two years old.11.    There are plans to remedy some of the deficiencies at these ports at some time in the future.     But little is likelyto be done either at the Channel ports or at Harwich until the fate of the Channel Tunnel project is known and the work can find a place in the B.T.C.&apos;s investment programme.      Little islikely at Greenock because of the lack of funds available tothe Harbour Trust.      We therefore recommend that:-(a) An early decision should he taken, if possible onthe Channel Tunnel in order to remove the uncertainty about the future of the Channel -ports and Harwich.(b) In the light of this decision the 3.T.C.  should beashed to consider the importance of devotingresources to improvements at these ports as comparedwith other projects.(c) The Greenock Harbour Trust should be informed thatin the Government&apos;s view they should make everyeffort to provide more satisfacto!^ arrangements and facilities for the   reception of passengers.FACILITIES AT PORTS AiW AIRPORTSSeaports9.      Once persuaded to come here,, a visiting tourist&apos;s- first -and most lasting - impression may be of the Admiralty Pier atDover or, if he is an unlucky American, the Princes Pier atGreenock.      The number of foreigners using the main ports of entry in 1960 was as&apos; follows:-
London Airport12.    More foreign visitors (769,000) arrived at London Airportin I960 than at all these six seaports together.      Thefacilities in the central building at London Airport are reasonably satisfactory.      Those on the North side, wherelong-distance flights are handled, though wholly inadequateat -present, will be improved when a new building now under construction is ready late this year,Passenger Service Charge13.    The B.T.H.A. has recommended the removal or absorptionin the fare of the passenger service charge of 7/6d. per headat United Kingdom airports.      We are satisfied that it isnot a significant deterrent to tourism.IMMIGRATION,  CUSTOMS AND QUARANTINE CONTROLSHi.    As soon as the foreign visitor sets foot here he isconfronted by the immigration control, the customs control(which is of particular significance if he has a car) and,if he tries to bring a pet animal with him, the quarantinecontrol.     The cumulative effect of these encounters withofficialdom may be formidable, and may deter him from cominghere again.     Moreover, the visitor on his return home no doubt-tells his friends of the treatment received, and we may thuslose not only further custom from him but potential customfrom a much wider circle of foreigners.      We have thereforecarefully considered whether the load can be&apos;lightened.Immigrati on Contr011-5.    Like the returning British subject, the foreigner has toproduce his passport or a similar document.      But at many portshe has to wait his turn in a separate queue and at all portshe has to satisfy the immigration officer that he is a genuinetourist or businessman by answering questions about the purpose and length of his visit.      The adverse effects on tourism ofthis interrogation, which in most cases takes very little time,should not be exaggerated.      Of about 1,730,000 foreignerswho arrived in this country in 1960, less than 2,500 were refused permission to land, and these were mostly people who&quot;were seeking to evade employment restrictions or were -personallyundesirable.      But the Foreign Office view - not wholly shared by the B.T.H.A.  - is that the segregation of British passportholders from the rest is strongly resented by many foreigners,who see it as a typical example of our insular attitude.This system has also brought us under fire in the Council ofEurope and other international gatherings.     The onlyjustification for segregation which most of us can accept isthat it enables immigration officers, without delaying Britishsubjects, to check the names of foreigners against a list ofcriminals and other undesirable people whom we wish to keep under -police supervision.     We have been informed that this practice yields useful results both to the police and to thesecurity service, and, because of this, we do not feel ableto recommend that the segregation should in all cases-beended.     But where the improvement of physical facilities orthe small numbers involved at ports of entry make it possibleto abolish segregation, this should be done.      Other countries-4-SlCHiT
in Western Europe seem willing to accept a much looser formof control at the points of entry - apparently without serious effects - in the interests of their tourist trade.But many of them have much stricter methods of internalpolice supervision.16.    A special feature of the system of immigration control is the requirement that foreign workers must produce labourpermits, which are forwarded to them by intending british employers.before they leave their own country.      The B.T.H.A.originally asked for some alleviation of restrictions on theconditions of entry of certain ski I&quot;1 d workers for the hoteland catering industry so that British hoteliers could engageskilled hotel labour on the spot during their visits to theContinent.      In our view the present system of labour permitsdoes not impose unreasonable restrictions.      We understandthat the British Hotels and Restaurants Association (theemployers&apos; organisation mainly concerned) is not asking forany relaxation of the kind suggested and that the B.T.H.A.is unlikely to pursue the point,*Customs Control17&apos;    After satisfjring the immigration officer,  the foreignvisitor must pass through the customs control.      In theordinary way this causes little trouble and does not takemuch time, though the Foreign Office think that it is often aforbidding experience for him.      At Dover the average time taken to pass a shipload of passengers through the customscontrol is forty-five minutes, and the corresponding figure for a planeload of passengers at London Airport is sevenminutes.     Where there is a problem it is more one of premisesthan of proceciure.The Garnet18,    The visitor with a car faces a more serious obstacle.He can only secure exemption from import duty and purchase taxfor twelve months if he produces&apos;a carnet or triptyque,      Thisis a document which he obtains, for a small fee, from a motoringorganisation either in his own country or at the port ofdisembarkation here.      It gives particulars of the car andenables the Customs to discover in due course whether it hasbeen retained beyond the permitted period.     Under aninternational guarantee system the Customs can then, ifnecessary, recover the duty and tax from a motoring organisation which acts as a guarantor.19.    All Western European countries except Britain haveabolished the carnet system, largely because of the sheerweight of administration involved in checking the much larger number of cars which cross their frontiers.      The StandingJoint Committee of the British motoring organisations states,as a result of enquiries made of certain foreign motoringorganisations in Europe, that the abolition of the carnetsystem has had no noticeable effect on the revenue of the-5-
countries concerned.      The Customs and Excise, however, haveno reason to believe that this is generally true.      Ourretention of this system creates a had impression, and thereis evidence that it constitutes a deterrent to would-betourists.      They do not like it and. they often say so.     Wehave examined possible alternative systems of control, suchas stamping the motorist&apos;s passport, branding all cars onwhich import duty and purchase tax have been paid, anddemanding evidence of the payment of duty and tax before a vehicle is registered or re-licensed by the licensing authorities.     But we have reached the conclusion that these alternatives would be administratively cumbersome orexpensive and would fail to provide a complete defence againstevasion of duty and tax.20.    The    Economic Secretary, Treasury,  thinks that the carnetsystem should be retained, but that, to reduce the foreignersirritation, the forms at present used should be simplified.The Minister of State, Board of Trade, believes that thesmuggling of cars yields so little profit that the carnet system can safely be abolished without more ado.   &quot; The rest of us(the Economic Secretary dissenting), would like the risk to therevenue put to the test by a suspension of the system for atrial period of two years.      This should be accompanied by astatement that the system would be reintroduced if suspensionresulted in a significant evasion of duty and tax.21.    The effects on the revenue in the trial period of suspensioncould be measured with reasonable accuracy from a centralregister maintained by the Customs, giving; brief details of cars imported and sip orted by visitors from abroad.      these could be obtained from a simple form completed by,  or for,each tourist, possibly in advance, as is done in some othercountries.      Alternatively, if the tourists had to produce aregistration document, Customs Officers could extract theinformation without undue delay.      The registration documentwould also help Customs Officers to detect improper attemptsby United Kingdom residents to evade duty and tax on importedcars by posing as visitors.      Cars irregularly retained, ordisposed of, in this country would, be liable to forfeiture,if traced, even from an innocent owner.Quarantine Control22.    The tourist coming here for two or three weeks cannotkeep his dog or cat with him, since these animals arequarantined for six months when they arrive.     This practice,which has kept us free from rabies for over thirty years,has been endorsed by an expert committee of the World health organisation, and other countries have been recommended toadopt it.      We are clear that the interests of tourism wouldnot&quot;justify a relaxation of the quarantine restrictions onpets.
ACCOMMODATION    -Hotels23.    Unless he hooks a long time in advance, the foreigntourist may not find a room in an hotel here.     The B.T.H.A.forecast that, if the number of tourists arriving inGreat Britain continued to increase at the present average rateof 10 per cent a year, there would be a shortage of 18,000good-class hotel bedrooms by 1965? of which 13,000 would bein London.      Some progress has been made recently with theconstruction of new hotels in London, but, even so, thenumber of new bedrooms in 1961 will not meet the estimatedshortage in I960.     The shortage of suitable rooms compelsmany United States travel agencies either to omit Great Britainfrom their European tours, or to limit the stay of United Statevisitors to London to two days.     A sample survey conductedfor the B.T.H.A. in 1959 showed that at least 1L\. per cent of all visitors were unable to find the standard of accommodation they required.     We are convinced by this andother evidence that an increase in the amount of suitablehotel accommodation could make a greater contribution to theUnited Kingdom&apos;s foreign exchange earnings from tourism than any other single factoro2h.    We have examined a number of suggestions made by theB.T.H.A. for financial assistance or greater fiscal relief to the hotel trade of the kind given in some other countries.We are agreed that no justification exists for giving morefavourable depreciation allowances on plant, equipment andfurnishings,  special relief from purchase tax on hotelfurnishings and equipmentj or relief from rates.     We think,however, that, further consideration should be given to two ways in which hotels (including motels, where we lag farbehind many other countries) might be stimulated to increasethe number of additional bedrooms available for foreignvisitors,25.    First, we recommend that an appropriate form of tax relief should be given to encourage the building of new hotel sand the extension of old hotels by the provision of newbedrooms and bathrooms.     This might be effected by applying the existing industrial building allowance to hotels,  though we do not wish to limit our recommendation to any particular form of tax relief.     While we think that such relief should only be given to hotels proper (as distinct from boarding-houses), we do not consider that it is practicable to makeany distinction between those hotels which cater primarily for overseas visitors and the remainder.      Indeed, the provision ofmore hotel accommodation, for British tourists would by itselftend to lessen the load on accommodation suitable for overseasvisitors.     The Economic Secretary, Treasury dissents from thisrecommendation, mainly on the grounds that it would involvea discriminatory tax relief in favour of certain capitalexpenditure incurred on a selected class of commercialbuildings used by one section of a particular trade    and thatit would generate pressure for concessions to others which itwould be difficult to withstand.26.    Secondly, while we appreciate the difficulties of makinglong-term finance available to hotel developers at rates ofinterest less than the current rate, we think that exchequer loans at the ruling rate of interest would in presentconditions stimulate hotel development.      Such loans mightbe made through an independent institution which would be in abetter position than the Government to discriminate between different types of hotel project (e.g. in favour of thoselikely to cater for the foreign tourist).    The Economic Secreta;.maintains that new public expenditure, by way of assistance to private industry, would be objectionable at the present time...-  -7-   &apos;..
Tourist (Scotland) Fund27o   We have considered in outline a scheme prepared bySir Hugh Fraser, who is directing the Scottish Tourist Board&apos;campaing to expand tourism in the Highlands, for the establish-ment of a Tourist (Scotland) Fund.    The Fund would he applied inthe main towards financing the improvement and expansion ofhotels, etc., grants to local tourist associations, localamenities and specific publicity schemes.    It would he raisedby contributions levied on hotels and boarding houses andassessed by reference to &quot;sleeper-nights&quot; and standard of accommodation.    Hotels and boarding houses would be registeredto ensure payment of the contributions:    the register might also be used to maintain minimum standards.    The scheme would,require statutory sanction.28.   Although there might be political objections to a schemeinvolving a compulsory levy, registration, inspection and penal-ties, the merit of this proposal is that it would provide sub-stantial funds for urgently needed improvements from non-Government sources and would be a useful example of self helpby. a trade.   While such a scheme might not find acceptancethroughout Great Britain, it might well prove acceptable andworkable in Scotland, where the proportion of tourist to non-tourist hotels is much higher and the benefits of tourism tothe country&apos;s economy as a whole are more obvious.   We recommendthat the possibility of giving effect to a scheme on these linesby legislation should be further explored if, but only if, theGovernment can be assured that it has the support of the greatmajority of hoteliers in Scotland.    The Scottish Tourist board are about to arrange confidential consultations with theappropriate committees of the British Hotels and RestaurantsAssociation and the Catering Association.    If the result ofthese is favourable, they will consult the local touristassociations on which boarding house keepers are represented.Accommodation for young people29.    Youth has an insatiable appetite for foreign travel.    Lastyear young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-fouraccounted for half the total of 750,000 visitors from western europe.    But the B.T.H.A. has told us that many more would comeif there were a more plentiful supply of the cheap accommodationthey need, especially in London.    The tourist income brought byyoung visitors may be relatively low, but the good impressionformed by a successful holiday in youth will persuade many toreturn with their families in later years.30.   We have explored the possibility of using universitystudents&apos; hostels to accommodate young foreign visitors in the summer vacation.   This has been done successfully for some years in Stockholm.    But we were informed that existing studentaccommodation in Britain is already in full use for most of theyear.    However, we recommend that the Government should try to persuade the university authorities to agree that a hostel among those to be built within the expanding university building programme should be reserved for use by young foreign touristsin the summer vacation.31.    Similar use might be made of the accommodation in suitablylocated teacher training colleges and independent boarding-schools.    Although the summer holidays often provide the onlytime when extensive maintenance and redecoration of school buildings can be carried out, the income provided by youngforeign visitors might outweigh the administrative and practicaldifficulties involved.   We recommend therefore that this ideashould be explored further by the Minister of Education inconsultation with the B.T.H.A., the Headmasters&apos; Conference andthe local authorities and voluntary bodies concerned.-8-
CARAVAN. AND CAMPING.......SITES32.    In recent years there has &quot;been a revolution amongholiday habits    on the Continent..     Camping is no longer thepreserve of the young.     Modern camping equipment and theexistence of a large number of well prepared sites in western Europe are attracting a growing number of families of all ages to take up this cheap, healthy and no longeruncomfortable form of holiday.     An informative guidelisting a large number of camping sites in Western Europegives a further stimulus to this movement.33.    Surveys carried cut by the B.T.H.A. show that much more could be done to encourage camping and caravan holidays inthis country.     Better facilities and publicity could bring a rapid expansion of this form of tourism, which would notcompete for the limited supply of more exxoensive types of accommodation needed for our wealthier visitors.     We need notonly more sites but more information about their locationand their amenities.      It should also be made easier for european visitors to book accommodation on the sites *     TheB.T.H.A. should encourage private enterprise to develop these facilities in the main.tourist areas and on the routes tothem.     In particular, we think that more camping and caravansites should be provided in London and the National parks and that the Minister of Housing and Local Government mightdiscuss this question with the London County Council andthe National Parks Commission.     The Ministry of Housing andLocal Government have, however, made the reservation that,in view of the small scale of the National Parks and their use &quot;by many of our own people, the contribution they could make to our earnings from overseas visitors would be marginal,while any expansion of camping and caravan facilities in them would evoke strong protest.THE HOLIDAY SEASON3h*    The report of an interdepartmental committee of officials on the extension of the summer holiday season has been considereby the Home Affairs Committee, who invited the President ofthe Board of Trade to prepare a document to serve as a basis for confidential discussions with the main interests concerned(H&apos;.A.(61) 3rd Meeting, Item 5).     This question raises manyissues which fall outside our terms of reference;   but it isclear that if congestion can be reduced at the peak of the holiday season the foreign tourist will be assisted to find the accommodation he wants.INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTRE35.   Because of the lack of proper facilities, we are notgetting our full share of international conferences, which nowplay an important part in tourist traffic.      The B.T.H.A.considers that London needs a centre providing accommodation for up to 5,000 people, and incorporating good class hotelfacilities for not less than 5^0 people.HI
36.    In 1955 a working party of officials rejected a proposalto &quot;build in London a permanent conference centre big enough for the United Nations General- Assembly, though it thoughtthat there was a case for building a smaller centre, sufficientto take conferences of up to 50*2 delegates.     The capital cost of such a centre would probably be about  2 millions andthere might well be an annual deficit on its running costs.After considering this report the Cabinet decided that theproposal for a smaller centre should be re-examined at alater date.     We recommend that the report of the working party in 1955 should be brought up-to-date by officials underMinistry of Works chairmanship, so that the question can beconsidered further by Ministers.AMENITIES FOR TOURISTS37*   A recent survey by the B.T.H.A. of foreign tourists inBournemouth revealed that many of them were dissatisfied withthe lack of entertainment at night in tourist centres outside london.     This is mainly a matter for private enterprise;but we believe that there are some things the Government can do to make the activities open to tourists in this countrymore interesting and more varied.Ancient Monuments and Historic Buildings38.    Features .of historical importance in this country areperhaps the main attraction to foreign tourists, particularly those from the United States.    One way in which ancient monuments and historic buildings can be made more interestingis by flood-lighting, and, within the limited resources available to them, the Ministry of Works do what they can.As well as flood-lighting famous buildings like the Tower ofLondon, they encourage local authorities xo flood-lightbuildings and monuments in their areas and give them technicaladvice.     The Ministry of Works are also improving the presentation to the public of selected monuments and buildings in their care:    receipts from admission charges and the saleof guide books, etc.,    rose appreciably in i960 at thosemonuments which were given special attention and publicity.We believe that the work done in these fields is a valuableencouragement to tourism, and we recommend that the flood-lighting and presentation of historic buildings and ancient monuments should be developed, even if this means some modestincrease in Government expenditure.National Parks39*    The National Parks are well-known to British tourists but more could be done to attract foreign visitors to them.     this might help to reduce the pressure on the congested holidaycentres where accommodation is scarce.     The National ParkAuthorities have powers to provide accommodation and refreshmentfor visitors, camping and caravan sites and car parking places and can also improve waterways for sailing, boating, bathing,and fishing. &apos; An Exchequer grant of 75 per cent is availabletowards the cost of land and building for these purposes, and up to &quot;00 per cent in certain circumstances for the improvementof waterways.     But not much use has been made of these powersso far, although expenditure on grant-earning projects increased from  21 ,000 in 1959/60 to about  68,000 in 1964/6-], and isexpected to reach well over  100,000 in 1961/62.     The provisionof more organised facilities for open-air recreation would help to make the National Parks more attractive to tourists, butcare mus- be taken to ensure that these facilities do not spoiltheir natural beauty.

The main functions of the B.T.H.A,    are to attractvisitors from overseas to this country - both for tourism andfor business reasons - and to try to improve standards here sothat they are well received and accommodated.     Its work is directed by a Board consisting of a Chairman and up to twenty-Uhree members.     About half the members represent particular interests in the tourist trade - hotels, caterers, brewers,travel agents, transport.     There is a staff of about 180 inthe United Kingdom, apart from those in eleven offices overseas(of which five are in the United States and Canada).k1o     The B.T.H0A0 derives about four-fifths of its income from a Government grant-in-aid and the balance from subscriptions-ticns, donations, advertising revenue, sale of publicationsand other miscellaneous sources.     The grant-in-aid was fixed in 1959/60 at a maximum of  1,050,000 per annum for three years to meet criticisms from the Public Accounts Committee that theAssociation was receiving insufficient financial support fromits members, it was arranged that the grant should be made upof a block grant diminishing by  5,000 each year plus amatching grant of  1 for each  1 received from subscriptionsand donations during the previous financial year.     The block grant amounted to  970,000 in 1960/61 and will fall to 965,000 in 1961/62.     The Select Committee on Estimates in.1960 recommended that the subscription rates of localauthorities should be increased.     In 1959/60 the total ofsubscriptions and donations (other than the grant-in-aid) y/as 80,000, of which the local authorities contributed  36,000*k3.     We have not attempted to conduct a detailed enquiry intothe organisation and effectiveness of the Association at thevery moment when a new Chairman and Deputy Chairman,Sir William Mabane and Lord Geddes respectively, are themselvesconducting a reappraisal of its policies, staffing and methods.Prom our formal meeting with them and from other informal discussions between our Chairman and Sir William Mabane wehave derived a strong impression that the new leadership willinfuse fresh vigour and a stronger sense of realism into theAssociation, which should lead in turn to a more determined effort to develop ways of helping itself.k3.     There are a number of directions in which the impact ofthe new leadership is already being felt -(a)    Sir William Mabane has started a series of discussions with local authorities with the object of&apos; persuadinthem that the value of the B.ToHoA.&apos;s v/ork in bringing income -both from tourists and business visitors - to their areasjustifies an appreciable increase in their subscriptions.Success in this campaign would broaden the basis of theAssociation^ income and provide the resources for a significandevelopment of its work;-11-
(b) The terms of employment of a number of the staffof the Association are being improved in order to reduce thehigh rate of labour turnover and thereby improve the quality of the work;(c) The balance of expenditure between maintainingoffices overseas and advertising is under review;(d) The geographical pattern of overseas offices is being examined;(e) An inquiry into the printing costs of some of theAssociation^ publications is in hand;(f) An effort is being made to find a way of financing and publishing a more satisfactory guide to British hotels on thelines of the Michelin guide to hotels in Prance and othercountries .kko    The Chairman has further assured us -that the BoT.H.A.wills-(a) Expand its publicity in appropriate areas overseas,(b) Encourage British hotels to offer &quot;all-in&quot; holidays and urge more foreign travel agents, especially in western Europe, to advertise themc(c) Encourage the provision of more camping and caravansites and give greater publicity to their location,amenities and methods of advance booking,,(d) Follow up any information which the C-overnment maypass to it about the possibility of using accom-modation in teacher training colleges and independentboarding schools in the summer vacation.us&apos;    Sir William Mabane and Lord Geddes have told us that theyhave been encouraged by the interest shown by Ministers in theirproblems.    Their efforts to bring a fresh direction and vigourto the B.T0H0A. may not yield substantially improved results inthe short term, partly because of the nature of the problem andpartly because of the inertia or reaction of some of theinterests represented on the Board of the Association.    This is all the more reason why the Government should continue to give every encouragement, both privately and publicly, to the new&quot;management&quot;.
PART ,11SUMMARY 0? CONCLUSIONS AND recommendations.     The number of visitors to this country and our earnings from them have increased rapidly over the last few years.    but although the Government have helped a good deal,  there is constarv-pressure for more Government action (paragraphs 2-5).2.     Although the B.T.H.A.&apos;s publicity for holidays in Britainmakes an impact in those countries where it is effectivelyrepresented,  it should extend its activities,  particularly in western Europe,  and do more to encourage British hotels to offer and foreign travel agents to advertise &quot;all-in&quot; holidays in britain (paragraphs 6 and 7).3.      Overseas tours by our theatre companies,   etc.,  and ourexhibits at trade fairs provide valuable indirect publicity for britain as a tourist attraction (paragraph 8).h.      Substantial   improvements are urgently needed at most of themain tourist sea ports (paragraphs 9-11).    Facilities at london airport are better (paragraph 12) and the passenger servicecharge exacted from air passenrers is not a deterrent to tourism(paragraph 13).5.     We are unable to recommend that the segregation of foreignvisitors at the immigration control should in all cases be abolished (paragraph 15),    We can find no evidence that the labouvpermit system imposes unreasonable restrictions:    the need for itis accepted by the hotel industry (paragraph ^S).6.      The carnet/triptyque system is a deterrent to tourism andshould be suspended for a trial period of two years,   on theunderstanding that it will be re-introduced if suspension results in a significant evasion of duty and tax, which should be measured by an alternative check (paragraphs 18-21).7.      The interests of tourism would not justify a relaxation ofthe quarantine restrictions on pets (paragraph 22).8.      An increase in the amount of suitable hotel accommodation,would make a bigger contribution to our foreign exchange earnings from tourism than any other single factor.    An appropriate formof tax relief should be given to encourage the building and extension of hotels.    Exchequer loans at the ruling rate ofinterest would stimulate hotel development (paragraphs 23-26).9.      If the consultations which the Scottish Tourist Board are about to undertake show that the tourist industry in Scotlandsubstantially supports the proposal for a Tourist (Scotland) Fund,the possibility of implementing this, proposal by legislation shouldbe further explored (paragraphs 27 and 28).10.    Young tourists need more cheap accommodation (paragraph 2.9).The Government should both try to persuade the universitvauthorities to agree that a hostel among those tobebuilt within theuniversity building programme should be reserved for use by youngforeign tourists in the summer vacation (paragraph 30) and consult those concerned about the similar use of accommodation inteacher training colleges and independent boarding schools(paragraph 31),
11.    The B.T.H.A.  should encourage private enterprise to developcaravan and camping sites (paragraph 33).12,    The report by officials on the extension of the holidayseason has been considered by the Home Affairs Committee.    It Isclear that if congestion can be reduced at the peak of the holiday season it will be easier for the foreign tourist to find the accommodation he wants (paragraph 3h),13.    London needs better facilities for international conferencesThe report on this by officials in 1955 should be brought up-to-date and re-considered (paragraphs 35 and 36).Ih.    The development of tourist attractions is mainly a matter for private enterprise;    but the. flood-lighting and presentation of historic buildings and ancient monuments should be developed(paragraph 38) and the possibilities of improving touristfacilities in the National Parks should be examined (paragraph 3915.    The B.T.H.A.  is the Governments chosen instrument forstimulating tourism.    Under new leadership it is trying toincrease its income from local authorities and to improve itsservices and publicity,  and the Government should continue to givit every encouragement (paragraphs /4O-I45).April, 1961
