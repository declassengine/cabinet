Printed for the Cabinet. June 1961C. (61) 8115th June, 1961 Copy No.   56CABINETCARNET / TRIPTYQUEMemorandum by the Minister of transport the Chancellor has set out the case against suspensionThe Chancellor of the Exchequer has circulated a memorandum C. (61) 80 in response to the invitation of the Cabinet (C.C. (61) 26th Conclusions, Minute 7).He has consulted me on the particular question of the use of the registration andlicensing system for the purpose of replacing carnet controls. His paper sets out his considered views on the temporary suspension of the carnet / triptyque system in the interests of tourism.2. The objections, from a revenue point of view, to such a course are givenin detail. It is not possible to state the case for suspension with the same precisionbecause the position has never been tested. But the issue remains, as it always hasbeen, one of weighing the benefits of suspension against the possible loss of revenue.But the case for suspension is very strong3. There is no doubt that many foreign tourists regard the carnet as anirritation and an outmoded piece of control. This fact may well have a bearing onhis decision whether or not to visit this country. Our Embassies in Scandinaviahave raised the matter. The British Travel and Holidays Association tell us thattheir oversea offices take up the continued need for the carnet with them fromtime to time. Particularly, I understand that motorists abroad, understandingonly imperfectly how the control works, are put off by the fact that to obtain acarnet they must join a motoring club and pay all the expenses thus involved. Theydo not know, or find out, that they can obtain the inexpensive triptyque more easily. I understand, too, that tourists complain to our motoring organisations,which handle the issue of triptyques for an increasing number of motorists whoarrive without them because they are not accustomed to similar controls on theContinent.4. It is easy to understand these objections. The control is objectionable inthat it requires every tourist to submit to a procedure which assumes at the outset that he may well, or even intends to, try to avoid Customs duty and purchase tax.Even though the trouble to which this procedure puts him is only a small featureamong the many matters he must arrange and the cost is small in relation to theexpenditure which he must incur, it is an item which seems very important to him.He sees it as a Government restriction on international movement which is out ofstep with the times and which he does not meet elsewhere. More particularly, hesees no return for the sum, admittedly small, which he pays for the privilege ofobtaining a carnet/triptyque. He probably pays for much heavier items, e.g., hisChannel crossing, with a lighter heart.I am not satisfied that the financial argument is overriding5. The amounts now collected through the guarantee are small. Withoutthe actual figures it is impossible to say whether these amounts would be matched59173
by valuable foreign currency from additional tourism. But it would, perhaps, notbe unreasonable to say that the whole of the  135,000 now collected (most of it without recourse to the carnet guarantee) could be matched by a 2 per cent, increasein visitors.The profitability of a racket is very much open to question6. The fear that the abolition of the carnet would lead to the developmentof a racket in untaxed cars is difficult to assess. The paper of 21st February, 1961,DyCthe Minister of State, Board of Trade, to the Committee on Tourism developedthis point in some detail. He felt that the margin between continental and UnitedKingdom prices for many vehicles is not sufficient to make an organised racketworthwhile. The racketeer would in any case be faced with some considerableproblems. The cost of transport to this country is probably an item he could accept.But he must, if he is to operate on anything but a very small scale, find drivers forthe vehicles, possibly with companions to allay suspicion, and set up a disposalorganisation through shady dealers. At each stage between purchase abroad and disposal in this country his profits will be eaten into substantially by the people he must use. The sale price of the car must be substantially below the list price if heis going to dispose of it quickly. He must run more than the average risk ofdetection, since every vehicle must enter through a Customs control. There mustbe limits to the number of drivers who will be prepared to face Customs scrutinytime after time. Presumably the enforcement authorities are not without theirmethods in following up suspicious cases.The gains from suspension should outweigh possible losses7. There will, no doubt, be some small loss of revenue. There will, equally,be some gain in tourist traffic. It is impossible to balance the two, but on the sideof suspension of the carnet / triptyque we must take into account the intangiblebut nevertheless real benefits which would accrue. One important benefit wouldbe that this would be evidence to rebut the traditional view on the Continent ofBritish insularity. I believe this does us much harm abroad. We are continuallymoving slowly, in detailed matters of road transport, to a closer harmony with europe, for example, in the standards of construction for our vehicles and in facilitating the movement of commercial vehicles. I feel sure that we ought tosmooth the passage of the tourist, as virtually every other country in western europe has now done.E. M.Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1,14th June, 1961.
