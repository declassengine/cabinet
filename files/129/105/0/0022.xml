Minister of Pensions andNat i onal,In s ur an c eThe Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum (C. (6l) 65) forecasts that few,*   if any, of the reserve Bills listed in Category C of the Annex to his memorandum are likely to be included in the legislative programme for next session.     One of the Bills in this category is the Family allowances and National Insurance Bill.     I very much hope, for the reasons given inthe following paragraphs, that time can be found for this Bill.    As mycolleagues will know, the Committee on Future Legislation authorised meto proceed with its drafting and it was recognised in Committee, for thereasons set out in paragraph (u) of the summary of their discussion(F. L. (6l) 2nd Meeting), that there was a strong case for introducing theBill in the next session.     I would like to summarise the arguments for doing so.2.      It is virtually impossible to take a Bill altering the machinery ofNational Insurance, and making improvements in particular aspects of it,through the House except at a time when an increase in the general ratesof benefit has taken the main pressure of steam temporarily off thequestion of the general level of benefits.    National Insurance legislation is unique in that a financial resolution gives no protection againstattempts to make major increases in benefit.    Government supportershave, therefore, to be exposed to the necessity to vote down increases inpensions, etc.     I am quite sure that, if we leave this Bill to the 1962-63session, we shall be in very great difficulties.     The effect of thisApriFs increase in scales of benefit will have been forgotten;   the costof living may well have risen substantially;   and, politically, we shallhave to have in mind that we shall by then be well into the second halfof the present Parliament.3.      It may be therefore that, if the Bill is not introduced in thecoming session, it will be impracticable to enact it during the lifetime of this Parliament.     This would be a serious loss.    Not only would welose the opportunity of showing that our administration of social servicebenefits is reasonably flexible and progressive, but it would mean thata number of problems, which at the moment are relatively restricted intheir effect, would begin to attract an altogether disproportionate amountof criticism, with serious political and financial consequences.     I am
sure we should do a great deal of damage if we appeared to ignore thenecessity to put right difficulties of the type to be dealt with by the Bill.I indicate in the following paragraphs some of the more important matters involved.4.      In connection with the Bill, the Home Affairs Committee authorisedme within limits laid down to discuss with the Trades Union       * .Congress (T. U. C. ), with a view to securing their &quot;co-operation&quot;,proposals designed to meet in some measure long standing and stronglyfelt dissatisfaction by the T. U. C. with certain features of the industrial injuries scheme.     These proposals are for increased payments fromthe Industrial Injuries Fund for Workmen&apos;s Compensation &quot;old cases&quot;,for amendment of the Industrial Injuries Act, 1946, to cover a classof industrial accident now held to be excluded, and to make a, limitedextension of the scope of special hardship allowance.     I met the T. U. C.on 15th May and, although I was naturally careful to avoid any commitmentas to the timing of legislation, my indication of what might be done wasfavourably received and I have little reason to doubt that I shall be ableto come to an understanding with them provided that it   is possible to implement it quickly.     If we do not introduce such legislation next session, it can hardly fail to become known that the Government had recognised the need to legislate to remedy certain grievances with theworking of the Industrial Injuries scheme and our unwillingness to find time for the legislation would occasion strong criticism.    Moreover,on one of these matters at least (improved benefit for Workmen&apos;compensation &quot;old cases&quot;) an Opposition Private Member&apos;s Bill wouldprobably be introduced, as it has been repeatedly in the past, with more expensive proposals which it would, in the circumstances, be impossiblewholly to resist but which, whatever concessions we then made, would deprive us of all credit in the matter.5.      The National Insurance Advisory Committee have now reportedto me on the vexed question of the earning of pension increments byhusbands who remain at work over 65 in respect of wives under 60.     Theyhave, with great difficulty, produced an agreed report in favour of a compromise solution (which is acceptable to the Treasury).     This issue is sensitive politically, and the present position has only been acceptedduring the past 18 months because critics have known that the AdvisoryCommittee were considering it.     Their report will be published on 5th June.     Unless legislation can quickly give effect to the Committee&apos;srecommendations we shall be faced not only with strong criticism butalso with a demand that the Committee&apos;s compromise proposal benefitingwidows (which would ultimately cost  2 millions a year) should be rejected in favour of the full concession to all wives, which would cost 6 millions a year.     There would also in the event of delay be pressure for retrospection.6.      The Eill would contain other desirable improvements to oursocial security schemes - in particular it would allow family allowances to &quot;bridge the gap&quot; for certain handicapped children between the time they leave special schools and the age (16) when they become eligible-2-
for National Assistance.    Such a Bill would also enable us, in the lightof experience of the 1959 Act, to make one or two amendments to that very complicated piece of legislation which actual experience of its operation shows to be necessary.iT * A. * B * - C.Ministry of Pensions and national insurance,    W.
