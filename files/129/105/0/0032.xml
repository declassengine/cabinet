(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)Go(61) 8220th. J-une, 1961CABINETTOURISM:    THE.GARNET SYSTEM FOR PRIVATE aircraft memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on the question of documentation for private aircraft,which I was asked to consider in consultation with the Ministerof Aviation, I find that, the carnet system has not been generally abolished for private aircraft, as for cars, in western Europe.    Only four Western European countries have, infact, dispensed with carnets or triptycru.es for private aircraft,namely Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Western Germany.     Thefirst three have no import duty on aircraft, while in western germany the import duty ranges from nil on aircraft of over15,000 Kg., to 3o6 per cent only on those weighing no morethan 2,000 Kg.2.     As it happens, the Customs have already allowed substantialrelaxations of the carnet system in regard to private aircraft,in recognition of the fact that, in .so far as they move only between Customs airports, they can reasonably easily be kept under effective surveillance.      So long as they keep within these bounds, they have for some time needed no carnet ortriptyque, provided they have remained in the United kingdom for no longer than seven days at a time    and the Customshave recently agreed to extend this period to twenty-one&apos;days.3.      Most Continental countries have similar concessions, butItaly and Spain still insist on a carnet or triptyque in all circumstances.b-o      It seems to me, therefore, that we can already fairly claimto be as generous as most of our Western European neighbourswith import duties of any significance on aircraft.     as private fliers have access to some twenty-seven Customs airportsspread throughout the country for periods of three weeks at atime, subject only to prior notification of times of arrival ina few cases, they can already fly within easy reach of anyplace in the country they might v/ish to visit, without specialdocumentation of any kind.5.     The Minister of Aviation is concerned with the generalissue of encouraging the free movement of private and executiveaircraft, especially within Europe.      Our aircraft industry isat last recognising the potential market, here and abroad, for business aircraft, and is rapidly developing new models in this field.      It is in the national interest to support this movement, which is already being done in a variety of ways, andone in his view further practical way of doing so is to minimise the documentation required for business aircraft ontrips to and from the Continent.     For this reason the Ministerof Aviation would like the United Kingdom to set an exampleby abolishing the carnet system here, so that pressure couldbe brought to bear on other countries, at an international conference to be held in July, to follow suit.COPY&quot;NO.     ****
6.     Much as I sympathise with the cause of simplifying travelformalities,  generally,  as well as for private aircraft inparticular ,   I consider that the relaxations already allowed&quot;by the Customs make provision for all the reasonable needs ofvisitors arriving from abroad in private aircraft.      It would admittedly be very difficult actually to dispose of a foreignregistered aircraft here without being detected, but otherbreaches of the conditions attached to.the duty exemption infavour of aircraft used here solely for personal touringpurposes,  the temporary use of such aircraft in the service ofUnited Kingdom residents,  could easily pass undetected.Therefore if visitors wish to take such aircraft to airfields,or other places where they would no longer be under Customssurveillance,  I do xiot reg;ard it as unreasonable that theyshould be expected to produce a carnet or triptyque as security for the strict observance of those conditions,,      Apart from thepure revenue risks,  any relaxation of control in this fieldmight increase somewhat the risk of private aircraft being usedto evade our security controls.      This being so,  I find itdifficult to accept the view that we should actually take the lead in accepting such risks in the hope that this would enablethe Minister of Aviation to persuade other countries to simplifytheir controls over private aircraft.7.      The view of the Minister of Aviation is that the risksentailed are theoretical rather than practical.      To test theposition,  therefore, he would like to see an experimentalabolition of our requirements of carnets for aircraft for aperiod of two years.      I accept that the risks involved in suchan experiment are significantly less serious than is the case with cars.      The Minister holds that the proposed experimentcould in addition be very closely controlled by our two departments.      I cannot accept this but agree that it couldbe more closely controlled, than is practicable with cars.8,      The Minister considers that the risk of abolition is negligible and that the advantages,  both from the touristpoint of view and from the point of view of encouraging ourlight aviation industry,  are very considerable.      I,  for mypart,  cannot accept that the risks are negligible,  or that theadvantages would be as great as he suggests.,      This being so,I do not think that it would be wise to make any substantialfurther concessions in this field on a unilateral basis..      i suggest that the whole matter should be reconsidered,  if andwhen it becomes clear that a substantial number of othercountries with duties at a significant level on aircraft are willing to dispense with, carnets for private aircraft.S.
