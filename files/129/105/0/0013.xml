TEACHERS&apos; SALARIES IN ENGLAND AND wales memorandum by the Minister of education the present negotiation in the Burnham Committee differs fromthe Scottish negotiation: -(a) In Scotland the issue is about both salaries and the dilution of the profession with non-graduate men;  feelings seem to be deeper on the latterissue.In England the issue is only about salaries, but there are two rivalclaims, one official sponsored by the National Union of Teachers (N. U. T. )the other unofficial sponsored by the National Association of Schoolmasters(N. A. S. ).   This rivalry makes the N. U. T. more uncompromising on the basic scale than they might otherwise be.(b) In Scotland the separate scales for graduates and non-graduateshave enabled the Secretary of State to divide the teachers&apos; opposition tohis proposals.   In England the salary structure is built upon the singlebasic scale and the large number of non-graduate men teachers reinforcesthe importance attached to this.(c) The Secretary of State has the power to modify the joint recommenda-tions of the Local Authorities ..and the teachers;I can only accept or reject outright a recommendation from Eurnhamand therefore can only use behind-the-scenes pressure to get the Authoritiesto be sensible on the total increase in salaries and on the emphasis ondifferentials.(d) In Scotland the current salary award was due to run on to March, 1963;the current Burnham settlement was due to end a year earlier.2.   The English and Welsh teachers put forward in Eurnham a claim fora basic scale from  700 to  1, 300 over ten years involving a rise of about36 per cent on the total salary bill.   (The N. A.S. claim is for  800 to 1,500).3.   The English and Welsh Authorities&apos; first offer was an increase fromthe existing scale of  520 to  1,000 to  550 to  1,100, costing 10 per cent.The Teachers rejected this.   The Authorities were given a hint that theycould go to round 13 per cent and this limit was made plain by the offer ofthe Secretary of State.On 8th May the Authorities made their second offer of  575 to 1,150 over 15 years costing 13^ per cent in total.   The increase in thedifferentials was not as great as I think necessary..-1-C. (61) 63 copy NO.16th May, 1961C cabinet
4.   The teachers rejected the Authorities1 second offer which theycompared unfavourably with the Police settlement, particularly at minimum.Instead of breaking off the negotiation as would/have been wise, theAuthorities then asked the teachers what they would take.The teachers madea counter-proposal of  650 to  1,250, roughly a21 per cent increase.The Authorities replied that this was too high but they would go away and see how far they could go to bridge the gap.5. We know the Authorities have in mind to make on 30th May a thirdoffer of  600 to  1, 200 over 15 or 16 years costing about 17 to 18 per cent.They think the teachers would accept this..6.   It is possible that the Association of Municipal Corporations and partof the County Councils Association would be ready to offer less than18 per cent, but they are all tempted to put the responsibility on theGovernment (as the Scots have done) of rejecting a settlement which the teachers have accepted.   The view of the Association of Education Committeesis that the English Authorities cannot be seen to do less for the teachersthan the Scottish Authorities if widespread strikes and dissatisfactionare not to result.   They are afraid that if they stand firm in Burnham, theGovernment would in fact give way to strike pressure.7.   If the Government now rejected, for the first time, an agreedrecommendation of the Eurnham Committee, following what we have given tothe Police and the Civil Service, we should arouse the greatest indignationthroughout the education service.   Public opinion would be impressed thatthe Local Authorities, who must find a good part of the money, had supported the teachers against the Government.   We should lose much ofthe goodwill we have built up for our education policies.C.   I must therefore take soundings to see whether there are any prospects of the Authorities taking a more realistic view and of their making an offer of well below 18 per cent.The Authorities could hardly be persuaded to agree to put forward a less generous scale than  575 to  1,170, since this is only  20 better(at the maximum) than the offer which they have undertaken to improve.9.   I could point out that the basic scale applies to two-year trainedteachers, and since from now on all new entrants will be three-yeartrained, the new scale for entry would be one of  605 to  1,200, since they would start plus one increment.   If this scale were for 15 or 16 years the Authorities could offer for a total of 14 per cent to 14per cent:(a) Some larger increments after the first four years which are essential to help the young married schoolmaster.(b) Differentials that were a real bonus to those holding top posts.It will be our aim to hold off the operation of the Eurnham settlement until 1st January, and to extend it for three years.-2-
10. I feel sure that the Authorities will insist on making a better offerthan that which they have withdrawn.   There are two possibilities:(a) They may insist on a higher offer than the Government could accept.   In that event they are likely to go for what the teachers would accept and leave us with the responsibility of rejecting the joint recommenda-tion of both sides of the Burnham Committee.(b) I might be able to persuade the Authorities to make their offer onewhich the Government could accept.   Assuming that this would be of theorder of a 14-14^ per cent increase I am almost certain that the teacherswould reject it and we should be faced with a breakdown in the Durnhammachinery.   But we should then be in a better position since the authorities would be on our side.11.   I shall be able to report the latest developments to the Cabinet onICth May.D. E.Ministry of Education, W. 1.15th May, 1961-3-
