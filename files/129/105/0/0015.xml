Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1961The circulation of this paper mas been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of............................................................C. (61) 65 Copy No.    g fj24th May, 1961CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1961-62Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Future Legislation Committee have prepared, in consultation with all ministers concerned, a draft programme of legislation for next Session.2. This must, without any question, be less onerous than the programme forthe present and recent Sessions. The Committee have adopted that as the guiding principle in classifying the Bills put before them into the following categories:A.l. Essential Bills, which depend on some inescapable time-table;A.2. Contingent Bills, the need for which depends on some factor atpresent unknown;B. Programme Bills;C. Reserve Bills;P. Bills for handing to Private Members;D. Other Bills, for which time cannot be found.The proposed classification is set out in the Annex to this memorandum.3. The Bills in List B constitute a somewhat workaday programme. But weare already committed in one way or another to all of them. We cannot add totheir number without once more overloading ourselves and our supporters andas I say below we may have to eliminate some. The probability that we shall haveto re-introduce more than one Bill uncompleted in this Session gives ground forthinking that the programme for next Session is already too heavy. It includessome of the main elements agreed by the Cabinet in the forward look approvedon 23rd June, 1960. Before we decide on the main programme Bills in the lightof the spill-over we should firmly reserve the right to prune this list further. OtherBills contemplated for 1961-62 will not now be ready in time Compensation forCrimes of Violence and, probably, London Government.4. The programme for next Session needs to be looked at in conjunctionwith that for 1962-63, possibly the last full Session of the Parliament. For thatwe may have, in addition to the two Bills just mentioned, Consumer Protection,Trustee Savings Banks, Inland Waterways, Larceny, Probation, Police, Aliens,Television and possibly Sunday Observance and House of Lords Reform.5. We can hope to find time next Session for few, if any, of the &quot; reserve &quot;Bills in List C and we cannot hope for any of those in List D. On thatunderstanding, the Cabinet are invited to examine and decide upon the classification of Bills proposed in the Annex.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.1,18th May, 1961.59038
