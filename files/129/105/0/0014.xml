THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1961C. (61) 64 Copy No. 5616th May, 1961CABINETINDUSTRIAL relations memorandum by the Minister of labour at the Cabinet meeting on 4th May I undertook to circulate a memorandumon current problems of industrial relations.  (C.C. (61.) 26th Conclusions, Minute 6.)The Present State of Industrial Relations2. [a) By comparison with post-war averages, 1960 was a bad year for strikes,in terms of stoppages and workers involved, though in time lost it was better thanthe three previous years. (Annex A illustrates these points.)(b) There was no major official strike in 1960, such as the printing strike in1959 (alone responsible for some 3\ million days lost), the London &apos;bus strike of1958 (1,600,000 days) or the engineering, shipbuilding and &apos;bus strikes of 1957(totalling 6,920,000 days).(c) A very high proportion of the strikes were unofficial.(d) 1,817,000 working days, or 60 per cent, of the time lost in the whole ofindustry, was lost in four industries (coalmining, shipbuilding and repairing, motormanufacturing and docks) which comprise only 7-2 per cent, of the total working population. These four industries are normally the worst offenders, and the motor industry had its worst year ever, with half a million working days lost, i.e., 16-6 percent, of the total time lost with only 1 - 9 per cent, of the working population.The Scope for Direct Government Action3. The traditional role of the Ministry of Labour is that of conciliator indisputes. There is little scope for open intervention in an unofficial dispute, though we may be more active behind the scenes than is commonly realised. Even inofficial disputes on wages conciliation may encourage settlements on the basis ofundesirable wage increases. We cannot look, therefore, to traditional conciliationmethods for a substantial improvement in industrial relations.4. Legislation against strikes is not a practical proposition. I attach Annex Bcommenting on the various suggestions that have been made. It is worth recallingthat 1944, when strikes were for practical purposes illegal, had a particularly highstrike record.Management5. The blame for strike-proneness in any industry or a firm does not rest onlyon the workers, or even on the professional agitator. Some undertakings even inthe strike-prone industries are relatively free from trouble. The managements ofthese undertakings have adopted labour policies of the kind that have producedthe good industrial relations of firms like the Imperial Chemicals Industries Limited.By contrast the management techniques of the shipbuilding industry are, with rareexceptions, well behind the times.   The London docks employers are only now59018
beginning to give serious thought to changes in the conditions of employment whichcould improve relations. These are outstanding examples of backwardmanagement, but unfortunately they are not unique.The Unionst, .6. While Union leaders are sometimes aggressive towards management orwlak in leadership of their members, we must recognise that it is easy to expecttoo much of them. They are elected representatives and their power of initiativeis limited by the general apathy of the mass of membership. There is often an active and watchful Left wing, ever ready to accuse the leaders of a &quot; sell out tothe bosses &quot;. Even so there is scope for improving trades union structure and administration, but this will have to come from within.The Positive Approach7. We have to seek to create better relations at all levels, especially in thestrike-prone industries. This can only come if management adopts better ways of handling labour and secures co-operation from responsible trade unions.I believe that we can take action to encourage this, though the nature of theappropriate action will differ according to the industry.8. The National Joint Advisory Council have already been considering somebasic problems of industrial relations, such as communications and joint consultation, redundancy, training of supervisors, and economical use of manpower.Both sides have shown a genuine desire to make progress, and I hope that we canlead them into discussions of more controversial issues.Approach to Individual Industries9. We have made an encouraging start with the motor industry. These talksbrought out the question whether the unions are prepared to exercise authority over the unofficial strikers; and the action in this direction taken in the Pressed Steelstrike at Swindon by the Amalgamated Engineering Union has been satisfactory.10. But the direct approach that I made to the motor industry is notnecessarily right elsewhere. In shipbuilding I believe the first step is to prod thetwo sides not merely to follow up the recommendations of the Shipbuilding advisory councils sub-Committee on Prospects, but to look beyond them. I hope it maybe possible to get the Employers&apos; Federation to work out proposals for better relations which may evoke a satisfactory reaction from the unions. With theagreement of the Ministry of Transport I am having some informal talks withrepresentatives of the two sides, to this end.11. As to the docks, we need a three-pronged attack by employers, unions and Dock Labour Boards. In London especially the employers need to rationalisetheir organisation (there are some 500-600 separate employers in the Port, someof them very small indeed), to plan work so as to give greater continuity ofemployment, and to improve their personnel management. I have been encouraged to learn that much thought is being given to this. The unions should strengthen their organisation, raise the quality of their full-time officials and improve theircontacts with the rank and file, and Mr. Frank Cousins has assured me that he isgiving personal and urgent attention to this. The London Dock Labour Board haslittle scope for initiative on its own, being controlled by the two sides of theindustry, but given a chance by its masters could do more to introduce civilisedmethods into the hiring and deployment of labour; I am in informal touch withall three parties on these points.12. In coalmining all strikes are unofficial, and usually short. Now that thenew Chairman of the Board has had time to look around him, he might be asked what conclusions he has reached on this special problem; should the Minister of power so desire I should be very glad to be associated in such an approach.The Electrical Trades Union Case13. I am examining the implications of this case and I shall circulate amemorandum when judgment has been given. At present we do not know whatthe High Court can or may do to deal with abuses. Until we know this we cannot
usefully consider whether or not any changes in the law are needed. legislation to limit the freedom of trade union members to conduct their own affairs inaccordance with their own rules would certainly be resented by trade unionistsgenerally. It would prejudice our efforts to get from the trade unions theco-operation we need to pursue the policies outlined above and to make real progress in improving industrial relations. My present inclination therefore is against legislation and in favour of using the Electrical Trades Union case to attack the Communist infiltration in the unions and to press for it to be tackled bydemocratic action within them.Conclusion14. I do not see any simple solution for the problem of industrial relations.Our task must be to work slowly and laboriously on the industries with the worstrecord in order to bring them up to the level of the best. If we are to succeedwe must carry with us the responsible elements in the trades unions. They may at times be pushed on one side by the vocal and dissident minority, but the movementas a whole is undoubtedly a stabilising influence in the country. Our object should always be to strengthen and stimulate the responsible elements, so that theyare able to deal in their own way with those who are out to damage not only the economy but the unions themselves.J.

ANNEX note on Suggestions for Legislation to Prevent StrikesA. Legislation making Unofficial Strikes Illegal(i) There would still be unofficial strikes. Wartime experience, whenpractically all strikes were illegal, shows this. (1944 was one of the worst years for strikes of the past two decades.)(ii) There would be very great practical difficulties in prosecuting the largenumbers of people who would be involved. This also was proved during the war.(iii) There would be great difficulty in defining unofficial strikes some strikesbegin as unofficial and later become official.(iv) Legislation would be strongly opposed by the trade unions.(v) It would therefore do serious damage to industrial relations generally.(vi) It would be based on the implicit assumption that in all unofficial strikesthe workers are always entirely in the wrong and the employers entirely in theright. In fact, strikes both official and unofficial are often caused by provocativeactions or attitudes on the part of the employer.A modified form of this suggestion is to amend existing trade union law toremove some of the protection given to workers under the Trade Union Act, 1906,if the strike is unofficial. Similar practical difficulties about definition and enforcement of penalties would arise.B. Legislation to make Strikes Illegal unless Members of the Union concerned have agreed to the Strike by a Secret Ballot(i) This would make unofficial strikes illegal (see A).(ii) The proposal is based on the assumption that the rank and file workers are less militant than their leaders. This is not generally true. It assumes thatthe extremist agitators in the rank and file would have less influence. This isdoubtful.(iii) There would be a danger that some trade union leaders might take a ballot at an early stage in the proceedings or negotiation as a matter of tactics, and use a strike threat as a form of blackmail to get more out of employers.(iv) Some 40 unions have arrangements in their rules for a vote to be taken before a strike is called. There is nothing in the experience of these unions tosuggest that legislation to make such rules universal would reduce the number of strikes. The National Union of Mine Workers, for example, have very stringentrules. As a result, there is practically never an official strike in coal-mining, butlast year the number of unofficial strikes amounted to some 65 per cent, of thetotal number of stoppages in this country.(v) Australia, New Zealand and certain provinces of Canada have provision in their systems of conciliation for compulsory pre-strike ballots, but all thesecountries have considerably worse records of time lost through strikes than theUnited Kingdom.C. Legislation to make Strikes Illegal with Provision for Compulsory Arbitration(i) Compulsory arbitration in the real sense (i.e., arbitration enforced by lawin the case of all disputes not settled by negotiation) involves the withdrawal ofthe right to strike. It is not compatible with generally accepted ideas of freenegotiation and free contract.(ii) Experience during and after the war when there was &quot; compulsory arbitration &quot; (i.e., one party to a dispute could require the other to go to arbitration)makes it clear that this would not prevent strikes (see A).D. Legislation to apply a &quot; Cooling-off &quot; period before a Strike can be calledLegislation has been suggested to require that strikes should be preceded byan independent inquiry and that a specified period should elapse between thepublication of the report of the inquiry and the calling of the strike. The assumptionbehind this suggestion is that this interval would act as a &quot; cooling-off&quot; period.Experience in the United States which has provision under the Taft Hartley Actfor such a &quot; cooling-off &quot; period before strike action, suggests that it would tendto be a &quot; hotting-up &quot; period during which both sides take up rigid positions which only serve to make later negotiations more difficult. The strike record of theUnited States is no recommendation for it. In 1959 for instance seven times as many working days per employee were lost as in the United Kingdom. There arealso, as with the other suggestions, great difficulties in the way of enforcement.May, 1961.
