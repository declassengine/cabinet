(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CCFY NO.  OlffCABINETFACILITIES FOR THE GERMAN forces memorandum by the Minister of defence on 16th February the Cabinet approved proposals which I had put before them to offer certain defence facilities in the United kingdom for the Federal German Forces (C. C.(6l)7th Conclusions, Minute 6)on the understanding that this offer did not finally commit the Govern-ment.2. Subsequent discussions with German representatives haveshown that the Germans are extremely short of ranges at which theirnewly formed armoured regiments can carry out tank firing training,which all tank units must do.    German representatives have visited theArmy range at castle martin and it is clear that the facilities there are suitable for their needs.     There are a number of administrative problems for the Germans, in view of the need to transport men and tanks from Germany to Wales, but there is little doubt that the Germanscan overcome them if they are prepared to incur the expense.    we suggested to them that, in view of the administrative problems, it wouldbe sensible to start with a pilot scheme of one regiment, to befollowed by other regiments if the arrangements prove satisfactory.3. Herr Strauss, the Federal German Minister of Defence,told me, at my recent meeting with him, that they would like to sendan armoured regiment to castle martin in September, and I think Ishould now seek my colleagues&apos; approval to the proposed arrangements.4. Some opposition to this proposal has been expressed in theHouse and outside, mainly by certain Labour Members and TradeUnion representatives.     I do not think that these views are shared bythe majority of people in the country and, although there may be somedemonstrations if German units visit castle martin, I doubt whetherthey will be serious.     There is no evidence that the people who live inCastlemartin are opposed to German troops using the range.    Onthe contrary there is some reason to hope that the money they will bring will help to maintain employment in the winter months.5. It is clear that the Germans have an urgent need to useCastlemartin and I see no reason why we should not make the rangeavailable to them at times when it is not in use by British Army unitsor the Territorial Army.     We may, however, have to impose certainrestrictions on the amount and type of training so as to prevent-1-SiCHETC.(61) 769th June, 1961

German representatives have also inspected the variousstorage facilities which we offered to them and we have now beeninformed that they consider these facilities to be suitable for their needs and that they would like to arrange further discussions in orderto conclude a definite agreement.7. Discussions about the use of naval training facilities in the cape Wrath area are still proceeding.     We have offered the use ofthis in the autumn but have not yet heard whether the Germans wish totake advantage of it.8. No definite requirements for repair of ships or aircraft have yet been stated.9. Before any German units can visit this country for training,it will be necessary to apply the Visiting Forces Act, 1952, to Germany,The Cabinet agreed on 14th March (C. C. (6l) 12th Conclusions, Minute 6)that the necessary Orders should be prepared and introduced inParliament before the beginning of the next session.    The preparationof the Orders is in hand, and it is intended that they should be laidand debated in July.10. I suggest that I should now inform Herr Strauss that:-(a) we agree in principle to an armoured regimentvisiting castle martin in September on a trialbasis if they want to come, and that we shallbe willing, if the trial is successful, to acceptadditional regiments as may be mutually agreed;(b) we agree in principle to make available the storage facilities which the German authoritieshave requested.It will be necessary to inform the House of Commons about these decisions, probably by means of an arranged Question.11. I invite the Cabinet to approve these proposals.H. W,Ministry of Defence, S. W, 1.9th June, 1961.
