Printed for the Cabinet:  June 1961C. (61) 78 Copy No.   539th June, 1961CABINETMACHINERY FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF TEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Minister of education in connexion with the current negotiations on teachers&apos; salaries, I have considered in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaryof State for Scotland, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government what steps should be taken to provide for more effectiveGovernment participation in these settlements.The Present Position2. Under Section 89 of the Education Act, 1944, the Minister of education has to ensure that there are committees approved by him representing localeducation authorities and teachers respectively whose duty it is to submit to himsuch scales off salary as they consider suitable. They may do this whenever theythink fit or whenever required by him. Any scales recommended by the Committeeonly come into force when approved by the Minister. He has no power to amend the proposals submitted to him. In Sootland, under the 1946 Act, the Secretaryof State prescribes teachers&apos; remuneration in regulations but is required to consult with a council, representing education authorities and teachers, and to have regardto any recommendations they make. He has, therefore, power to decide whether to accept such recommendations or to modify them.The Interests Involved3. The interest of the Minister of Education in these salary settlements istwofold:(i) On grounds of educational policy he may wish to influence the shape and structure of teachers&apos; salaries, e.g., the relative pay of graduateand non-graduate teachers or of those carrying posts of special responsibility.(ii) In the light of the size of the total salary bill, the fact that over 50 percent, of this has to be met through general grant, and the inter ^relation of teachers&apos; with other public servants&apos; pay the Government may need to control any revision of teachers&apos; salaries.4. The local education authorities&apos; interest is, as the employers off the teachersresponsible for running the education service, finding a very substantial proportionof the money and very jealous of their independent status. The teachers&apos; attitude is conditioned by their wish to negotiate direct with the power that has the finalsay. There is thus a school of thought which presses for the Government to paythe whole of teachers&apos; salaries&apos; cost and therefore for negotiations to take placedirect with the Government, With that qualification the teachers resist Governmentinterference with the negotiating machinery as stoutly as do the local educationauthorities.59155
The Working of the Present Arrangements5. The present arrangements are thus an uneasy combination of freenegotiations between the employers (the local education authorities) and the teachers and final approval by the Minister. They have none the less certain advantages.Absence of any possibility of salary change unless agreement is reached is undoubtedly a powerful pressure on the teachers to agree and there is a sense ofresponsibility on both sides. The authorities take the first and main brunt ofthe negotiations; they are accustomed to wage a stiff battle in difficult arid expertnegotiations, and the threats of strike action are directed against them rather tharithe Government. It would be wrong too to ignore the very considerable influenceexercised by means of contacts between officials in the course of day-to-day administration. In the period preceding the Burnham negotiations these contactsare important but very delicate owing to the sensitiveness of both sides to any suggestion of interference with free negotiation. They are none the less reasonablyeffective up to the point of the crunch of negotiations when the local educationauthorities are subject to the heavy pressure of the big battalions of the NationalUnion of Teachers and have the final say (subject to the Ministers reserve powers)at the margin of negotiations. These arrangements, therefore, make a situationpossible (as indeed they have on this occasion) where the only way of exercisinga decisive Government control is to refuse to approve an agreement resultingfrom prolonged negotiations when the whole matter has become a major politicalissue.6. This situation is one which in my view cannot be allowed to continue.I recognise that it is only one part of the whole problem of pay settlements inthe public sector and that in taking any action Which would diminish the powersand independence of the local authorities at a time when we have declared our intention to increase both we shall stir up strong and vigorous opposition. indeed the whole trend of thought in the local authority world is towards a diminutionrather than an increase of Government control in respect of teachers&apos; salaries.Nevertheless the amount of money involved, the inevitable increase iri the futureof the size of the teaching profession arid its importance in the community as theeducation service itself develops, make it essential that the Government should enter more directly into the decisions On teachers&apos; salaries even though we mightthereby be exposed to strong pressures at an earlier stage than we are now.7. Two separate requirements must be met. First the Ministers views, bothon the educational aspects of salary policy and on the order of magnitude of thebill which could be contemplated, must be made known to and taken intoconsideration by both parties at an early stage of the negotiations, and second,the Minister should be in a position to ensure that his essential requirements underthese heads are met. The Secretary of State for Scotland possesses sufficientpowers for the latter purpose, but he is, I understand, considering whether recognisedarrangements could be made for placing his views before the National joint council in the course of negotiations. The situation in Scotland is complicated by the procedure for &quot; arbitration &quot; between the two sides of the Council if theycannot otherwise reach agreement on the recommendation to the Secretary ofState. He is not a party to this process and his power to accept or modify therecommendation is unaffected.8. It is riot easy to decide the precise form which amended machinery shouldtake. There is much to be said for an amendment of the Education Act to give me powers, similar to those of the Secretary Of State, to amend recommendationsreached by the Burriham Committee and I think that we should be prepared to contemplate legislation of this nature. I show in the Annex one possible way in which the 1944 Act might be amended to give me equivalent powers. I must point out however that any legislation on these lines would be bound to lead to demands that teachers should, like most other public servants, have the benefitof arbitration and there would be other contentious points. It would certainly be necessary to have discussions with representatives of the local educationauthorities and the teachers before reaching final decisions ori the best method tobe adopted., 9. I propose to discuss further with the Secretary of State how the Englisharid Scottish negotiations might best be timed in future so as to avoid leap-frogging.
10.  I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; approval:(i) To my informing the local education authorities and the teachers at theappropriate time in relation to the current Burnham settlement that theGovernment have decided that there must be changes in the present arrangements which will enable the Governments views to be effectivelyand positively taken into account in the settlement of teachers&apos; salaries,and that they are prepared, if necessary, to bring in legislation for thatpurpose.(ii) To my having discussions with the two sides to work out the most suitableproposals.D. E.Ministry of Education, W. 1,9th June, 1961.annex proposed Amendment to Section 89 of Education Act, 1944(New words underlined)&quot; The Minister shall secure that for the purpose of considering the remuneration of teachers there shall be one or more committees approved by himconsisting of persons appointed by bodies representing local education authoritiesand teachers respectively and it shall be the duty of any such committee to submit to the Minister, whenever they think fit or whenever they may be required by himto do so, such scales of remuneration for teachers as they consider suitable: and theMinister may approve any scale of remuneration so submitted after making such modifications therein, if any, as appear to him desirable; and he may then by ordermake provision for the purpose of securing that the remuneration paid by LocalEducation Authorities to teachers is in accordance with any scale of remunerationso approved or approved with modifications.&quot;
