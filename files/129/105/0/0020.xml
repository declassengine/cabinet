C. (61) 7029th May, 1961CABINETADEN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for air the Colonial Secretary in hi3 paper (C. (6l) 63) recommends thatwe should take active steps to bring about a between AdenColony and the neighbouring Federation.     With some hesitation, but inview of the long connexion between the Royal Air Force and Aden, i venture to submit a somewhat different view.2.      Both the moderate leaders in the Colony and the Rulers in. theFederation are favourable to the general idea of a merger.     If both parties could agree among themselves to the terms of the merger weshould have little choice of action.    But, as the Colonial Secretaryexplains, they have rather different conceptions of what form the mergershould take.     The Rulers would like to annex Aden Colony to theSultanate of Lahej to which it historically belongs.     The Colony leaderscontemplate entering the Federation as a leading constituent member.Given these differences of approach it seems possible, to say the least,that without active help and encouragement from the British side the rulers and the Colony leaders would fail to reach agreement on the termsof the merger.     The decision whether a merger should or shoxxld not take place may thus prove to be very largely in our hands.3.      In these circumstances should we exercise our influence infavour of the merger or against it?4.      From the British point of view the main advantage of a mergerwould be that it would bring the nationalist and potentially turbulentColony under the control of the Federation whose present Rulers areloyal to the British connection.     In the event of trouble in the Colonythey would then suppress the trouble makers instead of our having to doso.5.      The main disadvantage of a merger would be that the new Statecombining both the Colony and the Federation would sooner or later - andprobably sooner - demand independence.     V/e could scarcely resistsuch a demand, and our defence facilities would then have to restlargely and perhaps entirely, on Treaty rights.     It is difficult to judgehow much reliance we could place upon a Treaty.     But the influence ofthe extremists in the Colony is likely to spread to the Federation;  andit must be remembered that we need our bases in Aden mainly for operations against other Arab States.COPY NO.    &amp;X
6.      The question whether to encourage or discourage a merger raisesa more general aspect of defence policy.     If we are to retain any military position overseas, we shall have to keep a minimum number of effective bases (as distinct from staging posts) under our undisputedcontrol for an indefinite period ahead.    Any list of such bases must, i submit, include Aden Colony,     It will, after Kenya becomes independent,be our only major base on the western seaboard of the Indian Ocean.7.      If we bring about a merger we shall no doubt benefit for a time from the goodwill of the Rulers, but we shall have started a process which will lead inevitably to the independence of the new South ArabianState and to the restriction, at the very least, of our defence facilities,8,      If on the other hand we avoid a merger we should be able tomaintain our title to Aden Colony for a very long time ahead.     Thesmall size and population of the Colony make it impracticable for it toaspire to independence on its own.     We should no doubt have sometrouble with nationalist elements in the Colony and may have to resort to direct rule for a time.     But the best advice suggests that the extremists could not present us with any serious or sustained internal security problem.9.      My conclusions therefore are:-(a) We should not resist a merger if the Colonymoderates and.the Rulers can agree its termsbetween them.(b) We should do nothing to encourage the merger,and should leave it to the Rulers to decide whether and how to open negotiations with theColony leaders.10.     It would, of course, be very important to manage this withoutalienating the Rulers.     This would not be easy, since they would resent any constitutional advance in the Colony outside the context of a merger.At the same time they have a strong underlying community of interestwith us and if negotiations among themselves for a merger broke down their resentment would perhaps be directed against the Colony leadersrather than against ourselves.11.     It is, of course, true that if a merger took place without us,we should have deprived ourselves of the opportunity of influencing thekind of constitution which would result.    At the same time it seems tome that we should be in a stronger position to lay down our terms on defence and to resist exorbitant demands for subsidy if the Rulers andColony politicians have to come to us and seek our agreement ratherthan if we have to carry proposals to them and urge them to accept.J. A.Air Ministry, S.W. 1.2.6th May, 1961.-2-
