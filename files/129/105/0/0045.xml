Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1961C. (61)95 Copy No.     6011th July, 1961CABINETTRADE UNION ELECTIONSMemorandum by the Minister of LabourBefore the High Court judgment in the action against officials of the electrical trades Union the union had admitted irregularities in the conduct of the election of the general secretary. The primary effect of the judgment, from which there may,of course, be an appeal, has been to focus attention on the malpractices of certainindividuals against whom damages and costs were awarded. An appeal would raise again the question of the culpability of the individual defendants but not thefact that there have been admitted irregularities in the conduct of the election.2. The judgment showed that the Court can deal effectively with abuses and provide appropriate remedies. To this extent it could be argued that the outcomejustifies leaving matters as they are. But it required great determination on thepart of the plaintiffs to bring the case and the procedure was costly and slow. this might discourage other similar actions, and malpractices might therefore continue without being exposed. This is the problem we have to consider.3. Our aim must be to strengthen the rights of members to ensure that unionaffairs are run in accordance with the rules. It would accord with our acceptanceof the right of trade unions to run their own affairs if we could rely on them to put their own house in order; and International Labour Convention No. 87 (Freedomof Association and Protection of Right to Organise), which has been ratified by theUnited Kingdom, also points in that direction. (Article 2 of the InternationalLabour Convention No. 87 provides: &quot; Workers and employers . . . shall havethe right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned,to join organisations of their own choosing . . .&quot;. Article 3 provides:&quot; (1) Workers&apos; and employers&apos; associations shall have the right to draw up their constitution and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organisetheir administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. (2) Thepublic authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this rightor impede the lawful exercise thereof &quot;.) If the Trades Union Congress could getall unions to adopt model rules for the conduct of elections, including the running of elections by an independent body (as some are at present) malpractices couldbe prevented.4. But if all the trade unions are not prepared to take action on these lines and it is unlikely that the Trades Union Congress could persuade them all to doso we must recognise that the Trades Union Congress itself is not able to exposemalpractices or to give redress against them.5. If therefore the unions will not act themselves, we should, in my view,deal with the matter by legislation. We could give the Registrar of friendly societies powers to deal with infringements of election rules like those he hasalready in respect of political funds. Under the Trade Union Act, 1913, the registrar must approve rules governing the political fund, can hear complaints,and if he finds that a breach has been committed he may then &quot; make such order for the remedying of the breach as he thinks just in the circumstances&quot;. Theorder is enforceable in the County Court. (The powers of the Registrar overtrade unions are set out in the Annex.)59284b
6. I would give the Registrar the same powers to hear complaints aboutbreaches of election rules and to make orders remedying the breaches. I would still leave a High Court action as an alternative remedy. But I very much doubt whether we should empower the Registrar to approve election rules, since thiswould be held seriously to infringe the independence of the unions, and to be contrary to International Labour Convention No. 87.7. If my colleagues agree I shall in the first instance discuss the problem withthe Trades Union Congress. I should also talk with the British Employers&apos;Confederation, since legally employers&apos; organisations are trade unions. I shouldnot rule out the possibility that the trade unions themselves might take effective action on the lines indicated in paragraph 3 above. I should make it plain,however, that we cannot leave the matter as it is, and if the trade unions cannotact in this way the Government must then legislate on the lines indicated inparagraphs 5 and 6. I shall talk with Mr. Woodcock, General Secretary of theTrades Union Congress, informally in the next few days, but I cannot conceivablyget a firm answer from the Trades Union Congress before the next meeting of theGeneral Council on 26th July. I should, however, make it clear to the TradesUnion Congress that some announcement of the Governments intention must bemade before the summer recess.8. There is a Motion on the Order Paper signed by 68 Members and thereare potentially many more who support it. If the action I am taking is explained to them I think they would be prepared to wait until we know what decision, ifany, the Trades Union Congress take on 26th July. But they will certainly expecta definite statement from the Government before the summer recess.Ministry of Labour, S.W. 1,10th July, 1961.
SECRETANNEXPOWERS OF THE REGISTRAR OF FRIENDLY SOCIETIES*OVER.TRADE UNIONS1. Registration of trade unions is voluntary. Registrationcarries some privileges and obligations, but the legal status of tradeunion can be enjoyed without it. Registered employees&apos; unionscomprise about 90 per cent, of trade union membership, but even alarge union can Operate satisfactorily without being registered, e.g.,The Union of Post Office Workers. The Registrar has no powers ofcontrol over unregistered unions except in regard to their politicalfunds (paragraphs 12-16 below).Registration of Rules2. Registered unions must send their rules and any alterations T.U. Act, 1871,for registration. The Act says merely that the rules must &quot; contain s. 14 and 1stprovisions in respect of &quot; certain basic matters, which are in short   schedule.name and meeting place; objects, purposes for which fundsmay be applied, conditions of any assured benefits, and anyfines or forfeitures; manner of altering rules; appointment and removal of general officers; investment of funds andperiodical audit;  inspection of the books and names ofTTJ Act 1876members of the union by persons &quot; having an interest in &quot; s&apos; i4the funds; and manner of dissolution.3.   On an application to register rules or alterations, if theTU At 1871Registrar is satisfied that the rules make provision for these matters s&apos; 13 (2).&apos;he is bound to register them. The kind of provision made e.g., the f.u, Reg., 1876,procedure for appointing or removing officers rests entirely with the r. 6.union.4. The form of application to register rules includes a sworndeclaration by an officer of the union to the effect that in making therules or alterations the union&apos;s rules have been duly complied with.Occasionally the application is challenged by members who say thatthe rules have not been properly passed. The Registrar cannot decidethis issue. If the objection seems bona fide, his practice (extra-statutory) has been to offer to defer registration for a short period toenable the objectors to start proceedings in the Courts. If they take up the offer he defers registration pendente lite.Annual Returns5.  A registered union must send the Registrar an annual return, T.U. Act, 1871,comprising accounts and a balance sheet, in a form prescribed by him s. 16.(the form appears in the Appendix to his Report on Trade Unions for1959). The return must be audited. Most of the large unions employprofessional auditors, but no qualifications are required by law.Powers of Prosecution6. The Registrar can prosecute in the Magistrates Courts forany offence under the Trade Union Acts. The principal offences are(a) Failing to send the annual return, or to supply copies of the T.U. Act, 1871,rules or annual return.   Maximum penalty  5.   (A ss. 16, 14(2),registered union is bound to supply on demand by anyperson a copy of its rules for a charge not exceeding Is. Od.,and on demand by a member or &quot; depositor &quot; a free copyof its annual return.)* In the Trade Union Acts &quot; the Registrar&quot; means for England and Wales,the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies, and for Scotland, the Assistant Registrarfor Scotland (T.U. Act, 1913, s. 7).59284
T.U. Act, 1871, (b) Wilful falsification of the annual return or rules. Maximums- 16- penalty  50.s. 18. (c) Issuing false copies of rules.   Misdemeanour, no penaltyprescribed.s- 12 (d) Obtaining   possession   of   union   property   by   falserepresentation, or having the same in one&apos;s. possessionwilfully withholding or misapplying it. Maximumpenalty  20 and an order for restitution, with up to threemonths&apos; imprisonment in default.7. With regard to sub-paragraph (d) above, cases where unionproperty has apparently been misappropriated come to the registrar^ notice from time to time, usually through the annualreturn. No count has been kept of these cases, but the Registrar^practice is to ask the union to give particulars and say what action has been taken to recover the property. If the union has taken noappropriate action and is unwilling to do so, he considers proceedings under Section 12. As he has no compulsory powers of investigation,his ability to prosecute under Section 12 normally depends onco-operation by the union&apos;s head office. In the only case where he proposed to prosecute in recent years this co-operation was refused(Report for 1958 paragraphs 4-5), though it would be unsafe todraw general conclusions, from this one case.Section 12 aims at the recovery of the missing property, andcarries only a minor penalty. A summons under that Section would obviously be inappropriate by way of criminal prosecution in aserious case of fraud.Cancellation of Registry8.  The Registrar can cancel a union&apos;s registration:T.U. Act, 1876,      (a) At the request of the union.s- 8(1)- (b) If registration was obtained by fraud or mistake.(c) If the union has an unlawful purpose.(d) If it wilfully and after notice violates any provision of theTrade Union Acts.(e) If it has ceased to exist.T.U. Act, 1913, &apos;(/) If it has ceased to be a trade union as defined in Section 2(1)s. 2(2). of the Trade Union Act, 1913.9. The only cancellations in recent years have been on grounds(a), (e) and (/). The threat of cancellation would in any case have only a limited value as a deterrent to misconduct by a union.Other Powers10. The Registrar has miscellaneous.powers which are of littlerelevance in the present context, e.g.,T.U. Act, 1876, (a) His approval is required for a union&apos;s change of name,s. 11.(b) A union wishing to transfer its engagements to another union*&quot;M?scenaneous must ^et ^e consent G^ two-thirds of its members unlessProvisions) trie Registrar dispenses with this requirement.   He hasAct, 1940, s. 6. 1 power to dispense after hearing interested parties.T.U. Act, 1876, (c) He can direct transfers of certain stocks where a trustee iss. 4.     &apos;      &apos; missing or incapacitated.11. Except in relation to. the political fund, he has no power todeal with complaints by members; to interpret rules; to take action onalleged breaches of rule (unless a breach of the Act is also involved,e.g., a misapplication of funds contrary to Section 12); or to decidedisputes within the Union. And no power in any circumstances to investigate a union&apos;s affairs or to control its elections or otherconstitutional procedures.
The Political Fund12. Before a union (registered or unregistered) can spend money T.U. Act, 1913,on political objects, the furtherance of those objects must be, approved ss- 3 0-X 4 (1).by a ballot vote of the members. The ballot must be taken under rulesapproved for the purpose by the Registrar, who cannot approve themunless satisfied &quot; that every member has an equal right, and, ifreasonably possible, a fair opportunity of voting, and that the secrecy of the ballot is properly secured &quot;.13.  If the resolution is passed, the union must also adopt rules t.U. Act, 1913,approved by the Registrar providing for a separate political fund; for s. 3 (1).the right to contract out of contributing to the fund; that a contracted-out member is not to be victimised; and that contribution to the fund is not to be a condition of admission to the union.14. Model rules for the purposes of paragraphs 12 and 13 are issued by the Registrar, and these have been adopted by unions with only minor variations.15.  A member who alleges that he is aggrieved by a breach of t.u. Act, 1913,any of these rules may complain to the Registrar, who after hearing s. 3 (2).the complainant and the union may, if he thinks a breach has been committed, &quot; make such order for remedying the breach as he thinksjust in the circumstances &quot;.  The order is enforceable in the county court.16. Complaints necessitating a formal hearing and order do notaverage more than one or two in a year. On a rough estimate, some30-40 letters of complaint are received each year. Of these, some are obviously misconceived and the great majority of the rest aresatisfactorily settled by correspondence. Often the trouble has been due to muddle or misunderstanding at branch level. The unionsgenerally have shown readiness, when the Registrar informs them ofa member&apos;s political fund complaint, to investigate the complaintpromptly and if at fault to put it right.July 1961
