JHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)I C. (61) 53 COPY NO.12th April. 1961CABINETSCOTTISH TEACHERS&apos; PAY CLAIMMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i informed my colleagues orally on 28th March that teachers in glasgow have threatened to strike for a week from Monday, 8th May, unlessby 1st May I had assured them that I had abandoned suggestions for the intro-duction of non-graduate men teachers and an increase in salaries acceptable to the profession had been negotiated.    My colleagues agreed that I shouldmake no concession on either point.2, The salary issue has now acquired particular urgency becausethe Nation.-.l Joint Council for Teachers Salaries in Scotland (the Scottishcounterpart of the Burnham Committee) on 7th April reached agreement on reccomendatons to me.   These are for a general increase of 12j per centon the current salaries of all grades of teachers coupled with a reductionof all scales to 12 or 10 years.   The total cost of the recommendations v/ould be about  6. 5 millions representing an increase of 18 per cent on the3alarie3 bill.3. An increase of this magnitude is clearly unacceptable;, increases in line with what is understood to be the intention of the English localauthorities would have amounted to about  4 millions or about 12 per cent of the salaries bill.   Moreover, it is quite unjustifiable to give a general increase of 12^- per cent to all grades irrespective of the need to attractrecruits to each of these.   For example, it would be difficult to justify an increase of anything like this order for women non-graduate teachers.4. One serious aspect of the matter is that both tho English localauthorities and the English teachers, who have not yet reached agreement on the Burnham Committee, may be influenced by the belief that theagreement reached by the National Joint Cotincil in Scotland might beaccepted by the Government.   The Enrjlish local authorities are to meet on14th April to reach agreement on the offer which they will make to theEnglish teachers at the meeting of the Burnham Committee on 20th April.5. In these circumstances, I propose, subject to the agreement ofmy colleagues: -(i) that the Secretary of the English local authorities side   shouldbe informed in confidence forthwith that when they are preparing their offerit should not be assumed that the National Joint Council&apos;s recommendations will be accepted and(ii) that before the meeting of the Burnham Committee on 20th AprilI should inform the National Joint Council, that for the reasons indicated inparagraph 3 their recommendations as cannot be accepted as they stand, and thatI would intend to put alternative proposals before them for their viev/s.-1-confidential 
(These proposals would have regard to the varying needs to stimulaterecruitment of the several grades of teachers and to the total cost acceptable to the Government.)   It will be necessary to ensure that the English localauthorities and the English teachers are aware of my decision before theymeet on 20th April and it may be desirable that I should make the position clear by a statement, possibly in answer to a Question in the House on tuesday.6. I feel bound to warn my colleagues that my refusal to acceptthe agreed recommendations of the National Joint Council, an unprecedentedstep, seems bound to mean that the threatened strike in Glasgow will takeplace and that teachers in other parts of Scotland may join it.   I amconsidering whether it would be tactically wise to announce simultaneously with my decision on salaries that I propose to defer a decision on the intro-duction of non-graduate men, at least until the Robbins Committee on higher Education has reported.   I should like to leave the decision on whether or not to make such an announcement to be determined in thelight of the general situation as it develops.J.S.M.Scottish Office, S. W.l.12th April, 1961-2-confidential
