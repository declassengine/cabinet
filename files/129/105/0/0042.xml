GERMAN ASSETS IN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the President of the Board of trade  Note by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs on German assets in theUnited Kingdom was considered by the Cabinet in September 1959 (CG. (59) 51stConclusions, Minute 2). The Cabinet decided to defer a decision on the disposalof these assets. I think that the time has now come when we ought to look at thequestion again, with a view to taking a decision.background. The Distribution of German Enemy Property Act, 1949, required the proceeds of German assets in the United Kingdom to be distributed as dividendsfto certain classes of United Kingdom creditors of Germany, unless it was not practicable to distribute the sums in the hands of the Administrator. (It wouldnot, for example, be practicable to distribute a sum which by itself would yield adividend of less than Id. in the  .) By 1957 proceeds amounting to  15^ millionshad been distributed, giving a total dividend of 2s. lOJd. in the  .3. At that time it appeared that the residue of assets would not be large enoughto be worth distributing. The Distribution of Enemy Property (No. 3) Order wastherefore issued in August 1957. Under this a sum of  250,000 was assigned tothe Nazi Victims Relief Trust and further moneys accruing from German assetswere to be paid to the Exchequer.4. In the event the unexpectedly large sum of  1 -07 millions has been realised(over and above the  250,000 for the Trust). This amount is certainly sufficient tobe worth distributing to United Kingdom creditors. Over the years further assetswill fall in, mainly from interests in wills and settlements. The amount can onlybe guessed, but it is not thought likely to exceed  100,000 and could be very much less. These assets are referred to as &quot; future interests &quot;.Questions for Decision(a) Disposal of Liquid Assets5. With the agreement of my colleagues, I propose to make from the moneynow available to the German Administrator a further distribution to UnitedKingdom creditors, in accordance with the terms of the 1949 Act. The amount( 1-07 millions) will be sufficient to pay a dividend of 2 d. in the  , bringing thetotal dividend to 3s. 0^d.6. A residue of about  70,000 will then be left in the hands of the administrator. (As this represents less than ^d. in the  , it would not be practicable to include it in the distribution.) The normal course would be to pay this moneyinto the Exchequer. I propose, however, that it should be made available for thebenefit of certain victims of Nazi persecution the so-called &quot; out-of-time victims &quot; for whom the Prime Minister has suggested that something should be done.Printed for the Cabinet.

7. My colleagues may remember that the assets in this country of nationals of certain States with which we had been at war (Roumania, Hungary, Bulgaria),though liable to be taken by the Administrator concerned, were released ex gratia if their owners had been victims of Nazi persecution, provided that they had left thecountry in question. It was, however, impossible to keep this concession openindefinitely if the Administrators were to make their statutory distribution to united Kingdom creditors, and it was therefore necessary to apply cut-off dates(ifti 1:956 and 1957) for each country after which no application for ex gratia releaseof assets could be considered whatever its merits. I am sure that we had no alternative but to refuse all applications after the cut-off dates; there havenevertheless been a number of cases of genuine hardship and it has been difficultto satisfy the applicants that they were not unfairly treated because they were&quot; out-of-time &quot;.8. There is also available for the relief of the &quot; out-of-time victims &quot; some 40,000 which the Roumanian and Bulgarian Administrators now have in hand(after paying all expenses and allowing for any possible deficit in the HungarianAdministrator^ accounts). Together with this, the  70,000 residue from thedistribution should be sufficient to meet the known &quot; out-of-time &quot; applicationswhich could qualify for relief, as well as to make provision for new applications.9. There is, however, one point which I should like to emphasise. We mustconfine the distribution of this money to persons who qualify as victims of Nazipersecution according to the tests we adopted and strictly adhered to in the past.There may well be pressure to admit as persecution any kind of ill-treatment ordetention. We have taken as the qualifying condition imprisonment or detentionin a concentration camp or forced labour camp or confinement to a &quot; closed &quot;ghetto. I am satisfied that any other test would be administratively impracticable,since there is no other point at which a clear line can be drawn. Moreover, if wewere now to modify this test, we should as a matter of equity, have to re-open allthe old cases. It is unlikely that there would then be enough money to go round.10. A Bill would not be required to bring into operation my proposals forthe disposal of the liquid assets. This would be done by a new Order in council under the 1949 Act; it would be subject to negative resolution. It is possible thatthe whole of the  70,000 residue from the distribution might not be required forvictims, but the Order in Council would contain provision for any moneys notrequired for this purpose to be paid to the Exchequer.(b) Disposal of &quot;Future Interests&quot;11. The question for consideration is whether the &quot;future interests&quot; (seeparagraph 4) should be given to the Germans. (This is a subject which has been raised with the Prime Minister by the Federal German Prime Minister.) It hashitherto been felt that it would not be possible to justify to public opinion in theUnited Kingdom the return of any assets to the Germans while certain victims ofNazi persecution, in particular those who are stateless, remained uncompensated.In an agreement of 5th October, 1960, with the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees, the Germans have, however, gone a considerable way towardsfulfilling their obligations on compensation to stateless victims. The negotiations on a settlement for British victims are still not concluded (because their future course depends on German-Austrian negotiations still in progress) but this subjectdoes not arouse such strong feelings as did the question of stateless victims. In any event, the release to German ownership of &quot; future interests &quot; would create goodwillon the German side which could be turned to good account in the compensationnegotiations. Reference could be made to this when a decision on &quot; futureinterests &quot; is communicated to the Germans.12. Return of these assets to the Germans would be a technical breach ofthe 1946 Paris Agreement on Reparations from Germany, but in defence we couldjustifiably say that the time had now come when we must rid ourselves of thistrickle of assets.13. The Foreign Secretary considers, and I concur, that we should agree nowto the return of &quot; future interests &quot; to the Germans. (There may have to be some minor exceptions to return to enable the Board of Trade to implement agreementsalready entered into with other Governments regarding the disposal of Germanenemy assets.)
Conclusions14. I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the following proposals for thedisposal of the remaining proceeds of German assets in the United Kingdom:(i) a further, and final, distribution to United Kingdom creditors of germany of a dividend of 2^d. in the  ;(ii) making available the residue from the distribution (about  70,000) forthe relief of certain victims of Nazi persecution;(iii) the return of &quot; future interests&quot; to the Germans (subject to the provisoabove).R.
