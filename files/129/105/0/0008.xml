defence effort it was appropriate that the Federal Government should take any measures open to it to moderate its impact. It was agreed that an increase in the purchase of arms by the Federal Republic from the United Kingdom could afford a useful offset. Federal Ministers stated that in accordance with its obligations towards its other partners in NATO the Federal Government will procure arms in the United Kingdom.

In this connexion the Federal Government expresses the opinion that early agreement within NATO on its arms requirements and agreement on common development projects should form the basis for a close long-term collaboration which alone will ensure the economic utilisation of the resources of the United Kingdom and Germany available for defence.

In accordance with these principles the Federal Government will strive,

(i) to expedite the current negotiations regarding the purchase of armaments to the value of DM.240 million specially the purchase of 105-mm. tank guns and ammunition;

(ii) to prepare in the framework of discussions between experts, which are already taking place, agreement on the common development of a prototype successor to the Fiat G-91 fighter which has been selected by NATO;

(iii) to continue the negotiations, in conjunction with the United Kingdom, on the problem of defence against low flying aircraft with a view to reaching agreement on a common development project in this field too.

The Federal Government also declares that it intends to select the British 105-mm gun for the further batches of the tank at present under development on the understanding that appropriate delivery dates can be met.

The Federal Government also intends that, in view of the joint development facilities already existing between German and British firms, the engine of a successor aircraft to the F-104G shall be jointly developed and produced and that the British Tyne engine shall be chosen for the Transall transport aircraft.

The Federal Government expects that, on the basis of the existing selection of arms and equipment and of additional orders, contracts to a minimum value of DM.1.2 milliard will be placed for defence equipment in the United Kingdom in the next five years.

The Federal Government expressed the opinion that under the auspices of the Anglo-German Steering Committee on Defence Research and Development an Anglo-German Working Party should conduct an immediate examination of all proposal for weapons which could be purchased in the United Kingdom or jointly developed.

The Working Group should report within 60 days to Governments on all present or future projects which are appropriate either for direct supply or joint development.

The two Governments agree that the total of the arms deposit placed by the Federal Government in the United Kingdom amounts to about DM.300 million.

The Federal Government is prepared until further notice and to the extent that the liquidity of the German Treasury permits not to charge payments for arms purchases to the existing arms account but to make payments falling due under contract directly.

4. Space Research

The Federal Government referred to the exchange of letters between Prime Minister Macmillan and Chancellor Adenauer on the subject of German participation in the establishment of a European organisation for the development of a launcher system for heavy satellites and welcomed the offer of the United Kingdom Government to dispatch a group of experts in the near future to the Federal Republic of Germany to discuss the technical and economic data on the Blue Streak rocket project for purposes of space research.

5. Relations between the E.E.C. and the E.F.T.A.

The Ministers reviewed the problems of relations between the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Association in the light of
the statement made by Mr. Heath at the meeting of the Western European union on the 27th February, and reaffirmed their determination to make every effort intheir power to resolve the outstanding difficulties.The Ministers were glad to place on record their conviction that the difficultieswhich have arisen in the past can be overcome.6. Aid to Less Developed countries the Federal Government stated that they regard the provision of economic aid for less developed countries as a continuing task for all Western industrialised countries. They intended to provide a total of DM.5 milliard for this purposefrom various sources in the years 1961 and 1962. They expected that actualdisbursements in this period would be very near this figure.They emphasised their intention that their financial credits would, as a general rule, not be tied to supplies of German goods.They stated further that the planned aid programme was not affected by the revaluation of the Deutsche Mark.SELWYN LLOYD.LUDWIG ERBARD.
