1 *COPY NO.    S fCABINETTRADE UNION ELECTIONSMemorandum by the Attorney-general on 13th July, the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with theMinister of Labour, to circulate a memorandum on possible legislation on trade union elections (C. C. (61) 40th Conclusions,  Minute 4).C (61) 9918th July, 19612.     I start with the assumption that any changes in the law relatingto trade unions to meet the situation revealed by the Electrical TradesUnion (E. T. U. ) case must be acceptable to the Trades Union Congress(T. U. C. ) or, if they are not acceptable to the T. U. C. , so obviously fair and reasonable and for the protection of the rank and file of the unionsthat if the T. U. C. do reject them there will be overwhelming public support for the legislation.3.     One criticism made by the Judge in the E. T. U. case was that many of the rules of the union were unintelligible and so gave rise todispute about whether or not they had been complied with.    another was of the fraudulent manner in which a rule had been altered.    I do notthink we should seek to impose any rules on the unions, nor do I thinkthat there is any machinery we can devise which will prevent fraud in securing an alteration to the rules.    The most that we could do is toprovide for independent examination of the rules to secure that theyare intelligible.    The object of this examination would not be to securethe adoption of a model set of rules.    The unions would remain free to make what rules they liked.     The examination would reveal draftingdefects, unintelligibility, unworkability and it may be points not provided for.I do not think that it would be a good thing for such an examina-tion to be conducted by a Judge.    That would savour too much of animposition on the unions.I would prefer the duty of examining the rules to be placed onthe Registrar, with whom the unions are not unaccustomed to dealing.I think that he should in the first place report the results of his examina-tion to the unions and that his report should only be made public if theunion refused to alter rules which were so unintelligible, unworkableor contradictory as to impede &quot;the lawful exercise&quot; by the workers and employers of their right &quot;to elect their representatives in fullfreedom&quot;.4.     If the rules for elections are made intelligible, that will facilitate detection of breaches of them and I think this must be thefirst step to secure fair elections.secret
5.     Now I come to the actual conduct of the elections.    The recentcase has shown the extent of the investigation required when there isconspiracy between the leaders of the union to rig the election.Whether the case comes before the Courts or before the Registrar, thesame investigation will be required.    I doubt myself whether therewould have been much saving in cost or time if the E. T. U. case hadbeen heard by the Registrar and I doubt whether the powers of the registrar to enforce discovery would compare with those of the Courts.But the bringing of proceedings whether before the Courts or the registrar in respect of an election will not secure that elections are properly conducted.6.     Some Unions go so far as to employ outside bodies to supervisetheir elections.    I suggest that the powers of the Registrar should beextended so that he could provide this service for the unions if they wanted it.    I do not suppose that supervision by the Registrar or an outside body will be a complete check against fraud.    Unless pollingstations are established, I can see no machinery which would be effective to stop fraud by branch secretaries.    But if the Registrarran the elections for the unions it would at least go some way to securefair elections and to relieve the unions of the risk of allegations offraud by their members.7.     If this proposal is accepted, I would not give the Registrar anyjudicial functions for that would not fit in well with his responsibilityfor elections.    It would be for the unions to contract in and to pay forthe work done on their behalf.    If they did not contract in and did not provide for adequate supervision by some outside body, they would remain open to allegations of rigging elections and to actions in theCourts both of which may be more frequent as a result of the E. T. U.case.8.     Both these suggestions can be presented as intended tofacilitate the task of the unions.    If they are rejected by the T. U. C. ,then I feel there is a fair chance of securing widespread public support for them.9.     I do not feel that the. proposal to give the Registrar powerssimilar to those possessed by the Courts will suffice to meet the public demand for steps to be taken to secure honest elections.    I hope - Imay be far too optimistic - that my proposals would appear soreasonable that the T. U. C. would find it difficult to reject them.R. E. M.-B.Law Officers&apos; Department, W. C. 2.14th July, 1961.-2-
