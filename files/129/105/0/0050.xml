(this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)copy no.     ^017th July, 1961CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT IN GREATER london memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome DepartmentGreater London council the Cabinet have already recorded their general view   that,except as regards education, the Government should accept the main patternfor local government in Greater London recommended by the Royal commission that is, a directly elected Greater London Council responsible for such functionsnotably planning, traffic and main roads - as need to be planned and operatedover the area as a whole, together with boroughs formed by the amalgamation of existing areas, which would be the primary units of local government(C. C. (61) 39th Conclusions, Minute 6).     There is no doubt that the alternative plan put forward by the five counties affected, for an indirectly elected jointbody with mainly advisory functions, would not begin to meet the real needsof today.Size .ofJ:he^ Boroughs2. The Ministers responsible for the principal local services were invited to consider further the size and number of the new boroughs and thewhole question how best to organise the education service in Greater London.We believe that in a conurbated area of this kind - to which we are justifiedin applying criteria different from, perhaps, any other part of the country -local government areas with a population as small aslOO, 000, as recommendedby the Royal Commission, would not be big enough.   V/e doubt whether itwould be possible to recruit enough chief officers of the right calibre or tofind enough suitable people to serve as members of some fifty borough councils and their numerous specialist committees.   And we think that administrativeefficiency and the need to provide adequate resources also call, in greater london, for bigger units of government.3. We therefore recommend that the new boroughs should each havea population of not less than about 200, 000 and that a fair proportion of them should be substantially bigger.   This means in almost every case amalgamatingexisting units, a process which is bound to provoke much resistance with adefinite political flavour.   We have taken account of the view expressed in cabinet that we should be in a better position if, in this respect, we acceptedthe pattern put forward by the Royal Commission as it stood.   But even thatinvolved a gr eat deal of amalgamation and it is not certain that resistance,to our proposals would be significantly more violent than to those of theRoyal Commission.   We think, at all events, that we should be ready to gofor the pattern which seems to us best on its own merits.
The Education service. The -Royal Commission recommended that, while the boroughsshould be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the education service,responsibility for policy and planning at the local level should rest withthe Greater London Council.   This proposal has, on the face of it, considerableattractions, but after careful thought we have accepted the view of theMinister of Education that a two-tier system of the kind proposed cannot hope to produce a really satisfactory service.   Clearly the Greater London Councilcannot be made the sole education authority for an area containing nearly one-sixth of the whole population and we are therefore led to the conclusionthat the Council should have no education functions at all.   This is likely tomake the plan as a whole more acceptable to the existing local authoritiesand we have little doubt that the remaining functions assigned to the council would provide them with interesting and important work enough to maintain their vitality.5. We also accept the Minister of Educations view that individualboroughs even of the size we now propose - that is, with a minimum populationof 200, 000 - would, in this area, be too small for the purposes of education.This is partly a matter of the recruitment of high-grade administrative staff but more especially of the maintenance and, indeed, development of freedom of choice between schools, which we do not believe could in practice be secured by administrative arrangements between independent authorities.We therefore invite the Cabinet to approve the Minister&apos;s proposal thatthroughout Greater London education should be the responsibility of joint boards constituted by grouping (for this purpose alone) the new borough councilsinto units with a population, in most cases, of the order of 400, 000.6. There are two main objections to this proposal.   First, thatit means dismembering the London County Council education service, whichis widely acknowledged to be a good one.   But if we are to re-organise Londonlocal government at all, that dismemberment is inevitable on any pattern.The effect could, however, be greatly mitigated if we were to provide asingle joint board for a large central area, straddling the River, with a population up to, say, 2 millions.   This would be nearly two-thirds of theLondon County Councils population and a very substantial nucleus of their service could be so preserved.   That is what we recommend.   We have considera suggestion put forward in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion that the educationauthority for the central area should be the Greater London Council itselfjbut we do not think that this would be practicable, partly because at leasthalf the members of the Council would be drawn from outside the central area and partly because the powerful local authorities concerned would be unwilling to be refused responsibility for education when it was being given to those on the periphery.7. The second objection is the probable reluctance of the localauthorities, and especially the three county boroughs in the area, to be grouped into joint boards.   Apart, however, from these three, the authorities will be acquiring for the first time a share in responsibility for what is perhaps the most important of all local government services and this givesreason to hope that any initial resistance to our proposals would not be longmaintained.-2-SICRETmo
Publication ^the^Gpvernment.&apos; s ,ryiews8. There would be every advantage, both practical and political,in making known our general views on the Royal Commission^ report asscon as we can.   The atmosphere Of uncertainty is already making it almost impossible to fill senior posts except by promotion and, if it is not soondissipated, could easily lead to suggestions that we were shirking a difficult decision.   We therefore suggest that a White Paper should be publishedsetting out our views on the report, the pattern we ourselves propose and our intention to legislate in the Session a.fter next.   Our proposals would be ex-pressed in fairly broad terms * and indeed the actual borough boundariesand the constitution of the joint boards for education would not be determinedeven in the Bill itself.   But we may not be able to get this ready before theHouse rises and the present month is not the happiest moment for publishingdecisions of this magnitude.   We therefore suggest that the White paper should be prepared at once and submitted to the Cabinet.Sjmimajry9. We invite the Cabinet to agree that -(a) There should be a directly elected Greater1 London Councilresponsible for planning, traffic, main roads and, broadly, the other,functions assigned to it by the Royal Commission, except education.(b) The area should be divided into boroughs with a minimumpopulation of about 200, 000, but with a fair proportion substantially bigger.(c) The new borough councils should be responsible for all local government services other than education and those assigned to theGreater London Council.(d) For the education service, joint boards should be createdwith populations of the order of 400, 000 but with a single board responsiblefor a central area having a population of up to 2 millions.R.
