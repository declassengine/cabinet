The question oftaxation is still very much in the centre of the exercise.

(6l) 43;  the discussions in the Cabinet itself;  and, I gather, inthe discussions among the officials, increasing weight has been placed upon the role of public expenditure both as an obstacle and as an instrument for bringing about competitiveness, growth and solvency.Description of the report.      The report therefore begins with a review of the prospectivegrowth of the national resources (paragraphs 10-52).    This presents a pattern of development of the economy based upon three points:-
SECRET(i)   5 per cent, per year increase in income per v/orker fromwages and salaries.(ii)    2,\ per cent per year increase in gross domestic product(G. D. P. ) per worker, and \ per cent per year increasein working population.(iii)    public expenditure in 1965-66 at 42.5 per cent of gross national product (G. N. P. ).5.      There is no doubt that this is an optimistic pattern.     It implies that: -(i)    The balance-of-payments problem will be solved duringthe four years to 1965-66, despite continuing increases in prices and costs, and by means which permitconsiderable expansion of G. D. P.     This would call for a growth in the volume of exports at nearly6 per cent per year - or nearly double what has been achieved in recent years in favourable, conditions of world trade.(ii)    The rate of increase of G. D. P. per v/orker will be faster than in the last decade.(iii)    The public will be willing to consume a smaller proportionof its extra income than it has done before.6.      One can see the arguments in paragraphs 44 to 52 that have led tothe adoption of this optimistic basis.    Eut there is no certainty about them.7.      The report then turns to public expenditure;  it shows the courseof expenditure over the last decade (paragraphs 55-62);  it then developsimportant considerations about the effect of public expenditure upon thenation&apos;s economic growth and solvency - the way in which the public sector itself (which directly employs nearly 6 million people and carriesout over 40 per cent of the nation s investment) uses its resources oflabour and capital (paragraphs 63-68);  and the impact on the private sector, both via taxation (paragraph 69) and via its effect upon the way in which it affects the private sector&apos;s deployment of labour and capital(paragraphs 71, 72) and especially the disproportionately adverse effectsupon G. N. P. of particular kinds of expenditure (paragraphs 73-77).8.      This is all in effect background for the &quot;plan&quot; itself, whichconcentrates on a few large programmes which represent nearly80 per cent of public expenditure (defence, aid, public investment,assistance to industry, agriculture, education, health, pensions andother benefits).     In each case a specific quantitative proposal or policyis proposed (listed in paragraph 139).
9.      The plan involves an increase of about  1,100 millions, at theprices of the first quarter of 1961, in total public expenditure over theperiod 1961-62 to 1965-66 (paragraph 118).    But in order to carry out ourdesideratum of 42. 5 per cent of G. N. P. , the expenditure could be allowedto increase by only about  1,000 millions (paragraph 122).    Thus, althoughthe basis of future resources is highly optimistic, the proposals havebeen unable to contain expenditure within the 42. 5 per cent.    If of course a less optimistic basis was used, the; proportion of public expenditure toG. N. P. would rise sharply.10.     Thus, the proposals, which are formidable in themselves, arenevertheless not enough to contain public expenditure within 42. 5 per cent of G. N. P. even on optimistic assumptions about the future of G. N. P. and about the balance-of-payments.    On less favourable assumptions, a rapid increase in the proportion of public expenditure to G, N. P. is inevitable.Conclusions to be,drawn11.     The trend for increased public expenditure is very strong - andthere are no declining programmes.     Defence, aid, social services,economic support - all are going up.     The public investment programmesplay an important (and probably previously under-estimated) role ingenerating increased current expenditure.12.    Particular importance is attached to a number of expenditureswhich are disproportionately more damaging to the economy than are public expenditures generally - oversea military and politicalexpenditures;   defence and other programmes which occupy the resourcesof management, technology and skilled labour of our most advancedindustries;   subsidies and loans which keep capital and labour in low-productivity industries and hinder its movement to high-productivityindustries.     Of course these expenditures have their purpose - but wemust not under-estimate their effect upon our economic performance.13.    If we are going to try seriously to put our affairs in order, thereis very little room for manoeuvre (paragraphs 124-128).     The reportdeals with the big programmes which account for the overwhelming majority of the expenditure and, although one can imagine switching thepercentages round according to choice, it is impossible to avoid theconclusion that this is the kind of thing that has to be done.     We had better do it quickly, for it will not become any easier.14.    If we do not take action on the lines envisaged in the report,we really commit ourselves to five years&apos; increase in the burden oftaxation - on the most optimistic assumptions.    On perhaps more realistic assumptions, there will have to be very unpleasant increases in taxation, accompanied by what may well be worse, a continuingfailure, because of our overloaded economy, to solve the problemsof inflation, growth and solvency.-3-liCHIY
15.     I would hope, therefore, that my colleagues would certainlyauthorise me ,to announce at once our intention of keeping the growth ofpublic expenditure in  step with that of G. N. P.     But I must make it quite clear that I could not properly make a statement of this kind, or indeedany other that was designed to give the impression that we were goingto take effective action to moderate the growth of public expenditureunless my colleagues were prepared to agree that this should be immediately associated with action on the scale and general direction ofthat proposed in the report.S.

Public Expenditure andResources1961-62 to 1965-66Reportby the Treasury to the Chancellor of theExchequerCopy No.Her Majesty&apos;s Treasury
-    PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND RESOURCES, 1961-62 TO 1965-66Report by the Treasury to the Chancellor of the exchequer. On 28th March, 1961, the Cabinet (C.C. (61) 19th Conclusions) took note of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s papers C. (61) 43 and 44, and invited him:to arrange for officials to work out a plan for the development of the public sector and its expenditure over the next four years, on the assumption that the ratio of public expenditure to the gross national product should remain at42-5 per cent, to examine methods of financing such expenditure, and toreport on the implications for economic growth, taxation and the balance ofpayments.2. In his Budget speech the Chancellor said (Hansard, 17th April, 1961,col. 793):&quot; Nowadays, all political parties are committed to a high and rising levelof expenditure on education, public health and numerous other public services.But although this is accepted, public expenditure must not be allowed to outrunthe prospective growth of our resources. It should not take too much of our resources from other forms of economic activity where growth is most likelyto come. We must, therefore, see that we get the priorities as nearly as rightas we can, both within the public sector and between the public and the private sectors.This calls for new methods. We need increasingly to look at all public expenditure together instead of piecemeal, and to look at it for a period of years in relation to prospective resources. I have recently set,in hand a study of thewhole problem of public expenditure in relation to the prospective future growth of our resources for a period of five years ahead . . . The object ofcarrying out the study which I have just mentioned is to see how we can bestkeep public expenditure in future years in proper relationship to the growth of our national product.&quot;3. The Plowden Committee on Control of Public Expenditure has recommended, as one of the basic principles of reconstruction of the system of decision-making in Government expenditure, that there should be regularMinisterial appraisals of public expenditure as a whole, over a period of years ahead, and in relation to prospective resources, and that decisions involvingsubstantial future expenditure should be taken in the light of these appraisals(Second Interim Report, circulated as C. (61)44, paragraph 11).4. The present report has been prepared by the Treasury, but the Departmentsmainly concerned have participated fully in the work. The report has beenextensively considered by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee, which is aCommittee of Deputy Secretaries and Under-Secretaries of 24 Departments underTreasury chairmanship. The Committee has a sub-committee on investment, and special sub-groups dealing with defence, with civil operations overseas, with assistance to industry and agriculture, and with social services. The membership of the Committee, sub-committee and sub-groups is set out in Appendix I. Thereport can in no sense be regarded as being agreed between the Departments or ascommitting them in any respect, but it has been prepared with their full knowledge and co-operation.A &quot;Plan&quot; for the Development of the Public Sector5. In accordance with the Cabinet remit the objective of this report is topresent the background for the formulation of a co-ordinated series of policies,covering the main public expenditures, designed over the period to 1965-66 to:(i) in the aggregate, keep within 42 - 5 per cent of the gross national product;(ii) make the best practical contribution to the growth and solvency of thenational economy.
For this purpose, we have taken a wide definition of public expenditure, includingspending from the Exchequer above and below the line, the expenditure from thenational insurance funds, the current and capital expenditure of local authorities,the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries, and the B.T.C. deficit.We take the period up to the financial year 1965-66; and base the work on theestimated public expenditure for 1961-62, within the framework of the accounts ofnational income and expenditure.6. The report covers a five-year period extending into the middle of the nextParliament, but it is concerned &quot;entirely with immediate action. The decisions which the Government are taking now, and the developments which are now takingplace in the public services, las a result of previous Government decisions, are infact determining the level oil public expenditure five years ahead. Except in a fewrelatively unimportant areas, it takes some years to modify the course of public expenditure, except in conditions of political and economic crisis: in formal terms the Governmenfs commitments do not extend very far ahead, but in practicalterms the freedom for manoeuvre is quite small. Thus, either the Government take decisions now which govern public expenditure for some years ahead, or thedevelopment follows implicitly from the momentum of what has gone before.7. The preparation of a &quot; plan &quot; for the development of the public sector isnot an attempt to predict the future or to gaze into a crystal ball. It is meant toprovide an appraisal which will help Ministers to take decisions which will control the future course of public expenditure rather than allowing it to be determinedby its own momentum. It is a matter of making judgments on the best appraisalthat can be provided of future resources and future risks.8. This work can be regarded as falling into two parts on the one side the prospective resources and on the other the claims that the public sector will make on them. But this is perhaps unduly simplified, for the future development of resources will in fact affect the size and composition of public expenditure, andthe future size and composition of public expenditure can substantially affect thegrowth of resources. About 25 per cent of the working population are working in the public sector, and public expenditure accounts for well over 40 per cent of the national product. So what happens in the public sector is of greatimportance for the national economy as a whole, and the public expenditure andthe national resources act and inter-act upon each other. If the composition ofthe public expenditure is favourable for the growth and solvency of the national economy, then it may become possible to sustain a larger public expenditure than would otherwise be possible, and vice versa.9.  The appraisal is made here in five sections:I. The Prospective Growth of Economic Resources.II. The Future Development of the Economy.III. The Shape and Impact of Public Expenditure.IV. The Framework of a &quot; Plan &quot; for the Public Sector.V. Conclusions and further action.I. THE PROSPECTIVE GROWTH OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES10. This section sets out the factors to be taken into account in any judgment of the future course of the gross national product. The G.N.P. is the total outputof goods and services produced within the nation (gross domestic product, orG.D.P.) plus the net income from ownership of property abroad. The latterelement is relatively small, so that the important question is the rate of growth of.D.P. There are three measurements to be considered:(a) growth of the working population;(b) growth of G.D.P. per worker at constant prices (i.e., productivity);(c) future level of wage and salary incomes.We first set out the relevant quantitative considerations, and then make an assessment of the basis that should be adopted for the immediate work.59187
Growth of Working Population11. In 1960 the Central Statistical Office made a forecast of the prospectivegrowth of the working population. This took account of the changing age and sexcomposition: it provided for increased employment of married women and forthe effects of later school-leaving and more university and other full-time higher education. It assumed that unemployment remained at a very low level.12. The 1960 forecast, which was made on the basis of 1959 data, showed anincrease in the working population between mid-1959 and mid-1965 of 623,000,equivalent to an average rate of growth of 0-4 per cent per annum. This wouldbe appreciably slower than the average rate achieved in the 1950s, which was about -6 per cent per annum. In the first year of the period covered by the forecast,however, the actual rate of increase was about 1 - 2 per cent. A provisional analysis of the figures for 1960 shows that the rise resulted partly from the renewed influx of West Indian and Pakistani immigrants and partly from a more rapid rise than had been expected in the number of women at work. If these two factors persist,the average annual increase between 1960 and 1965 would be appreciably higherthan 0-4 per cent, although neither the women, of whom many are marriedpart-time workers, nor the immigrants, who are mostly unskilled, can be expectedto contribute to output in full proportion to their numbers. For the calculationsin this report we use the figure of 0 - 5 per cent, which would produce a prospectiveworking population of some 25-6 million in 1965, compared with 25 million in1960.Growth of G.D.P. per worker3 3. The technique is to determine the rate of growth in the past, and then to consider how this may be modified in the next four years. It is technically verydifficult to establish the facts, and the following two paragraphs sum up the resultsso far of the work of a special committee under Sir Harry Campion&apos;s chairmanship.14. There are two different methods of measuring the G.D.P. one from the&quot; output&quot; side and one from the &quot; expenditure &quot; side. The &quot; output&quot; method is,broadly, the extension of the index of industrial production, which covers about half the total domestic product, to cover the whole economy. Physical indicatorsof the output of goods and services, industry by industry, are used as far as they areavailable, but for some of the &quot; service&quot; industries, in particular public administration, output can only be measured in terms of the number employedor of the wage and salary bill adjusted to constant rates of pay. The &quot; expenditure &quot;method consists of revaluing all the various elements of domestic expenditure at constant prices and adding them together with adjustment for imports and exports.The two methods are thus largely independent of each other, except for those services where the numbers employed or the wage and salary bill provide the onlyindication of either output or expenditure.15. Over long periods, the two methods of measurement can be expected toagree. For the period 1950-60, the &quot;output&quot; method gives an annual rate of increase per worker of 1 - 9 per cent; the &quot; expenditure &quot; method gives 2 per cent.In shorter periods, the two measurements may diverge quite considerably. to measure the rate of growth over a period, it is necessary to select pairs of years inwhich the pressure of demand in the economy was roughly the same; if a boomyear is compared with a recession year, this gives a faulty picture of the trend.16. The following table shows, for the two methods, the average annual ratesof growth of G.D.P. per worker (productivity) between three pairs of years whichwere roughly similar in pressure of demand:The average rate of growth over the last decade has pretty certainly been about per cent per annum. It is also likely that there has been some acceleration since1957, which is more marked in the &quot; output&quot; than in the &quot; expenditure &quot; figures(the large increase in the index of industrial production in 1959 accounts for thehigh figure shown by the &quot; output &quot; method in 1957-60). A period of three yearsMeasured from&quot; output&quot; data(per cent per annum)Measured from&quot; expenditure &quot; data(per cent per annum)1949-561953-571957-601-61-82-72-11-92-1
is, however, too short for drawing deductions about long-term trends. On theevidence available all that can legitimately be said is that the annual rate of growth of G.D.P. per worker may have been slightly above 2 per cent in recent years.Experience in Other Countries17. The significance of the publicised international &quot; league tables &quot; is being examined by Sir Harry Campion&apos;s special committee: the figures are open to severetechnical criticism. President Kennedy, in his February message on economic growth, gave a figure of 2 per cent for the United States; the Scandinavian andBenelux countries&apos; figures may have been in the general neighbourhood of 3 percent. The annual rates of growth of CDF. per worker for France, Italy, west germany and Japan are claimed to have ranged between 3f per cent and 5^ percent during the last decade, and it would be generally accepted that their rate of growth had been much faster than ours or the Americans&apos;.18. The reasons fori these differences of performance are not clearly understood. There are special considerations in every country which couldaccount for the result attained. There may be some general significancein the fact that the countries with the highest standards of living, andwith the heaviest efforts in defence, aid and welfare, have tended to fare the worst;and that the countries in the aftermath of the greatest national catastrophes havefared best. But this is conjecture, and for the present report the only usefulconclusion that can be drawn is a negative one, viz., that there is no evidence thatany country can rapidly change its performance in rate of growth, and that theforces that determine a country&apos;s rate of growth almost certainly lie very deeplyin its social and economic structure and in the general attitudes of its people. TheUnited Kingdom annual rate of 2 per cent, it must be noted, is a rapid one byprevious standards.Investment19. It is relevant to the future course of productivity that in recent years there has been, in real terms, a continuous rapid increase of investment, public and private, from 16-7 per cent of G.D.P. in 1955 to 19-3 per cent in 1960, and an estimated 20-4 per cent of G.D.P. in 1961. There has been criticism of the investment/CDF. ratio as being low in comparison with other countries, but thisis certainly not valid at the present time. It is believed that there is a relationship between the investment/G.D.P. ratio and the rate of growth, but it is certainly nota simple one.20. Much public and private investment has no clear bearing on productivity.The G.D.P. per worker relates to the whole working population the half of thepopulation who work in services as well as those who work in manufacturing industry. Investment in transport and distribution and clerical mechanisationaffects the productivity of workers in services who contribute to G.D.P. in the same way as workers in industry. But there are large elements of investment private and public housing and social investment, for example which in a five-year periodcannot materially affect CDF. per worker.21. Nevertheless, it would seem reasonable to expect that the rapid growth of investment in the last five years should support a somewhat faster increaseof G.D.P. per worker in the next five years.Scientific and Technological Progress22. The Report of the Scientific Manpower Committee of the AdvisoryCouncil on Scientific Policy shows that there has been an increase from 1956 to1959 at the annual rate of over 9 per cent in the number of qualified scientists and technologists employed in industry; and it is expected that this increase willcontinue during the next decade at about 7 per cent per year. There is someanalogy with investment here. There is no evidence of the existence of a closecorrelation between the employment of scientists and technologists and the rateof economic growth: the Americans have more scientists and technologistsproportionately in their industrial population than the United Kingdom, but nofaster growth. There is nevertheless a general presumption that a fast increasein the former will over a long period have favourable results for the latter. Thegrowth in their employment thus gives general support to the view thatproductivity may grow faster in the next decade than in the last.
Working Hours23. The extent of future reduction in hours worked and lengthening of holidays is a difficult factor to assess, but it could be substantial. If, for example,another week&apos;s holiday became widespread practice in the next four years, unlessoffset by improved working effort resulting from the extra holiday this wouldbe equivalent to a reduction in G.D.P. per worker of \ per cent per year overthe period.24. At present, average hours worked in the United Kingdom are more thanin the United States, West Germany or France; and less than in Switzerland orthe Netherlands. As the standard of living rises we would certainly expect areduction. Movementun &quot;normal&quot; (i.e., basic) weekly hours are not a reliableguide, for they may be offset to some extent by changes in overtime. Changes inhours actually worked and in holidays depend, rather, on the shift of preferencebetween greater real income and greater leisure. After the post-war reductionsboth in hours worked and normal hours the former actually increased slightly upto 1955, but this increase appears to have been offset by an increase in paidholidays. The wave of reductions in normal hours which occurred in 1960 (andwhich was probably generated, as an alternative to wage claims, by the relativestability of prices in the preceding period) has led to some, but a much smaller,reduction in hours worked.25. It seems reasonable to expect at least some reduction in the workingyear, most probably through an increase in holidays, and perhaps also through some further decrease in hours worked weekly. This is a significant potentialfactor on the other side to the considerations in the preceding paragraphs.Balance of Payments26. The United Kingdom&apos;s external short-term position has been vulnerableever since the war. The hazards have become manifest during the past few years with an apparent inadequacy of competitive power in export markets, a seriousdecline in net invisible earnings and an expansion in Government overseas expenditure. When the economy runs into balance of payments difficulties theGovernment is likely to have to take action which may impair economic growth.Whether this is likely to be more serious or less in the 1960s than it has been inthe 1950s is a matter for conjecture; we examine this further in Section II of theReport. But there has been no change that could be adduced as a favourablefactor in the next four years.Appraisal of Prospects27. To sum up, the evidence is that the average annual rate of growth of.D.P. per worker has in recent years been slightly above 2 per cent. There hasbeen an increasing rate of investment and of application of science to industry which should provide some basis for hope that the rate of growth will be fasterin future. On the other hand, there is likely to be some reduction in the averagetotal hours worked during the year. There is the ever-present limiting factor ofthe balance of payments.28. There are two relevant opinions that have been expressed. One concerns the United States, where performance has been much the same as the UnitedKingdom&apos;s; the Joint Congressional Economic Committee last year made a veryfull appraisal of the prospects of the United States, and settled upon a range of average annual growth of G.N.P. per worker of 2 to 2-7 per cent, with &quot;themost probable assumption &quot; of 2-3 per cent. The circumstances of the UnitedStates are of course different from those of the United Kingdom, but some of the differences, such as reserves of labour and a less vulnerable balance of payments,would perhaps lead one prima facie to expect the rate of growth to be faster inthe United States than the United Kingdom.29. The other is the Iron and Steel Board&apos;s report of April 1961 on development in the iron and steel industry. In this report, the Board hascalculated the demand for steel on the assumption of an average annual rate of growth of CDF. per worker, from mid-1960 to 1965, of 2-8 per cent. This rate,which was chosen by the Board after far-ranging informal discussion with theTreasury, the Ministry of Power and the Board of Trade, with the steel industry
represented too, is described in the report as &quot;reasonably optimistic&quot; and &quot;notpresented as a forecast&quot; but as the &quot; sort of development that the iron and steelindustry ought to be prepared to meet &quot;. The Board&apos;s choice was designed tosupport its policy of encouraging the industry to press ahead with an expandinginvestment programme, with the main object of reducing to a minimum the riskof shortage in the future.30. For our present purposes, the fundamental policy considerations work inthe opposite sense to those which actuated the Iron and Steel Board. The resultof this report will be that the Government will become committed to certain levels of public expenditure far ahead. Once a forward &quot; plan &quot; has been made for public expenditure, it will be reversible only in conditions of great economic andfinancial trouble. We know that the economic future is highly vulnerable to balance of payments difficulties. There is great force in the argument that whenthe Government are deciding their forward expenditure commitments, they shouldtake a cautious view of the prospective growth of resources. If ultimately itturned out that the nation could have afforded somewhat larger public expenditure,because productivity had grown faster than postulated, we might regret havingforegone certain desirable public expenditures. But in the opposite case, ifproductivity did not grow as fast as postulated, the damage from being over-committed on public expenditure would be much more serious.31. The Chancellor&apos;s paper C. (61) 43 was based upon a rate of growth of.D.P. per worker of 2-\- per cent per year. The statistical evidence about the trend in recent years is now less favourable than it appeared to be before the1960 figures were available and before the examination by Sir Harry Campion&apos;scommittee, and we have had to give serious thought to changing to a lower figure.Indeed the considerations above would point to a figure of 2 per cent. However,there is the generally growing realisation of the importance of economic growth,which may be a relevant factor: and if changes were made in public expenditurepolicy in a manner which stimulated growth and helped the balance of payments,this too would be a constructive factor. For the preparation of the &quot; plan &quot;, wetherefore propose to retain the figure of 2\ per cent per year as the working basis.This would of course mean 3 per cent per year increase in G.D.P. and G.N.P.,taking into account the prospective growth of working population.Income from Wages and Salaries32. It was assumed in the Chancellor^ paper that there would be an increaseof 5 per cent annually in income per worker from wages and salaries. This followsthe experience of the last decade. Between 1952 and 1960, income per workerfrom wages and salaries, i.e., the bill per worker for total earnings, increased by54 per cent, i.e., at an average rate of 5- 6 per cent per year. The following are the increases year by year in the wages and salaries bill per head of the employedpopulation:	Income from wages	Increase per cent	and salaries per worker	over previous year	(Index 1952=100)	1953 ...	...      ...                105-0	501954 ......	110-4	5 11955 ......	119-4	8-21956 ......	128-8	7-9&apos;1957 ......	135-7	5-41958 ......	140-8	3-81959 ........	.......           146-6	.      4:11960........	......                154-5	5-4The past and projected trends are illustrated by the graph annexed to this report.Prices33. The main influences on price changes are the earnings and profits per unit of output and changes in import prices. With a 5 per cent annual increase in earnings per worker and only 2\ per cent annual increase in productivity, earningsper unit of output would rise by 2\ per cent. On the basis of past experienceit is assumed that profits per unit of output would also rise by 2\ per cent. Theterms of trade have been taken as remaining unchanged, i.e., it is assumed that

The essential consideration in this kind of table is that the pattern mustbe self -consistent; the aggregate money figures which are behind these percentagegrowths must add up consumption (public and private) plus investment (public and private) plus exports of goods and services must be equal to the total finalexpenditure at market prices. This sum, minus imports of goods and services, andadjusted to factor cost, must be the same as gross domestic product. Thus, withina given rate of growth of G.D.P. no item can be increased without reducing anotherone correspondingly. A variety of patterns can be made by ringing the changesbetween these items. The reasons for choosing this particular pattern are set out below.38. Public Consumption and Investment. The growth of expenditure on goods and services between 1960 and 1965-66 is consistent with total public expenditure of 42-5 per cent of G.N.P. in 1965-66, divided between investment,consumption and transfer payments in accordance with our knowledge earlier thisyear of the programmes and intentions of Departments. The rapid increase in public consumption, which consists predominantly of defence, education, and health, is to be noted. In 1952-60 there was virtually no increase in real terms the growth in social services was offset by the decline in defence. This change toa rising trend of public consumption is perhaps the most important difference inthe lay-out of economic resources in the 1960s from that in the 1950s.39. Private Consumption. This represents about two-thirds of total domesticexpenditure, and is not subject to control by the Government except to the extent that this can be done by general fiscal and monetary measures. It is thereforecrucial to the balance of the economy.  The rate of increase here postulated isimport prices would rise by the same proportion as export prices. Prices in theaggregate would thus rise by some 2\ per cent per year or 13-8 per cent in theperiod from 1960 to the financial year 1965-66. Some prices would of course riseby more than the average and others by less.G.N.P. in 1965-6634. The G.N.P. in 1960 is provisionally estimated at  22,300 million. Onthe basis of assumptions of 5 per cent per year increase in income per worker fromwages and salaries, 2\ per cent per year in G.D.P. per worker, and 0-5 per cent per year in working population, the G.N.P. in the financial year 1965-66 would be 29,600 million at 1965-J66 prices.II. THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY35. A pattern of development of the economy from 1960 to 1965-66 has beenprepared on the following main bases discussed in Section I:(i) 5 per cent per year increase in income per worker from wages and salaries;(ii) 2\ per cent per year increase in G.D.P. per worker, and 0 - 5 per cent per year increase in working population;(hi) public expenditure in 1965-66 at 42 - 5 per cent of G.N.P.36.  The following table sets this out:

Onthe basis of assumptions of 5 per cent per year increase in income per worker fromwages and salaries, 2\ per cent per year in G.D.P. per worker, and 0-5 per cent per year in working population, the G.N.P. in the financial year 1965-66 would be 29,600 million at 1965-66 prices.II. THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY35. A pattern of development of the economy from 1960 to 1965-66 has beenprepared on the following main bases discussed in Section I:(i) 5 per cent per year increase in income per worker from wages and salaries;(ii) 2\ per cent per year increase in G.D.P. per worker, and 0-5 per cent per year increase in working population;(iii) public expenditure in 1965-66 at 42 - 5 per cent of G.N.P.36.  The following table sets this out :Average annual per cent changes in real terms
equivalent to 2 -1 per cent per year per head of total population. This is a much lower rate of increase than the 2-8 per cent per year achieved between 1952 and1960, and there must be doubt whether the public will in fact be prepared to limit their consumption to this extent. The implied assumption is that people will inthe aggregate save 16 per cent of their additional real income. This behaviourwould be consistent with past trends. The expectation that people will be preparedto increase their consumption more slowly than before rests upon the view thatas people&apos;s incomes rise, they consume a smaller proportion of their incomes andsave more. It is assumed for purposes of this calculation that direct taxes take thesame proportion of personal income as in 1960 (which would be consistent withlower rates of direct taxes), and indirect taxes the same proportion of consumption(which implies an increase in rates or in scope). The actual outcome of coursecannot be foreseen so far ahead.40. Private Investment. The pattern envisages a much slower rate of expansion than in the 1950s, but this is to be expected. The 1952-60 period beganwith private investment controlled down to a very low level. As controls were removed, there was a tremendous spurt in housing, shops, offices and road transport, in addition to the rapid growth of investment in industry, agricultureand shipping. It would not be reasonable to expect this fast rate of increase tocontinue. The rate of growth shown is in accordance with recent trends, taking account of the latest available information about private investment in 1960 and1961. It leaves room for a considerable continued increase in manufacturinginvestment, which represents less than 40 per cent of total private investment.41. Imports. A slower rate of growth is also assumed for imports. Importsof industrial materials are assumed to grow at the same rate as industrial production(3-9 per cent per year): separate forecasts are made for other imports. If theUnited Kingdom&apos;s competitiveness was strong enough to get the export growthpostulated in this pattern, this would also limit the growth of imports of manufactures.42. Exports. The figure of 5-8 per cent for the average annual rate of expansion of exports of goods is not an estimate of what may be expected on thebasis of past experience. It is a calculation of what would be required after allowing for a surplus on invisible account of about  90 million (which is substantially morethan the present very low level). The postulate of the calculation is that the externalmonetary position, as measured by the change in short-term assets and liabilities,will be in balance in 1965-66, i.e., that the United Kingdom&apos;s net long-terminvestment abroad will be met without any call on the gold reserves or any furtheraddition to the United Kingdom&apos;s short-term external liabilities. This implies acurrent surplus on the balance of payments of roughly  180 million (as accountedon the new statistical basis). This figure, together with a positive &quot; balancing item &quot;of  100 million, which may be regarded as a normal unidentifiable inflow on currentor capital account, makes a prospective available total of  280 million (which maywell prove too modest) for meeting external capital claims, including the loanelement of an overseas aid programme (grants plus loans) of  190-200 million a year.Relations with the Six43. We have considered how this pattern might be affected if the UnitedKingdom were to enter a close relationship with the European economic community. The agricultural arrangements might well have a substantial effect upon public expenditure (but not on the table above, for the subsidies are a transferpayment); but these arrangements would hardly come fast enough to make a significant impact by 1965-66. The effect of the Common Market relationship asa whole would depend upon whether it improved or worsened the prospects ofsustaining the postulated rate of economic growth. The ultimate effects could be large, but it would seem doubtful whether within the next four or five years theywould be big enough to affect our present appraisal one way or the other.Balance of Payments44. The balance of payments is of course the vulnerable element in the wholepattern. In 1952 to 1960, in favourable conditions of expanding world trade, thevolume of United Kingdom exports increased at an average annual rate of just over 3 per cent. The consequences of a faster growth of imports than of exports were mitigated by the change in our favour of the terms of trade. To support an59187c
expanding economy in the period from 1960 to 1965-66, and the private andGovernmental net overseas investment described above, at the present favourable terms of trade and an optimistic forecast of invisibles, the volume of exports ofgoods would need to increase by nearly 6 per cent per year. This upward surgewould have to be achieved in conditions in which the United Kingdom price-levelwas rising at 2\ per cent per year. Whether this can be regarded as practicabledepends upon the view taken of world trading conditions over the next four or five years, and of course of our chief competitors&apos; costs and prices. But the validity of the pattern is clearly open to great doubt here.45. The Board of Trade consider that on the basis of past experience, thefuture long-term annual rate of expansion of exports of goods cannot be expectedto be more than 3-J- per cent on average; as in the past it will inevitably fluctuatefrom year to year, which might make the average between 1960 and 1965 higheror lower than the longer-term expectation. The average rate of increase in thevolume of exports of goods in the past 10 years has been about 3 per cent. Thereis no present reason to expect dramatic changes of trend. The Board of Trade&apos;view of export prospects is set out in more detail in Appendix II.46. In view of the serious doubt about the export postulate we considered whether we should abandon this pattern altogether. There are two alternative courses for this Survey. The first would be to take a more &quot; realistic &quot; rate of growth of exports, say, 3  per cent per year; adapt the rate of growth of imports and overseas investment to this; and moderate the prospective rate of growth of.D.P. as necessary. The amount involved is something of the order of  550 million in 1965-66 at 1960 prices, or about 8 per cent less imports and overseas investmentthan is now seen as required. This would imply a rate of growth of imports about half that shown in the pattern in paragraph 36, and consequently a much lower rate of growth of G.N.P., producing frustration and unemployment; and the ratio of public expenditure to G.N.P. would inevitably rise, involving a substantial increase in the burden of taxation.47. Nor can we reasonably plan on the basis of a &quot; solution &quot; by cutting the overseas expenditure bill by import and exchange control, so returning to siegeeconomy. The outcome would then be no better, for we could not expect toincrease exports by even Z\ per cent per year if we had made such a reversal ofcommercial and external financial policy and abandoned our present international obligations. A further possibility might be to make really drastic reductions indirect overseas military expenditure and in the economic aid programme (both ingrants and in loans) and try to bring the balance of payments into balance byoperating on the &quot; Government &quot; side of the account. But this in its turn wouldbe a reversal of military and international policy; and substantial reductions in overseas commitments could not be effected quickly. To &quot; plan &quot; deliberately for five years on the basis of this series of courses would seem to be less &quot; realistic &quot;than the pattern as it now stands.48. The second alternative course was to reckon that in order to increase our export income to the necessary extent, industrialists would have to compete moresharply in export markets and sell their goods more cheaply. This would implyincreasing our exports in volume by much more than the 5-8 per cent per yearpostulated (or correspondingly substituting for imports). Room would have to bemade in the economy for the extra resources needed to provide the increased exports or replacements for imports, at the expense of public and private consumption and investment. If it were decided that we ought to provide for extraresources of this kind, it would be necessary to provide for part of it at the expenseof public expenditure, for it would manifestly be unacceptable to put the whole burden of adjustment upon private consumption and investment. This alternativealso seems less realistic than the suggested pattern.Public Expenditure and the Pattern of the Economy49. In spite of the optimistic nature of this pattern in paragraph 36, therefore,it seems more reasonable to adopt it than to take any other course. For the purposeof making the &quot; plan &quot; for the development of public expenditure, we have to decide whether to accept the basis of 42-5 per cent of G.N.P. in 1965-66, or whether the&quot; plan &quot; should provide a lower figure of public expenditure, derived either froma lower rate of economic growth to take account of prospective balance of paymentsrisks or from the need to provide now for a prospective reserve of uncommittedresources for reinforcing the balance of payments.
50. Our judgment is that it would be wrong to make a &quot; plan &quot; on a lower rate of economic growth, for the right course must surely be to try to conquerthe balance of payments limitation in the next four or five years rather than to try to limit the economy to conform with it. But the argument for having anuncommitted reserve and thus for a lower public expenditure programme thanthe provision above is a powerful one, especially in view of the considerations inparagraphs 30 and 31, i.e., that the 2\ per cent rate was in any event greater than has been achieved in recent years, and involves a risk of over-commitment in public expenditure in any case.51.   The following conclusions would seem to emerge:(a) If public expenditure is to be planned on the basis of 2\ per cent annual average rate of growth of G.D.P. per worker, this would mean thatall governmental policies would have to be directed to strengthen thecompetitiveness of the economy the common essential condition for growth and solvency.(b) In particular, the development of public expenditure, both in size and incomposition, should be such as to support this aim so far aspracticable the power of the purse may well be the most powerfulweapon at the Governments disposal for this purpose.(c) The prospects of achieving this objective would be greatly improved ifthe average rate of increase of wages and salaries could be held to no more than the growth of G.D.P. per worker.52. We propose therefore to continue the work at this first stage on thebasis of the pattern as it stands, bearing in mind that the development of public expenditure which this would indicate may well be appreciably more than willin the event turn out to be sustainable through the vicissitudes in our external financial situation in the coming years.III. THE SHAPE AND IMPACT OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE53. The scope of public expenditure for the purpose of the preparation of a&quot; plan &quot; is comprehensive, covering Government spending of all kinds, above and below the line, whether financed by taxation or borrowing; the national insurance funds; local authorities&apos; current and capital expenditure; nationalised industries&apos;capital expenditure and the B.T.C. deficit. It is necessary to take a wide definitionfor three reasons:(i) The Government have a measure of responsibility over the whole public sector.(ii) The Exchequer and other sources of finance for the various public services are so interlocked that these services cannot reasonably be considered in terms of Exchequer expenditure alone. Local rates and national insurance contributions may be regarded as part of the tax burden inthe widest sense.(iii) In order to look forward, the Government must examine the expenditure at the point where it is incurred, not where it is ultimately financed:education expenditure, not the general grant; pensions, not theExchequer contribution to the national insurance funds; nationalised industries&apos; investment, not borrowing.54. The expenditure is divided for expository purposes into functionalblocks. First are the big blocks of expenditure in support of security and externalpolicy defence (A) and civil operations overseas (B), including the aid programme,information, diplomatic expenditure, &amp;c. These blocks A and B are self-contained;they include their own investment and their establishment expenditure, in theUnited Kingdom as well as overseas. The next group is civil investment (C), whichis handled together in the annual investment review and in the White Paper on public Investment in the autumn. Then follow eleven blocks of other civil expenditure (D to N): in (N), the costs of their central administration are groupedtogether. Finally, there are blocks for debt interest (O); miscellaneous services,including expenditure by the Northern Ireland central and local governments (P);allowance for increased costs (Q) and statistical adjustments (R).SECRET59187 c 2

56. During the period 1952-53 to 1961-62, G.N.P. in money terms increasedby 66 per cent, and in real terms by 26 per cent. The increase in prices was32 per cent.Ten Years&apos; Development57. The comparison with 1952-53 shows the extent to which the lay-out ofpublic expenditure has changed in the decade. The total of public expenditure has increased by 56 per cent in money terms, i.e., somewhat more slowly thanG.N.P. In the most recent period, public expenditure has been rising faster thanthe G.N.P.58. About one-fifth of the total expenditure is now in support of externalpolicy (A and B): about one-sixth is civil public investment (C): about one-half is other civil expenditure (D to N). The proportion of public expenditure for defence has been reduced from 25-3 per cent of public expenditure in 1952-53to 16-4 per cent: the period 1952 to 1954 was one in which defence expenditure was increased to a particularly high level following the decisions of 1950-51 onthe rearmament programme and strategic stock-piling. On the other hand, theproportion devoted to expenditure on civil operations overseas has increased from1 - 8 per cent to 2 - 7 per cent.59. Civil public investment still takes much the same proportion of public expenditure as it did in 1952-53, but this conceals a major switch from housingto roads, schools, universities, and other public building, and to nationalised industries&apos; investment.60. In the most recent period there have been large additional expenditureson loans and other assistance to private industry, on nationalised transport and on science. Comparison of the expenditure on agricultural support in 1961-62 withthat in 1952-53 is complicated by the consumer food subsidies in the earlier period.If these subsidies on home grown food are classified as a form of support for home agriculture, agricultural support now represents about the same proportionof public expenditure as in 1952-53.61. Education has increased between 1952-53 and 1961-62 from 5-5 per cent of total public expenditure to 8-4 per cent; health and welfare has changed little,and is about 9 - 5 per cent; benefits and assistance have increased substantiallyfrom 11-7 per cent to 15-3 per cent; debt interest is about the same (11-9 per centin 1961-62).62. The main characteristics of the decade, in short, have been a substantialreorientation of public expenditure away from defence and housing and towardsoverseas aid, assistance to industry and science, transport (road and rail),education and pensions.Productivity in the Public Sector63. The next step is to consider how the public sector uses its labour and capital. Nearly 6 million people are in public employment; and over 40 per cent of the nation&apos;s investment is carried out by public authorities. In highly educatedmanpower, the public sector is even more important. About one-third of thenation&apos;s scientific and technological research and development work is done inGovernment establishments (including A.E.A.): and public employment (the calculation includes teaching and universities, but not medicine or dental surgery)takes about half of the men and women with good Honours degrees. When thepublic sector directly engages so large a part of the nation&apos;s labour and capital resources, the efficiency with which it uses them is of first-class importance to thetotal of G.N.P. The first element in any &quot; plan &quot; for the public sector and its expenditure is to build up the efficiency of the resources engaged in the public sector.
64. First, we consider the nationalised industries including the Post Office.The following sets out their capital and labour force, in each case as at the closingdate of the last published account:	Net	Number of	Capital	assets	workers	per worker	  million	&apos;000	 British Transport Commission:			Railways    .........	1,621	520	3,120Other        .........	362	215	1,700National Coal Board......	894	640	1,400Electricity (including Scotland)...	2,317	205	11,300Post Office       .........	867	339	2,550Gas       ............	625	127	4,900Airways Corporations......	175	31	5,650	6,861	2,077	3,30065. Most of the nationalised industries, by the nature of their operations,are heavy users of capital. There are of course wide differences between them,but the average of  3,300 per worker may be roughly estimated as being more thantwice the average for private industry. The efficiency with which they use theselarge amounts of the nation&apos;s capital is of major importance for the growth of theG.N.P. At present, as was explained in the White Paper on the Financial andEconomic Obligations of the Nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 1337), the return on this capital is low (on average, less than 5 per cent after depreciation at historiccost, compared with about 15- per cent in private industry), although of courseallowance has to be made for the fact that the industries have to carrynon-commercial obligations. In many of them there is scope for increasing the productivity of the resources both of labour and of capital engaged in them, and,as the policy of the White Paper is put into effect, the G.N.P. would benefit bothdirectly through improved productivity of the 2 million workers and  7,000 millioncapital, and indirectly through the effect on the economy generally of more efficient fuel and power and transport supply.66. Second, the rest of the public sector employs over 3\ million workers.Some of the main categories are as follows:Central Government (figures for January 1961, except armed forces, which is for May 1961)W0Defence (including appropriate proportion of Ministry of aviation):Armed forces        .................. 479Industrial civil servants    ................ 232Non-industrial civil servants      ............ 126Civil Departments:Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance   ...... 3&apos;8Ministry of Labour...............      ... 21Ministry of Works.................. 24Agriculture Departments............... 19Forestry Commission      ...      ......      ...... 14Ministry of Aviation (civil)*      ......      ...... 13National Assistance Board        ............ 11Prisons       ............      ......... 10Overseas Departments     ............... other Departments         ............... 80Revenue Departments:Inland Revenue     .................. 59Customs and Excise        ............... 15Hospital Boards..................... 550Doctors and dentists in general practice      ......... 30Atomic Energy Authority       ...      ............ 40Northern Ireland.................. 45* Proportion of staff corresponding to proportion of expenditure not included in the defence budget.

Central and local government, like the nationalised industries, have intheir ownership substantial capital assets. Their annual investment on roads,defence installations, council houses, new towns, hospitals, schools, universities,water and sewerage systems, public offices and the like is about  850 million nearly as much as the total of private manufacturing industry. Some of the same considerations in relation to the national economy as a whole apply in the field of central and local government as in the nationalised industries. The &quot; output per worker &quot; of staffs in public offices may be difficult to quantify but can be improved by O. &amp; M., mechanisation and management efficiency. The &quot; return on capital employed &quot; in schools and hospitals cannot be expressed in financial terms, but the planning of these capital expenditures, and the efficient use andmaintenance of the assets created, so as to yield the best result at low cost, isa definite objective. If by efficient management the public authorities can providetheir services with less expenditure of resources of labour and capital, this releasesresources for other purposes and so increases the national product.68. We emphasise the impact of all this direct public employment on thegrowth of G.N.P., for there is perhaps a tendency to under-estimate its size and importance, and to concentrate unduly heavily upon the role of privatemanufacturing industry, which represents only about 35 per cent of the total G.N.P.Impact on the Private Sector69. Public expenditure has an impact on the productivity and competitive power of the private sector in three main ways. First, the public sector provides a framework within which the private sector operates: it provides defence, lawand order, and the Government administrative machine; it provides, e.g., throughthe nationalised industries, some of the essential economic infrastructure; and it provides social services, some of which, such as health and education, have a bearing on productivity (which cannot be quantified), the former by diminishinglosses through sickness, the latter by developing skills and adaptability. Second,public expenditure has an impact by reason of the amount and nature of theresources which it pre-empts from the total national resources. The amount is reflected in the levelof taxation, which in very general terms, over a long periodof time, is determined by the level of public spending. The amount of taxation and the structure of the tax system must have an important effect upon incentivesand risk-taking, and in general on the way in which the private sector works.Third, there is the effect of the direction of public expenditure on the distributionof resources in the private sector, and in particular on the extent to which itencourages resources of labour and capital to go when they will yield the best return.70. For the &quot; plan &quot; for the development of the public sector in the next four or five years, the size of public expenditure (as defined in this Report) ispostulated at 42-5 per cent of the G.N.P. Of this, a large part amounting torather more than 25 per cent of G.N.P. will represent the purchase of goods and services, for investment or consumption, by public authorities, i.e., the direct employment of people and the purchase of goods and services from the privateeconomy, and the investment expenditure of nationalised industries. Part of therest represents overseas aid and overseas debt repayment, which give overseas governments and organisations claims upon the United Kingdom national resources,which they take directly or indirectly either in exports of goods and services or ingold or its equivalent. The remainder of the 42-5 per cent consists of debt interestand &quot; transfer &quot; payments to individuals or private organisations inside the country old age pensioners, farmers, universities, steel companies. These transfer payments
give the recipients claims upon the national resources which emerge as private consumption or as private investment and consequently enlarge demand underthese headings, for which provision must be made in the pattern in paragraph 36.71. When considering the impact of public expenditure upon the private sector, we start from the point that the rate of growth of G.N.P. and the improvementof competitive power depend upon the efficiency and productivity with which boththe private sector and the public sector use resources of labour and capital. any improvement in productivity of labour, or movement of workers from a low-productivity industry to a high one, benefits the economy; likewise with the return on capital. There are of course cases in which the economic return to the community is different from that to the individual (clean air and the Local Employment Actmay be illustrations); or in which social or strategic considerations have to be weighed against economic and financial ones. But the basic principle is that themore the resources of labour and capital go where they will yield the best return,the better for national solvency and growth.72. The &quot; plan &quot; for development of the public sector should follow this principle. A primary aim should be to stimulate the most economic deployment of resources in the private sector. It is not to be expected that this aim can be directly applied in every field of public expenditure; but it should remain a guiding principle. Of course political and social considerations have to be taken intoaccount, but if these are allowed to prevail over economic considerations in the widest sense, this is at the expense of the competitiveness of the economy.73. The present lay-out of public expenditure has certain features whichhave been contributory factors in the indifferent competitive power of the national economy in recent years. We direct attention to three such features types ofpublic expenditure which, by reason of the special demands which they make orby their particular effects upon the distribution of resources in the private sector,have an adverse effect disproportionate to the amount of the expenditure as such.74. Firstly, heavy direct overseas expenditure -overseas military expenditureof about  215 million (net of local receipts), and overseas civil net expenditureof about  190 million in 1960. These expenditures strike the economy at its weakestpoint the balance of payments. It has been argued in respect of some of themilitary expenditure that without it the countries concerned would have greaterneed for financial aid which we should unquestionably have to provide and soincur this expenditure in a different form. It has been argued also that some ofthe foreign exchange cost both of the military and of the aid expenditure is recoveredlater in the form of exports which would not otherwise be made to the recipientcountries. But so long as we receive no payment for such exports, they bring no benefit to our balance of payments. The expenditure is then the same as any otherkind of public expenditure: it uses industrial resources which could otherwise have been used for the benefit of the balance of payments. In any case there arelarge amounts of overseas expenditure to which these arguments about possibleoff-sets cannot be applied. There can be no doubt that the aggregate effect of the 400 million of direct overseas expenditures on the balance of payments is muchgreater than that of an equal amount of public expenditure at home.75. Secondly, use of a considerable part of the output of some of the mostadvanced industry in the country for defence and related purposes. defence production and research expenditure is nearly  700 million a year; some of itoccupies the best capacity management, plant, scientists, skilled workers. about half of the total scientific and technological research and development for thewhole country is for defence. Modern defence must inevitably involve high-graderesources and personnel; and it is true that some defence work has beneficialby-products for commercial business, and that defence research and developmenthave contributed to industrial technology and to the growth of some of the mostmodern industries. It is also true that resources at present employed in defencecould not necessarily be quickly switched to other purposes. But any adjustment of defence expenditure of a kind which enables resources of management and skillof all kinds to concentrate to a greater extent on commercial work, as do theGermans and most of our other European competitors, and the Japanese, andenables the resources and pattern of industry to be reorientated accordingly, wouldbe a particularly effective means of improving our economic performance. Thequestion here is not simply that of the implications for taxation of the public expenditure on defence: it is the specialised resources which are involved in it.
76. Thirdly, the use of Government money to maintain labour and capital in employment of relatively low productivity. As the December White Paper(Cmnd. 1249) stated, agriculture has an important place in the economy, with about1 million people gaining their livelihood or part of it directly from the land. Theindustry ranges from farms which are very profitable indeed down to many whichbarely hold their own: but over the industry as a whole, the income per head ofthose employed in agriculture is some 20 per cent below the average of industry generally. As shown in the Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 1311), aggregatefarm income in the United Kingdom in 1960-61 is estimated at  359 million, which included agricultural support amounting to  265-J million. As the industry is noworganised the return on tenants&apos; capital, apart from the subsidies, is at most trivialand may even perhaps be negative. Of course there are valid considerations infavour of agricultural protection, but if its effect is to retain in agriculture labourand capital which could be employed with higher productivity elsewhere, the G.N.P.must suffer.77. Similarly in regard to Government grants and loans to industry.Expenditures in this field have increased from  15 million in 1959-60 to  135million in 1961-62. If the result is to steer capital and labour into activities whichyield less than the return they would obtain elsewhere -and this is usually thereason why Government help is necessary then again the G.N.P. must suffer.78. There are political, strategic or social arguments in favour of all thesepublic expenditures, overseas, defence, agricultural support and assistance to industry. But the direct impact of some of these expenditures on the balance ofpayments, and the effect of others in distorting the industrial pattern away fromthat which would most contribute to the country&apos;s solvency, are heavy prices topay. The analysis in earlier sections of this Report shows the great difficulty of finding a solution to the problems of the economy in the next five years on theexisting basis. The size and composition of public expenditure has an important part in redressing this situation.IV. THE FRAMEWORK OF A &quot;PLAN&quot; FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR79. The first two sections of this Report were concerned with the futured development of the resources of the national economy: the third was concernedwith the pattern and impact of the public expenditure and with the way in whichit affects the national economy. In this section is presented the framework of a&quot; plan &quot; for the development of the public sector and its expenditure for thefive-year period from the present financial year to the financial year 1965-66.The Nature of the &quot; Plan &quot;80. In this Report, the word &quot; plan &quot; is taken as meaning a co-ordinated.series of Government policies, covering the main public expenditures. decisions would need to be taken at once and put rapidly into effect. The &quot; plan &quot; is limitedto the public sector, and does not purport to set out objectives or policies for thenational economy as a whole. Much of it could provide a useful basis forGovernment policies in wider areas of general economy policy, but this is notthe purpose, except to the extent that the development of the public sector bearson these wider matters.81. The process of long-term review of public expenditure in relation toprospective resources is envisaged as continuous and flexible. This &quot; plan &quot; dealswith 1961 to 1965, but it is not meant to decide everything for the public sectorfor this period; to be followed in five years&apos; time by a second &quot; plan &quot; for 1966 to1970. It is envisaged that there should be an annual report, which would roll the&quot; plan &quot; forward by one year, and so steadily adapt the size and composition ofthe public expenditure to the developing needs and resources of the community.The objective to be aimed at is not a periodic and dramatic reappraisal of spendingpolicies, but a continuous process of adjustment. Important changes are necessary at the outset, for the various parts of the public sector are not in the aggregatealigned with prospective resources. But once a sustainable size and composition of the public sector expenditure has been achieved, it should be easier foradjustments to be made smoothly and over a period of years.59187D
The Large Expenditures85. For this first framework of a &quot; plan &quot; it has been decided to concentratein the first instance upon a few large programmes:A. 1.  Defence budget.B. 3.   Overseas aid programme.C. Civil public investment.D. Assistance to industry (private and public).E. 1, 2. Agricultural support and services.1.1. Local Education Authority services.J. 1.  National Health Service.J.2.   Local health and welfare services.M. 1, 2.  National Insurance and war pensions.M. 4.   Family allowances.86. These represent in the aggregate about  7,000 million of the 1961-62public expenditure (other than debt interest) of just over  9,000 million. Whenthe framework has been established, it should be possible to work out quantitativelimits or long-term policy criteria for the remaining items of the total public expenditure, or at any rate for that part of.it which is subject to Governmentinfluence and control.87. The following paragraphs set out the Treasury&apos;s proposed basis for the&quot; plan &quot; in each of the specified areas. The quantitative limits are then aggregated,at constant pay and prices, and with allowances for the non-quantitative areas and82. In this kind of &quot; plan &quot; it would be wrong to try to handle all publicexpenditures by the same technique. There are wide differences between them, intheir content and purpose and in their administrative management, and there canbe no question of applying universal treatment to all alike. No block ofexpenditure has a reasonable claim to a specific &quot; share &quot; of the national resources:nor is it reasonable to try to impose proportionate &quot; cuts &quot; (or &quot; relaxations &quot;) onall blocks of expenditure. What is important in the inevitable diversity oftreatment of the different kinds of public expenditure is that there should be ageneral appreciation by all the Departments concerned of the situation and thereasons for the action proposed, and a general understanding that this action is inaccordance with priorities which will make the best practical contribution to national objectives.83. One major difference between the blocks of expenditure is in the extentto which the policies which determine them can be expressed and controlled inquantitative terms over a five-year period. For some it is possible to lay downquantitative limits five years ahead, and for the Departments to mould their policies so that expenditure will remain within these limits. Pensions and similarexpenditures are in a special category: the controlling decisions are those on ratesand eligibility; given these, the expenditure follows automatically from the numbers involved and is predictable with accuracy. For other blocks of expenditure, wherethe expenditure is in fact determined by future events and contingencies whichcannot be predicted five years ahead, it is impracticable to lay down such limits:in these cases, the long-term policy must be expressed not in terms of a quantitativelimit but in terms of policy considerations and criteria.84. The &quot; plan &quot; includes all these kinds of long-term policy the various types of long-term quantitative limit, and the long-term policy criteria: all are equally important ingredients of the &quot; plan &quot;. Figures are given in the &quot; plan &quot;for 1965-66 only for those items for which the long-term policies are expressedand effectively controlled in quantitative terms: the determination of limits, withvarying degrees of firmness year by year ahead, gives the Departments theadvantage of being able to plan ahead with a reasonable degree of assurance.For those items of expenditure which cannot be controlled ahead in this way,estimates are made for the purposes of the overall calculations. In short, figures are determined for 1965-66 only where they are administratively meaningful and can be used to express policy clearly and without ambiguity.
for the smaller programmes are then related to the desideratum of containing theexpenditure within 42 - 5 per cent of gross national product. It was clear from theChancellor of the Exchequer^ paper to the Cabinet that this desideratum wouldinvolve changes of policy: what is done in the following paragraphs is to suggestmodifications of a broadly equivalent character, subject always to the considerationsabout growth and solvency in Section III.88. Defence Budget. Quantitative Limit. For the last three years there hasbeen an annual &quot; forward look &quot; at the course of expenditure for five years aheadimplied in existing defence policy. Given the necessary decisions on policy and programmes, it is possible for the Ministry of Defence, with the service departments and the Ministry of Aviation, to adjust defence expenditure to whatever long-term limits are established for the defence budget. When a long-term limit has been fixed, it will be possible to determine Estimates with a declininglevel of firmness for each of the Service Departments for each of the next five years,on the lines described in the Third Interim Report of the Plowden Committee.89. The 1961 &quot; forward look &quot; envisages an increase of about  180 million in the defence budget for 1965-66 over the figure of  1,680 million for 1961-62shown in Appendix III. This increase is almost wholly in the field of productionand research and is the consequence of the policy of ensuring that our smaller all-regular forces are properly equipped and highly mobile. This equipment needs to be increasingly complex to meet the growing sophistication of the threats which our forces must be prepared to counter, even though their tasks are not in themselves altered.90. The Treasury proposes that defence policy should be contained within anincrease of  125 million for 1965-66, and that it should be assumed that after thattime no more rapid rate of increase will be practicable. The reduction as far aspossible of direct overseas military expenditure and the demands on high-qualityresearch and industrial effort are of particular importance for growth and solvency.To contain expenditure in this way would involve difficult decisions, includingalmost certainly the withdrawal of some units from some overseas stations and acorresponding reduction in the total size of the forces. This would increase thedifficulty of continuing to carry out our existing commitments and the risks whichwould have to be run in doing so, though it might not necessarily entail theimmediate and complete abandonment of any of these commitments. But it is forconsideration whether a thorough-going reappraisal of our overseas commitments in relation to our resources would not be preferable to running risks on existing commitments by an attempt at limited economies.91. Overseas Aid Programme. The development of the aid programme isunder continuous review by the Development Policy Committee, and ministers have recently agreed (E.A. (61) 9th Meeting, Item 3) that every effort should bemade to stabilise aid disbursements for the present within an annual range of 190-200 million. The claims on us are growing, and there is no sign of themdiminishing for as far ahead as we can see, but their scale and urgency cannot be calculated five years ahead: what can then be afforded, moreover, will depend upon both the balance of payments and the national resources, and it is clear thatthe former will continue to be critical.92. Civil Public Investment. Quantitative limit. Since 1957, five-yearprogrammes have been considered together in an annual review. The reviewhas tended to be concentrated upon the next two years, for which Ministers normallyfix limits in July: the limits for the next year are now published in the White paper on Public Investment in the autumn, and the corresponding Exchequer borrowingis published in the White Paper on Government Expenditure Below The Line inthe spring.93. Our Investment Sub-Committee has considered the procedure for theannual investment review and for the management of public investment generally.This envisages that in July 1961, for example, Ministerial decisions would betaken as usual establishing for each programme or category a firm figure for 1962-63and a minimum (with possible margin) for 1963-64, together with aggregates for1964-65 and 1965-66 on the basis of which decisions could be taken on proposals by Departments involving substantial expenditure in these years.SECRET59187 D 2

This was based on last year&apos;s ministerial decisions. These decisions also envisaged increases of expenditure in 1962-63 over 1961-62 of  20million (minimum) and  80 million (maximum, not to be committed until after July 1961).95. It will be necessary first for Ministers to decide whether immediate action should be taken to check the growth of investment expenditure in the next two years, which is likely to run higher than was envisaged in last year&apos;s ministerial decisions. The factors here are the growing pressure on the building and civil engineering industries and the inflationary pressure in the economy generally. Ifnew work is allowed to proceed unchecked the consequence may be failure tocomplete work already begun, and an accumulation throughout the public sector of half-finished works in progress, with the accompanying increases in cost andinefficiency.96. When it has been decided how to deal with the prospective growth ofpublic expenditure generally, the next step will be to consider the longer-term basis of the public investment programmes. These are the core of the expansion and improvement of most services, and in order to restrain the prospective growth of current expenditure it is likely to be necessary to begin by reducing the capitalexpenditure which generates it. There are exceptions to this, where the public investment is designed to replace existing buildings at lower maintenance cost;but this kind of investment is only a small part of the total. Investment in the nationalised industries presents different considerations: the level to be permitted in each case is bound to be influenced by the success of the undertaking in achieving the target proposed for it under the White Paper, and in relieving its claim uponthe Exchequer.97. For the purpose of this paper, the Treasury proposes that provision bemade for public investment in 1965-66 at  1,950 million, at the Annual Reviewprice level. This represents an increase of  200 million above the foregoingestimate for 1961-62, and  258 million above the amount indicated in Appendix III.It will be impossible to proceed with the determination of programmes within thislimit until the short-term decision has been taken and until Ministers have takentheir decisions on the main framework of the &quot; plan &quot; for current expenditure.98. Assistance for Industry. Great importance must be attached in the&quot; plan &quot; to the improvement of the productivity of the resources of labour and capital in the nationalised industries as indicated in paragraph 65 above. This willbe reflected in the growth of CNR. rather than in the aggregate of public expenditure, and it is in this as well as in the reduction in the demands which these industries make on the Exchequer that the benefit will be felt from the effectivecarrying out of the Governmenfs policy laid down in the April White Paper on theEconomic and Financial Obligations of the Nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 1337).It would be self-defeating for the Government to try to prevent or postpone the increases in charges which this policy will require: such postponements would be bought at great expense to the Exchequer, and there is no reason to believe thatthey would sufficiently moderate the general increase in prices to have any significant effect upon the increase of wages and industrial costs generally.99. Within this heading of public expenditure is included the deficit of theBritish Transport Commission (present estimate  103 million in 1961-62). It is too early, yet, to fix a realistic quantitative target of reduction in the B.T.C. deficit:and no specific figures can be fixed at this stage for the degree of improvement tobe expected by 1965-66. This heading also includes the trading deficit (about 7 million in 1961-62) on civil airports and navigational facilities. This deficitwill diminish as a result of the growth of air transport and of the policy of makingground facilities for civil aviation pay their way.  Proposals have recently been94. The Annual Review will be put before Ministers at about the same time as this Report. The prospective growth of public expenditure on investment isas follows :
put to Ministers which include transferring the operation of the main airports to anew authority; if this is agreed it will no doubt involve setting a financial target for the authority, as has been done for other public enterprises.100. In the last three years there has been great expansion in Governmentfinancing of industry. The loans by the Ministry of Power for the expansion ofsteel strip mill capacity will be up to  70 million for the nationalised RichardThomas and Baldwins and  50 million for Colvilles. The proposed loan to Cunardis likely to be of the order of  15 million and the grant over  3 million. Thecotton industry reorganisation grants are expected to total  30 million over  years: the Ministry of Aviation aid for the development and production of civiltransport aircraft is some  10 million a year: grants and loans already offered tothe motor industry under the Local Employment Act are expected to total 29 million this apart from  17 million for provision of premises (for rent orsale): and there may perhaps be a further  30 million before this programme is completed. The aggregate of expenditures of this kind has risen from  15 million in 1959-60 to  135 million in 1961-62, of which  88 million is for steel.101. These loans and grants have become a formidable claim on public funds; and it is a new departure on this scale. If this policy of the Governmentcontinues, there will be increasing numbers of claimants. These claims arise formany reasons, but the most usual case is that large capital investment is requiredfor reasons of national interest prestige, local employment, or whatever it maybe but is not expected to yield a rate of return commensurate with the markefsassessment of the various risks involved. It is impossible to predict how these claims will come. The Board of Trade expects the claims under the local employment Act to run at a much lower level once the motor industry programme is out of the way; but this could be upset if a large but localised industry ran intocircumstances causing heavy local unemployment. There may be further pressure for Exchequer finance for steel, though none is now in sight: the proposal for developing a supersonic airliner might cost about  100 million: in the next fiveyears there may be proposals for Exchequer finance for shipping and/orshipbuilding and perhaps for ports (as well as the B.T.C. docks): other industries(e.g., jute, films) may call for Government-financed reorganisation in that time we cannot hope to identify all possible claimants five years ahead.102. This is a field in which the &quot; plan &quot; cannot be expressed quantitativelybut requires formulation in long-term policy. The basis of this policy on assistanceto private industry might be :(i) The recognition that all proposals of this kind that involve capital investment which will yield a lower return than that which is normalfor private industrial investment are an uneconomic use of resources,and except in special circumstances, will weaken the growth andcompetitiveness of the economy. They may cover the cost to theExchequer, but this is not material to their economic justification.(ii) There may be special circumstances of national economic interest whichsupport such a proposal there may be incidental wider benefits which make the economic return to the community greater than that on theparticular project.   But such a claim requires searching examination.(iii) There may be circumstances of social, defence or other non-economic interest which justify a proposal, but the full cost of this must be broughtinto the account when the decision is taken.103. The experience in appraising and managing proposals of this kind is widely spread through the Departments, but it is a field in which the criteria forjudgment are not clear or easy to establish. Moreover, the implications of any new departure are likely to spread well beyond the field of the Department directly concerned. The Treasury considers that it would be advantageous to have someregular machinery for pooling the available experience and for building uppractical working criteria of general application: it is suggested, therefore, that proposals of this kind which involve some significant departure should be examined by the Sub-Group of this Committee which deals with industrial and agriculturalexpenditures Treasury, Board of Trade, Ministries of Agriculture, Aviation,Labour, Power and Transport and Scottish Office before submission for ministerial decision. It is proposed to lay out resources on the assumption thatthere will be much less of this Exchequer financing in the next five years than there has been recently.
104. Agricultural Support and Services. This expenditure is not, at present,subject to quantitative limit. When the levels of guarantees have been fixed in theAnnual Farm Price Review, the actual expenditure will follow automaticallyaccording to the course of production and market prices. The guarantees can be changed in the Annual Farm Price Review, but the extent of permissible change is limited by the legislation, and the practical possibilities have been further reduced by the White Paper of December I960. If the present system of supportis maintained, it is impossible to be certain of being able to give effect to aquantitative limit for the Governments liabilities are by the nature of the supportscheme open-ended.105. The expenditure has increased from  264 million in 1959-60 to an estimated  277 million in 1961-62. Unless there is a major change in the world price situation, it is expected that there will be a continuing increase in the supportbill, for the present level of price guarantees and production grants, together withimprovements in efficiency, stimulates the growth of production; and the supplies available are running beyond what the market can absorb at present prices. It isnot practicable to forecast how the bill will grow, but it could increase by manyscores of   million.106. For a &quot; plan &quot; of public expenditure five years ahead, it cannot reasonably be assumed that the present open-ended system will continue, for it may wellinvolve unmanageable increase in cost. The Treasury has assumed that the futurecost of support and services will not exceed the 1961-62 estimated level, and that action will be taken by Ministers to contain the bill within this general area. If itis not possible to work on this assumption, it would be necessary to allow for asubstantial addition to this bill by 1965.107. Local Education Authority Services. Quantitative limit. The bulk ofexpenditure on education is undertaken by local authorities, and apart from school milk and school meals is treated as relevant expenditure for the purpose ofcalculating the general grant. This latter expenditure has increased from  665million in 1959-60 to an estimated  770 million in 1961-62. The EducationDepartments would expect it to increase to around  920 million by 1965-66assuming constant pay and prices. (This excludes, of course, the proposed teachers&apos;pay settlements, which would involve an additional  65 million.)108. The increase of  150 million in annual expenditure represents an averageof about A\ per cent per annum, made up of increases of nearly 2f per cent perannum for primary and secondary schools, nearly 9 per cent per annum for further education, and 7 per cent per annum for other expenditure (including loan charges and capital expenditure from revenue). The increase for primary and secondary schools reflects improvement in standards and new schools coming into use; thenumber of pupils will increase by only -J- per cent per annum during the period.About  53 million of the additional expenditure is for this purpose. Another 30 million is in respect of local authorities&apos; further education (almost all in Englandand Wales, including for this calculation the Colleges of Advanced Technology).Other big increases are for charges in respect of capital expenditure, expansion ofteacher training, and increased university student awards arising both from theuniversity expansion programme and from the improvements following theAnderson Report. Broadly speaking, the increases are mainly attributable to the expanding numbers of teachers and to the cost of maintaining and operating and financing the buildings which are being provided by the growing investment programme (equivalent to  750-800 million from 1961-62 to 1965-66).109. The Treasury proposes that this rate of growth should be moderated to 100 million (instead of  150 million) in the four-year period, i.e., to a rate of3 per cent per annum assuming constant pay and prices. (This would work outsomewhat higher for England and Wales than for Scotland because of the differing structure of their programmes.) The Education Departments point out thatthis would involve the reversal of the present policy of encouraging the maximumaddition to the supply of teachers and drastic reduction in the plans for startingbuildings during the next two or three years. It would, in their view, be necessary totake action quickly on the building programme if it were decided to moderate therate of growth as the Treasury proposes.110. The current expenditure of local authorities on education is not underthe direct control of the Government.  In order to moderate the rate of growth

The Treasuryit would be necessary for the Government to announce the aim of containing localauthorities&apos; expenditure within the new limit; to call for forward estimates from them; and to work out with them the priorities and the action that should be takenboth on the building programme and the supply of teachers, &amp;c, in order to keepexpenditure within these limits. This would of course result in a reduction in therate of growth of relevant expenditure for computation of the general grant, butit would be better to tackle the problem directly than to try to achieve the resultprimarily by exerting indirect pressure through the general grant.111. National Health Service. Hospitals. Quantitative limit. The health departments and the Treasury are developing a system of five-year &quot; forwardlooks &quot; for hospital running costs on similar lines to the system used for the defence budget, and there should be no difficulty in principle in administering a quantitativelimit, with a firm allocation for a year ahead, and provisional and tentativeallocations for the subsequent years. The difficulty is that there is no solid basis for judging what are the needs of the hospital service five years ahead. The nextsystem of handling hospital estimates which, it is hoped, will begin to be introduced in the course of the next year will gradually build up a basis for appraisal of needs,both for the development of the service and for getting better value for money.Allowing for this, the Treasury propose a rate of growth of 2 per cent per annum for the four-year period, which would give an increase for hospitals of  40 million at constant pay and prices in 1965-66 over the figure of  508 million for 1961-62.This would provide for bringing into operation the capital developments now inprogress and planned for this period, but all other extensions and improvements inthe hospital service would have to be financed from economies and greater efficiency.112. The Executive Council services the medical, pharmaceutical, dental,opthalmic services are not susceptible to quantitative control (unlike the hospital service). It is assumed that there will be an increase of  27 million at constant pay and prices by 1965-66 over the figure of  234 million for 1961-62.113. In both the hospital service and the Executive Council services, savings could be made for the Exchequer by further increases of charges, i.e., by continuing the shift of part of the cost from the taxpayer to the consumer of the service; butthe scope for this is limited by the recent measures which have already gone intooperation.114. Local Health and Welfare Services. Quantitative limit. The rate of growth of local health services can be controlled only indirectly. The Treasuryproposes that a Government statement should be made (similar in nature to thatfor education) that the rate of growth should not exceed 2 per cent per annum,giving an increase of  6^ million by 1965-66 at constant pay and prices over 79^ million for 1961-62. The Ministry of Health say that this would mean a sharp reduction in the rate of growth of these services and a reversal of the existing policy to accelerate the expansion of community care, especially for the mentally ill and the old.115. The growth of expenditure on welfare services (predominantly old people&apos;s homes) depends primarily upon the rate of capital expenditure: theMinistry envisage an expansion from 88,000 places to 116,000 by 1965-66, whichwould increase current expenditure from  28^ million to  40 million a year. TheTreasury proposes a halving of the rate of development, i.e., an increase of  61million to  35 million.116. National Insurance and War Pensions. Quantitative limit. Theoutgoings of the national insurance funds, and the payments for war pensions are determined, at given benefit rates, by the numbers who will apply for the variouspensions and benefits. The changes arising from changes in numbers are predictablewith reasonable accuracy as follows, at present benefit rates:
proposes that there should be no widening of the scope of these benefits. (It isimplied in this report that the rates of benefit would, in accordance with present government policy, rise broadly in line with earnings.)117. Family Allowances. Quantitative limit. The cost of family allowances,at the present benefit rate, is estimated to increase from  134 million to  141 million in 1965-66. If the two-child families which number two million were cut outof the scheme, and the help to the medium (three or four children) and large families (five children and above) raised to a rate of 10s. a week for the second,third and fourth, and 15s. a week for the fifth and subsequent children, therewould be a net saving of the order of  35 million on both the above figures.The Aggregate of Expenditure118. If the Treasury&apos;s proposals in the preceding paragraphs were accepted,the increases for 1965-66 over 1961-62, at the rates of pay and prices of the first quarter of 1961, would be as in the table below. The expenditures in the upperhalf of the table are major items in respect of which quantitative limits are applied;expenditures in the lower half are either items which are not susceptible toquantitative limits or are smaller expenditures not considered in detail in this report.

Most of the items in the above table are explained in the previousparagraphs. The &quot; other smaller expenditures&quot; include the Atomic energy authority, the Research Councils, universities, housing subsidies, road maintenance,police, national assistance, central and local government administration, and alarge number of smaller services. Provision has been made for these on a basis of restraint, and when the time comes to consider them in detail, some policy changesmay be necessary in accordance with the tone of decisions taken on the largerprogrammes.120. The contingency allowance is  250 million a cumulative increase ofabout \ per cent of public expenditure every year. This is a smaller allowance than was made in the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ paper C. (61) 43. It is meant to accommodate unforseeable expenditures which will arise in the next four years.Such expenditures will certainly come forward: the Government cannot commitall its prospective resources up to the hilt, leaving no margins available for changesin the course of events. It is impossible to compress existing expenditures quicklyin order to make room for new claims.121. It is difficult to say how much is a proper allowance to make. It is perhaps worth mentioning, however, as giving some perspective in this matter,that the Treasury made a long-term assessment of the national economy in thelate spring of 1957. The estimates that were then made for the year 1961-62 have turned out much too low. Public consumption of goods and services will this yearbe about  150 million higher, at 1961 prices, than was forecast in 1957.  Another
area in which expenditure has grown fast, and on a scale which could not possibly have been predicted four years ago, is the extension of Government loans and grants both at home and overseas. The precedent, for what it is worth, certainlysupports making a contingency allowance of  250 million in June 1961 for thedevelopment by 1965-66 of expenditures which are not yet in sight.122. The prospective increase in the aggregate of public expenditure, on thebasis of the Treasury&apos;s proposals and at the prices of the first quarter of 1961, isaround  1,100 million. In order to conform with the desideratum laid down by ministers that the &quot; plan &quot; should be within 42 - 5 per cent of prospective G.N.P.,the increase should not exceed  1,000 million* on the assumption of a 2\ per cent per annum growth in G.D.P. per worker (or 3 per cent per annum increase inG.D.P.). If the &quot; plan &quot; were based, as it well might be, on the rate of growth of.D.P. per worker actually achieved in the last decade, the public expenditure would have to be contained within an increase of  800 million. These figuresillustrate the momentum of expansion of public expenditure which is containedin the present policies of the Government. The Treasury&apos;s proposals forrestraining this growth involve difficult policy changes, but they are neverthelessinadequate to bring expenditure by 1965-66 within the prescribed level of42-5 per cent.123. The expenditures are expressed in terms of the pay rates in the first quarter of 1961. If the pay in the public services increased at no faster rate thanthat of wage and salary incomes generally (and correspondingly for national insurance and other benefits), it would be possible to accommodate the public expenditure within the same proportion of G.N.P.: if public service wage and salaryincomes went ahead faster than the general run, the expenditure policies would inevitably have to be re-examined.The Lay-out of Expenditure124. The proposals envisage an increase of nearly 11 per cent in public expenditure by 1965-66 over 1961-62, without allowing for the effect of higher pay and prices. (This is slightly less than the 3 per cent per annum increase in G.N.P.,for this year&apos;s public expenditure may be at least 43 per cent of G.N.P.) In thisfour-year period, there would be a considerable change in the lay-out of expenditure.This would consist partly of changes in Government financial support for public and private industry and agriculture, designed both to increase efficiency in theuse of the national resources of labour and capital and to reduce the demand uponthe Exchequer; and partly of changes of policy to moderate the rate of growth ofexpenditure on defence and social services.125. The proposed measures for industry and agriculture are of particular importance because they would help both to improve the G.N.P. and to reducepublic expenditure. They are:(i) a thoroughly effective implementation of the Governments policy for theeconomic and financial strengthening of the nationalised industries;(ii) the adoption of stringent criteria for the justification of Exchequerassistance to private industry;(iii) the adoption of whatever measures might be necessary to ensure that thebill for agricultural support and services did not rise substantially abovethe present money level.126. Within the public services proper, there would be some continuing shiftfrom defence to social services. The limits suggested, at constant pay and prices,would be equivalent to an increase in four years of 1\ per cent in defence, 13 percent in education, 9\ per cent in health, and 1\ per cent in pensions (the latterarising entirely from the increased numbers). In these services, there is very littleroom for manoeuvre, even when we are looking four or five years ahead. In orderto make quite small changes in the rate of growth of expenditure on defence and social services, it is necessary to make important changes in policy. Indeed to contain the growth within the limits indicated above, it would be necessary to take some steps which would give the appearance of reversing engines altogether.* This increase, at the prices of the first quarter of 1961, over the 1961-62 expenditure of  10,280million would be expected to lead to expenditure of some  12,600 million in 1965-66 at the pricesthen ruling, or 42 - 5 per cent of the G.N.P. estimated at  29,650 million in paragraph 34.SECRET59187 e
127. In much of this field, the prospective growth of public expenditureresults to a significant extent from the large and increasing public investment programmes of the last five years. It is accepted as being wise and economical to plan capital expenditure two or three years ahead. But these decisions have carriedwith them implicit decisions to expand current expenditure five or six years ahead,when the new buildings and equipment are ready to be brought into operation.In most of the great public services, expenditure depends heavily upon the number and status of the people employed soldiers, teachers, nurses. The forwardestimates of current expenditure show the sequence capital expenditure to expandfacilities, more staff to man these facilities, improved pay and status to attract the extra staff, &amp;c. It is likely, indeed, that over much of the field the most effective means of moderating the growth of current expenditure is to reduce and postpone the expansion of facilities by public investment.128. It would be possible to provide more room for manoeuvre by introducingspecific economies. Possible fields for consideration are family allowances (achange providing a net saving of  35 million a year is mentioned in paragraph 117);removal of the subsidy on welfare milk ( 27 million a year); increased charges inthe health service or in school meals or in university education; and there are other possibilities among the &quot; smaller&quot; expenditures which have not beenconsidered in detail in this paper.The Uncertain Economic Basis129. The economic framework of the &quot; plan &quot; is uncertain. First, it was shown in Section I that the grounds for expecting G.D.P. per worker to grow at\ per cent per year instead of the last decade&apos;s 2 per cent are by no means sure and at a 2 per cent rate,  200 million a year less public expenditure could be accomodated within a given percentage of the 1965-66 G.N.P. Second is the riskdiscussed in paragraph 39 that the public will be unwilling to reduce their rate of growth of consumption to the extent postulated if they did not, there would be serious inflationary pressures. Third, a failure to achieve and maintain a soundbalance of payments would undoubtedly enforce a major reappraisal of the &quot; plan &quot;sooner or later.130. In these circumstances, it is impossible to make any worthwhilestatement about the prospects for taxation. If all went well, it would seemreasonable to suppose that the total weight of taxation direct and indirect, local rates and national insurance contributions would be not much different from thepresent level in relation to G.N.P. There would be some possibilities of reducingrates of direct taxation, for in a progressive taxation system, as incomes grow,reductions in rates of direct taxation can take place even though the same proportion of income has to be collected in taxes. On the other hand, the yield from indirect taxation, the local rates and the national insurance contributionsdoes not rise in step with incomes. We cannot say at this stage what the balance would be likely to be.131. The upshot of all these considerations must be that the basis of this&quot; plan &quot; is optimistic. It is implied that the balance of payments problem will be solved, e.g., that the exports of goods will grow twice as fast as before; that theG.D.P. per worker will grow faster than before; that the public will choose a slower rate of growth of consumption than before. Even then, public expenditure wouldbe greater in relation to G.N.P. than the desideratum laid down by Ministers.The Importance of Time ;132. It follows that if the Government were to plan public expenditure on thebasis proposed, there would still be serious risks that the economy would turnout to be overloaded. The momentum of expenditure built into present policiesis so strong, however, that it is impossible to formulate a realistic &quot; plan &quot; that canbe reasonably certain of avoiding these risks. The adjustment of the rate of growth of expenditure takes a long time to carry out, and it will take many years to get the size and nature of public expenditure into a condition in which it can be regardedas being surely maintainable.133. The question of time is perhaps the most serious in the whole situation,for the process of expansion of public expenditure is a cumulative one, and thelong-term position is becoming more vulnerable all the time.  This suggests that
it is beeoming urgent, both in the field of industry and agriculture and in the field of defence and social services, to begin to take the action required to bring thegrowth of public expenditure into line with the growth of G.N.P.: and to build upa public understanding of the long-term problems involved.134. The slowness with which public expenditure will respond to the mostforthright action for containing its growth emphasises the need not only for taking this action quickly but for developing a policy to strengthen competitiveness andso to permit an expansion of the national product and thus its ability to sustain the required public expenditure. By increasing its efficiency in the use of labourand capital, the public sector can itself make a positive contribution towards this objective.V.-CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER ACTION135. The main conclusion of the report is the formidable scale of the problems which face the Government in containing the growth of public expenditure in thenext four years. A pattern for the growth of the economy has been selected which on any reckoning is optimistic. It implies that:(i) The balance-of-payments problem will be solved during these four years^despite continuing increases in prices and costs, and by means which. . . ; permit rapid expansion of the CDF. (in fact, no solution is in sight).(ii) The rate of increase of G.D.P. per worker will be. faster than in the last decade.(iii) The public will be willing to consume a smaller proportion of its extraincome than it has done before.136. It is found that so powerful is the momentum of public expenditure thatthe Treasury has not been able to make a practical plan which conforms,to the cabinet&apos;s desideratum that public expenditure should be contained within 42 - 5 percent of the G.N.P. To do this, on the optimistic figure of growth of G.N.P., itwould be necessary to contain the increase of public expenditure from 1961-62to 1965-66 within about  1,000 million at the prices of the first quarter of 1961.If the proposals below were adopted, the increases would be of the order of 1,100 million.137. It follows that the Treasury&apos;s proposals are a maximum programme forthe growth of public expenditure. If they were adopted in full, it would still belikely that further adjustments would have to be made in the course of the next three or fOur years.138. If the Government decided to plan expenditure according to theTreasury proposals, therefore, it would be necessary to direct Governmental policycontinuously to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy the commonessential condition for growth and solvency: in particular, the power of the purseis a powerful weapon at the Government^ disposal, and the development of public expenditure would have to be directed to support this aim as far as possible: andthe prospects would be greatly improved if the average rate of increase of wagesand salaries could be held to no more than the growth of G.D.P. per worker.139. The Treasury&apos;s detailed proposals for the main items of public expenditure may be summed up as follows:(i) The policy outlined in the White Paper on the Economic and financial obligations of the Nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 1337) should beenergetically pursued.(ii) Stringent criteria should be required to justify proposals for government assistance to private industry. Proposals of this kind involving somesignificant departure should be examined inter-departmentally before a decision is taken.(iii) Whatever measures are necessary should be taken to contain the annualbill for agricultural support and services within the general area of theestimated cost for 1961-62 namely,  277 million.(iv) The defence budget for 1965-66 should not exceed the estimated level for1961-62 by more than  125 million at 1st quarter (say February) 1961
prices, with special reference to reducing direct overseas military expenditure and demands on high-quality research and industrial effort.(v) The rate of growth of local authorities&apos; current expenditure on education should be limited to 3 per cent per annum, which would permit anincrease by 1965-66 of  100 million at February 1961 prices over theestimated level of expenditure in 1961-62.(vi) The rate of growth of hospital running costs should be limited to 2 percent per annum, which would permit an increase by 1965-66 of  40million at February 1961 prices over the estimated level of expenditurein 1961-62.(vii) The rate of growth of expenditure on the local health services should notexceed 2 per cent per annum, giving an increase by 1965-66 of 6^ million at February 1961 prices over the estimated level ofexpenditure in 1961-62: expenditure on the local welfare services in1965-66 should not exceed by more than  6^ million at February 1961prices the estimated level of expenditure in 1961-62.(viii) There should be no widening of the scope of National Insurance and other benefits and assistance.140. The proposals referred to at (iv)-(viii) of the preceding paragraph have all been expressed in this report in terms of 1st quarter 1961 prices (seeparagraph 123).141. It is proposed that consideration should also be given to the specificeconomies outlined in paragraph 128.142. The Annual Review of Public Investment will shortly be brought before ministers. It will include proposals to moderate the rate of increase of public investment in the next two years. It will then be necessary to decide the longer-term basis of civil public investment programmes, in the light of Ministers&apos; decisions onthe permissible growth of current expenditure, and the policies needed to increasethe G.N.P.143. If Ministers accepted the Treasury&apos;s proposals as the basis for the&quot; plan&quot;, the next step would be to work these into specific policies for implementation and public announcement; and to consider what further action was required to build up a public understanding of the issues involved. It wouldalso be necessary to review those expenditures which have not been considered atthe first round, and to develop quantitative limits or long-term policies for them.144. It would be necessary also to make the arrangements for continuingwork by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee on these lines. The structurewould appropriately be the preparation of an annual report, not unlike the present report but increasing in firmness as the expenditure becomes adjusted to resources;it would be based upon five foundations:(i) Future Resources Review (not unlike Sections I and II of this Report).(ii) Defence &quot; Forward Look &quot; which, it has been suggested in the ThirdInterim Report of the Plowden Committee, should be regularlyexamined alongside the Civil Operations Overseas.(iii) Annual Investment Review.(iv) Interdepartmental work on assistance to private industry (paragraph 103).(v) &quot; Forward Looks &quot; in alternate years, as proposed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in C. (61) 43, for the social services and for localgovernment services and finance.The timing of these various operations would require consideration.145. If Ministers approve this framework in principle, the particular policieswould then be worked out by the departments concerned, as necessary with theTreasury, for announcement as appropriate. A further report should be preparedby the Public Expenditure Survey Committee, for submission to Ministers in theautumn, which would:(i) consider the other expenditures which have not been considered at thefirst round, and make analogous proposals for them;(ii) work out a time-table and organisational pattern for future operations ofthis kind.

, 2. Our exports go to a wide range of markets which have been expandingat very different rates. Developed countries have increased their total importsmore rapidly than under-developed countries. There has been a particularly largeexpansion of imports into Western Europe. .     ,Table 2Volume of World Imports: 1953-59(1953=100)(Figures in brackets show the percentage increase from year to year)		Under-	Non-			Year	Developed	developed	European	Western	North	World	Areas	Areas	Sterling	Europe	America				Area			1954 ......	105 (4- 5)	109 (4 9)	110(4-10)	110(410)	92 (- 8)	106 (4 6)1955 ......	119 (+13)	117(4 7)	124(4-13)	125 (414)	104(413)	118 (411)1956 ......	128 (4- 8)	124 (4 6)	129 (4- 4)	134 (4 7)	116(412)	127 (4 8)1957 ......	135 (4 5)	135 (4 9)	138 (4 7)	142 (4 6)	117(4 1)	135 (4 6)1958 ...	135 (4-)	130 (- 4)	134 (- 3)	143(4- 1)	117 (  -)	133 (- 1)1959 ......	150(411)	129 (- 1)	136(4- 1)	158 (410)	136 (416)	144 (4 8)Average						1954-59   ...

The following table shows the increase in the value of our exports to different markets (volume figures are not available for all markets):Table 3Value of United Kingdom Exports to Different Markets: 1953-60	  million		Exports to:			Percentage increase	1953	1960	Sterling area.........	1,203	1,428	19Non-sterling area    ...      ...	1,355	2,127	57North America       ......	316	543	72Western Europe      ...      ...	698	1,030	48Rest of the world   ......	340	554	63The relatively low rate of increase in United Kingdom exports to the sterling area is striking. In fact in 1960 the volume of our exports to the sterling area was only about the same as in 1954, whereas, as Table 1 shows, the total increase in thevolume of our exports was over 20 per cent. The pattern of our exports has changed greatly. Whereas 10 years ago half our exports went to the sterling area,only 40 per cent did so in 1960. Over the same period the proportion of our exports going to North America and Western Europe has increased from about40 to about 45 per cent. The commodity pattern of exports has also changed.About 45 per cent of our exports in 1960 consisted of engineering goods comparedwith less than 40 per cent 10 years ago (and only 20 per cent before the war). Overthe last decade the proportion of our exports accounted for by textiles have decreased from about 15 to less than 10 per cent. These changes are relevant toforecasting the future volume of exports.Prospects to 19654. Over the past decade, our exports have on the whole increased most in years when world trade was most buoyant and conversely have fallen when world trade has fallen. It must be assumed that in coming years world trade will generallycontinue to expand but the prospects for expansion are not the same in all markets.
5. Exports to the sterling area still accounts for 40 per cent of our exports and thus greatly affect the level of our total exports. It is probable that totalimports into sterling area countries will not increase very rapidly though this will depend on whether the terms of trade move in their favour. It is also probablethat our share of sterling area markets will continue to decline. Our share may,however, fall rather more slowly once the full effects of removal of discrimination in our favour have worked through. On this account a rather greater increase inour exports to the sterling area is possible in the coming years.6. We think it likely that our exports to Western Europe will continue to grow quickly. They might grow more quickly still by 1965 if, say, by 1963 therewere to be a close association with the European Economic Community or, indeed,if it were evident by that time that there was a clear prospect of such associationbeing achieved. Exports to North America should also continue to expand(though they seem likely to remain liable to more marked fluctuations in sympathy with the state of the United States economy than exports to Western Europe) butthe ;rate of increase may not be so great as in recent years. Exports to north america have been greatly helped by a very rapid expansion in exports of cars.Car exports have now fallen sharply and it is unlikely that there will be any earlyrecovery.7. There seems no reason why world trade should grow more rapidly in theperiod up to 1965 than it has over the past decade and the foregoing provides no obvious reason why the rate of expansion of our exports should be very different from what has been achieved in recent years. There are, however, certain reasonsfor suggesting that the rate of increase may be a little greater rather than a little less. First, the rate at which our share of sterling markets has fallen may declineand increased aid expenditure may help sterling countries and other primaryproducers to increase, their imports. Secondly, a greater proportion of our exportsnow goes into the expanding markets in industrial countries and consists of thekind of goods (e.g., machinery) in which world trade is likely to continue to bemore buoyant. Thirdly, the export drive and assistance of various kinds toexporters should show some result in securing a wider participation by firms inexporting. For these reasons the average rate of expansion in the volume of our exports may be as much as 3^ per cent a year, compared with what seems to bean average rate of 3 per cent over recent years.8. There will inevitably continue to be fluctuations from year to year and itcannot be certain that over the comparatively short period up to 1965, the averagewill not in fact be higher or lower than the longer term expectation. It could turnout to be as high as 4 per cent or it could be as low as 2\ per cent.9. We think, therefore, that it would be rash to make any assumption thatthe average rate of increase in the volume of exports up to 1965 would exceedZ\ per cent. It will be realised that any forecast of exports inevitably involvesimplied assumptions about the state and conditions of the United kingdom economy and about the rate of growth of world production and trade. Thus toadopt a figure for the rate of increase in our exports very different from what hasbeen achieved over the past decade would imply that conditions in the UnitedKingdom or in the world, or both, would undergo a very rapid and substantial change from those which have prevailed up to now. Moreover, it should not be overlooked that imports and exports are not wholly independent. If, for example,it should turn out that our exports increase quickly rather than slowly our importswill be subject to similar influences.
