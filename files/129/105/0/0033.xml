CARNET SYSTEM FOR aircraft memorandum by the Minister of aviation understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is concerned at the suggestion of dispensing with the aircraft carnet system altogether,or even for an experimental period of two years.   I suggest that duringthis period an alternative simpler control be tried out.   If this can beauthorised it would be good for tourism here and it would give us areasonable chance of negotiating comparable systems on the continent of Europe during a conference due to start in July.2. Under the carnet system the visiting pilot is required:(a) To obtain possession of his carnet.   This is a voluminousdocument.   I am arranging to have one copy available at the cabinet meeting so that my colleagues can see it if they wish.   It costs him some-thing between  5 and  25 to do this.   I regard this as a substantialimpediment to travel.(b) &quot;Without a carnet he is tied to the 27 Customs airports in thiscountry.    This is a  further impediment to tourism at a time v/hen airtravel in the United Kingdom is being   encouraged by many municipalauthorities.(c) Wherever he goes he is called upon to produce this massivedocumentation for clearance.3. I suggest that the interests of the Customs and Excise could resonably be secured by a much simpler system.   Instead of a carnetthe incoming tourist would be given a notice setting out the variousconditions of entry - that the aircraft must not be sold, must not engage in transport or other work for hire or reward or be used by United Kingdomresidents or firms.   The last two of these points are oddly omitted fromthe documentation which he at present uses.   At the foot of the noticewould be a certificate for his signature saying that he accepted the condi-tions and would leave within a specified time by a Customs airport.Customs would keep one copy and the pilot another.4. To help enforce this system at all aerodromes, and not onlyCustoms airports, I would be willing to ask all aerodrome   authoritiesto inform us of any apparent breach.   To prevent an aircraft being soldwhile here, my Department would check Customs clearance before accepting the transfer of any aircraft to the United Kingdom register.   The check on the time limit for departure would work as it does for the carnet.C.(61) 83 COPY NO. 5321st June, 1961CABINET
secret. I suggest that I be invited to work out a system on these lineswith the Chancellor of the Exchequer as being simpler, cheaper and quite as effective as the present carnet system.   We could try it duringthe experimental period and if it worked we could make it permanent.It would not include the Royal Aero Club guarantee but I understand thishas only in practice been used in a case where, after the aircraft hascrashed, the Customs wished to levy duty on the salvagable remains.P. T.Ministry of Aviation, W. C. 2.20th June, 1961
