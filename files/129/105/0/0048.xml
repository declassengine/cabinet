C. (6l) 40th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.        I can see no advantage in delaying the announcment of higher charges.   If we delay until October, we lose some millions in receipts from the extra charges;   we lose the deterrent effect onthe demand for telephones.   The operation is a xiseful anti-inflationaryinfluence, which I need as quickly as possible.   The Postmaster-Generals proposals are in complete agreement with, and are indeedessential to my general plan.3.        It would seem best for the P stmaster-General to make his statement as early as possible, for I would like to get this out ofthe way before my statement.
