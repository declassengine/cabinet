IMPORTS OF UNITED STATES coal memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI agree with the Minister of Power that the application by the SteelCompany of Wales for permission to import 250, 000 tons of coking coal from the United States raises important issues of policy.2.      Hitherto the Coal Board have had a virtual monopoly on theimports of coal into the United Kingdom.    This was not provided forin the Act nationalising coal-mines.    It is very doubtful whether thismonopoly position should be maintained and whether the time has not come when fuel users should be in a position to import coal when this isto their economic advantage.3.      The Steel Company of Wales seem to me to have made acompelling case.    I recognise however that if a concession were madeto them we shall have to deal similarly with other applications that are equally well-founded.    Quite apart from its own direct exports the steelindustry provides the main basic material of the engineering industry which now provides some 45 per cent of our exports.    There is nodoubt about the need for industry to adopt any measures open to it to makeitself more competitive in export markets.     Continental steelworks oncoastal sites are taking advantage of the United States coal to reduce their prices, thus gaining a considerable competitive advantage.    Even on .the modest scale of imports proposed by the Steel Company of Walesthere would be a substantial saving.    To allow access to cheaper coal would be some offset to the increased burden placed on the steel industry by the increased duty on fuel oil.4.      While I see the force of considerations which lead the Ministerof Fower to urge that the present application be refused and considera-tion of the issues deferred until the proposals of the Chairman of theNational Coal Board, Mr. Rob ens, for the future of the coal industry have been received, I am satisfied that the Iron and Steel Board areright in urging that the industry should be able to import coal for aslong as it is available on more favourable terms.    I fully accept that, if ministers were to agree to this, the Coal Board must be free to adjust their prices so as to be in a position to meet this competition.R.
