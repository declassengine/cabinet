Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1961C. (61) 68 Copy No.      g \26th May, 1961CABINETCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN ADENMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesLast year the Defence Committee concluded that British interests required theretention of our base at Aden. The Governor and I have since examined possible ways of securing the free use of our defence facilities in the Colony and Protectoratewith the greatest practicable measure of consent for as long as possible during thisdecade.Political Situation in Aden Colony2. The Colony has a measure of responsible government, with theco-operation and support of the more moderate elements in the population. their leaders, who are Ministers in the Executive Council responsible for a number ofcivil departments, demand further constitutional advance for the Colony. the pressure of Arab nationalism in and outside the Colony sharpens this demand.The nationalists dominate the Trade Union movement and draw their mass strengthfrom immigrant labour from the Yemen and the Protectorate, and we cannot expect co-operation from them. We can expect it from the moderate leaders, ifwe enable them to oppose their nationalist critics with the authority of increasedresponsibilities. Their ultimate aim can only be complete independence, but their first aim is management of the Colony&apos;s internal affairs by the &quot; Adenese &quot;. Theyacknowledge that Aden Colony could not stand alone in the modern world andrecognise that their security and prosperity are closely linked with the Britishconnexion. I believe that, if we meet their wishes, we can help them to withstandpressure from the nationalists and retain our defence facilities with the consent ofthe moderate element of the population.The Idea of Merger with the Federation3. As the Colony cannot stand alone, the moderates favour closer association with the Federation of Amirates of the South, which now comprises mostof the Western Protectorate and is the Colony&apos;s hinterland. The Federation, likeits component States, is under our protection and has placed responsibility for itsexternal relations, defence and security in our hands. We are pledged, in the Anglo-Federation Treaty of 1959, to develop it so that it can ultimately become anindependent State. The Colony moderates see in a merger with the Federation theopportunity to come within this pledge and envisage that eventually the States inthe Eastern Protectorate and the islands should also join to form a new entity inSouth Arabia. They do not wish to rush matters because of the differences of economic, political and social outlook between the Colony and the Federation.Government in the Colony is of a representative and parliamentary kind; in theFederation the traditional Rulers have complete authority and are themselves theMinisters. Constitutionally the Colony is some way behind the Federation, overwhose internal affairs we have no jurisdiction; an additional reason why the Colonymoderates want some increase of internal responsibility is that they may be betterplaced before negotiations about closer association with the Federation are started.59052
4. The Federal Rulers are also keenly interested in closer association and inthe creation of a wider entity, but their approach is somewhat different. they regard the Colony as part of the territory of the State of Lahej (one of the mostimportant States in the Federation). While they are prepared to see Britishauthority over the Colony continue, they would oppose the withdrawal of ourjurisdiction and presence from the Colony. They instinctively distrust the townArab whom the moderate leaders represent; but a deeper motive is their fear that,without the British presence, the moderate leaders could not long sustain themselves against the nationalists (who are bitterly opposed to the Rulers). The Rulers?friendship for the British connexion is real; almost alone among the Arab leaders,they have stood by us during recent difficult years. Rather than accept anyweakening of British authority and control in the Colony, they would like us to force through an early union between it and the Federation.5. We thus have, in the Colony and in the Federation, political leaders whowant to retain our military presence, who believe in a merger between the colony and Federation and who look eventually to a new entity embracing the Colony, the protectorate, and the islands.Next Steps in the Colony6. We cannot refuse the Colony a further measure of responsible government.The expectation is widespread, the example of other countries too close at handand the opportunities which a refusal would give to the nationalists too considerablefor us to stand pat. We should lose the support of the moderates and be obligedto maintain our base against a sullen and hostile population. Given that we decide to go with the wishes of the moderates for wider authority in internal affairs, we canproceed in either of two ways. We can make the change as a step towards mergerwith the Federation or we can try to confine it to the Colony alone. The Governoris firmly in favour of the former course, (a) because it has the best chance of carrying the Federal Rulers with us in granting a further advance to the Colony, (b) because it goes with public feeling in the Colony and the Federation for a union of the british territories in Southern Arabia, and (c) because it holds out the best hope of ourretaining our defence facilities by right, and with consent, for the longest possibleperiod.7. The alternative of confining the change to the Colony alone might be immediately popular with the Colony moderates, who would interpret it asdesigned to increase their authority and establish their grip on Colony affairs. Butthe Governor does not consider that we would be allowed by public opinion, or bythe Federal Rulers, to. settle down for the further three or four years which wouldbe the normal lifetime of such a constitution. We should be pressed to make clearour views on union or on independence and we could not evade the question withoutweakening the position of the moderates and strengthening that of their opponents.Nor should we be able to prevent the Colony moderates making their ownapproaches to the Federal Rulers; we should simply have deprived ourselves of the opportunities to influence the kind of union which resulted. The effect on the Rulersof a decision to give the Colony a further measure of responsible government,without putting it into the context of a merger with the Federation, would be disastrous. They have made it quite clear that they would interpret it as a breach of friendship; and in losing this friendship we should reopen the Protectorate tothe kind of subversion with which we have been plagued for so many years. Weshould also jeopardise our present defence facilities in the Federal area and anyaddition to them we might wish, to have.8. I consider that the surest way to meet the wishes of the Colony moderatesand to retain the friendship of the Rulers is to authorise the Governor to conduct,during the next few months, a series of discussions with representatives of theColony and the Federation. The Governor should have authority to saywe support merger as an aim of policy, subject to the retention of our defence facilities, and invite the representatives of the Colony and Federation to discuss with us the basis on which it might come about. The aim would be to reach agreement on a new constitution for the Colony, to come into force as early aspracticable in 1962. We should be prepared to extend the lifetime of the presentLegislative Council for a further year beyond its present due date of expiry inJanuary 1963; the purpose would be to enable the new Colony Government formed in 1962 to narrow the present franchise (which gives the vote to British Subjects
and British Protected Persons on a modest residential and property qualification) soas to confine the vote to &quot; Adenese &quot;, excluding the itinerant labourers from the protectorate who are mostly nationalist supporters. The new constitution wouldprobably see the replacement of the present Executive Council by a Council of elected Ministers, under a Chief Minister, who would be responsible for the maincivil departments, with the Governor remaining responsible in his discretion for defence, external relations, and the Public Service. We should retain sovereignty in the Colony.9. We must do everything possible to obtain the support and co-operationof the Rulers. Before the Governor starts his discussions, I would invite a delegation from the Federal Government to come to London at an early date. Iwould tell them that we see merger as a desirable aim of policy and I would hope to bring them to see the advantages to them, as well as to ourselves, of our givingthe Colony moderates sufficient authority to enlist their co-operation against ourjoint enemies.10. It may be necessary to convene a Constitutional Conference towards theend of this year or early in 1962, at which the details of the Colony constitution would be formally agreed and the basis upon which in due course a merger mightbe established would be laid down; but we can consider the question of aconference in the light of the Governors discussions.Timetable11.  A provisional timetable for working out these arrangements would be asfollows:(a) Early 1962; the new Colony Constitution becomes effective;(b) Early 1964; elections in the Colony on a revised franchise;(c) Late 1964; beginning of substantive negotiations for a union under which her Majesty&apos;s Government would have, by right, responsibility for defence, external relations, internal security and, in the last resort,power to suspend the Constitution, resume direct rule and withdraw the Colony from the Federation. It would be desirable that if possiblethe Governor should continue to retain his responsibility for the JEofes f^^&amp;e.Service, but it may not be possible to insist on this. By acceding to theFederation, the Colony would come under the present Anglo-FederationTreaty; and our treaty rights would be a further buttress to the retainedrights described above.Special Points12. I told the Colonial Policy Committee that I proposed to exclude fromconstitutional changes in the Colony the island of Perim (which was placed underGovernor^ rule in 1959). The Committee suggested that it might also be desirableto try to exclude from any eventual adhesion to the union the island of Socotraand to retain some of our present key defence facilities in the Colony under UnitedKingdom sovereignty. The possibility of defining defence enclaves has alreadybeen considered and so far has been regarded as unworkable. However, I intend to pursue the matter further in consultation with the Minister of Defence.13.   I invite my colleagues to agree:(a) That we introduce in Aden Colony, early in 1962, a further measure of responsible government.(b) That retention of our friendship with the Federation Rulers is of paramount importance and we should seek to persuade them to agree to (a).(c) That we say that we support eventual merger of Colony and federation and be prepared to say that we regard these changes in the Colony asa first stage towards it, that in due course other parts of the protectorate and Islands (except Perim and possibly Socotra) may adhere.(d) That we retain, by right, our defence, &amp;c, facilities in the Colony afterunion takes place.I.
