The Economic Policy Committee have discussed a proposal bythe Minister of Agriculture for the reconstruction of the British sugar corporation so that the equity takes the form of a nominal shareholdingto be held either by the Treasury or the Sugar Board, while the existingordinary shares are converted into cumulative preference shares bearinginterest at 0 per cent and repayable at par in the event of winding up.The present ordinary share dividend is 7 per cent, and the Corporationcarinot increase the dividend or issue bonus shares without the consentof Ministers, but for about a year a vocal minority of the shareholdershas been pressing for the removal of these restrictions in view of thegrowth in the Corporation^ reserves.2.      The British Sugar Corporation are formally a public company,but in practice they are the agency through which the Government carryout their support policy for the beet sugar industry.    Under the Sugar.Act, 1956, the Corporation buy sugar beet from farmers at the guaranteed price and sell sugar at the domestic free market price which follows closely the world price of sugar.    Any resulting loss ismade good by the Sugar Board out of their levy on sugar and converselyany surplus is paid to the Sugar Board by the Corporation.    TheCorporation therefore make neither profit nor loss on their manufacturing and trading operations, but they receive from the Sugar Eoard a&quot;reasonable rate of interest&quot; determined by Ministers on their capital.This interest provides the funds for the payment of the dividends.The Corporation can also earn incentive payments, which were about 2.4 millions last year, for increased efficiency, but these payments are meant to provide funds for modernising equipment and are notavailable for dividends.    The Corporation^ reserves, which in lav/are part of the shareholders&apos; equity, are steadily growing and now standat over  7 millions, most of which is either committed to the creationof fixed assets or already in fixed form.3.      The Corporation have 5 million  1 ordinary shares, of which750, 000 are held by the Treasury, lj million by the institutions and therest by smaller shareholders.    The proposed reconstruction wouldrequire a 75 per cent majority of the shareholders present and votingat a shareholders&apos; special meeting and subsequently the sanction of theCompanies&apos; Court.    The Minister of Agriculture has been advised thatthere is a reasonable chance of securing the required majority if thereconstruction raises the effective dividend to 3 per cent, but that themajority could not be secured for less.C.

4.      Even if the proposed reconstruction secured the 75 per centmajority, it would still be open to the dissenting minority of shareholdei-to oppose the petition for the Court&apos;s sanction.    The minority might attempt this course on the ground that the proposed reconstruction wasnot merely a conversion scheme but an arrangement under which oneshareholder, the Treasury, would obtain ownership of the equity of theCorporation, although the preference shareholders would still beentitled to the face value of their shares.    The Minister of Agriculturehas consulted legal advisers at the Board of Trade and alsoSir Samuel Brown, a senior partner in the firm of solicitors which areadvising the Corporation,    He has been advised that, if the necessaryresolutions giving effect to the reorganisation receive the requiredmajority, the Court would be most unlikely to interfere provided theywere satisfied that no misleading information had been given to share-holders and that all the statutory formalities had been properly carriedout.5.      The main arguments in favour of the reconstruction are:-(a) It is anomalous that the equity of the Corporation should be largely in private hands.(b) The Government-appointed Chairman and other Directors of theCorporation have said that they find it difficult to oppose the shareholderagitation for higher dividends or a bonus issue unless they can putforward proposals for regularising the anomalous position of theCorporation^ shares.     They therefore submitted proposals which formed the basis of the scheme.(c) After the reconstruction, the private shareholders would receiveinterest at fixed rates and pressure for increased dividends and bonusshares could no longer arise.    This pressure, if continued, might well lead to embarrassment for the Government, but it is unlikely that the shareholders could succeed in a petition to wind up the company, inorder to secure the distribution of the assets, against the opposition ofthe Treasury.(d) A conversion achieved by means of a 1 per cent increase in thedividend would cost only  50,000 a year before tax, and the additionalmoney would be found not by the Exchequer but by the Sugar Board outof their levy on sugar.6.     The main arguments against the proposal are:-(a) There is likely to be criticism that a conversion into sharescarrying as much as 8 per cent gives undeserved benefit to the privateshareholders who bear no commercial risks and who should thereforereceive only the return appropriate on what is at present a gilt -edgedsecurity.(b) The shareholders&apos; agitation might subside if the Board announced the Governments firm intention not to allow higher dividends or abonus issue.    But there is a possibility that this might increase theproportion of dissatisfied shareholders.
(c) The shareholders&apos; demands for higher dividends have beenstimulated by the continued increase in the Corporation^ reserves as .aresult of their earnings under the incentive agreement, and the demandsmight therefore be discouraged by amending this agreement so as to moderate the rise in the reserves.     This might, however, affectadversely the growth in the Corporation^ efficiency and so increase their trading losses, which have to be met by the Sugar Board.(d) If the proposal failed to secure the necessary majority, thefact that the Governments offer included an effective dividend of8 per cent might encourage the shareholders to increase their pressure for higher dividends.7.      The Economic Policy Committee were divided in their views.A majority considered that an offer of an 8 per cent dividend as partof the proposed reconstruction could be defended as compensation to the shareholders for surrendering their rights to the equity and relinquishingall possibility of further increases in their income;  and that there wasadvantage in disposing of the shareholders1 agitation and the anomalousposition of the Corporation in this way.    A minority of the committee considered that it would be unwise to make such an offer both becauseof the criticism that an 8 per cent dividend would give the shareholdersan undeserved benefit, and in view of the risk that the offer might failand the shareholders would then be encouraged to increase their pressure for higher dividends.8.      Since the Committee were unable to reach agreement, I seek theviews of the Cabinet on whether the offer should be made.HAILS HAMOffice of the Lord President ofthe Council,   S.
