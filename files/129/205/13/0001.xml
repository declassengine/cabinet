SECRETUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 13COPY NO on20 February 1979CABINETCASH LIMITS 1979-80:  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. This paper responds to some of the comments made in our discussionlast week of CP(79) 10.NATURE OF ACTION PFCEPOSED2. As explained last week, it is too soon to assess the full scale ofaction which will be required to contain the public sector borrowing require-ment (PSBR) to the extent that we agreed and are committed.    That will befor the Budget.    Tax action will certainly be needed, but action on tax alonemay well be insufficient and the option of selective expenditure cuts maytherefore also have to be considered then.3. But it is clear now both that some action will be needed, and that asa minimum some squeeze of public expenditure programmes is an appropriatecontribution towards it; in any event we need to settle and announce very soonour policy on cash limits for next year.4. There is also a confidence aspect.    Many regard our policyconcerning cash limits as a test of our determination both to keep publicexpenditure under control and to maintain the fight against inflation.EFFECTS ON PROGRAMMES5.        I was asked to provide some figures illustrating the effect of myproposals on particular services.    I attach at Annex I two tables which showthe arithmetical effect on the planned volume of expenditure of the proposalsin CP(79) 10, if prices should rise 4 per cent above the provision in the cashlimits, and if pay settlements were high enough to trigger the full I per centsqueeze in central government manpower costs.    The figures given can onlybe purely illustrative;  the actual amounts would depend on the size of theprice rise and on the pay settlements.    In the case of local authority currentexpenditure which is assisted by the Rate Support Grant (RSG), it is not evenpossible to produce an arithmetical estimate of this kind, because it dependsnot only on levels of pay and prices but also on the decisions which the localauthorities are now taking about rates.1SECRET
SECRETCENTRAL GOVERNMENT PAY6. Some doubts were expressed about the proposal in CP(79) 10concerning the pay element in central government expenditure other thanthe RSG.    This proposal was that we should be prepared in due course toincrease this element in cash limits by 2 per cent less than would be neededto accommodate fully whatever pay settlements in excess of the guidelinesare eventually reached, with the proviso that the cash limits would not bebelow the level required to finance a settlement within the pay guidelines.7. In the light of the Cabinet discussion of this proposal I have re-examined the following options:-a. Increase the cash limits to accommodate the settlements asthey arise.    This would avoid difficulties with managing theprogrammer, but would add further to the borrowing requirementand would be widely criticised as simply financing inflation.b. To make no change at all in the cash limits.    This would bea satisfactory solution if the settlements were not too far removedfrom the provision already made.    But if adopted as a generalpolicy, it could impose great strains on the services where settle-ments were particularly large.    The cash limits system, andconfidence in our management of the economy, would be weakenedif we took this line and then found we could not hold it.c. To adopt   a new norm eg 9 per cent, and refix the cash limitson that basis;  and then say that no further increases in the cashlimits would be contemplated.    But the objection to a new norm,which we have already noted, is that the unions would simply regardthe new figure as a jumping-off point in any subsequent negotiations.Problems could still arise in individual services if settlements weresubstantially higher than the new provision made.    While it wouldcarry more credibility than b. it could still prove unsustainable inthe event.d. Increase the cash limits by some proportionate formula relatedto the settlement, eg half of any excess over a given figure. Thiswould be intended to give negotiators an incentive to keep settlementslow.    However, there is room for doubt whether this kind of threatwould in practice help to get the unions to agree to reasonable paysettlements.    It could be counter-productive by stiffening theunions&apos; determination.    It could also, if settlements were high,entail cutting manpower and services more than would be feasiblein the event.2SECRET
SECRETe. Increase the cash limits to accommodate the cost of the settle-ment, less a fixed percentage, eg 2 per cent of staff costs. Thisis the proposal in the previous paper.    It is open to the objectionalready raised, that once the settlement is as much as 2 per centover the existing provision, there is no incentive to keep it within aparticular figure (although, as just mentioned, the value of such anincentive is dubious).    But it has the advantage that it should begenerally feasible.    It would also enable work to begin at once onidentifying the staff savings, whereas under b, c.or &amp; the requiredsaving would not be known until after the settlement.    If savingsare to be found, it is essential that we start soon.f. To say that if the settlement is substantially higher than theprovision for pay in the cash limit, the position would be reviewed,with no guarantee that the cash limit would be increased.    But wewould add that in the field of civil service manpower, and so far aspossible in other areas, the extent of any increase in the cash limitwould be restricted so that at least the first 2 percentage points ofthe excess cost was absorbed by reductions in manpower. Thisoption would leave the Government free to impose a greater reductionthan 2 per cent if the settlement was especially high (thus retainingsome of the &quot;incentive&quot; effect of d.), and would enable work to starton identifying the 2 per cent cuts in civil service manpower. Itwould also give a pointer to the Governments attitude on othercentral government staff, without formally committing us to aparticular formula.8. Option a. is unacceptable.   Option b. would not be generally feasible,and would damage the credibility and effectiveness of cash limits.   Options c.and d. have some attractions if they would actually lead to lower settlementsthan would otherwise be the case; but this is questionable, and if settlementswere high they would run into the same problems ef feasibility and credibilityae b.    The only practical option is therefore my original proposal modifiedon the lines of Option f,, which retains the main advantages of my earlierproposal, without involving the Government in an open-ended commitment ifsettlements are especially high.SPECIAL PROBLEMS9. Any exception to the general policies proposed would weaken the impactof the announcement, and increase our PSBR problems and the need forcorrective action by tax increases or specific expenditure cuts.10. But after consultation with the Ministers concerned, I invite Cabinetto consider whether they wish some modification of the proposed policies inthree areas:  defence, the hospital and community health service, and theprison service.    Even in these areas, I attach importance to holding thenon-pay element in the cash limits, so that we can say that this rule is toaPply without exception.    This would leave the pay side:-3SECRET
SECRETi.    Defence.    I would be prepared to agree that Armed Forces payshould be exempted from the 2 per cent squeeze, which would thenonly apply to civilian stafftii.    Health.    I would be prepared to exempt staff in direct supportof patients.    The Secretary of State for Social Services would accepta reduction of  10 million (about half the full 2 per cent) in respectof other staff (ancillaries, administrative and clerical).    But hewants a limit on the extent of the volume squeeze on the non-pay side,at  25 million (ie adjustment in full to the extent that prices risebeyond 10^ per cent).    (These figures relate to England only;corresponding reductions for Scotland and Wales would give a totalof  40 million instead of  35 million.)   This open-ended commit-ment would breach the general principle I have stated.iii.     Prisons-,    My proposal is on the same lines - that the non-paycash limit should be applied in full;  but that on the pay side theprison service should be exempted from the 2 per cent squeeze,which would then only apply to administrative staff.LOCAL AUTHORITIES11. We must also give some further indication   of our intentionsconcerning adjustment of the RSG cash limit in respect of prospective localauthority pay settlements, including teachers (April), and administrative,professional, technical and clerical (APTC) grades (July).    I do not thinkwe should propose precisely the same approach as that just outlined forcentral government staff.    Even if we were to meet our share (61 per cent)of the wnole of future settlements, this will still leave the local authoritiesto find the 39 per cent balance.    Moreover, we are not the principals in thepay negotiations on local authority staff.    It would be a mistake to limit inadvance the flexibility with which we handle this.12. I propose instead that we should warn that the Government will in nocase contribute more than its 61 pe r cent share towards any settlement andthat, depending on the circumstances of the case, we will not necessarilycontribute towards the whole of a settlement.    To underline that we envisageanalogous pressure on local authority as well as central governmentexpenditure, we should recognise publicly that the overall result of ourpolicy will impose a squeeze on local authorities, partly because the RSGwill not in any event be increased in respect of higher prices other than pay,partly because of the need to find at least 39 per cent towards any paysettlements over the original guidelines, so that it may not now be possiblefor them to provide the 2 per cent increase in the volume of local authorityservices which was suggested in the public expenditure White Paper Cmnd 7439.As to the rest of local authority expenditure (current non-pay, andcapital), I see no reason to treat this differently from other non-pay cashlimits.    We should make this clear to the local authorities.4SECRET
SECRETANNOUNCEMENT14. There is advantage in making an announcement to Parliament beforethe devolution recess.    This could be an oral or written statement. Anoral statement might however seem to make too much of it, and I wouldprefer a written answer on Friday 23 February, which would give us alittle more time to settle its precise terms after Thursday&apos;s Cabinet. Adraft is attached at Annex II.CONCLUSIONS15. I invite my colleauges:-i. to agree to the proposal in CP(79) 10 that the non-pay componentof central government and local authority cash limits should be heldto the levels previously planned;ii.    on central government pay, to agree to the modified proposal inparagraph 7 f.   above, subject to the exceptions which I have proposedin paragraph 10;iii. to agree that local authority current expenditure, and the relatedcash limit on the RSG, should be handled as proposed inparagraphs 11 - 13;iv. to agree, as proposed in CP(79) 10, mat nationalised industriesshould stay within the White Paper provision, so far as possiblerecovering any higher costs within 1979-80, through greater oradditional price increases or other measures, and that Departmentsshould now work out the options for doing so on alternative hypothesesabout the outturn for earnings;v.     to approve an announcement by written answer on Friday23 February on the lines of Annex II.J Btreasury Chambers20 February 19795SECRET

SECRETANNEX IIr,PAT?T WRITTEN ANSWER^&quot;To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a state-merit about the Government&apos;s policy concerning cash limits onexpenditure programmes for 1979-80.It is the Governments intention so to set and operate cashlimits for the year ahead that they support counter-inflationpolicies, and in particular support the observance of the Governmentsmonetary targets and a public sector borrowing requirement for1979-80 in line with the projection in the recent White Paperwhich set out the public expenditure plans in volume terms.Central governmentgovern-2, First, in respect of prices, the cash limits for central/ mentexpenditure will be set to provide for the price increasescontemplated when the expenditure planning decisions were takenlast autumn, that is, for price increases consistent with observanceof the pay guidelines in Cmnd 7293.     As shown in the Industry Actforecast published last November, this implied a retail price indexin the fourth quarter of 1979 higher than in the fourth quarter of1978 hy 8  per cent.3. The Government do not intend to raise cash limits to accommodatehigher price increases than this.     Therefore, to the extent thatactual price increases turn out higher, the cash limits will requirethe planned volume of expenditure to be squeezed so as to keepwithin the limits.h.    Second, in respect of pay and manpower, the cash limitsconcerning central government services are being set in accordancewith the policy stated in Cmnd 7293, together with the  3.50underpinning subsequently announced.     Some increase in thisprovision may in due course be unavoidable if eventually pay3eUlements in the current round turn out substantially higherthan the provision made.     The Government will review each suchcase individually.     The general principle will be that if anysuch increase is made, at least the first 2 percentage points of anye*cess over the existing provision will have to be absorbedwithin the existing cash limit.1SECRET
SECRET5. This principle will be applied so far as possible to allcentral government expenditure on manpower.   But in the case ofpay settlements affecting certain special categories of staff -the armed forces, staff in direct support of patients in the hospitand community health services, and non-administrative staff in theprison service -the relevant cash limits will be increased asnecessary to match the actual settlements.Local Authorities6. As regards local authority expenditure, the Government willmaintain the same policy on price increases - that is, the non-payelement in the cash limits on the rate support grant, and thecash: limits on capital expenditure, will not be raised toaccommodate higher price increases than are consistent with theIndustry Act forecast.   Local authorities will need to adjusttheir spending plans to take account of this,7-     Qrr the pay side, several important settlements for localauthority employees have to be negotiated over the next few months,The Governmenfs contribution is again covered by the rate supportgrant, and it is too early to say whether any adjustment to therate support grant cash limit may be justified.   But I must make iclear that should any of these settlements involve additional costbeyond the level already assumed, the Government will in no circumstances contribute more than the standard share of local authoritycurrent expenditure already agreed (that is, 61 per cent for Engla;and Wales), and are not committed to making any contribution to thexcess cost of such settlements.   Whether the Government agree tocontribute, either the full 61 per cent share, /&quot;as in the settlemfor manual workers just announced-7, or at some lesser percentage,will depend on the circumstances of each case.8..     As: a result of this policy, local authorities are likelyto face some reduction in the volume of expenditure for which the,can expect to receive central government finance.   The Governmentrecognise that the authorities may well now find it impossibleto provide the full 2 per cent increase in the volume of theirservices envisaged in the last public expenditure White Paper.2SECRET
SECRETKationaliBed industries9,    For nationalised industries the Governmentf s objective isthat their external financing should remain within the aggregateprovision in the public expenditure White Paper.     The industriesmay need to take appropriate action, including price increaseswhere necessary, in order to achieve this.3SECRET
