CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 7 COPY NO6 February 1979CABINETA NATIONAL HERITAGE FUNDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceand Paymaster General and the Secretary of Statefor the Environment1. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, circulated to the Cabinet lastDecember (under CP(78) 131) a draft White Paper on The National HeritageFund.    The Fund as proposed in the draft White Paper involved, with theagreement of the Chief Secretary, Treasury, a charge on the ContingencyReserve of approximately  10 million in 1979-80 towards the &quot;endowment&quot; ofthe Fund.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, has now suggested that in thelight of the present economic climate the proposal to &quot;endow&quot; the NationalHeritage Fund with  10 million should be withdrawn.    This would leave theFund with an annual grant of  5 million.2. We wish to oppose this suggestion and would draw attention to two mainpoints.3. First there is a question of credibility with the critics of the presentarrangements.    The Parliamentary Sub-Committee proposed endowing aHeritage Fund with  50 million and the Opposition have committed themselvesto this figure &quot;as resources permit&quot;.    To announce a Heritage Fund withoutany endowment would ensure that much of the credit accruing to the Govern- ,ment w*uld be lost in criticism of the lack of resources made available to theFund.    It would also make it extremely difficult to persuade Lord Reigate towithdraw his Private Peer&apos;s Bill from the Lords.Second it is important to remember that there is no immediate call onresources.    Any Bill is likely to take some time to complete its Parliamen-tary progress, and, if necessary, the commencement of the Fund could bedelayed until 1980-81.    Presentationally it would be possible to combine virtuewith necessity and indicate that the Government would have wished to be moregenerous to the new Fund but that under present economic circumstancesS10 million is all that can be made available.S WPS0epartment of Education and Science6 February 1979CONFIDENTIAL
