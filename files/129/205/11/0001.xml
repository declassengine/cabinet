CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79)U15 February 1979COPY NO80CABINETBRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION ROYAL CHARTERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department1. A supplemental Royal Charter for the British BroadcastingCorporation (BBC) is required urgently to raise their borrowing Hmit from 30 million to  100 million.    Their main Charter expires on 31 July 1979.Since we do not now expect to be able to introduce this Session the majorbroadcasting legislation required to implement the proposals in our WhitePaper on Broadcasting, the BBCs Charter will have to be extended to31 December 1981 (the date when the existing legislation governing theIndependent Broadcasting Authority expires).    That will also require asupplemental Charter, together with a new Licence and Agreement. Thispaper suggests that, rather than have two supplemental Charters within aperiod of a few months, it would be preferable to have a single supplementalCharter increasing the borrowing Hmit and extending the life of the BBC.2. The need to raise the BBCs borrowing limit arises as a result of therecent pay award by the Central Arbitration Committee of 16j per cent toBBC staff.    This will mean that the BBC will reach the limit of its borrowingpowers in April instead of November this year, the time until which lastyear1 s increase in the licence fees was intended to last.    The Chancellorand I agreed that it would be undesirable to have further increases in thelicence fees in the next few months and that the best way of dealing with thematter would be to raise the borrowing limits in or before April. Myintention to apply for a supplemental Charter to increase the limits to 100 million was announced on 29 January in a debate on a prayer againstthe recent fee increases.A supplemental Charter does not strictly require Parliamentary time,though pressure for a debate on the raising of the borrowing limit might bedifficult to resist.    But the BBCs Licence and Agreement, which must beextended with the main Charter, is not binding until it has been approved bya Resolution of the House of Commons (House of Commons, Standing Order96).    it has been the normal practice to lay both the draft Charter andtfle Licence and Agreement and to allow debate to cover both.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. It would be preferable not to have two debates on BBC matters in thecoming months and it would be preferable also not to run right up to 31 Julybefore renewing the main Charter.5. I therefore propose to apply for one supplemental Charter which willextend the life of the BBC until 31 December 1981 and will make only theminimum essential amendments to the principal Charter, principally thoseconcerning the increased borrowing powers.    I do not propose to make anychanges to the substance of the Licence and Agreement.6. This procedure will mean that we will not be taking the firstopportunity of implementing our proposals in the White Paper onBroadcasting for the BBCs Service Management Boards and Governmentappointments to the BBCs National Broadcasting Councils.    These proposalshave found no friends either in the Parliamentary or in Press commentimmediately following publication or in subsequent comments to the HomeOffice.   And I have just received the Trades Union Congress&apos;s commentswhich ask the Government to rethink the proposals and consult the unionsinvolved in the BBC.7.       I believe that we should run into severe difficulties in the House ofCommons if we tried to impose Service Management Boards on the BBC atthe present time.    However, the BBC Governors have themselves movedto some degree in the direction we wish.    They have accepted the broadaims of our proposals, ie. that the BBC should retain its independence, thatthe BBC should be more decentralised in its management while maintainingits essential unity and that the Governors should be seen more clearly to becarrying out their public interest role.    They consider that ServiceManagement Boards would not achieve these aims because, they say, theywould undermine the authority of the Governors, confuse the management ofthe Corporation by inserting a new layer of bureaucracy and cast doubt onthe editorial independence of the Corporation.    Stimulated by our proposals,however, the Governors have made important changes in their method ofworking in order to &quot;develop and clarify their public interest role asGovernors and to clarify the diversified nature of the management of theBBC&quot; (see Annex A).    These changes which, because the Charter does notspecify the internal structure of the BBC it is open to the Governors to makethemselves, took effect in January.8-       I propose that, while not abandoning our own proposals, we should letthe alternative arrangements devised by the BBC run until 31 December 1981,reserving the right to introduce our own proposals in a new Charterthereafter if we consider this necessary.    This would also mean that a newCharter would follow, which is the logical order, rather than precede themajor broadcasting Bill which the Lord President considers cannot be takenuntil the next Session.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALI invite my colleagues to agree -a. that I should apply for a single supplemental Charter for theBBC, confined mainly to raising their borrowing limit and extendingthe life of the BBC to 31 December 19PI.b. That in dealing with questions for oral reply on 22 FebruaryI should announce this intention and make it clear that the Governmentis not abandoning its White Paper proposals for the BBC but reservesthe right to introduce them if it thinks it necessary when a newCharter will be required to run from 1 January 1982.M RHome Office15 February 19793CONFIDENTIAL

The Governors intend further to develop regional involvement with theirrk.  The committees for television and radio now meet.on alternate fortnightsId the committee for external services quarterly and consider programme strategy,licy and content.

Directoratenagecent groups already run television, radio and external broadcasting on afiy-to-day basis.It is also the intention of both the Eoard of Governors and of the BoardManagement that the different creative units of the BBC at both national and;Eional levels, shall be given the greatest possible managerial freedom andJsponsibility to get on with the job, with the minimum need to refer to higher^agenent or to the centre.   They intend to maintain the independence of the BBCid to govern and to manage, within        their essential unity, a diverse, creativeultimately accountable staff so that their skills can be used most efficientlyresponsibly to continue to make good programmes.
