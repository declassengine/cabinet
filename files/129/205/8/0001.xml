ISBN 0 10 174580 XFARMING AND THE NATIONINTRODUCTION1. Farming is one of the nation&apos;s leading industries, with a fine record ofsuccess over many years. The efforts of British farmers and farm workers supplyan increasing share of the food we eat from a declining area of farmland andwith fewer people working in the industry. In rural areas agriculture is the basefor much of the local economy and sustains the living landscape, which it hashelped to shape and develop. In the national economic context, agricultureprovides a market and home base for a number of supplying industries andprovides many of the raw materials for the food and drink manufacturingindustries.2. The White Paper &quot;Food from Our Own Resources&quot; set out the resultsof the review of medium-term prospects for British agriculture conducted in1974/75. Four major developments, and a host of minor ones, have affectedagricultural prospects since then. In 1975 the British people voted to continueBritish membership of the European Community: this has meant that UnitedKingdom agricultural policies have had to operate within the framework of thecommon agricultural policy. Developments on the exchange markets and in theCommunity&apos;s agri-monetary policy the so-called &quot;green currencies&quot; havesince 1975 given the Government a much greater degree of control over thesterling prices of agricultural commodities than seemed likely. Throughout theseyears inflation has been the major economic problem facing the country: it hasaffected both farming costs and the Governments approach to food prices.Finally, weather conditions have been more extreme than in any comparableperiod for many decades: in particular the dry summer of 1975 and the unpre-cedented drought of 1976 provided a major setback to agricultural production,both arable and animal.3. It is not therefore surprising that agricultural net product has not increasedsmoothly and steadily. In some commodities notably the most important arablecrop, cereals, and the most important livestock product, milk production hasexpanded since 1974/75 in line with expectations; in some others such aspigmeat it has not. The time has therefore come to review medium-termprospects and to set out the Governments approach to medium-term policy, soas to define where the national interest lies and to afford a firm basis for farmers&apos;own decisions.DEMAND FOR FOOD IN THE UNITED KINGDOM4. An assessment of the role of British agriculture must take as its startingpoint the demand for food in the United Kingdom. This is considered in Annex I.The Governments conclusion is that there is likely to be a modest increase inconsumers&apos; total expenditure on food, in real terms, over the next few years, inpart reflecting a shift towards the purchase of more highly processed foods.Dietary changes, new food sources and new technologies will continue to in-fluence consumption but are not expected to have major effects during this period.The Government will continue their efforts to inform and persuade on the needfor healthy eating. Britain remains a major net importer of temperate foodstuffs,1
and there is therefore considerable scope for expansion to satisfy home demand,as well as the possibility of increased exports of food, feed and drink, whichhave risen rapidly in recent years to over  2,100 million in 1977.AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND THE NATIONAL INTEREST5. Production from home agriculture will continue to provide nearly two-thirds of the food we can grow here and more than half the country&apos;s total foodsupplies. The industry contributes about 2\ per cent of the national income- 3,165 million in 1977 while the 660,000 people employed represent a similarproportion of the working population. With related sectors, including food anddrink processing, the agricultural supply industries, and service industries inrural areas, farming has a much wider significance in terms of employment andnational income. In addition, the prosperity of many rural areas is dependentupon the well-being of agriculture.6. It makes sense to produce in this country foodstuffs in which we arecompetitive. Growth of productivity in agriculture compares favourably withmuch of industry. British agriculture&apos;s efficiency has enabled it in most sectorsto withstand competition from other Community countries which have bene-fitted from the green currency arrangements. Our agriculture has advantagesover its overseas competitors in terms of industrial structure, in some cases ofsoil or climate, and of proximity to the market particularly important forhighly perishable products such as some horticultural crops. The general benefitto the balance of payments to be derived from increasing home production whichcan compete with imports must be taken into account. While North Sea oilwill lead for a time to a marked improvement in the country&apos;s balance of pay-ments, the expansion of efficient home agricultural production can contribute toa significant and continuing long-term benefit.7. The productivity record of our agriculture and its potential for furthergrowth in efficiency provide a sound base on which to promote expansion. Thenecessary investment is already assisted by the Government in a number of ways,including capital grants and taxation policies, but there will need to be furtherinvestment by those engaged in the industry. This will be forthcoming onlyif there are sufficiently stable conditions and sufficient incentives and confidencein the future of the industry. If the country is to continue to benefit from gains inagricultural productivity, therefore, the progressive farmer needs a reasonableassurance that his production will continue to be profitable.8. The case for devoting resources to agricultural expansion rests essentiallyon three factors: the likely price and availability of imports; the argument forgreater self-sufficiency as insurance against unexpected scarcity and high pricesin a world of rapidly growing population; and the likely effect on national in-come and on the efficient allocation of resources of the measures needed toprocure higher agricultural output.9. The prospects for import prices and availability are considered in AnnexII. World prices for the major temperate foodstuffs seem unlikely to rise sharplyin the near future, but the position in the longer term, with the expected con-2tinuing increase in world population and with much of the existing world pop-ulation lacking an adequate food supply, is uncertain. For Britain&apos;s imports ofthese commodities, however, membership of the European Community makesthe situation within the Community more directly relevant. Import prices underCommunity arrangements depend very largely on the rate of exchange at whichcommon Community prices are translated into sterling, and are strongly in-fluenced by the Governmenfs policy towards that rate of exchange. Availabilitydepends on the balance of supply and demand in the Community, where theproblem for several commodities is of surplus rather than shortage. Overall, theGovernmenfs conclusion is that import prospects and the need for insurancecontinue to point to the desirability of increased agricultural output in thiscountry; but not so strongly as to justify seeking the maximum output increase,regardless of the cost to the consumer or to the economy at large, or of itsimpact on the environment. The Governmenfs domestic agricultural policy,especially on prices, cannot be divorced from the Community&apos;s commonagricultural policy. The requirement to work within the mechanisms of the lattermeans that large increases in the resources available to agriculture can be madeonly by increasing the domestic and import prices of temperate foodstuffs.In assessing when and by how much this should be done, the third factor theeffect on national income and on the wealth and standard of living of the nationat large becomes crucial.APPROACH TO THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY AND THEGREEN POUND10. There are two main mechanisms which affect support levels for Comm-unity farmers: the &quot;common&quot; prices which are fixed in units of account andnegotiated each spring by the Council of Ministers; and the &quot;green currency&quot;,or rate of exchange through which these common prices are converted intonational terms. The Governmenfs fundamental aims in continuing to seek toreform the common agricultural policy are to encourage low-cost and discouragehigh-cost production, and to get a better balance between supply and demand.The most effective way to do this is to restrain common price levels, which atpresent currency exchange rates are well above the levels that apply to Britishproducers and are generally much higher than efficient producers require. Thisapplies particularly to the products in structural surplus including milk, sugarand wheat. Lower common prices would benefit Community consumers; reducethe burden which the disposal of surpluses places on Community taxpayers;reduce the threat these surpluses present to world markets; make possible amore liberal approach to imports from third countries; and reduce the sub-stantial net resource cost which the common agricultural policy imposes on oureconomy. The common price increases of the last two years are the lowestsince Britain&apos;s entry. The Government will continue with this approach, whichis in the interests of both this country and the Community as a whole. From theeconomic point of view restraining high-cost Community production is consistentwith expanding low-cost efficient production in the United Kingdom.11. Since increases in common prices are undesirable in the case of manycommodities, the Government have looked to other measures to provide theincentives for agricultural investment and expansion which are in the national3
interest. They have used those measures which remain to some extent withintheir own discretion, including various forms of capital grants and taxationpolicy. The returns to our farmers can also be improved, without increasingcommon prices, through adjustments in the green pound rate.12. A green pound devaluation has a number of short-term economiceffects: an increase in food prices; an increase in farmers&apos; revenue; the raising ofimport prices; and a fall in Community expenditure on monetary compensatoryamounts and therefore a reduction in the overall Community budget and in theBritish contribution to it. Consumers are likely to spend more on food and lesson other goods and services; and this effect is not likely to be fully offset byfarmers&apos; own increased expenditure. These short-term effects are likely to have anet adverse impact on national income.13. Over the course of time, however, farmers are likely to respond byincreasing production, the timing and extent reflecting both the higher pricesand such consequential factors as increased feed costs. With increased productionand some fall in consumption because of higher prices, the volume of UnitedKingdom food imports will fall, probably more than offsetting the initial effectof the increase in import prices and so producing a fall in the total food importbill. Until restraint on common prices curtails surplus production, these changesare likely to produce an additional cost to Community funds, offsetting thesaving on monetary compensatory amounts and therefore the reduction in ourbudgetary contribution. In assessing the net effect of a green pound devaluationon national income, a judgement has to be made on whether the longer-termincrease in production and resulting balance of payments gain outweighs theshort-term adverse effect. Account has also to be taken of the effect of increasedfood prices on inflationary pressures generally.14. The analysis of these factors is complex. In practice other influences,particularly more general economic developments, will affect the outcome. Toolarge a green pound devaluation and certainly moving over a very shortperiod to the maximum extent would reduce national income: it could not berelied upon to call forth a proportionally larger production increase than amoderate devaluation in the same time-scale, and it would have damaginginflationary effects. On the other hand, not to devalue the green pound in anycircumstances would also be wrong; it could seriously damage one of our mostproductive industries and so harm our balance of payments.15. Green currency arrangements will clearly continue to form an importantpart of the common agricultural policy. The Governments conclusion is thatmoderate devaluations, each carefully judged on its merits at the time, can bejustified in terms of the needs of the British economy as a whole, including thefarming industry. The Government will also continue to seek to eliminatedistortions of competitive conditions produced by defects in the detailed opera-tion of the Community arrangements, such as those which have led to marketproblems for pigmeat and to an extent for beef.4mTHE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION16. The scope for expanding agricultural production in the United Kingdomwill continue to be governed by the three major factors of production: labour,land and capital. This scope for expansion and its impact on other aspects ofnational life are considered in detail in Annex III.17. The farm workforce including employees, farmers and their families has contributed in very large measure to agriculture^ notable record of improvedefficiency and productivity. The rate of decline in agricultural manpower hasslowed down and this trend is expected to continue. The Government recognisethe important contribution of education and training to the efficiency of theindustry and will continue to encourage the development of services appropriateto the needs of the farm workforce. Greater skill means more productivity andhigher pay, and the Government look to see both in the years ahead.18. The supply of land is limited, and the agricultural area declining. TheGovernment intend to pursue vigorously their policy of protecting agriculturalland, particularly land of better quality, and will improve their informationon the quantity and quality of land going out of agricultural use. They re-cognise the claims of amenity and conservation and will take due account of theneed to strike a balance between these and farming. They will maintain assistanceto farmers in hill and upland areas. They will consider with care the findings ofthe Northfield Committee&apos;s inquiry into the acquisition and occupancy ofagricultural land.19. Agricultural expansion requires capital investment. The best incentiveto investment is confidence in future stability and profitability, and this WhitePaper is intended to promote such confidence. The Government propose tomaintain grant aids to capital investment. They have taken a number of fiscalmeasures to assist agriculture: the averaging of income for tax purposes; theimproved capital investment allowance for buildings; the continued de-rating ofagricultural land; the indefinite continuation of arrangements for stock relief;the 50 per cent relief from capital transfer tax for the working farmer&apos;sbusiness assets; and the deferment of capital gains tax on gifts of businessassets.20. Among other factors of production, energy represents a substantialproportion of the industry&apos;s production and distribution costs. The Governmenthave already announced a major programme of expenditure to promote themore efficient use of energy, which has implications for agriculture, and willconduct research into less energy-intensive farming systems. No supply con-straints appear likely in the medium term for fertilisers and agro-chemicals; theGovernment will continue to maintain safeguards for the latter&apos;s proper use.The Government intend to review agriculture^ future requirements of water.No constraints are expected on the availability of modern and efficient farmmachinery, and the Government look to British manufacturers to supply thelargest possible proportion of the industry&apos;s needs.5
Ill21. The rapid growth of productivity in British agriculture owes a very greatdeal to research, development and advice, the bulk of which is undertaken bythe Government. The Government will continue to sponsor long-term research,and look for benefit within the next five years from new ideas which are alreadyin the course of development and application on a commercial scale. The speedyadoption of new technology, which the advisory services have a key role inadvancing, will remain the cornerstone of the competitiveness of British farming.There is good reason to believe that the long-term increase in productivity whichwas checked primarily by the bad weather of the mid-seventies has been resumed.MARKETING AND PROCESSING22. Increased production cannot be an end in itself but must meet the needsof the market. The Government place great emphasis on achieving the objectivesof the Industrial Strategy in the food and drink manufacturing industries; andthere would be a clear gain to the national wealth if those industries could relyupon a higher proportion of competitively produced raw materials from homesources.23. The Government attach considerable importance to the efficientmarketing of agricultural produce, and the successful negotiation of Communityarrangements to maintain the Milk Marketing Boards is evidence of this. Inmany sectors, however, British producers are to an increasing degree competingwith overseas suppliers whose marketing skills are highly developed, and someshortcomings in our own marketing techniques and structures have becomeapparent. The solution in many cases is not easy to find. The Government aretherefore setting up a Committee of Inquiry to consider how the marketing ofagricultural produce might be improved. These issues are considered in moredetail in Annex IV.A SCOPE FOR EXPANSION24. In the light of the policies and assessments set out in this White Paper,and after full consultation with all the interests concerned, the Government haveconcluded that a sustained increase in agricultural net product is in the nationalinterest and can be achieved, without undue impact on the environment.Increased productivity should be the major means of securing growth in output,and the Government will frame their policies so as to afford the framework ofstability and confidence in which this can take place, while paying due regard tothe claims of conservation and other uses of the countryside. It is not possibleto predict with certainty the precise scale or pattern of the production increase;this will depend on technical improvements, the relative prices and profitabilityof the various commodities, the weather and many other variables. However, afull study, made on alternative price assumptions, and based on the averageactual results for 1977 and provisional results for 1978, suggests that the netproduct of British agriculture in five years&apos; time might be some 10 to 20 percent higher in real terms. The prospects for particular commodities are set outin Annex V.6CONCLUSION25. This White Paper sets out no precise targets, for in the agricultural contextthese have little meaning. Rather it is a statement of intent and of determination:of the Government^ settled conclusion that the continued expansion of agri-cultural net product over the medium-term is in the national interest; and oftheir determination so to frame their policies as to enable a progressive andefficient industry to make an ever-increasing contribution to the well-being ofthe nation.7
ANNEX IDEMAND FOR FOOD IN THE UNITED KINGDOM1. The Governments review began by considering the possible demand forfood over the next five years or so. Past trends are shown in Table 1.1. Futuredemand will depend on a combination of such factors as changes in populationand the distribution between age groups, alterations in income and the propor-tion of it spent on food, and trends in consumer tastes.Population2. The population is projected to decrease by about \ per cent over the nextfive years. Within this total, the number of adults is projected to rise by 3 percent and the number of children under the age of fifteen to fall by 13 per cent.The reduction in total population is not expected to result in any significantvariation in the overall demand for food, though the change in age structurecould modify the consumption of certain foods. While the fall in the number ofchildren could reduce demand for some items, in general consumption of moststaple foods is projected to rise slightly as a result of the variations amongst agegroups.Incomes and Expenditure on Food3. Projected increases in real incomes over the next five years and trends indemand are estimated to lead to an increase in consumers&apos; total expenditure onfood at 1977 prices of just over 1^ per cent. The slight downward trend in theenergy content of the diet (Table 1.2) is expected to continue, consistent with asmall reduction in levels of physical activity. An important element in the pro-jected increase in expenditure on food is a quality change to higher valued foods,due in some cases to a greater degree of processing.Changes in Earing Habits4. One factor which could affect the pattern of demand for food is theincreasing awareness of the effect on health of the choice of foods. The Govern-ment welcome this. Some argue on health grounds that the Government shouldbe directly involved in seeking to modify diet. This the Government already dowhere there are clear and specific health risks; but they believe that it is otherwisenot their function to impose changes of diet. Instead they see their role as aneducational one, seeking to inform and persuade on the need for healthy eating.In particular, the recent publication by the Health Departments &quot;Eating forHealth&quot; (!) will play a part in this process. But any alterations in eating patternsare likely to take place slowly, and are therefore not expected to have a markedeffect on the pattern of demand for food over the next five years.(0 DHSS London 19788Technological Change5. Continued advance is likely in the development of new food sources and inthe development and application of new agricultural and processing technologyand skills. The Governments assessment is, however, that these changes are notliable to exercise a major influence on the pattern of demand for food over thenext five years.Consumption of Individual Foods6. The overall effect of these factors is expected to be an increase in demandfor beef, pork and poultrymeat, fruit and vegetables, and both alcoholic andnon-alcoholic drinks. Consumption of sugar and sugar-based products, cereal-based foods, mutton and lamb and oils and fats is expected to decrease. Overallconsumption of liquid milk and milk products is not expected to alter1 significan-tly, although there may be some changes within this group as a whole. Anassessment of the nutritional implications indicates a broadly stable totalprotein intake and a small reduction in intake of carbohydrates.Food Supplies Moving into Consumption in the United KingdomTable 1.1: Quantities (kg) per head per year	1955	1965	1970	1976	1977Liquid milk (litres)	143-6	141-7	137-2	140-4	135-4Cheese	4-1	4-6	5-4	61	5-5Beef and veal	21-5	20-8	22-2	21-1	21-1Mutton and lamb	111	10-5	9-6	7-6	7-0Pork	8-1	11-7	11-1	10-2	11-5Bacon and ham	11-2	11-7	11-4	8-5	8-9Poultry	2-9	7-6	10-7	11-5	11-4Fish	9-7	9-4	8-9	8-4	7-4Eggs (numbers)	229	271	275	248	248Butter	6-7	8-8	8-8	8-3	7-8Margarine	8-0	4-4	50	5-4	5-4Sugar	46-2	45-4	44-0	38-9	38-6Fruit	51-3	55-4	56-6	56-2	52-9Potatoes	106-2	100-9	103-5	85-0	96-6Other vegetables	55-2	60-9	630	65-9	65-6Wheat flour	82-8	70-3	66-2	66-2	65-3Tea	4-2	41	3-9	3-6	3-2Coffee	0-6	1-3	2-0	2-1	1-7Beer (litres)	79-7	91-4	101-5	118-9	117-8Wine (litres)	1-5	2-9	3-8	6-7	6-4Spirits (proof litres)	10	1-4	1-6	2-9	2-59

The United Kingdom market for food has to be considered in both aworld and a European Community context. We import almost half our totalfood requirements, including one-third of our temperate foodstuffs, and importswill continue to make an important contribution to our food supplies.2. For many foods the predominant factor is our membership of the EuropeanCommunity. Half our imports of temperate foodstuffs now come from the restof the Community (Table II. 1) and this proportion is likely to increase further inview of the prospective enlargement of the Community to include Greece,Portugal and Spain (Table II.2). The operation of the common agriculturalpolicy assures ready access to supplies in other Member States, as well asproviding access to markets in the rest of the Community for our own agriculturaland food exports. The level of Community prices and its system of managedmarkets mean that, generally speaking, our food imports cost more than theywould if we were not a member, but this and the high self-sufficiency of theCommunity in temperate products (Table II.3) affords some insulation from anymarked increases in world prices.3. Although our ability and need to import food from world markets aretherefore influenced by our membership of the European Community, conditionson these markets continue to be relevant. This is because we still import signifi-cant quantities from third countries, and because world market prices are animportant consideration in determining our approach towards Communitypolicies. It is however hard to identify true &quot;world&quot; prices for individual comm-odities. A comparatively small proportion of the total production of the majortemperate foodstuffs enters into world trade, and an even smaller proportion isavailable outside special contracts and at quoted world prices. Relatively smallchanges in total world production or demand can therefore make a big differenceto supplies available to importing countries and to world price levels.4. World stocks of the main temperate foodstuffs are higher now than theyhave been in the past decade. This suggests that substantial price rises seem un-likely in the near future. In the longer term, prospects are inevitably uncertain.Much will depend upon the growth in the effective world demand for food andthe extent to which the potential for increased production is realised. The workTspopulation is growing at a rate of nearly 2 per cent a year, and will double in lessthan forty years. The problem of feeding this increased population must givecause for concern.5. The overall world picture conceals a marked contrast between developedand developing countries. In the developing countries there are far too manypeople who cannot afford adequate diets, so the volume of potential demand inthese countries could well, if it were to become effective, outstrip increases inproduction. Moreover, developing countries tend to be in areas where weatherinstability is particularly liable to affect agricultural output; and they may some-times have difficulty in devoting the necessary resources to the expansion of then-food production.11
6. The Government consider that a long-term aim of international food andagricultural policy should be to help developing countries to feed themselvesbetter. Through our aid policies we support the efforts of developing countries toimprove their agricultural output. Even if this does not enable them to becomeself-sufficient in some foods, it can assist their export earnings and increase theircapacity to import such food as they cannot grow themselves. This approachalso distributes the benefits of development more widely among the greatmajority of the people in the Third World who live in rural areas. Food aid isappropriate to meet unpredictable emergencies and natural disasters. It can alsobe a useful selective tool designed to supplement commercial imports by thepoorest nations and to stimulate local development and economic activity so as toimprove their future ability to import food or produce their own. But it is notan end in itself.7. In the developed countries, on the other hand, increases in real income havelittle effect on the level of demand for food, and production is capable of ex-panding much faster than demand. Indeed, the present combination of highstocks and relatively low prices on world markets may lead to cutbacks inproduction by developed countries; currently, for instance, the United States isfollowing a policy of setting land aside from cereal production. Such measuresneed to be accompanied by effective reserve stock arrangements to provideagainst the possibility of bad harvests. Negotiations on a new international grainsagreement with reserve stock provisions are an important element in internationalplanning for world food security.8. There is a real argument for the United Kingdom, which is dependent onimports for an unusually large proportion of our food, to reduce the risk offluctuations in food imports and prices and to maintain the security of some ofour basic food supplies by increasing the proportion produced at home. Such apolicy must, however, be pursued in a manner that is responsible. Developedcountries should bear in mind the implications of an expansion of productionbased on commodities which are essential to developing countries. In particular,grain is the staple food of the undernourished, and if increased imports of grainfor livestock production make it scarcer or more expensive for them, such importsshould where possible be avoided. The major developed countries should alsoleave markets available for those countries which depend on food exports fortheir foreign exchange earnings.9. The stability of world commodity markets is a matter of importance toboth developed and developing countries, and the Government have played anactive part in efforts to negotiate international commodity agreements whichwould permit world trade to expand on a more stable basis. For this reason toothe Government continue to emphasise the need to maintain and improve accessinto the European Community of imports from efficient third country producersand from developing countries whose economic development requires marketopportunities in Europe. They are also seeking to ensure that the operation of thecommon agricultural policy takes increasing account of the need to avoiddisruption of other markets. These aims have been pursued in the current roundof GATT multilateral trade negotiations (MTNs) and in the negotiations on anew international grains agreement. The declared object of the MTNs is the12liberalisation of international trade and during the negotiations the Governmenthave sought to encourage greater liberalisation of trade in food and agriculturalproducts. The Government have also supported the Community&apos;s efforts tonegotiate international agreements on beef and dairy products as part of theMTNs. Similarly they have supported the negotiation of a new internationalsugar agreement, and hope that the Community will be able to agree quickly toits accession to the Agreement on appropriate terms.Table II.1: Value of United Kingdom Imports of Food, Feed and Drink  million (cif)	1972	1973	1976	1977Live animals	72	80	84	98Meat and meat preparations	540	716	838	974Dairy products and eggs	255	225	505	460Fish and fish preparations	96	132	191	210Cereals and cereal preparations	257	370	747	820Fruit and vegetables	429	561	942	1,108Sugar and sugar preparations	146	175	429	428Coffee, tea and cocoa	187	249	493	919Animal feedingstuffs	84	154	173	210Miscellaneous food and agricultural	i nn			preparations		314	562	799TOTAL FOOD AND FEED	2,265	2,976	4,964	6,026of which       European Community	690	1,031	2,167	2,442Third Countries	1,575	1,945	2,797	3,584DRINK	134	230	251	306of which       European Community	99	168	184	226Third Countries	35	62	67	80INDEX (1972=100)				FOOD:- Volume	100	98	97	97Value	100	129	214	256Unit Value	100	133	220	267DRINK:- Volume	100	137	127	129Value	100	172	188	229Unit Value	100	127	168	19013

ANNEX HITHE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION1. The Governments assessment of the scope for agricultural expansion tookinto consideration the availability of the necessary resources, not only of thefundamental factors of production labour, land and capital but also of suchinputs as energy, fertilisers, water, and machinery. Account was also taken ofthe need to safeguard the environment and of the contribution to improvingproductivity made by research, development and advice. In a number of theseareas there is much valuable material in the series of reports by the AgricultureEconomic Development Committee entitled &quot;Agriculture into the ^SOs&quot;^).Labour2. The farm workforce consists not only of employees but also of farmers andtheir families, who provide the biggest single labour input. Over 50 per cent offood production comes from the largest 13 per cent of farm businesses and thesefarms continue to rely substantially upon permanent full-time employees. Theseare supplemented by considerable numbers of part-time, seasonal or casualworkers, especially at harvest; by the resources of agricultural contractorsoffering services ranging from routine cultivations or relief milking to aerialspraying and specialised field drainage works; and by students, apprentices andother recruits performing farm work primarily to gain skills and experience.3. The rate of decline in the agricultural labour force is slackening. From5-6 per cent a year in the 1960s the rate for full-time workers has fallen to justover 3-J per cent a year in the last two years. This slower outflow and the trendto increasing labour productivity are expected to continue. The availability ofmanpower to the industry should not therefore be a major constraint through tothe 1980s, although local variations may occur because of particular localconditions.4. The Government are keen to enhance the efficiency of the agriculturallabour force as a whole, which should enjoy facilities and incentives commen-surate with the industry&apos;s importance in the national economy. If the industry&apos;sworkforce is to sustain its impressive and progressive record of higher producti-vity and to continue to respond effectively to the challenge of new technology, therelevant education and training facilities will need to be updated regularly toprovide the necessary specialist skills. On the training side the AgriculturalTraining Board&apos;s five-year rolling plans are the natural basis for this. TheGovernment share the Board&apos;s view that priority should be given to improvingor renewing craft skills wherever necessary among farmers and their families aswell as farmworkers, and to imparting these skills to new entrants. For the cominggeneration the Government place much importance upon the successful de-velopment and expansion of the Board&apos;s Craft Skills Training Scheme. On theeducation side, the Government hope that there will be early agreement on theintroduction in England and Wales of a unified system for the validation offurther education courses at craft level. In Scotland the responsibility for thisfunction will be undertaken by the Scottish Technical Education Council.(i) NEDO London 1977165. Greater use of the training facilities available can bring an improvement inindividual farmworkers&apos; minimum wage rates. The Government are concernedthat only a small number of farmworkers less than one-third of regular full-time hired employees have yet been registered as craftsmen and becomestatutorily entitled to higher minimum rates prescribed under the AgriculturalWages Board&apos;s Wage Structure Scheme. The Government are encouraging moreto become craftsmen by financing the entire budget of the Agricultural TrainingBoard, much of which is for investment in the craft skills that qualify for premiumrates, and by defraying all the central expenses of the National ProficiencyTests Council for England and Wales to validate achievement of those skills.There is now an onus upon farmers and farmworkers alike to ensure that fulladvantage is taken of these opportunities.6. Management is the other priority area in agricultural education and train-ing. Management includes both farm business management and man management.The former takes in such matters as the choice and balance of enterprises,investment policy, financial planning and marketing practice all of whichrequire experience in the industry as well as a sound educational base. Manmanagement is concerned with effective supervision and good industrial relations.All concerned in agriculture, whether employers, managers or workers, have beenaffected by developments in general social legislation. Farming also presents itsown particular problems in the supervisory aspects of man management. Thesestem largely from the cyclical nature of food production which can involve, forexample, a seasonal influx of temporary and often untrained workers. Moregenerally, there is less scope for the settled routine or the kind of supervisioncommonly possible in factories and offices.7. The Government have invited the Agricultural Training Board to under-take a special review of its provisions for man management training, and toconsider whether any new measures may be required. The Department ofEducation and Science is at present reviewing the provision made by the furthereducation service for management education in England and Wales both inrelation to initial courses and to the needs of experienced farmers and farmmanagers, in the light of technological and economic trends and the availabilityof farm management advice.8. The Government have extended to full-time farmworkers in England andWales and their dependents the kind of housing security enjoyed by workerswhose accommodation does not go with their jobs. From their joint work onAgricultural Dwelling-House Advisory Committees, and housing authorities&apos;early and positive response to those Committees&apos; recommendations, both sidesof the industry have evidence that the new legislation is working to their mutualinterest. For the farmworker this means assurance of a roof over his family&apos;shead; for the farmer it means continued use of farm cottages that are essential tohis business without expensive recourse to the Courts. The Government believethat this reform is helping to strengthen industrial relations in agriculture andenhance the industry&apos;s ability to meet the challenge of the 1980s. So far as Scotlandis concerned the Government are determined to abolish the insecurity inherent inthe agricultural tied cottage system and they are examining the special factors17
fapplying in Scotland. They are considering tied accommodation not only in thelight of the successful measures already introduced in England and Wales butalso in the context of Scottish housing policies as a whole. In the meantimeadministrative arrangements have been made through the Convention ofScottish Local Authorities to encourage district councils to give favourableconsideration to the rehousing of agricultural workers as the need arises.9. The Government are also concerned to improve the standards of safety onthe farm in the interests both of those who work there and of others, especiallychildren, who may live on or visit the farm. This is a matter of particularimportance because of the ever-increasing complexity of modern machinery,buildings, equipment and materials in use on the farm.Land10. The total area of agricultural land in the United Kingdom is about 19million hectares. Between 1971 and 1978 the average recorded loss of land fromagriculture was about 50,000 hectares a year. About half, mainly of poorerquality and in Scotland, was transferred to forestry and woodland. The re-mainder went to urban, industrial, highway and recreational uses and otherpurposes. Better quality land, because it is usually fairly flat and well-drained,often tends to be lost to this kind of development. There is, however, uncertaintyabout the area and quality of the land that has been transferred to urban use andaction is being taken to obtain better information about land going out ofagricultural use.11. Improvements in agricultural productivity cannot be relied on in-definitely to offset the lost output from irreversible losses of agricultural land todevelopment. It must cause concern that the overall loss of agricultural land iscontinuing at a high level. There is some scope for the reclamation of land andfor the use of vacant urban land, but these are likely to make only a limitedcontribution to future land requirements. The Government intend to pursuevigorously their policy of protecting agricultural land, especially that of betterquality, and to bring into use wherever possible derelict and disused urban land.Authorities acquiring agricultural land under the Community Land Schememust have regard to the needs of agriculture and forestry and have already beenadvised to make arrangements for the continued farming of the land until it isactually required for development. The Government hope that all concerned withagricultural land awaiting development, particularly land in the urban fringe,will make similar arrangements. It is desirable that land which is earmarked fordevelopment, but which is unlikely to be developed until more than seven yearshave elapsed, should be kept in full agricultural production on normal agri-cultural tenancies. Statutory consent for short-term letting and licensing ofagricultural land in Great Britain, which afford the tenant a lesser degree ofprotection than a full tenancy, will therefore continue to be exercised sparingly.12. In the light of concerns expressed about the purchase of land by in-stitutions and overseas buyers, farm structure and the difficulties facing youngpeople who wish to enter farming, Agricultural Ministers appointed a Committeeof Inquiry into the Acquisition and Occupancy of Agricultural Land. ThatCommittee, under the chairmanship of Lord Northfield, is expected to reportshortly and the Government will consider its conclusions carefully.1813. The primary purpose of our agricultural land continues to be the pro-duction of food, but it is also a source of recreation and interest for a pre-dominantly urban and increasingly mobile population. Throughout history thecountryside has been altering as a result of developments in farming techniques.The landscape which people are understandably keen to preserve would quicklydeteriorate without a flourishing agriculture. But the farming industry needs tobear in mind that many people dislike some of the changes implicit in recentfarming developments. A balance therefore has to be struck. The Governmentwill continue to give a high priority to conserving the natural beauty and amenityof the countryside while equally having regard to the needs of agriculture andforestry and to the economic and social interests of rural areas. The Governmentwelcome the joint initiatives by farmers, landowners and conservationists inrecommending practical measures to care for the countryside and to minimiselosses in familiar landscapes and the variety of wildlife. The Government willthemselves continue to promote research and advice devoted to finding newmeasures and improving existing techniques to reconcile the needs of agriculturaldevelopment and the environment. There is, however, still room for a closer under-standing of the needs of agricultural production by those concerned with planningand conservation, and a closer understanding by landowners and farmers of thegeneral public interest in conservation and recreation in the countryside; andwith this aim in mind the Government are considering whether the AgriculturalDepartments should be more closely involved in countryside affairs and in landuse planning at local levels.14. The constraints on farming are most obvious in the areas around towns;but it is the demand for access for recreation, especially in the National Parks,the Scottish National Park Direction Areas and other designated areas such asAreas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, that generates the most controversy. TheGovernment have initiated studies of the ways by which the physical and socialenvironment of the areas can be reconciled with economic agricultural produc-tion, notably the studies by the Countryside Review Committee^) and theAdvisory Council for Agriculture and Horticulture in England and Wales(2),and they have supported various upland and other management experimentsinitiated by the Countryside Commission.15. The Government recognise that in certain special cases the requirementsof agricultural production must take second place. For example, the mainrecommendations of Lord Porchester&apos;s Study on Exmoor have been accepted bythe Government, including the objective of securing in the national interest theconservation and management of defined areas of moor and heath of excep-tional value within the Exmoor National Park. More generally, in consideringany application for a grant for capital equipment or land improvement theAgricultural Ministers in Great Britain are bound by the Countryside Acts tohave regard to the desirability of conserving the natural beauty and amenity ofthe countryside. As a result a number of schemes have been modified and somegrant applications have been refused. Similarly, while land drainage is recognisedas an important means of increasing the productivity of agricultural land andproviding protection from flooding, water authorities and Ministers are obligedunder the Water Act 1973 to take into account any effect which drainageproposals would have oh the environment and conservation.(1) &quot;Food Production in the Countryside&quot; HMSO London 1978(2) &quot;Agriculture and the Countryside&quot; ACAH London 197819
416. One of the potential problems of particular concern brought about by thecombination of agricultural development and increasing pressure on the country-side is the risk of environmental pollution. In some instances agriculture may beresponsible for pollution while in others agriculture is itself subject to pollutionfrom other sources. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution hastherefore decided to conduct an inquiry into agriculture and pollution generally.Its conclusions are expected to be available shortly.17. About a third of the agricultural area of the United Kingdom consists ofpoor land whose nature strictly limits what it can produce. Through skilledfarming, this land nevertheless makes a valuable contribution to our food supplies.In the hills and uplands, extensive tracts of land are basically suitable only asrough grazings for keeping sheep and, on the kinder slopes, sheep and cattle.These hill and upland areas provide 20 to 25 per cent of our cattle and nearlyhalf of our sheep output. The sheep flock and, to a lesser extent, the beef herd inthe hills also play a fundamental part in the cycle of renewing the nationalbreeding flock and the production of store animals. Since farmers on moreversatile land can normally achieve greater productivity in other enterprises therewould be a misuse of resources if more of the specialist beef herds and ewe flockshad to be kept in the lowlands instead of in the hills and uplands. Moreover, useof the hills and uplands for grazing converts otherwise unusable feed into high-value products.18. Additional output can be obtained from hill and upland farms by con-tinued adoption of up-to-date systems of husbandry. The technical means existfor an increase in the contribution to the economy from the hills and uplands,and for an improvement in the incomes and viability of hill farmers. But in theabsence of special aid the rewards for investment are not always sufficient tostimulate and finance the necessary improvements. In order therefore to maintainand encourage production from the hills and uplands various forms of assistancehave been provided. Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances supplementfarmers&apos; incomes and help to compensate for the disadvantages of farming inless-favoured areas. In addition, the higher rates of capital grant available inthese areas under the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme and the FarmCapital Grant Scheme provide extra cash for investment and help hill farmers toraise their efficiency and improve their earnings.19. There is continuing competition for hill land for forestry development.However, release of land for planting trees does not necessarily result in reducedstocking of cattle and sheep if improved management is possible on the remainingground. Both state and private planting are now subject to prior consultationon the agricultural aspects of the proposed afforestation. Substantial publicbenefits can often be obtained through the integrated development of forestryand recreation facilities alongside farming. The Government will continue toencourage development of this kind in suitable areas.20. Improvement of hill and upland farming cannot leave the environmententirely unchanged. Increased agricultural productivity is accompanied byprogressive domestication of a wild landscape and natural habitats, althoughthis is naturally limited by physical handicaps of climate, soils, steep slopes, and20height above sea level. These areas are however among the most scenic of theUnited Kingdom, and contain most of our National Parks and the areas identifiedby the Countryside Commission for Scotland in their Report on &quot;Scotland&apos;sScenic Heritage&quot;. But the alternative to an increase in agricultural incomes wouldbe the departure of farmers from these areas. In that event some hill and uplandareas would return to relatively unproductive and unattractive forms of vege-tation.21. Despite apparent conflict, there is a common bond of interest betweenthose engaged in the production of food and those whose first priority is theamenity value of the hills. It is farming, and the other employment generated byfarming, which keeps rural communities in being and ensures that basic servicesare there for the many people who enjoy visiting these scenic areas. The EuropeanCommunity&apos;s Directive on Less Favoured Areas, under which compensatoryallowances and higher rates of capital grant are paid to hill farmers, is in factdesigned to provide for the maintenance of rural populations and conservation ofthe countryside in these remote areas through the continuation of agriculturethere.22. Land with similar but less serious limitations of capacity is found atlower elevations and in pockets of varying size throughout the country. Thismarginal land, extending to some one million hectares, is most commonly usedfor livestock rearing or for dairying, supported by bought-in feed. It is estimatedthat this land accounts for some 5 to 10 per cent of production of beef, muttonand lamb, and for 10 per cent of the national dairy herd. The AgriculturalDepartments are studying the special problems of these marginal land areas.Capital23. Up to three-quarters of the industry&apos;s investment funds are generatedfrom farm incomes, with other capital brought in by farmers themselves makinga further significant contribution. In recent years external finance from thebanks, other credit institutions and private sources has represented 10-15 percent of the industry&apos;s total funds. Given reasonable profitability, these sources offinance are expected to go on meeting agriculture&apos;s needs. The Government willcontinue to support outside sources of loan capital. They will ensure that theagricultural industry will, in common with other industrial borrowers andexporters, retain priority in bank lending. Government loan facilities for par-ticular sectors of the industry will also be maintained.24. Government grants play an important role in encouraging fixed capitalinvestment in key areas. Although there are arguments about the relative meritsof capital grants and subsidised interest loans, there is a wide measure ofagreement that the existing grant arrangements in the United Kingdom shouldnot be disturbed in favour of the system of interest subsidies used in some othercountries. Like other businessmen, farmers can in any case benefit from taxrelief on business borrowing, which reduces the cost of interest by a third ormore.21
425. Agricultural taxation is an important factor in farm investment andoutput, and the Governmenfs taxation measures complement the other elementsin their policy for the industry. In particular they have had regard to the needfor the industry to generate financial resources for investment, so as to encourageeconomic and efficient production.26. The Governmenfs fiscal measures to encourage farm investment cover awide area and extend specific additional assistance to farmers. They havedecided that agricultural land and buildings should continue to be free of rates.Because the volatile nature of farming incomes can affect long-term investmentdecisions in the industry, the Government have introduced arrangements wherebyfarmers can average their incomes when their profits change substantially fromyear to year. An additional encouragement to invest in farm buildings and workshas been provided by a substantial increase in the write-off allowed in the firstyear of the agricultural buildings allowance. The Government have announcedthat the temporary arrangements for stock relief will continue indefinitely andthat action is to be taken to limit the build-up of deferred tax liabilities.27. These revenue tax measures have been paralleled by substantial improve-ments in the capital tax reliefs available to farmers. The working farmer can nowvalue all his land and business assets for capital transfer tax purposes at halftheir market value. Farmers who want to pass their holdings on within the familyhave been helped by the deferment of capital gains tax on gifts of assets used in abusiness or of shares in family companies until the assets are sold and notreplaced. Whether they pass their business on or sell it, farmers also benefitfrom improved retirement relief which now exempts gains up to  50,000 at age65.28. These measures, taken together, represent a significant contribution tothe ability of the industry to plan ahead with confidence and to make effectiveuse of their investment resources.Other inputsEnergy29. Though the proportion of the country&apos;s energy consumed by agricultureis small, energy represents a substantial proportion of the production anddistribution costs of the industry. In its most obvious and direct form it is usedas fuel and power. More indirect uses are in the form of other energy-dependentinputs such as fertilisers, agrochemicals and feedingstuffs as well as in the man-ufacture of machinery and the construction of farm buildings. While energysupply constraints are not expected in the immediate future, energy prices as awhole will continue to be related to the world price of oil which is expected atleast to double in real terms by the end of the century. This prospect makes itincreasingly important that energy should be used more efficiently in all sectorsof the economy. The agricultural industry can make a significant contribution tothis for example, by using more energy-efficient machinery on the land and fordrying and processing crops, and by adopting energy-conserving practices inheated glasshouses.2230. The industry has already made useful progress in energy-saving,1 butthere is still considerable scope for further improvement. The Government haveannounced, as part of their overall campaign to promote the saving of energy inall sectors of the economy, a substantial programme of expenditure, includingthe Department of Industry&apos;s Energy Conservation Scheme which covers theagricultural and food industries. The efficient use of energy will continue toform an important element in the Governmenfs programmes of research,development and advice for the farming industry. Longer-term research will alsoconsider the possibility of less energy-intensive farming systems.Fertilisers and Agrochemicals31. The demand for fertilisers, particularly nitrogenous fertilisers, willprobably continue to increase, largely because increased usage on grassland willmake a major contribution to productivity. The United Kingdom is likely toremain a net importer of both nitrogenous fertilisers and ammonia. By theearly 1980s, the United Kingdom is likely to approach self-sufficiency in potash,and more than adequate supplies of phosphate are expected to be available onworld markets. The application of lime is necessary on most land to maintainsoil fertility, and every opportunity is taken to remind farmers to carry out anappropriate liming programme. The return in improved yields, in relation to thecost of liming, should be sufficient encouragement to apply lime where it isappropriate to do so. Grant aid for the application of fertilisers and lime remainsavailable where it is part of a capital improvement, through the Farm andHorticulture Development Scheme and the Farm Capital Grant Scheme, withhigher rates for hill land.32. Agrochemicals will continue to provide an essential contribution bothto productivity and to the quality of the food produced. No supply constraintsappear likely in the medium-term. With the large-scale use of chemicals on farms,however, there is a need to safeguard the environment, drinking water supplies,the farmworker, and the consumer of the food produced, while avoiding anyunnecessary constraints on agricultural output. A sensible balance is currentlymaintained through the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme; and the Govern-ment have welcomed initiatives, developed within the industry and trade, toensure that its provisions are fully understood and applied by manufacturers,distributors and users.Water33. The drought of 1976 dramatically drew attention to the limitations im-posed on agricultural output by inadequate water supplies. As a result, theGovernment introduced special short-term measures in October 1976 to giveextra assistance to farmers for the construction of farm reservoirs. The limitationscan arise even in average years, and more research is needed on this subject. Thereis a clear need to take account of the water requirements of the agriculturalindustry in the preparation of a national strategy for water, which is one of themain functions of the proposed National Water Authority. In the light of this,the Advisory Council for Agriculture and Horticulture, in association with theNational Water Council, has been asked to consider and advise on the futureneeds of agriculture in England and Wales for water and the measures necessaryto promote its efficient use.23
4Machinery34. If farmers are to improve their efficiency and productivity they will needto invest in the machinery required to operate most effectively, and researchand development will include work on evolving and adapting machinery forimproved production techniques. No constraints on the availability of modernand efficient agricultural machinery are expected over the immediate future. Inaccordance with the aims of the Governments Industrial Strategy it is desirablethat as much as possible of the machinery required should be available fromBritish machinery makers, and it is hoped that the industry will respond to theopportunities for the development and introduction of new and improvedmachinery.Research, Development and Advice35. The rapid growth in productivity of British agriculture is due in no smallmeasure to the fruits of research, development and advice. Since the farmingindustry is a fragmented one, the bulk of this research, development and adviceis undertaken by the Government through the Agricultural Research Counciland the advisory services. In the Joint Consultative Organisation for Research andDevelopment, representatives of agriculture and its associated industries, theresearch organisations, the advisory services and the commodity interests worktogether to determine which are potentially the most economically worthwhileareas in which research and development should be concentrated. Prioritieshave been established for all the main areas of agricultural production and app-ropriate programmes of work commissioned. The Scottish Agricultural Develop-ment Council also provides valuable advice on the research and developmentneeds of the industry in Scotland, while in Northern Ireland the Department ofAgriculture is directly responsible for agricultural research, education andadvisory work.36. While attention is focussed on the most pressing needs, progress in thelonger-term requires a continuation of more fundamental work. We are seekingto increase our understanding of some of the basic processes of animal andplant life and in some of these fields British scientists are acknowledged asleaders. Benefits may be expected within the next five years from new ideas andpractices which are already being developed and applied on a commercialscale, but because there is an inevitable time-lag between research findings andtheir application in practice, the effect of longer-term research on farm productionlies further in the future.37. Steps have been taken to shorten the time-lag in the transmission of newtechniques, and to provide farmers more quickly with reliable and well-basedinformation on new developments. A major contribution will continue to be madeby the advisory services in testing and developing the findings from researchprogrammes and in demonstrating to farmers how best the new technology canbe used. The Agricultural Departments&apos; facilities such as the ExperimentalHusbandry Farms and Horticulture Stations play a valuable role in this, and thenew concept of Development Farms will enable the value of improved systems tobe proved and demonstrated under commercial conditions.2438. The food processing industry is able to undertake for itself much of thenecessary research and development. Nevertheless, there is also a role for theGovernment. More than 75 per cent of all the nation&apos;s food is processed in someway and there is a national interest in the efficient use of the resources involved inthe processing and in the safety and nutritional value of the resulting products.A small increase has been made in Government expenditure on food research inthe current year and it is intended to make further increases when resourcesbecome available. In addition, a unit has been established in the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food to study the possibility of reducing losses dueto waste in the chain of food production, processing and distribution.39. The Government are determined to maintain high standards of plant andanimal health in this country. We have benefitted considerably from our islandposition and are anxious that harmonisation of health standards within theEuropean Community should lead to an increase in standards generally ratherthan to any reduction in our own.40. In order to further the improvement of the health and welfare of farmlivestock and to reduce disease loss the good working relationship that existsbetween the industry, the veterinary profession and the Government must becontinued. Control of notifiable diseases will always command a high priority:an immediate problem here is to re-establish national freedom from sheep scab.Excellent progress is being made with the eradication of bovine brucellosis.Over 80 per cent of herds in Great Britain and all herds in Northern Ireland arenow brucellosis accredited and by the end of 1979 all the remaining herds willhave been subject to compulsory eradication measures. Eradication of the warblefly is also under way and the next two or three years should see a drastic reductionin the incidence of this infestation. All these measures make a vital contributionto the productivity of the livestock industry; but other diseases and conditionsremain such as mastitis, parasitism and low fertility which cause considerableloss of production and these could, with advantage, be tackled at farm level bypreventive measures in order to reduce this avoidable loss. Consideration isalso being given to a long-term policy for enzootic bovine leukosis.41. The Government are considering their future strategy for plant healthwith particular reference to the implications of the Community&apos;s Directivedesigned to prevent the introduction of plant pests and diseases into MemberStates, and to any changes which may be necessary both for the United Kingdom&apos;sexternal safeguards and for our internal plant health regime. In this the Govern-menfs Certification Schemes play a prominent part in ensuring a high standardof plant stock.42. Plant breeding will continue to be the fundamental way of increasing thepotential yield of crops and grass, with other measures being concerned mainlywith exploiting or safeguarding that genetic potential. The Government haveencouraged plant breeders to invest in the necessary long-term development andselection programmes by extending the range of species eligible for Plant VarietyRights and by moderating the charges for official trials. The Government are25
also continuing to seek improvements in the Community&apos;s arrangements forseeds, notably by a more flexible approach to germination standards to allow forvariations in climate. The arrangements for determining rates for the herbageseed subsidy have already been improved; and with this improved incentive forour growers the Government have asked the United Kingdom Seeds Executiveto consider with the seeds industry and trade the possibility of increasing theproportion of home-produced herbage seed, imports currently accounting foraround half our requirements at an annual cost of about  10 million.26mANNEX IVMARKETING AND PROCESSING1. Increased production cannot be an end in itself; it must meet the needs ofthe market. The home market is large; there are further opportunities overseas,and home producers, processors and distributors can all share in the gains fromhigher output. But the potential gain will be realised only if attention is paid tothe consumers requirements.Marketing2. Farmers must seek to supply at a competitive price what the buyer wants,whether the buyer is a processor, wholesaler, retailer or direct consumer, andthey will need to be ready to adjust production to meet their customers&apos; re-quirements in an increasingly diverse market. Recent developments have in-creased the options available to the seller and buyer by making possible morevaried and flexible marketing opportunities. These include changes at the pro-duction level, such as the development of farm-gate and pick-your-own sales,technical advances such as the extension of the harvesting season by the intro-duction of early and later maturing varieties, and the development of bettermethods of storage and damage control which can effectively extend the market-ing period.3. Our producers now have to compete in a Community market consistingof nine countries, and expected in time to expand to twelve. The challenges facingthem are different, and in many cases the arrangements of the past are no longerfully appropriate. In some cases it is Community rules which require changes; inothers it is the need to meet the competition from producers in other countries,some of whom have highly developed marketing skills. In the milk sector, theGovernment have negotiated changes in the Community rules which will enablethe Milk Marketing Boards to continue to play a central part in maintaining ahighly efficient system of marketing and distribution. In other sectors, means ofenabling producers to adapt to changing market demands will need to beexplored. This is a point which the advisory services will have increasingly inmind. In some cases, the Community provides specific incentives to farmers toform producer groups and this will influence the development of policy. It doesnot however rule out national initiatives in certain areas.4. In this country a number of organisations already exist to help farmersmarket their produce. The Central Council for Agricultural and HorticulturalCo-operation and the central co-operative organisations have an important roleto play in helping producers who are trying to find the best forms of commercialorganisation to suit today&apos;s circumstances, and increasing consideration willhave to be given to the better marketing opportunities which co-operation mayoffer. Bodies such as the Marketing Boards, the Meat and Livestock Commission,the Home Grown Cereals Authority, the Apple and Pear Development Council,and the Eggs Authority have some responsibilities for promoting orderlymarketing. They have in the past done much to keep producers in touch withmarket trends and to bring home the need to recognise the mutual interests of27
producers, traders and consumers. In the future there may be scope for organi-sations with responsibilities in these fields to give more attention to this keyarea. For example, the Community recently adopted a measure to providesubstantial assistance to the improvement of facilities for marketing agriculturalproduce, but the stringent conditions attached to this aid mean that it will begranted only to those projects of benefit to producers that demonstrate aware-ness of the demands of the market and the ability of their products to meet thosedemands. The emphasis which it places on development of national programmesfor particular sectors means that the Government, producers, processors andtraders, and the relevant statutory organisations, will have to give close attentionto the best methods of achieving specific marketing objectives.5. The Government attach particular importance to the marketing sector,and believe that it is in this field that British agriculture is likely to face the mostserious challenges in the next few years. With this in mind, the Government havedecided to set up a Committee of Inquiry into agricultural marketing, with termsof reference which will enable it to carry out a review of the existing marketingarrangements in this country, to identify those areas where there is greatest scopefor improvement, and to make early recommendations on future action.Processing6. The food and drink manufacturing industries account for about 12 percent of total manufacturing net output and a substantial proportion of theirproduction comes from sectors which are heavily dependent upon home-produced raw materials. Increased production of these raw materials would offerthe opportunity for increased processing in the United Kingdom. It is in thenational interest that food and drink manufacturers increase their efficiency andachieve higher sales of finished products, and that as high a proportion as iseconomically possible of the raw materials used by manufacturers should behome-produced.7. The Government attach great importance to achieving the objectives ofthe Industrial Strategy in the food and drink manufacturing industries, the mainaim of which is to bring about a permanent improvement in our economicperformance. For this purpose it is necessary to identify and exploit areas forexpansion in both home and overseas markets and to take action to improveproductivity and efficiency. The extent to which increasing market shares can beachieved will depend both upon the efficiency of food and drink manufacturersand also upon a regular supply of home-produced raw materials of the rightquality at a competitive price.Exports8. Both our farming and our food industries have opportunities to increasetheir share of the important markets abroad for processed and unprocessedfood, as well as for beverages and other items such as breeding stock (Table IV. 1).Exports of food, drink and related items can be expected to continue to increase,and so add to the demand for British farm produce. Again both farmer andprocessor will have to be fully sensitive to the customers requirements to makethe most of these opportunities.28Table IV.1: Value of United Kingdom Exports of Food, Feed and Drink  million (fob)EXPORTS	1972	1973	1976	1977Live animals	40	59	62	109Meat and meat preparations	49	80	182	251Dairy products and eggs	22	44	115	98Fish and fish preparations	29	43	81	107Cereals and cereal preparations	34	54	134	211Fruit and vegetables	31	43	84	110Sugar and sugar preparations	47	61	129	112Coffee, tea and cocoa	51	61	142	279Animal feedingstuffs	17	30	45	60Miscellaneous food and agricultural				preparations	49	71	121	173TOTAL FOOD AND FEED	369	546	1,095	1,510of which       European Community	162	267	596	871Third Countries	207	279	499	639DRINKof which       European CommunityThird CountriesINDEX (1972=100)FOOD:- VolumeValueUnit ValueDRINK:- VolumeValueUnit Value266	305	524	62948	55	107	129218	250	417	500100	126	141	160100	148	299	410100	119	219	272100	113	132	137100	115	197	236100	101	147	16929
DANNEX VCOMMODITIES: THE PROSPECTS1. In reaching their conclusion on the overall prospects for the UnitedKingdom agricultural industry, the Government took account of the prospectsfor the main individual commodities, and have considered the scope for anddesirability of the expansion of output of those products.2. The technical possibilities for higher production vary from commodity tocommodity, as do the relative economic advantages of expanding output. Withinthe scope for the overall development of the industry, priority should be given tothose sectors for which the United Kingdom has an advantage within theEuropean Community. The relative output levels of different products cannot,however, be influenced by the use of policy instruments with a wide impact suchas green currency changes and tax measures. In addition, the support prices setunder the common agricultural policy determine the relativities for differentproducts throughout the Community. There is, therefore, only limited scope foraction by individual Member States to influence the output of particularcommodities. Nevertheless, in taking such steps as are open to them and inconsidering Community measures, the Government will be guided by the con-clusions set out below.Milk3. Milk remains the key commodity, accounting for over 20 per cent of thetotal output of British farming. Recent uncertainties surrounding the future ofthe Milk Marketing Boards and the post-transitional pricing arrangements forliquid milk have now been resolved, so giving the industry a secure frameworkwithin which to operate.4. The Government will maintain their pressure for sensible Communitymilk production. An effective common agricultural policy should encouragespecialisation of production in the areas best fitted for it. In view of its naturaladvantages, better industrial structure, and marketing arrangements designed tosustain a high level of demand, the home industry should be in a position toproduce a greater proportion of Community milk supplies and so to provide abigger share of the United Kingdom demand for milk and milk products fromhome production.5. Production is currently running at record levels, due largely to rapidincreases in yields per cow in recent years. A number of factors have contributedto this. Cullings of low-yielding cows have raised the average quality of thenational herd; economies of scale have encouraged a move towards largerherds, which in general tend to produce higher than average yields per cow;improvements in health and genetic standards have raised yields; and there havebeen improvements in grassland management and conservation, coupled withimproved nutrition resulting from the increased use of concentrated feed. Whathappens in future will depend to some extent upon relative movements in theprice of milk and concentrates and upon the benefits offered by continuedgrassland improvements. The present indications are that yields will continueto rise and provide the main basis for the expansion of milk production.306. Discussion has been resumed in Brussels on the proposals to harmonisehealth and hygiene standards in the Community. But, after allowing for agree-ment to be reached and for full implementation to be achieved, it can be assumedthat virtually the whole of the demand for liquid milk will continue to be metfrom home production for many years to come. It will, however, be importantfor the industry to make every effort to maintain consumption, bearing in mindconsumers&apos; reactions to prices and the availability of substitute powdered products.The extension of the free school milk scheme to children aged 7 to 11 could how-ever help to stimulate liquid consumption.7. There are opportunities for increasing consumption of other freshproducts such as cream and yoghurt; but the butter and cheese markets wherewe have still achieved only one-third and two-thirds self-sufficiency levels re-spectively  provide the main scope for the expansion of home production. TheGovernment believe that this objective can be achieved consistently with theoperation of the common agricultural policy and our obligations to NewZealand. At the same time it is clear that, with a world surplus in dairy pro-duction and a decline in consumption, especially for butter as Communityprice increases work their way through, there will be strong competition on theUnited Kingdom market. It is essential, therefore, that our own producers andmanufacturers should be fully competitive with overseas suppliers, particularlythose from the rest of the Community, and that the industry should continue togive a high priority to marketing.8. So long as these conditions can be met, the Government share the con-clusion of the report on milk products commissioned by the Food and DrinkManufacturing Economic Development Committee that home production shouldachieve a substantial increase in its share of the United Kingdom cheese market.Likewise, they endorse the view taken in the report on the need for the industryto secure the returns necessary to encourage manufacturers to expand theircapacity and to improve their efficiency and price competitiveness so as toincrease their share of the butter market. An increase in butter production willlead to an increase in the production of skimmed milk and skimmed milk powder.The Government recognise the problems associated with the world surplus ofskimmed milk powder, and will continue to support efforts both within theCommunity and more widely to achieve a better balance between supply anddemand.Beef9. The pure beef herd is currently about half the size of the dairy herd. Beefproduction in the United Kingdom depends substantially on the well-being of thedairy sector and on the readiness of dairy farmers to breed calves of good beefpotential. The Government still believe that the national advantage is bestserved by deriving the greater part of our beef production from the dairy herdrather than from lowland pure beef herds. Nevertheless, the rearing of pure beefcattle will help to make the most effective use of land in certain areas, particularlyin the hills, and the movement of young cattle from the hills for finishing inthe lowlands is an important aspect of our beef industry.31
10. A significant part of the record 1975 home beef production came fromthe slaughter of breeding animals. It now seems much more likely that a betterstarting point to consider the potential for the future is the average annual levelof production from 1976 to 1978, a level which was higher than in any yearprior to 1974. Actual levels achieved will depend on a number of factors, in-cluding the cyclical nature of beef production and the balance between returnsto producers from beef, dairying and the production of other meats. Longer-term improvements in husbandry, including increased efficiency in feed conversion,advances in disease control and eradication, and a steady rise in carcase weightswill also affect the level of output.11. The major need in the beef sector is for stability, particularly in view ofthe length of time needed to produce the finished animal. The Government,through the Redmeat Slaughterhouse Industry Scheme, are continuing toencourage investment in the slaughtering industry to enable it to meet thestandards required by United Kingdom and Community hygiene regulations.Investment is, however, put in jeopardy if a high throughput is not maintained.Consumer demand for beef is particularly sensitive to price changes. Rapidprice fluctuations are undesirable and high prices can lead to sharp reductions inconsumption.12. The Government attach importance to maintaining our dual supportsystem, in which variable premiums are combined with intervention to underpinboth the market and producers&apos; returns. Stability in supplies and prices demandsfrom producers a continued substantial level of home production. Imports,including carcase beef and live cattle coming traditionally from the IrishRepublic and carcase beef brought in from third countries under special arrange-ments, will still be required by the home market. To some extent these will bebalanced by beef exports. The Governments view is that to meet home andexport requirements domestic production should continue broadly at currentlevels. Whether or not there is scope for any worthwhile expansion of productionwill depend primarily on the future level of domestic demand.Mutton and Lamb13. The United Kingdom is well suited for the production of mutton andlamb and has developed efficient grass-fed systems complementary to rearingsystems which make full use of hill land of limited value for other enterprises.Imported frozen lamb, mainly from New Zealand, provides an important sourceof supply, particularly during the first half of the year. Despite the underlyingdownward trend in consumption in the United Kingdom, lamb is likely toremain a staple part of our diet so long as price relativities with other meats arenot seriously disturbed. Elsewhere in the European Community fresh lamb ismore of a luxury and commands a high price. Frozen lamb is not popular on theContinent but fresh lamb consumption is growing and creates a comparativelysmall, but expanding, export demand for better quality United Kingdom lamb.14. Although part of the United Kingdom export trade is at present in-hibited by French import controls, an expansion of the British sheep flock isjustified and necessary to meet this export demand while maintaining supplies to32the major home market. Frozen lamb imports, mainly from New Zealand, atabout the present level will remain essential to complement home production.The rate at which freer intra-Community trade and Community productiongenerally develop will depend on the outcome of the current discussions ofcommon market arrangments, but British producers will continue to provide themajor part of Community supplies of fresh lamb, and we shall remain the majorconsumers of lamb in the Community.Pigs15. United Kingdom pig producers and processors have faced particulardifficulties in recent years. The breeding herd fell by nearly 8 per cent during1977 to 18 per cent below December 1973, but the 1978 figures show somerecovery. The impact of cyclical factors was accentuated by the sharp increase incereal prices in late 1976 which was maintained throughout much of 1977 beforefeed costs became relatively stable in 1978, and by the inequitable method ofcalculating the monetary compensatory amounts in this sector which has con-tinued to distort the market for pigs, bacon and ham.16. Production of pigmeat remains at a relatively low level, and providesonly some 75 per cent of total domestic consumption of pigmeat. Within thetotal, home production meets almost all the demand for pork, since importsfrom all but a few countries are restricted by health considerations, while over55 per cent of the bacon consumed here is imported.17. Assuming no significant changes in the main factors governing trade inlive animals and fresh pork, home production is expected to continue to supplyvirtually all our requirements for fresh pork, which are likely to increase.Consumption of products such as sausages and pies is also likely still to be metin the main from domestic production. Future levels of output of bacon andham will, however, depend on the domestic industry&apos;s ability to compete success-fully for markets with imported supplies. This will be influenced both by tradingconditions within the Community and by the industry&apos;s own success in maintainingand improving the quality of its products and in matching the marketingefforts of its main competitors. The Government welcome the industry&apos;s in-tention to work out a marketing strategy, as proposed by the Sector WorkingGroup for Meat Products of the Food and Drink Manufacturing EconomicDevelopment Committee. For their part the Government will continue to seekfurther improvements in the method of calculating the monetary compensatoryamounts.Poultry and Eggs18. In recent years the home poultrymeat industry has satisfied the growingdomestic demand for poultrymeat and has developed valuable export markets.There has also been an important growth in exports of hatching eggs and stockfor rearing and breeding. Competition for markets both within the Communityand outside is very keen. The considerable investment, which the industry hasundertaken in recent years with Government assistance, to bring its slaughtering33
premises up to high standards should provide a firm base from which theindustry can aim to satisfy the projected further growth in home demand andcontinue its efforts to secure export markets.19. The United Kingdom is also no w a net exporter of eggs. The main concernof home producers will however remain the level of internal demand. Much willdepend on the success which the industry, with the support of the Eggs Authority,has in maintaining or increasing the level of home consumption. Sustainedimprovement in yields per bird and other improvements in technical efficiencyshould enable the industry to continue fully to meet the demands of the homemarket and to take advantage of export opportunities, although the size of thelaying flock may fall.Cereals20. In 1975 and 1976 yields, area and therefore production fell significantlybelow 1974 levels as a result of the exceptional weather conditions. The 1974crop was not exceeded until the 1977 harvest, when a record crop came from aslightly diminished area but with excellent growing conditions. Although, con-trary to expectations, areas in 1975, 1976 and 1977 were below the 1974 level,in 1978, thanks partly to exceptionally good weather for cultivation in theautumn of 1977, the area of cereals regained the levels of the early 1970s. Asyields were also high in 1978 production again reached a record level. A modestfurther switch of area out of grassland seems likely, although perhaps not on thescale previously expected. In addition there appears to be a long-term under-lying trend to increased yields, masked in the drought years of 1975 and 1976.This should give scope for further increases in production over the next fiveyears, with the wider adoption of new agricultural technology and of high-yielding varieties of wheat. These increases of production are likely to lead to agrowing United Kingdom self-sufficiency in feed grains; in the exceptional con-ditions of the 1977 harvest, when an unusually high proportion of barley wassown and the difficult harvesting conditions resulted in a low-quality wheat crop,we reached net self-sufficiency in feed grains for the first time, some smallintervention purchasing of barley occurred and barley exports reached recordlevels. In view of the size of the 1978 harvest, barley production is again likelyto exceed domestic requirements.21. Notwithstanding this growing self-sufficiency in feed grains, the UnitedKingdom will need to import some 3 to 4 million tonnes of wheat for milling, ofwhich 1  to 2 million tonnes will be the high quality North American hard wheatsrequired to produce the type of bread consumed in this country. The quantity ofhard wheat needed in the bread grist will vary somewhat from year to yeardepending on the quality of European wheat, which varies according to weatherconditions. The proportion of home-grown soft wheat in the grist can be ex-pected to continue to rise gradually, especially if new varieties which combinebetter yields with higher milling quality become available. But self-sufficiency inmilling wheat could not be achieved without either a change in the type of breadeaten or substantial changes in baking technology. Even if technological de-velopments permitted a substantial shift towards the use of home-grown wheatin bread, the gradual but steady decline in bread consumption could inhibit the34capital investment which the baking industry would need to make in order toadopt it. About 1-J to 2 million tonnes of imported maize will also be required bythe distilling, starch, glucose and other food industries and some may still beimported for use in feedstuffs.Sugar22. The Governments approach to Community sugar policy is that it shouldaim to provide support to efficient producers at a level which brings supply anddemand into a more balanced relationship, so providing supplies to consumers atreasonable prices while minimising the cost of Community support measures.Community policy must take full account of the Community&apos;s continuing LomeConvention commitments for the import of cane sugar from the developingcountries; and the Government attach the highest importance to these commit-ments. Regard must be had also to the development of alternative sweetenerswhich can affect demand for sugar.23. United Kingdom sugar beet production has recovered in the past yearfrom the abnormally low yields resulting from adverse conditions in the pre-vious three years. Despite the very low profitability over those years there was aresumption in 1978 of the previous trend of increasing beet area, after a standstillin 1977. The trend to an increase in yield of white sugar per hectare of sugar beetis also expected to be re-established over the next few years. Some further ex-pansion of area may be expected given that the crop is likely to remain econo-mically attractive compared with competing crops, and is justified in view of theefficiency of United Kingdom beet production and processing and the con-tribution it can make to our balance of payments.Oilseed rape24. Oilseed rape production has continued to expand over the last few yearsand further growth is expected so long as the crop remains profitable relative tothe other arable crops notably sugar beet but also cereals and potatoes withwhich it is in competition for land.Potatoes25. The outlook for potatoes is subject to some uncertainties, mainlybecause the nature of any eventual Community regime and of consequentchanges in domestic arrangements cannot yet be foreseen. But total demand forpotatoes in fresh and processed forms is expected to remain at about presentlevels and it will be the Governments objective that this should be met so far aspossible from home production. With a continuing improvement in yields, asmaller planted area is likely to be required. The changes in support arrangementswhich are expected over the next few years will accentuate the need for improvedmarketing of the domestic crop, including meeting demand for processedproducts.35
Horticulture26. Horticultural production is diverse and, while it is likely to continue toexpand significantly over the next few years, rates of increase will vary consider-ably between different products. Under the common agricultural policy horti-culture prices are more dependent on market prices than are the prices of themain agricultural crops. The competitiveness of domestic production is thereforelinked to some degree with the relative value of sterling.27. Apple production is likely to increase, as a result of more intensiveorchard planting. Other top fruits are expected to continue their slow decline.Production of soft fruits is expected to increase in response to higher demand ifproblems in harvesting can be overcome through an increase in pick-your-ownsystems or by the development of harvesting machinery for fruit for processing.28. For field vegetables a continued increase in output is likely as productionexpands to meet home demand and as soil and climatic advantages are exploitedto take advantage of export opportunities. Production is also likely to increase invalue as higher-value crops are substituted for lower-value ones.29. Demand for protected crops could also increase substantially. This demandcould be met to some extent from increased home output provided that prod-uction costs can be kept under control, particularly by maximising heat con-servation and adopting low energy cultivation techniques where appropriate.Increases in costs could lead to a shift from edible crops towards high-valueornamentals.30. The production of outdoor ornamental crops, including bulbs, flowers andhardy nursery stock, could also increase significantly in response to increasedpurchasing power at home and the continued development of markets whichhave been captured abroad.Hops31. Because of over-production both inside and outside the EuropeanCommunity, no increase in the area of hops in the Community is permitted untilthe beginning of 1980. As a result of their controlled system of production andmarketing, United Kingdom growers of hops have suffered less than most fromprice fluctuations caused by surpluses, and should be well placed to take ad-vantage of any opportunity to increase output and sales when the area restrictionends.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by McCorquodale Printers Ltd.HM (W) 0235 Dd. 148309 K96 2/79 McC 3336/2

istry of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodPossible patterns ofagricultural production in theUnited Kingdom by 1983London: Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office
(g) Crown copyright 1979First published 1979ISBN 0 11 240326 3Possible patterns of agriculturalproduction in the United Kingdomby 1983Introduction1. This note presents the results of a study of two possible patterns of agriculturalproduction in the United Kingdom some five years hence. The study was undertakenin connection with the preparation of the White Paper &quot;Farming and the Nation&quot;.The analysis is based on projections of yields, assumptions concerning improvementsin the efficiency of resource use and alternative levels of producers&apos; real prices. Likelydevelopments in the demand for food are also taken into account. The projectedpatterns of production are compared with the position in recent years and details ofthe assumptions required for an exercise of this kind are given in order to facilitatefurther discussion of the future development of the agricultural industry.2. Only two from among a wide range of possible future production patterns areconsidered. The scope for variation is considerable, since agricultural production coverssome ten main commodity groupings (and each of these may include numerousand often quite different commodities). Also, the amount of land available for farmingis declining, and expansion of the area for one commodity pre-empts the land andother resources that might be used for another. Since changes tend to take placerelatively slowly, it is likely that the pattern of output in 1983 will be influenced by theexisting pattern. It will also depend on the scope for improvements of a technicalkind (eg in yields); on the development of systems leading to improvements in input/output ratios; and on relative commodity real price and profitability levels.3. The assessments which are presented are not intended to be forecasts of what willhappen nor should they be interpreted as norms that should be achieved regardless ofthe economic circumstances. The aim is much more limited. It is to provide broadindications of what, seen from the present production base, may be reasonably expectedto happen provided certain assumed technical and real price changes materialise,and assuming that no serious disruptions arise during the projection period. Theprojected figures should not be taken to be definitive and are put forward to providea basis for further consideration of production prospects.Assumptions4. Any projection of future agricultural production must involve assumptions aboutthe rate of technical change (such as changes in the yields of crops and livestock1
products, and of feed to output conversion rates), and about economic factors sucHRproducer prices and cost changes. For this study the starting point was to projecta pattern of United Kingdom agricultural production, taking account of the technicalpossibilities and, for example, changes in livestock numbers already in train. Thisyielded the production projection based on the assumption of constant real prices.The projections obtained in this way were then adjusted to take account of the alterna-tive assumption of declining real prices. The two possible production patterns derivedin this way are presented below. These projections are not meant to simulate whatis likely to take place over the next five years but it is hoped that they will provide abasis for comparison with alternative assessments made, possibly by organisationsconcerned with the future development of the industry.5. For the first set of projections it is assumed that, in general, producers&apos; realprices remain unchanged to 1983 at their 1977 levels. In other words, prices receivedby producers are taken to increase in money terms at broadly the same rate as increasesin the general level of prices in the economy. For the second and alternative set, it isassumed that producers&apos; real prices, in general, decline by 1 % per annum from 1977to 1983, ie by just over 6% over the period. In the past, real prices have fluctuatedand the movements have varied, often to a marked extent, between the various com-modities; but since the mid-1950s there has been a decline of about 1 % per annumon average. It needs to be re-emphasised that the general price assumptions are notintended to convey judgments about how agricultural real prices are likely to changein practice over the next six years. Exceptionally, in the case of poultrymeat, eggs andpotatoes, the method of projection, which is outlined below, precludes the need tomake specific assumptions about producers&apos; real prices.6. The assumptions relating to the possible technical developments over the periodto 1983 were made after considering progress over the last decade, incorporatingadvice from technical experts within the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodand taking account of the views of outside organisations. Essentially the projectionsassume the contmuing steady introduction of new products and techniques and thewider application of recent developments. Improvements in livestock stocking rates,as well as increases in the yields of crops and livestock, have need assumed.7. For this exercise, agricultural commodities are divided into two general categories.First, there are activities such as most field and horticultural crops, sheep, beef anddairying, for which the projections are made by following through the implicationsof the technical and price assumptions, but in the case of livestock, taking accountof production changes over the next two years which are considered to be alreadyin train. For poultrymeat, eggs and potatoes, however, the projections are based on&quot;market clearing&quot; models. Models of this type assume that whatever quantity ofproduct comes on the market will be absorbed, if necessary, by means of a priceadjustment. Such models are appropriate for commodities for which the productioncycle is relatively short, for which we are virtually self-sufficient and for which pricescan fluctuate significantly. For pigmeat the method needs to allow for the morepronounced cyclical nature of production, and for the competing requirements of thepork and bacon markets. The projections for individual commodities take accountof the overall constraint on production imposed by the availability of land for agricul-ture and, where relevant, inter-relationships between commodities.2ftAlthough the projected 1983 production indices shown for the various commoditiesare based on 1977 final figures, the 1978 provisional estimates are included in all tablesfor comparative purposes and have been taken into consideration in making thecommodity projections themselves.The projectionsTotal Agricultural Area9. The rate of loss of agricultural land depends upon the demand for land for non-agricultural purposes and policies which affect the transfer of land from farming toother uses. As a result of urban and industrial development, and the creation of newrecreational areas, roads and forests, the area of agricultural land is declining. Between1971 and 1978 the total area included in agricultural holdings not, therefore, includingcommon rough grazings fell, on average, by about 50,000 hectares per year, andthis has limited both the scope for expansion of the arable area and the stock-carryingcapacity of the farming sector. Any projections of the scale of agricultural outputneed to rest on assumptions about the available land area, and in this study thecontinuation of an average loss of 50,000 hectares per annum has been assumed,implying a total loss of 250,000 hectares over the five year period from 1978 to 1983.This assumption has implications for the total area devoted to tillage including, inparticular, the cereals and grassland areas. The projected grassland and rough grazingareas also affect the implied stocking rates. A summary of crop areas is given inTable 1.Milk and Beef10. The projections relating to the dairy sector are considered first since the sizeof the dairy herd influences the output of beef through the projected supplies of dairycalves and culled dairy cows. In assessing prospects for the size of the dairy sectoraccount is taken of assumed returns from the sale of calves and culled cows. Withconstant real prices, milk yield per cow is assumed to increase from the 1977 level of4,452 litres/cow to about 5,060, ie an increase of about 2 % per annum. It should benoted, however, that the average yield in 1978 is estimated to be high relative to 1977so that the trend increase assumed for the years 1978 to 1983 is about If % per annum.A summary of milk and other yields is given in Table 2 and is also shown on graphs 1-4.In projecting the size of the United Kingdom dairy cow herd in 1983, the latest estimatesof dairy cow numbers have been used and these are assumed to reflect the full effectsof price changes to date. Taking these factors into account, on the constantreal price assumption the dairy cow numbers at June 1983 are projected at 3,335thousand, about 2% higher than in June 1977 and than the provisional figurefor June 1978. A summary of livestock numbers is given in Table 3. With yield percow projected to be nearly 14% higher than in 1977 the overall volume of milk pro-duction in 1983 compared with 1977, is projected to be higher by about 2,280 millionlitres, or almost 16%. On the assumption that real prices decline by 1 % per annum,dairy cow numbers at June 1983 are projected to be 3,200 thousand, while averageyields per cow are projected at 4,970 litres, somewhat lower than the projected yieldat constant prices, but still over 11 % higher than in 1977 and 1\ % more than the esti-mated yield for 1978. The overall volume of milk production, compared with 1977,3
is projected to be higher by 1,325 million litres or 9%. A summary of productionlevels is given in Table 4.11. Constant real prices would involve little change in the total consumption ofmilk in liquid and manufactured form. This is because the slight downward trend indemand is largely offset by a small positive income elasticity. Consumption of cheesehas been rising in recent years, due to an upward trend reinforced by some incomeeffect, and this is expected to continue. Under the assumption of constant real prices,consumption of butter, on the other hand, is expected to fall slightly as income effectsare more than offset by a downward trend in demand. Consumption of milk in theform of other manufactured products is not expected to change significantly over theperiod. With declining real prices, although butter consumption might show someincrease, the total consumption of milk in all forms is not expected to be affectedappreciably because the price elasticity of demand for most milk products is relativelylow.12. The size of the United Kingdom beef breeding herd has been declining since1975. If producer prices remain constant in real terms, it is considered that this declinewould slow down significantly and stability soon be achieved. In making the projectionsa price elasticity of supply (in terms of beef cow numbers) of 1-2 was used, but itwas also assumed that the response to a price change would take three years tocomplete. In other words, the response to, say, a 1 % real price fall would be a 1 -2 %reduction in the number of beef cows, seen as a 0-4 % reduction in each of three years.The projections have also taken into account latest short-term forecasts of the size ofthe beef cow herd to 1980, and these are considered to reflect adjustments to changesin producer returns up to the end of 1977. On this basis, numbers of beef cows in1983 are projected at 1,570 thousand, just under 1 % below the provisional figure for1978. With declining real prices the number of beef cows is projected at 1,510 thousand,about 5 % below the provisional 1978 level.13. The volume of beef production is dependent on the number of calves fattenedfrom the beef and the dairy herds, average carcase weights, the number of cull cowsslaughtered, and the volume of beef produced from imported store cattle. The-numberof calves to be reared for beef will depend on the level of total calf disappearance(ie calf slaughterings plus exports) and those reared for breeding replacements. Fromthe smaller beef herd projected for 1981 with constant real prices, some 1,070 thousandcalves are projected to be available for fattening; these, together with calves from thedairy herd but excluding calves slaughtered and exported, give a projected total of2,720 thousand fat cattle available for slaughter in 1983. On the assumption of decliningreal prices, the projected number would be smaller at about 2,650 thousand. Averagecarcase weights have been projected to increase by about 1 kg per head per annumafter taking into account the latest estimates for 1978. Based on these various assump-tions and allowing for the projected volume of beef from cull cows and importedstore cattle, production in 1983, given constant real prices, is projected at 1,070thousand tonnes. This is some 4% above the level in 1977. It is slightly lower than theAnnual Review estimate of 1978 production, but there are indications that the finalout-turn for 1978 production may be somewhat lower than the forecast given in theAnnual Review White Paper. With declining real prices production is projected at4arabut 1,045 thousand tonnes, showing a 1 % gain from the 1977 level and a smallreduction on the 1978 provisional estimate.14. Beef consumption at constant real prices is projected to increase by about 5 %,due almost entirely to the effects of assumed higher real incomes; with declining realprices, consumption is projected to increase in total by some 7%. These projectionsfollow from the assumptions about real price movements. In the event, the interactionbetween the supply and demand for beef and other meats would determine real pricelevels which may differ from those assumed. Therefore firm conclusions cannot bedrawn about the future domestic share of the United Kingdom beef market from theabove output projections.Mutton and Lamb15. The projections of mutton and lamb production assume, as in the case of beef,that the latest available forecasts of the size of the breeding flock in 1979 reflect thefull response to producer price changes that have taken place up to the present, andthat there will be no significant change over the period to 1983 in lambing rates andin average carcase weights. With producer prices remaining constant in real termsthe total breeding flock is projected to rise to 14,485 thousand head by 1983 which,compared with 13,702 thousand in 1977 and 14,149 thousand in 1978, representsincreases of about 6% and 2% respectively. Mutton and lamb production in 1977was somewhat below the level that might have been expected given the size of thebreeding flock. This reflected retention of breeding stock and late marketings, and acarryover of these into 1978. The projection for 1983 assumes the more normalrelationship between the breeding flock and production and accordingly the latter isprojected to grow more rapidly than the breeding flock during the five-year period1977-1983. The increase is put at about 12%, implying production of some 255thousand tonnes, compared with 229 thousand tonnes in 1977. On the other hand,with declining prices the lowland breeding flock is assumed to fall by some T35%for every 1 % fall in producers&apos; real price, the adjustment being spread over three years,while the upland breeding flock is assumed to remain static once responses to presentprice changes have been exhausted. With declining prices the overall size of theUnited Kingdom breeding flock is projected to be 14,130 thousand head by 1983.On this basis, mutton and lamb production would be about 250 thousand tonnes in1983 an increase of some 9% compared with 1977.16. The trend in demand for lamb has been steadily downwards for a number ofyears. This trend is expected to continue and the effect on consumption is only partlyoffset by the effect of higher incomes. Consumption at constant real prices is projectedto fall by almost 5% by 1983, and by 3% assuming declining real prices.Cereals17. The area planted to cereals is projected to increase from 3,706 thousand hectaresin 1977 to 3,850 thousand hectares in 1983 at constant real prices, and to 3,825 thousandhectares with declining real prices. The projected area for 1983 is similar to the pro-visional 1978 area and represents an increase of about 4% on 1977 at constant realprices and 3 % with declining real prices. Cereal yields have been on a rising trend5
and this is projected to continue over the coming years. At constant prices, the liKe-lihood of further improvement in wheat yields is greater than for other grains becauseof intensive research in this field. Thus a growth in wheat yield of 0-08 tonnes perhectare per annum over 1977 is assumed appreciably higher than the growth inyields projected for other cereals.18. The area sown with wheat tends to fluctuate from one year to the next, asdoes the average yield, depending on cultivation conditions in the autumn whenmost wheat is planted. In the autumn of 1976, sowing conditions were not goodand consequently the area of wheat in 1977 was below trend. It recovered in 1978following the excellent autumn cultivation weather in 1977. Assuming normal weatherconditions and constant real prices, the area planted with wheat is projected to riseby 1983. The combined area of barley, oats and other cereals is projected to be justunder its 1977 level. Applying the assumed yields to these projected areas implies,at constant real prices, a production of some 18,660 thousand tonnes of cereals by1983. This is about 11% higher than the actual crop harvested in 1977, but onlysome 7% higher than the forecast production for 1978. Slightly lower yields and areaare projected with declining real prices, implying a production of 18,265 thousandtonnes in 1983. This would be about 9% higher than production in 1977 but onlysome 5 % higher than estimated production for 1978.19. Total demand for cereals includes requirements for direct human consumptionand for animal feed. Since consumer demand for cereal products is not very sensitiveto small price changes, a broadly similar change is expected under both real priceassumptions. The demand for wheat used for milling is projected to fall by about3 %, but the demand for barley which is required for brewing and distilling is forecastto increase by 8% by 1983. The livestock projections suggest only a small changein the demand for cereals for animal feed.Sugar Beet20. The sugar beet area has been showing an upward trend and it is assumed, withconstant prices, that it will rise further to about 230 thousand hectares in 1983,compared with 202 thousand hectares in 1977 and 210 thousand hectares in 1978. Theyield of refined sugar per hectare will depend on the yield of beet, its sugar contentand the efficiency of the extracting processes. The yield of refined sugar per hectarefrom the 1977 crop was 4-72 tonnes per hectare and is estimated at 4-9 tonnes perhectare in 1978. Production of refined sugar amounted to almost 950 thousand tonnesand around 1,030 thousand tonnes in 1977 and 1978 respectively. Yields of refinedsugar from sugar beet have been depressed in recent years, but improvements areexpected. It has been assumed that yields will be around 5-2 tonnes of refined sugarper hectare by 1983. On this basis, which allows for the improvement in extractionrates expected as a result of the British Sugar Corporation^ modernisation plan,refined sugar production would amount to about 1 -2 million tonnes in 1983, an increaseof about 26% over the quantity obtained in 1977 and 17% more than the provisional1978 level. With declining real prices the projected sugar beet area is 215 thousandhectares by 1983 and refined sugar production would be just over 1 -1 million tonnes, orabout 18% and 10% more than in 1977 and 1978 respectively.6In terms of refined sugar, demand at constant real prices is expected to fall byabout 4% by 1983. This overall decline reflects two opposing influences, namely,demand for packeted sugar which is projected to fall by 11%, and manufacturingdemand for sugar which is expected to increase somewhat. Consumption with decliningreal prices is also expected to fall from current levels: the underlying trend wouldmore than offset the effects of the lower price.Horticulture22. Since this sector comprises numerous fruit, vegetable and non-food crops,projections of the area devoted to it, and of output, are presented in aggregate terms.With constant real prices, total horticultural area is projected at 295 thousand hectaresin 1983. The long-term trend is for the volume of output to rise and it has beenassumed that this growth will continue at about 1 % per annum over the next fewyears. However, since the volume of output was well below trend in 1977, an increaseof 12% in output, at constant 1977 prices, is implied between 1977 and 1983.23. It is difficult to assess the likely changes in horticultural production if decliningreal prices are assumed. The sector is a diverse one and responsiveness to changes inreal returns will vary considerably by type of crop. These range from orchard fruitsand glasshouse crops, (for which considerable investment has already been committedand where supply adjustments may be expected to be spread over a long time-span),to field vegetables where adjustments can be made rapidly. Overall, a decline in realprices of 1 % per annum to 1983 would be expected to reduce somewhat the projectedcultivated area, particularly that devoted to the production of field vegetables. Theoutput projections with declining real prices show an increase of 8 % over 1977.24. Demand for fruit and vegetables is expected to rise by about 2% by 1983 givenconstant real prices, and by a little more than this if real prices decline. Within thisoverall change the effect on expenditure is likely to vary considerably by type ofproduct.Pigmeat25. Pigmeat production in the United Kingdom, as in most countries, has beencharacterised by significant cyclical movements. Production peaks can be identifiedin 1971/72, 1973/74 and 1977, with troughs in the intervening years and in 1978. Inthese circumstances any projection of pigmeat production cannot purport to relateto a particular year, especially in view of the variation which exists between cyclesboth in respect of their amplitudes and lengths. The output projection, therefore,must be taken as providing only an indication of the possible average productionlevel in the early 1980s.26. Of the total pigmeat consumed in the United Kingdom, roughly 40% is in theform of bacon, and 30% each as fresh pork and other pigmeat products such assausages, pies and pork luncheon meat. In recent years some 30 % of domestic pigmeatproduction has been used for bacon and ham; of the remaining 70%, about half isconsumed as fresh pork and the remainder as pork products. In the United Kingdomin the early 1980s the demand for fresh pork, at constant real prices, is expected toincrease by about 10 %, but that for bacon and most other pigmeat products (including7
imported produce) is expected to decline. For bacon the decline is put at 2l%%.&apos;,dfor the other products at about 5% by 1983. Thus the demand for all pigmeat, givenconstant prices, is expected to show little change over the period. A decline in realprices would not affect consumption significantly as the real prices of other meatswould also be falling.27. Given these projections of total market requirements in the United Kingdomfor pigmeat in the early 1980s and allowing for imports, the analysis suggests, withconstant real prices (implying also constant real cereal feed prices the main costitem in pigmeat production), a domestic pig breeding herd of about 895 thousand,considerably above that in 1977 and 1978. Total pigmeat production from a herdthis size would be about 940 thousand tonnes, an increase of nearly 4 % and 8 % over1977 and the 1978 (forecast).28. Declining real prices imply a reduction in the price of cereal feed (and thuspigmeat production costs), lower producer returns and lower prices of competingmeats. The reconciliation of output and demand suggests a United Kingdom pigbreeding herd in the early 1980s of about 865 thousand, somewhat below the 1976level but 4% and 3% above the 1977 and provisional 1978 estimates. Production ofpigmeat from a herd of this size would be about 910 thousand tonnes, about the sameas in 1977 and 4% more than in 1978.Poultrymeat, Eggs and Potatoes29. The United Kingdom is virtually self-sufficient in these products and theirproduction cycles are relatively short. Because of this, it seemed, as has already beenmentioned, more appropriate to use &quot;market clearing&quot; models. These attempt tosimulate the supply and demand adjusting processes of the market-place, rather thanto project solely on the basis of likely technical developments and on assumptionsabout the producer price. The &quot;market clearing&quot; approach assumes that changes inproduction are kept in line with changes in demand by means of price adjustments.The assumed rates of adjustment of both production and consumption to real pricechanges are the key factors in models of this sort, but the projections are also dependenton assumptions of productive efficiency and any underlying trend in demand.30. Poultrymeat production rose rapidly up to the early 1970s, but the rate ofincrease has slowed down in recent years as is indicated in Table 4. Consumption,which is largely governed by a strong upward trend, is projected to increase furtherto 1983. The volume of production required to meet this demand, assuming constantreal prices (including the price of cereal feed, the most important cost item), is putat 750 thousand tonnes, an increase of 11 % and 8% over the 1977 and 1978 forecastproduction figures respectively. In the case of eggs, production since 1970 has shownsome fluctuation around a slightly downward trend. The demand for eggs is projectedto decline marginally and production in 1983, at constant real prices, is projected tobe about 2% to 3% below the levels in 1977 and 1978.13. With declining real prices, the cost of cereals, and hence the implied costs ofproduction, would decline forbothpoultrymeatand eggs. However, theprice of compet-ing foods, such as other meats and proteins, would also be lower. In effect, therefore,8WKevels of consumption and production of these commodities by 1983 are projectedto be essentially the same under both real price assumptions.32. Given the uncertainty at present surrounding the precise form of an EEC regimefor potatoes, the 1983 output projections for this crop have also been made on theassumption that domestic supply is adjusted to meet changes in demand and that theUnited Kingdom remains virtually self-sufficient in respect of main-crop potatoes.Further concentration of production amongst growers, togetherwith technical advances,are expected to lead to increases in yields from about 28j tonnes per hectare in 1977to over 34\ tonnes per hectare in 1983. Given projected yields and assuming a con-tinued low price elasticity of demand for potatoes (including potato products),production and consumption would be about 6,680 thousand tonnes in 1983, anincrease of about 1 % on the 1977 level but a reduction of about 2% from the 1978forecast. The area of potatoes implied would be 194 thousand hectares. The projectedlevels of output and overall consumption remain virtually the same under both priceassumptions; an increase in the consumption of processed potato products is expectedto offset a decline in that of fresh potatoes.Overall assessment of the projections33. It has been indicated above that the commodity projections were made takingaccount of the relationships between products and the limitations on growth imposedby, for example, the assumption on the declining land area available for farmingpurposes. The implications for the area devoted to individual crops, includinggrassland,are shown in Table 1. The decline in grazing area is not matched by a proportionatedecline in the numbers of grazing livestock, so that higher stocking densities wouldclearly have to be achieved for the projections to have validity. However, under theassumption of declining real prices there would be virtually no change in stockingrates between 1978 and 1983.34. The aggregate gross output, gross input and net product indices (1975=100) foragriculture are shown in Table 5 for the period 1967 to 1978 (forecast) and projectedto 1983. To arrive at these annual indices the figures for individual commodities andinputs were valued at 1975 constant prices. The agricultural industry was seriouslydisrupted by the droughts of 1975 and 1976 and this is reflected in the large declinesin the volume of agricultural net product in those years (see graph 5). Some of theconsequences of these setbacks were carried over into 1977, when as Table 5 suggests,in spite of a sharp recovery, net product was still somewhat below the trend level.Production in 1978 no longer reflects the consequences of the setbacks of earlieryears, but as the figures for 1978 are still provisional, the rates of growth quoted inthe following paragraphs are expressed as percentage increases over the average for1977 and 1978 rather than on the 1978 figure only.35. The overall result, assuming constant agricultural prices in real terms, is thatthe volume of agricultural gross output is projected to increase by about 9 % abovethe 1977/78 level. The improvements in the efficiency of agricultural productionassumed are, in general, reflected in the lower usage of inputs per unit of output.Thus, with constant real prices, the overall volume of gross input into agriculture9
by 1983 is projected to be only some 4% over the 191111% level. These projections^rivalued at constant prices imply a volume increase of about 18% on the 1977/78 levelof agricultural net product (which is the difference between gross output, and grossinput and depreciation).36. With declining real prices, the projected growth of gross output of 5 % over theperiod is associated with an increase of almost 3j% in the volume of inputs used.Thus the increase in net product implied is 10j% over the period 1977/78 to 1983.37. The foregoing projections provide two views on the possible pattern of agriculturalproduction in the early 1980s based on certain specified assumptions about the rateof technical change and the development of output and input prices. In the event,agricultural production each year will be affected by weather and other factors andthus may in turn affect the eventual pattern of agricultural production some fiveyears hence. Also the growth of agricultural net product is unlikely to be smooth.The projections do however, provide points of reference for alternative and subsequentstudies into the development of the agricultural industry which may be undertakenby organisations interested in the future progress of the farming sector.&apos;000 hectar^	1			declining real prices	1,275 2,350 175	25 3,825	^- in oo in in c\ rt (s oo n *h m      cs m	4,932 2,167 6,865 11,797	6,263(6) 550	S o						-ejected)	Wit]							00						a		int ices						g						cn			in in in iS- t*- t*-	25 3,850	^- o o *o O On m cc on rt CS       cs m	4,989 2,231 6,859 11,848	tN O	o						on		const; real pr	tN rn i-i rt tN				cs tn No&quot;	3 00																						1						3&quot;							oo	.0	1,263 2,360 181	27 3,830	tN O in O in rt rt \d on tn tN cs     cs co	CNl CS On	5-o cn	o&quot; \o 00 00 g							on	provii				2^ om ri ri rt	f*i m \D g								r-t--on		to o in r- O on CO ^ rt	in to tn o	cs cs in cs to tn O &quot;n o to cs cs      m n	tn -rt t-- O to CS (S on CO rt rt on	O rt O in -* -*	o TO										tn		tN r-t rt	\o	TO							\o r-on		i-i cs in tn oo tn (N i-H^ CS	r- in tn oo *o	CS to TO on rt cs o oo cs cs     cs m	rt      in to cs *n m in 0o^ rt cs o	cn on in tj-	r-00 on^									rt (N	rn		ri t-^ ri	vo	CO							&quot;O		in fN	cs tn -^t in \o	tj- oo on in r-O On rn oo tn tN  rt         CS Tf	to OO (S 00 rt  CH  rt CS oo rt (S O	in tn m o-\ in co	00							on		o co cs					onfc									rt&quot; ri	tn		tjT ri r-&quot; ri rt	\o&quot;	00* rt				4														ingdt														; of each year					ro rn tn i-1 m CN tN CN	oo r-	*n in in in rt rt on cs oo r-CS rt       cs tn	oo to to tj-		o							on			tn		TO CO CS ri r^&quot; ri rt	in ft vo	q on	Notes: (a) Buildings, roadways, small woods.	1 o CO .g	grazing.	sr the UnitedTABLE 1  Crop areas at Juni					Wheat ...... ......
