CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE-PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 179 March 1979COPY NO80CABINETOPENNESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department1. The Ministerial Group on Disclosure of Official Information (GEN 29)under my chairmanship have been considering a draft Green Paper on theissues raised by a public right of access to official information and on thescope for developing existing practices.    The latest version of the draftis at Annex A.    Consistently with the Cabinet conclusion on 18 January aboutthe handling of Mr Freud&apos;s Official Information Bill, we had envisagedpublication of this, before the Bill reaches Report Stage on 6 April, as ameans of strengthening the case for not allowing the Bill to proceed toenactment in this Parliament.    We are in any case committed to publisha report of the study by officials of overseas experience, the conclusionsof which are incorporated in the draft Green Paper.2. GEN 29 have, however, come to the view that publication of aGreen Paper which lacked any positive commitment would be unlikely todeflect support from Mr Freud&apos;s Bill and that although procedural devicesmight be adopted at Report Stage to stop its further progress, we should beput in a very difficult political posture by resorting to them;  and, dependingon how long Parliament continues, it is uncertain whether they would besuccessful.    Before we go any further down this road, therefore, I mustseek a Cabinet view on whether, as the majority of GEN 29 think, we shouldbe ready to commit ourselves to a specific scheme providing for access toofficial documents.3. GEN 29 have ruled out the possibility of adopting the generalapproach of the Freud Bill.    In its scope and retrospective effect itrepresents a more radical approach than that adopted in any other country,embracing policy and working papers as well as Cabinet papers after 10years.    Also, by bringing in the courts as well as the ParliamentaryCommissioner for Administration (PCA) it would seriously erodeMinisterial accountability to Parliament.4. At the same time, we do not think that the further development ofpresent policy on the lines of the &quot;Information Directive&quot;, desirable thoughit might be in itself, would carry any conviction with Parliament.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. The only scheme which we believe would have a chanct of doing miswould be a scheme based on the proposals in the &quot;Justice&quot; Report, whichwould provide for a public right of access to official documents in accord-ance with a Code of Practice.    The &quot;Justice&quot; version of this code is atAnnex B.    Without legislation a Code on these lines could be introduce^with little delay;  and the principle of Ministerial accountability toParliament would be fully preserved.    The majority of GEN 29 consider^&apos;however, that anything less than a commitment to put the &quot;Justice&quot; schemeon to a statutory footing would not have sufficient impact on the supportersox the Freud approach.    The &quot;Justice&quot; report itself expressed the hope thatthis would be the basis eventually adopted.    The Code of Practice need hotitself form part of the main legislation, though there would no doubt bestrong pressure for it to be embodied in regulations.    GEN 29 agreed thatin any event, on grounds partly of cost, its effect should not be maderetrospective.6, A Code of Practice of this kind would represent a more gradualand evolutionary approach in a very difficult area.    At the same time itwould have significant implications for Ministerial discretion and for theuse of Civil Service manpower.    The direct and indirect costs, thoughunquantifiable, should not be under-rated.      But there was a strong feelingin the Group that, apart from the political merits of this course in relationto our October 1974 Manifesto commitment, this was the price which wouldhave to be paid for stopping the passage of the Freud Bill with some degreeof Parliamentary and public goodwill.7. There would remain, nevertheless, the tactical problem of how topromote any positive commitment of this  kind in relation to the handling ofthe Freud Bill at Report Stage.    This, together with the difficult questionof the appropriate Parliamentary machinery for monitoring the Code ofPractice, whether it should be the PCA or some other body, would have tobe further considered.    The terms of a Code of Practice would also, ofcourse, require detailed consideration.8, I invite the Cabinet&apos;s views on whether we should aim to block theFreud Bill:i.       with no Government commitment at this stage but a GreenPaper discussing the options for greater openness, and attendentdifficultie s; orii.       with a Government commitment to a scheme on the lines of&quot;Justice&quot;;  and if so, whether we should undertake to put such ascheme on a statutory footing.MRHome Office9 March 1979CONFIDENTIAL
GOVERNMENT:    A GREEN PAPER - DRAFT FOLLOWING GEN 29(79)5TH TINGreductionThis Green Paper is concerned .&quot;with the need for greater open-; of Government in this country.    It examines the experience ofer countries in the field of open government, especially in[ng to the public formal right of access to official records,considers how in the light of our own political and constitutiona;em we should best proceed.    The Government is not at presentBitted to a particular method - statutory or otherwise - ofiring greater openness.    The purpose of the paper is tother public and Parliamentary discussion of this important topic,jre decisions on it are taken.The Government would agree with many of the arguments for moremess, in particular that, as Government becomes more wide-;ing and more complex, Parliament and the citizen need more andter information to -i. hold Ministers and their departments more effectively toaccount;ii. increase public understanding of issues;Lii.     increase Parliamentary and public involvement indecisions; andiv. strengthen Parliamentary democracy and hence increasepublic confidence in it.*e are, however, problems inherent in some forms of increased-nness&apos;.   These are discussed later in this paper.Two issues are important (and must be dealt with) but are notaspects of &quot;openness&apos; considered in this Green Paper. Thesethe reform of the Official Secrets Act and the safeguarding ofLvidual privacy.
rm of the Official Secrets Act .The Governments proposals for the reform of the OfficiallECrets law have already &quot;been set out in the White Paper &quot;Reform(Section 2 of the Official Secrets-Act 1911&quot; (Cmnd 7285). Somespects have been discussed in- Standing Committee on the Official(formation Bill now before Parliament, and the Government will b&apos;eairing further proposals on the Report Stage.    The Governmentecognises that the 1 catch-all1 effect of Section 2 is no longeright and intends that it should be replaced by provisions whichjiild restrict criminal sanctions for unauthorised disclosure orlunication to a strictly limited range of information.This reform will not of itself increase the flow of informationGovernment since the criminal law is concerned only with whatt not to be disclosed and open government is concerned with whatlight to be disclosed.   But the Government see the reform oftction 2 as an essential step in creating a climate in which greaterfenness can prevail.   Also there is a link between reform of thefficial Secrets Act and any measure of open government in thatatters whose unauthorised disclosure will remain subject tofiffiinal sanctions would have to be among those exempted from anylegation or undertaking to make official information more freelyRilable. &apos;fivacjThe quantity of information that the Government and otherpncies possess about individuals raises a natural concern to ensurethe information is accurate, relevant and private (ie notleased to others or used for purposes for which it was not&quot;tended).   The Committee on Privacy, which reported in 1972^ 5012), drew particular attention to the potential dangers&apos;lsing from the use of computers for holding and handling personalUrination.    Following the White Paper &quot;Computers and Privacy&quot;6353), the Government set up the Data Protection Committee,report was published in December 1978 (Cmnd 73^1). That&quot;&quot;ittee recommended the establishment of a Data ProtectionCONFIDENTIAL
COKFIScNTlALKhority, which would implement, in both the public and the privatestor, principles that would be embodied in-i-frgislation. TheInciples that they recommend included the following:i. individuals should know what information is held aboutthem, why it is needed, how it will be used, by whom, for whatpurpose, and for how long need it be held;ii. information should only be used for the immediaterequirement for which it was collected, or subsequently wasauthorised;iii. it should be accurate and complete, be relevant&apos; for thepurpose for which it was collected and be sufficient for thatpurpose, without additional information of no relevance; andiv. individuals should be able to check and confirm that theseprinciples have been observed. .Committee went on to recommend that the Authority should establishes of Practice for different classes of data-handling applications,y believed that in general it was desirable that the individualuld have access to information held about him; but they gaveticular attention to the problems of access to information inas of special concern: material held by the police and securityvices, medical and social work records, employment and educationords, and statistical and research applications.The Committee^ report is now the subject of consultation betweenGovernment and interested parties in both public and privatetors.   In considering what safeguards are needed for the accuracy,evance and privacy of personal information held on computers, theernraent will also examine whether the same or other safeguardsneeded in relation to such information held on noncomputerisedlords.   These questions of individual privacy, affecting, as theyauthorities outside Government and computer users in the private
jtor, raise rather different questions from those involved in thecept of open government, which primarily affects the centralinistration.    The concern felt about such confidential personala almost certainly affects the public attitude to other informationd by public authorities.Main ThemeThe main debate on open government as such relates however notdata held on a single individual but to more wide-ranging policyisions.   These cover a spectrum from great national issues tose affecting the way of life of groups of people in a localunity. &quot; For the latter there have, over recent years, been,siderable developments in the rights of people to obtain informa-on decisions in the built environmentj that is to say, onIposals on roads, town plans, power station sites, etc. Thesejelopments will continue.   But again, this Green Paper is notected at this aspect of opennness, important as it is. Therent debate on open government is primarily concerned with thed for more openness in the wide range of issues and decisionsch affect the nation as a whole, or large sections of it.There is no fixed or agreed.definition of fopen governmentf.is a loose concept, implying &quot;different things to different people,can range from increased explanations of official policy and aferent style of government to a general public legal right ofess to all official documents, including Cabinet Committee papers,a^tmental working papers and raw files.    It can mean greater accessdocuments and records or greater readiness among Ministers andicials to argue individually and publicly about what they think,&amp;ve thought, about particular policies and decisions.Nor is it possible to establish, precisely and for all time,ffluch official information should be publisued, what sort of8rial this should be, and at v/hat point it should be revealed,hs same way, it is impossible to fix, exactly and for ever, whatTories of material should remain confidential, and for how long,and guidelines will need periodic revision.   How rules and
CONFIDENTIALidelines should be drawn and how -they should be enforced- is atter of judgment on which opinion will always vary.   Even amongose who argue for a public right of access there is no unanimityhow these issues should be resolved.a Practice Overseas -   &apos; .,  As the Government promised in the White Paper on the Officialcrets Act (Cmnd 7285, paragraph 49), as a background to theirnsideration of greater &quot;openness&apos; they examined the experiencenine other democracies as described in a study by a group officials.    The report of this study is being published.   In thejne countries the length of experience of more open governmenties greatly; only four have actually implemented legislationving the public a statutory right of access to a range of officialcuments.Three of the nine are Scandinavian countries and they have hade longest experience (Sweden for over two centuries; Norway andnraark within the last decade).   The United States embarked someve years ago on a radical and elaborate new system. Thetherlands and France have adopted legislation but have yet toplement it.   Australia and Canada are discussing possible develop-nts in existing practice.   A Bill is before Parliament in Australia,4 a Bill is being prepared in Canada.   The Federal Republic offfflany has no proposals for any new practices.It is as impossible to calculate the net benefits that aatutory right of access brings to the conduct of government as itto assess the net costs.   However it can be helpful to consider-ion of future development in this country to examine the institu-Qnal reasons why certain countries have adopted a statutory rightofficial information.In the case of Sweden, the long-standing public right toficial information is a necessary part of the country&apos;s distinctiveUtical and administrative framework.   The policy-making process is
tdy &quot;open&apos;, since new law is discussed by commissions, whosers, not necessarily very numerous, may be drawn from all sectorsciety.   Their deliberations are published, together with theBnts of Government ministries and the reports of parliamentaryittees. &quot; By means of a statutory right to information citizensJbetter able to see if the laws are being properly executedch of the interpretation and execution of Swedish law has beenIgned to independent administrative boards, immune from parliamentar&apos;tiny or questioning.    The purpose of the Freedom of the Pressis thus to reinforce the accountability of these executive agenciesdof officials in law.   It is completed by a system of administrativets and the Ombudsmen.Norway and Denmark do not have such a full system of autonomousexecuting boards,   Much administrative authority lies withsters.   Here, though, a distinction is made between Ministers1Itical and legal accountability.   A Government, of a single partycoalition, is politically accountable to Parliament.   If itsupport, it falls.   Under laws regulating the conduct ofInistration Ministers and officials can be individually prosecutedfailure to comply.    In Norway procedures for holding Ministersofficials to account for their administrative actions weredied in the 1962 Ombudsman Act and the 1967 Administration Act.enmark they were set out in the 1953 Ombudsman Act and the 1964nistrative Proceedings Act.   The 1970 Acts giving citizens autory right of access to official documents grew out of theseting procedures.   Parliament is not circumvented; its powers inarea were minimal.In the United States the introduction of a statutory right ofss to official documents was consistent with basic constitutionalciples.   The American Constitution.:declares that fcb;* people isreign.   Executive and legislature are each directly elected;act as a mutual check and balance, both seeking popular support,ation of powers, political parties that do not promote consensus-ding and the diversity of American society mean that when asion is being made, successive alliances in support or opposition^ constructed along every step of the way.   In this context,2ens&apos;enjoy a great deal of influence.   Extending it to include
ccess to official information builds on these-habits and givesitizens and their representatives additional leverage.   The Freedomf Information Act has opened up government departments andegulatory agencies that had seemed since the Second World Waro have become impervious to electoral pressure and inquiry.    It ishese bodies that are subject to freedom of information legislation,ot the policy-making presidential and legislative branches ofovernment, protected in the one case by * executive privilege1 andn the other by exemption from the Act&apos;s provisions,7, France and the Netherlands have not yet had any experience ofbe v/orking of their new arrangements - in France, the 1978 Law oneedom of &quot;Access to Administrative Documents and in the Netherlandshe 1978 Law on the Access to Administrative Information. Howevert is possible to appreciate whyboth these countries decided tontroduce legislation of this kind.8. In the case of France,although there is a complex code oftoinistrative law, setting out the rights and liabilities of alltate officials and the procedures by which these are enforced, theitizen may nonetheless find himself at some disadvantage in hisealings with the government.   The ordinary law courts have nourisdiction in matters concerning the state, the co-existence ofdicial and administrative courts brings about a conflict ofrisdiction in which the latter courts prevail, and state officials,0 at national, regional and local level enjoy substantialscretionary power, are protected against the ordinary law. Citizensve not found sufficient remedy in the appeals machinery providedadministrative tribunals or the Conseil d&apos;Etat. Complaintsnnot be effectively channelled through much of the press, radiotelevision.    Strict procedural regulations curtail the powers of6 Senate and the National Assembly.   Ministers are appointed by6 Prime Minister, himself appointed by the directly-elected^ident of the Republic.   Ministers must not be members ofHament.    It is notable that in France pressure for a statutorySftt of access has come as much frommembers of Parliament as from^viduals and interest groups.7
jn the Netherlands, the Second, more powea? ul, Chamber ofIrliament is elected from a nation-wide constituency.   Members actan important sense as representatives of national interest groups;ere is no whipping system.    Ministers may be summoned beforemnsittees of either house and they are in this way accountable,t they are protected, first because they are not themselves membersthe legislature and secondly because the difficulty of establishingd maintaining balanced coalition Governments means that Parliament^reluctantly rejects an&apos; entire Ministry.    Each house of Parliamentga Committee on Petitions to examine complaints about governmenttions affecting individuals.   Permanent and ad hoc committees arepowered to summon witnesses and a Committee of Enquiry has theof investigation.    It is against this background that recentch legislation must be seen.    The scheme giving a right of accesses into effect only when an enquirer has exhausted other means ofaining the information he seeks and, even then, it applies only toormation, not, save at departmental discretion, to actual documentsemselvesc   The scheme is designed to build on existing procedures &apos;assisting individuals to obtain information and evidence from^eminent departments but by methods which neither destroy thestitutional relationship between Ministers and their civilvants nor undermine the role of Parliament as the body principallyinstigating Government policy and decisions.In West GermanyJ/the Basic Law enshrines individual rights, executive authorityitempered by the division of authority between Federal and LandBtitutions and an elaborate system of Federal and Land courts hasJisdiction in administrative, labour, social and fiscal as well asand criminal law.    Since the end of the Second World War,wistrative departments at both Federal and Land level have madeMscious effort to be generous with information about executiveicies and decisions.Pitish SystemIhe British system of Parliamentary democracy has had a longimplex evolution, impossible to summarise here in all itslotions.   One feature however stands out as a key doctrine,
CONFIDENTIALJject itself to gradual modification and refinement - individualcollective Ministerial responsibility and accountability toliament.   This doctrine is the hub around which so much of ourinistrative and political life revolves.Although there are more often than not differences of opinionLen Ministerial colleagues, it is the resolution collectively-ofL that is central to any governments life. IndividualLsters would find it much more difficult to.preserve and defendLions if they could not rely on the public support of their[Leagues.   We are accustomed to adversarial politics - a two-PartyRem of Government and Opposition - and each government in turnlies on collective decision-taking to promote its policies.Alongside this collective responsibility is the individualluntability and answerability of each Minister to Parliament forpolicies and operations of his Department.   Parliament*s chiefion in controlling the activity of the Executive is scrutiny,jicisra and ultimately censure.    Individual Ministers, as well asgovernment as a whole, must retain the confidence of Parliament.The permanent Civil Service is integral to this complex patternAccountability.    The British Civil Service is non-political,account-to Ministers for its work, whether execution of policy or adviceolicy.   Ministers have to rely on the expertise and loyalty ofr Departments for most of the continuing functions of Government,they may also rely on the impartiality of their senior officialse policy advice is concerned.   Advice is also sought and receivedoutside Departments, but that from officials forms an important[sus for  kg actions of successive administrations.Under our constitutional conventions civil servants have forpost part been anonymous, offering advice in confidence and[e free to express tentative views on alternative policies. TheyloBBaitted to exposing even uncomfortable facts or aspects of alion in order to present as full a picture as possible of anI&apos;  But at the end of the day it remains Ministers who decide*h and remain accountable to Parliament for its broad outlinesfxecution.
CONFIDENTIAL \Govftrnment in the United KingdomAs has been said the keystone of the constitutional arrange-8 in this country is individual and collective Ministerialountability to Parliament.   And this means that Ministers have to(vide information about the exercise of their responsibilities iner that an account can be rendered to Parliament.    Over the years,ferent mechanisms have been developed for the disclosure offormation including Parliamentary; Questions, Adjournment andInly Day Debates, Command Papers presented to Parliament, evidenceISelect Committees and the legislative process.   There are too the&apos;orts to parliament of the C &amp; AG- and PCA, independent office-Iders who, in the discharge of their responsibilities have specialjess to Departmental information.Parliamentary conventions have been established governing theclosure of information by Government to Parliament which havepgnised that a balance must be struck between the legitimateirements for Government, as of any other organisation, to havertain degree of privacy for the proper and effective conduct ofbusiness and the need to ensure that Parliament has the informa-which it requires to scrutinise the Executive and to holdsters to account.    These conventions are under continuouselopment and in recent years governments have made much morerraation available than hitherto through the Parliamentaryanisms mentioned above.    In particular an increasing amount of)rmation has been provided by Government in written and oralwnce to Select Committees.Moreover this Government and earlier Labour administrationstaken major initiatives to provide the context within which10 debate can take place on major policy areas.

A letter was sent on 6 July 1977 by&apos;d Croham (then Sir Douglas Allen, Head of the Civil Service) toids of Departments intended to secure the release of backgroundserial wherever possible.ThiB Information Directive said that the working assumption injure&amp;ould be that background material relating to policy studiesreports would be published unless Ministers decided that it wouldbe; that the aim normally would&apos; be to publish as much as possiblethe background material, subject to Ministerial decision, onceyhad Been the study and reached their conclusions on it; andt when policy studies were being undertaken in future the backgrounderial should as far as possible be written in a form which wouldrau it to be published separately, with the minimum of alteration,ministerial decision to do so had been taken.   The effects tor of this policy initiative by the Government have been detailed11-it-^r i. t-ri ft

They would welcome access to documents in theIcision-raaking stage in order to participate and assess for them-lelves the adequacy of the advice being given to Government,[formation obtained in this way would often be in advance of thatrailable to Parliament, and,can be used capriciously orsstructively.    In varying degrees many other countries have such aiblic involvement, but jn no country, whether there is legislativewision or not, are working papers available.   Participation inich circumstances can be in many ways equated with existingrticipation in the United Kingdom where interest groups affectedproposals are consulted as part of the decision-taking process.&apos; There are those too who would welcome a fuller release of papers&quot;er a decision has been taken in order to consider the adequacy ofe arguments for and against that decision.    Such scrutinyaiitionally falls to Parliament, but greater availability offormation would lead to better-informed criticism among the public*arge, and better appreciation of the factors to be taken intopint.To meet these criticisms of present practice a wide range ofsures have been proposed.    In v/hat follows, possible approaches0n two opposing principles are discussed.    Variations on eachPemcan be envisaged but regardless of differences of detail,essential distinction lies between schemes which build onPting arrangements for Ministerial responsibility to Parliament^oSe which are based on treating access to information on policyN as a matter of law enforceable by the Courts or by some0lal &quot;quasi-judicial&quot; machinery.1978, House of ^Hansard vol 9^0 cols 2^^02m
, Paragraphs 31 and 32 above have referred to the increase ine volume ol mxoraiaaon published by the Government in recent years1 the attempt (under the Information. DirecTTTveT) to achieve alical increase.    It must be recognised that in the initialriod there has so far been limited success, but there areriking examples of the potential of such a policy.   Windscalemonstrated how the normal inquiry procedures could be developedallow for widespread public debate on a matter of criticalblic importance in the area of nuclear waste, disposal. Nationald international aspects were argued thoroughly.   The publishedport was widely discussed and by introducing a Special Developmentder to authorise the project under the Planning Acts, the Governmentabled Parliament to express its views in two debates. Similarlye siting of the US Tanker Base at Fairford was given comprehensiveverage in the document specially prepared - Deployment of the USr Force KC 135 Tanker Aircraft in the United Kingdom - and the&quot;S Report of the Review Team on Supplementary Benefits is the firstin public participation and consultation on policy in this area., There is no doubt that more can be done to secure the aims ofe Information Directive.   Departments can improve the arrangementsich they make for replying to enquiries for background informationd for assembling information in response to them.   More Departmentsprepare and make available on request - as some do already - anflex under appropriate headings of departmental subjects showingat material has been published, what is available on request, andcan be expected (eg material in course of preparation, regularturns with the dates when they are produced), together with aleral statement of individual departmental practice.- In conjunction with this list, all Departments might offer a^ice through their libraries which would supply copies of materialsted in the index, or alternatively provide access to them on theemises.   The libraries could also, on suitable occasions, referhirers to the appropriate departmental officials for information^rent issues which was not available on library papers.&apos; Arrangements on these, lines would also better equip DepartmentsJMfie the nature and extent of the demand for additional informationthemost appropriate means of presenting it.13
CONFIDENTIAL3Nevertheless, although this would represetrt-welcome improve-s to the present system, -it remains.a fact that a primefficulty in making available background studies under theformation Directive is that under present practice the factuald analytical material required as a background to policy formula-on and decision making is generally not prepared as a separatecument, but is interwoven with the argument and advice which isknitted to Ministers.    It would be possible to increase the volumeavailable information relating to policy decisions but only ife system were changed.   A measure which would represent abetantial advance on the Information Directive would involveceptance by the Government of an obligation to .publish, or makeilable on request, information on the background to majorlicy decisions.Though all policy decisions are founded on information as toe facts, and an appreciation of the options available, there isjpically no single document or set of documents which could be saidconstitute the factual and analytical material underlying aticular decision.    The information and the appreciation may bef fused, interspersed v/ith argument or advice, over a range ofcuments and oral exchanges perhaps covering a long period. Butere no suitable document existed it would be possible to compile,r publication or disclosure on request after the decision has beenjOmulgated, an account of the supporting information and the factorsW led to it.    Information given in this form would be more likelyincrease public understanding of the background to decisions than&apos;p release of any one document or set of documents on the file. Thewould be to release information that did not fall withinjCOgaised exceptions.j Such an extended information scheme could be regulated by aof practice promulgated by the Minister for the Civil Service.Code could cover the arrangements for seeking and providingonnation, the classes of information that would be excepted&quot;* disclosure, and the types of decision to which the scheme ofClosure typically related.   Particular attention would need to&amp;ven to the last.   Many thousands of decisions are taken dailyGovernunent Departments, but the object would be to provideH
CONFIDENTIALUrination concerning decisions of.ah importance that justifiesa Minister announcing them to Parliament or issuing a presstatement. -The exceptions to the obligation to disclosure would include[formation whose unauthorised disclosure would be an offence underrevision of the Official Secrets Act, but they would also encompassTtain other categories, including financial matters whoseiblication could be damaging (eg to the reserves or the exchange:te), matters of individual or commercial confidence, activitiesIere the government acts as if a private citizen, such as in thering, selling or production of goods, Cabinet and Cabinet Committeeoceedings and information involving the attribution of views orvice to individual Ministers, officials or Departments., Rather different considerations arise in dealing with demandsr the publication of manuals and guides dealing with theministration of major areas of legislation, particularly in theBxation and social security fields.   Much of this information oflurse should be available to the general public and indeed is alreadyprovided in other publications.    But there is also material whichffers guidance and advice to officials on such matters as thetection of fraudulent claims for benefits and the evasion of taxesd duties.   To make these parts of the internal manuals generallylilable would clearly be contrary to the best interests of thercunity at large.IS^JLLsht of Access &apos; &apos; &quot;Reference has already been made to public concern about thepsible misuse of personal data and the fact that the Governmentconsidering this issue separately.   Nevertheless the demand ofe individual that he should be able to satisfy himself as to thettual accuracy of information held on records such as thoseGained by schools, hospitals, and social service departmentst thereason why there are demands for a right of access to allSerial.    The suspicion that, public authorities (and someliVate bodies) hold information that could adversely affect theferesof the individual, his family, his property, hisla,l&amp;bourhood, and indeed the total environment in which he livesvyork8 means that the demand for access to personal data comes.    -       .

All have examined foreign experience, especiallyn Sweden and the United States, and have drawn heavily on varyingeatures in their Acts.

ni industrial matters, advice to Ministers and, to internalorldng papers.   The proponents of a public right of access seeknthis way to reconcile the need for.more openness with theecognition of the need for an appropriate degree of confidentialityQ cases where they believe it to be required.   This is especiallyo when dealing with the vast quantity of commercial-in-confidencenfonsation made available to government.   By far the largestount is made available to government on a voluntary basis, and anyiminution in the protection afforded such information would seriouslyffect its continued provision by companies and other organisations.0, The major advantage of a public right of access is basicallyhat those seeking information have the right to obtain what theyant when they want it, subject to clear exemptions, rather thanaving to wait on a government initiative or discretion to releaseterial.   The obligation and duty are clearlylaid on the Governmentd any refusal to comply with a request can be challenged in law.1, Would such a right in practice meet the aspirations of thoseho seek it?   To provide an answer entails some consideration ofhat constitutes the raw material contained in official files. Eachile is a collection of papers which can include memoranda, internalinutesj letters, drafts, agenda and accounts of meetings. Thefitters can include a great variety of correspondence - betweeninisters and between officials or with Members of Parliament,epresentatives of organisations outside government and individualWizens,,   All this written material can be formal or informal,pntative or repetitious.    Often the documents do not rehearse all theScents because the recipient already knows them.    Often theyResent-thinking aloud at a very early stage of the developmenta policy or proposal.    In any case, the history of how policy^de and implemented is not to be deduced solely from the files.e documents they contain are only some of the tools of policy-ft is thus very easy to misinterpret the material contained in0* especially if one or two documents are taken out of context.17
t the least, access only to such material will., provide a very.nc0l3plete picture of v/hat lead up to, a particular action orAt worst it will totally mislead.3, Prom the administration&apos;s point of view, the difficulties ofaiding access would vary according to whether such access was toconfined to documents written after the right was createdfollowing the practice adopted by other countries) or madeetrospective, (as proposed in the Official Information Bill)I, Files created before a right of access was created would containrange of documents, both classified and unclassified, relating tondividuals or containing material it would generally not be in theublic interest to reveal.    This material will have been compiled anditten without the knowledge of a right of access and may proveifficult to separate.    For example,. discussion of exchange contrololicy might contain examples of evasion, -where companies&apos; orndividual&apos;s names are included.    Even if blacked out those with;h knowledge and experience in this field can either deduce theorrect names or, worse, speculate about several names, with potentialtficult consequences for subsequent law enforcement. ExperienceBplications abroad, especially in America, has shown how difficultUs to be sure that exempted material is really protected whereartial access is involved.    Also, &quot;political&quot; arguments (fromatever perspective - national, party or departmental) are oftenPassed alongside &quot;factual&quot; points.    This system is the naturalrollary of the protection which internal communications haveftherto enjoyed, and for administrative purposes (whether insideGovernment Department or a private firm), it is far the moot(Wenient and efficient system.    To make material available underPublic right of access would pose considerable problems both ofhciple and of practice.&apos; pirst, all material falling within one or more of theTories of information exempted under the scheme would have toAmoved before the file was handed.over for inspection and that4i^e a formidable task, often involving decisions at a senior
evel.   This has proved a formidable task in&quot;thTunited States,there retrospection and the huge quantity of material has complicatedthat is seen in any case, on current files, as an exercise fraughtth interpretative difficulty, especially where definitions ofexemptions have to be tested in the Courts.    All Scandinavianountries acknowledge this area to be one offering some of thegreatest problems particularly where the courts have a major role,d where this results in rulings which are not always consistent!Then there is the matter of&apos; scale. &apos; One Ministry in Whitehall&quot;one has 3-4 million files in current use plus over 100 miles ofhelving in archives not yet released under the 30-year rule. OtherApartments can quote comparable figures.   Normally any one enquiryrould involve comparatively few files.    But the sheer volume of theterial now in existence and stored under the existing system wouldreate major problems for all departments in classifying, siftingnd making documents available.!?, Their   problems (and the additional staff and. expenditure) wouldshe great even for current cases; they would be unmanageable ifright of access were to be made retrospective.Moreover, there is a significant issue of principle entailed inltering retrospectively the character of a document.   Even whenjexempt&quot; material has been removed from a file, what-remainsliable for access will have been written by people who believedwere writing in confidence.   Such people would not only be civilervants.   There will be representatives of organisations orWpanies outside central government, or private citizens.   They are&quot;titled to consideration.5&apos; Aright of access confined to the future would involve extensive^ges in departmental procedures for record-writing and record-6ePing,   This of itself would not necessarily be a disadvantage,United States experience has shown, but it cannot be achieved^igut, and without enormous and costly rearrangement of the^nment machine.    But there are other, less readily identifiable^ts which could work against the public good.   No largeNation, public or private, can work effectively in full view19&apos; CO  .rIOENTIAL j
tke public.   Policy-making is impossible in a goldfish bowl,should not be surprising that those involved in decision-takingnil wish to preserve some privacy and will find ways of doing so.effects on the working of Government could be far reaching,linisters and officials may become less ready to commit theirhoughts to paper so that telephone conversations and unrecordedeetings (with their own attendant dangers) would tend to replacefitten correspondence.0, Greater openness in some respects might be matched bytiveness and inefficiency in others.    There would be onearticular disadvantage - where advice is now freely given by outsideindividuals and organisations in the knowledge that it remainsonfidential to the government, it will be less forthcoming in thelure.   This problem has been raised in the context of comraercial-Konfidence material (para 49) but the same negative effects willnevitably extend across to other fields of government activity,dvice is essential to government, but by having it publiclyvailable risks prejudicing its high quality, and almost certainlyfinishing its quantity.1i These considerations were well expressed in the report of theomraittee of Privy Counsellors on Ministerial Memoirs (the Radcliffeoramittee) published in January 1976 (Crand 6386).   The Committeeid:&quot;We asked ourselves very seriously the question whether, withall the pressure of the day in favour of openness of governmentand public participation in the formulation of public policies,the principle itself which enjoins confidentiality in all thatgoes to the internal formulation of government policy ought tohe regarded as an outmoded and undesirable restriction. Wealways came round to the same answer.    It is necessary and itought to be observed.The argument in its favour is quite simple and doe3 not gainhy elaboration..... Those who are to act together in pursuance0i a policy agreed- in common do require the observance ofconfidence as to what they say to each other; and unless.theycan be assured of the maintenance of that confidence they willnot speak easily or frankly among themselves.    Opinions, perhaps^popular, perhaps embarrassing, will be muted or suppressed ifthey are known to be liable to future disclosure at the whim ofBome retired colleague.    Business which should be discussed by20
I0ENT1AL-the whole body will tend t-o be settled by two or three in acorner.   Given oursvstem of Cabinet and Parliamentary government,the interests of the State will suffer if policy cannot be formedon a basis of mutual confidence.&quot;ut the committee said of Ministerial memoirs applies with equalLhVfcy..to any disclosure of exchange made - and rightly andH-essarily made - in confidence.21
(j2,  The schemes of public right of access, studied abroad havegiven individual members of the public a legal entitlement andfliey have imposed legal obligations on Ministers.    The courts havebeen given the task of resolving disputes about access as matters0f fact and law.    Decisions, for example, as to whether particulardocuments fell within an exempt category or not would be for legalinterpretation, and enforcement by a judicial process.   Many ofthe cases which have come before the courts in other countries haverequired a good deal of difficult interpretation, often inpolitically contentious fields.    Should the judgment in thesenatters be one for our judicial or for our political institutions?63,  There would seem to be a number of options available fornonitoring decisions by government on rights of access - account-ability to Parliament, creation of a special tribunal or office-holder, such as the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration,or the courts.    In monitoring applications by the public for accessto documents, where access has been refused, the courts would be insome difficulties.    In cases where access has been denied becauseof exempt matter, the reason why and the nature of the informationor documents sought to be withheld could not be revealed to theapplicant without defeating the object of the claim to exemption.Ordinary judicial procedure could not be followed in such circum-stances and a Judge would have to consider the material by himselfto private, without having heard full argument by both parties. Hewould be performing a role more of an executive than judicialcharacter, and could be called upon to determine broad politicalissues,   Whilst courts in other countries may be accustomed to thisrole, it is not one which the United Kingdom courts are used toassuming.^  It might be suggested that this problem could be resolved bybating a special tribunal or office for this purpose, or that an^sting body or office-holder, such as the Parliamentary^issioner for Administration, -might be given this jurisdiction.Madly the same considerations would apply, detailed in the22
r.&apos;CNTIAL1EOSneeding paragraph, in replacing political judgment with thejurisdiction of a specially created &quot;quasi-judicial&quot; body. Theribunal or office-holder would decide cases of dispute and wherepessary (independently of the view of Parliament) pronounceitrongly against the Ministerial decision.    It v/ould, as a;onsequence, be directly drawn into judgments in difficult and;ontroversial political areas.   For the Parliamentary Commissioner,Kbis would represent an entirely different role of a quasi-judicial character.    The procedures;of his office which, under the1967 Parliamentary Commissioner Act, are informal and designed tofacilitate investigations and not&apos;to make judicial interpretations,would have to be radically altered.    In fact, the PCA v/ould need toact more as a court than as an investigating office in support ofsrs of Parliament.Then there is the question of enforcement of rulings by eitherthe courts or a quasi-judicial body.   Where a body subject to thelegislation is not under Ministerial, control such a judicial processwould be appropriate to ensure its compliance with the law. Itshould not be necessary to make such an arrangement to compellinisters to comply and to do so would be contrary to normal practice23
CONFIDENTIAL 555, v/hether in these matters the judgment lay with the courts orKith a quasi judicial tribunal or office-holder, a public right ofaccess to information in general policy areas would represent asubstantial change in the existing constitutional arrangements inthis country.    Where government transactions directly affect theinterests of the individual citizen, the roles of the courts orquasi-judicial bodies of one kind or another and of the PCA,deluding jurisdiction over the production of documents by governmentin relation to particular cases, are well established.    It would bea constitutional novelty for this country if the provision ofinformation in general policy areas, with their considerableolitical content, were made a matter for legal or quasi-legaljudgment, rather than of accountability to Parliament.7. Under the alternative approach to increased openness discussedin paragraphs the responsibility for requiring Ministers toeet commitments to produce more information would rest entirelyith Parliament, through the exercise of its traditional role. Thearliamentary conventions governing disclosure of information byovernment to Parliament, referred to in paragraph      would natur-Hy have to reflect moves to increased openness and it would beor Parliament itself to consider whether.any changes in its ownrocedures would assist it in monitoring the implementation bynisters of their declared intentions on openness. &apos; These couldttclude a role for the PCA though this would present many of thedifficulties as are described in paragraphs andonsideration of these matters could perhaps be part of the furtherebate on the recent comprehensive report by the Select Committee onrocedure.i
.0!-:FIDENTIALConclusionAs this Green Paper has shown there are differences as to theapproach to be followed, and the methods by which greater opennessiS to be achieved.    There does not yet exist, even among advocatesof freedom of information, a sufficient degree of clarity orconsensus on the precise objectives to be achieved; hence thereare profound differences in the prescriptions of methods to beadopted.).  So there is a range of important questions to be considered,and there are differences of opinion about the answers.    The cost ofopen government provides an illustration.    None would deny thatgreater openness by any means is costly, although opinions differi . -v costpmLfcjii&apos;&apos;.&apos;-ii&quot; &apos;&quot;&quot; i     ;&quot; &apos;.s.*,as to the cost of any given approach.    But the Government at anyrate cannot shirk the fact that extra money and staff for therelease of information can only be made available if they arediverted from some other use.    Public expenditure is necessarilyunder constraint, and any decision to spend more involves adifficult choice between priorities.   More information means lessfor something else.). If there were sufficient agreement on approach &quot;and methods, noioubt resources, both staff and money, could and should be found forprogress towards greater openness, though resource cpntraintsggest that a gradual approach may be called for.    Quite apart fromthose considerations, however, there has not yet developed asufficient degree of agreement as to which of the various approachesto greater openness is best adapted to the British system offilamentary democracy.    The freedom of information systems thatVe been developed in other countries have to be seen in thetontext of the constitutional arrangements of those countries, andfoeir relevance to our situation must be examined in the light ofTerences between those constitutional arrangements and our own..s is of particular importance in considering the role played by^Courts in other countries.    In our constitutional system theernment is in Parliament: members of the Government are almost
invariably Members of Parliament; it is to Parliament that Govern-ent is accountable; it is to Parliament that the Government comesf0r legislative sanction for its policy decisions; it is inarliament- in the first instance that the Government explains anddefends its actions.   An approach to greater openness that does notespect these fundamental features of our system - and indeed otherfeatures, such as the collective responsibility of Ministers andheir relationships with their civil servants - will underminerather than strengthen British Parliamentary democracy.71, While so much remains for discussion and clarification, theovernment is not prepared to sign&apos;a blank cheque on the method andapproach to greater openness: in particular, it is not prepared toenter into any commitment on- access to documents.2. But some things are. already clear, and on some matters progressand should be made.    There is general agreement that thelanket coverage of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 hasoutlived its usefulness.    It is not disputed, however, that someinformation requires the protection of the criminal law against&quot;authorised disclosure.    There is broad agreement on the categories^be protected, and the form which statutory protection should take,ihe Government1 s proposals for new legislation in this regard v/ereout in the White Paper of July 1978*.    There can be and areTerences of opinion on detail; but the time is now ripe to bringlllis matter to a legislative conclusion, on the general lines of the,f&apos;ite Paper.    This remains, in-the Governmenfs view a necessaryCursor to greater openness.-This Green Paper has sought to summarise the present state ofjte debate on the approach to greater openness and the method to beflowed, and in particular the arguments for and against anrPproach based on making openness in policy areas a matter of lav/1th11 a public right of access and on the other, an approach based11 Pariiamentary surveillance of Government commitments to the issuef nuiler and freer provision of information..If &apos; &quot; &apos; - ie orm of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911.   Cmnd 7285.
The Government hopes that.the Green Paper, together with theebate on the Committee Stage of Mr Freud&apos;s Freedom of Informationill, will provide a basis for further public discussion which willead to a greater degree of certainty and consensus on theseuestions.   In the meantime it will continue, - within the limits ofesource constraints, to increase the volume and range of informa-ion made available to Parliament and the public, as a contribution3 the improvement of the trust in Government on which the effective-ess of our administration and the health of our democracy alikeepend. &quot;J
ANNEX B*PROPOSED CODE OF PRACTICE(1) It is essential to the effective working of a democraticsociety that the public should be adequately informed aboutthe actions and decisions taken by the Government and otherorgans of public administration of the United Kingdom. Theparamount criterion should be that the public may, by beingadequately informed, have the opportunity of understandingand evaluating the nature of, and the reasons and grounds for,such actions and decisions. Accordingly, with certain necessaryexceptions, all documents containing information on suchmatters should, so far as is reasonable and practicable, bedisclosed within a reasonable time to any person requestingtheir disclosure.(2) This Code of Practice applies to all government depart-ments and other authorities to which the ParliamentaryCommissioner Act 1967 applies.(3) Servants of the Crown and other officers and personsresponsible for disclosing information in accordance withthis Code should disclose sufficient information to satisfy thecriterion stated in paragraph (I).(4) Documents will not be disclosed if:-(a) the case falls within paragraphs (9), (10) or (11) be-low; or(b) there are reasonable grounds for believing that thepublic interest would be adversely affected by dis-closure.With these exceptions, documents should be disclosed wherethe information they contain relates to decisions on mattersof policy or to other acts or decisions (whether of an executiveor quasi-judicial character) of any authority to which thisCode applies. Information relating to any matter on whicha decision has not yet been reached should also be disclosedunless disclosure is likely to prejudice consultation ornegotia-tion with persons or bodies directly affected by the ultimatedecision, or to affect the outcome adversely to the publicinterest: in either of these cases there will be no disclosureuntil a decision is reached.16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL(5) In determining whether or what disclosure should bemade it is immaterial that the person requesting disclosureis or is likely to be in dispute with the government depart-ment or other authority from which disclosure is sought. Onthe contrary, all practicable assistance in the form of generousdisclosure should be given to any such person since disputesor misunderstandings may well arise from misinformation orinadequate information. So far as is practicable, all infor-mation should be disclosed which might be of advantage to&apos;the person requesting disclosure, either with a view to re-dressing a wrong or which could be helpful in understandingthe reasons for a decision.(6) No regard shall be had to the nature of the applicantsinterest in seeking disclosure.(7) Any complaint of failure to disclose a document or classof documents which ought, in accordance with this Code, tohave been disclosed shall be treated as a complaint of mal-administration at the instance of the person requesting dis-closure and, if he claims to have sustained injustice inconsequence thereof, his complaint may be investigated bythe Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in accor-dance with the provisions of section 5 of the ParliamentaryCommissioner Act 1967.(8) Arrangements shall be made within every governmentdepartment and other authority to which this Code appliesfor the preparation and publication of a document inordinary language giving information about the documents orclasses of documents which, or copies of which, will be dis-&apos;closed in accordance with this Code; as to the persons respon-sible for dealing with applications for disclosure, and as tothe charges, if any, which may be made.(9) Documents containing information relating to matterslisted below shall be exempt from disclosure to the extentthat they contain such information, so that there shall bedisclosure of that part of the document which contains noreference to or indication of matters which may not bedisclosed. There will be no disclosure of information:-(a) relating to defence, foreign relations or internalsecurity;(b) relating to law enforcement;17CONFIDENTIAL
(c) Which could be privileged ;igainst disclosure inlitigation;(d) entrusted in confidence to a government depart-ment or other authority to which this Code applieswhether or not required by or under any enactmentto be disclosed to any such department or authority;(e) the disclosure of which would infringe the privacyof an individual;(f) which, if disclosed, could reasonably expose theperson disclosing it to a significant risk of pro-ceedings for defamation. .(10) Cabinet and Cabinet committee documents as a class areexempt from disclosure.(11) There will be no disclosure of any document which corn-prises advice or comment tendered by any person in thecourse to his official duties to a Minister or servant of theCrown or other officer of an authority to which this Codeapplies to the extent that the document contains such adviceor comment.18CONFIDENTIAL
