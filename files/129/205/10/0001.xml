SECRET g \JMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 1013 February 1979CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND CASH LIMITS 1979-80Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. Pay settlements so far this round have averaged about 11 per centand given normal drift it is difficult to believe that the final earnings outturnwill be lower even if we succeed in reversing the current trend.    It is notyet possible to estimate the extent of the final excess over the Government&apos;sguidelines, or the implications for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement(PSBR).    We should be better able to assess this by the time of the Budget,and we will not be able to decide until then the full scale of the fiscaladjustments this will require.    But we need to make a clear statementbefore the end of this month about the basis on which cash limits will beset in relation to pay settlements and their impact on inflation.THE BASIS OF CASH LIMITS2. For cash-limited expenditure by central and local government westart from the White Paper plans and the present formula for fixing cashlimits, which provides for pay settlements in the current round of 5 per centplus  3. 50 underpinning plus prior commitments for the armed forces andothers in the public services (producing around 7 per cent average inearnings), and 8j per cent price increases.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE OTHER THAN PAY3. I propose that for the non-pay element in central government andlocal authority cash limits we hold to the present formula.4. How large a generalised volume cut this will imply will depend onwhat happens to prices, which in turn depends mainly on what happens topay.   Even if the average price increase were as much as 12-13 per centreflecting a 15 per cent earnings outturn, which is a pessimistic assumption,the generalised volume squeeze in this area would not go beyond 4 to 5 percent.    This would be difficult in many cases, but should in general befeasible: a volume squeeze on this scale occurred, and was absorbed, onnon-pay expenditure in 1976-77.    To the extent that the price increase islower, the volume squeeze would be smaller.1COPY NO     g qSECRET
SECRETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE: PAY5. How we deal with the pay element in Rate Support Grant (RSG)will have to depend on the development of the various local authority paynegotiations and will best be settled in that context.    We have said so farthat the cash limit would be increased to cover the Government1 s share ofthe  3. 50 underpinning;  and that we would also finance our share of an8,8 per cent offer to the manuals.6. For the pay element in Central Government expenditure, someincreases in cash limits will be unavoidable if the relevant pay settlementssignificantly exceed the present formula.    My proposal, which has beendiscussed at official level with the Civil Service Department, is that weshould be prepared in due course to increase the pay element in cash limitsby 2 percent less than would be needed to accommodate fully whatever paysettlements in excess of the guidelines are eventually reached, with theproviso of course that the cash limits would not be below the level requiredto finance a settlement within the pay guidelines.7. This would imply a cut of up to 2 per cent in the planned level ofCivil Service manpower costs.    The Civil Service Department have pointedout that a volume cut of up to 2 per cent in Civil Service manpower, spreaduniformly over all Departments, will cause a deterioration in the standardof service, for example in the prisons and the administration of socialsecurity, and is likely to provoke strong staff reaction. . However, giventhe growth of the Civil Service over recent years, I find it hard to believethat a 2 per cent saving should result in the deterioration feared.    In anyevent there should be no need for redundancies, the savings being achievedby normal wastage.    The position would be made more difficult to hold ifthe manning levels of the rest of the public services were left untouched.OTHER ACTION8. Any exceptions to the uniform application of the squeeze on non-payexpenditure in so far as prices go above the average 8jr per cent, or of the2 per cent squeeze on manpower costs if the relevant pay settlementsexceed the guidelines, will mean that either the Department concerned willhave to find the difference from its other programmes, or that otherDepartments will have to bear a greater reduction.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES9. If the growth of earnings in the nationalised industries significantlyexceeds the guidelines and the industries&apos; borrowing were to be held withinthe aggregate of the provisional cash limits in the White Paper, larger andearlier (or second) price increases would be needed to offset the effects ofhigher inflation on their costs, though this option will not be available forthe industries whose prices are set by competition in the market.Provided we accept that the necessary action should be taken, I do notProposed now specific expenditure cuts to cover an increase in the2SECRET
SECRETindustries&apos; borrowing.    But we should note that even if borrowing is held inthis way, there is likely to be considerably less shortfall on nationalisedindustries&apos; borrowing than the  550 million previously assumed.    This willpush up the PSBR and will in due course need to be offset.OTHER FISCAL CONSEQUENCES10. The approach outlined above will imply increases in the cash limitsin respect of the pay component.    This, together with the increases now inprospect in public expenditure not covered by cash limits, may requiresome further offsetting action to avoid increasing the PSBR.    As indicatedabove, it is not possible to make a final assessment at the present time,but we cannot rule out the possibility that some specific public expenditurecuts may have to be considered.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS11. I ask my colleagues to;-i.    decide that the non-pay components of central Governmentand local authority cash limits should be held to the levelspreviously planned;ii.    agreed that the central Government pay component of cashlimits should be increased by up to 2 per cent less than would benecessary to accommodate the full cost of settlements in excessof the present guidelines (subject to the proviso that theGovernment will finance fully settlements within the guidelines);iii. note that our policy on the pay element of the RSG will haveto be further considered in the light of the development of therelevant pay negotiations;iv. agree that we announce our firm intention to manageexpenditure within cash limits set on the basis proposed;v.    agree that nationalised industries should so far as possiblerecover higher costs within 1979-80 through additional priceincreases in order to stay within the White Paper provision andthat Departments should now work out the options for doing so onalternative hypotheses about the outturn of earnings.12. If this approach is agreed, we should announce our policy forthwith.J BH M Treasury!3 February 1979 3SECRET
