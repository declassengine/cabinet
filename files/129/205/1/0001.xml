CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 1 COPY NO8 January 1979CABINET80SPECIAL EMPLOYMENT MEASURES 1979-80Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceand Paymaster General1. At their meeting on 17 October (CM(78) 35th Conclusions, Miaute 3)the Cabinet agreed that the proposed Bill for a short-time working compen-sation scheme should be deferred and that alternative measures shouldoperate from 1 April 1979 with the aim of achieving at least the samereduction in unemployment as the statutory scheme would have done(estimated at 100, 000).    They also agreed that up to  230 million could bemade available if suitable measures could be identified.2. The Ministerial Group on Unemployment amongst Young People(GEN 27) have substantially agreed a package of measures proposed by theSecretary of State for Employment which should reduce unemployment by over300, 000 in March 1980.    This compares v/ith the target of 290, 000 we set forMarch 1979 though we shall do v/ell to reach 230, 000 by that date.    Without aprogramme in 1979-80 on this scale it is only a matter of time on presentforecasts before unemployment goes up again.3. The makeup of the package is set out in the Annex.    GEN 27 werehowever uaaole to reach full agreement on two elements - the Job ReleaseScheme (JRS) and the Small Firms Employment Subsidy (SFES).JOB RELEASE SCHEME4. This scheme enables workers within a year of pension age to leavework early provided they are replaced by a person from the unemploymentregister.    It is our only measure which operates directly on labour supplyand is on target to make an impact of 24, 000 on the unemployment registerthis year.    The allowance payable will be updated from 1 April 1979 to 31. 50 for a single person and  40 for a married person.    It is not taxed.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. GEN 27 are agreed that some expansion of JRS in 1979-80 is essentialand that this must be achieved by lowering the age of eligibility.    But we wereunable to agree on the new age levels or on the principle of whether theallowances should be taxable - if the allowances Were extended to cover twoyears or more they would be taxed unless we provided otherwise bylegislation.6. As to the eligible age GEN 27 considered that the choices were to movefrom the present ages of 59 for women and 64 for men to one of the following -	Eligible Women	ages Men	Impact on unemployment register	Cost in 1979-80  m*	Cost of package 1979-80  m*a.	59	63	49,000	48	203b.	58	63	60,000	58	3 214c.	59	62	66,000	64	/? 223*A11 these figures also assume an extension of the scheme to disabledmen aged 60 or more.Views were evenly divided between a. and c.    In both these cases no changewould be made in the age of eligibility for women but we thought that this wasdefensible given the lower National Insurance (NT) retirement age for womenand the much higher incidence of unemployment amongst men and theexpectation of life.    We would not expect any objection from the EqualOpportunities Commission;  there is a risk that to go to 58 would appear asinconsistent with any move towards equalising the pension age between mena%d women and might create a misleading impression of the prospects for areduction in the retirement age for women.    On the other hand lowering theage for men but not for women would require legislation and could provokecriticism from women themselves.    As regards men, some of the Groupfelt that to reduce the age of eligibility by two years rather than one yearrepresented too big a step forward at this stage, particularly as we onlyexpanded the scheme from the Assisted Areas to the whole country from1 April 1978.    The Secretary of State for Employment strongly favoursoption c. and regards option a. as unacceptable because of its lower impact onunemployment which he considers would have to be made up through other lesscost-effective measures.    His second choice would therefore be option b.7. GEN 27 agreed that if the allowances were to be taxed because theywere payable for two years or more they would have to be grossed upaccordingly so that on average the net value remained unaffected. TheSecretary of State for Employment argued strongly against taxation on the2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALgrounds that the additional complexity would materially reduce the scheme&apos;sattraction and hence its effectiveness and that short-term benefits generallyare not taxed.    He also notes that there are already some benefits likeinvalidity allowances and war widows&apos; pensions which are exceptions to thegeneral rule that long-term benefits are taxed.    On the other hand to allowJRS allowances to be tax-free when long-term benefits are taxed would beinequitable and could well increase the pressure to make such benefits, eg NIretirement pensions and widows&apos; pensions, tax-free.    To make JRSallowances payable for two years or more tax-free would require 3egislationand, if this were agreed, the Secretary of State for Employment would intro-duce a short Bill early in-ther-ncxt-Scosion^ /^^a. -c/^^v. ,SMALL FIRMS EMPLOYMENT SUBSIDY8. The SFES is designed to encourage the creation of additional employ-ment in small firms by providing a subsidy of  20 a weak for six months foreach extra job created.    It has been considerably expanded in scope since itwas introduced in July 1977 and from 1 January 1979 will apply to manufacturingfirms of less than 200 employees throughout the country and, subject to thesame size limit, to non-manufacturing firms in the Special Development Areas,Development Areas and Inner City Partnership Areas.    A strong body ofopinion within GEN 27 supported the principle of a further extension to covernon-manufacturing firms in Intermediate Areas also.    This would take afurther 9, 500 off the unemployment register at a gross cost in 1979-80 of 28 million.     There are strong regional policy grounds for extending thescheme in this way.    But it would be expensive.9. The cost of extending SFES and of wider eligibility for JRS could justabout be met within the overall limit of  230 million set by the Cabinet for thepackage as a whole provided that the least costly of the JRS options weretaken (the estimate for the total package would then be  231 million).    But ifone of the other JRS options were agreed then the SFES expansion could onlybe accepted if Cabinet approved a higher coiling, or changes were madeelsewhere in the package (which GEN 27 do not recommend).    The Secretaryof State for Employment would strongly prefer to go for a major extension ofJRS rather than SFES because it is surer and more cost-effective.TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT SUBSIDY (TES)10. The impact of TES has fallen off markedly and it is virtually certainthat any further extension would not be approved by the European EconomicCommunity Commission.    We do not propose this.    Instead we recommendthat a non-statutory short-time working compensation scheme and arestructuring assistance scheme should replace TES.    The non-statutoryscheme will pave the way for the statutory scheme which cannot be broughtinto operation much, if at all, before April 1980.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSION11.        I invite colleagues to decide -a. the scope of an extension of the JRS (paragraphs 4-7);b. whether the SFES should be extended to Intermediate Areas(paragraphs 8 and 9);and to endorse tho rest of the package of employment measures for 1979-80 asact out in the Annex.S WDepartment of Education and Science8 January 19794CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL. ANNEXSPECIAL EMPLOYMENT MEASURES 1979/801. At mid-November the Great Britain total of unemployed - at1.33 million was over 100,000 lower than the year before despite somefalling off during the year in the total effect of the specialemployment programme; and school leavers have fared better this yearthan last.     The main features of the prospect for next year are -- a further rise in the demand for labour in the first half ofnext year for women in the services sector, with manufacturingemployment and male employment possibly declining;- the labour supply could increase by about 180,000 over theyear, two thirds of them women;- a high number of long term (over one year) umemployed atpresent standing at 330,000, nearly one quarter of the totalunemployed;- on current growth forecasts it could be only a matter of timebefore the present decline in unemployment gives way to arising trend, particularly if special employment measures arenot renewed beyond March 1979-Looking beyond next year unemployment is likely to remain high in themedium term.2. The measures endorsed by GEN 27 broadly fit the prospective patternof unemployment over the next year, with special provision for the groupsparticularly hard hit by high levels of unemployment - young people andthe long term unemployed.     About 1+0 per cent of the impact is throughprovision of work experience or training opportunities, nearly1j CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALii. Introduction of a new restructuring employment subsidy.These two schemes would replace TES and together should reduceunemployment by about 55,000 by March 1980.iii. Extension of eligibility for the Job Release Scheme (JRS)Effect dependent on which of the options is adopted by the Cabinet.iv. Extension of Small Firms Employment Subsidy (SEES). Thisscheme is already due to be expanded from 1 January 1979 to covermanufacturing firms countryside and non-manufacturing firms in theSpecial Development Areas,Development Areas and Inner City PartnershipAreas.     Further expansion to cover non-manufacturing firms inIntermediate Areas is dependent^on the Cabinet decision.3.      The programme at A and B above would reduce the unemploymentregister by upward of 300,000 by April 1980.k.     In addition studies are in hand of programmes to assist thelong-term unemployed including the experimental adult employment subsidy.Replies are expected in April and July 1979.3CONFIDENTIAL
