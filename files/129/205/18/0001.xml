CONFIDENTIALPCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT80CP(79)1813 March 1979COPY NOCABINETNOVEMBER 1979 UPRATING OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. In their memorandum CP(79) 19 the Secretary of State for SocialServices and the Minister for Social Security propose a number of improve-ments in social security benefits.    These improvements are additional tothose which will derive from the statutory uprating, on which, as theyindicate, final decisions cannot be taken until there are firm forecasts ofearnings and prices over the 12 months to November 1979.2. I have discussed the proposals for additional improvements with theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Minister for Social Security.Their cost amounts to  242 million in 1979-80 and  611 million in a full year,on top of the cost of the statutory upr^ting, and this additional amount couldonly be met from the Contingency Reserve.    It therefore goes tc accentuatethe difficulties which we are faced with in current circumstances, and for thisreason we cannot accept these proposals in full.3- Provided the modifications I suggest below are made, I am preparedto accept the proposals on the correction of shortfall ( 80 million in 1979-80arid  190 million in a full year) and the lone parent premium ( 2 million and 6 million).    On two other items:-i. I am opposed in principle to providing a margin over the pricesforecast for November 1979 short-term benefits uprating ( 10 millionand  25 million).    We shall make an honest estimate of the Novemberon November price movements and we should stick by it, and not seekto build in an assurance which can only cast doubt on our own figures.In any case, if we make good the 1978 shortfall, there is no case for amargin.ii. We considered last year the proposal relating to the long-termscale rate ( 30 million and  90 million) and whether we should makelong-term rates of benefit available to all recipients of supplementaryallowances after one year instead of two, as well as extending thesearrangements to the unemployed.    This matter does not require an1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALimmediate decision, since it is not directly related to the question ofuprating social security benefits.     The Secretary of State for SocialServices should if he wishes bring it forward in the context of anormal public expenditure survey.4, Finally there are the proposals for improvement in child benefit( 120 million and  300 million).    Child benefit is an extremely expensiveitem.    There are strong pressures for further increases, not least theParliamentary situation, but I am not convinced that it is necessary now to goto 60p as proposed.    In my view we should hold the increase to 50p, whichitself represents a substantial increase in real terms over the  4 which thebenefit reaches in April, and will be seen by the public as such.    To go to60p would cost us an additional  20 million this year and  50 million in a fullyear, and this spending is not justified by reference either to the merits of theadditional lOp, or to the credit we would get in the country from going that bitfurther.5. My suggestions would cost about  60 million less in 1979-80 and ]65 million less in a full year than would the Social Services Ministers1proposals.    At a time of great pressure on public expenditure, when difficultdecisions are going to have to be made, my view is that we should proceedwith the uprating proposals in the form I have described above;   and that anyadditional credit we should get from going down the more expensive pathwould not justify the additional cost.    Our record on pensions and childbenefit is an extremely good one, and will still remain so if the SocialServices Ministers&apos; proposals are modified as I suggest.treasury Chambers12 March 19792CONFIDENTIAL
