CONFIDENTIAL /?&quot;VS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 2-8COPY NO28 March 1979CABINETPAY OF SCHOOL, FURTHER EDUCATION ANDUNIVERSITY TEACHERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education andScience and Paymaster General1. The financial proposals in the Chief Secretary&apos;s memorandum(CM(79) 27) and the state of play in pay negotiations make it necessary forme to bring the question of teachers&apos; pay to Cabinet.    This paper seeks toreflect the Scottish situation, but the timetable has precluded my presentingit jointly with the Secretary of State for Scotland.SCHOOL TEACHERS2. On 21 March, the Burnham Primary and Secondary Committeefailed to reach agreement either on the 8 per cent offer for this year or ona Standing Commission reference.    The 8 per cent was rejected because itwas not 9 per cent or 10 per cent rather than because it was not the36. 5 per cent of the teachers&apos; claim: it is now fully accepted by the teachersthat we are discussing the staging of a relativity or comparability exercise.3. The Management Side made it clear that the claim for the restorationof Houghton relativities could only be considered in the sense of aStanding Commission reference.    The Teachers1 Panel made equally clearthey would prefer to continue to negotiate in Burnham, but spontaneouslysuggested a delay until 4 April which would allow the Management Panel toproduce clear answers to important questions, particularly on staging andthe handling of Houghton in the terms of reference.    So far as the teacherswere concerned, the object of any exercise would be to reaffirm theHoughton relativities.4. The Scottish teachers have similarly rejected an 8 per cent offer -and unlike teachers in England and Wales have had a one day protest strike.Their consideration of the Standing Commission issue is less advanced, butthey can be expected to take the same line as teachers in England and Wales.They next negotiate on 2 April.5. If we are to avoid breakdowns on 2 and 4 April (with the EasterConferences of the main unions fast approaching) offers will have to bemade covering the three following elements: -1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALa.,       Terms of reference for the Standing Commission studywill have to be tabled, in which the handling of the Houghtonin sue will be critical.h        A firm offer will have to be made on staging, relatedto what v/e offer to the Civil Service; andc,      it will be essential to have authority, to be used ifnecessary to avert breakdown, to improve marginally on the8 per ceat offer, jay to 8  per rent,6. The local authorities have consistently made clear that they expectthe Government to pay their share through Rate Support Grant (RSG) of anyoffer that they agree should be made in the circumstances of eachnegotiation.    We have so far promised RSG support for the 8 per centoffer already made.    In order to maximise the likelihood of theManagement Panel&apos;s being able to make further offers that will clinch anagreement and keep the tsachers away from arbitration, I suggest that weextend this promise to the 8^ per cent at paragraph 5c. above should thatauthority be used07. The staging that can be agreed with the teachers continues to dependcritically on what we offer to the Civil Service.    Subject to how that maydevelop, I am at present of the opinion that the Management Panel nextweek should offer a first stage at 1 April 1980, falling back to 1 January 1980if necessary in the course of negotiation:   with the date of the second stageleft for subsequent negotiation well into the 1980-81 financial year but notlater than January 1981.    It will again greatly enhance our chances ofsecuring a settlement if R.SG support can be promised for the cost of anystage paid before the end of the 1979-80 financial year.8. On paragraph 5a. - the terms of reference - urgent discussions areproceeding.    Agreement will not be easy to reach with the local authoritiesbecause they favour a very general Standing Commission report followed bysubstantive negotiations and are prepared to see a (critical) reference toHoughton.    There is a high risk that the English and Welsh teachers willhave recourse to arbitration if Houghton is not referred to in the mainterms of reference, though we shall of course try to persuade them toaccept something less.FURTHER EDUCATION (FE) TEACHERS9. The Burnham FE Committee meets on Thursday 5 April.    They havea comparable claim for the restoration of relativities and colleagues haveagreed that they should be referred to the Standing Commission.    Both inequity and in order to avoid arbitration, they should be treated on all fourswith school teachers, including RSG backing.    Indeed, FE teachersemployed by local authorities in Scotland are covered by the same negotiat-ing machinery as school teachers and have therefore already received an8 per cent offer.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALUNIVERSITY TEACHERS10. University teachers should receive the same treatment as FEteachers, particularly because we are still only in mid-course ofrectifying a 1975 anomaly which put them at a serious disadvantage inrelation to FE teachers for a number of years.    Any substantial differencebetween the FE and university settlement in this pay round would call intoquestion our undertaking to rectify that anomaly.    For the future, the rightcourse would be for the university teachers also to be considered by theStanding Commission, as provisionally agreed by the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)) earlierthis week.11. Unlike the local authorities, the universities are almost whollyfinanced by the Exchequer through the University Grants Committee andhave no other source of income to call on.    Consistently with my minute of26 March to the Prime Minister; I cannot agree that they should suffer the2 per cent volume reduction in their programme which the Chief Secretaryproposes in respect of pay settleirients for their teachers (and technicians),provided these are within the limits we are accepting for RSG support in thecase of the local authorities.RECOMMENDATIONS&quot;12. I make the following recommendations to my colleagues:-a. School, FE and university teachers should received thesame offers (from 1 October 1978, their anniversary date, inthe last case) together with comparability studies.b. For all three groups, staging should be as in paragraph 7above;  and financial support for this as in paragraphs 7 and 11.c. I should have discretion to increase the 8 per cent offer(already made to the school teachers) to 8-1 per cent with fullfinancial support if necessary to secure an agreement in eachof the three cases.S WDepartment of Education and Science28 March 19793CONFIDENTIAL
