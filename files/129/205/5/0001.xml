FOURTH REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEEON THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERFOR ADMINISTRATION(REVIEW OF ACCESS AND JURISDICTION)SESSION 1977-78Observations by the Government1. The Select Committee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Adminis-tration in their Fourth Report for Session 1977-78* have recorded theconclusions of their review of methods of access to, and the jurisdiction of,the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.2. The Commissioners office was created by the Parliamentary CommissionerAct 1967. In the period since then the office has developed from almostexperimental beginnings to become an important part of the constitution ofthis country. It is now a powerful and effective instrument in support of Membersof Parliament in safeguarding the individual citizen against injustice arising fromdefects in administration by the executive. This development of the office issubstantially due to the efforts of successive Commissioners and their staff,and also to the support provided by successive Select Committees on theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration. The Government wish totake this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the Commissioners and alsoof the Select Committee.3. The Government agree with the view of the Committee that, after thepost of Commissioner had been in existence for over ten years, and against thebackground of some criticisms of the system, it was appropriate, to review themain features to see whether changes were required. The Government thereforewelcome the Committee&apos;s Fourth Report. Their observations on the Committee&apos;sconclusions as summarised in paragraph 39(a) to (o) of the Report are set outbelow.(a) There is no need for.direct access to the Commissioner as an alternativeto the revised system of indirect access introduced in 1978 (paragraphs9-10)4. The Government agree with the Select Committee&apos;s conclusion. Inparticular they share the Committee&apos;s belief in relation to the affairs of centralgovernment that &quot;the principle on which the 1965 White Paper was founded that the primary responsibility for defending the citizen against the executiverests with the Member of Parliament is still valid&quot;. They note the change inthe procedure for dealing with complaints sent direct to the Commissionerwhich was proposed by him in his Annual Report for 1977, and was endorsedby the Committee in their Second Special Report for 1977-78f, and whichshould go a long way in assisting members of the public in the handling of theircomplaints.*HC615.tHC296.2
(b) The parliamentary convention which in general inhibits Members fromtaking up their colleagues&apos; constituency cases should be interpretedflexibly where the reference of cases to the Commissioner is concerned-       (paragraph 11)-5. The Select Committee note that Members are usually prepared in casesof this kind to respect the complainant&apos;? wishes. Although this must remain amatter for Members, the Government see force in the Committee&apos;s conclusionand trust that the convention will continue to be interpreted flexibly.(c) . The link between. Parliament and the Commissioner should bestrengthened by increasing the contacts between Members and theCommissioner and by making Members more aware of the Commissionerswork (paragraphs 12-13) ....    . .6. The Government agree with the Select Committee&apos;s conclusion. Theyendorse the emphasis placed by the Committee on the parliamentary basis ofthe Commissioner&apos;s. work, and commend to the House the Committee&apos;s viewthat measures, should, be taken to increase contacts between Members and theCommissioner. They note that in paragraph 13 of their Report the Committeedraw to the attention of the Select Committee on House of Commons (Services)a proposal that the Commissioner should have an office within the Palace ofWestminster.(d) The reports of the Commissioner and of Your Committee should bedebated in the House at least once a year (paragraph 13)7. The Government do not consider that thepurpose of the Select Committeein recommending this course &quot;to focus Members&apos; attention on the Com-missioner&apos;s work&quot;-would be best served by regularly setting aside parliamentarytime, whether or not there were current issues which warranted priority overother business of the House. However, the Government agree that there shouldbe appropriate opportunities for Parliament to consider important individualcases, and general matters relating to the work of the Commissioner, as theneed arises.(e) The Commissioner should make more frequent occasional reportsunder section 10(4) of the Act (paragraph 14)8. While this is not primarily a matter for the Government, they do notdissent from the Select Committee&apos;s conclusion.. (f) The Commissioner should be able to investigate complaints by Britishcitizens about assistance requested from consular offices and overseasposts, including complaints by British citizens resident abroad (paragraphsi8-i9) X%;^r.. V^?.&apos;r&apos;; .&quot;&apos;. &apos;&apos;-&apos;.&quot;-79. The Government accept that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&apos;sproposal to extend the Commissioners jurisdiction only to the statutory func-tions of career consular, officers overseas in order not to impinge on mattersaffecting relations with other Governments was not wholly satisfactory in thatthe area of exclusion was too wide.3
. 10. They are therefore prepared to accede to the Select Committee&apos;s wishesin this regard and agree to extend the Commissioners jurisdiction to includethe non-statutory as well as the statutory duties of such officers. This changecould be achieved by an Order in Council, under Section 5(4) of the Act, makingan appropriate amendment to Schedule 3 of the Act.11. The Government are also prepared to consider whether the Com-missioner&apos;s jurisdiction should be extended to cover complaints by citizens ofthe UK and Colonies travelling or resident abroad, provided that the actioncomplained of was taken in respect of a citizen who has the right of abode inthis country (ie a patrial). Such an extension would require primary legislationamending Section 6(4) of the Act.12. The Government believe that these extensions of the Commissionersjurisdiction should satisfactorily meet the Committee&apos;s concern.(g) The Commissioner should be able to investigate complaints aboutmatters relating to contractual or other commercial transactions (para-graphs 23-24)13. The Government believe that the Parliamentary Commissioner systemshould operate in the field of the relations between the executive and thosewhom it governs. They do not consider that it would be in the general interestto extend it to transactions where the relationship is of an essentially commercialnature, such as in the buying of goods and services, or that the commercialactivities of departments should be open to examination by the Commissionerwhile other contracting parties are free from such investigation.14. The Government acknowledge that in the area of their assistance toindustry the dividing line between transactions which are subject to theCommissioners jurisdiction, and others which have been ruled to be &quot;contractualor other commercial&quot; within the meaning of Schedule 3, is a difficult one.Nevertheless, the Government take the view that a distinction should continueto be drawn between statutory powers which are so exercised that persons havea prima facie expectation of receiving benefits on terms which they themselvescan usually predict, and statutory powers which are so exercised that a widemeasure of commercial discretion is involved and the terms on which benefits(if any) are granted are specially settled for each application.(h) The Commissioner should be able to investigate complaints aboutpublic service personnel matters, except complaints from serving civilservants and members of the armed forces about discipline, establishmentsquestions, and terms of service (paragraphs 25-28)15. The Government have again carefully considered this recommendationto alter paragraph 10 of Schedule 3. In their reply* to the Select Committee&apos;sReport for 1976-77, the Government gave their reasons in detail for the exclusionof personnel matters relating to civil servants currently employed by theGovernment, to those who had retired, and to applicants for Civil Service posts.* Cmnd. 7098, paragraphs 4-5.4
The Government continue to hold the view that the means of redress availableto intending or former Crown servants are in no way inferior to those availableto workers generally, and that it would not be acceptable for this group to havethe right, not available to others, to invoke the intervention of the ParliamentaryCommissioner. As an employer, the Government always seeks to be as fair asany other employer in dealing with complaints from employees, and this appliesjust as much to former or intending employees as it does to those currentlyserving the Government. The Committee are referred to the previous explanationof the means of redress available. The Government believe that similar con-siderations apply in the case of the armed forces.(j) No change is needed in the definition of &quot;maladministration&quot; (paragraph29)16. The Government agree with the Select Committee&apos;s conclusion.(k) The Commissioner should draw Parliament &apos;s attention to any unforeseeninjustices resulting from legislation (paragraph 30)17. The Government believe that where the Commissioner finds a complaintto relate to the content of legislation, rather than to maladministration, he isalready free to say so. However, as the Select Committee make clear, it isimportant to avoid any suggestion that &quot;the Commissioner might act as aconstitutional court attempting to override Parliaments decisions&quot;. It is forParliament to consider whether legislation requires amendment, and it is opento Parliament, if it so wishes, to take note of any relevant findings of theCommissioner based on his examination of complaints from members of thepublic which he has investigated.(/) The Commissioner should be able, subject to Your Committee^approval, to carry out inspections of branches or establishments of bodieswithin his jurisdiction (paragraph 31)18. The Government note the Select Committee&apos;s rejection of investigationby the Commissioner in the absence of direct evidence of possible maladministra-tion; but that the Committee suggest that he should be able to extend the scopeof his enquiries &quot;if, for example on the basis of complaints which he hadinvestigated and upheld, the Commissioner had reason to believe that a particularbranch or establishment. . . was not dealing efficiently with its business...&quot;.The Committee think the Commissioner should be able, subject to their approval,&quot;to carry out a systematic investigation of all aspects of the work of the branchor establishment in question, with a view to identifying the cause of the problemand making recommendations for putting it right&quot;.19. This would represent a significant change in the nature of the Com-missioner&apos;s role which the Government believe would be both unnecessary andundesirable. It would place a heavy burden on the Commissioner if he wererequired in effect to &quot;audit&quot; the administrative competence of governmentdepartments and would distract him and his staff from their central purpose ofinvestigating individual complaints. However, where the Commissionerinvestigates a series of complaints relating to a particular area of administration,he is, as a result of his normal investigations, able to form a clear view of the5
procedures in force there and to, make any; recommendations which he sees fitin consequence. Any, lessons to be drawn from investigations by the Commisrsioper are already studied by departments and acted upon. In the nature of thepresent system of access to the Commissioner, the. complaints which heinvestigates tend to be substantial ones. Section 10(2) of the Act provides thatin all cases the Commissioner shall send a report of the results of his investigationto the Principal Officer of the department concerned. The department is thusin a position to consider whether the act of maladministration was an isolatedone,, or whether it discloses wider deficiencies. The. Government believe that itshould be for Ministers and their departments to decide what action is necessaryto prevent further maladministration by a particular branch or establishment,aryjto fee, answerable, as:may be,-necessary:, to Parliament for the adequacy ofthe action which has been taken to this end.(m) All Crown bodies should be subject to the Commissioners jurisdictionvunless:: explicitly excluded-(paragraph 32) ., . , ,:.20. Section 4 of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 provides thatthe,government: departments;and. otherauthorities listed in Schedule 2 of theActshall besubjectto the;Commissiorier!s jurisdiction. In the Select Committee&apos;sview,. the scope of the Commissioners jurisdiction should be defined byexclusion rather than inclusion: iejievery administrative, action taken on behalfof  the Crown should be within jurisdiction unless expressly excluded. TheyObserve *hat &quot;potentially investigable: bodies may inadvertently be omittedfrom&apos;the Schedule as a result of changes in the machinery of government&quot;.21. The Committee in their Report do not, however, recommend anysubstantive change in the coverage of the Act, and the Government do notconsider that a technical amendment of this kind, which could also give rise toComplications, is necessary. However, they note the Committee&apos;s concern andundertake that, where changes in the machinery of government are underconsideration, particular attention will be given to any change which may affectthe Commissioner^ jurisdiction.(n) The Commissioner should have the right of access to Cabinet papers,except where the Attorney General certified that such access would be&apos; prejudicial to the safety of the State or otherwise contrary to the publicinterest (paragraph 34)22. The Government have carefully considered the views of the SelectCommittee. However, in more than eleven years since the Act came into forcethere has been no case in which the Commissioner has indicated that any of hisinvestigations were less than complete because of ;the relevant provision in theAct. This includes the Court Line investigation, to which paragraph 34 of theCommittees Report refers. The Committee accept that cases where the Com-missioner might consider such access to be,necessary would be very rare, andthere is no evidence to suggest that the present arrangements will give rise to any.difficulties for the Commissioner in the discharge of his responsibilities. TheGovernment therefore believe that there is no need to change section 8(4) ofthgjAot.-,,    jjjagj : suoUiist&apos;&apos;     Imti&amp;a &apos;M to ftoi n .* :b - s t6

In their consideration of the First Report for Session 1977-78 from theSelect Committee on Procedure*, which makes recommendations about acomprehensive new structure of Select Committees, the Government will takeaccount of the views expressed by the Select Committee on the ParliamentaryCommissioner for Administration in their present Report.*HC 588-1.Printed in England for Her Majest/s Stationery Office by Harrison &amp; Sons (London) Ltd.27464&apos; Dd 254801 &apos; K16 ^7*
