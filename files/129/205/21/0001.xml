CONFIDENTIALXUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTonCP(79) 21 COPY NO19 March 1979CABINETINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceand Paymaster GeneralBACKGROUND1. The White Paper on Industrial Democracy (Cmnd 7231) was publishedin May 1978.    The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament in November1978 indicated an intention to legislate in the current Session.    Officials havereported to the Ministerial Group cn Industrial Democracy (GEN 86) on themain issues to be settled before a Bill can be published and the Group&apos;sconclusions are set out in Annex A.2. The White Paper Indicated that the Government wanted to encourage thedevelopment of industrial democracy on a voluntary basis.    But to cater forcases where it was impossible to make satisfactory progress by agreementthere should be two statutory fall-back rights.    The first was to provideemployees through Joint Representation Committees (JRCs) with a right todiscuss all major proposals affecting the employees before decisions are made.The second would provide for employee representation on the Board.Employee representatives could have one-third of the places.    The right toBoard representation could not be triggered by the JRC until three or fouryears after the JRC had been established.3-        The White Paper adopted a basically single-channel approach at andbelow Board level but offered important safeguards to ensure that arrange-ments were properly representative.    On the question of selection of Boardrepresentatives the White Paper put forward optional approaches without firmcommitment.    The foundation of its proposals was the JRC which would&quot;trigger&quot; both rights.    All the independent recognised unions within acompany would be entitled to belong to the JRC which would have to be&quot;broadly representative of the independent recognised trade unions in thecompany which in turn would be broadly representative of the employees as awhole&quot;.    It follows from the White Paper approach that the statutory rightswould not exist in companies where unionisation is not sufficiently developedto allow the formation of JRCs,CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRESPONSE TO THE WHITE PAPER4, A summary of comments received is at Annex B,    Immediate responseto the White Paper appeared favourable, at least by comparison with theBullock majority report.    However the consultations that followed revealedstrong opposition.    Whilst industry has expressed general support for theprinciple of increasing employee participation it wants a voluntary approachsupported and encouraged by a Code of Practice.    There is virtually unanimousopposition on the part of industry to legislation for statutory fall-back rights onthe lines proposed in the White Paper.    There is a solid line-up against the&quot;single channel&quot; whether for the selection of directors, or in the form of atrade union monopoly for the JRC.    It is argued that the proposals for fall-back rights are incompatible with the Government&apos;s stated preference forvoluntary development;  and that they will damage existing non-union-basedparticipation arrangements and inhibit further voluntary developments.Opposition in principle to the proposals in the White Paper has made itimpossible so far to have constructive discussion with the major companiesconcerned and the Confederation of British Industry on the important questionof their application in groups and multinationals.5. On the trade union side for the most part individual unions have notcommented.    The Trades Union Congress have broadly welcomed the WhitePaper but stressed that any derogation from the single-channel principle at orbelow Board level would be unacceptable, on the grounds that it would bedivisive and devalue the JRC.    They are concerned at the &quot;protracted time-table&quot; implicit in the White Paper before the right to Board level represents -tion comes into effect, particularly since parity of employee/shareholderrepresentation was not proposed.6-       It is clear from the response to the Whits Paper that the difficulties infinding an acceptable statutory basis for progress remain as formidable asever.    The damage done to the standing of the trade union movement in recentweeks has intensified the problems.    Any legislation for industrial democracyalong the lines of the White Paper is bound to be strongly opposed both insideand outside Parliament.    Apart from those who are against legislation in anyform the strength and nature of the opposition will turn largely on how wehandle the single-channel issue, both in relation to below Board levelParticipation - the right to discuss Board strategy - and Board membership.THE RIGHT TO DISCUSS&apos;       GEN 86 are agreed that the right to discuss corporate strategy shouldthiV6Sted exclusivelv in the JRC, as proposed in the White Paper.    Its role inba S COntext *s essentially a development of collective bargaining and should beaased on trade union structures.    We agree also that as the JRC alone will have^statutory right to consultation the legislation needs to include specific testsensure that the JRC is representative.

CONFIDENTIALa. Be open to appeal to the Industrial Democracy Commission (IDC)not only by independent recognised trade unions but also by groups ofemployees whether or not trade unionists (we have in mind an appealfcr groups numbering at least 10 per cent of the workforce).b. Be subject to a validating ballot of the whole wo-rkforce.THE RIGHT TO POARD REPRESENTATION8. We have identified two broad options.    Under each of them the JRCwould have the responsibility for devising a scheme for choosing employeedirectors.    But under the first (Option A) the JRC would have a free hand,subject to certain statutory safeguards, to decide the basis of the schemewhereas under the second (Option B) the scheme would have by law to be basedon elections of directors in which all the workforce would be entitled to vote.We describe the main features of Option A and the safeguards we propose inparagraphs 17-21 of Annex A.    But the majority of us feel that this Option doesnot adequately reflect the democratic princip?e and accordingly favour themandatory electoral approach set out in Option B (paragraphs 22-26 ofAnnex A).    We have not worked up either Option in detail at this stage andthis is particularly true of Option B;  which seems likely to require morecomplex legislation.9. The choice between the two Options is a critical one.    The case forOption A - which is basically a single-channel approach - is that the arrange-ments for industrial democracy should be consistent with the establishedsystem  of collective representation in British industry.    The case forOption B - mandatory elections - is that every employee has a right to bedirectly involved in choosing those who are to represent him.    The tradeunion movement will oppose mandatory elections.    They will tend to detractfrom the authority of the JRC.    Employers may see it as less objectionablein principle, but it will impose a lot of unwelcome work on them. Theelectoral approach is however more likely to be acceptable to the Oppositionand minority Partie s in the pre sent Parliament.    Neither approach canprovide any guarantee that minority interests will be adequately represented.PUBLIC SERVICESI0-       Fall-back statutory rights and the duties of the IDC to give rulings etcin relation to these matters would be restricted to the private sector and thenationalised industries.    GEN 86 recommend that the promotional role of theDC should however extend also to the public services.    But the Lord Privyeal believes that the promotional role should not apply to the Crown and localgovernment (Annex A, paragraph 28).3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSIONS11,       I invite the Cabinet to endorse the main recommendations of the Groupas set out in their report at Annex A, namely -i. That legislation on fall-back statutory rights should be confinedto registered companies and nationalised industries (paragraphs 2 and35).ii. That &quot;Fringe Bodies&quot; should generally be excluded. Considera-tion should be given to an exemption procedure for fringe bodies whichare registered companies (paragraph 4).iii. That further consideration should be given to whether thelegislation should apply to Northern Ireland (paragraph 5).iv. That statutory fall-back rights to discuss company strategyshould be vested in the JRC (paragraphs 6 and 12).v. That all independent recognised trade unions in the companyshould be eligible for membership of the JRC (paragraph 7).vi. That to ensure that the JRC is genuinely representative it shouldbe subject to the safeguards set out in paragraph 8.vii. That the legislation should establish criteria by which the IDCwould judge whether a JRC was representative (paragraph 10).viii. That the independence of an employee&apos;s organisation, ifchallenged, should be e stablished by the Certification Offic&amp;r, and itsclaim to membership of a JRC should beheld up until the question wasresolved;  the ballot to trigger the right to Board representation shouldnot be held until all appeals to the Officer had been resolved(paragraph 11).ix. That the right to Board representation should be exercisablethree years after enactment of the legislation (paragraph 14).x. Before the right to Board representation could be exercised therewould need to be a ballot of the whole workforce and an affirmative votefrom at least one-third of those eligible to vote and one-half of thosevoting (paragraph 15).xi. That employee representation be on the top tier of a two-tierstructure, or on a unitary Board, at the discretion of the presentBoard (paragraph 27).4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALxii. That a separate IDC should be established by statute, as a non-Crown body, not subject to Ministerial direction with the functions andduties set out in paragraph 28.xiii. That there should be special arrangements to safeguardconfidential information on the lines of Section 18 of the EmploymentProtection Act, with safeguards to cover particularly sensitive items(paragraphs 29-31).xiv. That there should be no additional provisions to cover disclosureto or by employee directors, and that there shculd be no criminalsanctions to prevent disclosure by the JRC (paragraphs 32 and 33).xv. That there should be a statutory right of appointment by Ministersof employee directors selected by the workforce to the unitary mainBoards of nationalised industries, without any right of veto(paragraphs 34-37).xvL   That the question of consumer representation on such Boardsshould be considered separately (paragraph 37).xvii. That GEN 86 should be asked to consider further the treatment ofgroups and multinationals (paragraphs 38-41).12.       I also invited the Cabinet to resolve the major and fundamental questionof whether our proposals for choosing employee directors should follow abasically single-chanael approach (Option A in our report) or the approachbased on mandatory elections (Option B) (paragraphs 8-10 above and Annex A,paragraphs 16-26);   and to settle the following subsidiary points -a. Whether there should be the possibility of an appeal by 10 percent or more of the workforce on the question of whether the JRC wasrepresentative and whether there should have to be a ballot of theworkforce to confirm that the JRC was representative before it couldexercise statutory rights (paragraph 7 above and Annex A,paragraphs 8 and 9).b. Whether the IDC should have a right to intervene, before thevalidating ballot, if not satisfied with the JRC&apos;s scheme for choosingemployee directors (whether based on Option A or B) (paragraph 7above and Annex A, paragraphs 21 and 25).c. Whether or not the promotional role of the IDC should extend tothe Crown and local government (paragraph 10 above and Annex A,paragraph 28).CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE WAY AHEAD13. There is no prospect of ensuring a majority for legislation in thisParliament.    GEN 86 believe that work on the preparation of legislationshould however continue.    As regards our public stance the options are -a. Say nothing for the present and make appropriate reference in duecourse in the Manifesto.b. Make a public statement shortly of our intentions in the light ofour consultations on the White Paper.c. Piblish a further White Paper.d. Append to the White Paper a draft Bill.e. Publish and introduce a Bill into Parliament (if decisions aretaken now it might still be possible to produce a draft Bill by July).14. The majority view within the Group favour b. or c. , the latter beingappropriate if the Government proposed to adopt the electoral approach forBoard membership.    Such a proposal would break new ground and it would beright to spell out our intentions in some detail.    But the Secretary of State forEmployment would like to publish and introduce a Bill, in line with the under-taking in The Cueeii&apos;s Speech last November.15. I invite the Cabinet to decide on our next steps on our plans forindustrial democracy, in the light of the options in paragraph 13 above.S WDepartment of Education and Science19 March 19796CONFIDENTIAL
(confide ntIal)o UANNEX AINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY LEGISLATIONREPORT BY MINISTERIAL GROUP ON INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACYSummaryIn the light of the response to the White Paper the Grouphave reviewed the report by officials on the policy contentof legislation for industrial democracy.   This report setsout their conclusions on the main issues.Scope of the Legislation2. The White Paper proposed that the industrial democracylegislation should provide a statutory fall back right todiscuss company strategy in registered companies employing500 people or more and a right to board representation incompanies employing 2,000 or more.   This would excludeundertakings such as trustee saving banks, friendly societies,building societies and partnerships as these were notcompanies though most insurance companies and banks would becovered.   Both the CBI and the TUC would prefer that thelegislation should be restricted to registered companies atleast as a first step.   GEN 86 consider that, despite theanomalies, the legislation for fall back rights should belimited to registered companies but, as envisaged in theWhite Paper (paragraph 46;, these rights should extend alsoto the nationalised industries (see 35-38 below).3. The White Paper (paragraph 42) said that while theGovernment wished to avoid exemptions it would &quot;examine thearguments in the few cases where special considerations maybe thought to apply which might justify exemption from therequirements of the legislation on board level representation&quot;.Exemptions from the right to discuss were unlikely.   GEN 86have noted that so far arguments for exemption or specialtreatment have been put forward by only a few sectors. Thesewill need to be considered individually in due course.4*   &quot;Fringe bodies&quot; generally will, like the public serviceas a whole, be outside the scope of the legislation.   But ahandful are registered companies and consideration willhave to be given to an exemption procedure for these andother anomalous cases (eg the London School of Economicsand the Inner London Polytechnics) in categories which wouldgenerally be outside the scope.-1-
(confidential)5. The White Paper proposed (paragraph 56) that thelegislation should apply to the United Kingdom as a whole.The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland sees problems inextending the remit of the Industrial Democracy Commissionto Northern Ireland and would prefer to delay theapplication of the legislation to Northern Ireland.   GEN 86see strong grounds for the legislation &quot;being on an UnitedKingdom basis.   The question is currently under discussionwith the Northern Ireland Office.Composition of the Joint Representation Committee6. The policy of the White Paper (paragraphs 8-10) was toencourage the voluntary development of participationarrangements.   Where employees were unable to securesatisfactory arrangements by agreement the legislationshould provide for statutory fall back rights to be vestedprimarily in the Joint Representation Committee (JRC). TheAttorney General has subsequently expressed concern aboutthe propriety of drafting legislation in terms of creatingduties of consultation and disclosure whilst providing noremedy for breach other than the right to complain to astatutory IDC for an investigation and report containingrecommendations.   Together with the Attorney General, theSecretaries of State for Employment and Trade are consideringurgently the scope for providing an appropriate statutoryremedy.6.   The White Paper proposed (paragraphs 11 and 12) that allthe independent recognised trade unions in the company shouldbe entitled to belong to the JRC, which would have to be&quot;broadly representative of the.independent recognised tradeunions in the company which in turn should be broadlyrepresentative of the employees as a whole&quot;.   GEN 86 endorsethe White Paper proposals.8.   It will be for the unions within each firm to take theinitiative in establishing a JRC.   To ensure that the JRC canproperly claim to be representative GEN 86 consider that -a. the employer should be able to appeal to theIndustrial Democracy Commission (IDC) on the groundsthat the JRC was not representative;b. any independent recognised trade union should be ableto appeal to the IDC on the ground that the JRC wasnot representative of the independent recognisedtrade unions;c. the IDC should have a power to investigate wlaetheTJ%not a JRC was representative in cases where there abeen no statutory appeal (it could therefore P?-c]c pcases where non-statutory representations had beenmade to it).-2-(confidential)
(confidential)9. The majority of the Group would also want to providethat -d. any group of employees forming 10 per cent or moreof the workforce could appeal to the IDC on the0 ground that the JRC was not representative of theworkforce as a whole;e. the claim of a JRC to he representative should hevalidated by a ballot of the whole workforcesubject to a simple majority.10. GEN 86 agree that the IDC should be able to prevent aJRC taking up its statutory rights until it was satisfiedthat it was representative but.should not be able to imposeits own solution.   It would reach its decisions in the lightof qualitative criteria provided in the legislation whichcould include quantitative factors.   But the Group rejectedany idea of providing any quantitative formula in the Billitself.11. Any employees&apos; organisation claiming membership of theJRC as an independent recognised trade union should, ifchallenged as to its independence be required to obtain acertificate of independence from the statutory CertificationOfficer.   Its claim to membership of the JRC would be heldup pending the decision of the Certification Officer. Butthe JRC should -not be able to trigger the statutory rightto Board representation until all outstanding appeals hadbeen decided.The right to discuss company strategy12. GEN 86 consider that this right should be vestedexclusively in the JRC.   They agree that, as proposed in theWhite Paper (paragraph 9) the right should cover all majorproposals affecting the employees of the business.The Right to Board Representation13. The White Paper proposed (paragraphs 20-28) that whereprogress could not be made by agreement a statutory fall backright to Board representation in companies employing 2,000or more could be triggered by the JRC three or four yearsafter the date of establishment of a JRC.   The JRC wouldhave the right to ask the company to hold a ballot of thewhole workforce on the question of Board representation.If the vote was in favour the JRC would be able to appointup to one-third of the membership of the Board. Thelegislation would enable the company to choose whether theywanted employee representation to be on the top Board in acwo tier structure or on an existing unitary Board.-3-(confidential)
(confidential)14. GEN 86 consider that the link proposed in the WhitePaper between the date of the establishment of the JRC andthe right to Board representation would tend to push unionstowards a statutory JEC based approach to below Board levelparticipation with the possibility of disrupting satisfactoryexisting arrangements and that where progress was made on avoluntary basis on below Board level participation thiswould be, in effect, a penalty to early statutory moves toBoard representation.   GEN 86 therefore consider that thelink should be broken.   The majority of us think that theright to Board level representation should be exercisablethree years after enactment of the industrial democracylegislation.   An alternative would be to provide for a fouryear period (though the TUC have in their comments expressedconcern at the &quot;protracted timetable&quot; for Board representation).15. GEN 86 recommend that where a JRC wishes to move tostatutory Board representation this step should require anaffirmative vote of the whole workforce on the basis proposedby the Bullock Report (those in favour should constitute atleast one-third of those eligible to vote and one-half of thosevoting).16. Wherebe for thedirectors.(Option A)subject torequire itworkforce.there is an affirmative vote, the next step wouldJRC to draw up a scheme for choosing employeeGEN 86 identified two broad approaches.   The firstwould leave the JRC free to devise a scheme,certain safeguards and the other (Option B) wouldto base the scheme on elections involving the whole17-   Under Option A, following a period of discussion betweenthe JRC and the company about the detailed arrangements forBoard level representation, the JRC would devise and promulgatea scheme for selection of employee directors.   The JRC mightdecide on nomination, elections through internal unionsprocedures, or some other method.18. A right of appeal to the IDC against the JRCs schemewould be provided -a. for independent recognised trade unions;b. any group of employees forming at least 10% of thetotal workforce represented by the JRC.-19. Appeals would be decided against the basic criterionthat the selection procedure should be fair in thecircumstances.   The IDC would be required to have regard to (factors such as the geographical distribution of the company semployees and the extent to which the scheme took account 01the interests of different occupational groups.   In the eventof a successful appeal the IDC could delay the implementationof Board level representation until the JRCs had produced anacceptable scheme but it would not have power to impose a-4-(confidential)
(confidential)solution.   There would be no appeal against an IDC decisionother than through the normal process of judicial review.The IDC would be required to produce, after consultation, aCode of Practice setting out the principles it would apply-in considering appeals.20. As a final stage there would be a requirement for avalidating ballot of all employees, to be decided by a simplemajority, on the terms of the scheme proposed by JRC.21. The majority of the Group would also like the IDC tohave a right to intervene whether or not appeals were madeto it, as we have proposed also in relation to the questionof the representative character of the JRC.    The right tointervene would lapse once there had been a ballot result infavour of the JRC&apos;s scheme.22. Under Option B, after a ballot had concluded in favourof Board representation, the JRC would devise a scheme whichwould be required by statute to provide for election ofemployee directors.23. All employees would be able to vote in a secret ballot.GEN 86 consider that the legislation would require that theresults should be based on a &quot;first past the post&quot; system,and that as a general rule there would have to beconstituencies.    It would be for the JRC to draw upconstituencies in the light of statutory criteria. Therewould have to be rules for nominating candidates which shouldnot be limited to union members.   Whilst the JRC, inconsultation with the company, would draw up the schemewithin the statutory framework the actual organisation andconduct of the election would have to be the employers1responsibility.   There would need to be statutory powers ofenforcement where a company did not co-operate.24. There would need to be rules - perhaps in thelegislation or in subordinate legislation (statutoryinstruments or IDC Codes approved by Parliament) on a rangeof other detailed matters eg election expenditure, sponsorshipof and facilities for candidates, paying for electionarrangements.25. GEN 86 envisage that, as under Option A, there shouldoe rights of appeal against the election scheme proposed bythe JRC, by independent trades unions and &quot;others&quot; (as inParagraph 18 above).   There would also need to be a right ofappeal against misconduct of the election.   As under&quot;Ption A, most of the Group would like the IDC also to havea right to intervene whether or not an appeal had been madet0 it.   There could also be a validating ballot of the wholeworkforce before the JRC&apos;s scheme was implemented but thisaoes not seem essential under this Option.-5-(confidential)
(confidential)26.   Pending a decision on which of these two Options tofollow GEN 86 has not explored either in the full detailwhich would be necessary before legislation could be drafted.This is particularly so in the case of Option B, partlybecause the possibility of mandatory elections was notcovered substantively in the White Paper and has not been thesubject of consultation.   The application of either Option Aor Option B will present particular problems, which we haveyet to examine, in groups and multi-nationals (see paragraphsi&quot;5below).27-   We are agreed that the question of whether employeerepresentation should be on an unitary board or the top boardin a two tier structure should be at the company&apos;s discretionand that the legislation should provide accordingly. Thisremoves the possible ambiguity in the White Paper whichproposed that the employees should have a statutory right torepresentation on the top board in a two tier structure butthat the company should have the option of offeringrepresentation on an existing unitary board.
(confidential)Industrial Democracy Commission28. The White Paper (paragraphs 52-55) stated that theGovernment was disposed to accept the Bullock recommendationsto establish an Industrial Democracy Commission (IDC) butwould explore the matter further with the TUC, CBI, ACASand other interested parties.   It was clear from the con-sultations that an attempt to adapt the ACAS to carry outindustrial democracy functions would be unacceptable atpresent to all the major parties including ACAS.GEN 86 accordingly recommend the setting up of an IDC andthat the legislation should lay a general duty on the IDCto promote industrial democracy.   Except for the Lord PrivySeal, who wishes to exclude the Crown and local governmentservices, we think that this duty should cover the publicservices generally as well as registered companies andnationalised industries.   Its statutory duty to give rulingswould be limited to the private sector and the nationalisedindustries.   The IDC would be expected to use the ACAS formuch of its conciliation work.   The rulings of the IDC wouldnot be subject to appeal on their merits but there wouldremain the possibility of judicial review.   GEN 86 considerthat the IDC should not be subject to Ministerial directionand most of us, though not the Secretary of State forEmployment, consider that it should not be a Crown bodythough such a status would facilitate an eventual mergerwith the ACAS (which is a Crown body).   Codes of Practicepublished by the IDC should be subject to Parliamentaryapproval.Safeguarding; Confidential Information29. Thei White Paper recognised that the statutory duty todiscuss^company strategy needed to be qualified in respectof confidential information (paragraph 17) and that specialarrangements might be necessary to preserve certain types ofinformation disclosed by the company.30. The Employment Protection Act 1975 sets out (s.18)exemptions from the employers duty to disclose informationrelevant to collective bargaining and ACAS is required tohave regard to these provisions in its Code of Practice.GEN 86 recommend that industrial democracy legislation shouldfollow the same general pattern.7.(confidential)
(confidential)31. However in order to fulfil its obligation to discussmajor proposals, such as investment and product plans ormergers and takeovers, before decisions are taken acompany may need to disclose information public disclosureof which would be undesirable and which must be properlysafeguarded.   GEN 86 recommend that the obligation todisclose to the JRC commercially sensitive or price sensitiveinformation should be subject to adequate arrangements toprotect it being agreed (and put into operation; by thecompany and the JRC, with the JRC having a right of appealto the IDC if it considers the company is acting unreasonably.The IDC would draw up a Code on disclosure of informationtaking account of these principles.   To maintain consistency,the IDC should be free to refer an appeal to the CAC, thearbiter of similar cases under the 1975 Act.   It would be forthe IDC or CAC as appropriate to rule whether the companywas justified in withholding information.32. GEN 86 see no need for any specific statutory provisionabout the disclosure of information to or by employeedirectors.    All will have the same duties and responsibilitiesand will be subject to the present law as regards conflictof interest (ie they should not disclose information wherethis would be damaging to the company).33. All directors and employees would also be subject tothe general restrictions on insider dealing which the currentCompanies Bill would make a criminal offence.   GEN 86does not consider that disclosure of confidential informationby the JRC or its constituents should be made a criminaloffence.Nationalised Industries34. The White Paper proposed (paragraphs 43-46) that thelegislation would &quot;give employees in the nationalised^ industna right to representation on main Boards&quot; but that thisright would &quot;have to take account of the special responsibilitof the nationalised industries to Ministers, and through them,to Parliament&quot;.35. GEN 86 are agreed that the statutory right to discussshould also apply in the antionalised industries as m tneprivate sector.    The option of a two tier board structureshould be restricted to the private sector so that in tne8.(confidential)
(confidential)nationalised industries the fall back right to representationwould apply to existing main boards.36. In the private sector the appointment of employeedirectors by the JRC will be an automatic procedure.    In thenationalised industries the appointments will be madeformally by the appropriate Secretary of State.   We haveconsidered whether Ministers need to retain any specialsafeguards over the appointment and dismissal of employeedirectors on the Boards of nationalised industries. Itcan be argued that the public interest (including specialconsiderations of security) require that Ministers shouldretain a vote over appointments of employee directors andshould have a right to discuss such directors.   But thiswould contrast sharply with w&quot;^ht we propose for theprivate sector despite heavy criticism from employers andthe large majority view within the Group was againstany special safeguards.   Provision of such safeguardswould be particularly difficult if there was a requirementfor the election of employee directors.37. We have also considered whether, at the same timeas providing for employee representation on the Boardsof nationalised industries, we should also provide forspecific consumer representation, at least in thosemonopolistic industries directly serving the public.We see the case for providing in these industries forsome counter-balancing consumer representation.   We do notthink this should be provided through the industrial democracylegislation but we recommend that officials should giveconsideration to whether the advent of industrial democracyrequires any strengthening of the consumer voice withinthese industries.groups and Multi-Nationals38. ^ Groups and multi-nationals represent a major sectorof industry in the United Kingdom. Most large companiesoperate through a group structure and many are subsidiariespf overseas companies or have substantial overseas operations.J-he Bullock Report (Chapter 2) found that 738 UK enter-Prises had over 2,000 employees and commented that &quot;virtuallyall these enterprises are in fact groups of companiesorganised in pyramids of holding and subsidiary companies&quot;,paragraph 4, page 6).    No analysis was undertaken for the&quot;to companies in the range 501 - 2,000 employees but itseems reasonable to assume that many of those at thetoP end of the range would also have a group structure.9.(confide ntjal)
(confidential)39. Of the 738 enterprises identified by Bullock as employingover 2,000, 100 were subsidiaries of overseas parent companiesas were a further 154 of the 978 in the range 501- 2,000.The Bullock Committee also made a study of UK based companiesin &quot;The Times   1,000 1975-78&quot; and reported that of 624enterprises employing more than 2,000 people in the UK, atleast 320 had some overseas employees and at least 35,including some of the best known UK companies, had moreemployees overseas than in the UK.   They stressed that thesefigures were understated, (page 8, paragraph 8).40. The White Paper envisaged the right to discuss and toBoard level representation being available within enterprisesat whatever level discussions were taken and in all companiesincorporated in the UK where the number employed (aggregatedto include subsidiaries) met the thresholds.   But it alsorecognised the need to devise practical solutions for avoidingduplication and unduly burdensome arrangements.   In relationto UK based multi-national companies the White Paper noted(paragraph 40) the dilemma where British companies employsubstantial numbers of people overseas either directly orthrough subsidiaries.41. GEN 86 have not yet tackled the problems involvedin applying industrial democracy within groups and multi-nationals.   This has been partly because we thought itnecessary first to sort out the basic approach to industrialdemocracy and partly because of the extreme reluctance ofboth companies and the CBI to enter into constructivediscussion on what might be invloved.    GEN 86 will firsthave to consider how far there is a case for specialteatment and then invite officials to work up the possibilities]in detail.    It is desirable that any further substantivestatement of intent by Government on industrial democracyshould include definite proposals.10.(confidential)
WHITE PAPER ON INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACYCOMMENTARY ON REPRESENTATIONS RECEIVEDINTRODUCTION1   The White Paper on Industrial Democracy (Cmnd 7231) was published at the endof May.   It stated:&quot;The Government intends to consult widely on itsproposals bo as to achieve the greatest possibleagreement on the measures finally introduced. Wehope that all engaged in industry will discussthese proposals with the same objective&quot;.The White Paper also indicated certain specific matters on which thevemmenfs policy remained to be determined in the light of consultation: theethod of selection of employee representatives on the board, the treatment ofups and multi-nationals, the safeguarding of confidential information andhe question of possible exemptions.The Secretary of State for Trade invited comments to be addressed to him orhe Department of Trade, setting the end of September as the deadline.   The Queen1speech promised further consultations and these are continuing.To date the Department of Trade has received approximately 100 observationsn the White Paper from national organisations, representative associations,iiBB and individuals.   These include few representations from individuals&quot;lone or from people seeking to present the employees1 side.   To this extent,e impact of the representations received is somewhat unbalanced.The line taken by many respondents was predictable and in some cases istably a re-edited version of viewB already expressed in evidence to the Bullockl*ittee.   In others, however, the White Paper seems to have been given seriousfieideration on its merits, and the general impression is one of a careful andoaghtful response.^e generally favourable press reaction on the appearance of the GovernmenfsIs in May 1978 and the CWs views on the draft White Paper immediatelyore publication, are not reflected in the considered submissions subsequentlyved.  Most have been critical.   It may be that those who support the proposalsve i^8 IDot^va&apos;&apos;;ion to comment and that expectations of an autumn election mayB00uraged the opponents of the White Paper from making a more constructiveNOee, hut when all qualifications have been made the general response can beea up aB disappointing.THE TRADE UNION RESPONSEton      ***** Broadly welcomed the approach in the V/hite Paper, both in theirfhavgress resolution and in the General Council&apos;s submission. Nonetheless,ije^owe Pressed that any derogation from the principle of single channel atation x0ard level would be unacceptable.   The TUC have argued too that into the Joint Representation Committee (JRC) the statute should imposecreti n^Dm of conditions as to its representative character, leaving maximumin Ta&quot;0 the Indu8&apos;tr,ial Democracy Commission to decide on the validity ofa..?1 vidual cases.   With regard to board level legislation the TUC haveconcern at the &quot;protracted timetable&quot; implicit in the White Paper before
the right comes into effect, particularly Bince it is not proposed to providparity employee/shareholder representation.   The case for a single channelparity has also been stated in forthright terms by the Transport and GeneralUnion.OTHER INTERESTS8    Shorn of idiosyncracy and political rhetoric the message has been clear;is a fairly sold consensus against the Government1 s proposals for fall-backlegislation.   It is argued that this is incompatible with the White Paper&apos;spreference for voluntary agreement:   &quot;It is not realistic to talk of voluntaarrangements made against a background of compulsion&quot; (Sir Marcus Sieff).Paragraphs 9 to 13 elaborate these arguments.iTHE RIGHT TO DISCUSS9 Below board level the underlying metaphor is that participation is a tenlant whose development in individual companies will be threatened.   Some fi^including some of the most progressive) have produced evidence of their ownpractical endeavours to improve employee involvement to justify this proposiTheir fear is not only that existing structures may be upset, but also thatstatutory right will inevitably become a standard pattern.   That standard pais often seen as failing to distinguish clearly enough between consultationcollective-bargaining.10 It is argued that it takes time to extend the consultation process throall levels of a company, and that the scope of discussion may evolve withexperience.   Hence the need for flexible arrangements - possibly startingwork-place or divisional level rather than a single scheme centred on a conrwide JRC.   The alternative approach advocated by, for example, the CBI and tBritish Institute, of Management (Bin) is to suggest a code of practice in cowith which companies would be obliged to negotiate satisfactory participatioarrangements.   This line has been widely followed in other submissions, withor less emphasis on its legislative aspects.   The Industrial Society, a todyrepresenting both sides of industry, has indicated that while they would prea voluntary system, they are not averse to a right to consultation in firmsemploying as few as 250 people.   A number of other bodies, including the CBIhave registered objections to industrial democracy legislation taking effectthe threshold of 500 employees.11 Representations also deal with the exclusive role proposed by the White Pape.for trade unions in the JRC.   The JRC techniques would be more acceptable irpemployees were given statutory access to membership.   The principle that aemployees should have equal rights whether or not they are represented by aunion is almost universally advocated.   Some submissions have also aired epossible exacerbation of inter-union rivalry and the effects of excluding ,significant minority groups in a wide range of industries from the participjstructure,    (it is widely believed that, once the unions have statutory ri^ithey will not accept the presence of non-unionists in the JRCs discuss ion 4There is a strong lobby, led by the BUM, for official recognition of the *junior and middle management.

Several bodies and individuals, without prejudice to ^opposition to the Government&apos;s policy, acknowledged the logic of adop

The general feeling is that the companyB should be retained, if only (as the TUC staff has said) because to dolee would add very much to the oomplexity of the legislation.dentlalityhe TUC Memorandum does not touch on this point.   The CBI*s position iswhile much confidential information is already Bafely and satisfactorilyosed, final decisions on commercial secrecy must rest with management,rn has, however, been expressed particularly by the City and the financialr, including the Panel on Take-Overs and Mergers and the Unit Trustiation.   The Committee of London Clearing Bankers have suggested that therebe specific legislation making it an offence to misuse confidentialtion.BOARD LEVEL REPRESENTATIONhe TUC and T&amp;GWU apart, the Industrial Participation Association is theorgansiation to favour a legal right to appoint employee directors. Theds of the opposition can be briefly summarised.   Workers on the board woulde industry to political pressures from those who wish to re-shape societya pattern which the great majority of the electorate show no sign ofng to see&quot; (Engineering Employers&apos; Federation).   The legal provision thatnts directors from being mandated is said to have no credibility in thext of union based employee representatives.   The Institute of Directorspublicised attacks on the white Paper are reflected in a number ofBentations.   Their argument is that the presence of employees will weakenffectiveness of boards not only by disregarding the criterion of businessin appointing certain directors (the suggested 4 to 8 weeks1 training hasved little comment except that it is inadequate) but also by importing thelots of collective-bargaining into the boardroom.   Such opponents alsothat there is little enthusiasm on the shop-floor for board roomsentation.   Some have qualified their hostility by reference to thebility of voluntary developments subject to shareholder approval.   The CBIise the possibility in rare cases of employee directors by agreement butthat the boardroom is not normally the most appropriate forum foroipation.is argued that it is not appropriate to draw parallels with the positionope.  Trade union structures and the general industrial relations climateor example, Germany, Holland and Denmark are such that employee representation8 board takes place within a framework conducive to success, whereas therent climate in the UK makes statutory board level representation byyeeB potentially more likely to lead to damaging confrontation.8 CBI position is that, having stated a total opposition in principle6 statutory imposition of worker directors, a detailed oritique is superfluous,other commentators objection to single channel is almost universal. AsJRC, the organisations representing managers have argued that their^8 would require the protection of a constituency system of representation.Jboard g\ location of employee directors, whether on a unitary or two tier board,generated much interest.   The CBI dispute the White Paper&apos;s statementeepective of industrial democracy, two tier boards &quot;can offer certainover a unitary board&quot;.   They regard the two tier concept as irretrievably
tainted by itB association with employee directors, particularly since theproposed policy board is to have greater powers than the German supervisorymodel.   On the other side the BIM has long been an advocate of the two-tierstructure.   Otherwise there is some positive welcome for a two-tier option.The TTJC have asked for (and received) an assurance that the statute shoulddetermine the functions of the policy board on the basis set out in the whitePaper.Groups and Multinationals18   The CBI have offered no practical suggestions.   Their position is thatthe problems are of the Government own making, and demonstrate the case fortheir own preferred alternative.   A number of individual companies have madedetailed observations including some constructive comments, based on theirown situation and experience;(i)     9 prominent UK companies in US ownership have joined in collectiverepresentations that legislation on the lines of the White Paperwill deter inward investment.    (This point has of course heen mademore widely and is not - strictly speaking - a point about thetechnical problems in the application of statutory rights in groups)(ii)     some large UK companies with overseas operations have registeredobjections to legislation under which British employees mightachieve a special status in relation to overseas activities.ExemptionssL,r1pWg^!id^the !PeClal Ca8e 0f ^iaational companies, it is somewhatSTS^fn        there haye not been more direct demands for sectoral exemptions!Sat Ihl  rT? lnd?8tiy haB lode*d a direct claim.

Some commentators, including the BIM, would favouBan escape valve in the shape of a continuing discretionary power for some body^to authorise individual exemptions in appropriate cases.Institutions20 There has been considerable convergence in the comments on institutions.Even opponents of legislation accept that &quot;there is a case of sorts for a centMlocus for the development of participation&quot; (Association of British Chambers oMCommerce). The TUC want a new body, an IDC, on the grounds that it would be ableto see all the problems, &quot;whether arising on the voluntary or statutory approach,whether at board level or below board level , as a whole&quot;.

There are of course reservations about the establishment of anothelpublic body.CONCLUSION21 Limited agreement on the issue of institutions contrasts with the failure ih-
