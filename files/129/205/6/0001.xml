CONFIDENTIALImENT is THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCp(79) 6 COPY NO29 January 1979CABINETPAY POLICYMemorandum by the Prime Minister1.        It may help the Cabinet if I suggest now how we might structure ourdiscussion on Tuesday.talks WITH THE TRADES U*2TON CONGRESS (TUC)I.       We should take stock of the results of the discussions with theEconomic Committee (26 January), with the Employment Policy Committee(am 29 January) and with the General Council (pm 29 January).    The TUC havein mind a very full agenda for these meetings, but I expect discussion withthem, and later in Cabinet, will focus upon six points:a. The economic background.b. The ciirrent round.c The long term, covering the possibility of a three-year programmeto bring down the rate of inflation to 5 per cent.d. Industrial democracy.e. Prices.    We are already committed to a new Price CommissionBill.Trade union practice.-tthe end of this part of the discussion we can decide what follow-up action isneeded.&apos;HE ^MEDIATE SITUATIONJr*.      ^e need to consider both the ongoing industrial disputes (road haulage,ays, ambulancemen) and the next few crucial sets of negotiations.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALa. Road haulage.     &quot;Unblocking&quot; action to relieve particularpressure points is being considered separately.    We have agreed thatthe troops could not be used on a scale which would make anydifference to the overall supply situation.    A State of Emergency is nottherefore needed to allow requisition of vehicles.    Would it help in anyother way - would it have any psychological value in rallying the nation?b. Water. Our strategy so far has been to decouple this industryfrom the other public sector negotiations. What is the next step nowthat the present offer has been rejected?c. Local authorities.    Cabinet agreed last week to put pressure onboth sides to conclude the talks quickly.     The sticking-point at presentseems to be the terms of reference of the comparability study, whichthe employers have never liked.    Do we need to offer any promisesabout Rate Support Grant in the next round to cover the cost ofcomparability findings?    Do we have to consider any enhancements ofthe basic offer, especially o.e the water industry offer has beenrejected, or should we reverse last week&apos;s decision and be prepared toface prolonged industrial action?d. National Health Service (NHS).    Following last week&apos;s Cabinet,Ministers are trying to establish at what level the two sides think thereis a prospect of settlement.     The present offer is based on the localauthority one, worth (in the NHS case) between 8 and 9 per cent. Canwe get a deal below 10 per cent?    Before or after a local authoritysettlement?    How would it be affected by rejection of the water industryoffer?    What would be the effect on the nurses (on which the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations(EY(P) is to consider a paper on Wednesday)?e. Further ahead.    The next group of difficult public sector claims(apart from a particular and self-contained problem with the teacherswhich EY(P) should consider) will relate to the fuel industries - coal,ga.s and electricity.     Coal comes first and a low initial offer (3f percent) has just been made.    The coal industry&apos;s financial problem isserious and even this offer may be more than the industry can affordwithout increased subsidy.     The coal negotiations will therefore raisein acute form complex issues of prices, public expenditure and jobs.In the light of our discussion on particular cases the Cabinet will wantcord advice and guidance to the individual Ministers concerned and toE*(P).LJCdowning Street^ January 19792CONFIDENTIAL
