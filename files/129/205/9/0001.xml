CONFIDENTIALNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 98 February 1979COPY NO80CABINETBASIS FOR PREPARING THE 1979PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEYMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. We need to launch the 1979 Public Expenditure Survey byinstructing officials to draw up the Survey Report to Ministers. Thedraft instructions in the attached note follow the pattern of previous years.Their purpose is simply to commission the factual material required asbackground to the decisions on public expenditure in 1980-81 and subsequentyears which we shall take later in the year.2. The Suivey Report needs to provide a benchmark, or baseline,against which to measure possible changes in expenditure, and an analysisof possible changes which will give us a wide enough room for choice.The choice of baseline is straight-forward, as last year:  the noteprovides that the baseline should be the figures in Cmnd 7439 revalued to1979 Survey prices, subject to any agreed changes we make in the periodup to mid-May, when the work on the report needs to be brought to aconclusion.    The baseline figures for the new final year of the Survey(1983-84) repeat those for the preceding year (1982-83).    This leaves usfree to decide where any increases in that year should be allocated; ourdecisions about that year will in any event be highly provisional.3. Again as last year, the note provides that the report should set outproposals for additional expenditure, and that savings which could be madeto offset these additions should be identified.    The report should alsoidentify realistic options for reductions:   even when no reduction in ouroverall plans is needed, these enable Ministers to examine choices andpriorities within public expenditure as a whole and will have a bearing onthe review of priorities which the new Ministerial Committee on PublicExpenditure Priorities established by the Prime Ministers minute of5 February is to undertake.    In last year&apos;s Survey these options were setat Zi per cent of the expenditure in each Survey year, but on this occasionit is proposed to revert to the level used in the 1977 Survey, ie at least^2 per cent in 1980-81 and at least 5 per cent in the subsequent years.This will offer us more scope to consider possible changes in prioritiesthe medium term.    The lower level of options in 1980-81 than in lateryears reflects the difficulty in many programmes of making changes whichwill have their full-year effect immediately.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4t        The Secretary of State for Scotland has agreed that the instructionsshould incorporate the arrangement which was introduced last year forthe handling of additional bids and options for reductions in Scottishprogrammes.    Pending decisions on devolution, the attached note alsoindicates that figures for devolved services are to be prepared on thesame basis as last year, but that a new presentation will be introducedif decisions are taken in time.5.        I ask my colleagues to agree that the Public Expenditure SurveyCommittee should prepare the 1979 Report on the basis set out in the Annexto this paper.J BTreasury Chambers8 February 19792CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEXBASIS FOR PREPARATION OF 1979 SURVEY REPORTIntroduction1. The purpose of the 1979 survey is to enable Ministersto decide the level of public expenditure programmes as abasis for control in 1980-81; and to review the programmesfor later years, and extend them into 1983-84, for provisionalplanning purposes.    The survey report prepared by officialsis intended to provide the material on which such decisionscan be taken.    The analysis of additional proposals andoptions for reductions does not imply that Ministers willnecessarily adopt any or all of them, but is intended to enablthem to discuss a wider range of choices and priorities withinpublic expenditure as a whole.The starting point2. The 1979 survey takes as its starting point the levelsof expenditure programmes published in &quot;The Government&apos;sExpenditure Plans: 1979-80 to 1982-83&quot; (Cmnd 7^39).3. For the years 1979-80, 1980-81, 1981-82 and 1982-83,the figures to be included in the survey baseline tables arethose published in Cmnd 74-39, adjusted for:i.   revaluation to 1979 survey prices;ii.   any changes approved by Ministers up to 18 May1979, and any offsetting savings agreed in con-nection with such changes;any agreed reductions in the volume of expenditurefor 1979-80 and later years resulting from theexamination of 1979-80 Estimates;lv*     any approved classification changes.For 1983-84-, the baseline figures should1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALbe equal to those for 1982-83, except where it is agreedbetween the Treasury and. the department concerned that somelesser figure is appropriate.   Any requirements going beyondthe 1982-83 level should be identified for Cabinet decision.The survey report3.     The survey report should provide the following infoimation:-a. the Cmrrd 74-39 figures, after revaluation andclassification changes (including the classi-fication changes which may result from theGovernment&apos;s proposals on devolution - seeparagraph 10 below);b. agreed changes since Cmnd 74-39 within thecategories in paragraph 3ii and iii;c. the resulting baseline figures for the newsurvey;d. proposed additions and reduced requirements(see paragraph 7 below);e. options for reductions (see paragraph 8 below).The items at d. and e. apply only to 1980-81 and the threesubsequent years.    Proposals for additional expenditure in1979-80 should not normally be made in the context of thesurvey: any such proposals will be dealt with as they arisethrough the year as part of the operational control of thecontingency reserve.6.     The chapter on each programme should set out the maincomponents of the baseline figures and describe the impli-cations of keeping expenditure on the services concernedwithin these figures.    Each of the items under 5d* anc* e*should also be briefly described and tabulated.   The desc-ription should include an indication of the spending authorityconcerned (ie central government department, local authorities
CONFIDENTIALpublic corporation).   Any consequences for civil servicelocal authority manpower should be stated.In the case of items under 5d, the report should describehe nature of all proposed changes other than those coveredn paragraph 3 above.   Wherever possible it should distinguishhanges which arise from changed economic or demographic &apos;ssumptions and should indicate items which departments andhe Treasury have agreed are for the maintenance of standardsrovided in existing plans.   It should also indicate whetherhe level of the expenditure concerned is governed by existingegislation or regulations or is within the Governmenfsduinistrative control.   Any savings that could be made toffset proposed additions to expenditure should be identified.As regards the options under 5e, the report should illu-trate the most feasible reductions in programmes in 1980-81d later years, amounting to at least 2-  per cent in 1980-81nd 5 per cent in later years.   These options may include theffsetting savings mentioned in paragraph 7 provided that theatter savings could be made on their own, without the accom-anying&apos;increases in expenditure.   Programme texts shouldndicate whether main or subordinate legislation would besquired and whether legislation in which the change could bencluded is already planned.   The responsible department andpending authority should be stated, and the specific areastare the reductions would fall should be identified.   As notedtave, the inclusion of options in the report in no way impliesMinisters will adopt them, but it enables them to examinetaices and-priorities within the overall total.&apos;  The nationalised industries will be the subject of aeParate interdepartmental report to Ministers on the invest-Programmes and financing for each industry, includingfPropriate options in respect of individual industries. Theaticmg figures for the nationalised industries as a wholeke summarised in the survey report.    If the proposals
CONFIDENTIALfor total net borrowing are higher than the figures in Cmnd74-39, the reasons for this will be summarised and options willbe set out with the objective of keeping overall nationalisedindustry borrowing requirements within the Cmnd 7439 totals.Any changes in the net government lending figures which resultfrom changes in the assumptions on the pattern of net foreigncurrency borrowing will be explained.10. For this year&apos;s survey it is proposed that, as in thefinal stages last year, the expenditure on Scottish Office pro-grammes should in general be treated as a block and adjusted(upwards or downwards) in proportion to the total of adjustmentsmade to equivalent English programmes.    The possibility ofextending this arrangement to Wales is under consideration.The conventional proportions to be used for this purpose wouldbe: 85, England; 10, Scotland; 5, Wales.   It is not proposedtherefore that the Scottish Office (or Welsh Office, if thearrangement is extended to Wales) should submit additionalbids or options for reductions in individual programmes forwhich there is an English equivalent.11. Pending decisions on devolution, figures for expenditureon devolved services will be prepared on the existing basis,so that, if necessary, special analyses can be included as inlast year&apos;s report.   If, following the referendums on 1 March,Parliament decides in favour of devolution in either Scotlandor Wales or both, expenditure on devolved services will in futurbe presented in separately identified public expenditure pro-grammes and classification changes in existing programmes willbe made accordingly.   If the decisions, and a firm timetable,are available in time, then this new presentation will be adoptelfor the next White Paper (it may even be possible to introduceit in the 1979 survey report).4CONFIDENTIAL
