CONFIDENTIALgMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT80CP(79) 2013 March 1979COPY NOCABINETNURSES&apos; PAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Prices andConsumer ProtectionSUMMARY1.       Thia memorandum puts forward a recommendation from theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on PayNegotiations (EY(P)) on the form of an improved pay offer to the nurses.BACKGROUNDI.       Following the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 1 March (CM(79) 10th Conclusions,Minute 2) the Secretary of State for Social Services made an offer to theManagement and Staff Sides of the Nurses and Midwives Whitley Council.This offer was on a par with the deal offered to those involved in the publicservices disputes.    It involved a basic increase of 9 per cent from 1 April1979; a comparability study, the results of which would be implemented intwo equal stages on 1 August 1979 and 1 April 1980;  and an advance payment0*  1 per week from 1 April 1979 for those working 35 hours a week or moreto be deducted from the first stage of the comparability award.3&apos;       The Whitley Council representatives, on both Sides, reacted^favourably to the package offered.    The particular sticking point was whatwas on offer for 1 April 1979.    In informal discussions, it was establishedthata settlement could probably be reached if the amount of the advancePayment were increased from  1 a week to  2. 50 a week.    This would notEvolve any ultimate increase in the cost to the Exchequer provided that tne&quot;-omparability payments from 1 August were sufficient to provide for clawback.To avoid both extra expenditure and the necessity for reductions in theVaries of the lowest grades after 1 August, the comparability study mustProduce an overall increase of rather more than 17 per cent.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEy(p) CONSIDERATION4,       At our meeting on 8 March EY(P) considered whether the Secretary ofState for Social Services should be authorised to make this concession. Wetook into account -a. That the nurses&apos; original claim for special treatment goes backto March 1978 and was subsequently developed in relation tc thespecial treatment accorded to doctors and dentists and other groups inthe last round (see Background Note at Annex 1).b. The extra burdens carried by nurses during recent industrialaction over the last year and especially in the National Health Service(NHS) ancillaries dispute still continuing, which has contributed to thewidespread support in the media and in Parliament which their claimfor special consideration is receiving.c. The harm both to the Government and to the NHS which couldflow from continuing conflict with the nurses.     The willingness of thenurses to continue to accept extra burdens will be of critical impor-tance if we are unable to secure resumption of normal work by NHSancillarier (see paragraph 5 below).    Without an early settlement withthe nurses this co-operation will be at risk and thw National Union ofPublic Employees (NUPE) and the Confederation of Health ServiceEmployees nurses are likely to take industrial action with particularlyserious effects in long-stay hospitals.*      We. accepted that to improve the offer to the nurses carried implicationsbrother groups.    In the NHS ancillaries dispute, NUPE has voted stionglyagainst acceptance of the offer.    The other three unions are in favour, buttoe majority of anciallaries are NUPE members.    It is still uncertainwhether an agreement will be reached.    Even after the formal ending of thedispute industrial action by NUPE members may go on.    In the case ofambulancemen the position in similarly uncertain and industrial action islikely to continue.    There are obvious risks that an improved offer to thenurses will prejudice the chance of settlements, on the basis of the present0fters, for both these groups.    Local government manuals have alreadyaccepted their offer, but, especially if the concession to nurses were conceded^so to the NHS ancillaries and ambulancemen, there must be risk of unionPressure to reopen that settlement.    The Civil Service unions are watching^e nurses&apos; position and will expect treatment which they regard as no less^ourable.    The teachers&apos; unions may react in the same way.    Some figures^nthe sums involved in increasing the  1 on account to  2 or  2. 50 forrses       for other groups are at Annex 3.^he Sub-Committee took the view that the balance of argument favouredthe m^ an ^ncrease(i &quot;on account&quot; payment to the nurses but that the timing oflrnproved offer required further consideration, with particular regard toCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe negotiations on NHS anciliaries and ambulancemen.    They recommendedthat the concession should take the form of an increase of the  1 per weekpayment on account to  2, with discretion for the Secretary of State for SocialServices to go up to  2. 50 if necessary, to get a settlement *or higher grades.The on account payment should be graduated between  2 and  2. 50 to ensurethat on a reasonable expectation of the outcome of the comparability study nograde would have a reduction in pay on 1 August (see Annex 2).    The Secretaryof State for Social Services has subsequently identified three possible ways ofavoiding any risk of pay reduction -a. to pay  2 to everyone; orb. to pay  2 a week in advance to those on lower scales and  2. 50to the rest; orc. to pay  2. 50 to everyone with some slight extension of therecovery period after the end of March 1980 to the extent necessary toavoid any pay reductions from 1 August 1979.CONCLUSIONS7.       The Cabinet are invited to decide -i. Whether, despite the possible repercussions, the increasedpayment in advance should be made to the nurses.ii. If so, whether this should take the form of an increase to  2 toall nurses of the payment on account.iii. Whether, in order to reach a settlement, the Secretary of Statefor Social Services should be authorised to go up to  2. 50.iv. If so, should he be left with discretion on the choice of options asat paragraph b. or c. above.v. Whether the improved offer should be held back until it is clearthat the NHS anciliaries and ambulancemen will settle on the basis ofthe existing offers, which limit payment on account to  1 a week.R HApartment of Prices and Consumer Protection12 March 19793CONFIDENTIAL
Annex 10JJSB HOTESarses and Hidwives received a 10 per oent pay increase on 1 April 1978ir Phas* 111*Is submitting their 1978 claim, the Staff Side argued that nurses should betitled to additional payments above the 10 per cent because they were not abletake advantage of the incomes policy provision for self-financing productivityi, This argument was not accepted, and in October 1978 the two Sides of thetley Council made a joint submission asking for nurses to be treated as a specialt ander paragraph 16 of the White Paper, &quot;Winning the Battle Against&apos;Inflation&quot;.ij claimed that the arguments which had justified special case treatment fortors and dentists, firemen and policemen applied equally to nurses.   They haveo argued that, since their initial claim for additional payments formed part ofir 1978 claim, some additional payments should be made in the 1978/79 pay round,tthis has bsen repeatedly rejected by the Government.   The Management Side also-isted the claim to any payments beyond incomes policy limits in 1978/791 buted for additional payments from April 1979f ia line with&apos; the doctors and dentistsother groups.The Government decided that nurses * pay should be dealt with in the contextthe comparability investigation proposals.   Following further exchanges, a settle-t has now b*en proposed for nurses in the following terms i-1. An increase of 9 per cent in the nurses1 paybill from 1 April 1979*2, An ^rgant comparability study to be undertaken.l* Implementation of the results of the comparability study in two equal8tagsgf on 1 August 1979 end 1 April 1980.4* A Government commitment to accept the results of a comparability studyprovided the Management and Staff Sides for their part, will give asimilar commitment.5- An advance payment, on account, of  1.00 per week from 1 April 1979 formrsea working 35 hours a week or more, to be deducted. from the firststags of the comparability implementation on 1 August 1979*
Annex 2fiT OP A CONCESSION OH USANCE PAXMENTS TO NOISESThe proposal for advance payments *on account&apos; to nurses is that, in eachnefc bettrees. 1 April and the end of July 1979* supplements should be added to theof all nurses who work 35 hours a week or more.   The total amount of theseJvance payments will be deducted from the first stage payments of the compara-tility study.  First stage payments will be made from the beginning of August 1979D the end ef March 1980.   There are 17 weeks from April to end - July 1979 andiieeks from August 1979 to end - Haroh, 1980.   Thus, for each  1 paid in advancewen April and July, a sum of slightly less than 5Qp per week will need to betooted in the period August to March.   The agreement will need to provide for anylalance of advance payments to be deducted from terminal payments due to any staffib leave after the advance payment arrangements are implemented.Costings have been done to test the implications of a concession to nursesif advance payments from April in excess of  1 a week.   The main point at issue hasa to test whether there could be any risk that a concession might result in anyarses receiving less pay per week from August 1979 than they had received (includingpants on account) between April and July.   For this purpose, costings have beentat in relation to basic pay scales, since there is no consistent pattern ofMrihrtioa of the enhancements which affect total earnings.li The coggings show that, for an advance payment of  2.30 per week, there would&apos;!Mri.sk of any reduction in weekly payments of basic pay after August, even fortie lowest V:.;,5.i.c scales, if the final comparability study result produced an increase&quot;7 per ceat or more.   If the comparability study produced a total increase figure115 per oent, then advance payments of  2.50 per week would result in reductions; from % to 35p per week for student and pupil nurses and those on the firstI joints of the (unqualified) nursing auxiliaries scale.   If the advance paymentit these grades were  2 a week, the full comparability result would need to be** 1; per esnt before there was any risk of reductions from August onwards.ft? illustrative purposes, the basic grade of Staff Nurse (ie, a nursetag the SES qualification) is normally used.   On the basic Staff Nurse scale,^effect oa pay, following a 9$ award, of a  2.50 advance from April to July,II a total eaoparability increase of either 15 per cent or 20 per .-ent (with half-^frcce August) would be as follows 1-T5iApril to endJuly 1979August 1979 toKaron 198020%April to endJuly 1979August 1979 to&quot;arch 1980Minimum of Scale * 2.50* 3.15* 2.50* 4.60* 3 years * 2.50* 3.72* 2.50* 5.37Maximum of Scale* 2.50* 4.10* 2.50* 5.86
