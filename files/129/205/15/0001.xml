CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 15 COPY NO21 February 1979CABINETRHODESIAN SANCTIONS:  FURTHER INQUIRYMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor1. The Ministerial Group on a Further Inquiry into Rhodesian Oil Sanctionshave considered the situation in the light of the House of Lords&apos; rejection ofthe Governmenfs proposal for a Special Commission drawn from both Houses.This proposal - and in particular the provisos about sitting in private andsifting Cabinet papers through a Lord of Appeal - was designed to facilitatethe production of Cabinet papers without setting a precedent for ordinarySelect Committees:  and the Government made it clear that acceptance ofthe procedure was a condition of going ahead.2. The proposal was passed by the House of Commons on 1 February ona free vote by 146 votes (127 Labour, 7 Liberal, 11 Conservative and 1 UlsterUnionist) to 67 votes (66 Conservative, 1 Liberal).    It was however defeatedin the Lords, also on a free vote, by 102 votes to 58, on 8 February. TheGovernment now have to consider their position in the light of the Lords1vote which renders the Resolution passed by the Commons (&quot;That it isdesirable that a Joint Committee of both Houses to be known as &apos;the SpecialCommission on Oil Sanctions&apos; to be appointed ....&apos;*) inapplicable.3-       Against this background the options open to the Government seemto be -a. To try again to put through the original proposalHowever the same Resolution cannot be put twice into the House ofCommons in the same Session of Parliament.    Furthermore in viewof the size of the vote against and the tone of the vote in the Lords,no minor changes to the existing Resolution would make it any moreacceptable to the Lords.    It is however relevant that Lord Hailsham,while strongly opposing the inquiry, made it clear that the Lords werespeaking only for themselves and that it was open to the Commons togo ahead with an Inquiry of their own.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. A Commons only InquiryA Lord of Appeal could not be used as Chairman and there might bedifficulty in finding a suitable backbencher to conduct the sift ofCabinet papers and act as an impartial Chairman.    In any case, aCommons inquiry, whatever it was called, would be virtuallyimpossible to differentiate from a normal Select Committee of theHouse and would not therefore meet the Cabinet&apos;s requirement of notsetting a precedent for the disclosure of Cabinet and departmentalpapers to Select Committees.    There must also be some risk that,given the line taken by Mr St John-Stevas and Sir Michael Havers indebate together with the Lords&apos; rejection, a new proposal would faileven in the House of Commons;  or that the Opposition would refuseto co-operate in the Inquiry.c. Look again at -i. Tribunal of Inquiry under the 1921 ActThe Cabinet earlier rejected this because a Tribunal would belengthy and legalistic in procedure, and unsuited to the highlypolitical character envisaged for the Inquiry into theadministration of oil sanctions.    In any case it would requirea Resolution by both Houses and the Lords would presumablyreject it.ii. Committee of Privy CounsellorsThe Government could appoint a small group of PrivyCounsellors, give them the same terms of reference as thoseproposed for the Special Commission and ask them to reportquickly.    Such a Committee, which might be made a RoyalCommission, could possibly also be subject to similarprovisions in respect of the disclosure of papers as thoseenvisaged for the Special Commission.    This proposal wasseriously considered by the Cabinet earlier but opinion in theParliamentary Labour Party appears to be strongly against it.It must also be borne in mind that the Government would have tosecure the co-operation of the Opposition in providing members andof Mr Heath and Sir Harold Wilson in making available their Cabinetpapers if any further Inquiry is to have authority and credibility.The more any revised proposals deviate from those put to Parliament,the less likely is such co-operation likely to be forthcoming.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALd. Do nothingThe Government could say that its proposals for a Special Commissionhave proved unacceptable to Parliament as a whole;  that the proposalswere a very carefully considered package designed to meet anunprecedented requirement in a way which would not set a precedent;and that any of the possible alternative forms of Inquiry would notprovide a basis on which the Government would feel able to make anexception to the long-established conventions of the confidentiality ofCabinet and Government papers.    The grounds for having an Inquiryremain valid, but public demand for it now seems to be much less.4. The Ministerial Group rejected options 3.a, and 3.c. above. Themajority of the Group felt that an attempt should be made to see if aCommons-only Special Commission could be secured with precisely the samesafeguards envisaged for the Special Commission drawn from both Houses.This would involve finding a suitable Privy Counsellor, not associatedMinisterially with the events, to act in the role earlier envisaged forLord Scarman.    It would also necessitate the co-operation of the Oppositionin providing members and of Mr Heath in producing the Cabinet papers ofthe Conservative Administration.5. If the Cabinet agree that this further attempt should be made beforeaccepting the option at 3.d. , the Ministerial Group envisage that the nextsteps would be:-i. Informal soundings of the Opposition and of Mr Heath to seewhether they would co-operate provided a new Motion was carriedin the House of Commons naming the chairman and on a free vote(other than for Ministers).ii. The matter would be discussed at a meeting of the ParliamentaryLabour Party before a final decision was taken in order to ensure thatsufficient Labour support would be forthcoming to carry a Motioncontaining the essential safeguards for Government documents.E-JLord Chancellors Office21 February 19793CONFIDENTIAL
