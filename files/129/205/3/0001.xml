CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT 15 THE PROPERTY OF HEP BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 322 January 1979COPY NO gOCABINETSTATEMENT ON THE DEFENCE ESTIMATES 1979Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence1. I attach the draft of this year&apos;s Statement on the Defence Estimateswhich I would propose, subject to the agreement of the Cabinet, to publishin the week beginning 19th February.2. The draft aims to give a straightforward, and relatively low-keyexposition of the Government&apos;s defence policy but I have emphasised inChapter 1 the 30th Anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO), which falls this year, and I have, as in last yeai&apos;s Statement,stressed both the benefits we receive from the Alliancs and the substantialcontribution we make to it.    The flexibility of the Armed Forces to renderassistance in addition to our  commitment to the Alliance, for example, ,in our new undertaking to assist in United Nations peacekeeping operations,is also highlighted.3. I should also draw the Cabinet&apos;s particular attention to the openingparagraphs of Chapter 4, concerned with recruiting and outflow.    I amseriously concerned about the difficulties in this respect that the Servicesare currently facing and I have judged it right to give a forthright, butnon-alarmist, explanation of the present position.4. The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee have approved the draftssubject to some minor amendments which are incorporated in the text andto my further consideration of the introductory paragraphs of Chapter 4,to which I have referred above,    I should be glad to have the Cabinet&apos;sapproval to publish the Statement.F MMinistry of Defence22 January 1979CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL1DEFENCE POLICYTHIRTY YEARS OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC ALLIANCE -101. 1979 sees the 30th anniversary of the formation of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).    On 4 April 194912 nations - Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy,Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UnitedKingdom and the United States - signed the North Atlantic Treatyto preserve peace and international security and to promotestability in the North Atlantic area.    They have since beenjoined by Greece, Turkey and the Federal Republic of Germany.Under the Treaty each member undertakes that an armed attackwithin the Treaty area against one or more of the members ofthe Alliance will be considered as an attack against them all. .The Alliance maintains a peacetime integrated military structurewith armed forces under international command, thus ensuring aclose-knit deterrent and defensive capability.102. The Alliance has been remarkable throughout its existenceboth for its close and cohesive character and for its successin providing security for all its members.   Whether, in itsabsence, there would have been war or hostile encroachment cannever be proved; what is certain is that the risks would havebeen far higher.   The Alliance has survived shocks, both internal1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand external, and it remains resilient and effective.    The pastyear&apos;s activity well illustrates this, particularly with theendorsement at the 1978 Washington Summit meeting of the Long-Term Defence Programme (LTDP) initiated in London the yearbefore.    The LTDP stresses a firm but moderate response to themilitary build-up of the Warsaw Pact, and a determination touse Alliance defence resources to maximum effect by greaterco-operation and long-term co-ordinated planning.103. The Alliance&apos;s balanced military capability remains thefoundation of the contribution it makes to the security of allits members.    The strategic nuclear forces, provided essentiallyby the United States, give protection and ultimate deterrence-The theatre nuclear forces, in which several Alliance membersparticipate in various ways, are a   crucial    link between thestrategic forces and the conventional elements.   At the conven-tional level, forces are provided and deployed to ensure theforward defence of the whole NATO area; and the engagement ofmembers in forward defence is underlined and ensured by thearrangements whereby countries station forces forward in theterritory of others, and the further arrangements for extensiveand joint reinforcement in time of need.    The entire patternof Alliance defence embodies the   firm   commitment of the UnitedStates to the security of the whole Alliance, which PresidentCarter stressed in the most definite terms at the Washington Summit104. The Alliance has for a number of years placed increasedemphasis upon complementing the improvement of its defensive2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcapability with efforts to establish a more stable inter-national relationship through arms control and disarmamentagreements.   The Ottawa declaration of 1974, marking theAlliance&apos;s 25th Anniversary, reaffirmed the twin aims ofdefence and detente.    In pursuing them the Alliance&apos;s practiceof frank and timely consultations has grown.    On the initiativeof the United Kingdom, Alliance machinery for consultation onarms control and disarmament issues will in future be used morefully.105. Alliance efforts to reduce tension betweenEast and West and to discourage any attempts to use militarypower for political ends can only be successfully pursued onthe basis of an adequate defensive military posture. Theendorsement of the LTDP at the V/ashington Summit was set firmlyin the context of complementary approaches seeking on the onehand to promote detente, including progress in negotiations onarms control and disarmament and, on the other, to strengthenthe Alliance&apos;s defensive ability to deter the use, or threatof use, of military power by the V/arsaw Pact.106. The United Kingdom can be grateful for the securitybenefits it has derived from the Alliance since 1949.    It canequally be proud of the part it continues to play in the Alliance.It devotes to Alliance purposes the overwhelming proportionof its defence effort; and, as is explained later in thisStatement, it has made a prompt and constructive response tothe LTDP.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDETENTE AND DISARMAMENT107. In a year marked by the United Nations Special Sessionon Disarmament, to which the United Kingdom made a distinctivecontribution, the Government has continued to strive foragreement on practical and verifiable, measures of arms controland disarmament.    During the Special Session the United Kingdomgave an undertaking to non-nuclear weapon states which are partyto the Non-Proliferation Treaty, or to other internationallybinding commitments not to manufacture or acquire nuclearexplosive devices; HMG undertook &quot;not to use nuclear weaponsagainst such states except in the case of an attack on theUnited Kingdom, its dependent territories, its armed forces orits Allies by such a state in association or alliance with anuclear weapon state.&quot;108. The year has also seen an expansion of Britain&apos;s relationswith China in many fields, and this has included a widening ofcontact in the field of defence.   As an important element ofits pursuit of international stability, the Government willcontinue to foster good relations with China.   We do not wish,however, to develop friendly relations with one state at theexpense of our relations with any other; our relations with theSoviet Union remain central to the development of detente.Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT)109. The achievement of a further Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union will be of. 4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALparamount importance in the pursuit of detente. The British Govern-ment fully supports the efforts being made to bring the SALT IInegotiations to a successful conclusion.   The Agreement as itseems to be emerging will enhance stability by setting firmand wide-ranging constraints, both quantitative and qualitative,on the strategic nuclear armouries of the two super-powers.110.   The United States Government has throughout kept theBritish Government informed on the progress of the negotiations.The SALT II Agreement is expected to be in three parts:a. a Treaty lasting until 31 December 1985,which will inter alia set out the overall ceilingsfor the numbers of strategic nuclear deliverysystems which both sides may possess, and sub-ceilingson particular elements on each side&apos;s strategicforces;b. a shorter-term Protocol dealing on a temporarybasis with certain issues (including ground andsea-launched cruise missiles) not covered in theTreaty;c. A Statement of Principles dealing with theapproach to future SALT negotiations.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Government look forward to     the satisfactory conclusion ofthe negotiations and early ratification of the   Agreement byboth sides.Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR)111. Together with its Allies at the Vienna talks the Governmentis working for an agreement with the Warsaw Pact participantson mutual and balanced force reductions in central Europe whichwould achieve the agreed objective of contributing to a morestable relationship and to the strengthening of peace and securitin Europe.112. The Allied position is based on the principle that theoutcome should be one of approximate parity between the twosides in the area of reductions, in the form of a commoncollective ceiling on ground and air manpower.    This wouldrequire bigger reductions by the Warsaw Pact, since it has agreater number of men in the area.   The Alliance has made anumber of moves, most recently in December 1978, to meet particu-lar Eastern concerns.    In June 1978 the Warsaw Pact participantsmade their most significant move since the negotiations beganand agreed to a number of principles essential to the Allianceposition.   But the means envisaged by the Warsaw Pact forimplementing these principles are unsatisfactory.    In particular,they accepted that reductions should result in common collectivemanpower ceilings, but continue to maintain that approximate6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALparity already exists.    The need for agreement on manpowerfigures is now recognised by both sides as a central factorin reaching an MBFR agreement, and the Alliance is focussingconsiderable negotiating effort on attempts to find the sourceof the discrepancy between the figures tabled by the WarsawPact and its own estimates of Warsaw Pact forces.113. The Government continues to attach great importance toa successful outcome to the MBFR talks.    The negotiations haveproceeded slowly but steadily and are an important part of theEast/West dialogue.    The NATO Summit in Washington in May 1978offered to raise the negotiations to Foreign Minister levelonce substantial progress had been made and it was clear thatsuch a meeting could contribute effectively to the earlyconclusion of a mutually satisfactory agreement.Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)114. The CSCE follow-up meeting in Belgrade, which ended inMarch 1978, failed to agree on any development of the militaryconfidence-building measures (CBMs) agreed in Helsinki in 1975,but its Concluding Document reaffirmed the resolve of all7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCSCE countries to continue to implement all the provisions ofthe Final Act.115. In 1978, NATO countries notified six military manoeuvresto all other CSCE participants.   Four of these involved over25,000 troops; the other two were smaller and thus theirnotification was discretionary under the CSCE arrangements.CSCE observers were invited to four NATO manoeuvres, butobservers from Warsaw Pact countries attended only two. TheSoviet Union notified three major manoeuvres (but none ona smaller-scale) and invited observers only to a singlemanoeuvre,  &apos;Berezina&apos;, which took place in February as theBelgrade Conference was drawing to a close.116. During the year, there was an exchange of visits betweenthe military personnel of the United Kingdom and those of theWarsaw Pact, between staff and cadets of the Royal MilitaryAcademy, Sandhurst and those of the Nicolai Balescu InfantrySchool, Romania.Comprehensive Test Ban117. Steady progress has been made in the negotiations betweenthe United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union tosecure a properly verifiable multilateral treaty banningnuclear explosions in all environments, which would attract8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhe adherence of as many states as possible. It is hoped thatgreement can now be reached very soon.Other Arms Control and Disarmament Measures118.   The Government continues to participate actively inother arms control discussions in the United Nations, theCommittee on Disarmament (formerly the Conference of theCommittee on Disarmament) and elsewhere.    One element of thesediscussions is the preparatory work for the 1979 UN conferenceon the prohibition, or restriction on the use, of particularconventional weapons which may cause unnecessary suffering orhave indiscriminate effects.    The Government maintains itsefforts in support of the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferationof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and other measures aimed at reducingthe risk of the spread of nuclear weapons.    The NegativeSecurity Assurance (see paragraph 107) was framed with thisparticularly in mind.    In its capacity as a depositary powerfor the NPT and the Biological Weapons Convention, Britainlaunched resolutions at the 1978 UN General Assembly settingpreparations in hand for the two important review conferenceswhich are to take place in 1980.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDEFENCE AND DETERRENCE119.   Until the Government1s objective of general and completedisarmament under strict and effective international controlhas been met, however, a substantial defence effort remainsnecessary; and, indeed, is a precondition of successfulpolitical action.    The balanced modernisation and improvementwhich the Alliance is making to its forces are designed tomaintain the credibility of the deterrent strategy of flexibleresponse.   This calls for the ability to meet aggression inany form and at any level in a way appropriate to the levelof force used, and to demonstrate to any aggressor that therisks from aggression far outweigh any prospect of gainingan advantage.   NATO does not need to match the Warsaw Pact inevery category of armament to achieve the flexibility necessaryfor this ability to deter, but it does need a wide range offorces embracing conventional units, a theatre nuclear capa-bility and strategic nuclear forces.   These must be bothcredible in themselves and sufficiently closely linked togetherto convince an aggressor that he could overcome one level ofcapability only at the expense of incurring a response fromthe next in a process which would continue, if necessary, upto the strategic level.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALWARSAW PACT CAPABILITY120. Military capabilities cannot be measured simply infigures, nor can a ratio of the balance between NATO and theWarsaw Pact give a complete picture.   Many other factors haveto be considered, including quality, readiness, support,training,morale, deployment and tactics.   Nevertheless, as seenby Western eyes, the growth in quantity of the Soviet forces(see illustrative Figures 1 and 2 *), together with continuedqualitative improvements, has extended their capability wellbeyond what can be considered necessary for purely defensivepurposes.   Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the current balance offorces between the two Alliances in the vital areas of the easternAtlantic and central Europe.121. To sustain this level of armed forces is a considerabledrain on Soviet resources, but there is no sign that the SovietGovernment intends to reduce its military expenditure; on thecontrary, the Soviet Union has asked the Warsaw Pact countriesto increase their defence expenditure. The United Kingdomand the United States estimate that Soviet defence spendingcontinues to account for about 11-13% of the Soviet Union1sgross national product.    It is estimated to have risen by anaverage rate of about k% per year in real terms between 1973 and1977 and still to be rising, although rather more slowly.   A highproportion, now well over a third, is devoted to the procurementof new weapons, and over a fifth of the total is spent on research11* Figures 1-4 attached at end of draft.JCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand development (R &amp; D) of high tecnnc,l0gy weapon systems.122.   Expenditure on Soviet naval forces has increased steadilyover the last five years and several new classes of submarinehave been introduced: the Delta II and III classes of nuclear-powered ballistic-missile-firing submarines, (the latter havingmultiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV));the Charlie II class nuclear-powered cruise-missile-firingsubmarines; and the Alpha class nuclear-powered attacksubmarines.    Other improvements are the continuing Kiev classaircraft carrier programme, development of afloat support andamphibious capacity and the introduction of Backfire bombersfor the naval air force.    Spending on ground forces has alsoshown a steady increase; improvements have been widespread,especially in new tanks such as the T-64 and T-72, in self-propelled artillery and in infantry combat vehicles. Missilesof new and advanced design continue to be introduced inquantity.   Expenditure on the air forces has increased withmajor re-equipment programmes, particularly affecting thetactical air force, which has acquired new advanced swing-wingaircraft such as Fencer and Flogger.    The number of heavilyarmed and armoured attack helicopters is increasing, addingsignificantly to the Warsaw Pact&apos;s anti-tank capability. Newimproved armaments, including stand-off weapons, are beingintroduced, and so are better avionics for reconnaissance,target acquisition and weapon aiming.12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL123. The capability of the East German, Polish andCzechoslovak armed forces to support the Soviet Union is beingprogressively enhanced, by increases in holdings of combatequipment in their armies similar to that already used in Sovietformations and by the introduction of more modern equipment,mainly of Soviet origin, to both air and ground forces.124. The Soviet Union is also introducing new medium-rangenuclear systems capable of striking western Europe.    The SS-20multiple-warhead, mobile ballistic missile gives the Soviettheatre forces a less vulnerable, more accurate and thereforemore flexible capability than hitherto; the Backfire bombergives similar advantages.NATO DEFENCE EFFORT125. Alliance Heads of State and Government approved at theMay 1978 Council meeting a fresh study of long-term trends inBast-West relations during the 1980s.    The study concluded thatin general the foreign and other policies of the Soviet Union,including its concept of detente, were not likely to undergoany fundamental change.    The Soviet Union and its allies wouldremain interested in improving their contacts with the West incertain spheres, such as economic relations, but the SovietUnion could also be expected to continue to attach high priorityto the steady enhancement of its military strength across theentire range of capabilities, and to remain ready to devote13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmassive resources to this.   Against this background, the study-confirmed the continuing validity of the Alliance^ two comple-mentary goals of the pursuit of detente and the maintenance ofmilitary security.Long-Term Defence Programme126.   Heads of State and Government also endorsed at theWashington Summit the LTDP, developed, as part of NATO&apos;s widerplanning, in order to strengthen the defence and deterrentposture of the Alliance in the face of the continuing build-upin Warsaw Pact military strength.    It comprises a wide range ofmeasures designed to help adapt NATO&apos;s defence posture to thechallenges of the 1980s.   Examples of particular relevance tothe United Kingdom are as follows:a. Readiness:    increases in holdings of anti-armourweapons, improvement of protection against nuclear,biological and chemical warfare, acceleration oflogistic support.b. Reinforcement:   measures to accelerate themovement of significant reinforcements from NorthAmerica and the United Kingdom to the forward areasin the crucial early phase of a crisis. .     Reserve Mobilisation:   measures to ensure thatreservists and reserve formations are properlyequipped, trained and capable of being deployedrapidly.14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALd.     Maritime Posture:   measures providing forgreatly increased capabilities in maritime command,control and communications and also in other areassuch as the air defence of naval units, anti-submarine warfare and mine countermeasures.je.     Air Defence:   the acquisition of improvedsurface-to-air weapons to give the Alliance bettercapability for engaging V/arsaw Pact aircraftpenetrating at all levels.f.     Communications, command and control:   measures whichinclude the implementation of the second phase ofthe NATO integrated communications system. .     Electronic Warfare (EW):   measures which providefor important improvements in NATO&apos;s EW capability,including closer co-operation in research anddevelopment.h. Rationalisation:    co-operation for the procure-ment of equipment recommended in the LTDP programmes, whichwill be pursued to the greatest possible extent.i. Logistics:   measures which include improvedarrangements for logistic support in the areas tothe rear of the combat zone.15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALj.     Theatre Nuclear Modernisation:   NATO&apos;s theatrenuclear forces are being maintained and modernisedas necessary to preserve their deterrent effect.127. Heads of Government recognised that a vigorous andsustained effort is necessary to implement the LTDP.   For itspart the British Government believes that it is throughco-operative action that the Alliance&apos;s defence needs can mosteffectively be met; the United Kingdom is taking positive stepstowards implementation and will play a full role in thosemeasures requiring international co-operation.International Equipment Collaboration128. The LTDP has played an important part in the field ofinternational equipment planning.    The detailed considerationof many of the relevant aspects of the programme will be amatter for the NATO Conference of National Armaments Directors(CNAD).    The United Kingdom will continue to support practicalmeasures to make Alliance co-operation in defence equipmentmore effective and to seek in particular a more satisfactoryrelationship between Europe and North America in this importantfield.129. The Government is working in a number of important areaswith a view to establishing co-operative arrangements for thenext generation of weapon systems.    It gives full support tothe work of the independent European Programme Group (IEPG)16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwhere a number of potential programmes have been identified,including a new tactical combat aircraft, in which the Govern-ment believes that collective action by European countriescould benefit the Alliance.    This Group is the main focus ofco-operative equipment work in Europe.Other Alliance Co-operation130. In November 1978 the Eurogroup celebrated the tenthanniversary of its foundation.    Created as a result of a Britishinitiative it provides a valuable forum for the discussion ofAlliance issues of particular interest to Europe.    Its seventechnical subgroups continue to foster practical co-operation.In particular,Eurolog and Euromed are seeking closer collabora-tion in the field of logistics, and medical support in theNorthern Army Group (NORTHAG) area in which forces of fourEurogroup countries (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,Germany and Belgium) are deployed; Euro/NATO Training hasreached agreement on a range of joint training projects; and the stan-dards which Eurocom continues to develop for tactical communica-tions systems are gaining wider acceptance in the Alliance,thereby providing a good basis for interoperability.131. The NATO infrastructure programme continues to providethe essential fixed installations required to support increasingly17CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsophisticated weapon systems and items, such as hardenedshelters for RAF aircraft and radar installations in the UKAir Defence Ground Environment (UKADGE), are- at presentunder consideration for international funding.The United Kingdom fully supports the infrastructure programmewhich will in the coming years have a big part to play insupporting the Long-Term Befence -Programme.UNITED KINGDOM CONTRIBUTION TO NATO132.   The United Kingdom commits the great bulk of its forcesto the Alliance.    It is the only European country to commitforces to NATO in each of the three elements of the triad onwhich the Alliance&apos;s strategy of deterrence depends.   At thesame time the United Kingdom is one of the two Europeancountries which provide forces for all three major NATO Commands,and one of the few countries that commits forces to more thanone region of Allied Command Europe (ACE).    The United Kingdomcontinues to concentrate its efforts on those areas where its18CONFIDENTIAL
resources will most effectively aid collective Alliancedefence: the defence of the United Kingdom base and itsimmediate approaches; the Eastern Atlantic and Channel; theCentral Region of Europe; and the nuclear forces.133.   In the Central Region of Europe the United Kingdom provides55,000 men in the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). BA0R*sbalanced forces include over 600 Chieftain tanks and over 2,000other armoured fighting vehicles, and together with the rest ofORTHAG make a vital contribution to forward defence.    In timeof tension the strength of BAOR could rapidly be more than doubled,he United Kingdom provides a major part of NAT0&apos;s Second Alliedactical Air Force with 12 squadrons stationed in the CentralRegion in the strike, attack^ reconnaissance, air defence andelicopter support roles,     RAF Germany would also be quicklyeinforced in time of emergency.   NATO depends criticallyn the United Kingdom to provide the main weight of maritimeorces readily available in the Eastern Atlantic and Channelreas.     The Royal Navy has a vital role to play in these areas inelping to ensure the successful supply and reinforcement ofrope.   The Royal Navy contributes a total of over 100 majorrships of some 16 different classes.    28 RAF squadronsased in the United Kingdom are available for the air defencef the United Kingdom Air Defence Region and the Eastern Atlanticnd Channel areas, for anti-submarine and anti-surface ship attack,or strike and attack roles in support of ground forces, andor reconnaissance.    British forces also deploy a significantart of the theatre nuclear forces vital to NAT0&apos;s deterrent19CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL Jposture.    In addition, the United Kingdom contributes to NATOfsstrategic nuclear capability with the Polaris submarine force.The effectiveness of this force is being maintained.134. The United Kingdom maintains specialist reinforcementforces which are an important part of the Strategic Reserveof the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and includethe United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF), land and air contribu-tions to the ACE Mobile Force (AMF) and three regular squadronsof the Special Air Service.    Royal Marines Commando forces,with amphibious ships and helicopters, as part of the UnitedKingdom/Netherlands Amphibious Force, are assigned to the SupremoAllied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT), for operations in supportof NATO&apos;s Northern flank and the Atlantic Island Commands.135. In support of their NATO commitments, all three Serviceshave extensive re-equipment plans.   The first of the new classof large anti-submarine cruisers for the Royal Navy, HMSInvincible, is expected to enter service in 1980.   The secondcruiser, HMS Illustrious,    has been launched and the third,HI/IS Ark Royal, has been ordered.   The construction programmefor nuclear-powered fleet submarines continues.   The eleventhvessel, HMS Spartan, is due to enter service this year and threemore are under construction, including the first two submarinesof the new Trafalgar class.    It is planned to order a thirdTrafalgar class submarine this year.   Other warship classes underconstruction or entering service with the Royal Navy includeType 42 guided-missile destroyers, Type 22 anti-submarine frigatesand Hunt class mine countermeasures vessels.   These shipprogrammes are complemented by a range of new equipment and weapon20_CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALincluding the Sea Harrier aircraft, the Lynx helicopter, and theea Dart and Sea Wolf guided-missile systems.36.   A new British main battle tank is being developed toeplace Chieftain in the late 1980s.    In the meantime, thereill be further improvements to Chieftain. Anti-armourapability is being enhanced by the further deployment ofiilan and a helicopter-borne system,   the American TOW, iseing procured.   The FH70 towed 155 mm howitzer will be inervice later this year and a prototype of the self-propelledversion, SP70, has begun firing trials.    Work has begun onimprovements to the British anti-aircraft missile systems,Bapier and Blowpipe, which are already in service in BAOR.; Tl.   The multi-role combat aircraft Tornado will replace thev7&apos;xlcan and the Buccaneer in the overland and maritime strike/attack roles, Canberras in the reconnaissance role and the Phantomsand   Lightnings of the present air defence squadrons.    In the 1980stea Shackleton airborne early warning (AEW) aircraft will beprogressively replaced by a variant of the Nimrod aircraft.it is planned that these aircraft will form part ofthe integrated NATO AEW force which was approved at the Ministerialmeeting of the DPC held in December 1978.    Skyflash medium-rangeair-to-air missiles are entering serivce with the Royal Airce,   and the Sidewinder AIM 9L, an improved short-range-to-air missile, will also be procured.21CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL138.    In the course of the last year, a series of force improve-ments have been announced and warmly welcomed by the United Kingdom1:NATO Allies.   They include an increase in the planned sizeof the Army by 6,000, which will improve standards of trainingand readiness, particularly in EAOR; Westland Commando helicoptersto increase significantly the helicopter lift capability of theAmphibious Force;    33 Boeing-Vertol Chinook medium-lift helicoptersfor the Royal Air Force which will greatly enhance the logisticand tactical air lift for BAOR; VC10 aircraft to augment theair-to-air refuelling tanker fleet; and an additional squadronof Rapier surface-to-air missiles for the defence of the importantforward air base at Lossiemouth.OTHER TASKS139*   The Armed Forces also play their part in the generalcontext of the Government&apos;s efforts to promote internationalsecurity.UN Peacekeeping140.    In September 1978 the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryset out to the UN General Assembly the extent of the Governmentsoffer of support to future UN peacekeeping operations. Heexplained that if requested, and subject to national commitmentsand exigencies, and in addition to the United Kingdom&apos;s presentcommitment in Cyprus, the United Kingdom would make availablean infantry battalion group or Royal MarinesCommando group for upto six months.   This force would be available at seven days&apos;22CONFIDENTIAL
notice and the United Kingdom would airlift the force and itsequipment to the area of operations.   The United Kingdom wouldalso be willing to provide military personnel for duty asobservers.   Assistance with seaborne support would be providedwhenever possible, and the Government would consider assympathetically as possible requests for other types of forcesor military assistance.141.   The United Kingdom has continued its support forexisting UN forces.   British troops and armoured reconnaissanceand. helicopter units form part of the United Nations Force inCyprus (UNFICYP) and the United Kingdom provides logisticsupport from the Sovereign Base Areasfor the whole of UNFICYPand also for the UN Interim Force in the Lebanon (UNIFIL).In addition, RAF VC10 aircraft airlifted the Fijian contingentto the Lebanon in June 1978.Other Support42.   The United Kingdom also plays a significant part inpromoting security by helping the forces of friendly countriesto maintain and improve their effectiveness.    Officers and menof the British Services are seconded to serve with manyCommonwealth and foreign forces, and large numbers of personnelfrom these countries attend courses and receive training inthis country.   Advice is offered to other governments on requeston a wide range of military matters.    Practical aid ranges fromthe military assistance to -Zambia announced in October 1978,to the despatch of RAF transport aircraft at short noticei-n May 1978 to central Africa to assist in an ambulance rolei-n the evacuation of casualties from Zaire.23CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL2COMBAT FORCES, DEPLOYMENT,OPERATIONS AND EXERCISESNATOROYAL NAVY GENERAL PURPOSE COMBAT FORCES1201.   The United Kingdom and its NATO Allies are dependent onbhe free use of the world1s oceans.   Freedom of the Atlantic,n particular, is of crucial importance for reinforcements andesupply in time of war.   All the United Kingdom&apos;s major warshipsmd amphibious forces are assigned to NATO and the Royal Navy111 continue to provide the main weight of the maritime forcesImmediately available to NATO in the Eastern Atlantic and Channelivea.   The United Kingdom&apos;s maritime forces are largely designedtor anti-submarine operations but maintain significant airiefence and anti-ship capabilities.    The Royal Navy&apos;s task alsoj-ncludes countering the threat of mines in coastal waters, keeping;pen the submarine deployment routes and safeguarding the passageAllied reinforcements from the United Kingdom to continental-urope.   The United Kingdom naval forces are commanded by Commander-;n-Chief Fleet (CINCFLEET) who, in time of tension and war, wouldtlso command other Allied forces in the Channel area as the majorfATO commander, Commander-in-Chief Channel (CINCHAN), and in thefastern Atlantic as Commander-in-Chief Eastern AtlanticCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL(CINCEASTLANT), subordinate to the Supreme Allied CommanderAtlantic (SACLANT).202. The United Kingdom nevertheless retains the ability todeploy its maritime forces world-wide in defence of Allied ornational interests, and ships of the Royal Navy and supportingRoyal Fleet Auxiliaries (RFAs) are deployed for exercisesoutside the NATO area from time to time (although they are avail-able for recall by SACLANT at varying degrees of notice asnecessary.)   Nearer to home there is an important commitment tothe protection of the United Kingdom&apos;s fishing interests andNorth Sea oil and gas resources.203. Ships of the Hydrographic Survey Fleet continue to carryout surveys to meet specific defence requirements, to improveboth the United Kingdom&apos;s and NAT0&apos;s maritime operational capa-bility and to contribute to the safety of international navigation.In addition the Hydrographic Department received the Queen&apos;s Awardfor Export Achievement In 1978.204. Royal Marines Commando forces now consist of a Commandobrigade headquarters and four Royal Marines Commandos with combat,logistic and helicopter support.    Combat support is being improvedwith the introduction of new weapons and equipment.   As a resultof increased manpower cover announced for the Army in August 1978,full combat and logistic support can now be provided for all fourCommandos including 41 Commando RM which was re-formed in 1977.The brigade headquarters   and two Commandos with supporting armsand helicopters are now specially trained and equipped to operateon skis through the arctic winter in north Norway in conjunctionwith elements of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps. Agreementhas been reached with the Norwegian Government to stockpile2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALoversnow vehicles in north Norway from March 1979.   The navalsupport helicopter lift provided for Commando forces will beenhanced during 1979/80 by the introduction of a number of SeaKing Mk 4 helicopters in place of a similar number of WessexMk 5 helicopters in existing Commando squadrons.THE NUCLEAR STRATEGIC FORCE205.   The Polaris submarines, HMS Renown, Repulse, Resolutionand Revenge, between them provide a continuous patrol as theUnited Kingdom&apos;s contribution to NAT0&apos;s strategic deterrent.ARMY COMBAT FORCES206c   In time of war the Army would have two main tasks: thedefence of the European mainland, in concert with the UnitedKingdom&apos;s NATO Allies; and the defence of the United Kingdombass.,   In peacetime forces are maintained both on the continent -the British Army of the Rhine - and at home - the United KingdomLand Forces (UKLF).207,   In order to fulfil these tasks the Regular Army would, intime of emergency, be augmented by regular reservists (ex-ServicePersonnel) and the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR).The improvement of procedures for the recall of regular reservistsis currently under study, with the aim of further reducing thetime required for their mobilisation.British Army of the Rhinp208-   The permanent combat element of BAOR is the 1st (British)3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCorps (1 (BR) Corps), which consists of four armoured divisions,an artillery division and the 5th Field Force (less certainelements which are based in the United Kingdom in peacetime).In time of war these would be reinforced from UKLF by the 7thField Force; by other United Kingdom-based units, includingcertain TAVR units; by individual reservists; and by individualsfrom the training and support organisation.   After full mobilisa-tion up to 70% of Army forces would be deployed to the Europeanmainland. ;209. These forces combine with German, Dutch and Belgiancorps to form NORTHAG which,    as part ofAllied Forces Central Europe, is responsible for the defence ofthe north German plain, a vital sector of the Central Region.United Kingdom Land Forces210. In addition to providing reinforcements for BAOR UKLFwould in wartime provide forces to form part of SACEUR&apos;sStrategic Reserve in any part of ACE in which they might berequired.    These would include about 1,800 men forming theUnited Kingdom&apos;s contribution to the land component of the AMF;the 6th Field Force and the Logistic Support Group forming theUKMF; and 22 Special Air Service Regiment.    The Army alsoassists Royal Marines Commando forces assigned to SACLANT, byproviding support and logistic troops.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL211.   Almost all the remaining forces would perform varioushome defence roles in the United Kingdom, which would be crucialin maintaining the war effort, providing a base both for thereinforcement of mainland forces and for maritime and airoperations.   Specific responsibilities for the protection ofvital NATO and national installations and bases would beassigned to all Regular Army and TAVR units remaining in theUnited Kingdom.    The whole of the 8th Field Force, which is basedin South West district, is maintained for this role. Manpowerwould be released from the training and support organisation tosupplement these forces, together with additional reservists.212c   The 6th and 7th Field Forces, based in South East and EasternDistricts respectively, assumed their operational role as plannedon 1 April 1978.    They and the 8th Field Force comprise bothR . ilar Army and TAVR units.Berlin Field Force21:    The 3,000 men of the Berlin Field Force continue to fulfilti   United Kingdom &apos;s commitment to the security of the westernsectors of Berlin; this force is not committed to NATO.ROYAL AIR FORCE COMBAT FORCES214,   All RAF combat and transport aircraft and ground-basedmissile systems, with the sole exception of the helicoptersquadrons in Cyprus and Hong Kong, are either assigned to NATO5CONFIDENTIAL

They aredeployed first and foremost to protect those areas in whichthe United Kingdom can best contribute to Alliance defence:the Channel and Eastern Atlantic areas and the Central andUnited Kingdom Air Defence Regions of ACE.   Numbers of front-line aircraft have been maintained over the past year and willincrease during 1979 as former RN aircraft are incorporatedinto RAF squadrons.215. Combat and transport forces are organised into twooperational commands - Strike Command and RAF Germany. Theoperational Commanders-in-Chief have, in addition to theirnational appointments, responsibilities as subordinate commander,under SACEUR - thus integrating national and NATO commandstructures.Strike Command Forces in the United Kingdom216. The Commander-in-Chief Strike Command also holds the NATOappointment of Commander-in-Chief United Kingdom Air Forces,and as such is responsible for the air defence of the UnitedKingdom and naval units and shipping in the surrounding waters.Strike Command also provides offensive aircraft in support ofSACEUR and the maritime operations of the other major NATOcommanders, CINCHAN and SACLANT.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL217.   Strike Command aircraft are organised into four groups.No. 1 Group provides strike/attack aircraft for both SACEURand SACLANT including the Vulcan bombers and the Buccaneerforce.   During 1979 an additional Buccaneer squadron will beformed from former RN aircraft and will become operationalearly in 1980.   No. 1 Group is also responsible for maritimeIradar and photographic reconnaissance - using Vulcans andCanberras - and for the Victor K2 tankers which support airdefence and offensive operations.218.   No. 11 Group provides seven squadrons of Phantom and.,:Lghtning all-weather fighters for the air defence of theJnited Kingdom, including one squadron of Phantoms which isJffiployed for maritime air defence.    The Group also operatessquadron of Shackleton AEW aircraft   and the United Kingdomround radar sj^stem, including the Ballistic Missile Earlyarning station at RAF Fylingdales.   No. 18 Group providesfimrod long-range maritime patrol aircraft, whose main taskmaritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare. Theselircraft also perform fishery protection duties, patrol theforth Sea oil rigs, and complement 18 Group!s Sea King,urlwind and Wessex helicopters in the search and rescue role.(the offensive support role, No. 38 Group provides threeuadrons of Jaguar and one squadron of Harrier aircraft forCEUR&quot;s Strategic Reserve (Air).    Of these four squadrons,CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALone Harrier squadron is assigned to AMF; andone Jaguar squadron operating within No. 38 Group is assignedto UK Mobile Force.   No. 38 Group also provides the RAF*stransport fleet of VC10 and Hercules aircraft, together withPuma and Wessex support helicopters.RAF Germany219. The Commander-in-Chief RAF Germany also holds the NATOappointment of Commander of the Second Allied Tactical AirForce, to which all RAF Germany aircraft are assigned. RAFGermany maintains two squadrons of Buccaneer aircraft and fivesquadrons of Jaguars in the strike/attack and reconnaissanceroles and two squadrons of Harriers, operating from dispersedfield sites, which provide close air support for NORTHAG. Twosquadrons of Phantom interceptor aircraft are available for airdefence, and police north German airspace in peacetime. RAFGermany is one of the United Kingdom&apos;s major contributions toNATO, and RAF bases and squadrons continue to achieve consist-ently high ratings in NATO tactical evaluation exercises.Indeed, RAF Bruggen was in 1978 awarded the highest possiblemarking - the first time that this feat has ever been achievedin ACE.   A squadron of Wessex helicopters supports 1 (BR) Corpsand a second squadron is available as reinforcement from theUnited Kingdom.Airfield Survival Measures220.

Aprogramme for the construction of shelters at selected RAF air-fields in the United Kingdom will begin in 1979; they are designedto meet NATO criteria and wiTl be largely financed from common NATOinfrastructure funds.   The RAF Regiment field squadrons, whichprotect RAF bases and dispersed sites in Germany and the UnitedKingdom, will be re-equipped with Spartan and Scorpion trackedcombat vehicles.   A further RAF Regiment field squadron wasformed during 1978.EXERCISES IN SUPPORT OF NATO221, In accordance with United Kingdom defence policy, all threeServices have given priority to NATO exercises in 1978. TheLTDP studies included an examination of ways to improve NATOexercises and make available better facilities. Measuresare now being taken to achieve this.Eastern Atlantic/Channel Area222. The major exercise of the year, NORTHERN V/EDDING 78, wasstaged in northern waters in September 1978.    This large-scaleamphibious reinforcement exercise formed part of the annualAUTUMN FORGE Exercise Series which comprises both NATO andnational exercises.9CONFIDENTIAL

The exercise was designed to demonstrate the readinessand effectiveness of NATO*s forces in conducting maritime,amphibious and air operations and the Alliance&apos;s determinationto improve operational techniques.    The United Kingdom*s contri-bution consisted of 34 warships, including HMS Ark Royal andHMS Hermes, HQ 3 Commando brigade RM and a complete RM Commandogroup and elements of 29 squadrons of aircraft.Northern Region224. In September 1978, the 6th Field Force and RAF Herculesaircraft took part in exercise BOLD GUARD 78, to practiseexternal reinforcement of Allied Forces Baltic Approaches inSchleswig Holstein.    In March 1979, the United Kingdom willtake part in exercise COLD WINTER, demonstrating NATO&apos;s abilityto operate in the arctic north.    Units of all three Services,including all elements of RM Commando forces trained in mountainand arctic warfare, will be involved.Central Region1 225.   BAOR units have participated in three NATO and 36 nationalexercises.    The annual Central Region combined land/airexercise COLD FIRE 78 took place in September 1978. 20,000members of the TAVR exercised in Germany in 1978, 3,000 morethan last year.

In 1978/79 total United Kingdom deployment exceeded55.000 servicemen and 250 aircraft in support of ACE.UNITED KINGDOMOPERATIONSNorthern Ireland230.    The Armed Forces have continued to support the Royal UlsterConstabulary (RUC) in the maintenance of law and order inNorthern Ireland.    Security force activities have continued to bedirected towards bringing terrorists to justice through the ordinarfprocesses of the law and to this end increased emphasise in militarfoperations&quot; has been placed on intelligence-gathering activities. ^Armed Forces have maintained their high standards of courage,resourcefulness and vigilance.

There have been prolonged lulls in terrorist activity duringthe year, alternating with outbursts of violence.    The overallincidence of violence has decreased.    The total number of deathsfell by over one third and the total number of injuries by almostone half; the number of shooting incidents also declined. Largelyas a result of the renewed bombing campaign at the end of 1978 thenumber of bombing incidents rose by some 18%, and an increased weightof explosives was used.    In 1978      843       people were chargedwith terrorist-type offences, including      139     with murder orattempted murder.    The security forces found    400 firearms,43s511 rounds of ammunition and three and a half tons of explosive(including neutralised devices).232:   The Army has continued to bear the major responsibilityin assisting the police.   A fifth resident battalion was intro-duced in September 1978 although the overall force level hasremained at 13 major units of the combat arms.    A total of 41units served in the province in 1978; nine major units have nowcompleted seven tours and one unit has completed eight tours.The other Services also make an important contribution tooperations in Northern Ireland.

The UDR provides immediate military support for the RUCin 11 Police Divisions.   Recruitment to implement the build-upof the permanent cadre approved last year is going well. 15full-time platoons are now operational, and another has alimited operational capability.    The total strength at 1 January1979, including both full-time and part-time members was  &quot; Jof whom  &quot;      J were women.    Although there was no generalcall-up in 1978, members of one UDR battalion were called outfor a period of full-time service in support of the Regular Army.Further Assistance to the Civil Power234. Bomb disposal teams from all three Services have continuedto be available to assist local police forces in the event ofbomb incidents in Great Britain.    The counter-terrorist securityarrangements at major airports involve the deployment of troops,provided by a standby Army unit, from time to time in supportof the police.    One example was the provision of extra securityat Heathrow for the Egyptian and Israeli delegations attendingthe Leeds Castle talks.Air Defence Operations235.

CONFIDENTIALb. Lightweight Torpedoes. Work on the Stingray develop-ment programme is continuing with the aim of producinga lightweight torpedo capable of being launchedfrom surface ships, RAF Nimrod aircraft, andhelicopters.c. Sonars.   New sonars are being developed andfitted to improve the capabilities of ships, submarinesand helicopters to detect and classify submarines.Anti-Surface Ship Warfare308.    The number of major Soviet surface units, and theircapabilities, have steadily increased over recent years and thayare now deployed world-wide, many across lines of communicationvital to the defence of the West in time of conflict or crisis.These forces are equipped with a considerable variety of highlyadvanced weapon systems, including long-range anti-ship missiles.They are now complemented by modern support vessels andamphibious forces, which have increased the Soviet Union1sconventional capability in global terms.    To counter thiscapability, the Royal Navy&apos;s major surface vessels have ananti-surface ship capability as do its nuclear-powered fleetsubmarines.    In addition, the United Kingdom operates a forceof maritime strike/attack aircraft.    Improvements are in handto enhance the anti-surface ship capabilities of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s maritime forces.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL9.   Anti-Surface Ship AircraftBuccaneer.   During the year improvements will be made toe navigation systems of aircraft of the two RAF maritimepport Buccaneer squadrons, and the Paveway/Pavespike laser-ided weapon system will be introduced.0.   Anti-Surface Ship Weaponsa. Sub-Harpoon.    This long-range anti-ship missilecan be launched from submerged submarines.    It willbe the principal anti-ship armament of the Royal Navy&apos;snuclear-powered fleet submarines when it enters servicein the early 1980s.b. Exocet.   The installation of the Exocet medium-range missile as part of the frigate modernisationprogramme will significantly improve the Fleet&apos;s anti-surface ship capability.c. Sea Skua.

The resultsof joint feasibility studies are under considerationin conjunction with a number of NATO Allies for thedevelopment of a family of anti-ship missilescapable of being launched from a variety of platforms -ships, aircraft and submarines - and coming intoservice from about 1990 onwards.Mine Warfare311.    The Soviet Union has a wide range of naval mines whichcan be laid by submarines, surface ships or aircraft. TheUnited Kingdom is continuing to build up the specialist forcesnecessary to counter any threat which these might pose in wartimeto its own ship and submarine deployment.a. Mine Countermeasures Vessels.   HMS Brecon, thefirst of the Hunt class of advanced mine counter-measures vessels, is due to enter service with theRoyal Navy later this year.    The second vessel,Ledbury, will be launched in 1979.    Further vesselsare to be ordered.b. EDATS Trawlers. To counteract the increasingthreat of minelaying in deeper waters, procurement8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALis planned this year of a new class of    12 ExtraDeep Armed Team Sweep vessels based on a commercialtrawler design.   Meanwhile, two trawlers have beenchartered in order that experience of operatingEDATS may be gained.c.     Hovercraft.    The Royal Navy is continuing tostudy the potential uses of the hovercraft, particularlyas a mine countermeasures vessel or in support of minecountermeasures operations.   It is planned to evaluatethe feasibility of these support operations in the nearfuture.hore ProtectionThe United Kingdom needs ships and aircraft to safeguardvaluable offshore resources.    Improvements in the forceslable for the task include:a.     Island Class Patrol Vessels.   Two more IslandClass patrol vessels are due to enter service thisyear for a variety of tasks including coastalfishery protection.h*     New Offshore Patrol Vessel.   Design studiesare in hand for a new offshore patrol vessel whichit is planned to introduce in the early 1980s tosucceed the Ton class vessels used for coastalfishery protection.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHydrofoils313. A Boeing Jetfoil has been ordered to enable the RoyalNavy to carry out technical trials with this type of vessel,and to evaluate the hydrofoil concept in a number of roles.Initially it will be tested on offshore protection duties.Fleet Support Systems314. To be able to operate effectively the Fleet requiresextensive support facilities. Major new additions includethe following:a.     Royal Fleet Auxiliary Vessels.   The RFA FortAustin will enter service this year.    It is plannedto order two support tankers soon.b.     Maritime Navigation Systems.   A comprehensiveship-fitting programme is planned to provide warshipswith computer-assisted navigation facilities,including advanced satellite navigation systems.Amphibious Operations315.    The United Kingdom attaches great importance to itscommitment to provide Royal Marines amphibious forces for the10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIeinforcement of the northern flank of NATO and the Atlanticislands. Improvements to the mobility and fire-power of theforces include:-a.     Amphibious Lift.    It has been decided to convertthe RFA ship Tarbatness for amphibious tasks insupport of RM Commando forces during 1979.    The shipwill have the capacity to accommodate and land aCommando group, carry its own landing craft andoperate helicopters from a small flight deck.b. Helicopter Lift.    To provide the Royal Marineswith an improved operational lift capability, includingthe ability to lift light guns and oversnow vehicles,15 Westland Commando helicopters have been ordered.For their service role, they have been designatedSea King Mk 4s.   First deliveries will commence latein 1979.c. Weapons.   RM Commando forces have now receivedan initial issue of Milan and Blowpipe missiles.TOW, the helicopter-borne anti-tank guided weapon,is to be adopted by Commando forces and the systemwill enter service fitted to RM Lynx helicopters inthe early 1980s. Commando forces have also beenequipped with the 105mm light gun, which has a rangeand accuracy far exceeding that of its predecessorthe 105mm pack howitzer, and is already in servicewith non-Commando forces.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALd.     Oversnow Mobility.    Improved oversnow vehicleshave been procured to improve the mobility of theCommando forces when operating in the Arctic.Maritime Air Warfare316. With the introduction of further ships of the Kiev classof aircraft carrier into service, the Soviet navy will continueto improve its anti-submarine and anti-surface shipping capabili-ties.   This is in addition to the support it already receivesfrom the large land-based Soviet naval air force, which hasrecently been equipped with supersonic swingwing Backfirebombers.   As a consequence the air threat in the Norwegian Seaand Eastern Atlantic to NATO&apos;s supply and reinforcement routeshas greatly increased.    In particular, attacking aircraft,assisted by information from satellites and other detectionmethods, will be able to pin-point the position of fightingships and other vessels and to launch sophisticated air-to-surface missiles.   This threat would be countered by a concertedresponse from RN warships, together with RN and RAF aircraft.317. Ships and Aircrafta.     Type 42 Guided-Missile Destroyers.   Four Type 42s,whose primary role is area air defence, are now inservice.   HMS Cardiff and HMS Glasgow are due to join theFleet this year, and four more are under construction.An order has been placed for the eleventh ship to aslightly modified design, and further orders to thisspecification will be made this year.12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. Sea Harrier. The Sea Harrier1s primary rolewill be air defence, although, armed with theP3T air-to-surface missile,it could undertake anti-ship missions.   The aircraft, which will enterfront-line service with the Royal Navy in 1980, willbe fitted with the Blue Fox search radar and willcarry Sidewinder Aim 9L air-to-air missiles givingit a quick reaction capability against enemy aircraft.Following successful trials, it is now intended toinstall in HMS Hermes and the anti-submarine cruisers,a &apos;ski jump&apos; launching ramp, which will significantlyenhance the operational performance of the Sea Harrier.Ship-Borne Air Defence Weaponsa. Sea Dart.    This medium-range surface-to-airguided missile system, which also has a secondarysurface-to-surface capability, was accepted into opera-tional service last year, and is being fitted in allType 42 destroyers and the new anti-submarine cruisers.To meet developments in the air threat, an improvementprogramme is in hand.b. Sea Wolf.   Production of Sea Wolf continues.This system will provide the Type 22 frigates andother ships with an advanced close-range self-defencecapability against fast low-flying anti-ship missilesand aircraft.   Programmes are under way to ensure13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthat Sea Wolfs effectiveness is maintained asthe threat develops in the future.Land-Based Air Defence319. The Soviet Union has an increasing capability for offensiveair operations against NATO forces on the European mainland, inthe United Kingdom and in adjacent sea areas.   The UnitedKingdom&apos;s own land-based air defence forces are thereforedesigned to cover the United Kingdom, its surrounding seas andthe Central Front.    The United Kingdom would be of vitalstrategic importance to the Alliance in war as a base forreceiving and mounting reinforcements both by sea and, increas-ingly, by air; for air defence and maritime patrol; and as abase for a substantial part of ACE&apos;s strike/attack aircraft.A wide range of improvements to the United Kingdom&apos;s air defenceforces is therefore in progress to protect these vital interests.320. Aircraft and Weaponsa. Tornado F2.    The first flight of the Tornado F2air defence variant development aircraft, three ofwhich are currently under construction, should takeplace later this year.   Flight trials work on theair-intercept radar is progressing satisfactorily.b. Nimrod AEW.   Work is in progress on the firstthree of the 11 Nimrod aircraft to be converted to theAEW role and on the development of the mission systemavionics.   A Comet aircraft fitted with a prototype14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALradar has been undergoing trials since mid-1977and flight trials of the integrated radar and datahandling system are due to start next year. TheNimrod AEW aircraft will be interoperable to themaximum extent possible with the Boeing E3A aircraftacquired by other NATO nations.   They will representa significant improvement in air defence capability,permitting the detection at long range of low-levelattack aircraft approaching the United Kingdom andof maritime forces.c. VC10 tankers.    A programme to convert ninerecently purchased VC10 aircraft to the tanker roleis now under way.    They are due to enter service inthe early 1980s, supplementing the Victor K2 tankersquadrons, and will provide a significant addition tothe Royal Air Force&apos;s air-to-air refuelling capability.They will operate primarily in support of air defenceoperations.d. Air-to-Air missiles.    Skyflash medium-range air-to-air missiles are entering service on RAF Phantoms tosupplement the less advanced Sparrow; Skyflash willlater equip the Tornado F2.   These aircraft will alsohe equipped with AIM 9L short-range missiles toincrease their air-to-air combat capability. TheUnited Kingdom has joined a European consortium whichwill manufacture the AIM 9L missile.15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL321. Ground-Based Air Defence Equipmenta. The United Kingdom Air Defence GroundEnvironment (UKADGE).   Development work has begun onthe improvement of UKADGE facilities and will becompleted by the mid-1980s.   Work is also in handwhich will lead to the re-equipment of all radar sitesand     the establishment of a new site in south-westEngland    with modern three-dimensional radar sensors.Much of the work is to be supported by contributionsfrom NATO common infrastructure funds.b. Ground-Based Missile Defences. The coverage ofthe Bloodhound system within the United Kingdom willbe extended by redeploying the squadron currently in GermanyAn additional RAF Regiment Rapier squadron will becomeoperational in the United Kingdom during the yearand the Rapier squadrons in RAF Germany will pro-gressively be equipped with Blindfire to give anall-weather capability.Air Operations in Support of Land Warfare322. In the event of an attack anywhere upon the NATO Alliancea capability to locate and strike the enemy from the air willbe a vital factor in defence.    In the Central Region the directapplication of air power can destroy or delay armour, and providefire support against other targets in the battlefield area.16 ICONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALn addition, it would be necessary to counter the opposingir effort at source by: denying the use of airfields;isrupting communications and the deployment of second echelonits; and striking at base and support areas.    In performinghese tasks NATO aircraft will have to face a formidable airefence system, deployed in depth and utilising the radar-ontrolled guns and surface-to-air missiles of mobile unitsd fixed sites.    The United Kingdom&apos;s re-equipment plans areesigned to enable aircraft to survive in this increasinglyostile environment.23,   Aircraft and Weaponsa. Tornado GR 1.   By the end of 1978 the tri-nationalflight test programme had amassed some     2,400 hours.A further batch of production aircraft has been authorisedby the nations which will increase the present totalproduction order for the three nations to 317 aircraft.The first production aircraft is due to enter RAFservice in 1980. With an all-weather, low-level, day and night role the Tornado GR 1 willrepresent a significant improvement in the Royal AirForce&apos;s capability to fulfil t;he tasks assigned to itby SACEUR and SACLANT.b. Harrier.   Deliveries of 24 new aircraft to maintainfront-line strengths will start this year. Preliminarystudies into the feasibility of fitting a larger wingto improve range, payload and manoeuvrability, have17CONFIDENTIAL

The Government is engaged in discussions with Britishindustry and with the United Kingdom&apos;s Allies on further weaponsystems to be developed through international collaboration.In some cases these are intended to be the successors of systemswhich were themselves collaboratively developed or otherwiseacquired through international co-operation.    The main focusis on future military helicopters, anti-ship and anti-tank28CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmissiles and combat aircraft.   But collaborative work, atvarious stages, is also in hand in other fields including air-to-air and ground-to-air missiles, torpedoes and air-to-groundmunitions.   It is expected that collaborative programmes willprovide many significant parts of the United Kingdom&apos;s armouryin the last two decades of the century.539.   The Government*s long-term procurement policy is intendedto improve the use of the money and other resources availablelo meet the Services&apos; needs for equipment; to maintain andItimulate British industry, especially in areas of high technologyhich are important to the whole economy; and to increase theilitary effectiveness of the Alliance through greater standard-sation and interoperability.    The United Kingdom&apos;s Allies haveimilar objectives and inevitably national industrial interestsLmes conflict when future programmes are being planned.i United States, France and the Federal Republic of Germany,P    the United Kingdom, are capable of designing and manufactur-g a very wide range of weapon systems; other countries haveslier industrial capabilities.   The business of co-operationis   . knit together the resources and interests of the separateButrtries in a mutually satisfactory way, to make the best useI the defence resources of the Alliance as a whole. MuchBisultation is taking place with the United Kingdom&apos;s AlliesH possible future programmes and on general aspects ofBLlaboration in fora like the CNAD and the IEPG and through fre-Int more informal contacts.   As recorded in Chapter 1, the29CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdecision by Heads of Government on the NATO LTDP last year havefurther stimulated co-operation in defence equipment matters.THE DEFENCE EQUIPMENT PROGRAMME AND INDUSTRY340. In 1977/78 the Ministry of Defence spent jt jmillion on defence equipment.    Of this about     75%    was spenton national contracts placed with British industry, about 15% asUnited Kingdom&apos;s share of collaborative projects and about 10% oilcontracts placed overseas.    Of the payments made directly bythe Ministry of Defence to contractors in the United Kingdomthe bulk, about    1,900   million, went to the   43 firms(including the ROFs), listed at Annex     J     as each receivingmore than      5 million.341. The defence equipment programme continues to sustainabout     200,000     full-time job opportunities in the defenceindustries; and overseas sales sustain about 70,000 to 75*000In addition, purchases by defence suppliers in support of themanufacture of equipment sustain roughly the same numbers ofjob opportunities in industry generally.342. The Ministry of Defence maintains close links withindustry at all levels.    In addition to day-to-day contactsarising from the normal process of project management, theMinistry consults industry on a wide range of policy issues,30CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALncluding future equipment programmes.    The National Defencendustries Council, meeting under the chairmanship of theecretary of State for Defence, remains the main forum foriscussions at the most senior level between the Ministry andndustry.   The Ministry also has a continuing programme ofleetings between senior officials and Board members of majorefence suppliers to discuss general policy issues of commonnterest.   It is also seeking to increase the number ofxchanges of MOD personnel with industry.ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIESi,h3&apos;   The ROFs organisation continues to operate successfullyder a trading fund, meeting its financial objective and makingurther provision for reserves.    Its output in real termsontinues to rise and, on present forecast, a steady workloads    pected for some years ahead, including substantial ordersrom overseas customers.    The organisation^ performance in thisield was again recognised in 1978, by the granting of Theuei i&apos;s Award for Export Achievement.-   The ROF manufacturing programme in 1979/80, over halfwaich, in value, will be for export, will includecured fighting vehicles;     artillery; thebat engineer tractor;     small arms;     a widelety of ammunition;   fuzes, safety and arming units;31CONFIDENTIAL

The organisation will also be associated with a numberof important development programmes including the Chieftainreplacement (MET 80) and the SP 70 howitzer.345. Capital investment in the factories continues to increase.Schemes include manufacturing facilities for Tornado aircraftcannon and ammunition and for the new airfield attack weapon;completion of replacement of manufacturing facilities for smallarms ammunition; and in the longer term, in consultation withR&amp;D establishments, the replacement of manufacturing facilitiesfor gun propellant..    DEFENCE SALES346. Overseas sales of defence equipment and associatedservices cover a wide range of items produced by British industryand the ROFs.   The Defence Sales Organisation provides support,assistance and advice.    These sales continue to make a substantialcontribution to the country&apos;s balance of payments. Equipmentsales will probably amount to about /&quot;&quot;         J million in 1979/80&apos;Since April 1977 International Military Services (formerly knownas Millbank Technical Services) has been the responsibility ofthe Secretary of State for Defence.    It works closely with the32CONFIDENTIAL

In 1979/80 defence research is expected to cost about  f     J million.    The programme extends from advancingscience and technology of military potential to the initiationand evaluation of new weapon concepts forming the basis ofoperational staff targets, against which feasibility studiesand full scale development can be undertaken.    It covers awide range of activities, including experimental work andexploratory development.   Defence research is carried out inR &amp; D establishments and under contract in industry anduniversities.    One of its main objectives is to investigateand resolve any major scientific and technical uncertaintiesbefore the MOD embarks on expensive development.3^8.   Civil aerospace programmes are undertaken and managed by theMinistry of Defence on behalf of the Department of Industry and 1iie CivilAviation Authority under repayment arrangements.   Much of theresearch serves civil and defence objectives in varyingProportions, and in these areas joint programmes are possibleWlth appropriate shares of the costs being met by the civil33CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALauthorities; in other cases they are run as separate civilprogrammes.   The transfer in 1977 of responsibilities forcertain aspects of research from the Department of Industry toBritish Aerospace has led to an arrangement whereby the latterwill provide funds for part of the programme.    As regards othernational civil requirements,     wherever possiblethe facilities and capabilities maintained for defence purposesare made available on repayment terms to public and industrialconcerns.   Receipts for such repayment work are expected to bein the region of f&amp;^J million in 1979/80.349. The reorganisation of the headquarters of the ControllerR&amp;D Establishments and Research (CER) has been completed.Responsibility for the overall direction and control of theresearch programme remains with the reorganised headquartersunder CER, but responsibility for the detailed formulation andmanagement of the programme has been delegated to the R&amp;Destablishments.350. As a result of the studies of the civil requirements forthe Microbiological Research Establishment (MRE) at Portonreported in the 1978 Statement on the Defence Estimates(Cmnd 7099), it has been agreed (subject to legislation) thatMRE should, from 1 April 1979, become a civil establishmentforming part of the Public Health Laboratory Service responsibleto the Department of Health and Social Security.    This will34CONFIDENTIAL

The Ministry&apos;s high level forum for considering major&quot;esearch issues, the Defence Research Committee, has been replacedy a new body, the Defence Research and Intramural Resourcesommittee, with wider terms of reference and membership thants 3 -edecessor.    It will provide guidance on the contentd priorities of the research programme and ensure that theeeds and aspirations of the Services are reflected in theormulation of the programme.52.   Particular emphasis is laid on keeping abreast ofcientific developments of relevance to defence, and encouraginginks between defence scientists and those engaged in otherlelds.   The Defence Scientific Advisory Council, the Aeronauticalesearch Council and the Electronics Research Council providein which scientists at the R&amp;D Establishments andeadquarters can obtain advice from their industrial andPcademic colleagues.35CONFIDENTIAL

About half the totalorder of 175 Hawks have now been delivered; the remainder will beused for weapons training to supplement and later replace theHunter.    To cater for a larger student intake, extra facilitieshave been made available at Lossiemouth to supplement theTactical Weapons Unit (TWU) at Brawdy pending the establishmentof permanent facilities for a second TWU at Chivenor in 1980.During 1979 the Gazelle will replace the Whirlwind as thebasic helicopter training aircraft.The increased requirement for pilots will necessitate theupgrading of a third Basic Flying Training School at ChurchFenton in Yorkshire and the use of RAF Lindholme as an additionalrelief landing ground later this year.   Additional trainingcapacity will also be provided by the use of RAF Swinderby as arelief landing ground.Following a major review, revised arrangements for low-flying training in the United Kingdom were introduced on 1 January1979.

Bilateral arrangements have been made between the UnitedKingdom and certain other NATO nations to provide logisticassistance to support the movement of troops and supplies to contiaental Europe   in times of tension or war.    To ensure that thesearrangements can operate concurrently and in harmony with thelogistic plans of other nations, the United Kingdom has recentlygiven its support to NATO proposals for co-ordinating the linesof communication and logistic support planned for each nation&apos;sreinforcements.504. Also under examination is the provision, for military andeconomic reasons, of collaborative logistic support for equipmentused by more than one nation&apos;s forces.    Several existing weaponsystems and equipments are already the subject of collaborativesupport agreements but it is important that the prospects forsuch collaboration in support of new equipments are identifiedat an early stage in their development; all new common weaponprojects in which the United Kingdom participates will beexamined to this end.    The precise form whichcollaboration will take will vary from weapon to weapon but itis agreed that first consideration should be given to the useof the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) for theprovision of spares and maintenance wherever possible.CONFIDENTIAL

In-service support for all fixed-wing aircrafts now concentrated at RAF St Athan, RAF Abingdon and RAF Kemble.echanical components and certain engines of fixed-wing aircraftre repaired at RAF St Athan and avionic equipment at RAFealand.15. It was announced early in 1978 that there would be a majoredevilopment of RAF Bentley Priory and detailed planningontinues.   It has been decided not to proceed with the proposalo form a ground radio engineering support unit at RAF Benson,owever, a study into the function and future organisation ofSupport Command Signals Headquarters (SCSHQ) at Bensonits links with other related units is now being considered.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALADP516. The RAF Supply Computer Services have been extended tocover seven RN shore-based establishments operating orservicing aircraft and three major flying units of theProcurement Executive.    The extension of the RAF Hendoncomputer records to include items being used or stored atRAF stations, as v/ell as those held in unit stores, has improvedmanagement information and effectiveness.517. Accumulated data from Harrier operations, held at theRAF Maintenance Data Centre, is being used by RN staffs for anassessment of the reliability of systems in the new Sea Harrierfor various operational scenarios.Other Developments in the Services1 Support Organisations518. A new squadron of the Royal Corps of Transport, 66 SquadronRCT, was formed on 1 October 1978, and is based at Tidworth.This addition will improve the Army&apos;s mobilisation capabilityand assist peace-time training of Field Forces in the UnitedKingdom.519. Specialist RAF support staffs are continuing the task ofpreparing for the introduction and support of new aircraft and- 8CONFIDENTIAL

The Inception Reporting&quot;ocedure, first used in 1974, is now being applied to all major;w projects including Tornado.   Efforts to refine the procedurentinue with the improvement of the associated computer-basedthematical model.ival Dockyards!0.   The Royal Naval Dockyards at Chatham, Devonport, Portsmouthd Rosyth are together the largest industrial organisationoily within central government.   Within them is concentratede major part of the nation&apos;s capacity for repairing andfitting its warships.    The Government intends to maintain theesent organisation of the dockyards, which will therefore remainthin the Ministry of Defence, working in close association withe Royal Navy.   The work of refitting and repairing ships,i-ch enables them to be maintained at a high state of operationalaess, includes the installation of improvements to theirShting capability to match the growing maritime threat.BV-   Although the Royal Navy has fewer ships than it once had,^Jre aas not been a commensurate reduction in the workload of theMral Dockyards.   The ships are both more complex and more subjectrapid technological change than they used to be. Moreover9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe Royal Navy nowadays requires and obtains much higher rates ofutilisation from its ships than used to be the case. Forexample, the average periods spent at sea by ships of theRoyal Navy&apos;s combined destroyer and frigate force in 1957,1967   and 1977, were, respectively, 1,970, 2,760 and 2,810hours per ship.522. During the forthcoming year work on guided-missile destroyersand larger ships will continue at Portsmouth, which also has asupporting programme of refitting work on patrol submarines,destroyers and frigates.    The refitting and refuelling of nuclearsubmarines will remain the major tasks of Chatham and Rosyth, inaddition to their supporting programmes of refit work on destroyersand frigates.   Devonport will begin its programme of nuclearsubmarine refits with HMS Swiftsure, and the yard will continue toundertake a major share of the Leander class frigate modernisations,as well as the support of other frigates and patrol submarines.523. Advanced propulsion systems, sensors and weapons will increasinglyassociated with computer-based control systems and command facil-ities.    Automation is being continuously extended in all fields.Major capital investment programmes to enable the dockyards tokeep abreast of these changes are now well on the way to completi*with assets now in course of construction (some of which will, 0^course, replace existing assets) valued at over  80 million.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlor the future provide for the expenditure of some  25 millionyear on fixed assets over the next 10 years; this is equal tobout 8% of the value of annual output.I24.   It is the Government&apos;s aim to maintain numbers employed inhe dockyards at approximately the present level throughout theorthcoming year, although difficulties continue to be experienced inecruiting and retaining a work force in each dockyard with theight mix of specialised skills.    There is also a backlog ofork.   Increased use is therefore currently being made of theip repair facilities in &quot;commercial&apos; yards (both those ofritish Shipbuilders and those in the private sector). Thetent of the continued use of these facilities will depend, inart, on the extent to which productivity in the Royal Dockyardsan be improved, so as to increase their output.Pgot tat ions are proceeding with the trade unions with a viewintroducing a new productivity scheme.    The Ministry ofenee is also seeking to idenitfy performance indicators- Dockyards similar to those being introduced for nationalisedIndustries.m al-LiX -As suranc eJ5.   following a detailed examination of the possibility ofJalgamating the Quality Assurance Directorate (Weapons) and theality Assurance Directorate (Fighting Vehicles and Engineeruipment), the first steps in the reorganisation were taken onJanuary 1979 With the introduction of a new Quality Assurance11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDirectorate (Ordnance), which will combine the functions of thetwo former directorates.    The reorganisation, which should resultin a more efficient and economical service, is expected to takeabout two years to complete, and consultations on its detailedimplementation will continue with the Staff and Trades Union Sides.)MOVEMENTS526. In March 1978 RFA logistic landing ships commenced ascheduled service every four to five days between MarchwoodMilitary Port and Antwerp.   By January 1980 the service will becapable of moving 200 containers monthly to and from BritishForces Germany and is already being used for moving some rationsupplies.    Following the withdrawal from service of the RFAtank-landing-ship Empire Gull, a logistic landing-ship hascommenced a regular monthly scheduled service for the movement ofammunition between Marchwood and continental Europe.527. In June 1978 detailed planning on the development ofMarchwood Military Port began.    This will lead to an increase inthe port&apos;s efficiency and involves the provision of a new jetty,capable of handling container traffic, a new customs house andthe realignment of railway and other facilities.528. The task of moving Services1 unaccompanied baggage isbeing transferred during 1979 from RNSD Deptford to the GovernmentFreight Agent (GFA Ltd).    This should provide an improved serviceat reduced cost.529. In accordance with the decisions reached in 1975, the task12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALf moving Gurkha personnel and their dependants by air betweenrunei, Hong Kong and Nepal, previously undertaken by the RAFir Transport Force, has since September 1978 been carried outder contract by the Royal Nepalese Airline Corporation.LANDS30. Defence land holdings (leasehold and freehold) wereeduced by a further 1,400 acres in the year ended 30 September978, making a total reduction of 34,800 acres over the six yearsp to that date. The release of land for which there is no foresee-ble defence requirement will continue during 1979.31. Additional Service conservation groups, of which there areow 106, were formed during the year.    Co-operation with externalrganisations and societies has been well maintained.WORKS.32,,   The programme of expenditure on new construction, whichRecounts for about half the works budget, continues to bepminated by the need to provide facilities for operational use.considerable effort, however, is also being made to improvepcoramodation and training facilities.mfi&apos;   This year work will continue on facilities for theBrtro&amp;uction of Tornado and on improvements to both the Army*s andJie Royal Navy&apos;s Estate.

In BAOR the barrack modernisation programme will continueand improvements will be made to technical facilities.    In theUnited Kingdom the refurbishment of the Army&apos;s barrack accommoda-tion is gathering momentum and a start is being made onrebuilding training camps.LIVING ACCOMMODATION535. The programme to improve the standard of thermal insulationin all married quarters required in the long term has beenaccelerated and the aim now is to complete the work by the endof March 1980.    This measure should go some way towards reducingheating bills while adding to the comfort of the families livingin quarters.    Other improvements, such as carpeting in all roomsin ratings&apos;, soldiers&apos; and airmens&apos; married quarters, are in handand modernisation of single living accommodation is alsoproceeding as quickly as practicable.536. The number of vacant married quarters remains high althoughnot all are permanently surplus to requirements. Neverthelessdetermined efforts are being made to match holdings more closelyto the likely future demand for married accommodation.    In the14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALear ended 31 October 1978 some 3*200 surplus quarters werelassed to the Property Services Agency for disposal, 1,600 morean in the previous year, and a further increase in the numbersSeleased for disposal is expected next year.    In addition morefers of short-term leases of temporarily surplus quartersave been taken up by local housing authorities.37.   The hire of married quarters for all three Serviceseluding civilian support personnel will cost about  45 million1979/80.   Most of the expenditure is incurred in the Federaljepublic of Germany.ENERGY CONSERVATION.3   tte Mm of Defence continues to exercise strictBmtrol over its use of energy and progress was made with energy-Rving schemes in several areas during 1978/79.    Among the savingsachi ;ad by the Royal Navy and the RNSTS have been reductions in fuelBnsumption in two store depots of 33% and 23% respectively,B^ugirt about by measures such as insulation of boilers, intro-Bction of thermostatically-controlled heaters, optimum startBntrols and false ceilings.    Fuel savings achieved by the Army0Ver &quot;he year include a combined saving of 220,000 litres ofittns^e fuel oil made by two units in BAOR following completionof &quot;tho introduction of optimum start controls for heatingjstems.   Recent measures undertaken by the Royal Air Force15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALinclude the installation of automatic flue dampers and heatingcontrols at various RAF stations; a scheme at RAF Carlisle isexpected to produce savings of 6% of fuel consumption. Significantefforts were made by Procurement Executive establishments to economi;on their use of energy over the last year and the savingsachieved include a 10% reduction in liquid fuel consumption atboth the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough and theRoyal Armament Research and Development Establishment, FortHalstead.   Various energy saving improvements are being putinto effect within the ROF organisation; one example is thelining of roofs of large production buildings in one factorywhich is expected to result in a 20% fuel saving.METEOROLOGY539.   The new Mk 3 upper air sounding system, the most technicallyadvanced in the world, has been installed and is operational atall the routine upper air observing stations in the UnitedKingdom.   Developments are in hand to enable its use at somenon-routine stations where special requirements exist.5-40.   A moderate improvement to the main computer installation(COSMOS) has been effected to meet the growth in demand forforecasting and climatological services, many of whichproduce an appreciable revenue. Approval has alsobeen given for the purchase of a very fast scientific computer16CONFIDENTIAL
cCONFIDENTIALto be added to the existing COSMOS system.    This will be usedfor research in modelling world climate and its variability,the development and introduction of new monthly forecastingtechniques, and the development of a model suitable fordetailed short period predictions.541. Automatic observing stations have been installed at anumber of sites and plans are in hand for a substantial increase\n their numbers over the next few years to enhance the observingnetwork.   Preparations are also well advanced for the intro-duction of some measure of automation at key major outstations,eginning with the meteorological office at Heathrow Airportduring 1979.542, Research activity designed to support all the servicesrovided by the Meteorological Office has continued, coveringlarge number of subjects.    Increasing attention is being giveno the study of long-term climate and the natural or man-madeactors which may affect it.OTHER SUPPORT^3.   The number of Ministry of Defence civilians for whomrevision has been made in the Defence Estimates atApril 1979 and 31 March 1980 is     263,300 &quot;.. In addition,ome     23,500       are employed in the Royal Ordnance Factories;heir costs are met from a Trading Fund.17-CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL544. The 1 April 1979 provision in Defence Estimates reflectsthe achievement of the civilian staff reductions required bythe 1974 Defence Review, and the subsequent Expenditure Reviewsof 1975 and 1976.    The commitment to make savings of 40,000 inthe number of MOD civilians including Headquarters Staffs, andin those employed by the Property Services Agency on defenceaccount, has been fulfilled.    On a broadly comparable basis,this brings the total reductions in MOD civilian numbers inthe 15-year period from 1 April 1964 to 1 April 1979 to some149,000.      The recommendations of the Management Review havealready contributed towards finding Headquarter savings andefforts to find further HQ reductions, both Service and civilian,are continuing     although the scope for this is necessarilydecreasing and may be affected by factors such as dispersal .Apprentices545. In view of the national shortage of skilled labour, it isintended to maintain in the coming year the increased level ofthe apprentice entry introduced last year.   A total of 2,250were entered in 1978 and there are now some 8,000 men and womenunder training, including over 1,000 in the ROFs.Dispersal546. Planning is going ahead to meet the Ministry&apos;s commitmentunder the Government&apos;s dispersal programme.   At the St Mellonssite in Cardiff, work has begun on a building for18CONFIDENTIAL

By the same date the firstase of the Glasgow programme should have been completed,-olving the transfer of 1,500 posts to the Anderston building;e second phase, which will involve the move of up to 4,000sts to the St Enoch site, is expected to take place in 1985/861987/88.19CONFIDENTIAL
