SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 2620 March 1979TEACHERS&quot; PAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Prices andConsumer Protection1. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committeeon Pay Negotiations (EY(P)), under my chairmanship, considered last weeka paper about teachers1 pay.    The outstanding problem concerns staging.The issue is so closely related to that of Civil Service pay that I hope thetwo questions can be discussed by the Cabinet at the same time.BACKGROUND2. The last general review of teachers pay was carried out by theHoughton Committee in 1974.    It established a series of relativities withother jobs, and gave the teachers a substantial pay increase.    Since thenit has been the objective of the teachers&apos; unions to restore their 1974position.    They reluctantly accepted an offer within the pay guidelines in1978.    But the employers and unions, out-voting the Governmentrepresentatives, established a Working Party to determine what payincreases would be needed in 1979 to restore the Houghton levels. Theirdraft reports indicate that teachers had fallen back by between 16 and20 per cent on 1 April 1978, and making allowance for movements in theearnings index since then, the teachers are claiming to be entitled to over30 per cent.3. Teachers have a unique right to go to arbitration, and the resultsof that arbitration can only be overthrown by a vote of both Houses ofParliament.    Moreover, arbitration could cover staging as well as quantum,and the Government would have no right to interfere with the arbitrationaward.4. There are full meetings of the negotiating machinery in Scotlandon Monday, and in England on Wednesday this week.5. EY(P) has agreed:-a.    that the management side should if necessary offer7 per cent from 1 April 1979, with discretion to go up to8 per cent but no higher;1COPY NOCABINETSECRET
SECRETb. that the management side should be told that theGovernment will only finance their normal Rate Support Grant(R!SG) share up to 8 per cent, and that there can be nocommitment at this stage to finance any part of the cost ofstaging arrangements relating to the &quot;comparability&quot;increases;c. that the comparability study (already agreed) shouldcover school teachers and further education teachers inGreat Britain and that other groups covered by the HoughtonReport   (eg, the Scottish Central Institutions) might be added;d. the terms of reference for the comparability study shouldnot mention the Houghton Report (ie it should not be taken asan automatic base line for the comparability study); theSecretary of State for Education and Science and PaymasterGeneral is proposing a pomible formula to deal with this problem.6. EY(P) decided to refer the question of staging to Cabinet for adecision. Decisions on staging in the public sector have so far fallen intotwo main groups:-i.     Those covered by the reports of the review bodies last year,whose findings are being implemented in two  equal stages on1 April 1979 and 1 April 1980 following a 10 per cent Stage Threepayment in 1978,    The settlements for the police and fire servicessimilarly provided for their big pay increase to be phased in bytwo annual instalments following a 10 per cent Stage Threesettlement.ii.     The public service groups covered by the recent DowningStreet agreement, who are being offered the results ofcomparability studies phased in on 1 August 1979 andl^NiTirr mini r 1980.    Nurses will be treated in the same way;so may some other smaller local authority groups.In the private sector, the plumbers and the heating and ventilatingindustry have received &quot;special case&apos; treatment (under paragraphs 15 and16 of the White Paper) which allowed them to catch up with their outsideanalogues by two stages spread over a year.8. Colleagues will be aware from my separate paper (CP(79) 25) ofthe staging pattern proposed for the Civil Service.    If we concede thatthe PRU recommendations will be implemented in full by 1 April 1980 itwill be very difficult to justify less generous treatment for teachers.27.SECRET
SECRET9. The Secretary ef State for Education, and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, are prepared to stage in the teachers settlement over21 months, with the first instalment in January 1980 and the remainderin January 1981.    This involves the risk that the staging pattern would beoverthrown by arbitration if the teachers unions decided on that course.10. The chances of a successful challenge will clearly be affected bythe line which the Government takes over staging of Civil Service pay.Accordingly, I seek the Cabinet&apos;s views on whether to make an offer to theteachers unions based on a 21 month staging pattern, or on some shorterperiod.R HDepartment of Prices and Consumer Protection20 March 19793SECRET
