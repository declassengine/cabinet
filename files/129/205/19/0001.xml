CONFIDENTIALOCUMENT IS THE PRO PERTH OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 1913 March 1979COPY NO80CABINETUPRATING OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS .Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services andthe Minister for Social Security1. The social security uprating, by which pensions and other long-termbenefits are raised in line with earnings (or prices if they rise faster) and themain short-term benefits in line with prices, will have to take place no laterthan the week commencing 12 November.    Decisions on the new rates areneeded this month so that an announcement can be made in the Budget speech.Firm forecasts of &quot;he likely movement of earnings and prices are not yetavailable, but the Treasury have provided a provisional assumption of rises of12 per cent for both over the 12-month period to November 1979.SHORTFALL2. The 1978 uprating fell short of the actual movement in earnings andprices over the 12 months up to last November by 1.9 per cent and 1 per centrespectively.    Although there is no statutory requirement to make good thisshortfall, the Government will come under severe criticism - the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) and pensioner organisations are watching this issueclosely - if it does not take corrective action.    The present single personrates of  19. 50 for long-term benefits and  15. 75 for short-term benefitsshould have been  19. 85 and  15. 90 respectively last November, at anadditional cost of  190 million in a full year.    We do not propose thatPensioners and other beneficiaries should be compensated retrospectively forthis loss but we believe that it is essential, if the forecasting method is not tofallinto disrepute, that the Government uses the corrected figures as the basisfor the 1979 uprating, ie  19. 90 uprated by 12 per cent producing revised ratesof  22. 20 for long-term benefits ( 35. 50 for a married couple) and  17. 80 forshort-term ( 28. 80 for a married couple).MARGINThe widening gap between the long and short-term rates is becomingerY difficulty to justify - it is now  5. 70 for married couples under theNatiorial Insurance (NI) scheme and  6. 30 under the supplementary benefit1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALscheme,    We therefore propose a 1 per cent margin over the price forecastfor those receiving the short-term rates, making a rate of  18 at an additionalcost of  25 million.    In view of the scepticism aroused by last year&apos;s fore-cast, a margin which gives some protection to the poorest s^ems to us nomore than prudent.LCNG-TERM SCALE RATE4.       The widening gap also highlights the problem of the long-termunemployed, who are experiencing unjustifiable hardship because they areineligible for the long-term rate of supplementary benefit.    We think it rightto raise this issue now because if it is left to the 1979 Public ExpenditureSurvey no progress can be made until 1980.    There is increasing pressurefrom the TUC, backbenchers and the Supplementary Benefits Commission toend this injustice and we therefore propose to extend the long-term rate to allrecipients of supplementary allowance - including the unemployed - after oneyear on benefit.    This would coat  30 million in 1979-80 and  90 million in1980-81, and would require 20C extra staff in 1979-80 and 95 extra in subsequentyears.    To extend the long-term rate to the unemployed after two years onbenefit - that is, to treat them in the same way as other beneficiaries - wouldcost  15 million in 1979-80 and  35 million in 1980-81, and would require360 extra staff in 1979-80 and 180 extra in subsequent years.CHILD BENEFIT5.       Child benefit will be  4 per week per child from April 1979, when childtax allowances will finally end,    The majority of families will thus look for animprovement in child benefit to protect family support against inflation. Wehave made considerable progress since 1974 and it is important that we do notnow lose momentum.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, has recognised thisand has indicated that he would agree to an increase to  4. 50 in November 1979.In our view, the minimum which would be defensible would be  4. 60.6-       We believe that the extra lOp will make a great deal of difference toour supporters.    The long-term objective of the Party and the TUC is toraise child benefit to the point where the remaining small NI addition paid foreach child of a recipient of sickness benefit or unemployment benefit (which*iU be 85p a week from April 1979) will be overtaken by child benefit. Thiswould ensure that the money paid for a child is the same whether the parent isin or out of work.    It would be a great help on the incentive front and wouldaave 350 staff.    To achieve this objective straightaway would cost *95 million in 1979-80 and  725 million in 1980-81, and clearly we cannotaflord that.7&apos;       But if we cannot achieve our objective straightaway, we should at leastmake progress towards it.    Using the 12 per cent assumption, a  4. 50 childbe*efit rate implies an increase in the NI addition to 95p, and therefore a stepback from our objective.    A  4. 60 rate would hold the NI dependency addition2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALat 85p and would prevent the long-term objective slipping away. It would cost 120 million in 1979-80 and  300 million in 1980-81. We believe that the extra10p would be crucial in determining the attitude of our supporters.8. We also propose that the one-parent ii mily premium should beincreased from  2 to  2. 50 at a cost of  2 million in 1979-80 and  6 millionin 1980-81.DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS9. Approximately 38 per cent of all households will gain from the aboveproposals.    Some 18 per cent of the cost of the child benefit uprating will bereceived by households in the lowest 20 per cent of the income distributionwhile only 10 per cent will be received by the top 20 per cent of households.As a proportion of net income the changes in child benefit are progressivelydistributed.    Even co, many households in the lowest 20 per cent will not beaffected by the changes (about three-quarters), partly because they do notcontain children and partly because they are receiving NI child dependencybenefits.CONCLUSIONS10. The proposals made in this papar and their costs are summarised inthe Annex.    The Cabinet are asked:a. To endorse the proposal for an uprating of NI and linked benefitsin November 1979 based on the correction of last year&apos;s shortfall.b. To approve an addition of a 1 per cent margin for short-termcases.c. To agree to the extension of the long-term supplementary benefitscale rate to all recipients after one year.d. To agree to an increase in child benefit to  4.60 in November1979.e. To approve an uprating of the one-parent family premium from 2 to  2. 50.D ES ODePartment of Health and Social Security12 March 19793CONFIDENTIAL
