4Section I: Introduction1. In accordance with the recommendation of the Select Committee onEuropean Community Secondary Legislation (second report, 1972-73 Session),this White Paper aims to give a factual account of events and developments inthe European Community during the period 1 July to 31 December 1978, theperiod of the German Presidency.2. During the six months covered by this report, Community activity wasdominated by work on establishing a European Monetary System (EMS), whichhad been launched at the meeting of the European Council in Bremen on6-7 July. In the event, agreement was reached on an exchange rate mechanismfor the EMS, but not one which met the United Kingdom criteria for a durablesystem. Other features of the EMS, such as the formation of a new EuropeanCurrency Unit (ECU), preparation for an eventual European Monetary Fund,and the expansion of the credit facilities of the Community, were agreed inprinciple by all nine Member States at the European Council meeting on4-5 December. It did not, however, prove possible for the EMS to be set inoperation from 1 January 1979 because the French made agreement to thedetailed texts conditional upon arrangements being adopted for the automaticelimination of any new monetary compensatory amounts arising after theintroduction of the EMS.3. The European Council in Bremen on 6-7 July agreed that &quot;concurrentstudies&quot; should also be undertaken on ways of strengthening the economies ofthe less prosperous Member States of the Community. The United Kingdomattaches importance to this exercise, in view of the need to put right the perversesituation whereby the United Kingdom had become the second largest netcontributor to the Community budget despite our relatively low gross domesticproduct (GDP) per head. This work was given further impetus at the EuropeanCouncil meeting in Brussels on 4-5 December, when the Commission wasrequested to study the relationship between economic convergence and the utilis-ation of Community instruments.4. Since the CAP continued to absorb 75 % of the Community budget, theUK was particularly concerned with the remit given by the European Councilto the Commission in July to consider the future development of the CommonAgricultural Policy (CAP), in particular its share of the Community budget andthe need to reduce surpluses. At the December European Council, the Commis-sion presented its ideas for tackling agricultural surpluses, including a pricefreeze for 1979-80. These will be further considered when the Commission^specific price proposals for 1979-1980 are examined in greater detail.5. Another key feature of the Community&apos;s activities in the second half of1978 was the continuing work on the eventual accession of Greece, Spain andPortugal to membership of the Community. The negotiations on the accessionof Greece reached an advanced state. The formal opening of negotiations withPortugal took place in October and a decision was taken at the DecemberCouncil on the opening of negotiations with Spain. The Council recognised theneed for early work on the effect of enlargement on the institutions of theCommunity, and commissioned a study by a three-man Committee which isdue to report in October 1979.1
6. There were welcome developments in the Community&apos;s work aimed atpromoting the employment of young people. Agreement was reached inDecember on the terms of job creation programmes for the under 25s whichwill be supported from the European Social Fund. In the industrial sector,the United Kingdom supported the agreement to renew until the end of 1979the anti-crisis measures taken to assist the steel industry in the face of depressedprices and sluggish demand for steel world-wide.7. Preparations for the first direct election to the European Assembly to beheld in June 1979 continued in all the Member States. The United Kingdomwelcomed the agreement reached by the European Council in December thatthe salaries of the directly-elected Assembly Members should be paid anddetermined by national authorities, the need for moderation in fixing ofAssembly Members&apos; salaries having been a prime United Kingdom objective.Section II:   Political Co-operation8. The Nine Member States co-ordinated their policies closely during the33rd United Nations General Assembly. They launched an initiative designedto strenghten UN measures for the maintenance of peace. In other spheres theydemonstrated their determination to fight racism and to uphold respect forhuman rights throughout the world.9. The Nine have followed developments in the Middle East closely. Intheir declarations of 6 July and of 23 October, Ministers expressed their concernat developments in the Lebanon, and reiterated their support for Lebanon&apos;sindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. On 19 September Ministerswelcomed the results of the Camp David Summit as a major step on the pathto a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace.10. Together or individually the Nine have been active in promotingpeaceful solutions to the problems and conflicts of the African continent.11. Close co-operation among the Nine has continued at the variousmeetings of experts held as part of the follow up to the Conference on Co-operation and Security in Europe (CSCE). Member States are engaged inpreparatory work for the next major CSCE meeting to be held in Madrid in1980.12. The Nine have continued to devote attention to the introduction of thethree applicant States into Political Co-operation. Since after the secondenlargement Turkey will be the only remaining country whose relations with theCommunity are based on an Association Agreement which could result insubsequent accession, the Nine have offered Turkey arrangements providingfor a mutual exchange of information.2Section III:   Enlargement, External Relations, Trade and AidEnlargement13. Negotiations on the terms for Greece&apos;s entry into the Communitycontinued. Meetings of the EEC/Greece Negotiating Conference were heldmonthly at Ambassadorial level and there were three Ministerial meetings. TheCouncil achieved its objective of breaking the back of the Greek negotiations,which are now likely to be concluded early in 1979. The formal opening ofnegotiations with Portugal took place in October and there was later one meetingat Ambassadorial level. In December, the Commission tabled its Opinion onSpain&apos;s application for membership. The Opinion was considered at theDecember meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, when it was decided formallyto open negotiations with Spain in February.General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): Multilateral Trade Negotiations14. In July the Community with the other major participants reachedagreement on a framework of understanding on the main elements necessary fora comprehensive agreement in the multilateral trade negotiations. This set outthe main areas for further negotiation, though the developing countries claimedthat it took too little account of their special interests. The Community played amajor role in the increasingly intensive negotiations in Geneva throughout theautumn, following the agreement at the Bonn Summit that the negotiatorsshould try to complete their work in December. Progress in the negotiationswas regularly discussed by the Council of Ministers, and there was a specialForeign Affairs Council on 12 December for this purpose. Although it was notpossible in the event to complete the negotiations by mid-December, substantialadvances had been made by then and the Community and other major partici-pants considered that significant progress had been made across the whole rangeof issues. There was substantial agreement amongst major parties in thenegotiations to reduce non-tariff barriers, a key element in the Tokyo Round,notably in the series of codes covering subsidies and countervailing duties,Government procurement, standards, customs valuation and licensing. Dis-cussions were continuing on the attempt to negotiate a code of conductgoverning safeguard action, including recognition of selective safeguards.Textiles15. Under the terms of the relevant bilateral agreements in the Multi-fibreArrangement, new quotas were introduced on certain products imported fromArgentina, Singapore, the Philippines and India. New bilateral restraint agree-ments were initialled with Bangladesh and Hungary.16. Quotas were also imposed on imports of certain products from Greece,Turkey, and Malta for the remainder of 1978. Voluntary restraint arrangementswere reached with Greece, Spain and Portugal in July. In November andDecember the Commission undertook negotiations with these and otherMediterranean suppliers to obtain agreements on the voluntary restraint of theirtextile exports to the EEC in 1979 and, where possible, beyond. These negoti-ations were reviewed by the Council of Ministers on 19 December when draft3
agreements with Greece, Spain and Morocco were approved. The Council alsoagreed on the basis for further negotiations by the Commission with the otherMediterranean countries concerned and on the procedure if agreements are notreached.Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)17. The Commission^ proposals for the Community&apos;s GSP for 1979 wereapproved by the Council of Ministers in December. They provide for improvedaccess to the Community for a number of industrial and agricultural productsand the inclusion of some new agricultural products. There are further improve-ments for the least developed group of countries. For textiles, the arrangementsfor the last six months of 1978 are to be continued for the first six months of 1979with a 5 per cent increase in tariff quotas and ceilings pending discussion of anew textile regime.Japan18. The Community pursued its efforts to develop a closer relationship withJapan and to resolve the problems caused in this relationship by continuingJapanese trade and payments surpluses. Following high level consultations at thebeginning of December, the Council agreed that the Japanese Governmentshould be invited to take further steps to stimulate imports.Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)19. The first ever EEC/ASEAN Ministerial meeting was held in Brusselson 20-21 November. It was agreed that exploratory talks about the possiblecontent of a co-operation agreement between the EEC and ASEAN shouldtake place shortly thereafter.Yugoslavia20. The Commission introduced revised proposals for negotiating directivesfor a new EEC/Yugoslavia agreement. These were discussed at meetings of theForeign Affairs Council in October, November and December and it was agreedto reach a decision on them as soon as possible in 1979.Relations between The Community and the Council for Mutual EconomicAssistance (CMEA)21. Further negotiations with the CMEA about an agreement between thetwo organisations took place in July and November. The Community put newproposals to the CMEA at the November meeting and they are now beingconsidered. A number of difficulties remain to be solved, but the Communityintends to pursue the negotiations with the aim of establishing a better workingrelationship with both the CMEA and its Member States.European Free Trade Area (EFTA)22. In December, the Council of Ministers approved a paper which set outspecific proposals for extended co-operation both within and outside the scopeof the EEC/EFTA Free Trade Agreements.4Lome Convention23. The ACP/EEC Consultative Assembly, and its subordinate body theACP/EEC Joint Committee, held meetings in Luxembourg from 25 to 29September 1978. Discussion centred on a report on the working of the presentconvention and on matters relating to the negotiations for a successor con-vention.24. The formal opening of the re-negotiation took place in Brussels on 24.July. The negotiations proper began on 18 September, and are expected tolast until the spring of 1979. An EEC/ACP Ministerial Conference devotedsolely to the question of the new Convention took place on 21 December. Thisprovided further guidelines to the negotiators for use in the early months of1979. Agreement was reached at the Conference on the need for further jointEEC/ACP examination of human rights in the context of the re-negotiation.Mediterranean25. Agreements with Malta, Cyprus, Israel and the countries of the Maghreband Mashraq entered into effect on 1 November, and the first Co-operationCouncils with Tunisia and Israel took place on 12 and 22 December respectivelyThe Financial Protocols to the Community&apos;s current agreements with Malta,Cyprus and the countries of the Maghreb and Mashraq entered into effect on1 November.Euro-Arab Dialogue26. The General Committee meeting in Damascus in December was longoverdue; its successful conclusion will permit the Dialogue to continue in a lowkey. The&apos; Arabs raised two main political demands: the recognition of thePalestine Liberation Organization and a Euro-Arab meeting at Ministerial level.Ten new jointly financed Euro-Arab projects were added to the nine approvedby the last General Committee in Brussels; these were mainly feasibility studiesto establish technical and educational centres, or to undertake practical projectswith a regional flavour (so far in the fields of agriculture, transport and industry)or to organise cultural events.Latin America27. The second session of the ninth meeting between EEC Ambassadorsand Latin American Ambassadors under the Community&apos;s dialogue with LatinAmerica took place in Brussels on 11 December. The Latin American delegationreported on the recent meeting in Uruguay of the members of the LatinAmerican Economic System (SELA). There was also some general discussionon trade relations between the Community and Latin American countries,but the expected report of the Joint Working Party of Experts on Trade Questionhad not been completed in time for the meeting.North/South Dialogue28. The Community has continued to co-ordinate its position on North/South matters, including the Common Fund. The Community made a sub-stantial contribution to the elaboration of a draft resolution on the New Inter-
national Development Strategy, which was adopted by consensus at the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations in New York in December.Financial and Technical Aid to Non-Associated Developing Countries29. The agreed position reached by Ministers at the April DevelopmentCouncil on an enabling regulation to establish a continuing programme of aid tonon-associates was the subject of conciliation with the Assembly who did notagree with certain administrative provisions. Pending the outcome of thisconciliation, Ministers agreed an ad hoc programme for 1978 and guidelines for1979 at the 10 October Development Council. As in 1977, about three-quartersof the 1978 money (70 million European Units of Account (EUA) in total) wasallocated to Asia and most of the rest to Latin America, though for the first timea small sum was devoted to Africa (Mozambique and Angola). The ad hocguidelines agreed for 1979 were similar to previous years but there was no finaldecision on the allocations between different geographical regions or the sum tobe set aside for emergencies. After discussion in the Budget Council and theAssembly, it was agreed that a sum of 110 million EUA for new commitmentappropriations should be included in the 1979 Community Budget, an increaseof 40 million EUA over 1978.International Grains Conference30. Negotiations in UNCTAD for the conclusion of a new InternationalWheat/Grains Agreement including a Wheat Trade Convention (also providingfor food security stocks) and a new Food Aid Convention continued.Food Aid31. Discussion of the Commission proposals for the reorganisation ofCommunity food aid management, essentially foreseeing a Council WorkingGroup for food aid policy questions and a Management Committee to assist theCommission in the day to day running of the programmes, came to no con-clusion. Revised proposals are being considered.32. The Council of Ministers agreed an allocation of 31,000 tonnes of driedskimmed milk and 12,700 tonnes of butteroil this year to help develop the dairyindustry in India under Operation Dairy Flood II, within total programmes of150,000 and 45,000 tonnes respectively.33. The 1979 food aid programmes were not agreed by the end of 1978, butthe Commission announced that under a new Food Aid Convention they wouldagree to increase their obligation from 1,287,000 tonnes of cereals to 1,650,000tonnes a year.Section IV:   Agriculture and FisheriesThe Common Agricultural Policy34. 6-7 July the European Council invited the Commission to consider thefuture development of the CAP; the Council indicated that the aim should be toreduce surpluses which, in turn, should lead to a better balance of expenditurewithin the Community budget. The Commission presented their report to the6December meeting of the European Council and invited the Council to endorsethe guidelines for future policy which were suggested therein. These guidelinesincluded a general price freeze for the 1979/80 marketing year, a rigorous,price policy for as long as major market imbalances persist, measures to reducemarket imbalance in the milk sector (mitigated by selective income subsidies tosmall farmers with no alternatives to milk), and a strengthening of structuralpolicy. The report also urged that all existing monetary compensatory amountsshould be systematically dismantled once the European Monetary System hadbeen fully established, and recommended that the Community should workthrough new consultative arrangements in the multilateral trade negotiations soas to achieve long term stability for international trade in agricultural com-modities. The Commission said it would base its price proposals for 1979/80on the report&apos;s guidelines. The European Council agreed to return to the reportat its meeting in March 1979.Monetary Arrangements35. The European Council on 4-5 December, concluded that the intro-duction of the new European Monetary System should not, itself, result in anychange in the situation obtaining at the time of changeover regarding theexpression in national currencies of agricultural prices, monetary compensatoryamounts and all other amounts fixed for the purposes of the CAP. A Corn-mission proposal providing for the adoption of the European Currency Unitin the CAP, in a way which would have been in accordance with the EuropeanCounciTs decision, was considered by the Agriculture Council on 18-19December but no agreement was reached.Processed Foods: Monetary Compensatory Amounts36. In September the Commission made a 10 per cent cut in monetarycompensatory amounts for certain processed foods. This reduced the chargeon exports of foods such as biscuits and confectionery.Milk and Milk Products37. On 30-31 October, the Council adopted a regulation authorising thepayment in the United Kingdom of a Community-financed subsidy equivalentto about 6p per pound, on 51,025 tonnes of Community (including home-produced) butter. It also agreed that the import levy on 17,000 tonnes of NewZealand butter imported into the United Kingdom should be reduced by asimilar amount. These measures formed part of the further steps, agreed bythe Council during the prices settlement in May, to encourage butter con-sumption in the EEC, in addition to the existing Community-financed buttersubsidy for the United Kingdom.Beef38. The Council agreed, at its December meeting, to extend until the expiryof the Lome Convention in March 1980, the arrangements which allow theimport of beef from ACP countries at reduced rates of import levy.7
Pigmeat39. In December, the Commission proposed modifications to the co-efficients used to calculate the monetary compensatory amounts applied totrade in pigmeat products including bacon and ham. The reductions proposedwere in the range of 6 per cent to 10 per cent. The proposals are still underconsideration by the Member States.Mutton and Lamb40. The Commission^ proposals for a common market organisation con-tinued to be examined at technical level.Olive Oil41. The Council adopted changes in the market organisation to encouragethe consumption of olive oil within the Community by means of a new aid toreduce the market price relative to competing vegetable oils. In addition, toavoid increasing problems of surpluses, production aid is to be limited to olive oilfrom existing areas of production. The measures, due to be implemented on1 November, will now come into force on 1 January 1979.Mediterranean Agriculture42. The Council finalised agreement on four outstanding items in thepackage of measures for improving the structure of agriculture in the poorerMediterranean areas of the Community. These items concerned an agriculturaladvisory service for Italy, afforestation to prevent erosion in dry areas and twominor projects for flood prevention and irrigation in the south of France andCorsica.Other Structural Measures43. The review of the Community&apos;s Socio-Structural Directives continued.In this context the Council in December agreed in principle to a proposal thatEuropean Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund assistance should begiven to joint UK/Irish Republic measures to improve the arterial drainageof land lying on both sides of the border between Northern Ireland and the IrishRepublic. It is proposed that half the cost up to a maximum eligible expenditureof 15.1 million ua over 5 years will be met from the fund.Food Labelling44. The Council adopted, in December, a directive on the labelling, presen-tation and advertising of food for sale to the ultimate consumer. Member stateshave until December 1982 to implement the provisions which include the opendate marking of most pre-packaged foods.The Veterinary Profession45. The Council approved, on 18 December, the texts of two directivesconcerning the right of establishment and freedom to provide services ofveterinary surgeons who are nationals of member states. These two directiveshave to be implemented by member states within two years of their notification.The Council also adopted a decision to set up an Advisory Committee onVeterinary Training.8Animal Health46. In December the Standing Veterinary Committee of the Commissionagreed to the extension, for a further year, of the derogation granted at the endof 1977 which enables national control measures to be applied to prevent theimportation of animals infected with enzootic bovine leukosis from other EECcountries.Pesticides47. In December, the Council adopted a directive prohibiting the marketingand use of pesticide products containing a number of active ingredients in themercurial and organo-chlorine groups. Where satisfactory alternatives are notavailable, however, the directive provides that particular products can continueto be used for defined purposes for the time being. Member states have until1 January 1981 to implement the directive.FisheriesInternal Regime48. There was little progress in negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policyover the summer, although agreement was reached in July on short-term interimaid measures for the inshore sector and aquaculture, and on aid for Irish andDanish enforcement costs. Amendments to the Commission^ conservationproposals were tabled in September and November; the United KingdomGovernment maintained in force existing national conservation measures and,in view of the need to protect certain other fish stocks in waters under UnitedKingdom sovereignty or jurisdiction, introduced further national conservationmeasures.49. A special Fisheries Council was arranged in November. The UnitedKingdom put on the table clear proposals on the fundamental problem of accesspreference, but it did not prove possible to resolve this issue. Following theEuropean Council in December, there was general agreement that effortsshould be continued towards finding an acceptable solution. Pending a definitivesolution, interim measures concerning the conduct of fishing and the applicationof national conservation measures in the first three months of 1979 were agreedat the Council on 19 December.External Regime50. The Council, at its meeting on 24 July, formally approved the 1978reciprocal fishing agreements with Norway, Sweden and the Faroe Islandswhich the Commission had negotiated earlier in the year. Decisions were alsoreached on the division among Member States of 1978 Community quotas inNorthern Norwegian and Faroese waters. In November licensing arrangementswere introduced for Swedish and Faroese fishing in Member States&apos; waters.Spanish fishermen continued to fish under licence.51. Agreement was reached with Norway on reciprocal fishing arrangementsfor 1979; consultations with Sweden and the Faroes did not reach a conclusionbefore the end of the year. The Council agreed interim arrangements to allowreciprocal fishing to continue into 1979.9
52. The Community as a body acceded to the North West Atlantic FisheriesOrganisation (NAFO), which came into force on 1 January 1979 and willhenceforth regulate fisheries in the North West Atlantic outside the 200 milefishery zones of coastal states.Statistical Information53. Tables showing the cost of United Kingdom imports of food, feed andalcoholic beverages, together with export values, are given at Annex III.Section V:   Economic, Monetary and Budgetary QuestionsEconomic and Monetary Co-operationThe European Monetary System54. The main tasks of both the Finance Council and the Monetary Com-mittee concerned development work on the European Monetary System (EMS).The work was launched at the meeting of European Heads of Governmentheld in Bremen on 6 and 7 July, which considered an outline scheme put forwardby the French and the Germans. The EMS was discussed at all subsequentmeetings of the Finance Council, and the United Kingdom took an activerole in the discussions. In particular, it was the United Kingdom&apos;s objectivethat the system should be constructed in such a way as to ensure that it couldaccommodate all members of the Community, despite the current differencesin their economic performance. The United Kingdom made a number ofspecific suggestions about the operation of the exchange rate mechanism of theEMS, and pressed for a satisfactory conclusion to the concurrent studies ofways of helping the less prosperous members of the Community.55. At the end of the day, however, no agreement could be reached on anexchange rate mechanism that met the United Kingdom&apos;s criteria for a success-ful and durable system. The Prime Minister therefore told his colleagues atthe further meeting of the European Council held in Brussels on 4 and 5 Decem-ber, that he would not be recommending the British Government to join theexchange rate arrangements of the EMS. The detailed arrangements of theEMS are described in the Resolution of the European Council published inCmnd 7419. Agreement was reached on the formation of a new monetaryunit in the Community   the European Currency Unit (ECU) (which wouldhave the same value as the European Unit of Account at the outset of thesystem), and it was agreed that the existing credit mechanisms in the Community,and the existing European Monetary Co-operation Fund, should be con-solidated within two years into a European Monetary Fund. The UnitedKingdom will be taking part in these other aspects of the EMS. Agreementwas also reached that in the interim period before the European MonetaryFund is set up, the credit facilities of the Community should be expanded to25 billion ECUs.1056. In order to give effect to the agreement reached at the European Council,the Finance Council met on 18 December to consider two Regulations providingthe framework in Community law for the EMS, and a Council Decision toincrease the size of the medium-term financial assistance facility. BothRegulations and the Decision were agreed in principle but subject to Frenchwaiting reserves. Subsequently the French indicated that they were not preparedto lift their reserves until a satisfactory settlement of the dispute about theelimination of new Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) had beenachieved. As these Regulations (but not the Decision on the medium termfacility) are necessary before the EMS can start to operate, the consequences ofthe French decision was to postpone the start of the EMS beyond the agreeddate of 1 January 1979.57. In the context of the European Monetary System, Finance Ministers attheir July meeting invited the Economic Policy Committee to undertake a studyof action required to strengthen the economies of less prosperous Member Statesin accordance with the agreed conclusions of the European Council meeting atBremen on 6 and 7 July. The Economic Policy Committee delivered two interimreports to the September and October Councils and its final report was submittedto Finance Ministers in November. This issue was then discussed at the EuropeanCouncil meeting in Brussels on 4 and 5 December. Throughout these discussionsthe UK delegation stressed the need to ensure that the resource transfersresulting from the Community&apos;s policies are in conformity with the Community&apos;sobjective of bringing about convergence in the economic performance of itsmembers. At its December meeting, the European Council also asked theCommission to undertake a study of the relationship between economic con-vergence and the utilisation of Community instruments, particularly those aimedat reducing structural imbalances, and to report its findings in readiness for thenext European Council to be held in March 1979.Other Finance Council Business58. The proposal for a new Community loan instrument of 1,000 millionEuropean Units of Account was adopted as a Council Decision at the Octobermeeting of the Finance Council after conciliation with the European Parliament.The Co-operation Agreement between the Commission and the EuropeanInvestment Bank was signed in November and the facility will become operationalwhen the Council has adopted detailed rules of eligibility for the facility.59. In its Second Quarterly Review of the economic situation in the Com-munity, the Council, meeting in July, approved a Decision on the adjustment ofpublic budgets for 1978 and the preparation of public budgets for 1979 withinthe framework of a co-ordinated Community approach. At their Decembermeeting Finance Ministers approved the Annual Report on the economicsituation in the Community and guidelines for Member States in 1979. TheDecember Council also approved proposals from the Chairman of the Co-ordinating Group to expand the work of the Group on economic convergence.60. The July meeting of the Finance Council adopted a common position onthe Regulation implementing the European Unit of Account as the main unit ofaccount to be used for Community business. The Regulation has not yet beenfinally adopted, however, but a separate Regulation applying the European Unitof Account to the Customs area was adopted in November.11
61. Meeting in October, Finance Ministers held a preliminary exchange ofviews on preparations for the Tripartite Conference with the Social Partnerswhich was held in Brussels on 9 November; a report on the Conference by itsChairman, Count Lambsdorff, was subsequently delivered to Finance Ministersat their meeting in November. Finance Ministers also reached agreement at theirSeptember meeting on the statement which was to be made by the Presidency atthe annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund.Budgetary QuestionsThe 1979 Community Budget62. The preliminary draft budget amounted to 13,859 million EuropeanUnits of Account (EUA) (about  8,730 million) for payment appropriationsand 14,667 million EUA ( 9,239 million) for commitment appropriations. Theformer represented an increase of 1,497 million EUA ( 943 million) on the 1978Budget. It was debated by the House of Commons on 10 July.63. The draft budget was established by the Council of Ministers on 18 July.The Council reduced the provision in the preliminary draft budget by 838million EUA ( 528 million) to 13,021 million EUA ( 8,202 million) for paymentappropriations and by 870 million EUA ( 548 million) to 13,797 million EUA( 8,691 million) for commitment appropriations. The Draft Budget togetherwith revised appropriations mainly for the Common Agricultural Policy whichwere incorporated in a letter of amendment which revised the total to 13,175million EUA ( 8,299 million) for payment appropriations and 13,948 millionEUA ( 8,786 million) for commitment appropriations, was then sent to theEuropean Assembly for their consideration. On 25 October the Assemblyadopted amendments and modifications to the Draft Budget totalling 878 millionEUA ( 553 million) for payments and 2,303 million EUA ( 1,451 million) forcommitments. The Council considered these amendments and modifications on20 November and returned the Budget to the Assembly in a form which includedincreases totalling 322 million EUA ( 203 million), in payments and 629 millionEUA ( 396 million) in commitment appropriations. These included increasestotalling 480 million EUA ( 302 million) for commitment appropriations and233 million EUA ( 147 million) for payment appropriations on the RegionalDevelopment Fund.64. The proposed increase in the figure for commitments on the RegionalDevelopment Fund could not be made without breaching the maximum rateof increase applicable to non-obligatory expenditure. (The maximum rate ofincrease would give the Assembly a margin of 133 million EUA for commit-ments). But the Council did not agree to any increase in this maximum rate; itmade clear to the Assembly that it would take a decision on this at a later date.65. The European Council at its meeting on 5 December maintained theposition it had adopted a year previously on provision for the Regional Develop-ment Fund, including commitments of 620 million EUA in 1979. The BudgetCouncil, reflecting the decision of the European Council, held further meetingson 5 and 12 December on the question of the maximum rate, and decided toseek agreement with the Assembly on a new maximum rate which would notgreatly exceed 133 million EUA. However on 14 December the President of theEuropean Assembly declared the Budget finally adopted on the ground that the12Assembly had made no amendments to the Draft Budget as agreed by the20 November Council. But no agreement with the Council on a new maximumrate had been reached at any stage.66. On 19 December the Budget Council informed the Assembly that theCouncil had concluded that the purported adoption of the Budget did notcomply with the provisions of the Treaty. The Council made clear that if theAssembly wished the dialogue between the Council and the Assembly could becontinued.67. Negotiations continued in an effort to resolve the problem of the 1979Budget; it will be the subject for further Council discussion.Financing the Budget68. Although the Ninth Directive on VAT required all Member States toimplement the Sixth Directive by 1 January 1979, only five Member Stateswere able to do so and will therefore pay VAT on resources. The remainingMember States (Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg and Germany) were expected tomake payments on a GNP-related basis.68. The Treasury&apos;s latest estimates(l) on the basis of current Communitypolicies, for UK contributions to, and public sector receipts from, the Com-munity Budget, in calendar years, together with figures for past years, are asfollows: 	  million			Gross		Net	Contribution		Contribution1973	181	79	1021974	181	150	311975	342	398	- 561976	463	296	167f1977	737	368	3691978	1,285	555	7301979*	1,430	650	7801980*	1,655	760	895* Forecasts for 1979 and 1980 are at 1978 prices. Inflation will increase these figures.t Up to mid-1976, the monetary compensatory amounts which are payable on agriculturalimports into the UK from other Member States and are financed wholly by the EEC werepaid by the UK and included in the receipts shown above. From that date they have beenpaid by the exporting Member State and are therefore excluded from the UK&apos;s receipts.This change increased the UK&apos;s net contribution to the Budget but correspondinglyreduced the cost of the imports concerned.United Kingdom Contributions to the Community Budget70. During the latter half of 1978, agreement was reached on the method offinancing residual gap which was left unresolved at the European Council&apos;sdiscussions on Article 131 in December 1977 on the implementation of Article131 of Treaty of Accession.(1) Government Green Paper &quot;The European Monetary System&quot; Command 7405, November1978.13
Customs Union71. On 18-19 December, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted a package ofproposals concerned with travellers&apos; allowances and tax and duty free importa-tion of small non-commercial consignments. For the most part these proposalswere concerned with the change over from the gold parity Unit of Account (UA)to the European Unit of Account (EUA). However, the United Kingdomsuccessfully pressed for agreement to an increase in the minimum age limit forallowances of tobacco, cigarettes etc, wines and spirits from 15 to 17 years. Inaddition, the allowance for &apos;other&apos; goods ie those not subject to quantitativerestrictions was increased from 125 UA ( 50) to 180 EUA ( 120) for goods inthe personal baggage of travellers within the Community which have beenpurchased tax and duty paid on the domestic market of one of the Member Statesand from 25 UA ( 10) to 40 EUA ( 28) for goods in the personal baggage oftravellers coming from third countries. The allowance for wine purchased taxand duty paid within the Community was increased from three to four litres. Forsmall non-commercial consignments, the duty and tax-free allowance wasincreased from 40 UA ( 17) to 60 EUA ( 40) for those sent from other MemberStates and an allowance of 30 EUA ( 20) was agreed for those sent from thirdcountries. The package as a whole came into force on 1 January 1979.Taxation72. The Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 18-19 December adopted thesecond Directive on tobacco tax harmonisation. The Directive defines the varioustypes of tobacco product on which excise duty may be levied. It does not laydown any requirements regarding the taxation to be applied to those productsbut will facilitate any future harmonisation proposals affecting products otherthan cigarettes. The Directive will enter into force on 1 January 1980.Export Credits73. The export credit guidelines were reviewed by all participants (allmembers of the OECD except Turkey and Iceland) in October 1978. As a resultof the review the Council agreed on 16 November 1978 that the Communitywould continue to apply the unmodified guidelines until 31 May 1979. Theguidelines govern the extension of officially supported credits on terms of 2 yearsor more in order to contain destructive competition on credit terms betweencredit supplying countries.Capital Movements74. The United Kingdom continues to maintain certain restrictions onoutward direct and portfolio investment and various personal capital move-ments under the Commission^ authorisation of 22 December 1977 given underArticle 108 of the EEC Treaty.Harmonising of Public Purchasing75. A Directive came into effect aimed at harmonising public purchasingprocedures. The EEC Second Supplies Directive introduced common proceduresfor the advertising and award of central and local government supplies contractsover a threshold currently equivalent to about  130,000.14Section VI:   Regional and Industrial AffairsEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC): Loans76. Loans totalling  76 million were approved for the United Kingdom&apos;scoal industry and loans totalling  16 million were approved for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s steel industry. Under Article 56(2)b of the Treaty of Paris,  0.9million was contributed for readaptation benefits for redundant steel workers.European Regional Development Programme77. Because of the disagreement between the Council and the Assemblyabout the Budget for 1979, the amount of the Fund for 1979 was not decided.The Assembly voted for a Fund of 1000 million EUA plus 100 million EUA (ie10 per cent) to be allocated outside the quota, whereas the Council had agreedon a Fund of 620 million EUA of which 5 per cent would be allocated to a newnon-quota section. Amendments to the Regulation governing the administrationof the Fund were agreed by the Council, but subject to the conciliation pro-cedures with the Assembly.Review of Regional Aids78. The United Kingdom continued to supply the Commission with statisti-cal information, and also provided information on the United Kingdom systemof regional aids. Members of the Commission^ staff visited some UnitedKingdom regions as part of the Commission^ review of United Kingdom regionalaid system, which is expected to be completed in the first part of 1979.Science and Technology79. The Council adopted a second Three-year Plan of action in the field ofInformation and Documentation in Science and Technology, principally con-cerned with the implementation of Euronet as a public on-line informationnetwork and the development of its use. In the field of agricultural research itadopted joint research programmes as well as programmes for the co-ordinationof aspects of national research. A programme on forecasting and assessment inthe field of science and technology was adopted and the Council extended theplutonium recycling programme until 1980. In the action programme on the\ control and reduction of pollution caused by hydrocarbons discharged at sea,the Council agreed that relevant national and international research pro-grammes should be studied with a view to completing the Community pro-gramme of environmental research in this respect.Steel80. The United Kingdom steel industry continued to derive benefit from themeasures taken by the Commission to counter the effects of the world recessionon the Community steel market. These include the measures designed to liftprices to a more economic level, guidance on deliveries within the Communitymarket and agreements with the major supplying countries covering the pricesand volume of their sales to the Community. The weak state of demand con-tinued to depress steel prices and the Government therefore welcomed the15
recent decision of the Council to approve extension of the anti-crisis measures Kuntil the end of 1979 and negotiation of further twelve-month agreements withthe major supplying countries.81. The Commission is still engaged in its longer-term forecasts of steeldemand and supply which will form the basis of its proposals for restructuringthe Community steel industry. These plans and any related measures will haveto be worked out by the Commission and Member States in consultation.82. The Council adopted a resolution setting out general principles forspecific government aid for steel undertakings, but was not able to agreeproposals to give the Commission new powers to control such aid. The Councilare to reach a conclusion on further Commission proposals by 1 April 1979.Synthetic Fibres83. On 20 June 1978 synthetic fibre producers in the EEC (excluding thosewhich are subsidiaries of firms outside the Community) signed an agreementdesigned to bring supply into equilibrium with demand. However, the Commis-sion is dissatisfied with the agreement as it stands and is in touch with theproducers to see if any means can be found of ensuring that the agreement can bemade compatible with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome.Textiles and Clothing84. On 28 July 1978 the Commission issued a Communication to the Councilon general guidelines for a textile and clothing industry policy. The Corn-mission has held a series of meetings with the industry, trade unions and withMember States. More detailed proposals are expected from the Commissionin the light of these developments.^ (vAircraft Construction Industry85. The Commission^ review of the European Aircraft Industry and pro-posals for a Community role in this and related sectors was referred to a CouncilWorking Party. The wide ranging proposals set out in the Commission^ paperwill require careful consideration by Member States along with other devel-opments such as British Aerospace&apos;s entry into the Airbus Industrie con-sortium as a full member from 1 January 1979. Consideration is still beinggiven to the Commission^ proposals on aeronautical research, particularly ^in respect of the proposals for the helicopter sector.Shipbuilding86. On 19 September 1978, the Council of the European Communities ^adopted a resolution on the reorganisation of the shipbuilding industry. Thisresolution recognised the need to maintain within the Community a healthyand competitive shipbuilding industry consistent with the size of the Com-munity&apos;s maritime trade and respecting social, economic and strategic factors.The resolution stated that the necessary structural adjustments should be madetowards this end, taking into account medium and long-term market prospects.It also noted that the Commission would have market surveys carried outprior to giving its opinion on the structural adaption necessary and the way inwhich such adaption might best take place.87. Agreement was reached with the Commissioner for Competition in Julyon the provisional extension of the United Kingdom Intervention Fund tothe end of 1978. This extension was later confirmed by the Commission. Anumber of other Member States also announced their intentions to continueto aid their shipbuilding industries. Under the Fourth Directive on Shipbuilding,state aid must be accompanied by a restructuring of the industry; MemberStates (including the United Kingdom) either announced reorganisation plansor are in the process of formulating them.Company Law Harmonisation88. The Fourth Directive on company accounts was formally adopted on25 July; the Third Directive on mergers on 9 October. A directive on theadmissions of securities to stock exchange quotation was approved by theCouncil of Ministers on 19 December and will be formally adopted early in 1979.Intensive negotiations continued on a draft directive on group accounts, andon a number of other draft instruments including directives on prospectuses,unit trusts, disclosures of information by listed companies, a Convention onInternational Mergers, the draft Bankruptcy Convention and freedom ofestablishment for stockbrokers and jobbers. Also during this period a CompaniesBill was introduced into the House of Commons in November; this will,inter alia, implement the Second Directive on the formation and capital ofpublic companies.Insurance89. The draft directive on life assurance on an establishment basis wasagreed by the Council in December and is expected to be adopted early in1979. There was little progress however on the draft directive concerning thesale of non-life insurance across frontiers.Industrial Property90. Work continued on the steps which will be necessary to implement theCommunity Patent Convention when it comes into force. The creation of aCommunity Trade Mark is being considered by a working group in Brussels.The Government has already announced its wish to see the Community TradeMark Office located in London.Section VII:  Environment and Transport91. Environment Ministers met on 18 and 19 December 1978. On 18December there was a general discussion on the future of the CommunityEnvironment Programme. On 19 December, Ministers were able to agree inprinciple to two directives. The first, relating to the quality of water for humanconsumption, set quality standards for drinking water throughout the Com-munity, and the second, on the conservation of birds, established a level of birdconservation and protection throughout the Community approximatelyequivalent to that existing in the United Kingdom. A recommendation onmethods of evaluating the cost of pollution control to industry was also agreed.1617
Inland Transport92. A Council of Transport Ministers was held on 23 November 1978. TheCouncil discussed the Community Quota of permits governing the movement oflorries between Member States, and while they were unable to accept theCommission^ proposal for a 20 per cent increase, they agreed to a 10 per centincrease for 1979. They also agreed to extend and make permanent the commonrules for piggyback and other types of combined transport which were introducedon a trial basis in 1975. There were useful exchanges of views on a number ofother inland transport issues, notably the proposed Regulation to providefinancial aid for transport infrastructure projects of Community interest. On thisthe Council invited the Commission to submit by 1 January 1980 a report on thebottlenecks which the proposed Regulation might help to remedy; on the variouspossible modes of finance; and (in collaboration with the Committee onTransport Infrastructure) on criteria for evaluating projects.93. Another issue which the Council considered was heavy lorries, on whichthe German Presidency had tabled a new draft directive covering dimensionsbut not weights. The United Kingdom position was reserved, on the grounds thatwe have for some years pressed for higher standards on environmental aspects ofheavy lorries, and that any proposals involving an increase in vehicle dimensionsshould be looked at in that context.94. The public hearing of the Commission^ application to the EuropeanCourt of Justice for a declaration that the United Kingdom had failed to complywith EEC Regulation 1463/70 on tachographs took place on 13 December.Shipping95. The Community continued to discuss measures on maritime safety andpollution following the Amoco Cadiz disaster. Three instruments agreed by theTransport Council were adopted in December. These were directives relating tominimum requirements for tankers entering or leaving Community ports, and todeep sea pilotage in the North Sea and English Channel, and a recommendationfor early ratification by Member States of the recently concluded InternationalConvention on the Training, Certification and Watchkeeping of Seafarers.96. The Transport Council discussed further the activities of the fleets ofcountries whose practices threaten Community shipping. A decision was adoptedto monitor the level of services, cargo carried and prices charged by all linercarriers on the trade routes from the EEC to East Africa and Central America.The United Kingdom urged that the study of possible counter-measures,commissioned by the Transport Council in June, should proceed forthwith, sothat such measures could be adopted if need were established. There was alsofurther discussion aimed at achieving a common Community position on theUnited Nations Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences.Civil Aviation97. The Council&apos;s Transport Working Group examined a draft directive onaircraft noise, previously under consideration by the Environment Group. Apreliminary examination of some of the topics on the priority list for study in thefield of civl aviation began. Some progress was made in the establishment oflinks between the EEC and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) butit is unlikely that similar links will be possible with the International CivilAviation Organisation (ICAO).18Section VIII:   Social AffairsUnemployment98&apos;. Employment Ministers met informally at Frankfurt on 21-22 Septemberfor a general discussion of a number of subjects affecting the Communitylabour market. These included at the United Kingdom&apos;s initiative a dis-cussion of the need, at a time of continuing high unemployment, to take adequateaccount of employment considerations in determining Community policiesgenerally, including competition and industrial policies.99. A further Tripartite Conference attended by Finance and Labour andSocial Affairs Ministers, by representatives of the employers and trades unionorganisations at European level, and representatives of the European Assemblyand the Economic and Social Committee, was held in Brussels on 9 November.Discussion was based on a Commission Communication which described astrategy and actions for bringing about a recovery in the employment situation,taking into account the results of the programme of studies undertaken at therequest of the 1977 Tripartite Conference. The strategy was based on the needfor growth without inflation and for structural readaptation in industry, linkedto a number of complementary social measures.100. As on previous occasions the Conference did not attempt to reachformal agreements but the Presidency issued conclusions at the end of theConference which reflected a wide range of discussion. In these conclusions theCouncil and Governments of the Member States were urged to frame theireconomic and social policy decisions around the results of the Conference.These included acceptance of the need for early implementation of the policiesfor growth, agreed at the meetings of Heads of Government in Bremen andBonn in July 1978, the need to reduce disparities in regional development,the need for continued promotion of measures of training and re-training, andfor special employment measures to help groups such as the young, facing specialdifficulties. The Commission was asked to promote the development of theeconomic and employment situation on the basis of the document it hadsubmitted, in the light of the discussions at the Tripartite Conference and inregular consultations with representatives from both sides of industry. Inparticular, it was asked to do further work on a range of topics, includingthe practical possibilities for reducing the working week, the use of employmentpremiums, and ways of removing barriers to job-creation investment.European Social Fund101. At a meeting on 27 November, Labour and Social Affairs Ministersapproved new measures to promote the employment of young people; theywere formally adopted on 18 December and came into effect on 1 January 1979.Under the terms agreed, schemes in Member States which create jobs forunemployed young people under 25 years of age were made eligible for assist-ance from the European Social Fund. Two types of scheme are eligible: a. those which give subsidies to private sector employers who provideadditional jobs for young people, and19
b. those which finance the creation of jobs for young people whichfulfil a public need in the public sector, including jobs created in non-profit making bodies, but excluding jobs in central government or on theordinary establishments of public authorities.102. In 1978 the United Kingdom submitted applications for assistance fromthe Social Fund against the 1978 commitments budget totalling  127 million.Allocations notified for United Kingdom projects at 31 December 1978amounted to  34.85 million. Further allocations for 1978 are awaited.Social Affairs103. Among subjects considered by the Council Meeting in November was aprogress report on the proposal for a Directive on illegal migration and illegalemployment. It was recognised that the proposal as it stood presented diffi-culties for the United Kingdom. Discussions will continue with a view to findinga generally acceptable solution. The Sixth Annual Report of the EuropeanSocial Fund and the second European Social Budget were noted.104. Discussions continued on Commission proposals designed to eliminatebarriers to trade and at the same time to achieve standards acceptable fromthe point of view of health and safety. A Council Directive on the measurementof the noise level of construction plant and equipment was adopted on 18December.Social Security105. On 31 December 1977 the Commission presented their proposals forthe adaptation of the Council Regulation on the application of social securityschemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community,to extend it to self-employed persons and their families. Further proposedadaptations to extend the Regulations to include all insured non-employedpersons were presented on 29 September 1978. Discussion of the complexproposals has continued throughout the period under review.106. The Council meeting in November also reached agreement on aDirective on the equal treatment of men and women in social security. Thisprovides, subject to some exceptions affecting widowhood and maternity benefits,child benefit and certain other long-term benefits, that within six years men andwomen must enjoy equal entitlement to personal social security benefits andincreases for dependent adults and children. The Council agreed that a furtherinstrument should be prepared to apply the principle of equal treatment tooccupational schemes. The Directive on equal treatment in social security wasadopted on 19 December.Meeting of Community Health Ministers107. A meeting of EEC Health Ministers was held on 16 November 1978 todiscuss economic aspects of health care, health education policies including thoserelating to smoking and nutrition, vaccination and other subjects of mutualinterest. As a result the Commission will undertake further studies relating topharmaceutical products, specialised manpower and the harmonisation ofdefinitions and statistical data relating to health care. It was agreed to considerwhether present arrangements for advising the Commission on medical questionsshould be made more effective by the creation of a permanent body of experts.20Medical and Public Health Research108. A Council Working Party is to examine a proposal for a second seriesof projects on medical and public health research. It is proposed to co-ordinatework on five topics: causes of suicide; thrombosis; impaired hearing; perinatalmonitoring; and common standards for quantitative electrocardiography.Section IK: Education109. The United Kingdom Education Departments arranged consultationswith interested bodies on new Community proposals on the teaching of modernlanguages, of the study of Europe and the European Community in schools, andon student admissions. These proposals were to have been considered by EECEducation Ministers in November, but the meeting was cancelled by thePresidency and no new dates announced.Programme on the Transition from School to Work110. Arrangements were made for the evaluation of the British pilot projectsincluded in the EEC programme on the transition from school to work. ProfessorAlan Little of Goldsmiths&apos; College, University of London, will evaluate theprojects in Inner London, Sheffield and Bradford on the transition to work ofunder-achieving or unemployed youngsters. Mr Barry McDonald of the Centrefor Applied Research of the University of East Anglia will evaluate a project bythe National Institute for Careers Education and Counselling on in-servicetraining for teachers concerned with careers education and guidance. ProfessorAlan D Grant of Glasgow University will be responsible for the evaluation of aproject in Strathclyde on the transition to work.111. Nineteen (out of about 90) grants for study visits to other EEC countriesby specialists in vocational education and guidance were awarded to UnitedKingdom applicants.Other Fields112. A small Education Policy Information Centre was set up at the head-quarters of the National Foundation for Educational Research, Slough, to formthe United Kingdom part of a policy information exchange network in thecountries of the Community.113. Under EEC schemes of grants for 1978/79, applicants from the UnitedKingdom were awarded 13 (out of 59) grants for study visits in the field of highereducation; and 32 (out of 200) grants for study visits by local and regionaleducational administrators. Institutions of higher education in the UnitedKingdom were involved in 46 (out of a total of 58) projects awarded grants forthe development of &apos;joint study programmes&apos; (courses on which students spenda designated period abroad in another higher education institution).21
Section X: Energy114. The Energy Council on 30 October had a wide-ranging discussion of theCommunity and wider international energy situation. It also discussed Com-mission proposals for aid in the energy field to less developed countries andasked the Commission to prepare, in consultation with the developing countriesconcerned, inventories and an analysis of their energy resources and require-ments. Agreement was reached on a decision granting Community support totechnological projects in the hydrocarbons sector; and the Council also approveda Resolution on the exchange of information through a group of representativesnominated by Member States on problems arising from the siting of powerstations. There was no agreement on the Commission^ proposal for Communitysupport for joint hydrocarbon exploration projects; a group of experts wassubsequently set up to examine whether there were exploration projects meritingCommunity support.115. On 21 December the Council agreed a Recommendation for energysaving through the modernisation of buildings and requested further work to becarried out on the Commission^ proposals for Directives on the energy con-sumption labelling of domestic appliances. The Commission was also requestedby the Council to continue work on possible Community energy objectives for1990 and to report further to Ministers. The Council considered but was unableto reach agreement on the Commission^ 3 coal proposals to provide Com-munity support for coking coal, for intra-Community trade in power stationcoal and to promote the construction of coal-fired generating capacity in theCommunity. We made clear our deep dissatisfaction at the lack of progress oncoal and emphasised the importance of continuing work towards effectivesupport for Community coal.116. On demonstration projects in energy saving and alternative energiesthere was no final agreement on the further steps necessary to implement theschemes. The United Kingdom reserved its position on the terms of draftfinancial and implementing Regulations and on a possible overall ceiling forboth schemes of 150 million units of account.Section XI:   Institutional AffairsEmoluments for Directly Elected Members of the European Assembly117. Following the agreement between the Heads of State or Government atthe European Council on 4/5 December, salaries of directly elected members ofthe European Assembly will be paid by national governments at levels deter-mined nationally and will be subject to national taxation. A uniform system ofallowances will be paid by the Assembly and in the United Kingdom any excessover the actual costs incurred by members of the Assembly in the execution oftheir duties will be liable to taxation.22Committee of &quot;Three Wise Men&quot;118. At the meeting on 4/5 December, the European Council decided toappoint a Committee of &quot;Three Wise Men&quot; to review the machinery andprocedures of the Community institutions in the light of the prospective enlarge-ment to twelve. The European Council requested the Committee to conduct thisreview within the framework of the Treaties and to make recommendations forpractical changes which might be introduced quickly. The Committee is tosubmit its report in October.119. The members of the Committee are the Rt Hon Edmund Dell, MrRobert Marjolin and Mr Barend Biesheuvel.Foreign Ministers and Commission Reports on Progress in European Union120. As in 1977, Foreign Ministers and the Commission in their respectivespheres produced progress reports on the work done in various areas of Com-munity and political co-operation activity, under the general heading of Euro-pean Union. Both reports were noted by the European Council in December andsubsequently published by the Commission.Rights of Establishment121. Directives for the recognition throughout the EEC of dentists&apos;qualifications and for the co-ordination of training requirements leading to thosequalifications were adopted by the Council on 28 July 1978. Proposals for otherprofessions, including architects, midwives, pharmacists, accountants andfinancial advisers remain under consideration.Legal Co-operation122. The Council (Ministers of Justice) met on 9 October for the first timesince October 1974. The Ministers signed, on behalf of their Heads of State,the Convention on the Accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdomto the Convention of 27 September 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcementof Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, and to the Protocol of 3 June1971 on its interpretation by the Court of Justice (published as Cmnd 7395).The Ministers also adopted a declaration that they intend to use their bestendeavours to ensure that the Accession Convention was ratified quickly.Work has already begun on the preparation of United Kingdom implementinglegislation.European Court of Justice123. The number of cases brought before the Court has increased over thelast five years from 98 in 1974 to 158 in 1977 and 268 in 1978. The increase inthe first half of 1978 was particularly sharp, and led the President of the Courtto request the Council to agree an immediate increase in the number of Judgesand Advocates General, and to authorise further increases in the long term.This request was discussed by the Ministers of Justice on 9 October, togetherwith a note submitted by the United Kingdom suggesting amendments to theCourfs procedures. The Council asked the Court to make more detailed pro-posals, and undertook to set up a Working Party to consider those proposalsand those in the United Kingdom note.23
124. In the period under review, United Kingdom courts referred one caseto the Court. The Government has submitted observations in four other caseswhich have come before the Court for preliminary rulings, and has intervenedin support of Belgium in proceedings brought against Belgium by the Corn-mission concerned with certificates of authenticity for imports of Scotch whisky.125. In the same period, the United Kingdom was involved in three sets ofproceedings brought before the Court by the Commission alleging infringementof Treaty obligations by the United Kingdom. The first was mentioned inparagraph 94. The others concern respectively an alleged breach of Article 95of the EEC Treaty (affording indirect protection to one product by taxation ofanother product) because wine is taxed more highly than beer; and an allegedbreach of Article 30 of the Treaty (free movement of goods) because of a ban onpotato imports.Meeting of Community Ministers of the Interior126. The third Conference of Ministers of the Interior and Ministers withsimilar responsibilities from the Nine was held in Bonn at the end of November.Ministers reviewed progress of co-operation between Member States on mattersconcerned with law and order, and in particular on terrorism, and agreed afurther programme of work aimed at strengthening practical exchanges withinthe Community.Court of Auditors127. The Court of Auditors completed its initial visits to all Member Statesduring the period and continued to examine the question of co-operationbetween the Court and the National Audit Institutions. The first annual reportby the Court on the 1977 accounts of the Communities was submitted to theCouncil and the other Institutions on 30 November.Section XII: Parliament128.
