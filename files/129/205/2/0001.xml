ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1979INTRODUCTION1. This White Paper sets out the data considered during the Annual Reviewof the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agriculturalindustry. It provides information which can be drawn on by the Governmentin responding to the proposals by the EEC Commission for agricultural supportin 1979/80 and when decisions are taken on support arrangements whichremain within our national competence. As in 1978, these decisions will beannounced separately. In most cases the forecasts for 1978 reflect the positionas it was seen at November 1978.PART I-STATE OF THE INDUSTRY2 There was a substantial increase in production in 1978. Net product,which reflects the contribution made by the farming industry to the nationaleconomy, reached a record level some 5J% above the level in 1977. Theexpansion in 1978 owes a good deal to favourable weather, although therewere difficulties for the harvest in some parts of the country, particularly inScotland. The industry&apos;s costs, measured by changes in the prices of agriculturalinputs, show an increase of about 7 %. Agricultural net income excluding stockappreciation rose by 15% at current prices in 1977 and is expected to fall by3J% in 1978. This represents a fall of about 11 % in real terms in 1978. Thisfigure covers considerable variations between different sectors of farming anddifferent parts of the country. It reflects, for example, a sharp fall in returns onpotatoes from the very high levels of the years of shortage. The volume ofnew fixed investment which showed no change in 1977 is expected to increasein 1978 by about 2J%.3. Milk production in 1978 is expected to show an increase of about 4%mainly due to a continuing increase in yields. The decline in beef-type heifersin-calf has been slowing down, and beef production is likely to be 4-5 % higherthan in 1977. The sheep breeding herd continues to expand gradually andproduction of sheepmeat is expected to be about 8% higher than in 1977.The fall in the pig breeding herd has been reversed, so that although pigmeatproduction will be lower in 1978, it should increase in 1979. Production ofpoultrymeat and eggs expanded in 1978.4. Cereal yields have been high and production is expected to reach a newrecord level, of some 17-4 million tonnes. Potato plantings were lower than in1977 but yields have been high with plentiful supplies. The area of sugar beetharvested is expected to be higher than in 1977 and production of white sugaris likely to exceed 1 million tonnes.5. The value of horticultural output declined slightly in 1978 comparedwith the high level of 1977. This was due mainly to reduced prices resultingfrom increased supplies of apples and many field vegetables. The area of landunder horticultural crops was rather lower than in 1977; the greater part ofthe decline was in the field vegetables area, which returned to 1976 levels,although this reduction was offset by generally higher yields.1
PART H-COMMODITY TRENDSCereals (Tables 2, 5, 7 and 26)6. The area of cereals harvested in 1978 was 3-83 million hectares comparedwith 3-71 million hectares in the previous year. Production is expected to reachabout 17-4 million tonnes, compared with 16-7 million tonnes in 1977, anincrease of 4%. The favourable weather in the autumn of 1977 led to an increasein the area sown to wheat which was only partly offset by decreases in thebarley and oats areas. In the South the harvest was completed under idealconditions but in the North poor weather caused delays and losses. Averageyields were high, particularly for wheat, and the quality of the crops wasgenerally better than in 1977 when quality was affected by wet weather in theSouth. After the 1977 harvest, milling wheat prices rose steadily until July1978; then after a fall in August, the new crop prices rose slightly. Withabundant supplies available, feed grain prices fell and remained below inter-vention levels until March 1978 when prices became firmer. During the 1977/78season more than 2 million tonnes of barley were exported. Owing to excellentconditions in the autumn of 1978, the sowing of winter cereals is well advanced.Oilseed rape (Tables 2, 5, 8 and 26)7. Production of oilseed rape expanded to a new record level in 1978, owinglargely to a further increase in the area sown. Average yields in 1978 were ofthe same order as in 1977. Prices showed a moderate increase over the 1977level but remained around or just below the intervention price. A further slightincrease in production is expected, however, in 1979.Potatoes (Tables 2, 5, 9 and 26)8. In 1978 the target area of 200,000 hectares was exceeded by some 12,000hectares. Growing conditions were favourable and since yields are higherthan had been expected, there is likely to be a surplus, mainly of early varieties.In view of low producer prices early in the season the Potato Marketing Board,with Exchequer assistance, introduced market support operations with theaim of raising market prices, so that the average for the season achieves theguaranteed price of  43-94 per tonne. Discussions on an EEC potato regimehave continued but it remains uncertain how soon agreement will be reached.Sugar beet (Tables 2, 5, 10 and 26)9. For 1978 the British Sugar Corporation contracted to purchase the beetfrom 209,000 hectares. About 205,000 hectares are expected to be harvested,an increase on 1977. Weather during the growing season was generally goodand the yield of beet per hectare is greater than in 1977. Sugar content is slightlybelow the 1977 level but is still better than average. Assuming that harvestingand processing proceed satisfactorily, the crop should yield over 1 milliontonnes of white sugar. Contracting for 1979 has not yet been completed butthe Corporation aims to increase its contracted area again.Horticulture (Tables 2, 5, 11 and 26)10. The area devoted to horticultural crops, which was 302,000 hectares atJune 1977, fell to 290,000 hectares, which was about the 1976 level, mainly asa result of fluctuations in the field vegetables area. Details are given for the2
four commodities grown in the United Kingdom which are affected byCommunity intervention arrangements in the fruit and vegetables sector:(a) Apples. The area of apple orchards (excluding cider apples) continuesto decline slowly and was estimated to be 29,200 hectares in 1978.More intensive planting, however, has meant that productive capacityis being maintained, and crops of both dessert and culinary varietieswere a good deal greater in 1978 than in 1977, when the effects of thecold spring and the drought in 1976 reduced yields of dessert apples.Prices of dessert apples were high at the beginning of 1978, but fellduring the year and are likely to remain low until the summer of1979 because of plentiful supplies in the EEC generally.(b) Pears. The area under pears (excluding perry pears) has declinedslightly in recent years and was estimated to be 4,600 hectares in1978: the 1978 crop was substantially lower than the crop in 1977which was poor, but prices were generally lower in 1978 than in theprevious year.(c) Cauliflowers. The area under cauliflowers has stopped falling andwas about 15,000 hectares in 1978: cauliflower production was badlyaffected by poor weather at the beginning of 1978 but there wereabundant supplies in the autumn and prices were a little lower in1978 as a whole than in 1977 when they were high.(d) Tomatoes. About 1,000 hectares of glasshouse area were used fortomato production in 1978, this area having remained fairly constantfor many years: both production and prices were slightly higher thanin 1977.Hops (Tables 2, 5, 12 and 26)11. The area under hops remained stable in 1978 at about 6,000 hectares.Production in 1978 was well above that in 1977, when it was badly affectedby wet weather in the spring. Prices in 1978 were slightly higher than those in1977.Seeds (Table 13)12. The area sown for certified herbage and legume seed production in 1978(excluding field bean and field pea seed) rose by 22% after two low years.Despite the increased area sown, production is estimated to be well down on1977 when yields were unusually high. The supply situation is generally goodbecause of ample carry-over stocks. Prices generally are below 1977 levels,particularly for Italian ryegrass which is in potential over-supply. Imports in1977/78, particularly from non-EEC sources, were substantially down on1976/77, and home production in 1977/78 supplied over 55% of requirements.13. The areas sown for certified field bean and field pea seed production in1978 rose by 14% and 18% respectively, and production is expected to exceedseed requirements. Yields of field bean seed continue to be high. The expansionin the area sown for field pea seed appears to be levelling off, and productionis now expected to rise at a slower rate than was forecast a year ago.Beef and Milk (Tables 2, 5, 14, 15, 16 and 26)14. The 1978 June census for the UK showed a decline of about \\% in the3
total breeding herd, compared with the position at June 1977. The dairy herd about 66 % of all breeding cows showed a marginal increase (about 0-5 %)but the beef herd was some 6 % smaller.15. Home production of beef in 1978 is expected to be about 4-5% abovethat in 1977. Imports seem likely to remain close to the 1977 level but exportscould show some increase. After the end of March 1978 average market pricesfor certified cattle in the United Kingdom remained above the target price(except for two weeks in the summer when small amounts of premium werepaid in Northern Ireland only). Prices reached a peak of 71-27p per live kgfalling seasonally to 65-41p per live kg in the last week of October, but thiswas still l-51p per live kg above the target price. Because of the generallyfirm prices intervention was suspended for significant periods under the revisedarrangements introduced in 1978; at other times only moderate interventionwas needed to underpin the market. Prices in the specialist autumn sales ofsuckler calves in 1978 have been well up on the previous year.16. The average milk yield per cow in 1978 is expected to show an improve-ment of 4% on the 1977 level, while the size of the national dairy herd isexpected to increase only marginally over the previous year. As a result, milkproduction in 1978 is expected to show an increase of about 4% over that for1977. The amount of milk sold for liquid consumption in 1978 is expected tofall by about \\% compared with 1977 contributing, together with the growthin production, to an increase of about 10% in the availability of milk formanufacture. Cheese production in 1978 is expected to increase very slightlyover the previous year&apos;s level; and butter production is expected to rise byabout 22% to provide about 40% of the butter consumed in the UnitedKingdom.17. Since 1 January 1978 producer returns have been determined by theMilk Marketing Boards, on the basis of their returns from the liquid andmanufacturing milk markets. Thus prices for 1978 cannot be compareddirectly with the guaranteed price set for the 9 months from 1 April-31 December1977. It is expected that the Boards&apos; net returns from all milk for 1978 will beabout 10-8 ppl (49-0 ppg).18. The average size of the national dairy herd in 1979 is expected to remainat much the same level as in 1978, so that any increase in milk production willdepend on whether yields continue to improve.Sheep and Wool (Tables 2, 14, 18 and 26)19. Between June 1977 and June 1978 the total UK breeding flock increasedby 3-3% with increases in both the numbers of older ewes and of shearlingewes. The record lamb crop was just over 6% higher than in the previous yearand despite more slaughterings in 1978, the breeding flock is expected toshow a further increase in 1979.20. UK home production of sheepmeat in 1978 is expected to be about8% higher than in 1977 and imports to rise marginally. Thus, although exportsmay increase by 18%, available supplies to the UK home market are expectedto increase by 3%. In 1978 prices for fat sheep have been above the guarantee,4
except for four weeks in March and April, and about 10% higher than in1977. Prices paid for store lambs and hill ewes in most areas have again risenabove those paid in the previous year.21. Production of wool in 1978 has increased by 5%. When market pricespeaked in February 1978, they were 18% lower than the previous year&apos;s peakand have yet to respond to the return to firm prices in the world market. Theaverage auction prices forecast for the 1978 clip may again be slightly belowthe guarantee, and producers&apos; returns will be made good from the stabilisationfund built up from earlier surpluses.Pigs (Tables 2, 14 and 26)22. Increases in pig prices since towards the end of 1977 coupled withrelatively stable feed costs during much of 1978 have restored profitability topig producers.23. The decline in the size of the breeding herd which occurred during 1977has now been reversed and production of pigmeat is expected to be higher in1979 than in 1978. The improvement in profitability may encourage somefurther expansion of the breeding herd in 1979.Poultrymeat (Tables 2, 14 and 26)24. Output of poultrymeat is expected to show a small increase in 1978 butlittle change in production levels is expected for 1979. Poultrymeat prices haverisen during the year, the increase in duck prices being particularly marked.Eggs (Tables 2, 5, 17 and 26)25. Both the annual average size of the laying flock and output are expectedto show a small increase in 1978. Producers&apos; returns have been below 1977levels for much of the year and it is expected that this will result in a smalldecline in production in 1979.PART m-GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarm structure (Table 3)26. The number of farms in the United Kingdom continues to decline.In 1978 the total number of holdings was 258,000, that is about 4% lower thanin 1975. The fall in numbers continues to be most marked among the smallerfull-time businesses, while the number of large businesses (1,000 standardman-days or more) is increasing. Almost 50 % of holdings have businessescapable of providing work for at least one man (ie those of 250 standard man-days or more) but they account for 90 % of total output (although in NorthernIreland and Wales the output of small, part-time farms is rather more significantthan in other parts of the United Kingdom), while large businesses, althoughonly a little over 10% of the total number, produce about a half of total output.27. The average size of farms is increasing. The average area (total areaincluding rough grazings) of a full-time business of 250 standard man-daysand over is now 114 hectares compared with 111 hectares in 1975. Individualenterprises are also expanding, as the number of units declines and the trendto greater specialisation continues. There has been an increase in the average5
area of cereals from 30 to 34 hectares over the last three years and the averagedairy herd has expanded over this period from 40 to 46 cows. The average beefbreeding herd, at 18 cows, has declined slightly but the average ewe flock hasincreased to 173 breeding sheep compared with 164 in 1975. The average pigbreeding herd has increased from 23 to 28 sows, while fattening herds at June1978 reached an average size of 200 pigs compared with 156 in 1975.28. In Great Britain 63% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1978 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion of the totalarea held by owner-occupiers has increased from 52% in 1960/61 to 57% in1978. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.Index of net product (Table 19)29. There has been renewed expansion following the recovery in 1977 fromthe drought conditions of the two previous years. The index for 1978 is expectedto reach 122, well above 1977 and the pre-drought levels. This is mainly becauseof another record cereal crop combined with high output of milk and of somefield and horticultural crops.Labour productivity (Tables 4 and 19)30. The volume of output was affected by unusually adverse weather in 1975and 1976 and labour productivity (which is defined as the volume of grossagricultural product per person engaged) fell in both years. More favourableconditions led to substantial increases in both the volume of output andin labour productivity in 1977, and a further increase is forecast for 1978.Over the past ten years productivity has risen by nearly 4-J% per annumcompared with 5-5\% in the period before the two dry years of 1975 and1976. The outflow of regular whole-time workers has continued. In 1978the rate was 3 % compared with A\ % in 1977 and 5 % to 6 % per annum in the1960s.Net income of the industry (Tables 19, 21 and 24)31. Excluding stock appreciation (which is a form of investment ratherthan income) aggregate net income is now estimated to have risen by 15% to 1,301 million in 1977. A slight fall of 3J% to  1,256 million is forecast for1978. In real terms there was little change between 1976 and 1977 and areduction of about 11 % is expected in 1978.32. Further information examined at the Annual Review comes fromsamples of farm accounts analysed by type and size of farm and by country.The coverage and a number of the concepts in this series differ markedly fromthe aggregate calculation and no direct comparison between the two seriescan therefore be made. In particular the accounts relate only to full-timefarms, excluding particularly in England and Wales very large farms (notablypoultry farms) and do not cover horticultural holdings, while different treat-ments of valuations, depreciation and stock appreciation can significantlyaffect the year to which income from individual enterprises is attributed. Forthese and other reasons the latest farm accounts results (ending on average inmid-February 1978) show different changes in income from the aggregateseries.6
33. After rises in 1976/77 in all four countries, net income per farm excludingbreeding livestock stock appreciation averaged over all types (excluding horti-culture) fell in 1977/78 in England by 7 %, in Scotland by 33 % and in NorthernIreland by 9%, but rose in Wales by 16%. The main factors in the declinewere the dramatic fall in potato prices, lower poultry returns, and appreciableincreases in costs. The value of output of most crops (except potatoes) washigher reflecting, in part, a recovery from the 1976 drought, while output ofmost livestock was also up, in particular of sheep. With more plentiful suppliesof grass and fodder in England and Wales and only slightly higher concentrateprices, the feed bill generally rose much less than in the previous year. Therewere substantial increases in seeds, machinery, rent and miscellaneous items.34. With higher milk prices, a recovery in milk yields in England and Walesand higher cow and calf prices, incomes rose on specialist dairy farms; onother dairy farms, however, particularly those with potato enterprises, incomesrose only slightly and in Scotland they fell sharply. Most sheep farms benefitedfrom higher prices except in Scotland where these were offset by heavier costs.Incomes on mixed cattle and sheep farms varied considerably; the improvementin fat cattle prices from the end of 1977 onwards and the smaller rise in feedexpenditure led to increases in England and in Wales, but a drop in calf pricesin Scotland and higher costs overall reduced incomes in Scotland and NorthernIreland. Cropping farms in general suffered from the sharp fall in the value ofpotato output. On specialist cereal farms in England there was a compensatingincrease in cereals and a small rise in net income. But on general croppingfarms nearly everywhere the value of total output fell and income was down bya half or more. On pig and poultry farms there were increases in the value ofpigs and eggs output but lower prices during part of the year affected poultry-meat; and with higher costs, income fell again on average in England and Wales.In Northern Ireland, however, improved profitability of pigs pushed up theaverage income by 30%. In real terms incomes overall fell in England, Scotlandand Northern Ireland to the levels of the early 1970s while in Wales there wasno change.35. Forecasts for the 1978/79 year (ending on average in February 1979)made in the autumn of 1978 indicate a moderate to good recovery in netincome overall in England, some recovery in Scotland and Northern Irelandand a further increase in Wales. These changes reflect the good cereals andsugar beet harvest in England, larger milk output per cow and generally higherfatstock prices but egg and cull hen prices have been low for most of the year.Prices at the autumn sales for calves and in some areas for sheep have generallybeen substantially up on 1977. There should be a smaller rise in costs on averagealthough fertilisers, machinery repairs and rent are likely to have gone up bymore than other items. Prolonged autumn grazing in England and Wales,adequate stocks of winter fodder (although quality is variable in some areas),good cereal stocks and only small increases in concentrate prices for much ofthe year should have contained increases in feed costs. On dairy farms greatermilk output per cow and better cattle prices should push up income except inNorthern Ireland. Hill livestock farms should benefit from higher store andfat prices; the rise in store cattle prices may, however, affect lowland fatteners.On cropping farms in England average income is likely to show a good increasebut on general cropping farms it is not expected to restore the sharp fall in7
1911/78: while in Scotland the difficult cereals harvest may lead to a furtherdrop in income. Average pig and poultry income should rise in England althoughspecialist egg producers will have suffered from lower prices; in NorthernIreland a fall is forecast after last year&apos;s rise. In real terms average incomesshould rise in England and in Wales but show little change in Scotland andNorthern Ireland.Price changes36. After rising 5J% in 1977, prices of agricultural products are forecastto rise by 2% in 1978; for inputs, including labour, a rise of 14% in 1977 isexpected to be followed by one of 7% in 1978.Gross capital formation (Table 23)37. It is estimated that the value of new investment will increase againin 1978. The industry&apos;s gross capital formation in fixed assets of  925 million,will be 16% higher than in 1977; investment in plant, machinery and vehiclesis expected to be  650 million, an increase of 19%, and in buildings and works 275 million, a rise of 10% compared with the 1977 level. The value of stocksand work-in-progress, however, is expected to increase by less during 1978than in 1977, reflecting a smaller build-up of stocks of harvested crops. Involume terms investment in plant, machinery and vehicles is expected toincrease slightly. The fall in the volume of investment in buildings and workswhich began in 1973 was halted in 1977 and a further increase of 5 % is expectedin 1978.Taxation38. Tax changes introduced by the Finance Act 1978 will afford substantialadditional reliefs to the industry. They include averaging of incomes forindividual farmers and partnerships whose profits fluctuate substantially fromyear to year, improved and more flexible capital allowances for agriculturalbuildings and works, an increase in business relief under capital transfer taxfrom 30 % to 50 % and, for capital gains tax, the roll-over of gains on gifts ofassets used in a business and the improvement of retirement reliefs.Agricultural land prices (Table 22)39. Agricultural land prices in Great Britain reached a peak in 1973/74 andthen generally fell back. Prices subsequently recovered and have now reachedlevels above the previous peak. Information from the comprehensive InlandRevenue series, adjusted to take account of the lag inherent in this series,indicates an average price for vacant possession land in 1977 of  2,010 perhectare in England and of  1,327 per hectare in Wales. More recent informationfrom the less comprehensive ADAS/AMC series indicates a continuing rise inprices and suggests an increase in the average price in the 15 months since themiddle of 1977 of about 40% in England and in Wales. There was a similarrise in prices in Scotland with the average vacant possession price reaching 1,273 per hectare in the first half of 1978. The pattern was rather different inNorthern Ireland, where the average vacant possession price has shown asteady increase reaching  2,243 per hectare in the first quarter of 1978.8
Farm rents (Table 22)40. Farm rents in the United Kingdom are estimated to have increased byan average of 18% in 1978, based on the provisional results of the annualADAS Rent Enquiry in England and Wales and on continuing field enquiriesin Scotland. There was a similar percentage increase in rents in 1977.Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 20)41. In the calendar year 1977 the average earnings of whole-time hired menin the UK were  54-69 per week, including the rise of  2-50 in minimum ratesawarded in the winter of 1977/78. Compared with 1976 this was a rise of 9 % inmoney terms but a drop of about 6 % in real terms. In 1978 average whole-timeearnings are forecast to be about  61-50 per week, a rise of 12 % on 1977 inmoney terms and about 3  % in real terms.Public expenditure (Table 25)42. In 1978/79 the estimated outturn for expenditure in the United Kingdomon price guarantees, grants and subsidies (excluding the brucellosis incentivesand payments connected with the milk subsidy) is about  248 million. Thecomparable figure for 1977/78 is about  205 million. The principal increase inexpenditure occurs under the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme,where grant-aid is expected to reach a total of  52 million compared with 22 million in 1977/78. Other major increases involve payments under thepotato guarantee arrangements and Milk Non-Marketing and ConversionPremium Schemes. These increases are partly offset by the ending of the calfsubsidy.43. Expenditure under the common market organisation of the EEC isestimated at about  293 million in 1978/79, compared with expenditure of 185 million in 1977/78. This expenditure by the Intervention Board forAgricultural Produce includes the Beef Variable Premium Scheme, importand export refunds, certain production subsidies, the gross cost of aids toprivate storage and the net cost of commodities bought into intervention andsubsequently sold. Some of this expenditure benefits consumers and overseasexporting interests rather than producers. The additional expenditure in1978/79 is mainly due to increases in animal feed subsidies and export refundson third country trade.9

APPENDIXstatistical tablesThe tables cover largely the same ground as those in last year&apos;s White Paper except that:(a) Figures for home production as a percentage of UK food supplies and of indigenous-type supplies have been restored to Table 1 (after omission last year while the datafor previous years were converted to a calendar year basis);(b) More detailed information than in previous years is given in Table 1 on changes inthe price indices of inputs and outputs, following the decision to discontinue thetable of aggregate cost changes which appeared previously;(c) Table 6 now provides estimated quantities of animal feedingstuffs purchased byfarmers. This is the basis for assessing expenditure on feedingstuffs by the farmingcommunity as shown in Table 21;(rf) Table 22 has been recast to include agricultural land prices as well as the index ofgross rents.Even where there has been no change in the basis of the tables, some of the figures in thisappendix differ from those in previous Annual Review White Papers because of laterinformation, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statisticalmethods. The forecasts for 1978 generally reflect the position up to the end of the year, asseen at November 1978.All figures relate to the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.Figures for imports from and exports to the Eight relate throughout to the other countriesof the European Economic Community (Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, theIrish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in the tables.Figures for exports include re-exports.In some cases figures may not add up to the totals shown because of roundings.Symbols:  means &quot;nil&quot;... means &quot;negligible&quot; (less than half the last digit shown).. means &quot;not available&quot; or &quot;not applicable&quot;.11

Table 2 (continued)(a) The coverage for 1973 and onwards includes all known holdings in the United Kingdom with 40 standardman-days or more (a standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours productive work by an adult male workerunder average conditions). All holdings with less than 40 smd in Scotland are excluded. In England and Walesand Northern Ireland holdings with less than 40 smd are excluded only if they have less than 4 hectares ofcrops and grass and no regular whole-time worker. The same criteria applied in Great Britain in the years1970 to 1972, and in England and Wales in the years 1968 and 1969, except that the threshold for standardlabour requirements in those years was 26 smd.The 1967 figures for England and Wales, and the 1967-69 figures for Scotland, related to all known agriculturalholdings exceeding one acre (0-4 hectares) in extent. The figures for Northern Ireland for these years related toholdings of one acre (0-4 hectares) or more, except for numbers of livestock, which were collected from allowners, irrespective of the size of the holding, as well as from landless stockholders.The introduction of the changes of definition in Northern Ireland in 1973, following similar changes in GreatBritain which excluded some 14,000 statistically insignificant holdings in 1970 and about 8,000 in 1973, hadthe net result of eliminating about 6,000 or so holdings from the Northern Ireland census.(b) For threshing.(c) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales.id) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(e) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by theglasshouse area.if) Includes area of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(g) Includes lucerne.(A) Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales &quot;clover, sainfoin and temporary grasses&quot;;In Scotland  &quot;grass under 7 years old&quot;;In Northern Ireland   &quot;1st, 2nd and 3rd year&quot;.(0 Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales &quot;permanent grass&quot;;In Scotland  &quot;grass 7 years old and over&quot;;In Northern Ireland  &quot;4th year or older&quot;.(7 ) Includes common rough grazings.(k) Returns of &quot;other land&quot; were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June 1969. From June 1969to June 1973 &quot;other land&quot; in Great Britain was collected as woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings,etc., the use of which was ancillary to farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it included land within agricui-tural holdings which was under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not used for agriculture.In June 1974 the definition was changed in England and Wales to include all other land forming part of theholding and in Scotland it was extended to include ponds and derelict land. The Northern Ireland definitionis unchanged.15

Although the figures quoted for 1975and 1978 are strictly comparable, great caution must be exercised in comparing them with figures quotedin earlier Annual Review White Papers. The figures included for Northern Ireland in the first two sectionsfor both years relate only to holdings with 50 smd or more.The average size of holdings based on total area was -1975 66-1 hectares of which 45-2 hectares were crops and grass1978   67-6 hectares of which 47-4 hectares were crops and grass.These figures include holdings with no crops and grass area which are excluded from the first section of thetable.Revised standard man-day groups were adopted last year when the lower group of under 250 smd appliedthroughout the UK. The change in smd values has meant a general shift of holdings into lower size groupsand this movement is particularly marked in Northern Ireland as the following figures show: (e)(/)(g)Based onold smd values50-199 smd 16-0200-599 smd 12-6600-1 199 smd 3-81 200 smd and over 1-2Total 33-6Holdings in Northern Ireland-June 1975 (&apos;000)Based onnew smd values50-249 smd250-499 smd500-999 smd1 000 smd and overTotal20*06-92-80-730-4As a result of this change, the figures shown in this table are only comparable with those in the 1978 WhitePaper.Figures relate to England and Wales only.Figures included for Scotland and Northern Ireland relate to the December censuses in 1974 and 1977.Figures included for Northern Ireland relate to pig holdings which had fattening pigs only.Figure for Scotland, and figures for Northern Ireland in 1978 only, include small numbers of other tablefowls.18

They include some estimates for figures notdirectly obtainable from the Scottish Census results and for that reason they differ slightly from some of thepublished United Kingdom Census results. Because of changes in the Census categories in England and Walesin 1970 and 1972, numbers returned for earlier years are not available on the same basis as those for the mostrecent years. Before 1977 the figures do not include the wives/husbands of farmers, partners and directors,even though the wives/husbands themselves may be partners or directors. In 1977 wives/husbands of farmers,partners and directors were returned separately, but only if they were engaged in farm work.(b) Figures relate to Great Britain only.(c) Includes seasonal or casual workers in Northern Ireland. See footnote (d).(d) Before 1975 seasonal or casual workers were not returned as a separate itemi n Northern Ireland, but wereincluded with part-time workers.(c) The increase in numbers of farmers, partners and directors in 1976 occurred in England and Wales and isthought to reflect a more complete enumeration in the Agricultural Census.(/) The decrease in the number of regular whole-time and part-time female workers in 1977 is thought to beexplained by the separate return, for the first time in England and Wales, of farmer&apos;s wives, some of whomwere probably returned previously as family workers.19

The occupiers&apos;investment includes all tenant-type physical assets in livestock, crops, machinery, etc. but excludes any financialassets and all landlord-type assets such as land and buildings. These figures are not directly comparable withincomes in other sectors of the economy, since farm income also includes elements of wages and changes instock valuations as well as profits.(b) Net income at current prices, including stock appreciation (see note (v) to Table 21) was  1 825 million in1976,  1 746 million in 1977 and  1 737 million in 1978.(c) Net product (net output) measures year-to-year changes in the value-added at constant prices by fanners,landowners and farmworkers to all the goods and services purchased from outside the agricultural sector.(d) Labour productivity is defined here as gross product per person engaged in agriculture. Gross product isgross output less all inputs other than depreciation, labour, net rent and interest. It is measured here at constantprices. In order to be consistent with national economic conventions, gross product as used in the calculationof labour productivity covers agricultural contractors as well as all commercially significant holdings. Thetotal number of persons engaged in agriculture comprises the number of employees, employers and self-employed (excluding farmers&apos; spouses) recorded in the annual June census taken by the Agricultural Depart-ments. Before 1971, however, the trends in numbers of employers and employees were estimated respectivelyfrom the Population Censuses and the Department of Employment count of national insurance cards.Table 20Average earnings and hours of agricultural workers (a)Calendar years	1974	1975	1976	1977	1978 (forecast)Earnings   per week (b) Hours per week (c) ......	34-07 45-9	42-92 46-0	50-28 45-5	54-69 45-9	61-50 45-6(a) For all hired regular whole-time male workers 20 years old and over.(6) Earnings include pay for statutory holidays and payments-in-kind which are valued at rates set down by theAgricultural Wages Boards and comprise houses, milk, potatoes, etc. (the principal one being houses, most ofwhich were, in England and Wales, valued at 50p before 20 January 1976 and  1-50 thereafter).(c) AH hours worked and statutory holidays.35

Land-lords&apos; current expenses and landlords&apos; depreciation are included in Farm Maintenance and Depreciationrespectively and hence the whole of Gross Rent is treated as a cost to the industry. The estimates of GrossRent are  226-6 million in 1974,  263 million in 1975,  311-2 million in 1976,  367 million in 1977 and  432-1million in 1978.iu) On commercial debt for current farming purposes.(v) Stock appreciation measures that part of the change in the book value of stocks and work-in-progress attribut-able to the change in the cost of inputs between the beginning and end of year.38

See note (c).(a) The Inland Revenue series excludes sales of less than 4 hectares (ha) in England and in Wales, of less than 5 ha(8 ha before 1976) in Scotland and of less than 2 ha in Northern Ireland as well as land sold for developmentand other n on-agricultural purposes. In addition, the series shown for Scotland refer to equipped farms onlyand exclude sales of unequipped land, whole estates, land sold for afforestation and inter-family sales.There is a delay between the date on which a sales is agreed and the date on which it is included in the series.The delay is thought to average about 6-9 months in England and Wales and about 3 months in NorthernIreland. The average prices shown in the table for each calendar year relate to sales included in the series for thesecountries in the years ending in the following September and March respectively. In the case of Scotland, theproblem is overcome by further analysis of the information by date of sale. The data for Scotland and NorthernIreland are subject to retrospective revision.6) The gross rent indices for England and Wales are based on an annual rent enquiry and for Scotland on con-tinuing field enquiries. They refer to the rents prevailing during the calendar years indicated. Very little landis rented, except under the conacre system, in Northern Ireland,(c)  The figures for the most recent years are subject to revision or are based on incomplete information as detailedbelow:Agricultural Land PricesScotland: 1978 figures relate to prices in the first 6 months of the year.

Investment in plant andmachinery is normally tenant-type. Investment in buildings and works is normally landlord-type. In practice,however, there are many variations in the division between the two responsibilities. The figures in the tablerepresent gross expenditure before crediting any grants which reduce the cost to the owner or occupier. Annualcharges in the form of depreciation on fixed capital are made for these items in calculating aggregate farming netincome.(6) SeeTabIe21 (Item 1 Oplus item 22 minus item 15).39

Table 24 (continued)(a) These figures are collected by Universities and Agricultural Colleges in Great Britain and the Departmentof Agriculture in Northern Ireland. They are averages weighted by the census distribution of agriculturalholdings by type of farming and size of business. More detailed figures for England and Wales will be publishedin &quot;Farm Incomes in England and Wales 1977/78 &quot;, for Scotland in &quot;Scottish Agricultural Economics 1978&quot;,for Northern Ireland in &quot;Farm Incomes and Investment in Northern Ireland from 1975/76 to 1977/78 &quot;, andfor Wales in the &quot;Annual Digest of Welsh Agricultural Statistics 1977/78, Part II&quot;. Net income is defined as intheaggregate series (Tables 19 and 21) except that stock appreciation is assessed at current market prices and thatno deduction is made for interest on farming debts. Net income is shown in this table again excluding thatpart of the total valuation change which is attributable to changes during the trading year in estimated marketvalues (but not in the numbers) of breeding cattle, sheep and pigs. Footnote (v) to Table 21 describes thedifferent definition of stock appreciation deducted in the corresponding aggregate series. All farms are treatedas rented and an imputed rental value is charged as an expense in the accounts of owner-occupiers. The accountsrelate in the main to calendar years ^or to the year ending 5 April. The average year-ending date is aboutmid-February.(b) Based on standard labour requirements per unit of crop area and per head of livestock at 1968 levels(see Table 3, footnotes (a) and id)).(c) Includes &quot;mixed&quot; farm type but excludes &quot;pigs and poultry&quot;, &quot;cropping&quot; and &quot;horticultural&quot; farm types.id) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannot beimputed with reference to tenanted farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildings have beenassessed in relation to estimated sale value. Where land was taken in conacre, the actual rents paid have beenincluded. For these reasons the average net incomes per farm are not on the same basis as those for GreatBritain.ie) Includes &quot;cattle, sheep and pigs&quot;, &quot;dairy with pigs and poultry&quot; and &quot;cropping&quot; farm types.Table 25Public expenditure under the common agricultural policy (CAP) and onnational grants and subsidies (a)April/March (financial) years   million	1974/75	1975/76	1976/77	1977/78	1978/79 (forecast)I   Price guarantees and production grants (i) Price guarantees on products supported by the CAP (6) ...						0-3			-	-(ii) Price   guarantees   on other products Sheep ............

Table 25 (continued)(a) This table excludes expenditure which may benefit farmers but where the value to them is not shown by theexpenditure (e.g. expenditure on animal disease and pest control or on research, advice and education). Expendi-ture on agriculture in Northern Ireland, borne on the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund, is also excluded.It does, however, include some expenditure which benefits consumers and overseas exporting interests ratherthan producers (see note (g)). The figures for years up to and including 1976/77 represent actual expenditurerecorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1977/78 are subject to confirmation and those for1978/79 are the latest estimates of expenditure.(6)  Excludes payments for milk which have been attributed to the food subsidies programme.(c) Payments in respect of wool and potatoes relate partly to the clip or crop of the year indicated and partly tothe clip or crop in the preceding year or years. The negative figures reflect the arrangements with the BritishWool Marketing Board, whereby deficiency payments made by the Exchequer are repayable from surpluses(excess of market price over guaranteed price) up to the amount of debt owing by the Board to Ministers.(d) Farmers in special areas are also eligible for additional assistance under the Farm and Horticulture DevelopmentScheme and the Farm Capital Grant Scheme. The estimated benefit is shown separately in section III of the table.(e) Includes grants in respect of investment on self-propelled machines (agricultural and horticultural), credit&apos;,farm structure loans&apos;, producer organisations4, small horticultural production businesses, small farmers, farmbusiness records, water supply*, agricultural drainage*, special assistance to livestock producers and hopsrestructuring. (Provision for the schemes marked* was included in the 1978/79 Supply Estimates.)(/) Includes grants for improvement of hill land and livestock rearing land, rural roads&apos;, forage groups*, producersin the Scottish Islands&apos;, crofting improvements&apos;, hill cattle agistment subsidy and hill livestock and young stockscheme. (Provision for the schemes marked&apos; was included in the 1978/79 Supply Estimates.)(g) The figures shown are total expenditure before allowing for receipts from FEOGA which are shown separatelyat the foot of the table. The figures are made up of several elements and include import refunds (net of exportlevies) on intra-Community trade, import and export refunds on third country trade, the beef premium scheme,aid for/private storage and animal feed, certain production subsidies and the net cost of commodities boughtinto intervention and subsequently sold. Some of the expenditure benefits consumers and overseas exportinginterests rather than producers. The figures for 1974/75, 1975/76 and 1976/77 include the special import sub-sidy on sugar and those for 1978/79 include the UK share of the EEC School Milk Subsidy Scheme. Theconsumer subsidy on butter is not included.(a) Includes eggs, poultrymeat, fruit and vegetables, oilseeds, hops, herbage and legume seeds, dehydrated fodder,fisheries and flax. Also includes expenditure on products covered by the cap but not produced to any signifi-cant extent in the United Kingdom (olive oil, rice, wine and hemp).43
