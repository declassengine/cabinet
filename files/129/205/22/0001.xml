CONFIDENTIAL$VOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 22 COPY NOCO19 March 1979CABINETINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY:   THE PRINCIPLE OF THESINGLE CHANNELMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment1. I strongly urge my colleagues to maintain the principle of the singletrade union channel as adopted in the White Paper on Industrial Democracy(Cmnd 7231) subject, of course, to the inclusion of appropriate safeguards toensure that arrangements are properly representative - ie Option A.2. Apart from the unfortunate impression which would result from uschanging our minds on this crucial issue at this late stage - I do not accept thatthe events of the last few months have materially affected the situation - thereare many good industrial relations reasons for adopting the single-channelapproach.    I will give only two.    We cannot ignore the complex and highly-developed arrangements for communication and consultation which alreadyexist in companies as a result of the high degree of union membership. Toadopt new procedures for extending participation which cut across the existingstructures for collective representation could only make for tension andconflict.    Secondly, if the aim of the legislation is not just to give employeesrights to participate in decision-taking, but also to bring about sharedresponsibility for decisions when taken, then the chances of achieving this aregreatly diminished if the method of choosing employee directors is taken outof the hands of the unions acting jointly through the Joint RepresentationCommittee (JRC).3. Moreover, Option B would seriously undermine any continuing role forthe JRC.    Given the problems caused by multiunionism in many largecompanies, the concept of the JRC, as a body to which all recognised tradeunions, white-collar or blue-collar, affiliated or unaffiliated, have a right tobelong, is a most hopeful one.    It could bring real benefits by encouragingcollective and co-operative action between unions in place of the presentsectional approach and inter-union conflict and rivalry.    We should notabandon the JRC as the central pillar of the Government&apos;s proposals.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. If we abandon the single channel method, with the appropriatesafeguards, we could end up with a Bill which nobody wanted: it. would berejected by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and still fiercely opposed bythe employer lobby.    If enacted, the legislation could prove a dead letter.THE JOINT REPRESENTATION COMMITTEE5. The pattern of inter union co-operation in companies is complex.In some cases there are joint shop stewards committees though these maynot cover white collar workers and may have limited functions.    In othersthere is no equivalent body to the JRC and the lack of any forum of thiskind inhibits good industrial relations.    The development of JRCs will notonly be beneficial to unions and employees but also to companies and theeconomy as a whole.    If we place too many barriers in the way ofestablishing JRCs we shall not get them: unions will continue to pursuetheir sectional interests and the great potential benefits to both sides ofindustry   will not mature.6. The proposals in paragraph 7 of the Secretary of State forEducations paper (CP(79) 21) make the tests of the representative characteof the JRC in my view totally disproportionate to any burden which mightbe placed on the company from having to comply with the obligation todiscuss.    We have always recognised that there are no really effectivesanctions to require employers to consult fully in accordance with thespirit of the legislation (as distinct from going through the motions). Lathis situation the safeguards already contained in paragraph   8 of Annex Aare, in my view, and I am sure in the view of those in industry, fullyadequate.CONCLUSION7. I urge my colleagues not to abandon the principle of the singlechannel and to dispense with the suggested tests for the representativenessof the JRC proposed in paragraph 7.A E BDepartment of Employment19 March 19792CONFIDENTIAL
