SECRETOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 2520 March 1979CIVIL SERVICE PAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Prices andConsumer Protection1. EY(P) considered the 1979 pay settlement for the non-industrialCivil Service last week.    They failed to agree on the offer which shouldbe made, and asked me, as acting Chairman, to report the matter toCabinet.2. The Government agreed in 1977, following a report from aMinisterial Group (GEN 64) to reactivate the Pay Research System forthe 1979 settlement, with various changes designed to improve itseffectiveness and confirm its objectivity.    Those changes have been made.The work of the Pay Research Unit (PRU) is now supervised by anindependent Pay Research Unit Board (PRUB) which has full access to allthe data provided to the PRU.    Processing of this year&apos;s survey materialis now nearly complete.    It covers non-industrial grades up toAssistant Secretary.    Starting from the identified analogues in theprivate sector, and adjusting for various factors such as fringe benefitsand the value of index-linked pensions, the PRU evidence shows thatlarge increases are justified.    These average about 25 per cent, butare tilted largely in favour of the higher grades.    The Ministers concernedhave seen the details, but for reasons of internal security following aseries of damaging leaks, I am not circulating them.3. The Lord Privy Seal proposed to make offers to the unionsconcerned based upon this material as follows:-a. Increases based upon the PRU evidence should be negotiatedfor grades up to Principal.b. Decisions on the pay at Assistant Secretary and SeniorPrincipal level should be postponed until after receipt of thenext report of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) which islikely to be available in mid-April,    This is because therecommended rates for Assistant Secretaries would otherwiseexceed those for Under Secretaries.c. Decisions on London Weighting should be deferred, but anindication should be given to the unions that the cost of a furtherincrease might be funded from savings on the pay of highergrades.1COPY NO31CABINETSECRET
SECRETd. The job security argument should be pressed hard innegotiation for all grades, and used as a reason for reducingthe pay increases for Assistant Secretaries and Senior Principals.e. The settlement should be applied to controlled fringe bodies,f. The initial payment should be 9 per cent on 1 April 1979 andthe balance of the settlement should be staged in on 1 October 1979and 1 April 1980.g. Some further desirable small changes should be made, withinthe total allowance for drift.h. The full rates should be promulgated for pensions purposesfrom 1 April 1979.4. Many members of EY(P) were dissatisfied with the proposals on anumber of points.    They were concerned about the objectivity andindependence of the PRU system.    They thought that the absolute size ofsome of the indicated increases was unjustified (although noting that it wasnot yet.proposed to apply them in full for Assistant Secretaries or SeniorPrincipals).    They were not satisfied that sufficient allowance had beenmade for job security or the value of pension rights.    They consideredthat some at least of these factors could be referred to arbitration withoutany breach of faith.    They were very worried about the proposed initialpayment of 9 per cent on 1 April 1979.    They noted that this was much morethan would be justified by a strict application of the pay guideline of5 per cent plus low pay underpinning plus a small negotiating margin: thiswould mean an initial payment of only 6 per cent.    They objected to theproposed staging, which would have given civil servants the full ratereached in negotiation spread over 12 months;  this might appear moregenerous treatment than had been offered to any other public sector group.In their view it would be impossible to prevent similar treatment beingextended to the rest of the public services, and notably to nurses andteachers.    Notwithstanding the Sub-Committee&apos;s earlier decision, and theindications which had been given to the unions, a majority felt that stagingshould be extended beyond 1 April 1980.5. On the other hand, Cabinet will need to bear in mind that theGovernment itself decided to reactivate the pay research system in 1977following a careful examination.    Since then it has developed the principleof comparability into a major element of its pay policy in the public sector.The new Standing Commission on Comparability will use the PRU for partof its staff support.    It would be a mistake to cast doubt publicly on theprinciple or practice of comparability.    The Government is partlycommitted to implementation by 1 April 1900 by the terms of the authorisedstatement to the unions and by the subsequent assurance by the Secretaryof State for Scotland in the House of Commons on 12 March that: &apos;TheGovernment have already said that the staging will be completed by no laterthan 1 April 1980. &apos;    (Handsard, 13 March 1979, col 288).2SECRET
SECRET6. Cabinet will also need to consider that, under the terms of thePay Agreement with the Civil Service unions, a further PRU settlementis due in April 1980 and the unions are pressing for an assurance that theresults of next year&apos;s pay research will be implemented in full on the duedate.    It is also relevant that technically, if the present settlement is notreached by 1 April this year, the operative date would be lost.    The staffwill claim that this is the Governments fault because of the latere-activation of the pay research system.    It may be necessary to givean assurance at the appropriate t?.me that the first stage of the settlementwill be backdated to 1 April 1979.7. The views of EY(P) on the various proposals are therefore as followa.    The evidence produced by the PRU should be used as a basisfor negotiation of pay up to the grade of Principal.    The Sub-Committee were equally divided on whether the Governmentshould go to arbitration over the adjustments for job securityand pensions.h.    We agree that decisions on pay at Assistant Secretary andSenior Principal level should be deferred until the TSRB reportis available in April,c. A decision on London Weighting should be deferred.d. Subject to the decision about arbitration (a. above) thequestion of job security should be pressed hard in negotiations.It should in any case be used as a justification for reducing thepay increases for Assistant Secretaries and Senior Principals.e. The settlement should extend to controlled fringe bodies.f. A large majority of the Sub-Committee believe that theopening offer for the initial payment on 1 April should be limitedto 6 per cent and that the eventual figure for that payment shouldnot exceed 8 per cent:  and that the remainder of the settlementshould be paid in two equal instalments on 1 December 1979 and1 August 1980.    But this is the crucial issue for the negotiations.Possible alternative staging patterns are displayed in the Annex.g. Any very small changes desirable on management groundsshould be accommodated within the drift margin.h. A large majority considered that, following precedent, thenew rates should be promulgated for pensions purpose from1 April 1979.8. I seek the Cabinet1 s views on point a. above and I recommend theremaining items for approval.R HDepartment of Prices and Consumer Protection20 March 1979SECRET
