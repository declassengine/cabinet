CONFIDENTIALPCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 23 COPY NO20 March 1979CABINETTHE CONTINGENCY RESERVE 1979-80Memorandum by the Chief Seeretary, Treasury1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer told the Cabinet on 1 March(CM(79) 10th Conclusions, Minute 7) that, as a contribution to achieving ourPublic Secior Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) target, he was consideringproposing a cut in the 1979-80 Contingency Reserve for announcement in theBudget.    This would reduce the total of public expenditure originallyplanned for 1979-80 without the need for new cuts in programmes alreadysettled.2. If we are to make such a cut, we need to decide, and announce, thatsubsequent decisions to add to the volume of expenditure in 1979-80 will becontained within the balance of the Contingency Reserve which will remain.This decision must be realistic in relation to foreseeable bids on theReserve.THE BALANCE NOW REMAINING IN THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE3. The decisions we took last week on uprating social security benefitsand child benefit account for nearly all the  200 million or so alreadycharged to the original Contingency Reserve of  800 million at 1978 Surveyprices, and leave a balance of about  600 million still available.REQUIREMENTS IN THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR4. I assume that the Cabinet will not want to foreclose at this stage thepossibility of measures which in previous years we have taken at a laterstage, such as a Christmas bonus and a winter fuel scheme.    Allowing forsuch possibilities and some others inevitable this year, including the costof General and European Economic Community (EEC) Elections, myjudgment is that we need to retain about  300 million at 1978 Survey pricesto cover requirements later in the year.    If we decide now to limit futureuse of the Reserve to this amount, we could cut the Reserve by  300 millionat 1978 Survey prices.    This would be a useful contribution to theChancellor1 s Budget action.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. This judgment depends on two critical as sumptions:-i. Apart from those mentioned in paragraph 4, we rule outother options which would involve substantial expenditure in 1979-80.ii. In accordance with the decision of the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy (EY) last week, the necessary decisions aretaken to contain the nationalised industries&apos; financing requirementswithin the provision in the last Public Expenditure White Paper; andthat the cash limits are set in accordance with the proposals I havecirculated to colleagues in EY.CONCLUSIONS6. Provided that Cabinet confirm the assumptions in paragraph 5 above,I propose that we decide to reduce the Contingency Reserve by  300 millionat 1978 Survey prices, and to contain the cost of subsequent decisions withinthe balance of about  300 miLUon remaining in the Reserve;  and announcethese decisions in the Budget.J BTreasury Chambers20 March 19792CONFIDENTIAL
