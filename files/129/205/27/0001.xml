CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 27 QnCOPY NO26 March 1979CABINETCASH LIMITS AND PAYMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. The Government1 s attitude towards adjusting cash limits in respectof pay settlements was agreed by Cabinet on 22 February (CM(79) 9thConclusions, Minute 8), and set out in my statement of 23 February; therelevant extract is at Annex A.    We need to consider how we are going toapply this policy in relation to a number of settlements now facing us,particularly in the local authority field.LOCAL AUTHORITIES2. For local authority manual workers, we have agreed to pay, throughRate Support Grant (RSG) our normal share (61 per cent in England and Waleof the cost of the settlement.    But that settlement was heavily influenced bythe proportion of low-paid workers, and we are not committed to such alarge contribution towards other settlements.    We have said that our futuredecisions will depend on the circumstances of each case.    In consideringparticular cases, it is now clear that we need to decide what generalprinciples we should apply.3. For teachers, we have agreed to contribute our normal RSG sharetowards an initial offer of 8 per cent;  but we have taken no decision aboutcontributing towards any comparability payments in 1979-80.    The othermajor local authority settlement which will be affected by a general decisionnow will be that for white collar (Administrative, Professional, Technicaland Clerical Services) workers, with effect from 1 July.4. It would be possible for us to agree, as a general rule, to pay ourfull RSG share on any future settlement (including comparability) for localauthority staff.    I would not recommend this course.    It would be wrongfor us to rule out any possibility of obtaining some offsetting economies ifsettlements turn out to be excessive.    It would be seen to be inequitable bycomparison with our attitude to Civil Service pay settlements, where weare asking Departments to plan for manpower cuts of at least 2 per cent.It would be unnecessarily generous:   local authorities already have largebalances and are making large increases in local rates. iCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. For these reasons, I propose that we should now agree to tell thelocal authority employers that in respect of any eventual settlement(including comparability) which we approve for teachers and any otherlocal authority groups in this pay round, we shall pay our RSG share on2 per cent less than the cost in 1979-80 of such settlements, to the extentthat this exceeds what has already been accepted (8 per cent in the caseof teachers, 5 per cent plus underpinning for the generality).6. On this basis, I would agree that the RSG treatment which weaccepted for the manuals settlement should be applied in the case of anyof the small groups whose pay is determined consequentially on that for themanuals and for whom we approve a similar pay settlement.7. In the case of teachers, I suggest that it should be made clear thatwhile we would contribute on the proposed basis towards an approvedsettlement including comparability, this undertaking would not extend to anarbitration award.    If the teachers&apos; claim goes to arbitration, we shouldreserve our position on the implications for RSG.CENTRAL GOVERNMENT8. Following my statement of 23 February, plans are being preparedon the assumption that expenditure on manpower in Central GovernmentDepartments will be cut by at least 2 per cent.    The National Staff Sidehave been so informed.9. On the National Health Service (NHS) and armed forces, my minuteof 22 March to the Prime Minister made some proposals, after discussionwith the Secretaries of State concerned.    On the NHS I proposed that,subject to possible reconsideration in the event of a very high settlement,we should plan for 2 per cent cuts in respect of NHS staff apart from nursesand others directly in support of patients.    On the armed forces pay award,I proposed a formula which ruled out any reduction in armed forces numbersas a means of financing the award, but did not entirely rule out thepossibility of some further squeeze elsewhere in the Defence Budget. ThePrime Minister has now asked for these proposals to be considered furtherand I am sending him a separate minute about them.10. For all other bodies in receipt of Central Government funds (otherthan local authorities) I propose that the treatment should be similar tothat envisaged for Central Government Departments.    For expendituretreated as pay in setting the cash limits, the bodies concerned should beadvised to plan on the assumption that cuts of at least 2 per cent will berequired to offset any settlements in excess of the present provision.Among the bodies which I propose should be treated in this way are theuniversities.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRECOMMENDATIONS11.       In summary, my recommendations are:i. For future local authority pay settlements ixrthia round,our RSG  share should be paid on 2 per cent less than the full cost(to the extent that this exceeds what we have already undertakento meet for these groups).ii. For universities and other bodies (other than localauthorities), expenditure treated as pay in setting the cash limitson the finance provided by Central Government should be subjectto at least a 2 per cent cut, on the same basis as for GovernmentDepartments; and the bodies concerned should be advised to planaccordingly.J BTreasury Chambers26 March 19793CONFIDENTIAL
annex aIn respect of pay, the cash limits will be set in accordance withthe policy stated in Cmnd 7293, together with the  3.50 underpinning -subsequently announced.      The Government will review each case assettlements are reached.      Certain adjustments may be necessary, butfor Central Government expenditure on manpower the general principlewill be that a substantial proportion of any excess cost above theprovision already made will have to be absorbed within the existingcash limit.      Local authority settlements are covered by the cashlimits on Rate Support Grant.      It has been agreed that the cashlimits should be increased in respect of the Government&apos;s contributionto the offer made.to the manual workers.      Whether the Government makeany further contribution in respect of other settlements will dependon the circumstances of each case, but in no such circumstances willthe Government contribute more than their standard share of local,authority current expenditure.
