SECRETMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79)14 COPY NO20 February 1979CABINETCASH LIMITS AND PUBLIC EXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment1, We have so far agreed that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement(PSBR) must be kept at  8. 5 billion for next year. What is not clear is theimplications of this for cash limits.2. The issues discussed at last week&apos;s Cabinet (CM(79) 8th Conclusions,Minute 5) have arisen now because of our acceptance of the Select Committee&apos;proposals to unify the systems of estimates and cash limits.    I do notbelieve that we are in a position to do so in the present exceptionalcircumstances which were not foreseen when we took that decision.Moreover, it would, in my view, be politically unwise to rush into a decisionat this stage for the following reasons:a. The agreement on comparability we reached with the localauthority manuals&apos; unions contained an undertaking that theGovernment would finance its share of any subsequent paymentthrough Rate Support Grant.    To announce public expenditure cutswould be hard to reconcile publicly with this agreement whether thecuts fell in local government or elsewhere and could damage ourrelationship with the trade unions just when we have reached a widerunderstanding with them.b. Nothing could do more to undermine our chances of gettinga pay round substantially below 15 per cent than to be seen publiclyto take action which assumes the very outcome we are seeking toavoid.c. Though we have agreed to pay our share of the local authoritymanuals&apos; settlement we must make it clear that there will be noautomatic revision of cash limits to accommodate any furthersettlements which are made.1SECRET
SECRET3. The Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals need much more carefulconsideration.    They must be reasonably fair and credible if they are toact as a threat under c. above.    Can we really apply the same formula toservices where a cut can be made without great damage and to services whereit clearly cannot?   Is it sensible to apply the full rigour of economy to smallexcesses and no economy at all in excess of 2 per cent to settlements whichare clearly outrageous?    Could we really stick to such a policy when thecrunch comes?4. For these reasons I believe that we would be wrong to rush into anydecisions.    In a few weeks&apos; time we should have a clearer idea whether ornot we have succeeded in checking the escalation of settlements. Thesituation in 1979 is still uncertain.    But it is certainly not the same as in1974 when public sector settlements far outstripped those in the privatesector and drove the PSBR up far beyond our expectations.    The last thingwe want to do at a time when the heat is going out of the economy is to makemajor adjustments which result once again in a PSBR far below what we hadexpected.5. Thus I propose:-i. th^t we postpone our decision until nearer Budget time whenwe will be in a better position to decide how large an adjustment weneed to make.ii. That we then discuss how the quantum should be distributedbetween cuts in public expenditure and higher taxation (such as afurther national insurance surcharge, an increased rate of ValueAdded Tax and higher taxes on such goods as drink, tobacco andpetrol) and higher charges made by the nationalised industries; andiii. that we review the whole of our public expenditure programmeto see where cuts can be made which are least damaging to our mainsocial and economic objectives and are sensitive to the politicalrequirements of an election year.P SDepartment of the Environment20 February 19792SECRET
