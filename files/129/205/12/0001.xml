CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79)12 COPY NO20 February 1979CABINETSPECIAL EMPLOYMENT MEASURES 1979-80Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment1. Following our decisions on some of the special employment measureson 15 February (CM(79) 8th Conclusions, Minute 6) I thought it would behelpful to take stock of the position reached in relation to the  200 millionprovided for the measures in 1979-80 and to set out my proposals onexpanding the Job Release Scheme (JRS) and Small Firms EmploymentSubsidy (SFES) on which decisions are still required.2. Cabinet agreed at the meeting on 17 October (CM(78) 35th ConclusionsMinute 3) to expenditure on a statutory short-time working scheme or onalternative measures of  200 million for 1979-80 and that up to 230 million could be made available if suitable measures could be found toabsorb this sum.    It was decided by the Ministerial Group on Unemploymentamong Young People (GEN 27) on 24 October that the SFES should beexpanded from 1 January 1979 and should operate until 31 March 1980. Thisinvolved a cost of  61 million in 1979-80 to be charged against the 200 million, leaving  139 million for other measures.3. Cabinet agreed on 15 February that the Manpower ServiceCommission^ (MSG) programmes for young people and the long-termunemployed should be expanded in 1979-80 as GEN 27 proposed.    The extracost in 1979-80 of  32 million can be found within the existing provision forthe MSC and Department of Employment, as shown in the Annex to the reportfrom GEN 27 (CP(79) 1).    In addition, it was agreed that the TemporaryEmployment Subsidy should be replaced on 1 April by the short-time workingand restructuring assistance schemes, and that the existing JRS schemeshould continue.    The cost of implementing these decisions is  100 millioninI979.8O and this is chargeable against the  200 million.    So far, therefor*e have committed  161 million of the  200 million available for 1979-80,leaving  39 million for any expansion of the JRS and SFES.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4,       The issues remaining to be settled by the Cabinet are:-i. GEN 27 agreed that the JRS should be expanded by loweringthe age of eligibility but were divided on whether the new ages shouldbe 62 for men/59 for women, 63/58 or 63/59 (at present they are64/59).    The costs of these options are in an annex.    My ownpreference is for 62 (60 for disabled men)/59 which would cost 40 million in 1979-80 but raise the impact of this scheme on theunemployment register by 42, 000 to 66, 000. I would be contentwith 63/58 if the Cabinet were to think it preferable to extend thescheme equally for men and women.ii. The present one-year allowance was made tax-free in theFinance Act 1977.    It is, therefore, treated like unemployment,supplementary and sickness benefits and like the invalidity allowance.If (see 4. i. above) the allowance is paid for 2 (or 3) years the questionarises whether it should be taxed like retirement pensions. Unlikeretirement pension the JRS allowance would have to be taxed at source.GEN 27 did not reach agreement on the question of taxability.    My ownview is that taxing the allowance (and at source) would seriously reducethe attractiveness of the scheme and, for that reason alone, I wouldfavour legislation (not necessarily in the Finance Bill) to make a 2 (or3) year allowance tax-free.iii. GEN 27 agreed that the SFES subsidy which was fixed at 20 in July 1977 should be raised to  25 from 1 April.    This has yetto be endorsed by the Cabinet.    The change would increase theimpact of the scheme on the unemployment register by an estimated5, 000 and would cost  18 million in 1979-80.    If the Cabinet decidesto expand the JRS scheme (see 4.i. above), I am ready to forgo thisimprovement in order not to exceed the  200 million we haveprovided for the measures.iv.        The SFES applies at present to non-manufacturing industryin the development and inner city partnership areas.    An issue leftunsettled by GEN 27 was whether or not to extend this coverage tothe intermediate areas.    This would remove a further 9, 500 fromthe register at a cost of  28 million in 1979-80, and to my mind is notso desirable as uprating the sbusidy.    Its cost could not beaccommodated in the  200 million in addition to the JRS expansion,which is far superior in cost effectiveness and speed of impact.*       I have thought that, in present circumstances, it is undesirable to&amp;ve too much prominence in public statements to our proposals fore3cpenditure on employment measures in 1979-80.    I am first for oralquestions on Tuesday 20 February and questions already down will provide^e with the opportunity of making low key announcements of our decisions soI will announce whatever we may decide further about the JRS andSFESm a similar way.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRECOMMENDATION6.        The Cabinet is invited to consider the issues described inparagraph 4 above.    I recommend that in addition to the decisions reachedon 15 February we should expand the Job Rel ease Scheme on 1 April byreducing the age of eligibility for men to 62 (60 for disabled men) andlegislate to keep the allowance tax-free.    As acceptance of thisrecommendation by the Cabinet would bring the cost of our decisions in1979-80 to  201 million I would not, in that event, recommend any furtherchanges in the Small Firms Employment Subsidy.A E BDepartment of Employment20 February 19793CONFIDENTIAL

The costs of running the scheme as presently applied towomen aged 59 and men aged 6k will be  24 million in 1979/80 and  20 million in I98O/8I.2.   Under each option it is assumed that disabled men would beeligible at age 60.    This gives rise to extra costs in1983/8^ and 1984/85 but they are negligible. .
