SECRETHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCP(79) 2420 March 1979CIVIL SERVICE PAY RESEARCHNote by the Lord Privy Seal1. By way of background to the memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Prices and Corsumer Protection (CP(79) 25) the Cabinet may find thefollowing factual summary useful.THE PAY RESEARCH UNIT2. The task of the Pay Research Unit (PRU) is tc establish the factsabout outside pay and conditions for similar work based on detailed jobfor job comparisons.    It does not make recommendations about CivilService p^ay.    The PRU is independent of the Government.    The Directoris appointed by the Prime Minister and the Unit is overseen by the PayResearch Unit Board (PRUB) chaired by Lord Shepherd.    The Board willbe publishing their report on the Unit&apos;s work at about the due date of thepay settlement (1 April).    I understand that the report will endorse theUnit&apos;s findings.CHANGES MADE TO PAY RESEARCH IN 19773. Following a searching review by the Ministerial Group on CivilService Pay Research (GEN 64) a number of changes were made to the payresearch system, after negotiation with the unions, as the price for itsrestoration for the April 1979 settlement:-a. Introduction of greater independent element: establishmentof the PRUB;  appointment of Unit staff from outside the CivilService.b. Greater openness: publication of the PRUB report.c. Widening of fields of outside organisations surveyed:immediate 30 per cent increase in the size of the fields includingsmall and medium sized undertakings;  responsibility forchoosing fields placed firmly on the Director of the PRU.1COPY NO qCABINETSECRET
SECRETPAY RESEARCH PROCESSES4. The PRU makes detailed job for job comparisons. Beforereporting what they have found the PRU seeks the agreement of eachoutside organisation that the job comparisons have been fairly drawn.In the 1978-79 surveys all the comparisons have been agreed with theorganisations concerned.    The data produced by the PRU is processedjointly with the unions in accordance with the terms of the Civil ServicePay Agreement to produce an equivalent &quot;true money rate&quot; for eachoutside job.    Negotiation then centres on the median &quot;true money rate&quot;for each Civil Service grade.ADJUSTMENT FOR PENSIONS5. Virtually all public sector workers have inflation-proofed pensions:only in the non-industrial Civil Service is an explicit pay deduction madeto pay for this.    The deduction is a net figure:  it measures the differencebetween the level of all benefits (including inflation-proofing) inside andoutside the Service.    The evidence shows that outside pensions havereceived in recent years a greater degree of inflation-proofing than hadbeen assumed earlier;  other outside pension benefits (eg for death inservice) are often more generous than in the Civil Service.   The CivilService Pay Agreement specifies the use of the figure calculated by theindependent Government Actuary.    His report explaining his assumptionsand how he has arrived at his recommended deduction will be publishedat about the due date of the pay settlement (1 April).    Separate deductions,usually of the order of 5 per cent or 6 per cent, for pensions contributionsare made from the true money rates to reflect the fact that Civil Servicepensions are non-contributory.J$B SECURITY6. In the past the Official Side has used job security as an argumentin the final stage of the pay research negotiations.    It has been used tocounter arguments about eg the greater versatility and superiorqualifications of civil servants which the unions have advanced as reasonsfor paying more than the median rate indicated by the evidence,,   This yeara thorough survey of outside experience over the past 5 years by the PRUand a study of macro-economic statistics has failed to find any evidencethat on average civil servants have more secure jobs than other white-collar workers.    Some outside white-collar workers do have less securejobs and many have been made redundant:  but very many outside employershave suffered no redundancies at all.    Neither the Treasury nor theDepartment of Employment has been able to suggest alternative sourcesof evidence or ways of demonstrating that there is any measurable differencein relative job security.2SECRET
SECRETMOVEMENTS IN CIVIL SERVICE PAY7. The figures in Annex A show that by reference to movements inoutside pay indicators since 1975, Civil Service pay might reasonablybe expected to be at least 30 per cent behind.    In fact thv pay researchevidence suggests, on the stringent basis used for processing, anaverage increase of about 25 per cent.    The longer term picture showsCivil Service pay moving in line with or behind movements in outsideearnings.PCivil Service Department20 March 19793SECRET
INCREASES IN  CIVIL SERVICE PAY COMPARED WITH NATIONAL INDICESI    Changes since 1975The table below shows the movement in the pay of the non-industrialCivil Service since the last Pay Research settlement in 1975, inthe context of increases in various national indices,,	Percentage increase		1 April 1975 -1 April 1978	1 April 1975 -December 1978non-industrial Civil Service pay	26$	26$all non-manual workers&apos; earnings		not availableAverage earnings (all workers)	50$	62$ (provisional)Basic weekly wages	42$	61$(l)    earnings increased about \% more as a result of consolidatingthe phase 1 and 2 pay supplements.II    The longer term pictureComparable figures to show the increase in Civil Service and non-manual earnings on the same basis are not available.    The graphoverleaf shows movements since 1964 in the basic rates of pay forthe Administration Group in the context of national pay movementsas shown by the index of national non-manual earnings.* The extentto which Civil Service pay appears to lag behind pay rates outsideis of course affected by the starting year chosen.    1964 was thetime of the first pay research settlement after figures for thenational movement in non-manual earnings became available. Civilservants1   earnings may have increased more than basic pay over theperiod,  but although past data on civil servants&apos;   earnings is notavailable,  it is known that the difference is not sufficient toinvalidate the general picture of movements in non-industrial civilservants&apos;  pay generally keeping in step with pay movements outside.&quot;The male element only of this index has been used to avoid distortionsfrom the move to equal pay in outside industry over the period.(Equal pay already existed in the Civil Service in 1964).
