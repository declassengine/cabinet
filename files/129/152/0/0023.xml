INVESTMENT PROGRAMMES OF THE MINISTRY OF TECHNOLOGYNATIONALISED INDUSTRIESREPORT BY officials.      At their meeting on 28th September (CM(70)23rd) theCabinet invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultat-ion with the Minister of Technology, to arrange for officials to make recommendations, for consideration by the Cabinet on13th October, for a reduction of  50 million in 1974/75 in the investment programmes of the nationalised industries for whichthe Ministry of Technology was responsible*The nature of the programmes2      The investment programmes of the nationalised industries are a response to changing economic, commercial and industrialneeds as reflected primarily in the demand for their products.Demand can both rise and fall, thus affecting forward fore-casts of expenditureo   In accordance with the cabinet conclusions officials have concentrated on securing reduct-ions in demand on public sector resources by means of directreductions in capital expenditure programmes to the exclusionfor the present of other possible methods of obtaining thesame end, such as methods and quantity of finance, action on prices and costs and disposal of assets and activities.The starting point      The base line shows estimated expenditure by the fourMinistry of Technology industries in 1974/5 as  94-2 million.Since that report was prepared the British Steel Corporation(BSC) and the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) haverecosted their programmes to take account of latest tenderinformation not available when the base line was calculated.We recommend that this recosting, which involves no change inthe physical programme, should be taken into account beforereductions are applied.   This gives a starting point of 970 million in 1974/5*The reductions4      We have identified two specific reductions:-a       20 million off the gas industry&apos;s 1974/5 estimates.In the Gas Council&apos;s view this is the limit to which theindustry can go without endangering the natural gasprogramme, for which the industry are committed to buy the gas from the North Sea producers./b
b       30 million off the CEGB&apos;s 197V5 estimatesrepresenting a reduction in the winter plantmargin from 23% proposed by the CEGB and 20%reflected in the base line estimates to 17%.This will mean accepting a substantially increased risk of power shortages in the laterseventies.   The Electricity Council are nowreviewing the level of the plant margin and theMinistry of Technology reserve the right to reopen this question as a separate issue whenthe Council&apos;s report is received about the endof the year.5      The attached table shows the revised programmes.   Inthe earlier years adjustments have been made for CEGBexpenditure on conversions of coal fired power stations to oil or gas recently authorised by Ministers and for twourgent National Coal Board (NCB) coking projects showinga high rate of return.   It would, however, be unwise to count on the full savings shown in 1972/3 ( 36m) and 1973A( 57a)c   There are of course no commitments but furtherpower station conversions are likely to be authorised andthe NCB have plans for providing urgently needed plant for theblending of coking coal.The BSC programme     Apart from the recosting mentioned above two manorchanges in the BSC programme are in prospect:-i      An acceleration of stage I of the major projectat Scunthorpe.   This will increase expenditurein 1971/2 by up to  AO million most of whichwill be offset by reductions later in theperiod.ii      Additions to the programme, some in the form of extension and acceleration of existing projects,some to increase 1975 capacity from &quot;$2% million tons crude steel so far agreed to 35 million tons.Together, these could add  50-100 million a year to expenditure./7- 2 -
7      We recommend that the BSC1s total capital expenditurein 1971/2 should be limited to  185 million overall andthat the expansion of their programme under (ii) should be examined when formal proposals are received.   The Ministryof Technology reserve the right to reopen the 1971/2 limitas a separate issue when the next BSC corporate plan and investment programme are received about the turn of theyear.Consultation with the industries8      Before the public expenditure White Paper is publishedit will be desirable to tell the chairmen in strict confidence of the decisions affecting their industrieso   Itis also necessary to give the industries as soon as possiblefinal approval for the 1971/2 programmes and provisional approval for 1972/3*recommendations      We recommend that:-a      The estimated capital expenditure of the Ministryof Technology nationalised industries in 197V5 shouldbe reduced from  970 million to  920 million by the specific reductions in the gas and electricityprogrammes described in paragraph 4-.   The Ministry of technology reserve the right to reopen the questionof the CEGB plant margin when the Electricity council report about the end of the year.b      The chairmen should be told of the decisions ontheir programmes before the White Paper on public expenditure is published on 27th October-8th October 1970*x
