DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 government cp(70) 51 COPY NO w *24 September 1970CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE: EDUCATION, HEALTH AND WELFAREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. I have told the Chief Secretary that I can make savings on expenditure for which I am responsible which are reasonably commensurate with savings that will be made in England,,    In many instances - for example the proposed increases of charges in the National Health Service and for      ,school meals - it is inescapable that the arrangements for savings shouldbe the same throughout the country,,2,        Equally, if the standards of services are to be raised Jjb Englandthis will require an equivalent improvement in Scotland,PRIMARY SCHOOLS30        I have told the Chief Secretary that, like the Secretary of State for education and Science, I think it desirable to increase the provision for school building,,    The need to improve primary schools is no less urgentnorth than south of the border: indeed, there is a greater proportion ofover-large classes in Scotland.    The most effective way for me to make good our Election pledge of priority for primary schools is to provide theadditional classroom accommodation for the teachers we shall soon have available to reduce class sizes and at the same time to improve and replaceunsatisfactory old schools.    The additional amount of school building to be started in the period up to 1973-74 should be about  9 million (grossincluding land, furniture and fees), of which a small part might be found by diversion from further education building,GRADUATE TEACHER TRAINING4,        Earlier this year proposals had been formulated which were aimed at achieving a substantial improvement in the supply of secondary teachers in Scotland at a critical time relative to the raising of the school-leaving age.    I have asked the General Teaching Council for Scotland for theirviews on these proposals and I expect to have them by the end of next month.    Their implementation would require additional public expenditure
of rather less than  1 million in 1971-72 and about  1^ million in each subsequent year of the period up to 1974-75e    I ask my colleagues toagree to this additional expenditure^ which I cannot meet by making savingsother than those already offered to the Chief Secretary,HEALTH AND WELFARE services.        The situation in Scotland, as regards development of the health and welfare services, is similar to that in England,    Scotland would expect at least one-tenth of whatever figure is agreed for England,,G scottish Office SW123 September 19702
