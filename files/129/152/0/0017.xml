DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS government cp(70) 67 COPY NO     5429 September 1970CABINETRHODESIA; THE APPROACH TO MR, SMITH ANDOTHER PROBLEMSNote by the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary at their meeting on 18 September, the Ministerial Committee on rhodesia agreed that, subject to Cabinet approval, the following courses of action should be adopted in regard to initial contacts with Mr, Smithand to mitigating the ^ardeMp caused to certain people in this country resultingfrom particular aspects of British policy towards Rhodesia,    The proposalsfor this purpose were to lift the surcharge on certain Rhodesian postagestamps, and to provide relief for persons whose Rhode sian divorces wereinvalid.INITIAL CONTACTS WITH MR. SMITH2.     The Ministerial Committee considered that an approach to the regime through their representative in  South Africa would be the most convenient way of opening up contact; and that a letter to Mr. Smith in theterms of the attached draft at Annex A should be conveyed to him byHM Ambassador in South Africa.    Such an approach should not give rise to criticism in the United Nations or in the Commonwealth.    The last paragraph of the letter makes clear that while it could be made public thatinitial contact had been made, the substance of the letter should be keptstrictly confidential.3.     On timing, the Committee felt that it would be desirable to despatchthe letter a week or two before the debate in the first half of November onthe renewal of the powers on Rhodesia, so that it could be mentionedduring the debate that the first step to carry out the Governments commit-ment on Rhodesia had been taken.     The letter should not, however, besent too far in advance of the debate in case Mr, Smith replied in such away that no further exchanges were possible, unlikely though it may bethat he would slam the door so completely.1
&apos;.;.:..ri T&apos;MITIGATION OF HARDSHIP FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY(i)    Rhodes Ian Postage Stamps4.     In order to avoid conferring a measure of recognition on the illegal acts of the regime which would be contrary to Security council resolution No. 277 and would be likely to give rise to considerable domestic and international criticism, the Committee agreed that the preferable courseof action would be to maintain the illegality of the stamps, but to persuade the Post Office to procure and/or exercise a discretionary power to ceasesurcharging invalid Rhodesian stamps.    By this means the surchargecould be dropped without the need for legislation,i5. The Minister of Posts is discussing this question with the PostOffice and there is a good chance that his approach will be successful.If it is not, the alternative would be to make an Order-in-Council underthe Southern Rhodesia Act absolving the Post Office from the duty tosurcharge invalid Rhodesian stamps. If this becomes necessary, the ministerial Committee agreed that they would wish to consider further the terms of such an Order,6.     If the Post Office accept the course proposed it seems desirablethat we should make an appropriate announcement as soon as possible andin particular before the debate on the renewal of powers.    Although therewill be some criticism, the change can be defended on humanitariangrounds because the surcharge only affects individuals in this country andnot the regime.(ii)    Rhodesian Divorces7.     The Ministerial Committee considered that in the light of therecent judgment in the Adams divorce case the most urgent need was to mitigate hardship in cases of divorce.    They decided that the best way of doing this while avoiding the political difficulties of specifically validatingthe decisions of appointees of the illegal regime, which would be contraryto Security Council Resolution No. 277, would be by means of an Order-in -Council which would enlarge the jurisdiction of United Kingdom courts inthe matter of divorce to cover individuals with a Rhodesian domicile orthree years total residence in this country, in Rhodesia or in both countries.    A residential qualification in this country of 6 months would berequired to enable a Rhodesian resident to file a suit in a United Kingdomcourt, but subject to these qualifications the relief would be open to anyRhodesian divorced in the Rhodesian courts since the illegal declarationof independence (i. d. i. ) or having grounds for divorce.8.     This limited measure should not give rise to criticism at theUnited Nations and it could be defended on humanitarian grounds.    it therefore seems desirable to make the Order-in-Council on the lines of thedraft at Annex B as soon as practicable.    (This draft has been prepared by
officials but the precise text has not yet been settled so some draftingchanges may be needed.)    It would be subject to an affirmative resolution in the House and this could take place at the same time as the debate onthe renewal of powers Order.(iii)    Holders of Rhodesian Stock9.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer has drawn attention to a point which might arise from these two proposals for mitigating hardship for individuals in this country.    There will inevitably be increased pressure from other individuals who have also suffered hardship as a result ofHer Majesty&apos;s Governments Rhodesia policy.    The most prominent ofthese are likely to be the United Kingdom holders of Rhodesian Governmentstock.    They have received no payments of interest or capital since 1965and by the end of this year the amount owing to them will total approximately 34 million.     It will clearly be necessary to continue to resist this pressure, at least so long as there is little likelihood that a bond holdercould successfully sue Her Majesty&apos;s Government for an ears of interest.The announcement of the proposed measures of mitigation in (i) and (ii)above will lead to increased pressure from Jhe bond holders whenever itis made.    There is, therefore, no point in delaying these announcementsfor this reason.    But their presentation should take into account theposition of the bond holders and should avoid, as far as possible, prejudicingour vase for resisting their claim.CONCLUSION10.      I request the approval of my colleage&amp;tis to &amp;e three proposalsdescribed in this paper.A D-foreign and Commonwealth Office, SWT28 September 1970sea :
Annex AINITIAL CONTACT j WITH MR,  SMITHDMFT, LETTER FROM H. M. AMBASSADOR IN SOUTH africa to AIR VICE MARSHAL HAWKINSI am writing to you on the direct instructions ofSir Alec Douglas-Home about the possibility of negotiations between the British Government and Mr. Smith and his coll-eagues aimed at finding a settlement of our present differences,I do so? of course, without prejudice to the present constituencies-utional position.Mr. Smith will be aware that the Conservative Party when in opposition stated in respect of Rhodesia that &quot;We will makea further effort to find a sensible and just solution inaccordance with the Five -Principles which we have consistentlymaintained&quot;.In seeking to discharge this commitment Sir Alec Douglas-Home believes that it would be sensible, before either sidecommits itself to substantive negotiations with all the publicity this would attract, to seek to ascertain whether a realistic basis for such negotiations can be established.    Itis some time since he and Mr, Smith met to try and find a way through the difficulties which have faced Britain and Rhodesia.,It is still his strong desire to find a way out of the impasseand to reach a settlement honourable for both Rhodesia and Britain on which independence could be firmly based and widely accepted.   But since Sir Alec and Mr. Smith met there have been- 1 -
two public failures to agree and the task of finding a settle-merit has become that much more difficult.   In additionMr. Smith has adopted constitutional provisions with separatejelectoral rolls and having parity of European and Africanrepresentation in the Legislative Assembly as their ultimatepossibility.A central feature of the 1961 Rhodesian constitution wasthe proyision of common electoral rolls under which the Africanscould make steady progress to a point at some future date wherethe African majority could form the government of the country.No precise time scale was written into the constitution, but theprinciple of eventual majority rule was implicit in it.   this/as also the case in the negotiations on the Tiger and on theFearless.Sir Alec does not know whether Mr. Smith would be willingto     re-open negotiations on the lines which seemed to bringsuccess so near.   That is the first important point which he feels ought to be clarified.I am therefore instructed to ask whether Mr. Smith wouldconvey through Air Vice Marshal Hawkins his preliminaryreflections on Sir Alecf s approach to the possible resumptionof negotiations and in particular to the points of principle to which he attaches great importance.Sir Alec also wishes me to say that he thinks that since itis bound to become known that initial contacts are taking place it would be best not to try to conceal this fact.   But he feels,- 2 -
and he is sure that Mr. Smith will agree, that it will be essential to keep the substance of these exchanges entirelyconfidential.- 3 -
