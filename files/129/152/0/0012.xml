DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTYSS government cp(70) 62 COPY NO 5 425 September 1970CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  MINISTRY OF TECHNOLOGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Minister of Technology&apos;s proposals for reductions in hisDepartments expenditure are set out in CP(70) 52,    I am bound to saythat I cannot regard these proposals as adequately fulfilling the Cabinet&apos;intentions.and, of course, the reductions in this field are essential both toour wish to achieve a proper balance in the programme to be announced andto our ability to cut taxation,BEPARTMENTAL EXPENDITURE2,        The main points are thesea. aircraft the saving of  20 million to  25 million is put forward onlytentatively.    The Minister1 s paper does not make it clear whetherthis saving would be made if it were decided either to proceed withConcorde or to support the BAG 311^   Decisions on these two pointshave not yet been taken.    Unless, therefore, the Minister can assure us that  20 million to  25 million will be saved regardless of what is decided about these two major projects^ the proposal doesnot amount to a real saving at present,b. Research and development (R and D) for other departments the proposal that  5 million should be saved by transferringexpenditure to other Departments (paragraph 10) does not ofcourse make any contribution to our ability to cut taxes,c. Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59)The saving of  40 million on the 1958-59 is also unreal in the sense that the target we set for reducing public expenditure in July alreadyassumed that the Government would not introduce the legislation
which would be needed for the 1958-59 to spend  40 million in 1974-75.Thus when, in an earlier paper (CP(70) 20)0 we made the point thatthe programmes of the previous Administration would have involved an increase in taxation, that did not take account of the  40 million which might have been spent by the 1958-59 if the Labour Party had remained in power.    It may be of some presentational help forus to claim that we are not spending this money which our predecessors would in fact have spent, but the  40 millionmakes no contribution to our ability to cut taxes.d.      Other industrial and aircraft projectsThe list in paragraph 6 in the Ministers paper includes atthe end  10 million for &quot;industrial and aircraft projects notyet specified (but bound to come in four years)&quot;.    In my view,this item should be deleted, leaving the projects not yet specifiedto compete in due course for a share in the Contingency Reserveif they justify it.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES3. This is most important,,    I cannot accept the general approach inthe Minister !s paper that, in the present context, what is needed is toreduce &quot;the net requirement of public funds for the nationalised industries&quot;,I agree that, in principle, this is desirable.    However, it is not this whichgoverns our ability to reduce taxes, but the total demand which the nationalised industries make on resources.    What is required is thatthe contribution from the nationalised industries should consist of reductions in their investment programmes or the disposal of partsof their undertakings amounting to  50 million,4,        There is one further points the Ministers paper puts the totalof the investment programmes of the nationalised industries at a figure 70 million higher than when the operation to reduce public expenditurebegan; and this figure ignores the  25 million switch from hisDepartmental expenditure to which he refers in paragraph 19 ofhis paper,,    On this basis, even if the whole of the  50 millionsaving fell on capital expenditure programmes, we should stillbe  20 million behind our original starting point.A treasury Chambers SW125 September 1970
