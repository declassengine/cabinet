DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 65 COPY NO       ^23 September 1970CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BILL: CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment andProductivity1. In my memorandum CP(70) 63 of 25 September 1970 I undertook to circulate this further memorandum on points which I wish to bring to theattention of my colleagues.CONSPIRACY AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY ACT 1875 (paragraphs71-72)2.        Cabinet invited me to consider whether the criminal sanctions against employees under the 1875 Conspiracy and Protection of PropertyAct (as extended by the 1919 Electricity Supply Act) should be repealed oramended.3.        Section 4 of the 1875 Act and Section 31 of the Electricity Supply Actmake it a criminal offence for any person employed by a gas, electricityor water undertaking maliciously and wilfully to break his contract ofservice where he knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, that theprobable consequences of his doing so will be to deprive inhabitants inthe area concerned of gass water or electricity.    Section 5 of the 1875Act makes it a criminal offence for any person wilfully and maliciouslyto break his contract of service or of hiring, where he knows or hasreasonable cause to believe that the consequences of his doing so willbe to endanger human life or to cause serious bodily injury or to exposevaluable property to destruction or serious injury.4.        It will be noted that Section 5 is wider and more general in its application.    It is not restricted to public utilities; it applies to both parties to a contract of service and not merely to the employees it coverscontracts of hiring as well as contracts of service; and it establishes the test of endangering life and valuable property rather than simply deprivingpeople of a service.    Neither Section in terms applies only to trade disputesituations or to industrial action - though each covers the possibility of combined action in breach of contracts of employment as well as breachesby an individual employee acting on his own.
5. It would not, in my view, be desirable to repeal Section 5 of theAct;  the principle that anyone who deliberately and maliciously breakshis contract knowing that this will endanger life or cause serious injury or damage should be held criminally liable continues to be applicable.On the other hand, it is nowadays very difficult to justify singling outemployees in electricity, gas and water undertakings for specially severesanctions for breaking their contracts of service.    We have good reason,from recent experience, to know that strikes by a variety of other workerscan be just as serious (for example, hospital staff, sewerage workers anddockers),6.        I therefore favour the repeal of Section 4 of the 1875 Act (and thecorresponding provision in the Electricity Supply Act 1919) and the retentionof Section 5,    In any event, I would recommend that there is no good reason for retaining Section 4, since, apart from the considerationsmentioned in the previous paragraph, it seems to me that Section 5will in fact cover serious strikes in the public utilities,DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY EMPLOYERS (paragraphs 145-150)7,        My colleagues will note that the Consultative Document includesproposals concerning the disclosure of information by employersa, to their employees;  and b, to representatives of recognised unions with whom theynegotiate.In the first case I envisage that employers should be expected to discloseto their employees such information concerning the operations and activitiesof their undertakings as may be specified in regulations.    In the secondcase, I propose that the Code of Practice should guide employers on the disclosure of information in the course of negotiations with representativesof recognised trade unions.    This provision will be broadly similar inprinciple and scope to that in the previous Governments Bill though Ipropose a much simpler means of enforcement,APPLICATION TO THE CROWN8.        The Ministerial Committee agreed that it would be desirable in principle for the proposals to apply to the Crown, subject to detailed consideration of specific provisions and the exclusion of the armed forces and the police,PARAGRAPHS IN SQUARE BRACKETS9,        These have now been agreed and can stand, with minor amendments,
MANPOWER AND FINANCIAL ESTIMATES10.        The cost of my proposals will arise almost exclusively fromadditional manpower requirements, mainly as the consequence of theexpansion of existing and the creation of new agencies.    The best present estimates are as follows1975-761971-72   1972-73   1973-74   1974-75 .onwardsCost  0,3m    1.35m    1.90m    2.25m    2. 50mStaff 150 *433        ^433        *605        ^605*A11 staff not in post for the whole financial yearstaff in post for the whole financial yearPUBLICATION11,        With the agreement of my colleagues I propose to issue the consultative Document without delay,R department of Employment and Productivity SW128 September 1970\ \3
