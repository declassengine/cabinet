DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government assistance FOR THE FAMILIES OF LOWWAGE EARNERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesTwo powerful considerations make it essential that we should provide additional help for poor families with children.    There is in thefirst place our commitments to tackle the problem of child poverty.    Inaddition we have to protect these families from the consequences of theproposed reductions in expenditure,2.     The Social Services Committee discussed this dual problem on25 September.    I explained that for technical reasons the obvious courseof increasing family allowances and limiting the cost by additional^lawback&apos; was not as we had hoped practicable.3. The Committee considered however that the Family income supplement scheme (FIS) described below offered a sensible alternative method of getting help to these families, though our discussion threw upone point of doubt (see paragraph 11). We also discussed proposals for modifying the low-income remissions for school meal and other chargesthat will be going up.4.     Although we could not in the short time available put forward firmrecommendations I think it is important that my other Cabinet colleagues should know what progress we have made and that we should at this stageallocate a definite sum to provide relief for these families.THE FIS SCHEME5.     The scheme is designed to give measure of help to the poorestfamilies with children where the breadwinner is in full-time work(i. e. there is no entitlement to supplementary benefits).    Payments wouldbe made to families whose income falls short of an amount (the &apos;make-uplevel&apos;) which would vary according to the number of children as follows:-CP(70) 59COPY NO28 September 1970CABINET1 child2 children3 children  15 per week 17 per week 19 per week1
and so on in  2 steps.    These levels approximate to the present taxthresholds, and also to supplementary benefit levels assuming averagerents.    The payment would be 50 per cent of the shortfall, subject to amaximum of  3 per week.    Thus, a 3-child family with an income(including family allowances) of  15 per week would receive  2 per week.6.     Supplementary Benefit scales represent no more than a minimumacceptable living standard and we agreed    that households with incomeseven up to  4 par week above this level are in many cases very hardpressed.7.     Awards would normally be made for 6 months at a time, basedon the income over the 5 weeks preceding the claim.    The scheme wouldbe administered through the offices of the Department of Health and social Security, and it is envisaged that claims would be decided by the supplementary Benefits Commission, with a right of appeal to anindependent appeal tribunal.8.     It is clearly essential that the scheme should start at the earliestpossible date.    There is provision in the current legislative programme for a &quot;main programme&quot; Bill on family allowances, which a Bill forthis purpose would replace.    Provided we get the legislation on thestatute book by Christmas, we would hope to be able to invite claims fromnext April and start payments at the beginning of August.9.     On the basis of the Family Expenditure Survey we estimate that,as at April 1970, approximately 210,000 families were in the paragraph 5group, and that, assuming 75 per cent take-up the cost in a full year would have been about  8.5 million (this includes  1 million for an adjustment to Supplementary Benefit in &apos;wage-stop&apos; cases).    Some5-600 extra staff would, on this basis, be required for the take-on period,(April-August) and some 200 thereafter.10.     On the same basis (i. e. April 1970 earnings levels) it is estimatedthat to cover the group referred to in paragraph 6 would have brought in about another 300, 000 families at an extra cost (on the same assumptionas to take-up) in the region of  10 million per annum,ii.11.     If we are to have any prospect of starting the schema next year,the numbers I have given in paragraph 9 must be regarded as the limit.In discussion in the SL Committee, however, it was pointed out that the anticipated increase in earnings between April J970 and August 1971will mean that substantially fewer people will be in this income group butthat higher prices will largely carry the need up into the paragraph 6bracket.     It was suggested therefore that the make-up levels should beraised to allow for this.    The matter is, however, not a simple one.    if for example this meant that we should be taking the levels substantially above the tax thresholds, the combination of tax and the 5 0 per cent taperof the scheme might produce a marginal tax rate c  as much as 82 per cent,which could be represented as a serious disincentive, though at this level2
of income the   combined effects of tax and benefits in cash and kind are probably rarely understood.    Moreover we now have to consider whetherthe paragraph 6 group will have moved up the income - though notnecessarily to the same extent the real income - ladder,    K not thenumber will be too large to take onboard by August 1971.    Further,we shall have to give Parliament some explanation of the levels chosen,and if this involves disclosing our estimates of the movement of earningsit could, I suppose, be embarrassing.12.    Clearly, therefore, we shall have to give further consideration tothe levels and numbers, and I have asked officials of the Departmentsconcerned to do this as a matter of urgency.    However, in view of the timetable it is essential to get ahead with preparations for the scheme,including particularly the drafting of a Bill for introduction as soon as parliament returns.    For this reason I would like to have my colleagues1agreement to the scheme in principle, subject to the further consideration have suggested sted.INCREASED CHARGES13,    The average weekly impact over the year of the proposals for school meals and welfare milk would be in the following range (depending on the childrenrs ages);-2 adultswith one child 2s. 6d to 3s. 6d,with two children 5s. to 7s.with three children 7s. to 9s, 6d.with four children 7s. to 1.2s.In the case of school meals the impact would be concentrated in the weekswhen the child is at school.   In addition there would be increased charges for prescriptions and optical and dental services but the effect of these ona family would not be spread evenly over the year and while negligible insome cases it could be quite high in others.    It does not seem necessaryto take account of the withdrawal of free milk from junior schools in thatfew families are likely to buy more milk as a result of this.     On theother hand, the withdrawal of agricultural subsidies might raise food costsby some 2s. to 3s. a week for a family of three children and an income of 20 to  25 a weekf but not before next September at the earliest.    In thehousing field new proposals for housing finance and for an improved rent rebate system will be ready shortly but will not affect housing costsbefore April 1972 at the earliest,    Meantime rents are likely to rise inaccordance with previous trends j but this will not be a consequence of thecurrent proposals; the effects will be mitigated for a large proportion of council house tenants by the existing (discretionary) rent rebate schemes.3
14.    It is estimated that at present income levels something like10 per cent of households will be unaffected by the proposed increasesprovided that they take up their existing entitlement to exemption orremission,    A smaller number of households - about half a million -might be caught by some, but not all of the increases.    About 13 millionhouseholds, of which some b\ million are families with children, wouldbe liable to pay the increased charges in full.    This last group covers a wide range of incomes from very high to very modest ones.    Theincreased charges are likely to be hardest on families with incomes justabove the exemption limit,15.    My proposals for FIS have already besn drawn to take account ofthe increased food costs mentioned above but the scheme in its present form falls short of the upper limit of the present remission scales forthe benefits affected by our proposals and would not therefore helpfamilies in that range of income, or, indeed, just above it.    The social services Committee have considered whether some alteration in there mission levels should be made to soften the impact of the increased charges and withdrawal of the subsidy for welfare milk but thought thatthe possibility should be examined of further extending the ambit of theFIS to cover this level of income.    There may, however, be very substantial difficulty in th?s for the reason given at the beginning ofparagraph 11 above.CONCLUSION16.     These are problems of some intricacy and it would be desirableto re-examine them in the Social Services Committee before puttingfinal proposals to the Cabinet.    I am not yet able to offer firm estimates.To allow us to proceed with our main exercise I suggest therefore thatwe proceed on the basis that  20 million in all (including the 8,5 million originally estimated as the cost of the FIS scheme to help towards which I have already offered savings of about  4.5 million)should be set aside for the two purposes I have described, the preciseallocation of such expenditure between remission arrangements and/orFIS being left for determination in the light of further consideration.K department of Health and Social Security, SE128th September 197 04
