(confidential)THIS D0Cu7.I2NT.r3 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEHN5SENTcp(70) 702 October 1970CABINETMEASURES TO KELP THE POORER FAMILIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesCOPY NO1.     The Social Services Committee have been examining means to provide additional help for poor families with children.    We are committed to anearly move to tackle the problem of child poverty and in addition we need to protect these families from the consequences to them of the increased charges and the reduction of the welfare milk subsidy upon which we haveagreed.THE FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT (FIS)2.     The. possibility has been explored of increasing family allowances (PAM)using the device cf &quot;clawback&quot; to restrict the net benefit of the increase to the lower-paid.     But with the present tax position there would be room for no more than a five- shillings increase per FAM child.     Nor could onehelp the one-child family by this means.      The only alternative immediatelyis some form of means-tested benefit and a scheme of this sort is set out inthe Annex to this memorandum.      The poorest families with children, wherethe breadwinner is in full-time work, would be paid 50 per cent of thedifference between their normal incomes and an amount related very broadlyto the current tax threshold and to supplementary benefit levels for thecoming November (assuming average rents for a family of that size) subject toa maximum payment of  3 per week.     The &quot;make-up level&quot; would vary accordingto the number of children:   it would be  15 per week for a family of one child, 17 per week for one with 2 children and would progress in  2 steps so that a3-child family with an income (including family allowances) of  15 per week would receive  2 weekly.     This scheme would be administered through the offices of the Department of Health and Social Security and provided thenecessary legislation could be through by Christmas I should hope to be ableto start payments at the beginning of next August.1(confidential)
(confidential)3.     On the &quot;basis of the Family Expenditure Survey it is estimated that asat April 1970 approximately 210,000 families would have been eligible for thisbenefit and assuming a 75 Per cent take-up the scheme would cost in a full year about  8.5 million, and would involve 500 to 600 extra staff for thetake-on period (April to August 1971) and some 200 thereafter^      This estimateof cost includes  1 million for an adjustment to Supplementary Benefit in&quot;wage stop&quot; cases which would help about 30,000 families in addition to those mentioned above.      Even so the scheme will be a relatively modest one whichwe would need to present as a first aid measure rather than our long-termsolution to the problem of poverty.     But even though it would raise very fewfamilies now below the supplementary benefit level up to that level it wouldgive some much needed assistance. .*4.     It has been pointed out that the rise in average earnings anticipatedbetween last April and next August would mean that the numbers eligible forthis benefit would in fact be greatly reduced by that time if the make-uplevels proposed remained unchanged and that inasmuch as increased earnings are accompanied by price rises the only way to ensure that the scheme retainsthe impact originally intended will be to make it payable at higher income levels.     It would seem best to deal with this problem by taking a power to vary the make-up levels by regulations and by giving an assurance that the levels will be reviewed in the first quarter of 1971 and if necessary higherlevels introduced before the scheme actually started.      This is, I understand,acceptable to the Treasury who would not however accept that poverty shouldbe redefined at a higher level in real terms except in relation to the supplementary Benefit scale.5.     There is provision in the current legislative programme for a &quot;main programme&quot; Bill on family allowances which a Bill for this purpose would replace.    V/e need to get ahead vri.th the drafting of a Bill for introductionas soon as Parliament returns and I am therefore seeking the Cabinet&apos;sendorsement of; the scheme as outlined with which the Social services committee have expressed their agreement.THE IMPACT OP INCREASED CHARGES6.     The average weekly impact over the year of the proposals for school meals and welfare milk would be in the following range -2(confidential)
(confidential)(depending on the children1s ages):-2 adultswith one child2s 6d to 3s 6dwith two children 5swith three children 7swith four children   7sto 7sto 9s 6dto 12sIn the case of school meals the impact would be concentrated in the weekswhen the child is at school.     In addition there would be increased charges for prescriptions and optical and dental services but the effect of these ona family would not be spread evenly over the year and while negligible in somecases it could be quite high in others (as much as  1, or  2 in the case of dental treatment).     The withdrawal of school milk worth 1s 8d a week fromjunior schools represents a loss of real income but will probably not affectwhat families might regard as their disposable income in that few are likelyto buy more milk as a result.     On the other hand the withdrawal ofagricultural subsidies might raise food costs by some 2s to 3s a week for a family of three children and an income of  20 to  25 a week.     But this wouldnot be before September of next year at the earliest.7.    In the housing field new proposals for housing finance are shortly to be presented by the Housing Ministers and Cp(70): 64 mentions illustrative average annual rent increases of 10s and 15s a week towards the fair rent level.    but any such movement in rents would it is proposed be associated with a statutorysystem of rent; rebates for public sector tenants and of rent allowances for private tenants.    None of these proposals, moreover, would affect housingcosts before April 1972 at the earliest.     Meantime Council rents are likelyto rise in accordance with previous trends;   but this will not be a consequence of the current proposals and the effects will be mitigated for alarge proportion of Council house tenants by the existing (discretionary)rent rebate schemes.     The consequences of increased rail fares for the london area commuter services by 1973 are being examined.8.    Those families at present exempt from paying charges because their incomesare below the remission levels will of course be unaffected by the proposed increases providing they take up their existing entitlements to exemption orremission which automatically take account of any increase in charges.     Itis estimated that at present income levels something like 1-g- million families with children may be either wholly exempt in this way or might be caught by (confidential)
confidential)some, but not all, of the increases.     It is upon those who may be only partially exempt and the bottom range of those who would have to pay thecharges in full that anxiety must centre.     The extent to which the impact of the higher charges will be felt by families will of course vary accordingto the number and ages of the children but the increases are likely to fallhardest on families just above the present exemption limits:   in the case ofa 3-child family this could represent incomes (earnings * FAM) in the range of  22 to  24 a week.9.     The original proposals for FIS have already been somewhat improved totake account of the increased food costs mentioned above but the scheme fallswell short of the upper limit of the present remission scales for the benefitsaffected by the economy proposals and could not therefore be used to help the families who are just above that range of income.     To extend its ambit tocover these people would involve a large increase in the numbers eligible andtherefore in the cost of the scheme which it would, moreover, then be administratively impossible to introduce by August of next year.     To tackle the problem by income tax concessions would be an expensive method and couldnot entirely do the trick since there are some families in the vulnerable groupwe have had in mind (in the main those with older children) whose taxliability does not start until after the existing exemption limits for benefits are reached.     It seemed to the Social Services Committee best therefore to rely on some easement of the existing remission scales through tolerancemargins and it looks as though the necessary compensation for this group forthe increased charges for school meals, optical and dental services andprescriptions and for the withdrawal of the welfare milk subsidy could beachieved in this way at a cost of about  4 million.    This is based, however,on a very low take-up of health and welfare milk benefits by those eligibleon grounds of hardship and it would be desirable to leave some margin for theincreased take-up which we should try to secure.10.   The Social Services Committee were informed yesterday that the chancellor would be prepared to accept an increase of  17*5 million a year for the FISscheme (adjusted as necessary later in the light of earnings and pricesmovements) and for the various measures in mitigation cf hardship outlined above,4
(confidential)11.   I ask my colleagues -1.   to endorse the FIS scheme as set out in paragraphs 2-4 above;2.   to take note of the measures proposed in mitigation of hardshipat a cost (including that of the FIS scheme) of  17.5 million allowing for the final make-up levels of the FIS scheme and for an improvedtake-up of other means-tested benefits.K department of Health and Social Security SE12 October 19705
ANNEXFAMILY INCOME supplement the BASIS OF THE scheme.     It  is proposed to pay a benefit   (FIS)   equivalent   to one half  of  any amount by which the  income of  a family with children falls  short of  fixed make-up  levels,  subject  toa maximum of   3 a week and a minimum of  20p  (4s).    Theproposed levels are  shown  in column 5 of  table  1  below.They are broadly related to  the  tax thresholds  for families of  similar sizes.    The starting point   is  the tax thresholdfor a one-child family  (child under  ll)   rounded up  to  thenext pound.    Thereafter  the make-up  level   increases by 2 for each child in the  family.     It will be noted  that   foreach size of  family the make-up level  rises a littlehigher above  the  tax threshold for families with youngerchildren.    However,   the  larger  the family the greater  the likelihood that  some of   the children are over 11,  and  thusattracting higher tax reliefs   (the supplementary benefitentitlement  in  these cases  is also higher) .    For example,the  tax threshold for a 6-child family,  with 3 children under 11  and 3 aged 11   to l6  is   25 4s.    The practicaljustification for equal  steps of   2  is  the necessity tohave a  simple scale which can be expressed in a  legislativeformula.    Table 1  also shows  that  there  is  close agreementbetween  the  tax thresholds and  the  incomes, that corresponds to  the  supplementary benefit  levels  for  the  same families.MAKE-UP LEVELS2.    The broad effect  therefore will be  to provide a benefit for families who are not paying  income  tax and whose resources(including any family allowances  they are  already receiving)are less than  their requirements as assessed by supplementary benefit  standards.    The  table  in this annex shows  the amounts of FIS that will be payable  to  families  of  various  sizes at various  income  levels,  while  the graph shows  the effect  ofthe payment  of FIS upon  the disposable  incomes of  three childf am i1i e s .   ,
THE 50 PER CENT TAPER3.    Paying less  than the full  amount  of  the deficit belowthe make-up  level  ensures  that  there   is a real  incentivefor people who draw the  supplement  to increase  their earnings.    The benefit  in effect  tapers  to nil  at   the make-uplevel  -  that   is,  broadly speaking at   the  tax threshold.Thus,  as a man1s  income  increases  the amount he  loses,  atfirst because  the benefit  is  reduced and later because hebegins  to pay  income  tax,   is  fairly constant.    Ideally thetaper should be  the  same as  the tax rate  -  roughly 32 per cent.But  recent  research has  shown  that  families with children and incomes below the  tax thresholds are  grouped fairly closelybelow them.  A taper of  less than 50 per cent,  producing a benefit of  less  than  1   for families   2 below the make-uplevels,  would reduce  the benefit payable under the  schemeto  such an extent as  to make  it doubtful whether  the  schemewas worth having.    Even 50  per cent will  doubtless be criticised as mean.FULL TIME WORK CONDITION4.    Claims would only be accepted from families where  thebreadwinner    is  in full   time work.    Supplementary benefit   is available for  families where  the breadwinner is not  in fulltime work if   their resources are  insufficient  for their needs.As a matter of administrative  convenience,  however,family income  supplements would normally be awarded for a periodof  six months,  and once awarded would continue  to be paiduntil   the period was complete   (see paragraph  12 below).Any supplementary benefit becoming payable  to a family whowere drawing family income  supplement would of course be correspondingly reduced.     It   is not,   however,  proposed thatthis  should apply to national   insurance benefit,  which doesnot, in general,   take account  of  the family&apos;s  resources.2
THE WAGE-STOP5.    The new benefit will  increase  the  incomes of  families whoare  living below  the  supplementary benefit  level while  thebreadwinner  is earning,  and thus  reduce  the need to  &quot;wage-stop&quot;his benefit when his earnings are  interrupted.     It   is propoaedthat  those who are drawing  supplementary benefit but wage-stopped when  the benefit  is  introduced should have  theirbenefit   increased by the equivalent of  any FIS for whichthey would have qualified if  they had been at work.PAYMENT TO FATHER OR MOTHER6.     It  is proposed that FIS,   like family allowances,   should normally belong  to  the mother,   though capable of being drawn by either parent.    In the normal  case,  however,   itwill be necessary for the claim to be made by the  father(or  jointly by both parents)  and  it will also be necessaryto ensure  that  overpayments can be  recovered from either.INCOME TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT7.    Entitlement would be based on  the normal  income  of  the family.    All actual   income would be  taken into account  infull,  but  capital   (as distinct  from any  income derived from it)  would be disregarded.    The normal   income would  in generalbe assessed by reference  to  the period of 5 weeks preceding the claim,  but  there would be power  to  take  into account  a longer or shorter period if necessary to get a  truer estimateof  the normal  situation  (see paragraph  ll).    The family wouldbe considered on the  &quot;household&quot; basis,   as for  supplementary benefit,   rather than in the more  technical FAM sense.    Thusan unmarried couple  living as man and wife would be  treatedas  in the  same family;    a separated married couple would not.Supplementary benefit principles would also in general befollowed as  to  the children to be  treated as dependent.
ONE-PARENT FAMILIES8.      It  is proposed that   the scheme should apply to one-parent families  in  the  same way as  to normal  families.    Since  thereis already a  substantial  benefit  for widows with dependent children whether or not   they are  in employment  few of  them willqualify for FIS.    The position of divorced and single womenwith dependent  children,  who are treated  identically for  incometax purposes, provides  the best basis for consideration of  themake-up  levels for one-parent  families.    Table 2  shows  the  taxthresholds  for a divorced woman with dependent children and  the earnings  that would provide her with the  same disposable  incomethat   she would enjoy if  she drew supplementary benefits,assuming that  she took full  advantage of   the rule which permitsher  to  earn up  to  2 a week from part  time work before any reduction is made  in the benefit0    It will  be seen from a comparison of Tables  1  and 2  that  the  tax thresholds  are  in most cases  1  lower  than in the case of   two-parent  families.     Inview of   this relatively small  difference  it  is proposed  thatthe make-up  levels  should be the same for  one-parent  families as for normal  families.    This  is  in line with the practice  inrent rebate  schemes,  and a good case can be made out  on general grounds  for the somewhat more  generous  treatment  of  one-parent families  thereby implied.    There would also be a gain insimplicity.     It   is unlikely  that  to have make-up  levelssomewhat above the  tax thresholds for  these families willsubstantially increase the numbers of women who qualify for FIS;but of  those who do, more will  qualify for  the maximum benefitof  3.9.    Maintenance payments,  whether made voluntarily or underCourt Order,  would of  course be treated as  income.     It  is4
proposed  to take powers  similar to  those  in the supplementary-benefits  scheme to enable  the Department  to recover benefitpaid to a woman from a man who  is  liable  to maintain heror her children;    but  it is  envisaged  that  in practice,because  of   the relatively small  sums  involved  in FIS andthe considerable administrative cost of  &quot;liable relative&quot; act the powers would be used sparingly - normally only where such action was  in any case being  taken against a man onaccount of  supplementary benefit.10.      Widowers and other men bringing up children on  theirown would be  treated  in the  same way as unsupported mothers.When they are wholly dependent  on low earnings  these menat present  face serious difficulties.    There  is no national insurance benefit  for widowers and very few separated ordivorced husbands can  look for any contribution by way ofmaintenance  from an absent wife.
ADMINISTRATION(a) ASfcfEbSMJbJNT11.      The possibility of  annual  assessment,  using  the tax year,has obvious attractions.    Unfortunately investigation suggeststhat   it would be wasteful  and  inefficient.     It would  involveobtaining and checking  Information about  earnings  and otherincome  in 52 weeks  that might  include a large number of  casualengagements with different  employers   (the form issued to PAYEtaxpayers at  the end of  the year does  not provide  the  informationneeded).     It would be an uneconomic use of   staff  to deal with allapplications and renewals at  the same time each year,  and therewould be very difficult problems about mid-year claims.     It  isproposed  that  claims  should be accepted at  any time.    A recentstudy of  assessment machinery for  income-related benefitsindicated  that  in most  cases  evidence of  earnings over  the five weeks before the claim is  sufficient,  though power  is needed  to base the assessment on longer periods   (eg as regards  seasonal workers)  or shorter ones   (eg where a man returns  to work after along  illness).    The object would be to establish the normalincome and the normal  structure of  the  family.(b) PAYMhJNT12.      For economic administration it  is important  that   thepayment, once fixed,  should not be altered until  it comes up forrenewal.    This is also justifiable on the basis that entitlementIs  determined by the  income in the period preceding the claim.But  this  position could not be held  for as   long as a year.Experience with similar benefits  suggests  that  six months  is  aboutright  for  this purpose-e,  though there should be power to makeshorter awards where for instance a man has been at work for a
very short  time,  or  longer ones where  it  is  clear that   theposition is unlikely  to change.    At  the start  of  the scheme thelength of awards will have to be staggered so as to spread therenewals work.    The method of payment  is under examination, butthe legislation should give  the Department power to pay by different methods  in different  cases.    For example, weeklypayments as; low as; 4s would clearly be uneconomic.    There are good arguments  for making payments quarterly in advance  in caseswhere  the weekly payment would be  10s or  less   (many countries payfamily allowances on this basis).    The maximum quarterly payment would be  6  10s .(c)    ADJUDICATION13.      The main adjudication problem will  be arriving at  a broadassessment  of normal  income from evidence that will often be fairly minimal.    This  is not  a suitable task for the hierarchyof  statutory authorities which determines  claims  for national insurance benefit and FAM, whose  function is rather  the preciseinterpretation of  complex legal provisions  in accordance withdetailed case-law.    Both simplicity and flexibility - inparticular a wide power  to revise decisions  - are clearly desirabl&apos;The obvious body to determine entitlement  is the supplementary benefits Commission and  I would propose  to ask. the Commission toundertake  this  job.    Their function would be a statutory one, butthey would have no other responsibility for the scheme apart  fromadjudication on claims.    There would be a right of appeal  in allcases  to an independent  tribunal.    For the latter purpose,  the tribunals which now hear supplementary benefit  appeals would bethe most suitable;    they already deal with certain matters outsidethe supplementary benefits scheme.7
NUMBER AND COSTS14.    It  is estimated  that  at April  1970   there were  in the region of  150,000  standard families,   or motherless  families,with earned  incomes   (including any family allowances  and anyearnings  of   the wife)  below the proposed make-up  levels.At  the same  date  it  is  estimated that   the number of  fatherlessfamilies  with  the mother in full-time work and incomes belowthe tax threshold for standard families may have been in the region of 65,000.    On this basis the maximum cost  of  thescheme would be about   9.8m a year  ( 7.3m for  standard andmotherless families,  and  2.5m for fatherless  families).There would be extra Supplementary Benefits costs because  ofadditional  benefit payable  in wage-stopped cases  of  about lm a year.15.    These  figures,  however,  assume full  take-up.    All  experienceof means-tested benefits  suggests  that  take-up will  always fall short of   the numbers  thought  to be eligible and will  in anycase  take  time  to reach its full potential.    It  seems unlikely,therefore,   that  the  total  cost  in 1971/72  (assuming a start on1 August   -  see paragraph  17)  will exceed  4m.     In a full  year,assuming  75 per cent  take-up  (this  is comparable  to  theestimated take-up of  rate rebates and free school meals)   it might perhaps  rise  to  8.5m.STAFF COSTS16.    On  the assumption  in paragraph 15  the maximum eventualcase  load would be of  the order of  160,000.    A preliminarystaff costing suggests  that on this basis about 200  additional staff would be needed to run the scheme,  but  some 500  to 600may be needed temporarily for the  take-on period  (about  13weeks) .TIMING17,    Provided the necessary legislation receives  the royal assent by Christmas,  and the necessary staff can be madeavailable  it  is hoped  to pay the first benefits from 2 August  1971.At this  stage  it  is not,  however, possible to undertake a firm commitment to this target, which may in any&apos;case beaffected by other calls on the Department * s&apos;resources,
