PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment and ProductivityI have informed the Chief Secretary of a number of items ofadditional expenditure affecting DEP services between 1971-72 and1974-75 and as there has been no opportunity to consider these jointlyhe has suggested that I should circulate this paper.    I have also notifiedhim of savings which I have already identified for those years,    I now circulate for the consideration of my colleagues details of the additional expenditure for which I seek approval, together with a summary of the savings,A.    SAVINGS2.     My colleagues will wish to note that the savings I have so faridentified total  2. 66 million in 1971-72,  2. 87 million in 1972-73, 4. 25 million in 1973-74 and  5.17 million in 1974-75.3.     The main elements in the savings are?-a. Restriction of the rate of expansion of the Youth employment service to 5 per cent per acarsm of which about 3 a per cent isrequired to keep pace with the increasing number of youngpersons, the remainder to bring the Service up to certain minimum standards.b. Termination of the grant to the National Institute forHousecraft (Employment and Training) Limited.c. Deferring the setting up of Industrial Training Boards for shipping, Banking, Broadcasting and Port Labour.d. Phasing out grants paid to Industrial Training Boards foroff-the-job training and training of training officers, both ofwhich were pumperimers which have fulfilled their purpose.e. Reducing progressively the grant paid to the BritishProductivity Council so that no grant is payable after the endof 1972-73.1DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC0CP(70) 57 COPY NO25 September 1970CABINET
f.     Introducing as soon as practicable charges for GTCtraining of trainees sponsored by employers.The savings also include a reduction of over 900 in the Departments bidfor staff for 1971-72 and I should be able to secure this despite the staffincreases entailed in my proposals kolo&amp;  or additional expenditure.There will be a further saving of  34 million on DEP Vote in 1974-75 if our recommendation is accepted that Regional Employment Premium isdropped in September 1974.    These savings include reductions in AlliedService costs and, in the case of the Youth Employment Service, in LocalAuthority expenditure since the Service is 75 per cent grant-aided,25 per cent being met by the Authorities.4.     I am by no means content with the savings I have so far identified.I intend to review critically all my Departments functions to see wherechanged policies could bring further savings.    But this will take more time than is available for the present exercise.B,    ADDITIONAL EXPENDITUREINDUSTRIAL TRAINING5,     The largest item of additional expenditure is for industrial training.    We are pledged to stimulate a massive retraining programme and I have put in hand an urgent review of the whole training system.While it will be my objective to see that the major part of this retrainingis carried out within industry, the Governments own direct training programme will as far as I can see at the moment, have to make a mor significant contribution than it does now.6.     The Government Training Centre programme of the lastAdministration will by 1971-72 increase the number of training places to12, 000 compared with 3, 000 places in 1964.    It takes two years to bring a new GTC on stream, and we must now decide our programme form1972-73.7.     I recommend that we announce a 5-year programme beginning in1972-73 to provide an additional 5,000 training places, giving a potentialadditional throughput of 10-15, 000 trainees a year.    This would maintain a rate of expansion comparable with that achieved in 1964-70.    We shouldbe heavily criticised for anything less,8.     The total capital cost of this new programme over the full 5 years estimate at about   14 million but some provision has already been madefor expansion in the PESC forecasts.    The net additional capitalexpenditure up to 1974-75 is  4. 3 million of which  3. 3 million would beon MPBW Vote and   1 million would fall to the DEP Vote,    There wouldbe net additional rtinning costs rising from  0,1 million in 1972-73 to 2.1 million in 1974-75 and eventually reaching  6, 8 million when theprogramme is completed.2
9,     My second proposal for additional expenditure relates to retrainingdirected specifically at the unemployed.    Present GTC training to craftlevel is beyond the capabilities of the majority of the unemployed,particularly older men.    These men could be more readily absorbed, and could release others for upgrading to meet skill shortages, if they couldbe given simple forms of semi-skilled training.10,     My proposals fall into two parts,    First, the introduction of semi-skilled training courses in a number of existing GTCs, possiblyutilising also spare training capacity in firms, coupled with a modestexpansion of the existing training for the unemployed in white-collaroccupations at technical colleges.    Second, a training grant to employers in Development and Intermediate Areas who are prepared to take on andtrain workers aged 45 or over who have been unemployed for at least8 weeks.    The grant would be on the same lines as the existing government training grants for these areas, but would not be confinedas those grants are to incoming or expanding firms.11.     These proposals represent a modest start in a field where we arelagging badly behind other countries,    I estimate they might lead to training for up to 3,000 unemployed people, over and above existing schemes, in the first year of operation.    This sort of training may inthe end be carried out in a different way and on a larger scale and myreview will be covering this.    But we ought in my view to make a starton it at once and in the short run the method I propose seems the onlyone available.12,     I expect these schemes, depending on the response, to cost in payment of training grants some  0.4 million in 1971-72,  0.5 million in1972-73, reducing thereafter to  0. 28 million in 1974-75 when allowance is made for Appropriations -in-Aid from the National Insurance Fund.EMPLOYMENT MEDICAL ADVISORY SERVICE13,     I am under pressure to establish an Employment Medical advisory service on the lines provided for in our predecessors&apos; Safety and HealthBill.    We supported this part of the Bill when in Opposition.    The objectof the Service would be to provide expert medical advice on occupationalhealth hazards.    It would replace the out-of-date system of AppointedFactory Doctors which constitutes a gross waste of medical manpower.The proposal was supported by the Home Affairs Committee on 17 Julysubject to further consideration of the financial and manpower implications.14.     The cost of the Service would be   0. 8 million in a full year.    for reasons of timing I would not expect the total cost in 1971-72 to eaceed  0. 3 million.3
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BILL15.    We are giving priority to the new Industrial Relations Bill whichwill be introduced this session.    It will inevitably require staff, thecost of which on present estimates will rise from   0. 3 million in 1971-72to  2. 25 million in 1974-75,EMPLOYMENT SERVICE16.    We are pledged to help people seeking new and better jobs.    In my view an essential element in this is to improve the employment service sothat it ceases to be a service primarily for the unemployed but makes a real contribution to the effective deployment of the labour force.    To do this, the service requires better quality and better trained staff,specialising on employment work (particularly career guidance), and itwill need to be separated from the administration of unemploymentbenefit, and housed in better premises..    To some extent improvementscould be paid for by savings in the Service itself - eg by a drasticcontraction of the Local Office network.    Once the quality of the service is established, it may also be possible to introduce a measure of fee-charging.    I would further hope we could economise on the 10,000 staff at present engaged on paying out unemployment benefit,    I shall need more time to examine these possibilities.    But I do not think they could produce savings on a sufficient scale during the period under review topay for the kind of improvements that are badly needed.    I thereforeenvisage a programme of improvement entailing additional staff,accommodation and allied service costs rising from  0.53 million in1972-73 to  2. 26 million in 1974-75.CONCLUSION17.     The additional expenditure I am proposing would amount to 22. 09 million in total, composed of  1 million in 1971-72,  3. 68 million in 1972-73,  8, 32 million in 1973-74 and  9. 09 million in 1974-75.Against this, I have identified savings of  48. 95 million in total,composed of  2. 66 million in 1971-72,  2. 87 million in 1972-73, 4. 25 million in 1973-74 and  39.17 million in 1974-75 assuming thetermination of REP.    The savings apart from REP represent nearly3 per cent rising to over 5 per cent of the Department^ net forecastexpenditure,18.    I invite my colleagues.es to agree to the additional expenditure Ipropose, and to note the savings I have enumerated.    Details of both are set out in the Annex.R department of Employment and Productivity SW124 September 1970
