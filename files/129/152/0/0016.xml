THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP PER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S government cp(70) 66 COPT NO28 September 1970CABINETINVESTMENT INCENTIVESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer we are publicly committed by our Election Manifesto to end the system of investment grants which was introduced by the previous Government in 1966.Under this system grants of 20 per cent over the country generally andAO per cent in development areas are paid in respect of expenditure on new plant and machinery in manufacturing industry, and the extractive and construction Industries.   With certain exceptions - of which the steelindustry is the most important - the public sector is outside the scope ofthe scheme.   Expenditure on plant and machinery not qualifying for investment grants attracts an initial allowance of 30 per cent.   the investment grants currently cost the Exchequer a gross figure   of about 600 million a year.   The administration of the scheme costs, in addition,about  2 million a year and employs over 1000 civil servants in fiveregional offices.2.     To achieve our objectives, it is clearly desirable to move as quickly as possible; but the investment grant scheme cannot be brought to an endwithout some warning.   I have discussed this with the Minister of technology and we have come to conclusion that, despite the urgency, we should never-theless give a year&apos;s notice - that is, announce at the end of October thatno further grants will be paid in respect of expenditure incurred after31 October 1971.   As grant is paid a year in arrears, the reduction inGovernment expenditure would start to become effective a year after thatdate.Future Arrangements3*    We are all agreed that the country requires both a steadier and afaster rate of economic growth and there is no doubt that this requires that capital investment should be undertaken on a greater scale than wehave seen in recent years.   The most effective way of stimulating anadequate level of investment is of course to bring about circumstances inwhich industry can be assured of an expanding market and rising profits.1
1;-.     At present company profits are depressed.   They have been virtuallystagnant since 19&amp;5, the apparent recovery after 1 966 being mainly theeffect of stock appreciation, ^vhich has been unusually high as a result of devaluation and rising world commodity prices.   If this element is excluded,since it is automatically absorbed by the need to finance&apos;stocks at higher prices, the provisional 1969 figure for profits of industrial and commercialcompanies was the lowest, in real terms, since 1962.   While some recoverycan be expected, it is as yet too early to say whether profits rail riseby enough to allow for rising prices and a proper return on additions to thecapital stock.5.    The financial position of companies has also deteriorated in the last five years.   Liquid assets as a percentage of value added in the companysector (a measure which is independent of inflation and automatically allows for the need for extra cash to finance extra business) have fallen fromover 30 per cent in every year before 1 9^5 to about 27 per cent in the lasttwo years.6.     Industry is subject at the same time to ether financial constraints,namely the restrictions on bank lending and the high current levels ofinterest rates.   It is clear that these factors taken together must have serious implications even for the rate of investment which we have at themoment,   The United Kingdom&apos;s rate of investment per employee is alreadylow compared with that obtaining in other member countries of the OECD; andthe latest indications are that the volume of investment by manufacturing industry here will rise very little in 1 970 as compared with 1 969 and willactually decline in 197&quot;!.7*     I am strongly of the opinion, therefore, that if we are to avoid a further damaging reduction in company liquidity and hence in the rateof industrial investment, the Exchequer savings arising from the abolitionof investment grants must be largely returned to the companies sector,partly by a revised system of tax allowances on capital expenditure, andpartly by changes in the burden of corporate taxation.8.     I would not, however, propose to retain in this revised system the discrimination in the present investment grants scheme in favour2
of manufacturing industry against service industry.   There is no economicjustification for such discrimination.   However, my colleagues willrecognise that if the new system of allowances is to apply to manufacturing and service industries alike, it will necessarily follow that a manufacturingVI icompany will enjoy under my proposals a smaller, and a company in theservice industries a larger, &quot;incentive&quot; to investment than it gets atpresent.   This is an inevitable consequence of ending the existingdiscrimination without a very substantial increase in the overall cost.Tax Allowances9.    I have naturally considered a proposal made by the Confederation ofBritish Industry that we should move to a system of free depreciation,which would permit a firm towritc  off, for tax purposes, its capitalexpenditure in the first year (subject to the availability of profits) in thesame way as current expenditure.   This is an attractive idea, but over thenext five years this would cost the Exchequer even more than the existinginvestment grants scheme and if only for this reason I could not entertainthis idea at the present time.10.   However, it is common ground between the Government and industry that the desirable level of Investment is more likely to be achieved ifwe can improve the current provisions for depreciation.   Without goingas far as requested by the CBI, I consider that we can make a significantmove in this direction.   In order to provide investing companies with adequate liquidity to sustain investment 1 propose that for the country generally (i discuss the development areas separately below) we shouldimprove the rate of initial allowance (at present 30 per cent on plant and machinery which does not attract grants) and also improve) and simplify theannual writing down allowances - these, which are additional to the initialallowance, are at present 15 per cent, 20 per cent or 25 per cent accordingto the expected life of the asset.   These changes can most conveniently be combined in a new system of depreciation allowances for all expenditure incurred after 3&apos;1 October 1971 on plant and machinery (other than cars).I propose that the initial allowance should be combined with the annualallowance for the first year, and that a total of 60 per cent of theexpenditure should be written off for tax purposes in the first year and3WKBSBBBBSkb
25 per cent of the reducing balance in each subsequent year regardless ofthe expected life of the asset.   As compared with the present system of selective grants, initial allowances and multiple rates of annual allowances,this will be a simplification which will be welcomed by industry and commerce.Corporation Tax11.   I have in mind proposals in the field of corporation tax which I willexplain to my colleagues orally.Development Areas12.   We made it clear in our Election Manifesto that we should maintain an adequate degree of differential in favour of investment in the development areas.   This is desirable for economic as well as political reasons.13.   For this purpose I propose the following measures -a. Expenditure incurred after 3*1 October 1971, on immobile plant and machinery in the development areas, whether by manufacturing,construction and extractive industry or by a service industry, shouldattract free depreciation (ie should be allowed to be wholly written off for tax purposes in the first year).   For obvious reasons thisprivilege cannot be extended to mobile items such as lorries and othertransport equipment, though I am considering the special circumstancesof the construction industry (all of whose plant is on constructionsites and must in a sense be mobile, but some items of which may inpractice be less mobile than others).b. In the 1970 Budget the initial allowance for new industrial buildings and structures was raised to 40 per cent in the development and intermediate areas and 30 per cent elsewhere for a period of twoyears ending in April 1972.   I would propose to retain the 40 per centallowance for these areas indefinitely but to allow it to fall backin the other parts of the country after the two years to its earlierlevel of 15 per cent.   This should give a small but helpful continuingincentive to construction in the development and intermediate areas.4
14.   I think that these pr-posals for the development areas, honour ourManifesto commitment in which we said:    &quot;We will encourage investment throughtax allowances or reductions rather than by means of grant 7 j with differentialarrangements in favour of the development areas .,.&quot;   There are two quite different wa3*-s of looking at the regional differential.   One - and in my view the more relevant - is to consider the total cash flow to the development areas from the differential element in the tax allowance system.   Theexisting differential under the investment grants system is at presentcosting, before tax, about  105 million a year.   The differential outlined in paragraph 13 above will in terms of cash flow be at least as good as this - indeed better - for several years to come.   The other way of looking at the matter is to consider the effect upon profitability or cash recoveriesin respect of investment expenditure by an individual firm in a development area.   On this basis there will inevitably be a reduction of about two-thirds in the &quot;present value&quot; of the regional differential to a firm in manufacturing industry which now receives investment grants, mainly becausethe volume of assistance at present confined to manufacturing industry willin future be spread over the service sector as well and partly also because a scheme for free depreciation is loss favourable in terms of present value than a scheme of cash grants.   It does not follow,, of course, that the neteffect will be a reduction in the volume of investment undertaken in thedevelopment areas.15.   We also said in our Manifesto:    &quot;We will maintain financial incentivesfor investment in the development areas, making greater use of the powers given by the Local Employment Acts&quot;.   Since, as I have explained, we aremaintaining the overall cost of the regional differential over at least thefirst four or five years, I do not think that we should embark on major new forms of expenditure in the development areas.   But I recognise thatit may be possible to make improvements which will be helpful in practiceas well as presentationally, without great extra expenditure.   Inparticular I should be prepared to consider, as part of this package,5
proposals which bold promise of being cost-effective in the field of payments to employers under the local employment acts and for training in thedevelopment areas.   Officials have been studying the possibilities.Continuing vrorlc will, of course, be necessary on longer term questionsof development area policy.Tax simplification16.   The 60 per cent first-year allowance for plant and machinery generally,with a uniform rate of annual allowance thereafter and free depreciationfor development areas will represent a major simplification of the system of tax allowances for capital expenditure.   I propose one further reform inthis area.   The Home Secretary, when he was Chancellor, simplified thesystem of annual writing-down allowances by introducing the present threerates (&quot;15 per cent, 20 per cent and 25 per cent) for expenditure incurred after November 1962, instead of the multiplicity ofpreviously existing rates.   But some expenditure on pre-1962 plant and machinery is still being written off year by year at the old rates,and at fairly modest cost I now propose to level up these old rates to the corresponding post-1962 level.   The result will be that after thefirst year&apos;s allowance at 60 per cent all expenditure on plant and machinery incurred after 3&quot;l October 1971 which does&apos;not qualify for free depreciation will be written down at the 25 per cent rate; all earlierexpenditure will be written down at 15 per cent, 20 per cent or 25 per centas appropriate.   It would, of course, be eVen simpler if all such expenditure could be written down at 25 per cent whenever it was incurred, but thatwould be prohibitively costly;Shipping Industry17.   Shipping represents a special case.   At present new ships boughtby British companies qualify for investment grants of 20 per centplus free depreciation on the remaining 80 per cent of capitalexpenditure.   This represents a large differential over other industries and a substantial cost to the Exchoquor - tho present level of grant is about 100 million a yoar and is rising.   The Rochdale Committee of Inquiry into6
Shipping which reported in May 1970, recommended that the level ofspecial assistance should he continued for the present hut should bekept under review as regards the form of assistance.     They recommendedthat aa soon as practicable investment grants for ships should be with-drawn and replaced with investment allowances of equivalent value.These recommendations have been examined in detail by a working party of officials.18.   It seems clear that if investment grants are to be withdrawngenerally there is no justification for retaining them in the case ofships alone.     In addition, international criticism could be expectedif ships were to be singled out for the enjoyment of a grant scheme.Particularly important is the fact that ships (with hovercraft) arethe only assets which have enjoyed investment grants, etc. even though they operate outside the United Kingdom.     The result has been thepayment of large amounts of grant on ships bought abroad by British-registered companies, which have brought no benefit and in some casespositive detriment to the balance of payments.     It has proved verydifficult to remedy this damaging situation so long as ships getinvestment grants;   amending legislation has reduced but not eliminatedthe damage.19.   On the other hand, there appear to be good grounds for making the transitional arrangements for terminating the grants for ohipo more flexible than the simple 12 month notice proposed above.     The taxposition of shipping companies is such that most of them will be unablefully to benefit from increased tax allowances and I suggest that weshould allow capital expenditure incurred up to, say, one year longer than the standard transitional period (see paragraph 2) to qualify for grant in the case of ships for which contracts have been signed beforethe date of announcement.     It is administratively more feasible to relate the transitional arrangements to specifie contracts in the caseof ships than it is in the general run of cases^20.   The question of what arrangement should replace the grant for ships is more difficult.     Shipping is enjoying at present a considerable boom;freight rates are high, shipbuilders&apos; order books are full and the case for a high level of special assistance for the shipping industry does7
not seem well-founded.     The withdrawal of investment grants for ships will mean that free depreciation will become available on 100 per cent ofthe cost of a new ship;   nevertheless the change will have a pronouncedadverse effect on the cash flow of the shipping companies, many of whichare not in a position to offset this by additional tax allowances since they already have a large accumulated back-log of such allowances waiting to be set against future profits.     For this reason an investmentallowance - a form of assistance which in any case is open to the objection that it represents a subsidy as well a3 giving rise to awkwardproblems of administration - would be of little material assistance tothe shipping industry.     My strong inclination is to say that theindustry is not in need of substantial investment incentives, and that provided the transitional arrangements are fairly generous on the lines suggested in paragraph 19 above, we should withdraw the grants and not go further than to give the shipping industry free depreciation.    Thefigures in the table annexed make this assumption.Financial Effects21.   The financial effect of the proposals outlined in this paper can besummarised as follows.     There would be a transitional period during theremainder of the present financial year and in 1971/72 during which theintroduction of the tax changes which I have in mind would lead to a net loss of revenue to the Exchequer.     My intention here is in the short-term to help companies to meet the liquidity problem mentioned inparagraphs 3-5 above.     Thereafter the combined effect for Britishindustry as a whole of the combination of measures I propose,   would overa run of years, be to channel back to companies through the tax system the savings to be secured by withdrawing investment grants (excluding grants for nationalised industries and ships).    The figures are set out in the table annexed.     The overall effect, when allowance is ma.de for the with-drawal of grants from shipping, will be to secure net Exchequer savings of  100 million or noro a year from 1972-73 onwards.
SCwIVC 122.   The figures in the attached Table assume that industry as awhole (except shipping, to whose special position I referred inparagraph 19 above) will have sufficient profits to take full advantage of increased tax allowances.     Some individual firms, ofcourse, will not be in this situation, and to the extent that this is so the actual cost to the Exchequer of additional tax allowanceswill be smaller than the estimated figures.     Eor such firms the new system I propose in this paper will be of reduced value or even no value, and we must therefore be prepared for protests.     However,this result is inevitable in a decision to encourage investmentthrough tax allowances and link incentives to profitability.Other Industries23.   The implications of these proposals for various special schemesof capital grants for agriculture, fishing vessels and ports arebeing studied.    As agricultural plant and machinery are to be eligible for the same tax allowances as industry generally, it isproposed to make an offsetting reduction in the benefits for these items under the new unified scheme of capital grants for agriculture.A separate study is also being carried out on the problems of investment in the mining industry.     The implications for the Northern ireland government&apos;s investment grants scheme will also require attention.Views of the CBI2A.   I have noted in paragraph 9 above the expressed preference of the cbi for free depreciation.     Though their formal advice in this sensewas sent to me only on 21 September, I was already aware of their vie^s,which in some respects are in line with ours.     Their main proposals are as follows:-a. They attach importance to a reduction in Corporation Tax(though they say that they do not regard it as a satisfactory alternative to investment incentives);b. They would like investment grants to be withdrawn;c. They propose abolition of discrimination against serviceand distributive industries.9
25.   In other respects the CBI suggestions are quite unrealistic.They would like investment grants to he replaced by a system of depreciation at choice (a more complicated form of free depreciation)backed at least temporarily with investment allowances.    As mentionedin paragraph 9 above, the cost of this programme would be more than we could contemplate.     Admittedly the CBI have recognised thatdepreciation at choice might have to be reached over a period, but theyhave now proposed that companies should be allowed the choice of deciding during a period of 3-4 years when to change over from investment grants to the new system.     This proposal for a long period of transitionstems from the CBI&apos;s concern that no individual company should be allowedto suffer significantly from the withdrawal of investment grants.     I am afraid that this is bound to be a vain hope.SUMMARY26,   I ask my colleagues to agree that:-i.     \7e should make the change in Corporation Tax referredto in paragraph 11 above;ii.    For capital expenditure on plant and machinery incurredafter 31 October 1971 we should:-a. replace investment grants and existing tax allowancesgenerally by a new tax allowance of 60 per cent Of theexpenditure in the first year of asset life and a uniform25 per cent allowance on the reducing balance in later years;b. allow free depreciation for immobile plant and machinery in development areas;   andc. apply these allowances to all machinery and plant(other than cars) without discrimination between differentsectors of Industry.iii. For new industrial buildings and structures in development and intermediate areas we should continue the present 40 per centinitial allowance indefinitely;10
iv.     For the new ships we should -a.   continue free depreciation, and b.   continue to pay investment grant in respect of shipscontracted for before the date of the announcement of thechange of system, on expenditure incurred for 2 yearsafter that date.v.      We should simplify the pre-1962 rates of depreciationallowance so that all expenditure on plant and machineryincurred up to 31 October 1971 will be written down on thesame basis, using the present 15 per cent, 20 per cent and25 per cent rates of allowance.A treasury Chambers SW128 September 1970ii11
