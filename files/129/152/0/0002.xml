DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(70) 52 COPY NO5424 September 1970CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Minister of technology. This note sets out what is involved in the Cabinets decisions -CM(70) 17th Conclusions, Minute 2 - about my Departments programmes.PESC EXPENDITURE2,        I agreed to reductions totalling  100 million in 1974-75, the precisesavings to be settled in the light of the specific studies which I have put inhand,3, Two-thirds of this Departments prospective expenditure wasinvestment grants, which we have already decided to stop -  665 million in 1974-75,    In the Departments PESC return, the rest to tailed :-1970-71 1971-72 1974-75 371m  336m  292m(a fall of 21%)4.        Since the PESC return, the Government have accepted increasedcommitments to the European space programme, and there are someincreased costs of existing programmes, adding about  16 million in all to the 1974-75 total.    On the other hand,  25 million of the total representsloans to British Nuclear Fuels Ltd and the RadiowChemical Centre Ltd, bothof which will be on a nationalised industry basis (with, we hope, substantialprivate investment) by 1974-75 and must be dealt with in that category andnot in the Vote category,5,        So we start with  283 million (292 plus 16 minus 25) for 1974-75,already  88 million below the 1970-71 figure of  371 million.    I have agreedto reduce this by  100 million, which will bring it to half the present level.This clearly involves large changes in policy, the timing of the results ofwhich and the seriousness of the obstacles to which are difficult to foresee.
6, The following is the make-up of the 283:-1974-75  millionAssistance to IndustryLocal Employment Acts grants and loans (net) 57Helping the coal industry&apos;s rundown 8IRC 40Technological support (including advances to NRBC) 24aGovernment industrial research, and grants to industrial research associations 19aNuclear ProgrammeAEA civil R and D 30Major reactor projects 3AircraftAircraft projects and assistance (Concorde,BAG 311, RB 211 engine, less receipts) 58International space (nothing included for post-Apollo)        7Aerospace civil R and D (including national space technology programme, 5) 20MiscellaneousHeadquarters cost, sea trading and defence accounts,etc 7aIndustrial and aircraft projects not yet specified (butbound to come in four years) 10283I set out in the following paragraphs the manner in which I propose toproceed in order to reduce this total by  100 million.i i7.        If we increase the inducements under the Local Employment Actsin the forthcoming regional policy package, this must be financed from the savings on investment grants and not from this programme.8.        I shall shortly submit proposals about the future of 1958-59    these will provide no new money for 1958-59 in 1974-75.    Saving,  40 million.
9,        A very strict compression of the items noted a in the table might reduce these in the aggregate by  15- 20 million^    There are fiveimportant areas hereS-i0      Development contracts and other forms of support for industry in the application of advanced technology, new inventions,etc both by the Department and via NRDC - eg microelectronics,hovercraft, marine technology, computer application and new development, automation, numerically-controlled machine tools,carbon fibre etc,ii.     Advisory and productivity services, predominantly for smalland medium-size firms, provided in the regions and via ourestablishments and research associations,iiir    Improvement of general efficiency through standards,quality assurance etc.iv. Grants to industrial research associations.v. The Departments industrial establishments,10.       A significant part of the Departments industrial and aerospaceR and D is done to meet the requirements of other Departments,    Thesecosts must be assumed by other Departments,,    Saving,  5 million,11, Implicit in the policies above is a major review of the Departmentsindustrial research work (intra-mural and extra-mural):-i. To ensure that we are not doing work that industry should be doing or paying for,ii. To ensure an industrial orientation for the v/ork that we do,iii. To transfer to other Departments those of our facilities andcontacts which are more appropriate to their activities.12.       I am starting a major review of the Departments nuclear civilR and D financing policy, designed to bring the decision-making and thefinancial responsibility closer to the electricity supply industry and the nuclear plant industry,,    There has in the last few years been a reductionof the order of 25 per cent in sea&apos;s employment, and the present programme provides for a reduction in the cost of civil R and D andreactor projects from the present  50 million a year to  33 million.If the review succeeds, it will either involve a further big reductionin the amount of nuclear R and D (ie closing the establishments egHarwell) or an increase in electricity costs, or both,    I am thinking of a  15 million saving, but there is no basis for making an estimateof how this will turn out,
13.I must rnaka it clear that the review of industrial research and the review of ASA, involving as they may do considerable reductions in the size of Government and Government-financed research establishments,cannot sensibly be undertaken if the Government is at the same time rapidly expanding the financial support and employment of the Research Councils -expenditure of which is due to rise from  110 million in the current year to 129 million in 1974-75, even after the cut of  5 million proposed.    Theincrease in the next four years is about the same as the combined cost ofour industrial research establishments and our grants to industrial research Associationsa    This treatment of non-industrial research in relation to industrial research would be impossible to defend to ourown or sea staffs.14,       On the aircraft side, I shall shortly be submitting proposals toprovide a sound future for Rolls-Royce, which will carry with it clearimplications for the BAG 311,    This will involve a heavy lead in the next two years, but possibly even a saving in the year under discussion here.15,       We have agreed to review Concorde next spring; and we mustcertainly take a very stringent attitude in this review.16,       I do not think it is sensible to try to predict where these projectswill lead over the next four years.    I am sure it is wrong to say that ifwe continue Concorde (ie if we think Concorde is going to be a success)we must abandon Rolls-Royce and BAC 311; or that if we are going to sustain Rolls-Royce, we must abandon Concorde whether or not we thinkit will succeed.    I am going to put a saving in this section, tentatively,at  20- 25 million in 1974-75;  with the proviso that if we see Concordesucceeding, in our review next year and later, it would be absurd from afiscal point of view as well as any other to cancel it,17,       My  100 million saving therefore comes as follows:-  millionIRCCompressionOther Departments40 (paragraph 8)15-20 (paragraph 9)AEAAircraft5 (paragraph 10)15 (paragraph 12)20-25 (paragraph 16)95-105NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES18. I agreed that a reduction of  50 million should be made in the netrequirement of public funds for this Departments nationalised industries in 1974-75.
19,        The estimated investment for these industries (coal, gas,electricity, steel) was put at  942 million, to which must be added the  25 million for the nuclear fuel and radio-chemical companies which after this Session&apos;s legislation will be in the nationalised industrycategory.    In addition there is about  70 million for a recosting of theBritish Steel Corporation and Central Electricity Generating Boardprogrammes and an acceleration of the British Steel Corporationprogramme.    We shall also need to consider separately proposals from the British Steel Corporation for increase in their programme.If the planned productive capacity of these basic industries is too small,the whole industrial effort will be at risk, with power cuts, steel importsetc.    The batter we succeed with cur objectives of industrial expansion,the bigger these investment programmes must be.    We all agree thatthere is too little private industrial investment.    But if we get that right,the public industrial investment must expand.    Obviously we must do all we can to ensure that these industries^ investment is well and realisticallyplanned? and it is sensible to keep them under some pressure.    But it isa different kind of expenditure altogether from defence or social services or assistance to industry.    If we try to treat it the same, looking fouryears ahead, we shall end up by damaging the fiscal situation and our prospects of tax reduction, not improving them020,       What I have agreed to do is to try to limit the cost to the Exchequer.This is in fact what is being done in the social services too? raising theelectricity industry^ earnings target to reduce the need for Exchequerfinance for investment is just the same as raising the Health Servicecharges to reduce the Health Serviced requirements from the Exchequer.21,       We must of course define what we mean by &quot;the net requirement ofpublic funds for the nationalised industries&quot;.    Subject to the technicalities,I would say:-i. Borrowing from the National Loans Fund,ii. Private borrowings guaranteed by the State,iii. Failure to service National Loans Fund loans and PublicDividend Capital, but not other retained cash flow,iv. Funds retained from disposal of peripheral activities.Given a definition of this kind, we should then have to work out what wouldbe &quot;the net requirement of public funds&quot; in 1974-75 implied in theindustries1 investment estimates and present policies, and then developpolicies designed to reduce thi3 by various means to the extent of the required  50 million.    It seems to me that such policies would workin exactly the right direction for our objectives for these industries,
that is to increase their internal financial strength and reduce theirdependence upon the Exchequer, and to encourage as far as we can the narrowing of their industrial scope and reduction of the area ofGovernment finance.22,       Until these calculations have been made, I cannot say whatwould be the implications of a reduction of  50 million in the netrequirement of public funds; but I would regard this as a practicaltarget.J DMinistry of Technology SW123 September 1970/ /
