(confidential)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S &amp;OVEKMENTCP(70) 60 COPY NO24 September 1970CABINETCHAN&amp;ES IN A&amp;RICULTURAL SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS:PROPOSALS FOR INTERIM LEVY SCHEMESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council at our meeting on 23 July (CM(70) 8th Conclusions) we agreed that fullimplementation of our policy for replacing the present system of agricultural support based on deficiency payments by one based on import levies would haveto wait until we knew the outcome of our negotiations for entry into the e.c..I was, however, invited to arrange for Ministers directly concerned to study the Minister of Agriculture1 s proposals for the immediate introduction of interim import levy schemes covering a limited number of commodities.   this study has been carried out by the Ministerial Committee on agricultural policy, on the basis of a detailed report by officials, a summary of whichis annexed.2.    The Committee have come to the conclusion that it would be right to go ahead at once with the proposed interim schemes for cereals, beef and lamb,and probably also with the schemes for minor milk products.   In reaching this conclusion, the Committee have taken fully into account the serious warnings,which were contained in the report by officials and were repeated by ministers from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and from the Board of Trade, concerningthe risks and difficulties we shall face in the discussions with our overseas suppliers which will be necessary before these interim schemes can be imple-mented.   It is clear that we must expect hostile reactions from the UnitedStates, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and a number of othercountries whose rights of access to the United Kingdom market we should be seeking to modify;   that we should face a difficult series of negotiationswith them on the various bilateral and multilateral agreements affected by our proposals;   and that we should perhaps risk possible damage to our commercial interests.1(confidential)
(confidential)3.     Nevertheless, we have always been aware that our proposals for changingagricultural support methods would not be welcome to our overseas suppliersand despite this we gave repeated undertakings while we were in Oppositionthat we would make an early start to the introduction of levy arrangementsonce we were returned to power.   These undertakings were again repeated inthe Queen1s Speech in July.   The farming industry at home will therefore beexpecting us to bring forward proposals soon.   If we do not go ahead withthese interim schemes we snail not be able to produce any convincing reasonto explain why we have broken a clear election pledge.   Moreover, our over-seas suppliers may conclude that we no longer seriously intend to introducecomprehensive changes in support arrangements before the end of the present parliament.4.     The need for such comprehensive changes has been re-emphasised by our discussions on public expenditure in recent weeks.   Our whole economic strategy demands that we should make major Exchequer savings on the cost ofagricultural support, and we shall want to take credit for such savings inthe forthcoming White Paper on public expenditure.   If we make an early start with these interim schemes, we should be able to make some savings in 1971-72and to achieve in 1972-73 the full net benefit of up to  75 million whichthey offer to the Exchequer.   If we were to delay, we should find it much moredifficult to bring a comprehensive scheme of levies into full operation by1974-75 and there would be little prospect of achieving significant savings in earlier years.   The forthcoming White Paper would be bound in these circum-stances to carry much less conviction.5.     In view of the need to make the maximum Exchequer savings, the Committeeon Agricultural Policy concluded that we must aim to introduce levy schemesfor beef and lamb incorporating price levels near the top of the rangessuggested by officials;   and that under the scheme for cereals the pricecould be increased by  7 a ton.   The schemes proposed for minor milk productswould not create direct Exchequer savings and to go ahead with them would undoubtedly complicate negotiations with our overseas suppliers.   They would,however, add  17a million to the returns of our milk producers and would thushelp us to resist pressure for an increase in the price of liquid milk to2(confidential)
(confidential)compensate for the reduction in milk consumption likely to result from theabolition of the welfare and school milk schemes.   The Committee wastherefore inclined to go ahead with these schemes also.conclusion therefore invite my colleagues to endorse the decision of the ministerial committee on Agricultural Policy that we should shortly inform our overseas suppliers of our intention to introduce interim levy schemes covering cereals,beef, lamb and dairy products other than butter and cheese and that we should then press on -with the necessary international negotiations as rapidly aspossible.Privy Council Office SV/123 September 19703
(confidential)Changes in Agricultural Support ArrangementsReport by the Official Committee on Agricultural policy.     The Committee was instructed to consider, on the basis of the Government&apos;policy of replacing, within its term of office, the present agricultural support system based on deficiency payments by one based on import levies, thearrangements and negotiations necessary to introduce in the immediate futureinterim schemes for levies on cereals, beef, lamb and dairy products other thanbutter and cheese.     This report summarises the Committee^ conclusions.     Theschemes proposed are those which, taking account of domestic and internationalconsiderations, seem to be the most feasible interim measures for the commodities concerned.2.     The Committee is to produce a further report by the end of the yearexamining what would be involved in introducing a comprehensive levy schemeafter the outcome of our application to join the e.c. is known.     In that report, it might be necessary to consider whether a comprehensive change inthe method by which we support domestic agriculture, involving the totalelimination of deficiency payments, would have any implications for the levelof support given to agriculture.     But in this report as interim schemes would leave a substantial amount of deficiency payments still in operation,it has not been necessary to consider the general level of support.    as explained in paragraph 5, however, in the case of dairy products where thecost of support is borne by the consumer and not by the Exchequer, interimschemes could be used to provide some increase.     This report provides, as required, an assessment of the consequences of the proposed interim schemesfor the Exchequer, the balance of payments, production and consumption, butwe have not extended this into an examination of the relative economic merits of different methods of agricultural support.1
(confidential)3, Table 1 of this report provides a summary of the main features of the interimschemes proposed.    In each case we have had to take into account the relativeadvantage of general levy schemes, from the point of view of the Exchequer andthe balance of payments, as comp.&apos;required  with levies on a country-by-country basin.For beef and the minor dairy products we consider that general variable levyschemes would be appropriate, under which a threshold price would be set andvariable general levies charged on all imports equivalent to the differencebetween the threshold price and the lowest current offering price.   for cereals we suggest, as an interim arrangement,   the continuation at higher price levels of the existing country levy scheme under which a thresholdprice is set and differential Levies&quot;charged on imports so as to increase their price to the threshold level, leaving the possibility of a switch togeneral levies for consideration in the future in the light of developments.?or lamb, we propose a general fixed levy, consisting of a specific import duty, unrelated to a threshold price, on all imports;   this would give no-assurance of achieving particular price levels, but would be the only effective method as New Zealand dominates the market to such an extent thatshe could manipulate supplies and prices so as to avoid paying a variablelevy.   In the following sections we summarise our conclusions on the likelyeffect of these interim schemes on, respectively, the Exchequer, producers,consumers, the balance of payments, and on our overseas suppliers and our obligations to them.2
(confidential)Effect on Exchequer4.    Following the 1970 Review the estimated cost of agricultural support in1970-71 was  337 million of which  163 million was for the implementation of guaranteed prices and the remainder for production grants and other directsupport.    The interim schemes proposed for cereals, beef and lamb would -assuming market prices to be at the levels adopted for the purposes of the1970-71 Estimates - secure savings on deficiency payments which, with thehigher range of prices proposed, would probably be around  57 million, andwith the lower range of prices around  24 million.    After taking account oflevy receipts and the recoupment of losses of income by livestock producersas a result of increased feeding costs and lower acreage payments on grainretained for feed, the net benefit to the Exchequer in a full year after theintroduction of the schemes, should be of the order of  55 million to 75 million with the higher prices and  25 million to  35 million with thelower.    To raise prices high enough to eliminate the need for deficiency round on cereals, beef and lamb would save  110 million in deficiency round and the net benefit to the Exchequer would then probably be some 120-160 million.     It is not, however, feasible to envisage savings of this order except in the context of a comprehensive levy scheme.     Indeed theamount of Exchequer saving under interim schemes will depend on the level ofthe import levies ultimately decided upon.    Since the guaranteed price for milk is financed by the consumer and not by the Exchequer, the proposed ischemes for dairy products would not provide any savings on deficiency round.     They are also unlikely to provide any significant levy receipts,but could keep the prices of liquid milk and milk products in better balance.No benefit to the Exchequer from these schemes could be expected in 1970-71provided always that negotiations with our overseas suppliers were notprotracted, a substantial part of the savings envisaged might be obtainablein 1971-72.    Offsetting these totals of Exchequer saving would be any consequential increases in social security benefits and in the coat of school meals and of food for the Armed Forces, prisons, etc.     In so far as guaranteed prices to farmers have to be inoreased in any event, the actual saving to theExchequer, compared with present estimates, would be further diminished,though of course these savings would make it possible to keep the cost ofagricultural support below what it would otherwise be., : . v--; -/7^:3(confidential)
(confidential)gffect on Producers5.  The schemes for cereals, beef and lamb would give only a marginal stimulus to home production.   Incentives would continue to be largely determined by thelevel of the guaranteed prices.   The effect of the proposed schemes for dairy products would be to raise the price of milk used for processing in this countryand thus the pool price which the producers receive for their milk overall.Some part of this increase in returns to producers could be used to offset theincreased costs of milk production resulting from higher cereals prices. If,however, the guaranteed price were raised in order to compensate for the increasein costs and allow the whole benefit of these schemes to go to producers, milk production might be stimulated by 50 million gallons per annum (equivalent to10 thousand tons of butter) and producers1 incomes would benefit by almost 17-g- million compared with 1969-70.Affect on consumers6,  All the schemes proposed could together involve price increases whichwould raise the retail food price index by the order of 1- -2-  points.   Theincrease in the cost of living would clearly bear most heavily on those with low incomes.   Households with small children and old age pensioners would be particularly affected by the price in reases on whole milk powder andcondensed milk.   The increases could well give ri3e to pressures for higher wages generally and increased social security benefits.Effect on balance of payments 117.   The schemes proposed for dairy products other than butter and cheeseshould achieve a saving of abeut  It- million in our import bill for the products in question, and the increase in United Kingdom milk production which should follow from the introduction of these schemes should in addition save up to 3 million on imports of butter and cheese.   Since the schemes proposed for cereals, beef and lamb are not expected to stimulate domestic production, anybenefit to the balance of payments would come from a reduction in importsresulting from a fall in consumption,   or from a reduction in landed prices beforepayment of levy. With the higher level of price increases proposed there mightfor these reasons be a benefit to the balance of payments of up to some  30 millin.if(confidential)
(confidential)These gains would, however, be offset to the extent that we incurred lossesarising from compensation to our overseas suppliers in order to securerelease from our international obligations, from retaliation against our exports, and from other export losses caused by reduced foreign exchangeearnings by our overseas suppliers and reduced competitiveness of our exports as a result of higher costs in this country.     These factors cannotbe quantified, but their total effect could be very substantial.    Theeffect of the interim schemes on our overseas suppliers, to which we nowturn, is therefore a factor of great importance in considering such schemes.International Implications8.    Our commercial relations with most of our major trading partners areregulated by a complex of bilateral and multilateral agreements in many ofwhich free access to the United Kingdom market for food and feeding stuffsis a major counterpart to certain commercial advantages accorded to our exports.     Before we could impose even an interim system of import levieswe should either have to negotiate our release from these agreements at an agreed price, or if we decided to withdraw from them after due notice, acceptthe consequential withdrawal of trading advantages given by our partnera*Moreover, we must recognise that the attitude of our overseas suppliers to proposals for interim schemes would be determined mainly by their views onour ultimate intentions as to comprehensive schemes, in terms of both theform and the level of import protection.9.    The proposals for minor milk products differ from those for cereals and meat in that they will yield no saving and little revenue to theExchequer.     They would insulate our market from dumped and subsidisedimports and stimulate milk production in the interests of import saving, butthey carry the risk that our suppliers will regard them as part of the dairy products complex and seek clarification of our future policy for butter and cheese.    These of course are of major concern to many countries and, beoauseof the difficulties which they raise in the context of the e.c. negotiations,Ministers decided to exclude them from consideration at present.    But itseems inevitable that the main suppliers of dairy products will seek thisclarification in any case if we make approaches on beef, cereals and lamb.5 CONFIDENTIAL^
(confidential)10.   Ministers will therefore need to give special consideration to the effecton our commercial relations with our overseas suppliers of these proposals for interim schemes and especially those covering minor dairy products.     Theinternational obligations for whose relaxation or elimination we should haveto pay with loss of trading rights are shown in the final column of Table I.In view of their crucial importance, however, we summarise in the following paragraphs our trading interests with the major countries concerned.11.   Australia (United Kingdom exports in 1%9  321 million, of which85 per cent enjoy preferences) is unlikely to agree to forego her rights to duty-free entry for cereals, meats and dairy products.     We might well bepushed towards terminating the Trade Agreement (6 months&apos; notice) and so tonegotiating a new one covering as many of our preferences as possible;   but before negotiating a more limited agreement the Australians would no doubtwish to see whether we shall succeed in entering the e.c. or not.12.   New Zealand ( 121 million exports, 85 per cent preferential) similarlyhas rights of duty-free entry for meats and dairy products.     She is far moredependent on us than Australia;   and therefore has more to lose.     New ZealandMinisters could hardly agree with us on minor dairy products without assuringher future position on her staple exports of butter and cheese:   it would bevery difficult to give such assurances even if we had an escape clause tocover our joining the e.c..     They are likely to resist on principle our proposals for meats.     In general she would see the threats to her trade ifwe entered the e.c. now extending to her position if we did not enter;   andwould react accordingly.13.   The Irish Republic (United Kingdom exports  330 million) has rights of duty-free entry for meats and dairy products in the Free Trade Area agreement which can only be ended by mutual consent.     She might accept the special arrangements proposed for her meat if satisfied she could get higher priceswithout impairment of free (quantitative) access.     She would be likely to resist the dairy products proposals both for what they are and because ofthe implications for butter and cheese.6
(confidential)14.  BFTA countries generally have rights under Article 22(2) of the StockholmConvention which sets an expansion of agricultural trade as one of the objectives of EFTA so as to &quot;provide reasonable reciprocity to Member Stateswhose economies depend to a great extent on exports of agricultural goods&quot;.Denmark, Finland and Austria in particular will be concerned with milk products and especially with the implications of the interim schemes for butter, and denmark will also be concerned about beef.    Denmark has in addition a specificbilateral right to share in any increase in the United Kingdom market foragricultural products of interest to her.15.   Canada (United Kingdom exports  300 million, 66 per cent preferential) hasGATT rights to duty-free entry for wheat and some other cereals.      Althoughthe interim proposal for raising minimum import prices for cereals is unlikely to reduce her exports significantly, she would be apprehensive about our price and access intentions after the expiry of the Five-Party Agreement* and wouldbe likely to take a tough line on so vital a commodity.16.   The USA (United Kingdom exports  900 million) has GATT rights to duty-free entry for wheat and yellow maize (her main cereals exports to us).     They wouldcertainly insist on our going through the regular GATT procedure to unbind(which requires compensating concessions) if we could not agree on price levels,like Canada, the USA will look to what is going to happen after the Five PartyAgreement expires.    They will see in our proposals an axtention of agriculturalprotectionism likely to harm their exports of cereals and coming on top of the damage they have already suffered from the Common Agricultural Policy.    TheUnites States Administrations resistance to increasing protectionist pressureswill be weakened and doubt cast on its view that we shall have a liberalisinginfluence on the e.c..17.   Argentina (United Kingdom exports  47 million) is concerned with beaf andcereals.    She and the other Latin Americans are likely to claim the protectionof Article 37 of the &amp;ATT whioh requires us to refrain from introducing orincreasing duties or other trade barriers on items of particular export interest*The Five Party Agreement with Argentina, Australia, Canada and the USA has theeffect of suspending our obligations under GATT and allows the operation of thepresent m p arrangement (but no other m p arrangement) until the Agreementexpires on 30 June 1971.
(confidential)to less developed countries.    Restriction of her exports of beef to theUnited Kingdom may well lead to disproportionate retaliation, eg by excludingus from public contracts.18.   In sum, a wide range of discussions both bilateral and multilateral willbe necessary before we can introduce our proposals.     They will take some time,and will have to be carried on concurrently with our e.c. negotiations and willprobably interact with them.     Our suppliers will know from Government policystatements that the schemes are only interim ones and will be bound to probe insome detail our final intentions.    They will wish to obtain terms whichcompensate for the trading advantages they will lose, and will also be tempted to try to prolong the negotiations until the outcome of our application to join the e.c. is clear.19.  We should in fact be starting to unravel a major part of the complex of agreements on which our commercial relations with mo3t of our important tradingpartners have been built up over the 40 years since the Ottawa Agreements.     Itwould be imprudent to embark on such negotiations without facing the realpossibility that they could not be carried through without denouncing the mostimportant of our Commonwealth Trade Agreements (with all the costs to our exports which this would involve) as well as paying the price for unbinding inthe GATT a number of duties, on cereals in particular, which are important tothe USA and Canada.    Unless we are ready to take these steps, if necessary, wemay be unable to make any progress;   to withdraw would be embarrassing and would leave a legacy of uncertainty and resentment.CONCLUSIONS20.   Our main conclusions are -a.    The Exchequer savings from these interim schemes would largely dependon how far we were prepared to go in the face of the hostile reactions wemust expect from our overseas suppliers.    Even if negotiations wentsmoothly  there is now no  possibility of savings  being  made in1970-71, and if negotiations became protracted only small savingsmight be obtained in 1971-72.     If in the light of the reactions of our8(confidential)
(confidential)suppliers we decided to go for the higher range of prices proposed forthese interim schemes, the net benefit to the Exchequer in a full year(ie probably from 1972-73) should be  55-75 million;     but if we settledfor the lower range of prices proposed it might be only  25-35 million.Import savings would be comparatively small (between  17^ million and 31 million) even when the schemes were in full operation;   the strengthof the reaction to be expected from our overseas suppliers could be such that the overall balance of payments effect would be adverse, at least inthe short term.b. Negotiations with our overseas suppliers would be tough, as we shouldbe asking them to release us from&apos;treaty obligations which are the counter-part of trade concessions made to us.    We should be doing so over aperiod when some of them would be pressing us to urge their claims in the eec negotiations;   and reactions would be more severe if before negotiations were concluded the level of support to United Kingdom agriculture were tobe raised for in their eyes on both price level and system we should bemoving in the direction of the Common Agricultural Policy which they somuch dislike.     It is no more than realistic to assume that the price weshould have to pay in concessions to secure the agreement of our overseas suppliers would be high.     If we could not obtain agreement the cost of going ahead would be still higher.c. On the other hand market prices for the main agricultural productsare presently very firm, and on this basis the argument can be developedon the following lines.    This is the most favourable situation in which to embark on threshold (minimum import) prices of the sort proposed underthe interim schemes.     If they could be negotiated, not only wouldExchequer savings be secured, but prices to consumers would not need torise above the level already reached on the free market.     This wouldmake presentation of the policy easier internally and would facilitatefurther increases in consumer prices, whether we go into the e.c. oroperate the Government&apos;s new support policy outside.    A start now oninterim proposals should help to ensure that the full potential savingscontemplated for the change in support arrangements would be realisedduring the lifetime of the present Parliament.    A delayed start wouldmake this more difficult.9(confidential)
(confidential)a.    Against this we could scarcely hope to have negotiated these interimschemes and brought them into effect before mid-1971, and we should thenbe within 6 months at most of knowing the likely outcome of the EECnegotiations.     If we failed to get into the e.c., we might want to moveover as rapidly as possible to a comprehensive levy system which would realise much larger Exchequer savings than these interim schemes.(Officials will be presenting a report on such a comprehensive systemlater in the year.)21.   We are therefore faced with the problem that, on the one hand, overseas suppliers as well as the home industry will be expecting the Government to initiate action shortly, as foreshadowed in !Phe Queen*s Speech on the openingof the new Parliament:   on the other hand these interim schemes would involve us in a very difficult series of negotiations with our principal overseas suppliers, at a time when our relations with them may well be strained bydevelopments in our negotiations for entry into the e.c..22.   In practice there are two choices open, and Ministers will wish to decide between them.     Both would be compatible with the Governments determination to achieve major Exchequer savings by 1974-5*      &apos;.!,&apos;e,can either -a.     despite the risks and difficulties foreseen,   to ahead andnegotiate forthwith to get the interim schemes in operation as soonas possible;or  b.     postpone action to implement the change in support arrangements untilthe outcome of the e.c. negotiations is known.23.   If Ministers decide in favour of course a., we reco:.imend that, because the seriousness of the issues could not be concealed, an initiative should be taken at a high level.      If we tried to start discussions on a lower key, we mightwe]], find that our suppliers would quickly raise them to top levels.     If tinscourse is preferred, we suggest that the first steps should be a carefullydrafted message from a senior Minister to the United States, Australian, NewZealand, Canadian and Irish Governments, (similar approaches to Denmark andArgentina might be made at a somewhat later date), explaining the reason for the10
(confidential)&apos;ioverment&apos;s new policy, giving such reassurance as is possible about itsinterne-.: effects on the trade of their countries, and proposing that discussions should be opened with the object of exploring how a start could best be madeon implementing the Government&apos;s policy and what changes in the tradearrangements on both sides would be necessary for this purpose.     .Ve should then open negotiations by proposing price levels at or near the top of therarj?e suggested in the annexes with the aim of securing the maximum possiblebenefit to the Exchequer.24.   If, on the other hand, given the problem of timing, the hostile reactions to dc expected from other countries, and the difficulties of negotiation,Ministers were to favour course b., they could announce that as negotiations to join the e.c. have now been launched with the intention of bringing them during 1971 to (or within sight of) a successful conclusion which wouldinvolve the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, the Government had concluded that it would be inexpedient and premature to embark concurrentlyon a parallel set of negotiations affecting agricultural markets and support.The announcement might reaffirm the Government&apos;s intention to move over to a comprehensive levy system if, contrary to our hopes, our negotiations with the eec do not prove successful;   and could if desired also make it clear that thenecessary contingency planning for such a move was in hand.     Provided the EECnegotiations wore not allowed to drag on inconclusively beyond the end of 1971,it should still be possible in the event of their failure to introduce a comprehensive scheme in time to secure much, if not all, of the full Exchequersaving by 1974-5, but we should need to consider this more fully in our final report on a comprehensive scheme.11(confidential)
