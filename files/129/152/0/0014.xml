THIS MOMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC 1AJESTY*S government cp(?0) 64 COPY NO28 September 1970CABINETHOUSING finance memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government1.    I undertook to consider whether, before the public expenditure white Paper was published, I should make a general statement abouthousing finance (CM(70) 17th Conclusions, Minute 2).2.    My study of housing finance is in an advanced stage and I intend tobring comprehensive proposals before the Cabinet towards the end ofOctober.     These will incorporate the most thoroughgoing  reform of housing finance attempted in this century.     Meantime the Cabinet may wish to know the bread lines on which I am proceeding.3. The main features of my plan, which I have yet to discuss fully withthe Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, are as follows -i.   Pair rents would be established as the objective towards which local authorities must work in determining rents for council houses over the years ahead.ii.   The progression from the present level of rents tovards fairrents would need to be prescribed and to be subject to annual11    limits of increase.iii.   There would be a further move to fair rents from controlledrents in the private sector;   landlords of improved houses would be able to charge fair rents earlier than under existing legislation.1
iv.   There would be a national minimum scheme of rent rebates and allowances covering needy families in rented accommodation inthe public and private sectors, administered by the localauthorities.v.   Existing subsidies to local authorities would be withdrawn,the pace of withdrawal being related to the pace at which theprogression to fair rents is to be accomplished.vi.   New, smaller and diminishing subsidies would be paid to localauthorities with high costs and authorities with deficits intheir housing accounts;   and there would be subsidies towardsthe costs of slum clearance.vii.   There would be a substantial Exchequer contribution towardsthe cost of the rent rebate and allowance scheme.4.    There will be important detailed decisions to be taken.    We shall need to have machinery for determining fair rents which will ensure that local authorities carry out our intentions, and that tenants and rate-payers have some assurance that the fair rent policy is being fairlyapplied.    We shall need to decide on the conditions for the further move into rent regulation.     The broad principles of the rent rebate scheme will need to be settled and the Exchequer contribution towards the cost.The size and scope of new subsidies will raise a number of points for decision.     The charging of fair rents in the public sector wouldincreasingly give rise to surpluses in local authority housing revenueaccounts.    My memorandum will examine the implications of this,including proposals for applying any surpluses.5-     But one major issue overshadows all the others;   that is the paceat which the progression towards fair rents should take place.     Thiswill need to be considered against the background of other changesaffecting family expenditure and taxation, and also with an eye to thelength of the period between the institution of the new system and the achievement of fair rents (with any progression, the time needed to2
reach the ultimate objective will vary greatly between authorities indifferent parts of the country).     Our decision here, which will directly affect the pace of withdrawal of subsidies, is the major determinant ofthe scale of Exchequer savings.6.    We must also have in mind that before our detailed proposals are published it will be necessary, as we promised in our Election manifesto,to have full consultations with the local authority associations, andthere will be need for some room for manoeuvre in these discussions.i7.    Until decisions have been taken on these main issues - and especially on the pace of withdrawal of subsidies - it is impossible to make sensibleestimates of the effect on public expenditure.     I have however hadrough estimates prepared to show the order of savings which might beexpected to result if the annual average rent increases towards the fair rent level were at 10s Od a week (with a maximum of 1.5s Od for anytenant) and 15s Od a week (with a maximum of  1 for any tenant)respectively.     On the assumption that the progression to fair rents canbegin on 1 April 1972 (this is, in my view, the earliest possible date and it may be difficult to achieve it),   these calculations show totalsavings, of current prices, in public expenditure terms, of the orderof  135 million in 1974-75 and  215 million in 1975-76 on the basis of a10s Od a week progression;   and  205 million in 1974-75 and  280 million in 1975-7^ with a 15s Od a week progression.i i8.     If the Cabinet agree, I would be ready to make a statement whichwould place these policies in perspective.     The statement would also make clear our oonstructive approach to housing finance, and provide a background for a global reference to savings in the Expenditure white paper.     I am in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theLord President of the Council and the Secretaries of State for Scotlandand Wales on the terms of a statement reflecting the proposals In thismemorandum.PWMinistry of Housing and Local GovernmentWhitehall SW128 September 19703
