ffOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST VS government cp(70) 55 COPY NO 5 424 September 1970CABINETPUBLIC LIBRARY charges memorandum by the Paymaster general. At their meeting on 15 September (CM(70) 17th Conclusions,Minute 2) the Cabinet took note that the proposal for the introductionof public library charges offered certain difficulties and would be specifically referred to them for more detailed consideration.    Thepurpose of this memorandum is to set forth the issues involved,2.        Any proposal to levy public library charges will require decisions on a number of practical points!a. The nature of the power which Parliament is to be asked toauthorise.    Are local authorities to be given the option to imposelibrary charges or is a charge to be mandatory?b. The peOpls to be charged.    Children, students and old age pensioners should probably be exempted.c. The nature of the charge.    It would be too expensiveadministratively to collect a small charge each time a bookwas borrowed; but if an annual charge were levied, it wouldbe difficult and perhaps impossible to ensure that one registrationwas not stretched to cover several people&apos;s use.d0      The level (or perhaps the maximum level) of the charge.This would have to be determined with due regard to the estimatedamount a given charge would produce, the probable effect onlibrary use, the cost of collection and the political impact.It would be difficult to establish the likely yield of a charging system.No doubt there would be pressure for the proceeds to be ploughed back into the library service, but it would probably not be practicable to vary the normal procedures whereby there would be a reduction in the net expenditure of local authorities from which both they and (through areduction in rate support grant) the Government would benefit.    these issues would all need careful consideration and discussion with the interests concerned before a firm view could be reached on what the best system would be; and this would take some time,
3.        These practical considerations, however, leave aside the broaderquestions of principle,,    At a time when we are looking for elbow-room tomake possible a change in the pattern of public expenditure, it is right thatwe should consider carefully v/hether the public library system shouldcontinue to be free at the point of consumption or whether users (withcertain exemptions) should be asked to pay at least a contribution towardsthe cost of the service..    From the financial point of view a decision tointroduce charges might reduce net public expenditure, though not before1972-73 at the earliest., by some  5 million (no close estimate can be made;at this stage); and it might have the effect of slowing down the growth of a service which has been steadily expanding in recent years.    These mightbe counted as gains.4.        But against these we have to weigh other factors.    First there is our PartyJs record on the subject.    The public library service originatedin an Act of 1850, which established the principle that the service should be free.    This principle has been maintained through all succeedinglegislation.    Several investigating committees, notably the KenyonCommittee in 1927 and the Roberts Committee in 1959, have recommendedfirmly against charging.    The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964specifically laid it down that no charges should be imposed for borrowingbooks.    Several Conservative spokesmen at the time, of whom I was one,argued strongly against the imposition of charges.    To reverse this linewould be to break with a long-established national tradition and would represent a volte face in Conservative policy05,        We should also be runaing counter to international trends.    Bothin Europe and in Commonwealth countries the tendency in recent years hasbeen to move away from charging for library services; it would be seenthat, in a field in which we had been among the leaders, we were turningback,6,        Furthermore it would be argued with some force that no system ofcharging could be devised which would avoid inequity: this is partly because the standard of the service available in different areas varieswidely, especially as between town and country, and partly because any scheme based on an annual charge would hit the occasional userdisproportionately hard, by comparison with the regular user,7,        Finally it would be argued that the ultimate justification ofthe public library service is its value for education in the broadestsense; any system of charging would certainly cut down the use ofpublic libraries and would deter most strongly the marginal users,including many school-leavers, whom it is most desirable from the educational point of view for the library service to hold.    Moreovera charging scheme could be an incentive for libraries to buy the morepopular books (and so keep up membership and revenue) at the expenseof books that are of greater value for students and the serious reader,
80        There is one further point which, if not one of the principle, is ofspecial importance, namely the additional manpower which the libraryservice would require if charges were introduced,,    There are over 400library authorities in the country, with, I estimate, a total of some 12,000library service points.    Although not all of these would be involved inadministering a charging scheme, a considerable additional burden of clerical and cashier work would be imposed.    No precise calculationcan be made of the manpower required, but a study carried out inLeicestershire of the implications of imposing charges suggests that over the country as a whole the requirement might amount to as many as 1,000 extra employees.9.        These considerations make it clear that a library charging scheme,while offering the immediate prospect of a limited net reduction in public expenditure, would be highly controversial and generally unpopular.Legislation would be needed and it is at least doubtful whether a majorityof the House of Commons would vote in favour of a charge.10.       I invite my colleagues to consider whether, in view of the practicalcomplications and difficulties of principle which it would involve, thisproposal should be pursued further.EDepartment of Education and Science Wl23 September 19703
