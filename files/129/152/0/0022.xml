;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 72 COPY NO     g j9 October 1970CABINETANALYSIS OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMESNote by the Prime minister in my note CP(70) 37 I gave a short account of the work that was in hand for establishing a new Central Capability Unit at the service of the cabinet and its committees.    That note made it clear that the work of this Unitwould be complementary to the analytical work done by Departments and bythe Treasury in their analysis of public expenditure programmes, to theimprovement of which the business team have been giving their attentionas a priority project.    The business team*s detailed proposals are being prepared for presentation to Departments very shortly but I should like mycolleagues to be aware of the broad lines of what is proposed and theattached note has been prepared to this end.E H10 Downing Street SW18 October 1970
ANNEjlANALYSIS OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE programmes. The planning and control of public expenditure has increasingly-centred on the annual Public Expenditure Surveys, linked with the medium term economic assessments of the economy.    In this way a more rationaland systematic basis has been developed for the broad allocation of resources to the public sector, and for detailed allocation to its component parts.    The resulting system is a powerful instrument of demand management and financial control.    It provides a basic element of theinformation Ministers need to enable them to balance the claims of competing blocks of public expenditure.2.        However there are two respects in which it does not provide all theinformation that is needed for this purpose.    It does not call for explicitstatements of the objectives of expenditure in a way that would enable aMinisters piano to be tested against general Government strategy: nor canit embody detailed analysis of existing programmes and of major policy options on them.    Much work has been undertaken in special ad hoc policyreviews and in long term studies, but it has become increasingly clear thatthe public expendituie survey system would be strengthened by further developments of this kind.    The business team are putting forward proposalsfor a systematic advance in this direction.    Departments would be asked toprovide programme reviews that would be directed to meeting the needsjust outlined.    These reviews would be related to the present Departmentalsubmissions in the public expenditure survey cycle and would be designedto provide Ministers with an opportunity to discuss the possibilities of alternative policy options which can then be explored in greater depth before final decisions are taken on the expenditure programmes.3.        The nature and timing of the reviews would require the most carefuldiscussion between Departments as would the exact processes by which theywere studied, related to one another and brought into practical effect whendecisions were taken on the public expenditure programme ao a whole.    Butit is already clear that they would involve a greater emphasis on the definition of objectives and the expressing of programmes so far as possiblein output termsj and that the presentation and examination of alternativeprogrammes would be of great importance.
