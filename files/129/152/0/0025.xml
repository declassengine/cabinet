MIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 75 COPY no. 8 October 1970CABINETRENT ALLOWANCES FOR PRIVATE TENANTSMemorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal government at its meeting on 1 October the Cabinet invited me, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Public Building and Works, to circulate a paper explaining more fully the proposal for rent allowances for private tenantswhich I envisage as one of the necessary measures for effecting the reform of housing finance.    (CM(70) 25th Conclusions, Minute 4).THE NATURE OF RENT ALLOWANCES2.     My proposal is that, just as a public sector tenant would be eligible for a rent rebate if he could not meet the full rent of his dwellingwithout hardship, so a private unfurnished tenant in that situation shouldbe eligible for a rent allowance which would be calculated on the same basis as the rebate payable to the council tenant and form part of the samenational scheme.    The rent allowance would be paid only if the dwellingwas a reasonable one for the tenant to live in and if the rent itself was reasonable.    The allowance would be a subsidy to the tenant, not to hislandlord.    To ensure that the landlord could not raise the rent by theamount of the allowance, the allowance would be paid only if the rent hadbeen registered as a fair rent under the Rent Act 1968.THE CASE FOR RENT ALLOWANCES3.     There are numerous strong arguments for introducing rentallowances for private tenants.    First the incomes of private tenants aregenerally no higher than those of council tenants and those of them whoare still subject to rent control are the poorest section of the community.No fair rent has yet been registered for the great majority of private tenants and when it is, many of them will have to meet rent increases of up to  3 a week or more.    It is a cardinal point of our housing policiesthat all tenants should, in the v/ords of our Election Manifesto, &quot;receive a fair deal&quot;.    In the case of council tenants we are committed to securing a measure of rent relief through rent rebates for the poorer tenants.    Notto give the equivalent help to private tenants would be unfair to the poorerprivate tenants who have to pay the full rent.1
4.      They would be worse off than the poorer council tenants (and the poorer owner-occupiers, who obtain tax relief on mortgage interest or the equivalent option mortgage subsidy).    This situation would be impossibleto defend in the context of a policy for housing finance directed ateliminating the special advantages enjoyed by council tenants and atensuring that help with housing was concentrated on where it was roostneeded.5.     Second, as long as many of the poorer private tenants cannot obtainrent relief, whereas all council tenants can, the demand for council houseswill continue to be artifically inflated.    There are over 2 million tenants of private unfurnished accommodation.    Those of them who have to paythe full fair rent but would qualify for a rebated council rent would have a continuing incentive to become council tenants and *.vould create anadditional demand for council housing, particularly in the conurbationswhere housing shortages are worst.    As a result public sector investment in housing would be kept at a higher level than would otherwise benecessary.6.     Third, the further decontrol of controlled private tenancies islikely to involve rent increases of up to 45s a week for about three quarters of controlled tenants outside London.    The remaining quarter, and80 per cent of controlled tenants in London, are likely to have rent increases of between 45s and 75s a week and some 10 per cent of Londontenants will probably have increases of over 75s a week.    Without rentallowances such increases would give rise to two difficulties.    First theywould impose severe hardship on the poorer tenants and many of them would become homeless, failure to pay the rent being a ground foreviction.    Secondly it would be necessary to mitigate their hardship byphasing the increases over something like 5 years or even longer and soto prolong the decontrol operation until far into the next Parliament.With rent allowances the phasing operation could be carried out much more quickly.7.     Fourth, in the case of those controlled dwellings which could berapaired and improved, a long phasing period before the full fair rent isreached has already been shown to discourage landlords from going ahead with the works required for decontrol.    Unless we can, by introducingrent allowances, shorten this phasing period, we shall fail to savesubstantial numbers of dwellings from declining into irreparable slumdom.It has also become clear that the procedures for achieving decontrol need to be greatly simplified.    Landlords find them too complex, lengthy,expensive, and sometimes abortive, with the result that improvements which ought to be made are being lost.    These procedures were designedto protect tenants from works leading to a rent which they could not afford,and could be dismantled if rent allowances are introduced.    We strongly criticised both the phasing period and the procedures when we were in opposition.2
8.     Fifth, many of the families with incomes around or below the supplementary Benefit level, but who are not eligible for supplementary benefit, are private tenants.    Rent allowances would help them with a major item in their basic expenditure and so make a significant contribu-tion towards solving the intractable problem of family poverty.9.     Sixth, oux* 1957 Rent Act provided for the retention of the substantial measure of rent control which still remains.    With thepassage of time, this has increasingly involved protecting the tenant by a continuing subsidy from the landlord.    It would be difficult now toremove this subsidy from the poorer tenants without some counter-vailing subsidy from public funds.10.     Seventh, for many landlords the controlled tenancy is a burden which causes them hardship.    The landlords of controlled tenanciesare not typically substantial property companies.    Most own smallaumbers of houses and have small incomes.    Surveys have shown that over half of them own only one property, half of them are over 60 andmany have incomes around or below the Supplementary Benefit level.Undoubtedly many such landlords are poorer than the tenants whom theysubsidise.11.    Finally, if we do not introduce rent allowances we shall be in an embarrassing position viz-a-viz those authorities who may be expectedto follow the example of Birmingham and others and seek power underlocal Acts to pay rent allowances to their private tenants.    We could nolonger, as our predecessors did, adopt an attitude of benevolentneutrality towards such authorities once we are publicly committed to a mandatory national scheme of rent rebates limited to council tenants.We would be placed in the awkward position of either opposing the localauthority&apos;s scheme or of defending our failure to support schemes ofthis kind which are most needed in those areas of housing stress wherehousing problems already impose the heaviest burden on the rates.RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTERING RENT ALLOWANCES12.     I propose that rent allowances should be administered by thelocal authorities rather than by a Government agency such as the supplementary Benefits Commission.    Local authorities are the naturalagents for administering rent rebates for all their own tenants as part oftheir management function and it would be convenient if they took on theadministration of rent allowances for the smaller number of private tenants, including those eligible for Supplementary Benefit,    They alreadyadminister rate rebates for private tenants and it would be convenientand logical for these closely connected remissions to be administered bythe same authority.    Moreover to make local authorities responsible forrent allowances would be in line both with our policy for making themresponsible for the totality of housing needs in their area and with therecommendations of the Seebohm Report which we support.3
13.     Local authorities would have to contribute towards the cost ofrebates and allowances a sum from the rates sufficient to ensure carefuland economic administration.    I suggest 25 per cent of the cost of rent rebates and allowances plus the cost of administration but the fractioncan be settled later.    Such a financial stake would give authorities an incentive to avoid a subsidy towards the wasteful use of housing space.THE MECHANICS OF ADMINISTERING RENT ALLOWANCES14.     My proposals for housing finance will substantially reduce theadministrative burden now falling on local housing authorities and theHousing Departments.    Under my proposals every local authority would be obliged to operate for all its tenants a rent rebate scheme basedon a prescribed model.    Most authorities already have, and in futureevery authority would have to have, machinery for dealing with applications for rebates, verifying the income declarations of the applicants, reviewing their entitlement at 6-monthly intervals and ensuring that their rents were correctly rebated.    To extend this machinery to cope with applications for rent allowances from private tenants would not substantially increase the administrative burden of theaverage authority.    While the total number of people theoreticallyeligible for help would increase by about 40 per cent, in practice theproportion of extra applicants would be much smaller.    As with other means-tested benefits or remissions - eg rate rebates - take-up amongprivate tenants would be low initially and increase only gradually.Moreover private tenants now subject to rent control would become eligible for rent allowances only by stages as their dwellings passed into rent regulation.15.     The main administrative effect of introducing rent allowanceswill arise in the conurbations where private tenants are concentrated.This is illustrated by Birmingham who are now introducing rentallowances for their private tenants and who have found little difficulty inabsorbing this additional function in their existing arrangements forgiving rent rebates to their tenants.    They now grant some 14,000 rent rebates.     They expect in the first year to deal with 3, 000 applicationsfor rent allowances from a total of 60,000 private tenants in the city.For this purpose they have increased their staff operating rent relief from 18 to 24 and the administrative cost is expected to rise from 27, 000 to  39, 000 a year.16.     The local authorities&apos; task of administering rent allowances (andrent rebates) will be substantially simplified if it proves possible tointroduce a multi-purpose means test to cover a wide range of themeans-tested benefits which the local authorities administer.    I under-stand that officials expect in due course to be able to submit proposalsfor such a test for the consideration of the Secretary of State for social services.4
17.     To facilitate the prudent administration of rent allowances thelocal authority would operate safeguards against possible abuses.    Forexample it would have to take account of only a proportion of the registered rent for the purpose of calculating the rent allowance, if thedwelling was larger than the tenant reasonably required or was in an area of high property values in which it was unnecessary for the tenantto live and in which he could not reasonably be expected to live if no rent allowance were available.    Again, in order to avoid fraudulent collusionbetween landlord and tenant, the local authority would have to satisfyitself that the rent had been registered and be able to establish whatrent was actually paid.18.     In some individual localities rent officers might be unable to copeimmediately with the demand for registration which would result from the requirement that a rent allowance is payable only if the rent has been registered as a fair rent.    I do not propose to make a substantial increase in the rent officer complement for this purpose.    I suggestthat the local authority might be given discretion, until the fair rentcould be registered by the rent officer tc base the rent allowance (asBirmingham do now) on its own assessment of a reasonable rent havingregard to the rent fixed for its own most nearly comparable dwelling,or the actual rent, whichever was lower.COST19.     The cost to public funds of helping private tenants eligible for supplementary Benefit would not be substantially affected by the intro-duction of rent allowances per se, since the total subsidy received by such tenants (whether by way of Supplementary Benefit or rent allowance)depends mainly on the rent of their dwelling.    Thus the cost of introducing rent allowances is in effect limited to the cost of suchallowances to unfurnished private tenants who are not eligible for supplementary Benefit ie to tenants in work.    Any estimate of this costmust allow for a number of factors including;-i.     The effect on rents of further decontrol of controlledtenancies.ii.     The timing of the introduction of rent allowances.    I amassuming that for practical reasons these could not beintroduced before January 1973.iii. The likelihood that take-up of rent allowances will be lowinitially owing to the h;uuan inertia governing the take-upof any new means-tested benefit.iv. The terms of the scheme.5
The best broad estimate (under the terms of the scheme I have in mind for council tenants) which can at present be provided of the cost to theExchequer and rates of introducing rent allowances for privateunfurnished tenants in Great Britain is as followsLVAzJA   1973-74    \3JA-JA.   LiTJL-liless than  5m         15 m  20 m  25 mThe figure for 1975-76 is based on a generous estimate of the numberof tenants likely to take advantage of the scheme.THE PLACE OF RENT ALLOWANCES IN HOUSING POLICY20,     I consider that rent allowances are an integral part of anyreform of housing finance designed to widen the citizen*s area of choicein housing and to remove intervention by the Government in themanipulation of the housing market.    One major aim of the reform mustbe to make this market work better, with greater freedom of choicefor the householder.    This situation can only be brought about speedilyand equitably if the private tenant, like the council tenant, is protectedfrom those of its effects which bear hardly on the poorer members ofthe community.ENCOURAGING OWNER OCCUPATION21.     At its meeting on 1 October the Cabinet also invited me to reporton the possibility of encouraging owner occupation.    The proposals forthe reform of housing finance have the effect of narrowing the gap between renting and mortgage payments and will therefore increase thedemand for houses to buy through a mortgage.    Our other policieseg on incentives for savings and lending by local authorities will need to take this into account.    For this reason I have refrained from pressing the building societies to lower their lending rate, as I amabove all concerned not to jeopardise their inflow of funds which depends primarily on the competitiveness of the rate of interest whichthey can offer to investors.    In return, and as a further step towardsmaking mortgagee easier to obtain, I have obtained the building societies&apos; informal agreement that they will be ready, in the spring of1971, to agree to change the option mortgage scheme to allow the holder of an option mortgage to opt into a normal mortgage at the endof 4 years, instead of at the end of 5 years as at present.    This willadvance by one year the first date for opting out for those who joined the scheme at the beginning.22.     I understand that the Secretary of State for Scotland is also considering several possible measures to encourage home ownershipin Scotland.P WMinistry of Housing and Local Government SWl8 October 19706
