AIRBUSES AMD THE RB211-61 ENGINEReport by OfficialsSUMMARY AND conclusions.     The first priority must be to consider what should be done aboutthe present difficulties facing Rolls Royce in the development and production of the RB 211-22.2.     If the Cabinet decide to assist the RB 211-22 to completion the major question is, of course, whether they are then prepared also toprovide the necessary finance for the BAC 311 and the RB 211-61.   support for the RB 211-61 inevitably involves support for the BAC 311 as wellsince there would be no adequate market for the engine without this aircraft.   It would be possible but, from the point of view of practical politics, difficult to develop the BAC 311 with an American engineinstead of the RB 211-61.3.     The BAC 311 with the RB 211-61 is a more hopeful project than someothers which successive Governments have supported over the years althoughthe experience with the RB 211-22 must cast doubts on the ability of rolls Royce to produce the RB 211-61 on time and within the present financial estimates.   Nevertheless all large aircraft projects areinevitably risky and if we wish to retain an ability to manufacture largocivil subsonic aircraft, and large civil aero engines, this doubleproject offers our best chance of being able to do so.   If the aircraftsells in the numbers forecast its foreign exchange earnings will be considerable.   On the other hand these earnings will have been bought ata high price in terms of the resources used and the Government has verylittle prospect of recovering its investment.4.     The BAC 311 would provide alternative work for the British aircraft industry if Concorde were cancelled.   But unilateral cancellation of concorde would be more difficult for our international relations if ithad been preceded by a decision to develop the BAC 311 in competition with the A500B.1
confidential.     If the very large Government expenditure ( 144 million) involvedin support of the BAC 311 and the RB 211-61 is unacceptable less costlyoptions would be -a. to encourage BEA to buy the Lockheed L1011.   Project cost toHor Majesty&apos;s Government - Nil.   This would help Lockheed in theirpresent difficult situation and increase RB211-22 sales.   It wouldnot however give Rolls Royce a viable future in major civil engines,nor would it preserve the experienced BAC team.   BEA vrould incur adollar bill estimated at some $400 million over 10 years from 1975;this has been taken into account in the economic assessment of thealternative courses;b. to finance development of the A300B-7 and support the RB211-61.Project cost to Her Majesty&apos;s Government perhaps  70-90 million.The technical specification of the A300B-7 is only slightlyinferior to that of the BAC 311 but the Ministry of Technology hasserious doubts as to the ability of the untried consortium to makea success of the programme, to carry conviction with world airlinesand to sell their aircraft in free competition with BAC, Boeing,Douglas or Lockheed.   The B7 version with the RB211-61 in particularwould have limited sales prospects, because it would be offered in competition with a version powered by General Electric CE6 engineswith which the A300B will have been associated from the outset.   IfBEA were constrained to take it against their better judgement, theymight be the only substantial buyers.   Neither Rolls Royce nor theMinistry of Technology regard the A300B-7 as a satisfactory launchingbase for the RB211-61; there would be a serious risk of worseningRolls Royce&apos;s financial position.   However this course has some political advantage as it would involve co-operation with theEuropean aircraft industry rather than increased dependence on theUnited States;c. to support the BAC 311 with an American engine.   Project cost toHer Majesty&apos;s Government probably about  84 million.   Even if satisfactory arrangements could be made for Rolls Royce to build theCE6-50 under licence, it would be difficult to defend the rejection of the RB211.-61 - particularly if we were at the same time providingRolls Royce with large additional sums for the RB211-22.   ! I6,    A decision is needed urgently.   BAC will be unable to continue workon the 311 after the end of October without financial support; if Rolls Royceare to have the RB211-61 ready in time for a BAC311, they should start now.2
MAIN REPORT10     At its meeting on 30 July, the Cabinet decided to consider aircraft projects further in September0   This paper deals with BAC 311, A300B, andthe Rolls Royce situation0   By way of background, the first two sectionsbriefly explain the world aircraft market situation and present aircraft industry structure and policy,THE WORLD AIRCRAFT MARKET2,     In the last few years, world airlines have placed massive orders forthe Boeing 747 and the American trijets (Douglas DC10 and Lockheed LlOll)0This, and a decline in profitability which has hit American airlir.es inparticular, has caused a slowing-down in recent ordering, and conditionsduring the next year or two are likely to remain uncertain,,   Nevertheless,in the longer run orders will pick up with continued growth of passenger and freight traffic 0   Assuming a minimum growth rate of about 10 per cent per annum (the International Civil Aviation Organisation forecast an averagegrowth of scheduled passenger traffic of 14 per cent per annum to 1980), thevalue of the market for civil aircraft in the next 10 years, excluding theSine/Soviet bloc, is estimated to be about  30,000 million (of which 7,000 million worth is already on order) 0   The United Kingdom has thelargest national home market in the western world outside America0   UnitedKingdom airline purchases are likely to average more than  200 million per year in the late 1970s.   In 1969. our aircraft exports v?ere vrorth 250 million, and 60 per cent of this was civil, representing about10 per cent of the world market for civil aircraft,3.    The chart at Annex A shows how the market for new aircraft up to 1980is likely to be split.   In practice the various sectors are not sharplydefined.   For example the upper end of the twinjet market overlaps with thelower end of the trijet market.   In the subsonic field we have opted out of long range transports (Boeing 747);   these aircraft and the American trijetswill take some 63 per cent of the market0   The remaining major new class ofsubsonic aircraft, with which this paper is concerned, is the twin enginedshort/medium range aircraft of around 250 seats.   This is likely to take some3
14 per cent of the market &quot;by 1980, progressively replacing existing smalleraircraft such as the Boeing 727 and 737, Douglas DC9 and BAG 111.   This will mean a market for about 1,100 aircraft by 1984.   Below this class a demandmay arise in the later 1970s for a new aircraft of around 175 seats,representing perhaps 5 per cent of the market by 1980.   The French havealready launched the 120/150 seat Mercure (almost certainly too early andwith the wrong engine) which may pre-empt part of the limited market forthis class in the earlier years.   Below these sizes of aircraft, which will represent the main equipment of airlines, there are likely to be about 3sizes of aircraft in the &quot;feeder-line&quot; category with up to 100 seats?Between them these various minor types will represent only some 13 per cent of the market, and this field is already highly competitive,4.     The development and manufacture of later generations of supersonicaircraft after Concorde will almost certainly be dominated by America.V/STOL is not yet a commercial proposition, and may not in the foreseeable future be more than a specialised market because operating costs will be highs  :5.    Thus the &quot;airbus&quot; size of aircraft like the European A300B or the bac 311, with a total world demand estimated at some 1,100 aircraft,represents the sole remaining worthwhile market,which we can bid for if,either alone or in collaboration with other countries, we wish to retain a significant place in the civil subsonic aircraft business.   The market forthis size of aircraft is discussed in more detail at Annex BeTIE AIRCEAJT industry,     Of the total of 240,000 people in the industry, 140^000 are employed bythe 3 major companies -iiHawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) with 31 .,000 employees, whose maincurrant projects are, on the military side, the Harrier to fighter and Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft and on the civil side the Tridentfor BEA and the smaller HS748 and HS125 aircraft.   All 3 civilproduction lines are approaching the end.   HSA are also designing and building major parts of the wings of the A300B, as sub-contractors tothe European airbus consortium.4
British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) with 37,000 employees, whose maincurrent military projects are the Anglo/French Jaguar and the Anglo/German MRCA aircraft.   Current civil projects are the BAC 111, with200 sold but sales now likely to decline, and Concorde.Rolls-Royce with 70,000 employees.   The main civil engines are theSpey, the RB211, and the Olympus 593 for Concorde.   The principal newmilitary project   is the RB199 for the MRCA.7.    Supporting the aircraft industry is an avionics and equipment industryconsisting largely of firms like Smiths, Elliots, Plessey and Lucas who haveextensive interests in other industries, as well as aviation specialistsuppliers like Dowty,8.    By way of comparison, the French aircraft industry now employs about100,000 people, and the German industry 45,000 people, and is growing.9.    On the military side, good progress has been made in establishingcollaborative projects, notably the Jaguar and MRCA.   It has been clear forsome time (and was recognised by the Plowden Committee in 1965) that weshould similarly collaborate with other countries on civil aircraft, to share ever-increasing development costs and to widen the market.   Butcollaborative projects almost inevitably cost more and for civil aircraft in a competitive market the costs and selling price are of acute importance.Secondly, national airlines seek to preserve the greatest possible freedomof choice and cannot be regarded as captive customers.   Thirdly, whereGovernments commit themselves to collaborate on a project, it becomeseasier for industry to avoid the commercial and financial risks;   experience with the Concorde and A300B amply demonstrates this.   Thus, even thoughinternational civil aircraft projects are likely to require government financial support, they ideally emerge in the first place as joint commercialproposals by industry.   All these problems were at the root of our withdrawalin 1969 from the European airbus project, which is discussed further below.5
10.   Successive Governments since the war have invested large sums of money in military and civil projects.   During the last 10 years we have spent orcommitted  74 million in launching aid for civil aircraft (excluding Concordeand the EB211 engine);   we have so far recovered  6 million and hope to recover a further  22 million, mainly on the BAC 111 and tho Spey engine(see Annex E) .   However, Government financial assistance has been providedfor a variety of reasons;   for example, in order to keep BEA flying British,substantial aid was granted for   BAC 111 500s (which at the time were not expected to sell in large numbers elsewhere) and for Trident 3Bs.   The totalforeign currency benefits of sales so far achieved are worth some  650 millionagainst a resource cost which has not been calculated but is probably somewhat higher.11.   Although the industry has achieved large earnings of foreign currency,it cannot be claimed that the civil activities of either tho airframe or theaeroengine firms have paid their way by commercial standards:   notsurprisingly, because the industry&apos;s principal competitors in the USA enjoy the direct benefit of NASA^ aeronautical programme and the indirect benefitof very large military programmes, and in other countries Government subsidyis the rule.   Government support for all but the smallest projects, whetherthey are national or collaborative, is likely to continue to be required,because the scale of expenditure and risk involved is more than the private sector is prepared to shoulder.   This policy has been adopted either directly or indirectly in all countries possessing aircraft industries.   For us itmust continue to be a matter of deciding for each project whether the nationalgains are worth the cost.   To drop out now would mean sacrificing the best chance of sharing in one of the 7rorld&apos;s larger growth industries of the next10 or 20 years.   The specialised technology involved in aircraft and aero-engine design and manufacture is beyond the compass of all but a few countries,so that at home and abroad our chances of retaining a share of the market should remain good.   However, since the costs involved in developing new aircraft and the investment required from Governments are rising steeply,Ministers may wish to consider whether it is worth maintaining even a growthindustry if it must depend, as far as can be foreseen, on Government subsidieswith increasing sums at risk on each venture.6
12,   There is little doubt that collaboration is the right policy in the longer term, since aircraft projects are becoming too expensive for any single country outside America.   It also seems clear that if we wantcollaboration on equal terms it must be with Europe, not America.   In Europe,we can build on links already formed for military projects and Concorde.Whether or not we join it the European Community is going to be one of theindustrial giants of the world, alongside the USA and the USSR, and theirpresent policy is to sustain a major aircraft industry.13,   If we conclude for the reasons discussed in this paper that the A300Bdoes not offer a satisfactory basis for collaboration and decide to supportthe BAC 311, we shall in effect be deferring collaboration with Europe untilthe next round of projects (which may or may not be V/STOL).  Wo may therebymaintain the strength of the industry so that it can collaborate with theEuropean aircraft industries on more equal terms.   On the other hand we may find it more difficult to join a Community effort at a later date.   the europeans may by then have made their own arrangements, with or without the americans.   Indeed, there is a danger that United States/ESC collaborationcould eventually cut us out.14.   Without the BAC 311, our national capacity to design and market majorcivil aircraft, now well established with the BAC 111, is likely to disappear,and on the airfratae side at least we should rank only as junior partners inthe future European industry, particularly in view of current Frenchambitions to dominate it.  We might, as a quid pro quo, try to maintain ourleadership on engines;   but it is by no means clear that a European airframeconsortium would be prepared to buy its engines from a Rolls-Royce led group to the exclusion of rival American engines.   French and German enginecompanies are already proposing to manufacture an American engine under licence for the A300B.   Thus the position of Rolls-Royce may well depend onthe continuance of a strong British contribution on the airframe side.   Thesame argument applies to the avionics industry.II15.   The following paragraphs summarise the proposals made by the firms andtheir prospects.7
BAC 31116.   This 250 passenger aircraft would cone into service in 1975.   It hasbeen devised by the BAC team at Y/eybridge who designed the BAC 111 and have achieved with that aircraft, as with the Viscount before it, a substantialworld reputation.   Work so far has been paid for by the company:   their expenditure to date is about  3 million.   The engine (EB211^l) would be adeveloped version of the RB211-22, the engine in the Lockheed trijet.   Therehas been no expenditure on this version to date.   Alternatively the GeneralElectric CF6 engine could be fitted.17.   Sales would probably lie between 150 and 240, assuming that the A300Balso goes ahead.   This estimate by the Ministry of Technology is based onextensive market surveys and has deliberately been pitched on the cautiousside.   At 240 sales the aircraft would capture about the same percentage ofthe world market (estimated at 1,100) as the BAC 111.   BEA would place an initial order for 20, and need perhaps 60 in total.   Sales prospects areanalysed in some detail in Annex B.18.   Total launching cost of tho aircraft and engine is estimated at 200 million of which Her Majesty1 s Government would have to find  Ihk million(at March 1970 price levels), representing 60 per cent of BACs costs and100 per oent of Rolls-Royce costs.   These estimates have been carefullyvetted by the Ministry of Technology and are considered to be realistic.The sums involved and Her Majesty&apos;s Government *s contribution would be farlarger than those required for earlier projects apart from Concorde.19.   The results of the economic appraisal of the project are set out in annex C.   The figures are slightly different from those given in CP(70) 21,largely because we are now asked to find 100 per cent of the engine costs.Tho principal conclusions are -At 240 Salesa. Government loss/gain (discounted figures in brackets)(- 72 m)- 60 m- 5 n(-- 53 m)b. Foreign exchange benefit (discountedfigures in brackets) 750 m( 335 m) 1,300 m( 500 m)c.

Implied subsidy if RB211-61 engine is alsosold to Lockheedg. Implied preference if RB211-61 engine isalso sold to LockheedNOTES   1. The figures at c. to g. are based on net present value ofexpenditure and receipts discounted at 10 per cent per annum.2. A  50 million overrun in launching costs which could not be recovered by an increase in aircraft or engine selling prices would increase the Implied Preference figures in line e. above to 28 per cent (at 150 sales) and 34 per cent (at 240 sales).3, If Her Majesty&apos;s Government were to contribute an additional 20 million to  meet such a cost overrun without increasing itslevy on sales the Implied Subsidy figures in line d. would beincreased to 26 per cent (at 150 sales) and 14 per cent (at240 sales).20.   Neither firm can afford to offer a higher stake in the project.   Thefinancial outlook of Rolls-Royce, who are already contributing massively tothe costs of the RB211-22, has deteriorated still further since July.   Tocover their 40 per cent share of BAC 311 costs, BAC&apos;s parent companies are planning to subscribe further equity capital and to raise another  12 million by a public offer of loan stock;   under-vyriting arrangements for this sum havenow been successfully made.\\A300B - EUROPEAN AIRBUS21.   This aircraft is close to the BAC 311 in concept and performance.  we withdrew from the project&apos; in 1969 because there was at the time no assurance of airline interest, insufficient financial participation by industry, doubts about the effectiveness of the consortium&apos;s project management and no prospect that the stretched RB211 could be established as the sole engine for theaircraft.   Hawker Siddeloy are, with financial assistance from the GermanGovernment, continuing to develop and manufacture major parts of tho wing.At 150 Sales At 240 Sales21$ 11%22% 10%15% 8%13% 6%9
22.   At the time of our withdrawal, development costs of the A300B (excludingengines) were estimated at some  185 million at 1968 prices of which her Majesty&apos;s Government *s share would have &quot;been about  75 million, assumingHawker Siddeley would have financed all production costs.   In additionHer Majesty1 s Government would have had to finance the lion,s, share of the engine launching costs if a Rolls-Royce engine had been adopted, - This mighthavo meant a further contribution by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of, say 35 million,23.   HSA have now proposed that, instead of launching the BAC 311, we should contribute to the launching of a stretched version of the aircraft, known asthe A300B-7, with the RB211-61 engine.   This version would have slightlylarger fuselage than the present A300B giving it the same seating capacity as the BAC 311;   it could also be powered by the American G-eneral Electricengine (CF6) which will go into the basic A300B.   According to HSA it would cost about  25 million to launch.    HSA believe that the French and G-ermanswould contribute since they will want to offer this size of aircraft anywaywith the General Electric engine.   But a decision to launch the largerversion of the aircraft has not yet been taken.24,   HSA are not prepared to take a share in the launching costs on thegrounds that they are already contributing to A300B costs.   This means thatthe whole United Kingdom cost would fall to the G-government.   Including the 60 million required for the engine, the total would probably lie between 70 million and  90 million, depending on whether the Erench and G-ermansshared the costs,   (it is assumed here that Her Majesty*s Government wouldnot be prepared to share in the launching costs of the A300B-7 for salesolely with the General Electric engine),25,   We believe it unlikely that sales of the Rolls-Royce engined version ofthe A300B would exceed 75-125 (even if BEA bought as many as 60) out of totalA300B sales of perhaps 275.   These estimates take account of our view that the airbus consortium, as a relatively untried team, are unlikely to gain thefull confidence of major world airlines, and that most of the sales will be with the American engine, with which the A300 B is being developed.10
26.   Tho results of an economic appraisal of HSA&apos;s proposal are set out in annex C.   The principal conclusions are -At 75 Sales    At 125 Salesa. Government loss/gain (discounted - 57 n - 47 mfigures in &quot;brackets) (^ 48 m) (- 44 m)&quot;b. Foreign exchange benefit (discounted  75 m  200 nfigures in brackets) ( 26 m) ( 78 m)c.

Implied preference if RB211-61 engine isalso sold to Lockheed 25% 17%NOTE:   The figures are based on not present value of expenditure and receipts discounted at 10 per cent per annum and, of course,would bo worsened by any overrun on costs.ROLLS-ROYCERB211-6127.   This engine is a logical development of the RB211-22 to give a thrustof 50,000 lb.   The launching costs are estimated at  60 million with afurther  11 million to be spent on the application to developed versions ofthe Lockheed TriStar if required.   Rolls-Royce are not at present preparedto contemplate launching RB211-61 for the Lockheed application alone.28. The situation on tho RB211-22 will be reported to Cabinet separately.Lockheed29.   It now seoms likely that the Department of Defense and United Statesbanks will give Lockheed enough money to continue their military programme and the civil trijet L1011, though the situation may not finally clarifybefore the end of the year.11
30.   If (unexpectedly) Lockheed were to fail to solve their financial problems and the TriStar programme collapsed, there would he no immediateuse for the present SB 211-22, in which over  30 million of company money and  2f7 million of G-overnment money has already &quot;been invested.31.   If, as now seems likely, Lockheed secure the TriStar programme withthe help of the &quot;banks and are later able to pursue their plans for adeveloped version of the aircraft they will need a developed version ofthe engine.     The RB 211-61 should meet this need.     If the RB 211-61 isnot available on time, Lockheed would have to turn to General Electric orPratt and Whitney;    sales of the RB 211-22 in the basic aircraft wouldthen suffer.    Although switching to another engine manufacturer fortheir stretched versions 7/ould involve Lockheed in heavy extra costs and delay they are not prepared to confirm a requirement for the -61 atthis stage.    They dare not risk rocking the boat by talking of newventures while they are still negotiating with the banks and Departmentof Defense.BEA&apos;s VIEWS32    BEA&apos;s requirements could be met by -BAC 311 - with a Rolls Royce engine or GE engineA300B-7 - with a Rolls Royce engine or GE engineLockheed TriStar (L1011) - with existing RB 211-22 engineLG10 - with an American engine,\\33.   BEA have already concluded that the BAC 311 with the Rolls Royceengine best meets their requirement;   the BAC 311 has* not been offered to them iiith the GE engine but they believe that this would meet their needs equally well.     Their evaluation of the alternative types is beingcarried forward from day to day but it seems likely that they will prefer the TriStar to the A300B-7.     BEA say that they would not wish to buy the A300B-7 with a Rolls Royce engine;   they do not believe it wouldsell widely to other airlines.12
POSSIBLE COURSES34.   There are 3 main options open to the Government -I    REFUSE LAUNCHING AH) FOR THE BAC 311 and RB211-61II     LAUNCH THE BAC 311 AND THE RB211-61III     COLLABORATE WITH THE FRENCH AND GERMANS IN MUNCHING A version of THE A300B WITH THE RB211-61Other possible courses include -IV    POSTPONE DECISIONS ON THE BAC 311 AND RB211-61V    REFUSE LAUNCHING AID FOR THE RB211-61 AND CONSIDER supporting the BAC 311 WITH THE GENERAL ELECTRIC CF6 ENGINE35.   In the following section of the paper the implications of these various courses are discussed.I.     REFUSE LAUNCHING AID FOR THE BAC 311 AND RB211-6136.   BEA would be left with a choice between the TriStar with RB211-22engines, the Douglas DC10 trijet, or the A3Q0B-7 with General Electricengines, if this aircraft is launched.     They have hitherto preferredthe TriStar but would wish to complete their evaluation of the recentA300B-7 proposals, and appraise Lockheed&apos;s financial position, before reaching a final view.    A large BEA order for the TriStar would be ashot In the arm for Lockheed at a time when they need it most.    Theincreased sales of the RB211-22 would directly enhance the return on her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s investment in that engine,37.   Although this course would avoid public expenditure on what must inevitably be high risk projects, and make resources available for otheruses more likely to produce a commercial return, serious consequences for the aircraft and aero-engine industries would follow.Effect on Aircraft Industry38.   For the reasons described in paragraphs 2-5 above no other majorcivil aircraft project is likely to start for some time to come,    Adecision not to back the BAC 311 would therefore entail the rundown ofthe only design team in Western Europe which has demonstrated its ability13
to sell large modern subsonic civil aircraft for soheduled airlineoperations on a world-wide basis including the USA..     A limited volumeof sub-contracted development and manufacturing work, and perhaps the&quot;beginning of work on STOL, would not suffice to hold the team together on a commercial footing,     HSA have established themselves as sub-contractors on the A300B but our ability to play a significant part inthe development of a future European aircraft industry would be greatlyweakened.Effect on Equipment Industry39.   A major cutback in United Kingdom civil aircraft activity wouldhave adverse repercussions on the competitive position of the aircraft equipment and avionics industry, whose experts are heavily dependent onhaving a substantial home base.     The value of BAC 311 equipment orders on the British industry is estimated at  20 million per annum over15 years, compared with current output of over  100 million per annum.Contraction in equipment industry, as in the aero-engine industry, willadversely affect the United Kingdom cost of defence development and production, at least in the short term, because overhead costs will beless widely spread.     It is impracticable to quantify this effect.Effect on Aero-Engine Industry40.   The major growth sector in the 1970s and 1980s will be in largecivil engines.     Rolls-Royce are seeking to establish their position inthis market with the RB211-22.     But their competitors in America arealready developing larger engines in this class.     Since the possibilitiesof stretching the RB211-22 are limited, Rolls-Royce need the RB211-61 ifthey are to stay in the race and retain the confidence of the big american aircraft firms and world airlines.    Abrupt ending of the RB211 familyat the RB211-22 would make it unlikely that a bid by Rolls-Royce for a major hew aircraft application would ever again be accepted by american aircraft manufacturers.     Furthermore, once Rolls-Royce had lost their capacity to match the Americans vdth large advanced technology engines,their claim to provide a nucleus around which a future European industry could be built would be greatly weakened.14
41.   Experience with the development of the RB211-22, had as it has &quot;been,has provided a basis for development of the RB211-61.     On the other hand it casts doubt on the ability of Rolls-Royce, without additional oapitaland improvements in management, to carry through an operation involving a head-on battle with the powerful American companies, with the knowledge that at least one, General Electric, has opened up a clear lead in time with the development of its CE6-50 engine which is the equivalent of theRB211-61.     In this situation, they can only hope to compete if theRB211-61 has a firm basis in the BAC 311.42.   Without the RB211-61, the Government would have to consider withthe company whether there would be a viable future for them in smallerengines.    Aircraft applications for the sort of engine that might be proposed are at present quite uncertain and launching costs might not bemuch less than those of the RB211-61.     Government aid would still berequired.     The RB211-61 is therefore important to Rolls-Royce&apos;s future.43.   Without further Government support, Rolls-Royce would have to reducegreatly their civil aero-engine business, now worth some  43 million per year in exports.     Since civil sales now bear a major proportion of fixedoverheads, the cost of military (and Concorde) engines would increase as civil sales reduced.II.   LAUNCH THE BAC 311 AND THE RB211-6144.   This course would enable BEA&apos;s firm preference for the BAC 311 tobe met.     Neither the BAC 311 nor its engine (assuming completion of theRB211-22 from which it is closely derived) involve substantial risks in new technology.ii45.   In addition to perhaps  25 million for completion of the BB211-22Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have to find  144 million of the combinedlaunching costs of  200 million plus some  11 million for applicationof the engine in a developed TriStar, or  155 million in all.     The15CONFIDENTIAL
possibility of further requests for aid cannot be excluded if the projectruns into difficulty.     Annual Government payments are shown againstthe general provision which the Ministry of Technology has alreadycontingently earmarked for new projects in the following table -1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1275-7.6  TOTALTotal Provisionfor new projects 16 27,5 35 40 40 naRequired forRB211-22 12.5 12.5 - - - -           25BAC 311/RB211-61 4 22 34 38 27 19        144L1011/RB211-61 - 0.5 2 5 3 0.5        11Notes:   1. The excesses in certain years would have to compete for finance with other claims on the contingency reserve,2, The amount and phasing of the assistance for the RB211-22 areas yet uncertain.46.   The advantages of the project are that -a. it represents our best remaining chance of staying in thecivil aircraft business;   given the same success as the BAC 111 -200 sales or more - it will be a big foreign exchange earner.     sales of the engine in a stretched Lockheed aircraft would be a welcomebonus;b. it sustains the fortunes of BAC and Rolls-Royce, 2 companies which already have a world reputation and which have earned some 400 million in foreign exchange from the export of civil aircraft and aero-engines in the last 5 years;c. it will be an insurance against the possibility that v/e will eventually cancel Concorde - with consequences to the industry whichwould, in the absence of the BAC 311, be catastrophic;d. it will strengthen our position with regard to Europe, wherethe alternative may be French or American domination in civil aircrafte. BEA want this aircraft and believe that it will yield themhigher profits than any alternative aircraft;f. it will yield substantial work for our aircraft equipmentindustry and for Shorts in Northern Ireland.16
47.   Against this is -a. the very large expenditure involved - this v/ould consumevirtually all (and in some years more than) the provision which theMinistry of Technology has already contingently earmarked for new projects, and if the BAC 311 and BB211-6*1 were now supported, assistanceVI ! -&apos;for any other projects which might come forward would, over the period to 1974-75, have in most years to be found from the general contingency reserve on which there will inevitably be many other claims;b, the very high probability that the Government will not recoverits expenditure on the project;c. the high price   (in terms both of Government expenditure and ofthe resources used in development and production) which would bepaid for the foreign exchange accruing from sales;d, even if the project is successful, and sales amount to as muchas 240, there is no prospect of its putting the BAC and Rolls-Roycein a position to dispense with G-overnjient assistance, for future- projects. ,,48.   A decision to back the BAC 311 would be deeply resented in france and  Germany.     It would, of course, be regarded as a vrasteful use ofEuropean resources to build both the A300B and the BAC 311 in directcompetition for the same market.     It would enable the French, if they wished to sour the e.c. negotiations, to argue that we were not reallyinterested in European technical co-operation since ?/e were launching anew, purely national aircraft project after withdrawing from one in collaboration with European industry;   and they would not be inhibitedfrom so arguing by the fact that they did precisely that over the Anglo-French variable geometry project.     Moreover, a decision this autumn tobuild the BAC 311 would also make the reaction in France much worse if welater decided to cancel Concorde unilaterally.     But our bargaining position in the e.c. will not be improved if we show ourselves irresolutein protecting our national interests, and we should not be deterred by french and German views if we are satisfied with the merits of the project,in competition with the A300B, and judge it to be in the long term interestof both ourselves and Europe to launch the aircraft.17
49.   BAG have been active in seeking international collaboration in the bac 311.     Parts of the aircraft are planned to be sub-contracted to canada, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Yugoslavia.    This should help othertrade as well as aircraft sales.     Other aircraft manufacturing business in Romania worth some  50 million nay be dependent on the BAC 311 dealgoing ahead.III. COLLABORATE TffTH THE FRENCH AND GERMANS IN LAUNCHING A &quot;VERSION OFTHE A3O0B WITH THE RB211-6150.   Evaluation of HSA&apos;s proposals for the A300B-7 in the light of what we know today of the progress of the A300B has not disclosed any evidencethat the judgements which led us in 19&amp;9 not   to associate Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment with the A300B (see paragraph 21 above) were unsound.     TheMinistry of Technology still considers that the project involves highertechnical risk than the BAC 311 and that the technical characteristics and operating costs of the aircraft are likely to be uncompetitive with whatthe Americans and BAC can offer.     The programme has slipped and thefinancial commitment of the Government is very much larger than we were contemplating in 19&amp;9.    Evidence of airline interest is unconvincing.Air France have been slow to place an order, and Lufthansa have not yetordered.     The German firm Dornier have just decided to withdraw from the project.51.   Collaboration with the French and Germans could mean either re-entry into the A300B as more or less full partners with the French, German and dutch Governments or acceptance of HSA&apos;s proposals for the A300B-7.52.   The first of these alternatives has virtually nothing to commend it.Both the French and Germans are likely to indicate that they would welcomeour return to the A300B consortium, if only in the hope of seeing usabandon the competing BAC 311.     The precise terms on which they would agree to our participation could, however, only be established by openingnegotiations - which would be unwise unless we were seriously contemplatingresuming collaboration on the project.     But it would be bound to be18
expensive for us.     A300B launching costs are thought likely to exceedsubstantially the original figure of  185 million, at early 19&amp;9 price levels, and in addition to this, according to HSA, the Governments are putting up  300 million to finance production.     The French and german governments have made no bones about the fact that they do not expect to recover their massive investment, which they have justified partly for industrial reasons, and they would not be likely to let us in on easierterms, even though the BEA order would be an extremely valuable prize forthem and the position of the French and German industries relatively tothe British industry would be greatly strengthened by dropping the BAC 311.53*   It would not be possible at this stage in the project, -which hasbeen under way for nearly 18 months, to increase the United Kingdom workshare significantly without incurring extra costs.     Nor would it berealistic to suppose that HSA could be conceded a more important role.Re-entry would do nothing to preserve our civil aircraft designcapability.     Our contribution to; the project would therefore have to bejustified on the grounds that collaboration in this field with the europeans now would bring political and possibly longer-term industrialbenefits.54.   The second alternative viz acceptance of HSA&apos;s proposals for theA300B-7, has some things to commend it -1ia. it would be evidence of our desire to be good Europeans;b. it might encourage collaboration between Rolls-Royce and theFrench and German engine companies, who are at present working withGeneral Electric on the CF6 engine.On the other hand -i.     100 per cent Government financing is involved.     Though the initial outlay would be lower than for the BAC 311, the ultimate costto the Exchequer would be at least as big, and greater if our basicdoubts about the A300B proved to be justified.     The proposal is noteconomically viable (paragraph 26 above);
ii.     even if the A300B-7 is successfully developed, the market fora Rolls-Royce engined version in competition with a variant of theCF6, which will be tho established engine in the basic version, islikely to be limited.     Thus sales of the engine also in a stretchedLockheed aircraft would be essential to avoid financial disasterfor Rolls-Royce;   but adoption of the engine by Lockheed at thisstage is uncertain;iii,     BEA would not willingly buy the Rolls-Royce engined version;iv.     the project might do little to stimulate collaboration in either engine or airframe fields.    Tho French and Germans wouldoontinue to have a direct interest in the General Electric enginethrough their manufacturing arrangements and Rolls-Royce positionin Europe would only be enhanced if the French 7/ere prepared to forego their freedom to exploit the competitive situation which exists between Rolls-Royce and the American engine companies.    Theindustrial benefit to the United Kingdom would be negligible.     Thesubordination of the British civil aircraft industry to the Frenchindustry would be confirmed.The other possible courses can be dealt with more simply -IV.   POSTPONE A DECISION ON THE BAC 311 AND THE RB21155.   Unless interim funding were agreed, this course would run the risk(amounting almost to a certainty) that BAC would withdraw the project;their present intention is to stop work on 30 October if the Governmenthave not by then announced their support.     It would amount to a deoisionby default, to abandon the BAC 311.    Moreover, BEA need an airbus in1975 if they are not to lose out to better equipped competitors, and the bac 311 must go ahead no?/ if it is to meet that timetable.56,   Rolls-Royce do not consider that the RB211-61 would be commerciallyviable without the BAC 311.     If, as seems probable, Lockheed find thefinance necessary to carry through the TriStar programme, they will soonneed to offer customers modest develor)ed versions (extra range and seating20
capacity) without which the project will not achieve its market potential.If the RB211-61 is not available to meet these requirements, Lockheed mustturn to General Electric or Pratt and Whitney.     This would not only killRolls-Royce&apos;s future chancesj   it could hit sales of the RB211-22 in thebasio TriStar.V.     REFUSE LAUNCHING AID FOR THE RB211-61 AND CONSIDER DEVELOPING the bac 311 WITH THE GENERAL ELECTRIC CF6 ENGINE, SHOULD BAC PROPOSE THIS57.   This course would entail the same Government launching aidcontribution of  84 million to the airframe costs as the present BAC 311proposal, but would save the engine launching cost of  60 million.     Themarket forecast for this version of the aircraft would be similar to orslightly higher than that for the RB211-61 version.    Implied preferencesand implied subsidies would also be little changed, the lower foreign exchange benefit being matched by a smaller use of national resources and a smaller loss to Her Majesty1 s Government.     The figures would, ofcourse, depend on the extent of United Kingdom manufacture of the enginethat Rolls-Royce might bo able to negotiate with General Electric.58.   For the reasons discussed above, failure to develop the RB211 familywould almost certainly mean the end of the British aero-engine industry&apos;sattempt to stay in the &quot;big league&quot; and would throw into question its part in any future European aero-engine industry.    Adoption by theUnited Kingdom of the rival General Electric engine would be the clearestpossible admission that Rolls-Royce could not hope to compete.    On theother hand if it were decided that Rolls-Royoe could no   longer be supported at their present level, sub-contract work on the General Electricengine could help to establish them in a new role.    ,(59.   In general, therefore, this course would only be sensible if we attach importance to the maintenance of the civil airframe industry, but arecontent to see Rolls-Royce assuming a reduced world role.21

SALES PROSPECTSSALES PROSPECTS1,      There is general agreement among American and European experts that,although the twins and tri-jets overlap to some extent (BEA, for example, could use either), a world market for about 1100 wide bodies twin-engined aircraft vrildevelop from about 1975 onwards.    The air transport market is doubling every 56 years and, despite the current recession in American traffic growth, all sectcare expected to grow at not less than two thirds of this rate well into the 19:--2.      Density of traffic and airport limitations will dictate the use of highcapacity aircraft to minimise air traffic control problems.    On short mediumrange routes twin-engined aircraft of the airbus type will offer operatingeconomies.    This sector of the market is at present served by some 1600 Boeinfj727s and 737s, Douglas DC9s, BACllls, Tridents and Caravelles.     By 1975 thestandard of passenger comfort in these aircraft vdll be much lower than that ofthe Boeing 74-7 and the new American trijets.    They will also be a good dealnoisier than aircraft designed to comply with new regulations and their usefulfatigue lives will be coming to an end.3.      The BAC3U and A300B are designed to replace these aircraft.     There is as yet no American competitor in the field.     Financial stringency may make itdifficult for any of the American firms to launch a new project at an early datebut given their shorter development and production time-scales they can afford twait several months and still match European delivery dates.     The potential maris so large that there will certainly be American competition.    Nevertheless,the present combination of circumstances is uniquely favourable to the Europeanindustries. 23
4.      Yvhat degree of penetration of the world market can be expected by theBAG311 and A3-0QB respectively?     iVe are bound to assume that American manufacture:will capture the lion1 s share of the market, 70% of which is in the USA.     Thiswould mean sales of say 600 American twins, leaving 500 for the A3003 and 3AC311.Anything less than 400 would be a doubtful commercial proposition for an Americancompany because of their relatively high costs in the labour intensive developreenphase.     If both the A300B and the BAC311 go into development this could wellsqueeze out all but one of the potential American competitors.     On the otherhand if either failed to come up to scratch there would be an adequate market for two American firms.5.      The prospects for the BAC311 are good.     The BAC111 has captured 20% of theworld market in the teeth of competition from both Boeing and Douglas.     Theaircraft has won a very fine reputation, notably with its US airline customers,even though BAC were handicapped by the lack of a suitable version of the rolls royce Spey engine to give them stretch matching that of the 3oeing and Douglasaircraft.     The Ministry of Technology believes that the BAC311 stands a highchance of achieving sales of 240 aircraft by 1982/84.     This represents a marketpenetration of 22%, a little better than the BAC lllfs penetration.-6.      BAC have received letters of intent from 8 airlines including BEA.     the initial requirements of these airlines amount to 43 aircraft and their total requirements should exceed 100 aircraft.     This is a better base than the UKindustry has had for any previous civil aircraft project.7.      For the purpose of the economic assessment a low sales figure of 150 has alsbeen assumed.     Provided thf* aircraft is developed and sold to BEA, followed by anumber of the British independents, it should eertainly cchieve that numlcr.     EveBAC&apos;s competitors, HSA and Lockheed, concede BAC311 sales of 140-200 and 150respectively in their market assessments.-    24CONFIDENTIAL
8.       Given competition from the BAC311 and one imierica.n firm the Ministry of technology estimates that sales of the A300B stand a good chance of reaching 175by 1984.     In the absence of the BAC311 but retaining the generous assumption of only one American competitor sales might reach 275.     Air France, probably underpolitical pressure, have issued a letter of intent to purchase and Lufthansa areexpected to follow suit before the end of the year.     Their total requirement woulslightly exceed the numbers required by BEA and the British independents.Political factors could enable the A300B to sell in Western Europe at the expenseof the BAC3H.     On the other hand the A3O0B1 s chances of penetrating the Araericr-nmarket are very small.     Airbus Industrie cannot match the experience of eitherBAC or the American aircraft firms in selling and servicing modern airlinersthroughout the world and particularly in the USA.119.      HSA and Airbus Industrie claim much better prospects.     Assuming nocompetition from the BAC311 they forecast 400 sales of all versions of the A3003.The minimum of 140 sales which they are prepared to concede to BAC would presumablybe mostly at the A300B&apos;c expense.10.     The A300B-7 with the RB211-61 engine does not have good sales prospects.HSA forecast 160 with another 40 sales of the basic A300B fitted with theRB211-61.     44 of these sales are attributed to BEA.     A big drawback with theR3211-61 version of the A300B-7 is that it would be offered in competition with i.version powered by a variant of the General Electric CF6 engine which has alreadybeen adopted as: the basic fit for the aircraft.     The Ministry of Technologyestimate is that if BEA were constrained to buy the A300B-7, against their choice,sales might amount to 75-125.11.     The basic version of this engine, the RB211-22, is sold in the LockheedTriStar.     Although the sales prospects of this aircraft may have heim hit byLockheed&apos;s financial difficulties and a certain lo&quot;3 of confidence among airlinos,the aircraft continues to hold its own in competition with the basic version of25. :      Ulm
the Douglas DC10 and if the programme is successfully completed it should sell aminimum of 200-225.     Current orders and options amount to 144- . The postiony/ould, however, be considerably improved if BEA and other British airlines bought:the TriStar.     Total orders for the basic version might then amount to 275*    Someairlines will only buy the basic aircraft if there is the promise of developedversions coming alongj   if Lockheed cannot promise this they will turn to Douglas.12.     The RB211--6I would be offered-for developed versions of the TriStar.    Stretchis likely to take either or both of 2 forms viz extended range or increased seatingcapacity.     Plans for development are uncertain at present time because ofLockheed&apos;s financial difficulties.     But once Lockheed turn the corner the availability of developed versions will greatly enhance the prospects of the project.     We should therefore plan to make the RB211-61 available if possible.Although Lockheed could turn to General Electric or Pratt and Whitney if theR3211-61 is not available this would increase costs and lead to delay so they arelikely to continue to favour Rolls Royce.13.     There is considerable uncertainty about the market for developed versions,and Lockheed&apos;s future activities.     Sales could amount to 200 but for thepurpose of the economic appraisal a conservative figure of 100 (36O engines) hasbeen used.14-.     The RB211 should find other applications than aircraft, notably in marinevessels.     Rolls Royce forecast 150 sales of versions of the RB211-22 and 100-200RB211-6ls.     These are not included in the economic appraisal.

29LAB GUI-: IMPLICATIONS1.      BACs present total labour force is about 37*000.     The firm estimate thatthe BAC311 will occupy some 2,500 of their employees by the end of 1971, rising to a peak of about 9,000 by the mid 1970*s.2,      Current employment at V.:eybridge on the BAC3H is about 500.     A decision not to proceed would accordingly have only a small effect on local unemploymentimmediately:   on present plans, work on Concorde production will progressivelyabsorb labour becoming available as BAC 111 work dies away.3.      If the BAC311 does not proceed and the Concorde is eventually cancelledmajor redundancies will be unavoidable at Y.reybridge, Hurn and Filton.     The. BAC31Iwould substantially reduce the industrial difficulties involved if for any reason the Concorde is discontinued at a later date.4.      BACs military aircraft and guided weapons work&apos;is largely separatephysically and would Trot be greatly affected if the BAC311 did not go ahead.5*      Rolls Royce&apos;s present total labour force on aero-engines is about 70,000.The RB211-22 will employ some 20,000 people at peak in 1971.     The RB211-61 wouldemploy some 1200 by the end of 1971 rising to 9-15,000 (depending on whetherLockheed order as well as BAC) by the mid-1970&apos;s.6.      If the RB211-61 does not go ahead, Rolls Royce will need to accelerateredundancies among staff engaged in engineering and experimental manufacture.They would shed 1500 men by the end of 1971, and some 5,000 by the end of 1974.Production manpower would not decline seriously until 1974.
7.       The BAC311 is expected to provide large sub-contracts to Shorts in NorthernIreland and to Scottish Aviation at Prestwick.     The work at Shorts would s&apos;engage labour foi^ce of 1300 at peak in the mid seventies.8. Hawker Siddeley&apos;s design and manufacturing work on the wing of the A300B isexpected to employ a peak labour force of about 1800 in the mid seventies.30
