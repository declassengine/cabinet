THIS DOCUMENT   IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S government cp(70) 71 COPY no. 5 October 1970CABINETINVESTMENT INCENTIVESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet on 1 October invited me to reconsider my proposals for investment incentives set out in CP(70) 66 from four points of view -i. It was suggested that the transitional period for the with-drawal of investment grants from shipping might cover three years from the date of announcement rather than two years as proposed in cp(70) 66.     I can see force in this.     The only drawback is thatit would reduce the savings by an estimated  40 million in 1973-74 and 20 million in 1974-75*     Bearing in mind some of the decisions which we have taken to secure smaller savings, I would regret thisbut, if it were considered to be necessary to help to secure the aquiescence of the shipping industry to the withdrawal of grants and the tax treatment proposed, I would not oppose it.ii. It was suggested that the proposed transitional arrangements should be reconsidered generally with a view to providing that grants should be withdrawn from the date of the announcement, except forcases where contracts had been entered into before the date of announcement.     I think that if we had such an arrangement we shouldhave to provide a cut-off period of one year.     Otherwise I am advised that it could well prove more costly than the year&apos;s warningproposed in CP(70) 66.    I think that,we need to consider thefollowing points -1
a. It will be for the Minister of Technology, to justifywhatever we decide to Parliament and industry and to deal withany complaints or criticisms from the Public Accounts Committee(PAC) the Parliamentary Commissioner or from other quarters.I attach a note on the administrative considerations with whichhe has provided me.     It seems to me that there is a good deal of force in the points made.b. There is no means of estimating how much would be saved by adopting the oontracts basis. But it seems probable that mostof the capital investment (in value terms) ^Mch will be paid for over the next 12 months will already have boon contracted for.The main source of saving will be the elimination of thescope for forestalling by bringing investment forward whichwould exist under the original proposal.    It is difficult toarrive at any precise figures for thi3.    The best estimate wecan make is that, assuming  50 million of forestalling, theExchequer would save  15 million in grants and tax allowances in 1972-73 and that  11 million of this would be reflected in increased tax allowances in the years 1973-74 to 1975-76.c. Arrangements on the contracts basis would provide morescope for argument and irritation than the more cut-and-driedbasis of 12 months&apos; notice,d. It we accept the case for a three-year cut-off period for shipping it might be difficult to justify no more than a one-year cut-off period generally.     This problem would be lessacute if the general transitional arrangements and those for shipping were on a quite different basis,  (iOn balance I think it would be best to stick to the arrangements proposed in CP(70) 66.2
iii.    It was suggested that the form of the proposed regionaldifferential should be altered by restricting free depreciation to manufacturing industry instead of extending it to the service sectoras well and by using the resultant Exchequer savings to increasegrants and loans under the Local Employment Acts and expenditureon infrastructure in the development areas.     As I have already pointed out, this might appear somewhat illogical and out of line withthe Government&apos;s general policy to abolish discrimination betweenmanufacturing and service industry in the country generally hut toretain it in the development areas.    The construction industry inthe development areas would feel particularly harshly treated.I would personally therefore favour sticking to my original proposal.But this is very much a matter for the judgment of my colleagues with regional responsibilities.     There seems little doubt that itwould be possible to find ways of spending effectively the 25 million a year or so which the proposal would save.     I appenda note setting out possible proposals.iv.    Finally, it was suggested that the proposed overall savings to the Exchequer were inadequate and represented unduly generoustreatment for industry in contrast with the more rigorous treatmentproposed for the shipping industry and of the social services.     Iam of course very conscious of the importance of holding a reasonable balance between on the one hand the economic need to encourage and facilitate investment by maintaining an adequate level of companyliquidity and the desirability of retaining the confidence ofindustry by treating it in a manner which will be generally accepted as reasonable;   and, on the other hand, the need to secureExchequer savings as a basis for reducing the burden of personaltaxation.     I put my proposals forward in CP(70) 66 as holding a fair balance between these considerations.     Since then I have agreed tocertain additional expenditure in the Social Service field whichshould certainly help with the presentation of the balance.The fact is that, under the proposals in CP(70) 66 most manufacturingcompanies will be worse off in terms of their cash flow and I would be reluctant to make the situation for those companies even more difficult.A treasury Chambers SW15 October 19703

In viewof the work of the Bolt on Committee,  and the reference in the Conservative manifesto, this would be unfortunate3      &apos;I&apos;he Government would also be open, to the damagingcharge iron industry, ana particularly from those firms,large or snail, who fail to prove contracts for normal and legitimate business, that it does not 1 understand,or does not care, how industry works. - In particular,even a scheme for continuing to pay grant on expenditure incurred under contracts existing at the cut-off date would not deal satisfactorily with allcases of hardship since there will be firms withcommitments for which formal contracts do not exist,eg. on self-built assets, long-term projects whichare contracted for by stages etc.    who arrangement would tans t, n;ite arbitrary in its effect,    this wouimake it ail the more difficult to defentiwhat would necessarily he an elaborate exemption procedure,    mhemore rigorous cur administration was, the greater .y;oulobe the criticism. -* &apos;    wGOVhlahihh- ill .I;aS&apos;.^:ArICi4      hsuaily the handling of the documents by sheInvestment  rants Offices would be a very large task.?or each item the Office would haVe the duty of docidi.whether a contract existed and, if so, its effectivedate.

To ascertain thelegal position in each case would constitute a formidabledifficulty.    The executive staff of the investment grants Offices are not legally qualified, and even ifthey carried&apos;cut seme sifting under instructions drawnup by the legal advisers, the number of doubtful cases to be considered, and argued, by the legal advisersthemselves would be bey end their resources.5      We have considered whether it-would be possible toshift the burden of this legal work entirely on tolawyers in private practice by providing that        &apos;   *applicants must support their claims with a solicitor&apos;scertificate that in his opinion a contract existed onthe relevant date.    V/e would assume that all but a tinynumber of certificates would be given with proper&quot;professional diligence and in good faith, and v/e would go behind them only in exeeptional oases of suspicion, his system, if feasible, would remove practically allthe administrative difficulties for the Government, bytransferring them to others.    The cost and paper work-falling on industry would be substantial, and would give Irise to very strong criticism.    We do not know whotm.:rsolicitors would, be wcrrisd about possible conflict of interest and liability for negligence, or indeed,-3-
(sec ret)whether the profession could manage the work without undue delay,    the Law Society would presumably haveto be approached, and the At uorney General would be concerned.6       the ministry do not consider that it would be consistent - with their responsibility for accounting forthe expenditure of public money to operate transitional arrangements of this kind simply by accepting a flrrabsword that particular items of expenditure had been incurred under a contract entered into before a givenevendate,/if this wore combined with checks in the form of requests for documentary evidence in a sample of cases,the scope fqr fraud and the sums involved are so great that they could not defend running this risk.7       Ih any case, if we let it be known that we shouldselect a random sample of cases for rigorousinvestigation to ascertain whether an applicant&apos;o claim that a contract existed, it is doubtful whether the;-Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration would besatisfied that it was not maladministration todiocriv.iir.ato in a way which would put many firms toexpense end trouble while the majority escaped scrutiny. ,    .;...,..,....

irnra^caiju^iwn^^ -enThe Inu&quot;pftsiLa2^ men of long training and special experience, which our Investment Grants staff are not.   -They have the advantage of seeing all theoperations of a firm reflected over she years in itsaccounts which are nor open to our staff.    They have access also so the accounts of suppliers and associated companies.  &apos; They have, we understand,  some flexibility in that they are required to secure a satisfactoryposition overall between the Government and a taxpayer,whereas we are liable to have to justify each paymentindividually to the Tuolic Accounts Committee.Finally, the existence of about 70.0 tax offices makespossible some variation of practice from case to case which we cannot risk with our much more centralisedarrangements,,   It is, we think, for these reasons thatthe Inspectors were able to deal with the problem of contracts in 1956 and 1955, with only occasionalreference to headquarters and to the lawyers.9      It would, however, be no solution to the problem at present under discussion to shift the burden ofcertifying that the relevant contracts existed fromthe ministry of Technology to the Inland lie venue, whoare already short of trained staff.SHIPS10     As explained in paragraph 19 of C?(70)66,  it isadministratively feasible in the case of ships to relate the transitional arrangements to specificcontracts.    The cases are relatively few and, formal
contracts exist in nearly all cases, thus the documents are likely to &quot;be readily available and in noorder.11     To adopt the course suggested would not necessarilead to much saving in public expenditure as comparedwith a year!s notice.    The data are not availableto provide any realistic estimate.   But much 01 theexpenditure incurred lor many months after theannouncement would be genuinely covered by contracts and would have to be approved for grant.    Some not socovered would, because of the administrative problems,nevertheless, get by.    It.is thus reasonable to suppose that only a small part of the payments which would havbeen made on expenditure incurred during the period of notice wculd...be saved by adopting the suggestion underdiscussion.
.DETOOPMENT A EE A FACILITIESNote by OfficialsThis note discusses additional measures of assistance to theDevelopment Areas which could be introduced if it were decided to allocate  20- 25m a year for the purpose as a result of limiting free depreciation in the Development Areas to manufacturing industry.    Itdeals first with assistance under the local Employment Acts for new projects or local expansions which provide additional jobs, then withtraining and finally with infrastructure.    It also considers therelevance to these proposals of recent Ministerial consideration of thequestion of a winter works programme.   The estimates given below assumeno change in the present boundaries of the Development Areas and thepedal Development Areas and fwould of course be affected if these werelater changed.   The measures discussed below relate only to theDevelopment and Special Development Areas and do not cover the intermediate areas which will require separate consideration,OCAL EMPLOYMENT ACTS*  ffiZ^ai^^IS   The Present rates of building grant are 25  with ahigher rate of 35$ for incoming projects in the Special Development Aresand in the Development Areas as a whole.   The Ministry of Technologyrecently advanced a proposal that these rates should be increased to 30&apos;;nd 40$ respectively at an estimated additional cost of  5m to  6m afte:few years.   They consider an increase in the rates of building grant the simplest and most practicable way of providing more assistance to manufacturing industry under this legislation.   An increase to 35$ andrespectively would cost an additional  10m to  12m after a few year1
3,  At present operational grants aro made for a period of 3 yearstowards the general operating coots of incoming projects in theSpecial Development Areas.   Thoy are calculated on a formula relatingto the capital costs of the project not of building and investment grants and it v4.ll therefore   bo necessary to change the method of calculation when investment grants cease.   The essence of the grantis that it provides a iseans of giving an-additional each benefit which is not tied to building eostse4,   We have considered whether a grant of this kind, not tied to building costs, could be extended to incoming projects in theDevelopment Areas ao a \?hole6   ffv?o possibilities considered have boons-1.   to provide the grant as a percentage (say, 20$) of the wage bill for the first 3 vears of each project.   (Thiseould oost an additional  10a after a period of years.)i2, to pay a percentage grant of the plant and machinery-coots of projects qualifying for building grants - thegrant to be employment related by applying coot per joblimits.    (She cost ^ould depend on the rate of grant and the coot per job limits applied, but could bo substantial.)5.   The Ministry of Technology do not consider that they could operateeither of these proposals.   Serious practical difficulties would arise on the first proposal in distinguishing between now and expand!s$projects, and, in the case of the plant and isachinery granto,establishing the link between the grant and the employment provided.
In addition the Ministry consider that a scheme on either basisproposed would introduce an undesirable complication into the range ofand lndus.tr,Local Employment Act assistance available, both for Government/andthat it would be preferable to provide additional assistance throughbuilding grants.   Under the first proposal there would also be anunjustifiable increase in the differential for incoming projects which in total provide only about a quarter of additional employment.There is also the objection that the future shape of the assisted area and regional policy generally has still to be determined and it wouldbe unwise for the Government to tie themselves at this stage to thiskind of innovation.MOTAC LOANS6,   Loans under the Local Employment Acts are at present restrictedboth by the cost per job limits and by a ceiling of 50^ on the total public sector contribution to the cost of the project.    Liquidityproblems can be expected to arise for some manufacturinging firms onthe withdrawal of investment grants.   One means of easing these forfirms with expansion projects would be to relax the 50^ ceiling incases where the project is basically viable but would otherwise be postponed.   The cost might be of the order of  5m.iiCOST PER JOB LIMITS7.   It is proposed to bring up to date, taking account of the changein the value of money, the cost per job limits applied to loans and grants under the Local Employment Acts.   The effect of these limits isto scale down the total amount of assistance provided if the amountper job created would otherwise be excessive.   It is only in a limited
number of caoes that these limits bite. The cost of this measuretoulcl be  J- l a a year, and it is recommended that this administra.tj.TeI proposal be acted upon in any case.[RAINING8, The Department of Employment and Productivity have put forward proposals for additional expenditure of  0.5m a year on training theunemployed.   Of this amount,  0.1m would be-involved in a schemespecifically designed for the training of unemployed In Developmentli va a i)some part of the rest of the  0.5m might also be spent in therelopraent Areas.   We recommend that these proposals should in anycase be adopted.   The amount of additional expenditure on training inthe Development Areas is necessarily limited by practical considerationsuhich restrict the extent to which facilities can be expanded in theimmediate future, but the new initiatives proposed have considerablepotential for expansion if they are well received by industry.INPRASTRDCTURESection 7 of the Local Employment Act 1960 makes provision for thepayment of grant for the improvement of basic services.    This is part of the wider field of public expenditure on infrastructure.Payment of these grants entails addition to the PESO programmesconcerned - eg water, sewerage, road3.   If Ministers wish to encourage the improvement of certain basic services in the Development Areasmore and larger grants could be made.   To the extent that thisincreases programmes additional public expenditure will be involved.Specific and cost effective proposals for additional expenditure on
infrastructure programmes in the Development Areas cannot, however,be put forward at short notice.    In general, infrastructure programme are of a long term character and arc likely to involve large amountsif they are to have any significant impact.   Moreover in the presentsituation there is a problem over considering additions to infra-structure expenditure by central Government Departments and localauthorities at a time when the immediate effort has been to determinesavings in these programmes.   Looking ahead, Ministers will need toconsider to what extent the Governments emphasis on infrastructureas an instrument of regional development should be reflected in a preferential allocation to the Development Areas within unchangedtotal programmes, or to what extent there should be a special additionfor.the Development Areas oh top of the programmes as otherwisedetermined.   Consideration is being given to infrastructure matters in the review of regional policy.    Subject to detailed considerationprojects (involving consultations with, for example, local authoritieit would be possible to use any balance of the  20- 25m not taken upby those of the measures discussed, above which Ministers decide toadopt, on increasing the basic services programmes for which Sectiongrants are available.CLEARANCE OF DERELICT LARDId Grants are payable under various Acts for the clearance of derelictland.   The rate in Development Areas is 85$;    and in some cases theeffect of rate support grant could bring this up to 95$ or more.Local authorities are already heavily engaged in reclamation:    theallocation has been increased this year to  3m, and plans are in hand for increasing it further.   It is unlikely that there will bo scope i
a significant increase on existing allocations.    The possibility of extending these grants to private owners of land will need furtherconsideration; but we&apos; think that the effect on the overall programme is not likely to be great.WINTER UNEMPLOYMENT11.   At their meeting on 28th September, Economic Policy committee decided against a winter works programme on the lines of thoseorganised in the previous three winters, but invited the Ministerof State, Ministry of Housing and Local Government, to arrange for officials to report urgently on providing an extra  6 million underthe Local Employment Acts for worthwhile projects which would relieve unemployment during the forthcoming winter in Scotland, Wales andthe Northern Region.12.    This however needs to be considered in relation to a Ministerialdecision about possible additional expenditure under the local employment Acts and its probable phasing.    If such measures areannounced now, they will have some effect immediately, althoughalmost certainly not on short term winter unemployment rates.Although there will be a delay before the full effects are felt,nevertheless there will be some expenditure in the first year andit will start to build up thereafter, while the flow of investmentgrant payments will for the time being continue without interruption,both because the grants are in any case paid a year or more in arrearsand because of the further time lag introduced by the proposedtransitional arrangements in the scheme for changing the investment incentives.   Thus, if Ministers announce the immediate introduction ofthese Local Employment Acts measures, they will have the effect ofincreasing for the time being the total package of investment incentive!in the I6 I
;i f&apos;V k- !j if   :;&apos; ^ &apos;i*,B  Si if &quot; \ 8Dsvelopment Areas.   In these circumstances Ministers will wish toconsider whether officials should continue with the remit from EPCSUMMARY OP MAIN PROPOSALS-1.   If it were decided to allocate  20- 25m a year for additional assistance to the Development Areas under the Local EmploymentActs, and through training schemes, the following measures could be adopted1,    Increase building grants to 35$ and 4-5$ (additional cost  10- 12m. ) or to 30% and 4$ (additional cost  5-6m.)lie   Revise cost per job limits for LEA assistance(additional cost  1- 1.5m).iii.   Relax restrictions on MOTAC loans (additional cost  5m).iv. Expansion of basic services programmes qualifying for grant under Section 7 of the 1960 Act (additional cost to relate to the balance available within the  20- 25m)0v. Expansion of DEP scheme for the training of theunemployed (additional cost in the Development Areas  0.1minitially).2,   There are practical and policy objections to extension ofthe operational grant, or variants of it,to the development areas generally.Ministers should be aware that adoption of the proposal toincrease the rates of building grant would involve legislation toamend the Local Employment Acts*xJ ii \j i BM t.;- s \l S I     L
