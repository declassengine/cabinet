INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BILL:    DRAFT CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENTT:   introduction.    The Government has made clear its intention to introduce a comprehensiveIndustrial Relations Bill during the present session of Parliament,2.    This document sets out the principles on which the Government proposes thatthe Bill should he based, and the main provisions which it proposes to include.It is intended to serve as a basis for consultations with the Trades UnionCongress and the Confederation of British Industry;    the Government wishes to start these consultations without delay.   The Government will also welcomecomments from other interested organisations and individuals.    Details of whereto send these comments, and of how to obtain further copies of the document, willbe found at the end.3.    The improvement of industrial relations is of great importance both froman economic and from a social point of view.    Poor industrial relationsadversely affect output, raise industrial costs, damage the balance of payments,and inhibit industrial investment.   They also restrict people1s opportunities of finding satisfaction in their work, and create avoidable conflicts andhostilities in the workpl8.ee and in society as a whole.   They dissipate theenergies of management and unions alike, which are needed for more constructivepurposes.k*    Poor industrial relations are not to be equated simply with strikes.   they include many other kinds of failure in human relations in employment.   the remedies are primarily the responsibility of management, in whose hands rests theinitiative for any improvements that the circumstances may permit.5.    Strikes are, however, often an important symptom of poor industrial relations.And they can make poor industrial relations still worse, particularly.when agreedprocedures for resolving disputes are ignored, or when one group&apos;s pursuit of itssectional interests leads to conflict with other employees.   Unions and employeeshave a responsibility, as well as management, to see that their actions aredirected towards securing and maintaining good industrial relations./6.   Whatever
confidential.    Whatever changes are made, the present widespread shortcomings of industrial relations in Britain cannot be expected to disappear overnight.   But they will notdisappear at all unless managements, and the representatives of employees,intensify their efforts to identify and resolve the problems that arise betweenmanagements and employees.   The improvement and strengthening of machinery for negotiation and consultation, for example, is crucial.   Where such efforts havebeen forthcoming, substantial improvements in industrial relations have been secured.7.     For its part, the G-overnment will continue to. encourage progress towardsbetter industrial relations by the example it sets as an employer and by the help and encouragement it can give through its specialist services which provideadvice and conciliate in disputes.8.     But more is required.   G-overnment has a responsibility to make clear the standards to which, on behalf of the country as a whole, it expects the conductof industrial relations to conform, to establish safeguards for the individual and the community, and to provide the means for resolving disputes over themachinery of industrial relations and the behaviour of the parties to it.   Theproposed Industrial Relations Act will be the Government&apos;s main instrument in achieving these objectives.9.     The Government therefore sees the proposals set out for comment in this document as complementary, and essential, to a continuing and necessarily long-term exercise in the reform and improvement of human relations in the factory,shop, and office.   They are not and cannot be an immediate or self-sufficientsolution to our problems of deteriorating industrial relations.   Nor are theproposals framed vdth any wish to encourage litigation about industrial relationsquestions as anything but a last resort.   But the Government believes that legislation has an essential and positive role to play in the improvement ofindustrial relations;    that the clear statement of fundamental rights and obligations in this field, in what will be the first comprehensive IndustrialEelations Act that this country has ever had, will itself help to persuademanagements and unions towards fairer and more constructive methods of conducting their relations and resolving their differences./10.   Thus the
10.   Thus the improvement of industrial relations in Britain can only besecured by collective effort on the part of Government, managements, unions and employees within a new framework of law which:(i)   sets national standards for good industrial relations;(ii)    safeguards those who conform to them;(iii)   protects individual rights in employment;    and(iv)   provides new methods of resolving disputes over the conductof industrial relations .11.   It is against this background that the proposals which follow should beseen.II.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES12.   It may be useful to set out at once the principles that the Governmentregards as fundamental.   They are:(i)   That every individual should have a right to join a trade union andparticipate in trade union activities, and an equal right not to do soc(ii)   That workers, where they so wish, should have the right to negotiatecollectively, through their trade union or unions, with theiremployer.(iii)    That the worker should be free to withdraw his labour, subject onlyto the requirements of his individual contract of employment,(iv)   That employers and their associations, and trade unions and their members, should have clearly defined rights and obligations towardseach other, and obligations towards the general public, in theconduct of industrial relations;    and that there should be clear,fair and readily available ways of securing those rights andenforcing those obligations.// &quot;     li   &apos; &apos;/III.   INDUSTRIAL
TTI.   INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS PRACTICE13.   It is proposed that the Secretary of State should be required, withina year from the passage of the legislation, to prepare and lay beforeParliament a Code of Industrial Relations Practice.   The objectives and thepurposes of the Code would be to:a. encourage the development of free and responsible collective bargaining, in which each party recognises and respects the legitimate rights and objects of the other;b. encourage the establishment, within undertakings, of effective meansof information and communication between management and workers atall levels so as to involve them mere fully in the operations oftheir firms;c. encourage and promote the development and observance of orderly and peaceful procedures for resolving differences between employersand unions, without damaging the public interest, and taking full advantage of the facilities for conciliation and advice provided -by the Secretary of State and others;d. promote the freedom and security of individual workers;   ande. develop trade unions and employers&apos; associations as representative,responsible and effective bodies for conducting relations between employers and workers .14.   All those concerned with industrial relations would be expected to conform to the Code.   It would not be directly enforceable, but ir any proceedings before-the proposed National Industrial Relations Court or -yic industrial Tribunals(see Part IY)-compliance or non-compliance with it could be adduced in support orrebuttal of the case put forward by either party.   If the Court or Tribunalfound that any person had complied or failed to comply with the Code, inrelation to the matter at issue, it would take that into account in determiningany liability or compensation./IV.   STATUTORY ACENCIES4rQMJFiDFNTIAJ
IV.   STATUTORY AGENCIESIVa. The National Industrial Relations Court and the Industrial Tribunals:Structure15.   The Government proposes to establish a new system of adjudication for industrial relations matters consisting of courts specially suited, bytheir composition and experience, to deal with such matters.   This would have as its higher level a new National Industrial Relations Court (NIRC) of equivalent status to the High Court and as its lower level the present industrial Tribunals (iTs)    which would be given new functions and considerably expanded to deal with the additional work.16.   It is intended that access to the NIRC and the ITs should be easy andtheir proceedings relatively informal that they should include people withspecialist and practical experience of industrial relations on both sides of industry, with a lawyer as chairman;   and that they should be able toapply their practical experience to the matters that come before them.17.   The NIRC would thus consist of a President and other High Court judges and &quot;lay&quot; members with relevant industrial relations experience.18.   The NIRC would be able to sit in more than one division and in various parts of the country,   ill though it would probably be based in London, itwould normally sit at appropriate regional and local centres if that would\ \meet the convenience of the parties.19.   There would be a right of appeal from the NIRC on appoint of law tothe Court of Appeal (in Scotland to the Court of Session) .,/lVb/iVb:   NIRC and ITs: Jurisdiction5
IVb: NIRC and ITs: Jurisdiction^20.   It is the Government&apos;s intention that generally speaking, legal casesabout industrial relations matters should be heard only by the new NIRC,and on some matters the ITs.   The NIRC and the ITs would therefore have jurisdiction in respect of any proceedings about:a. the inducement of, or any threat to induce, a breach of contract in contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute;b. any of the unfair industrial actions mentioned in these proposals(see next paragraph);p.     any breach of a legally enforceable collective agreement;d. any infringement of a contract between trade unions or between a trade union and its members;e. any infringement of rights to be secured by the legislation orany action ir. relation to which a remedy is expressly created by the legislation;f. the matters for which the ITs are responsible at present21.   The Government proposes that a number of actions by employers, employers associations, trade unions and others involved in industrial relations, whichit considers to be seriously contrary to the standards which should be observed in the conduct of industrial relations, should be &quot;unfair industrial actions&quot;.Each is mentioned at the appropriate place in this document.   Anyone claiminghe had been injured, or was threatened with injury, as a result of an unfairindustrial action directed against him would be able to bring a complaint in theNIRC or ITs, which would be able to grant any of the remedies proposed inparagraph 29.   Where it would be an unfair industrial action to organise astrike or lock-out for a particular purpose, it would also be an unfair action.to threaten a strike or lock-out for that purpose;- to organise or threaten any other concerted industrial action forthat purpose;- to put pressure for that purpose, by industrial action or the threat of it, on an employer not himself a party to the dispute.22.   The general principle governing the distribution of functions betweenthe ITs and the NIRC would be that issues which involved an individual would bedealt with by the ITs whilst collective issues (eg about legally enforceable/collective6
collective agreements) would be decided by the NIB.C,    However, there would be provision for individual cases which were expected to be long or complex,  or which had important wider implications to be transferred from the ITs to theNIRC.23.   The NIRC would take over the present responsibilities of the High   court and the   Court of Session in Scotland for appeals from the Industrial Tribunalon points of law - except those under the Industrial Training Act and (forthe present) the Selective Employment Payments Acts./IVc17
IVc:   NIRC and ITs:    Procedure and Remedies/24,   It is proposed that the procedure of the NIRC and ITs should be asinformal and free from technicalities as possible.   They would of course givereasons for their decisions, which would be in as simple a form as possible.Power would be taken   to lay down rules of procedure for the NIRC by statutory instrument.^25.   As in the Industrial Tribunals at present (and also the present industrial court), parties to cases would be allowed to be represented by lawyers or byother persons (pg trade union officers) or to represent themselves as they wished.26.   There would be a discretionary power to award costs, but only when the NIRCor IT considers that the party concerned has acted frivolously or vexationsly,or in appeals and comparable cases, had no reasonable grounds for bringing thecase.27.   The NIRC and ITs would have power to require the attendance of witnessesand the disclosure of documents, and to hear evidence on oath.,/28    The NIRC and ITs would be required to afford opportunities for conciliationbetween the parties before a case was heard.   Information given or obtained inthe course of conciliation and the positions taken by the parties duringconciliation, would not be admissible as evidence in the proceedings.^,/29o   The NIRC and the ITs would be able:- to award compensation\ V  :&apos;:&apos;- to determine the rights of a party! i- to make speedy but temporary orders- to make orders to refrain from unfair industrial action the NIRC would have power to enforce any of these orders.In the Government1 s view, the NIRC and ITs should never grant an interimremedy (ie what is at present described as an ex parte injunction) that wouldrestrain industrial action, without giving those who would be affected anopportunity to put their case.   Such a remedy would not be granted before theNIRC had given any registered trade union   or employers&apos; association thatappeared to it to be directly concerned an opportunity to put its case.8 ^COMF1 DENTS A!
931&apos;.   The NIRC would have power to enforce its own decisions.   Orders ofthe ITs would be enforced through the NIRC, rather than through the county courts as at present.   But the collection of debts arising out ofcases inthe NIRC and the ITs would continue to be a matter for the County Courts.32.   It is proposed that the ITs should be given a limited power to review their decision if fresh facts come to light./iVd
I\Mt The Commission on Industrial Relations33,  The Commission on Industrial Relations (CIR) would continue as at present to be primarily concerned to assist employers and unions in the voluntary reform of industrial relations institutions and procedures.   But it is proposed to give it the additional functions indicated in Parts VII and VIII of these proposals,and to put it on a statutory basis (at present it is a Royal Commission).34.  The Secretary of State would continue to be responsible for appointing theChairman and members, and he (alone or with other Ministers) would initiatereferences (apart from those initiated by the NIRC under the proposals in PartsVII and VIII).35.  The CIR would be enabled to hold such inquiries as it considers necessary or desirable for the performance of its functions, to examine witnesses on oath;to hear evidence in private if this is requested and if it thinks fit; to requirepeople to attend, or to produce documents or furnish information relevant to the inquiry; and to conduct ballots.36. The CIR would be enabled to take any steps it thinks fit to help to remedy the defects which it finds in existing arrangements.37.   The CIR would make a report to the Secretary of State or other ministers who had initiated a reference.38.  The CIR would be required to make an annual report to the Secretary of state on its activities.   This would include a general review of the development ofindustrial relations during the year and would draw attention to any problems that the Commission regarded as being of special importance./iVe
iVe: The Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers1 Associations39, Under existing law the rules and conduct of trade unions and employers associations are, in some limited respects, subject to independent scrutiny and supervision by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.   But the Government considers the existing provisions inadequate.   They do not ensure that the membership canexercise reasonable democratic control of the union, or give the individual member(or applicant for membership) sufficient safeguards against unjust treatment by theunion-40.  It therefore proposes to create a new office of Registrar of Trade unions and Employers&apos; Associations,.   The Registrar would take over the present responsi-bilities of the Registrar of Friendly Societies in relation to trade unions and employers&apos; associations and would have the additional functions outlined in Part VT.41.  The Registrar&apos;s main responsibilities would be to ensure that trade unionsobserved their rules and were properly administered, in order to safeguard thepublic interest and to protect the rights of union members and applicants for membership.   In order to carry these out effectively, he would have authority to conduct preliminary enquiries and to call for documents.   He would be able to initiate enquiries, either at the request of individual members or applicants for membership, or on the basis of any information he received from elsewhere.   If he felt, following enquiries, that an allegation of malpractice was justified, hewould have discretion to resolve the matter himself by conciliation and by advice to the parties.   In the last resort, however the member (or the Registrar after an investigation which he had initiated himself) would be able to take a case to theNIRC for adjudication.   (See also Part VId).11
IVf; Arbitration Board.   Courts of Inquiry42.   To avoid confusion, the existing Industrial Court would be renamed the arbitration Board,   Its present functions would remain substantially unchanged,but Section 8 of the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1 959 would be amended so that only registered trade unions could initiate a referenceunder that section.   The Board would in addition be responsible for arbitration in cases referred to it by ?. registered union authorised to doso by the NIRC under Part VII d and e of these proposals.45.   It is proposed that the Secretary of State should retain his existing powers in industrial disputes, including in particular his powersto arrange for conciliation under the Conciliation Act 1896 and to refermatters to arbitration and to commission inquiries under the industrial courts Act 1919.1112
V,    WORKERS * RIGHTSVa:   In relation to trade union membership, non-membership or activity44.   In the Government&apos;s view each worker should have an unqualified right to choose whether or not to join a trade union.45.  The Government therefore proposes to make provision in the industrial relations Bill to secure the right of an individual to belong to an independentregistered trade union of his choice and to take part in that trade union&apos;activities.   Equally the Bill would secure the right of an individual to choosenot to belong to a trade union.46,   Under these provisions an individual would be able to seek redress for any action of his employer which is designed to deter him from joining a registeredtrade union,   continuing in membership of such a union, or taking part in thatunion&apos;s lawful activities, or which penalises or discriminates against him forthese reasons.   This protection would similarly apply where an individual waspenalised or discriminated against for refusing to join   or continue membership of a trade union.   Compensation could be awarded, if appropriate, against anyone who had put pressure on the employer, as well as the employer himself.47-   It is also proposed to make it an unfair industrial action to organise, orthreaten to organise, a strike to put pressure on an employer to discriminate against an individual because of his membership or non-membership of a registeredtrade union.48.   There would be corresponding provisions to protect people seeking employment.49&apos;   Claims about the infringement of the right to belong or not to belong to a registered trade union would be dealt with by the Industrial Tribunals.Vb:   In relation to unfair dismissal50.   At present an employee may seek damages if he is dismissed in breach of contract and the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 provides protection for the employeedismissed on account of redundancy.   However an employee has no redress against his employer for unfair dismissal./51.   Britain
51.   Britain is one&apos; of the few countries where dismissals are a frequent causeof strike action.    It seems reasonable to link this with the fact that in thiscountry, unlike most others, the law provides no redress for the employee whosuffers unfair or arbitrary dismissal if the employer has met the terms of the contract, eg with regard to giving notice.   Thus an employee can be dismissedwithout reasonable cause and though this may severely prejudice his futurelivelihood the lav/ gives him no right of appeal against his dismissal.     TheGovernment considers that this situation is unsatisfactory and, both on grounds of principle and as a means of removing a significant cause of industrial disputes, it proposes to include provisions in the Industrial Relations Billto give statutory protection against unfair dismissal.52.   It is proposed that employees should have a right to appeal to an industrial   Tribunal if they consider that they have been unfairly dismissed.Initially, because of limitations on the rate at which the Tribunals can be expanded for their additional functions, this right would have to be limitedto employees with two or more years&apos;  service in their employment;   but theintention would be to extend the right to other employees later.   Remedieswould be available in respect of dismissals for reasons of membership or non- -membership of a registered trade union or for participation in trade unionactivities without the need for any such two year qualifying period.53.   A dismissal would be fair if the employer had acted reasonably and haddismissed the employee because, for example, of redundancy or the employee&apos;conduct or capability.   Where a Tribunal found a dismissal unfair it would beable to recommend reinstatement or, alternatively, to award compensation.Neither the employer nor the employee could be compelled to accept a Tribunal&apos;recommendation of reinstatement, but any unreasonable refusal could be reflected in the award of compensation.   Compensation would be awarded on the basis of assessment of past and probable future loss, broadly as at common law (taking account of the ordinary duty of a claimant to mitigate his loss so far as/possible
possible).        Any award would:,   however,   be   subject   to   a limit (as suggested by the Donovan   Commission) of two years&apos; wages or salary,disregarding any wages or salary in excess of  40 per week.54.   It would be an unfair industrial action to induce, or threaten to induce,a strike to secure the unfair dismissal of an employee.   The Tribunal would,where it considers it appropriate, be able to award compensation for unfairdismissal against any others who had put pressure on the employer to dismiss,as well as against the employer himself.55.   Some employees already have the benefit of voluntary procedures which provide them with safeguards against unfair dismissal.   The Government is anxious toencourage such responsible self-government within industry and therefore proposesto provide for the exemption from the statutory machinery of voluntary procedures which provide adequate protection against unfair dismissal for the employeescovered by them.Vc:   Under the Contracts of Employment Act 1963560   The Contracts of Employment Act prescribes minimum periods of notice of termination for employers and emploj^ees.   In the case of the employee theseperiods of notice vary from one to four weeks depending on his length of service.57.   The Government considers that the periods of notice provided by the Act should now be increased for the long service employees, by. providing for :\ minimum of 6weeks&apos; notice after 10 years&apos; service and 8 weeks&apos; notice after 15 years&apos; service.The period of service qualifying both employer and employee to an entitlement ofa minimum of one week&apos;s notice would be reduced from 26 to 13 weeks.58.   The provisions of the   Act under which employers are required to give their employees a written statement of their main terms of employment would be amended to ensure that employees are given adequate information about any terms andconditions affecting their proposed basic right to choose whether or not to belong to a trade union, and about the steps which they should take to bringany grievance to the notice of the employer.15 /Vd:   Conciliation
Vd:   Cone iliation59.   Wherever possible it is intended to promote the voluntary settlement of complaints about unfair dismissal or other infringements of individual rights,by conciliation.   The   Secretary of   State would be responsible for providing a concilation service in relation to such complaints.   The Bill would provide forthis service to be informed when a complaint was lodged with the Tribunals andfor conciliation officers to seek to obtain a voluntary settlement between theparties before the matter came for hearing before the   Tribunal.   It is hopedthat this would encourage the early settlement of such disputes, without theneed for a case to be heard before a Tribunal.Ve:   Alleged breaches of contracts of employment60.   The Government considers that employees might often find the IndustrialTribunals, with their practical, and comparatively informal, approach to questionsof employment and industrial relations, a more convenient and accessible forum for cases about alleged breach of a contract of employment than the Courts.It therefore proposes to carry out the recommendation of the   Donovan   commission that provision should be made for the Industrial Tribunals to hear such cases.. &apos; &apos;:f$ -51.   This could not be introduced straight away, however, since the capacity ofthe Tribunals would first have to be expanded sufficiently to deal with the-additional cases (and with the other new functions which it is proposed to give1 ito them).   The Government therefore proposes that power should be takento-extend the Tribunals1  jurisdiction in this way by statutory: instrument.62,   This power would not, however, extend to cases in which damages are claimedfor personal injuries or death;   nor would it permit any remedy other thancompensation;   nor would it give the Industrial   Tribunals an exclusivejurisdiction in this field./Vf:   Overlap with   Race Relations Act 1968
Vf;   Overlap with Race Relations Act 196863, Some of . the proposals in this document overlap with the Race Relations Act1968 and are&apos;more generous to the aggrieved individual than that Act eg inrelation to claims that dismissal, by an employer, or discriminatory actli&amp;fby a trade union (whether registered or not), was due to colour, race, or ethnic or national origins.   Where this is so, it is intended that the Government&apos;sproposals should take the place of the Act.    It is proposed, however, that insuch cases the Race Relations Act machinery should still be available for-securing an assurance of no further acts of discrimination and for dealingwith.breaches of such assurances.Vg:   Rights in relation to the present law64.   The legislation would make it clear that no court will have power to compelan individual worker to remain at work against his will, or to compel him,whether directly or indirectly, to refrain from working in accordance with hiscontract of service.   Thus a worker who was on strike could not be compelled bythe courts to return to work;   nor could they compel a worker to take strike action.65.   It is proposed to keep in force the existing provisions protectingindividuals who join together in an industrial dispute from actions for criminalor civil conspiracy (section 3 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act1875 and section 1 of the Trade   Disputes Act 1906).   It is also proposed to implement the recommendation of the Donovan   Commission that, since it is nota tort for individual employees to go on strike in breach of their contracts ofemployment, any danger that an agreement between them to do so might beactionable as a tort should be removed.66.   In the present courts, those involved in industrial disputes would retainall their existing immunities from legal action, by giving the NIRC and ITs,generally speaking, an exclusive jurisdiction in civil cases arising from industrial disputes (paragraph 20).    ^Registered trade       v/unions17
unions and other industrial relations organisations (see Part VI.) would howeverlose their present immunity in the ordinary courts (under section 1+ of theTrade Disputes Act 1 906) from actions in tort not connected with an industrial dispute.67.     In addition, it is proposed to have a provision in relation to the NIRCand ITs, comparable to the second part of section 3 of the Trade Disputes Act 1906,that an act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute is not actionable on the ground only that it is an interference withthe trade, business or employment of some other person, or with some otherperson1s right to dispose of his capital or his labour.68.     Registered trade unions, and their officials and members acting with their authority, would enjoy in the NIRC and the ITs a protection comparable to thatwhich they have at present (under sections 3 and 4- of the Trade Disputes Act1906) from actions in tort connected with an industrial dispute - although theywould not enjoy any immunity in relation to unfair industrial actions and inthe other ways proposed in this document (paragraph 83 and Part VI d).It is further intended to provide that a threat of industrial action would beregarded as unfair only if the proposed industrial action was itself unfair.There would also be an upper limit on awards of compensation against them(paragraph 85).69.     Other industrial relations organisations and individuals, however, wouldnot enjoy any special immunity in the NIRC and ITs from actions in tort connectedwith industrial disputes.   In particular they could be sued for inducing workers to go on strike in breach of their individual contracts of employment, orthreatening to do so (paragraph 110) - thus removing (in the NIRC and ITs) theprotection which they at present enjoy under the first part of section 3 of theTrade Disputes Act 1 906, and under the Trades Disputes Act 1 965 (which would be repealed).   There would also be no upper limit on awards of compensation againstunregistered associations./70.   Certain kinds18
70.     Certain kinds of &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;sympathetic&quot; industrial action would becategorised as unfair industrial actions.    Thus it would be an unfair industrial action to procure or attempt to procure the breach of any commercial contractby inducing or threatening industrial action that was in breach of individualcontracts of employment.    It would similarly be unfair to interfere in such away with the performance of any commercial contract.71 .    The G-overnment has reviewed the role of the criminal law in industrial disputes.   It considers that it has no place except in relation to situationsinvolving violence or threats of it, or risk of serious injury.72.     It therefore proposes to repeal section 1+ of the Conspiracy and ProtectionAct 1875, as amended, which makes it a criminal offence for any person employedby a gas, electricity or water undertaking maliciously and wilfully to breakhis contract of service, if he knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, thatthe probable consequence of his doing so will be to deprive inhabitants in thearea concerned of supplies.   The necessary safeguard against such action leading to serious harm is provided by section 5 of the same Act, which makes it a criminal offence for any person wilfully and maliciously to break a contract of -service or of hiring, if he knows or has reasonable cause to believe that theconsequences of his doing so will be to endanger human life or to cause seriousbodily injury or to expose valuable property to destruction or serious injury.It is proposed to retain this section.73.     The Government proposes that the protection which the law gives to peacefulpicketing (section 2 of the Trade Disputes Act 1906) should not apply to thepicketing of a person1s home.74.     The Bill would protect people who wished to exercise their rights under it from any attempt to put pressure on them not to do so.    It would therefore makeit an unfair industrial action to take, induce or threaten any action to prevent or hinder any person from exercising or asserting any right or performing any duty under it.   It would also make void any agreement not authorised under it,which excluded or limited the operation of any right under it.Al.   TRADE UNIONS19
VI,   TRADE UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS&apos; ASSOCIATIONSVia:   Registration and status75.    At present the additional rights which trade unions and employers associations gain by registration, and the additional duties which they accept,are relatively limited.   Legal status as a trade union, and many associatedadvantages, are available equally to registered and unregistered bodies.   In theGovernment1 s view, the substantial new rights ?;hich it proposes for trade unionsshould only apply to those which, by registering, accept statutory minimum standards in relation to their rules and the rights of their members.76.    It therefore proposes to introduce a new system of registration vrtiich willlimit legal status as a trade union or employers&apos; association to registeredorganisations.   The rights and privileges accorded to trade unions and employers&apos;associations in the Bill ?fOuld accordingly only be granted to those which areregistered.   Registration would also enable the organisation to hold property inits own name.77.    Registration as a trade union would be available only to workers&apos;organisations, and registration as an employers&apos; association only to employers&apos;organisations;   the test would be whether the membership was composed wholly or mainly of workers, or of employers, in each case.78,    Federations or other joint organisations of trade unions, or of employers&apos;association, would be eligible for registration in a separate section of theregister and would be granted legal status as a trade union or employers&apos;association, as the case may be.   Such federations would have to be composedwholly of registered organisations.79.    Further conditions of eligibility would be:(i)   that one of the principal objects of the organisation is the regulationof relations between employers and workers.(Organisations with other objectsbesides the regulation of relations, for example some professionalassociations, would therefore be eligible to register providing theysatisfy the other conditions).20
(ii)   that the constitution of the organisation gives it adequate controlover the determination of its objects and procedures and over the purposes for which funds may be used to be able to meet the requirements of registration.   (Branches of registered trade unions or employers&apos;Iassociations would therefore not be eligible for separate registration;unions consisting of several autonomous parts would be eligible only for registration as federations).(iii)   if the organisation is a trade union or federation of unions, thatit is not under the domination or control of an employer or employers.80.    It is proposed that it should be an unfair industrial action for an employeror a number of employers or an employers&apos; association to dominate or seek to dominate a registered trade union, or to take any action to interfere withthe formation or administration of a registered trade union which is calculatedor intended to bring it under the domination or control of an employer or anumber of employers or an employers&apos; association.81.    Trade unions, employers&apos; associations and federations which are registered as trade unions under the Trade Union Act 1 871 would, if they satisfy the new conditions of eligibility, be transferred to the appropriate section of the newregister.   Other organisations seeking registration would have to make anapplication, supported by a copy of their constitution and rules and other necessary information.82.    Registered organisations would be required to make an annual report tol their members.83.    Registered trade unions and employers&apos; associations, and their officials,would continue to enjoy immunity from actions in tort in respect of acts done in contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute.   But, as the DonovanCommission proposed, they would no longer have their present immunity in respectof other, &quot;non-industrial&quot; tortious acts;   nor would they have any immunity ,;,before the NIRC and ITs in relation to unfair industrial actions and in the other ways proposed in this document(eg Part VI d).21 ,      /84. -,.    *-(/.

In addition there would be upper limits on the compensation that couldbe awarded against a registered trade union in any proceedings before theNLRC or the ITs.   Subject to this, all the funds of a union that were availableto finance industrial action would be treated as available for the payment ofcompensation awards.VIb:   Rules86.    It is proposed that registered organisations should be required to haverules which do not conflict with basic principles affecting members&apos; rights,and which deal adequately with subjects specified in the Bill.   The Registrarwould have discretion to allow a reasonable period for each organisation to meet these requirements]   he would also have power to waive a specific requirement in a particular case.87.    Failure to meet the requirements in the time allowed would lead tocancellation of registration.   Provision would also be made for cancellation of registration if, in the Registrar&apos;s opinion, the organisation ceased to be eligible for registration under the criteria set out in paragraphs 77-79*88.    All decisions of the Registrar concerning registration, cancellation of registration, or rules requirements would be subject to appeal to the national industrial Relations Court.89.    It is proposed that the Bill should set out the following basic principles to ensure that members of a registered trade union (and of any other organisation with similar purposes) enjoy equal rights to participate in the affairs of theorganisation and to receive fair treatment in their relations with it (even ifits rules provide to the contrary):22/(i)   the organisation
CONFIDENTIAL(i)   the organisation must not arbitrarily or unreasonably exclude from membership anyone who is reasonably qualified to undertake a kind of workordinarily done by members of the union.(ii)   if a member has met his obligations (eg as to subscriptions), theorganisation must not restrict his right to resign;(iii)   every member must have an equal right to hold office, to nominatecandidates, to vote in elections or ballots, to attend meetings and toparticipate in the business of meetings - subject to reasonable rulesdetermined by the organisation;(iv)   subject to reasonable rules, all members must have an equal right to vote in any situation where a vote is taken;   they must also have a fair and reasonable opportunity to vote without interference or constraint;and where the voting is by ballot, its secrecy must be properly secured;(v)   no member of an organisation may be disciplined, suspended, expelledor have his membership terminated (other than for non-payment ofsubscription) unless he has been given written notice of the charge brought against him, a reasonable time to prepare his defence, a full and fairhearing and a written statement of the findings;(vi)   no organisation may limit the right of any member to institute,proceedings in any court or tribunal&apos;or his&apos;right to appear as-a witnessin any proceedings;(vii)   no member who refuses to participate in any industrial action whichis deemed unfair by the Bill may be expelled, disciplined or discriminatedagainst bjr the organisation, notwithstanding anything in its rules./90.     Registered23
90.    Registered, organisations would be required to have rules which dealadequately -with specified matters, although the organisation would remain free to draw up its own rules on these matters.   Different requirements would belaid on trade unions and employers&apos; associations on the one hand, andfederations on the other.91.    The rules of registered trade unions and employers&apos; associations wouldbe required to make adequate provision for a more comprehensive list of subjectsthan is contained in the Trade Union Act 1871 .   This would be based on therecommendations of the Donovan Commission that rules should deal adequatelywith admission, discipline, disputes bet?;een unions and their members and theprocedure for elections as well as the determination of objects, method ofgovernment and the conduct of business.92. The rules of federations would be required to deal with broadly similarmatters, but excluding those relating to the interests of individual members,notably those relating to admission and discipline.93. Further details of the proposed provisions mentioned in paragraphs 91 a.nd 92are given in Appendix I./Vic;   Audit of accounts24
/aboutVic:   Audit of accounts and investigation of superannuation schemes94,   Registered trade unions are at present required by the Trade Union Act 1871to have their accounts audited and to submit an annual statement of accounts tothe Registrar of Friendly Societies,   The Donovan Commission agreed with the registrar&apos;s recommendation that all butthe smallest trade unions should berequired to appoint professional auditors and to have members1 superannuationschemes periodically investigated by an actuary.95.   The Government therefore proposes that registered trade unions and employers&apos; associations should be required to maintain proper accounting records,appoint professionally qualified auditors to audit the accounts, and submitthese accounts in an annual return to the Registrar of Trade Unions andSHployers&apos; Associations together with a copy of the auditor&apos;s report.   Smallerunions would be exempted from the requirement to employ auditors who areprofessionally qualified but they would still be required to have their accountsaudited and submit them to the Registrar.96.   Registered trade unions and employers&apos; associations possessingsuperannuation schemes for their members would have to have them examined by a qualified actuary at stated intervals to ensure that the schemes are viable.They would be required to set up separate superannuation funds if they do nothave them at present.   Copies of the actuary&apos;s report would have to be sentto the Registrar and supplied to members of the union on request.VId:   Complaints97.   In the Government&apos;s view, individuals who consider that they have grounds for complaint against a trade union about certain matters (particularly those that may affect their employment, or that concern the democratic - running of theunion) should in the last resort have a right to have their complaint heard by anindependent body not connected with the union,98,   it therefore proposes that members of registered trade unions and employers&apos;associations should be given access to the Registrar, and to the IndustrialTribunals and in some cases the National Industrial Relations Court, to complain
about such matters.   Access would also he available for former members and personsseeking membership.   Members of other organisations with purposes akin to thoseof a trade union would have similar rights.99,  Complaint could be made in this way about any acts which are in breach ofthe basic principles set out in the Bill, or which are in breach of the rales ofthe organisation.100. Tribunsd-s (and the National Industrial Relations Court) would have power torefer a complaint from a member of a registered organisation to the Registrar ofTrade Unions and employers Associations for investigation and conciliation.   the registrar would have power to take similar action on such complaints made direct to him by the member.   He would also have power to investigate alleged breaches of the basic principles or of the rules at his own initiative if he had reasontn believe that there had been serious or persistent breach of the basic principalsor of its own rules by a registered organisation.101, If the Registrar were unable to settle the matter the Tribunal (or theNational Industrial Relations Court) would hear the oo.hplp.irf .&apos; , The case   wouldbe brought by the member or, if the Registrar had initiated the investigation,by the Registrar himself.   If the Tribunal or Court found the complaint jur.tifit would have power to ordor a remedy, including the award of compensation where appropriate..   Compensation for loss of employment result:ng from wrongful terai-nation of, or exclusd.cn from, membership would be calculated on the same basis as for unfair dismissal.   In the last resort, if there were serious and persistentbreaches of these requirements, the union could be deregistered.102. The Tribunals end the National Industrial Relations Court would be able torefuse to consider a complaint which is not made within a reasonable time, and to defer the hearing of a complaint until the complaint had made use of his organisa-tions&apos;s internal appeals procedure.il 4-ljtaployers8 associations103. It is proposed that the Bill should provide for employers1 associations to beSeated as a separate category, instead of continuing to be covered by the defini&quot;--&apos;Qf &quot;trade union&quot; as under the present law.   This was one of the recommendations of% Donovan Commission, /104,   The
104, The requirements of the Bill about registered employers&apos; associations wouldcorrespond generally to those about registered trade unions, except where thiswas clearly inappropriate.105. The requirements about an annual report to members, an annual return to the registrar, the submission of information to the Registrar, and audit andsuperannuation would apply to employers&apos; associations as to trade unions.106. Registered employers&apos; associations, like registered trade unions, would berequired to have rules on specified subjects and to cover particular natters onthese subjects.   The Registrar would have power to waive requirements about rulesin a particular case if they were clearly inappropriate.Vlf:   Other combinations of workers107a As explained above, it is proposed to confine the title and status ol&quot;trade union&quot; to those organisations that register as such.   However, as was recognised by the Donovan Commission (and by the House of Lords in the HarrisTweed case, 1942) there are likely to be occasions when a group of workerscombine together to advance or defend their own lawful interests, in a way which,in essence, involves the regulation of relations between themselves and their employers.   This might happen, for example, in the course of organising a newtrade unions   As explained in paragraph 65 above, the Government proposes thatthe members of such a combination should continue to enjoy th^-ir. presentprotection.108, There is, however, no reason why such a combination, which has not yetaccepted the responsibilities implied in registration, should enjoy the other benefits or privileges proposed in this document for registered trade unions,in organisation of this kind would, therefore, have to register as a trade unionbefore it acquired the right to commence proceedings or make any claim before any of the new agencies proposed in this document.   Only after registration,for example, could such an organisation put a claim for recognition to theNUtC (part VII d) or operate an agency shop (part VII f).   And only then wouldits members have the protection proposed for the right to join or take part inthe activities of a trade union, y109^   ^ ^27
109.     For the same reasons it would not be right for such a combinationto be any less accountable than a registered trade union.   It is proposedto provide, therefore, that such an organisation should be subject to thesame liabilities as a registered trade union (for example in respect ofany unfair industrial action).   It is proposed to enable propeedings tobe commenced and enforced against the funds of such an organisation with-out the necessity for bringing a representative action against some of its members.   And if, before registration, the organisation operated a polit-ical fund, it would (like registered trade unions) be subject to theappropriate provisions of the Trade Union Act 1913*110.     It is proposed to provide that organisations and individuals, otherthan registered trade unions and employers&apos; associations (and theirofficials and authorised agents) should be liable to proceedings beforethe NIRC or the ITs if, in the course of an industrial dispute, they in-due 0 (or threaten to induce) workers to break their contracts of employ-ment.   This change is necessary because the existing immunity in thesecircumstances has increasingly been abused in sudden unofficial strikes,and because a clear distinction must be drawn between the privileges ofa registered organisation, which would, under these proposals, have accepted certain basic obligations, and the joeition of any comparableorganisation that had not yet accepted such obligations.111.     Once such an organisation had registered it would, of course,secure the limitation of liability and the other advantages proposed for registered trade unions in paragraphs 83 - 85 above.
29VII.   COLLECTIVE BARGAININGVila:   Legal status of collective agreements112.   At the present time collective agreements between employers and unions have a doubtful status in lav;.    In principle there is no reason whya collective agreement, like any other valid contract, cannot be made legally binding;   but in practice the attitude of the parties to collective agreements,the lack of any clear indication that they are to be legally bound, and theform and language of agreements have encouraged the viex; (which has beenaccepted by the courts in some cases) that most collective agreements are not intended to have the force of legally binding contracts.113.   In the Government&apos;s view this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.First, it is essential that the legal status of collective agreements shouldbe clear and unambiguous.   Secondly, it is highly desirable that agreements should be expressed in language which makes quite clear what it is the parties have agreed to.    Thirdly, the parties should regard - or come to regard -the signing of agreements as a responsible act which binds them in law to honour their commitments.114.   The Government therefore proposes that the Bill should create apresumption that any written collective agreement entered into after a givendate should be a legally binding and enforceable contract unless there is anexpress written provision to the contrary in the agreement itself.   In thisway, the presumption would be rebutted, as with a commercial agreement only byclear evidence that the parties did not intend to enter into legal relations.The provision in section 4(4) of the Trade Union Act 1871 which prevents thecourts from enforcing directly an agreement between a trade union and anemployers&apos; association would bo repealed.115.   There would be an obligation on the parties to a legally bindingcollective agreement to use their best endeavours to avoid or end anyindustrial action which was in breach of the agreement or, which, if undertaken by a party to it, would have been a breach of it.
116.    Any action about the alleged breach of a legally binding collective agreement would be heard by the NIRC or the ITs.117.     It would be an unfair industrial action to induce a party to alegally enforceable collective agreement to break it.Vllb:   Selective introduction of enforceable agreements        I118.    Despite these provisions, there uiay still be no legally enforceableprocedure agreements or indeed no satisfactory procedure agreements at all,in some nectors of industry for some time to come.   In some cases this maybe an important contributory factor to poor industrial relations.   this possibility has led the Government to examine other proposals for securingthe introduction of clear and legally enforceable procedural provisions.119.     The Government therefore proposes that an employer or a recognisedregistered trade union (or the Secretary of State) should be able to applyto the NIRC for a reference to the CIR to review existing procedures, orthe absence of procedures, with a view to producing new or improved procedure-ural provisions which could, if necessary be made legally binding.   If theCourt were satisfied, on the evidence brought before it and in accordancewith specified criteria, that the development or maintenance of orderlyindustrial relations in the undertaking concerned had been seriously im-peded by recourse to industrial action in breach of the procedure agree-ment, or in the absence of any effective agreement, it would refer thematter for investigation by the CIR120.     The CIR would then have the task of examining any existing pro-cedural provisions and:a. indicating which (if any) of these provisions could form partof a clear, effective and suitable procedure agreement;b. insofar as it considered any existing procedure agreement wasdeficient, or found that there was no procedure agreement,promoting discussion between the parties with a view to theiragreeing to suitable provisions to make good the deficiency;30
o.     if suitable provisions could not be agreed by the parties,recommending provisions which should be incorporated in the agreement.121.        The CIR would report to the Court, indicating what it considered tobe suitable and effective procedure provisions - and whether or not these were incorporated in an existing agreement or had been agreed in discussions between the parties.122.        Any of the parties concerned would have the right to apply to havethe CIR&apos;s recommendations   made legally binding by order-.of theNIRC.   When such an application was made, the NIRC would have to notify allthe other parties ( and the Secretary of State) and would conduct a hearingif any of the parties so requested.123.        At such a hearing, any party could ask for the application to be turned down on the ground that it was not necessary, in order to establishorderly industrial relations and secure the observance of procedure agreements,to make the provisions legally enforceable.124.        Any party could also argue that the provisions were insufficientlyclear to be made legally enforceable.   If the NIRC agreed, it could seek theagreement of the parties to clearer provisions and, if they did not agree,could refer the matter back to the CIR for further consideration.125.       Unless the NIRC rejected the application or referred it back to theCIR, it would make an order declaring the provisions legally enforceableagainst the specified parties.126.        There would be appropriate provisions for the modification of provisions made legally enforceable by such an order, and for applicationto have the order revoked when no longer needed.Tile:   Notification of procedure agreements and arrangements127.        The Government proposes to continue the existing scheme for the voluntary notification of procedure agreements and arrangements to the DEP.The intention is to use the information obtained by notification to identify/areas where
areas where procedures can he improved.   It is proposed to take reserve powersto make this notification a statutory obligation.   It is hoped that, as inthe past, the vast majority of employers will continue to co-operate on a voluntary basis without any use of these powers.128.       The proposed reserve powers would enable the Secretary of State,after consulting the CBI and TUC, to make regulations requiring employers to notify the DEP of procedure agreements and arrangements at plant and  &apos;company level and to inform the DEP of any national or industry-wideprocedure agreements or arrangements which they observe.   The regulations would have to allow at least six months for this information to be suppliedcEmployers who had already supplied the information on a voluntary basiscould be exempted.VIId;   Recognition and bargaining rights129.       It is of first importance to satisfactory collective bargainingand healthy industrial relations to establish a stable and effectivebargaining structure.   This implies, on the one hand, a readiness on thepart of employers to negotiate seriously and responsibly with unions whichrepresent and enjoy the support of a substantial body of employees;   and,on the other hand, workable and dependable arrangements and machinery through which employers and employee representatives can communicate, negotiate andresolve their disputes.130.       In the Government&apos;s view disputes about bargaining rights andbargaining structure can be most satisfactorily resolved by the partiesthemselves (where necessary with help of conciliation) who will generallyrecognise their joint interest in achieving a good working relationship with one another.   There are, however, situations where - because of the unwillingness of the employer to concede recognition to one/or more unions,or because of disputes between unions over the right to represent particular groups of employees or because of the fragmentation of bargaining - the strain32 /on industrial
on industrial relations becomes excessive and the parties are entirely unableto compose their differences or to contemplate a fundamental change in the bargaining structure;   It is in these situations that the Government believes that the possibility of recourse to independent investigation may preventdestructive conflict  and a breakdown in industrial relations..i   It is toprevent such an outcome that the proposals in this section are directed.131.   The Government proposed to provide that any registered trade union,any employer or registered employers&apos; association, a substantial proportionof the employees concerned, or the Secretary of State, could make a claimto the NIRC to have any dispute over a trade union&apos;s claim for recognition,or over bargaining structure, examined by the CIR.   It y/ould be an unfairindustrial action to call a strike (or lock-out) over any question of recognition or bargaining rights while it was before the NIRC or the CIRand for a period after the CIR reported.   The NIRC would refer the matter to the CIR if it were satisfied that no further progress could be madeby discussions between the parties and/or conciliation, and that such a reference would help the development or maintenance of stable and effectivebargaining arrangements.132.   The CIR would then investigate the problem and recommendi.   an appropriate bargaining unit or units 1ii.   a bargaining agent for each unit;iii.   any conditions which should be satisfied before recognitionwas granted to the bargaining agent.133.   The &quot;bargaining unit&quot; would mean the employees, or a group of the employees, of&apos; a single employer 01- group of associated employers, -whoseterms and conditions of employment should, in the view of the CIR, bedetermined in the same negotiations.134.   The &quot;bargaining agent&quot; would be the registered union or the joint negotiating panel which should have sole negotiating rights for all employeeswithin a bargaining unit.   The CIR would not be able to recommend more thanone bargaining agent for a bargaining unit.33eONF8DEOT8AlL_^_-
135,     The terms &quot;bargaining unit&quot; and &quot;bargaining agent&quot; have, for convenience, been borrowed from United States law and practice.   TheGovernment proposes that these concepts should be applied only in the specific sibuations described in this document, where this is necessary,to promote the development of stable and effective collective bargaining,and does not envisage that they should be generally applied as in theUnited States.136.    A joint negotiating panel would be a body in which a number ofregistered unions had vested appropriate authority to enter into collective agreements on their behalf and whose entry into such an agreement would commit each of the constituent unions as if it were a direct party to theagreement.    The CIR would be able to recommend, and to assist with, thecreation of a joint negotiating panel. It would specify, in its recommenda-tions, which unions should belong to the panel - though obviously, in doing so, it would take account of any successful existing arrangements, and the readiness of unions to work together.137.     In considering whether a union or joint negotiating panel should bea bargaining agent, the CIR would take account of the ^extent to which theunion or joint panel:i.     has the support (not necessarily membership) of a substantial proportion of employees affected;    and ii.     has the resources and organisation that would enable iteffectively to represent the employees.133.     The CIR would be able to recommend that no bargaining agent shouldbe recognised if the union or unions concerned, or any feasible joint negotiating panel, did not (or would not) have substantial support fromemployees or had not (or would not have) the resources and organisation to enable it to represent employees effectively.139.     The CIR could, where appropriate, specify conditions which must be fulfilled by the union or joint panel before statutory bargaining rightscould be granted.    Such conditions might, for example, relate to makingsufficient trained officials and shop stewards available to participate in negotiations;    or to an agreement not to pursue a claim for negotiatingeights elsewhere in the undertaking.34 11
140.   The purpose of the CIR&apos;s examination would he to try to produce adurable solution to the dispute which gave rise to the reference.   In general,if the CIR found that settled recognition arrangements were working well,it would be unlikely to disturb them.141.        The CIR would prepare a document embodying its recommendations andwould send it to the NIRC, with copies to the Secretary of State, the employer,and the unions concerned in the reference.142.        The employer or the recommended bargaining agent could then applyto have the CIR&apos;s recommendations made enforceable;    and the NIRC wouldenforce the recommendations if a majority of the employees concerned, voting in a secret ballot, endorsed the CTR&quot;s recommendations.143.        After the NIRC had made an order making the CIR&apos;s recommendationsenforceable, the employer would be obliged to negotiate seriously with the bargaining agent.   It would be an unfair industrial action for him to fail to do so, or to negotiate with anyone else in respect of the bargaining unitor any part of it;   and for anyone else to threaten industrial action, orto induce the employees to take industrial action, to disrupt in any way thestatutory bargaining structure.    If the NIRC found that an employer had failedto negotiate seriously, it could give the union a right unilaterally to refera claim for improved terms and conditions of employment for the employees concerned to the Arbitration Board, whose award would be binding.144.        There would be appropriate provisions for recognition orders to be modified or revoked when necessary.   In particular, if, after a suitableminimum period, a large proportion of the employees were dissatisfied withthe bargaining agent, they would be able to reopen the matter and secure afurther ballot on whether its position as bargaining agent should be endedor transferred to another union.11/vTIe:    Disclosure
Vile:   Disclosure of information by employers145- The Government considers that it is an essential part of the successfulconduct of collective bargaining that the employer should not unnecessarilywithhold information about his undertaking that the trade union1 representativesneed in the course of negotiations.146.       It therefore proposes that the Code of Industrial Relations Practice(which the Secretary of State would have to prepare, as explained in Part III)should contain a statement of the principles and practice to be applied by employers in relation to the disclosure of information about their undertaking,0to trade union representatives with whom they negotiate.   This part of the code would provide guidance about the disclosure of information without whichtrade union representatives would be impeded in their conduct of negotiation,?147.       If an employer failed in the course of negotiations to discloseinformation in accordance with the code to representatives of a registeredtrade union that he recognised, the union could complain to the national industrial Relations Court,   If its complaint were upheld, the Court couldgrant the union the right unilaterally to refer a claim for improved terms and conditions of employment for the employees concerned for arbitration by the Arbitration Board, whose award would be binding.148.       In the Government&apos;s view, the employees of the larger employers should be entitled to some basic information about the undertaking, just asshareholders are in the case of public companies.   The provision of this information to employees would recognise the interest which they have inthe progress of the undertaking for which they work, and would acknowledgeits obligations towards them./149,   It is therefore
-149.        It is therefore proposed that the Secretary of State should havepower to require employers of a certain size or type, by regulations whichwould be subject to the approval of Parliament, to disclose specifiedinformation to their employees at stated intervals.15O.        Appropriate provisions would be made for the protection of confidential personal information and information the disclosure of which&quot;uld be seriously prejudicial to the interests of the employer&apos;s undertaking.Vllf:   The &quot;closejl sjiop&quot; and the &quot;agency shop&quot;151.        The Government is opposed to the &quot;pre-entry closed shop&quot; which canexclude an individual from entering certain employments if he is not a memberof any or of a particular trade union.   It considers that an employer shouldbe free to employ anyone who has the necessary skills.   It proposes that theIndustrial Relations Bill should contain provisions making any &quot;pre-entryclosed shop&quot; agreement or arrangement void, and that any strike action(or threat of strike action) to enforce the continuation of, or to inducean employer to enter into, such an agreement should be an unfair industrial action.152.        On the other hand the Government believes there is much to commend&quot;agency shop&quot; agreements, whereby a registered trade union represents all the employees in a particular undertaking or establishment or in part of it,and is supported financially by all of them.   It considers, however, thatemployees should have a right to choose whether or not such an arrangement should govern their own place of employment or continue to do so, and thatthe individual should have a right, while paying for the services the unionprovides, to choose not to be a member of the union,/153 -   It is proposed37
15% It is proposed to provide that the introduction or continued operation of an&quot;agency shop&quot; should be subject to the right of the employer or a registered tradeunion or 20% of the employees covered by the arrangement to request a secret ballotwhether the employees are in favour of such an arrangement.   It would not be permissible to introduce or continue an &quot;agency shop&quot; arrangement unless the ballot showed that a majority of the employees eligible to vote were in favourof the arrangement.    If the ballot showed that a majority of those eligible to vote were in favour of the introduction of an &quot;agency shop&quot; the employer wouldbe obliged to enter into an agreement with the appropriate registered tradeunion to introduce the &quot;agency shop&quot; and if he failed to do so the trade unionconcerned would be able to seek an order from the National Industrial Relation&apos;sCourt requiring him to do so.   Only a registered trade union would be entitled tosecure an agency shop agreement.154. Applications for agency shop ballots would be dealt with by the national industrial Relations Court and, where an application is approved by the Court,the Commission on Industrial Relations would be responsible for supervising orarranging the ballot.155. where an employer entered into an agency shop agreement with a registeredtrade union he could require the employees concerned, after an interval of tine,to join that trade union or to pay a regular contribution in lieu of the union&apos;s membership subscription.   Anyone who did not follow either course would be liableto dismissal.   The appropriate contribution would be in respect of the services provided by the trade union, and would be comparable to the subscription whichthe ordinary member of the union would&apos;be required to pay, less any optionalelements.   The payment of this contribution would not, however, entitle the employee as of right to all the benefits of membership of the trade union andit would not constitute a contract of membership.,   where an individual had an/objection38!
objection on conscientious grounds both to belonging to a trade union and topaying any contribution to its funds there would be provision to allow him tocontribute the appropriate amount to an appropriate charity.156. Disputes about the level of the appropriate contribution to be paid by anon-member, about whether an employee has a genuine conscientious objection tocontributing to a trade union&apos;s funds, and about what is an &quot;appropriate charity&quot;,would be for determination by an Industrial Tribunal.Yllg:   Wages Councils157, The Government believes that greater progress can now be made in promoting the growth of voluntary arrangements for collective bargaining in Wages Councilsindustries, and accelerating the abolition of councils which have outlived theirusefulness, by amending the Y/ages Councils Act, 1959, and the Terms andConditions of Employment Act, 1959, broadly on the lines recommended by the donovan Commission!158. As recommended by the Donovan Commission it is proposed to amend the wages councils Act to provide that trade unions should be able to apply unilaterallyfor the abolition of a council, provided that the union or unions arerepresentative of a substantial proportion of the workers in the trade or industry concerned.   (The Secretary of State would retain his present power totake the initiative in proposing the abolition of a Council despite the absenceof any application).159. It is proposed that the Act should be amended to provide that the onlycondition to be satisfied before a wages council can be abolished should be thatthe council is no longer necessary to maintain reasonable standards of remuneration among the workers within its scope.160. Under present legislation, questions concerning the establishment,abolition or variation of the field of operation of a wages council areresolved by reference to ad hoc commissions of inquiry consisting of independent members and representatives of employers and workers.   The establishment of theCIR now makes it unnecessary to set up ad hoc bodies to decide these questions.
It is proposed therefore that the Act should.be amended to..provide that the CIR......should have power to perform all the functions at present undertaken by ad hoccommissions of inquiry.l6l. The present legislation specifies in detail the criteria, concerning theextent and adequacy of existing negotiating machinery, to be applied by ad hoccommissions of inquiry.   With the change in the grounds for abolition and thesubstitution of the CIR for ad hoc commissions of inquiry, these provisions would no longer be relevant and it is proposed to remove them from the ActD162. It is proposed that the employers&apos; side and the wages council concerned asa whole (ie including the independent members) should be consulted before action is taken to abolish a council.    In cases of doubt or dispute the issue would bereferred to the CIR.163. Section 8 of the Terns and Conditions of Employment Act, 1959s which providefor the adjudication of the present Industrial Court - the future arbitration board - on a claim that an employer is not observing &quot;recognised&quot; terms andconditions of employment, denies access to the Court if the claim concernsworkers whose remuneration, or minimum remuneration, is fixed by or under anyother enactment.   It is proposed to remove this exclusion so far as workerscovered by wages councils are concerned,I64. However, only registered trade unions would in future have the right(in wages councils industries as elsewhere) to put claims&apos;order Section 8to the Arbitration Board,,AO
VIII    NATIONAL EMERGENCIES AND STRIKE BALLOTSi65-      Disputes sometimes arise where - whatever the merits anddemerits of the case - the Government&apos;s prime duty and responsi-bility is to protect the public interest.    At present,  this canbe done only by proclaiming a State of Emergency and,  in thelast resort,   calling upon the armed services to secure essential supplies and services-    The value of this safeguard is limited by the fact that the Emergency Powers Act 1920 cannot be invokedsolely on the ground that the national economy is endangered.166.      The Government regards this situation as unsatisfactory and proposes that the Secretary of State should have additional powers to intervene in disputes which may seriously threaten the national health,   safety,  or economy and/or the livelihood ofa substantial portion of the community.    He would,  however,have to act through the NIRC;  he would have no new power to intervene directly.    The present provisions of the emergency powers Act would remain.Villa: National Emergencies167.      The Government proposes that inhere industrial action has begun,  or is likely to take place, which would deprive thecommunity of the essentials of life or seriously endanger thenational health,  security,  or economy,   the Secretary of state should be able to apply to the NIRC for a restraining orderagainst any union,   employer,  or employers&apos;   association,  or anyother person.168.      Before applying for such an order the Secretary of state should take account of the extent to which agreed or customaryprocedures for settling disputes had been adequately applied andwould have to give those concerned opportunity to make representations .41
//169.   Un^B^Sfe the Court, after considering the application in relation tothe criteria, were not satisfied that&quot;: there were grounds for the application,it would make an order restraining the named organisations and/or persons from taking steps to call, induce, or finance the industrial action.   Anystrike calls already issiied would he required to be withdrawn^170.     The order would be effective for a period of up to 60 days - duringwhich the Court would be able to make appropriate orders (expiring at thesame time as the original order) against other organisations or personswho were found to be instigating action relating to the same dispute.While the orders were in force all appropriate action would be taken to effect a settlement.    The order could be renewed within the limit of 60 daysif the initial order were for a shorter period, but could not be extendedbeyond, or renewed at or after, the end of the period.171.     The order would not compel individuals to return to, or to remain at, work,    there would be no sanctions against any individual solely on theground that he participated in industrial action.    This conforms to thegeneral principles set out in Part II.HI lb:   Strike, ^Ballots172.     There are sometimes cases where industrial action would deprive thecommunity, or a substantial part of it, of the essentials of life, or seriously endanger the national health, security or economy or the safety orlivelihood of a substantial portion of the community, out where there isdoubt whether such industrial action has the support of the majority of employees affected.    In such circumstances the Government propose that the1Secretary of State, after giving any organisation concerned in the disputean opportunity to make representations, should be able to apply to theNIRC for an order for a secret ballot to be held.42
173.     The NIRC after considering the application in relationto the criteria, would make such an order unless it were not satis-fied that there were grounds for it.J   Before making the order,the NIRC would be able to consult the CIR about its terms.   It wouldthen require the CIR to arrange the ballot, after consulting theunion(s) and eraployer(s) concerned.   The order would prohibitcalling or inducing industrial action over the matter at issue till the ballot was held.   Once again, however, the order would not compelindividual employees to return to or remain at work.\]h.   The CIR may conduct the ballot itself or arrange for it to be conducted, according to specified rules, by the union concerned.   Theissue to be decided would be whether or not a majority of the employeeconcerned were in favour of industrial action on the matters and inthe circumstances specified in the NIRCs order.   The order would also make clear who was to be balloted.175.   The ballot result would be notified to the CIR, the national industrial Relations court, and the Secretary of State, and would bepublished.176.   The result of the ballot would not be binding and the NIRCsorder would lapse once the ballot had been held.IX SCOPE AND INTERPRETATION---------------      177,   In general it is proposed to exclude from the scope of theproposals in this document:(i) workers ordinarily employed outside Britain, exceptwhen they are in Britain (but merchant seamen employed on british ships and ordinarily resident in Britain will be covered);(ii) the armed forces and the police.43
It is also proposed to exclude from certain of the proposals (eg those on unfair dismisals) s(i)   part-time workers employed less than 21 hours a week;(ii)   employees in small establishments (whose definition mightvary for different parts of the provisions);(iii)   workers employed by their husband or wife or a closerelatives(iv)   share fishermen wholly remunerated by a share of the catch.178.   In general it is proposed that the    provisions should applyto parsons employed under a contract personally to do work (ie certainsorts of self-employed people) in the same way as to those employed undera contract of employment? except where (eg in relation to unfair dismissal)this is clearly inappropriate.179&apos;  The Government is consulting with the Government of NorthernIreland about how far (if at all) the proposed legislation should applyto Northern Ireland.spartment of Employment andProductivity25 September 197044
