DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 56 COPY NO      ^ ,24 September 1970CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  BRITISH RAIL COMMUTER services memorandum by the Minister of transport. The previous Government announced in July 1968 its policy to achieve a break**even for British Rail (BR) London area commuter services by 1973.    Later they announced that their target was under reviewfollowing criticism by the Prices and Incomes Board that their targetwas optimistic,,2. The published PESC forecasts however incorporated the earlierobjective.3, The relevant services of BR are running at a loss of  15 million in 1970.    Our latest estimate is that to achieve the original target requires a total fares increases of about 30 per cent (in real terms) over 1971-73.This would be 45 per cent in money terms.4.        Any smaller increases would mean bigger bids on public expenditure.5, There will be considerable public opposition to the scale of fare increases needed to meet viability.    But there is a lot tobe said for aiming for viability by 1973.    This gets the big increasesout of the way early on, gives the biggest immediate public expendituresavings, and the minimum need for increases in the latter part of thefive-year period,6.        I am arranging urgent discussions with the Greater london council (GLC) and BR to:a. See whether more can be done by BR to reduce costs and increase efficiency.b. See whether there is scope for further involvement ofthe GLC in helping to solve BR&apos;s problems.CGrvJFSDEMTIAL
7,        There is no alternative however to some substantial fares increases in the next two years and I think the aim of viability by 1973 for the london area services is sound.    In the meantime I think my colleagues should know of the implications.J ministry of Transport SE123 September 19702
