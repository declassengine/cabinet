Printed for the Cabinet. November 1963CP. (63) 24 Copy No.  5^26th November, 1963CABINETTHE ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORY, WOOLWICHMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarThe FactoryThe Royal Ordnance Factory (R.O.F.), Woolwich, is a medium-to-heavygeneral engineering factory with some 3,800 employees. It is equipped toundertake a wide range of work on weapons and military equipment, with special facilities for the manufacture of guns. Its annual productive capacity is some 7-3 million a year, excluding ammunition for which it has further capacity of 2-1 million. It is one of four factories in the Weapons and Fighting Vehicles(W.F.V.) Group of R.O.Fs., the other three being Leeds (which makes tanks),Enfield (which makes small arms) and Nottingham, which is equipped to make thesame general range of products as Woolwich.Future Needs2. A departmental review of the factories in the W.F.V. group and of thework likely to be available for them in the next 10 years has recently been carriedout. The resulting recommendations were confirmed by a further independentreview carried out at the request of my predecessor by Sir Eric Mensforth,Chairman of Firth Brown Tools Limited and of Westland Aircraft Limited, whovisited all the factories and took evidence from their staffs and from the WarOffice. The main conclusions affecting R.O.F., Woolwich, were:(1) The ammunition capacity of Woolwich ( 2-1 million a year) could readily be taken up by the Ammunition Group of R.O.Fs.(2) For guns and engineering work the maximum foreseeable requirement,after allowing for all possible foreign orders, was in the region of 4-5 million a year, against a combined capacity of Woolwich andNottingham of  12 million a year.(3) Either Woolwich (capacity  7-3 million) or Nottingham (capacity 4-7 million) could meet all foreseeable requirements, with enough in reserve to meet all the needs of the forces in any war now envisaged.(4) Closing Nottingham would be a comparatively simple matter and would produce annual savings of some  800,000: closing Woolwich wouldinvolve capital expenditure of some  500,000 in transferring certainfacilities to Nottingham but would produce annual savings of some 1,300,000.Conclusion3. The conclusion that, by any standard of industrial efficiency, R.O.F.Woolwich should be closed is inescapable. Not only is the saving obtainedsubstantially greater than the alternative of closing Nottingham but the latter course would leave us with a less economic production unit for the programmewe foresee. Because of the natural reluctance to close a factory with the history and traditions of Woolwich, which has been making munitions for two and a halfcenturies, and at the height of its activity in 1917 employed some 73,000 workers,I had a further examination made of the possibility of reducing the size of bothNottingham and Woolwich so as to keep both in operation at low levels of activity.It emerged that this course would involve heavy capital expenditure, produce an uneconomic division of work and present formidable managerial difficulties:it could not be regarded as a defensible solution.3558THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Timing of Closure4. The rundown of Woolwich and the transfer of facilities to Nottinghamwould have to be spread over a considerable period, to avoid interference with production programmes. If a decision were taken now, it is thought that Woolwichcould, be finally closed by about mid-1966. The rundown of labour would bespread over this period. There would be some 3,000 redundancies in all, theremaining 800 workers being required for the administration of other government establishments remaining in the area.Views of the Home Affairs Committee5. The Home Affairs Committee have considered the position and have concluded that the right course is to close Woolwich in 1966. They felt however that the Cabinet should have an opportunity of examining the issues involved.They suggested that an announcement should be deferred so that plans for dealingwith the resultant redundancy could be announced at the same time.Timing of Announcement6. The fact that the future of this group of factories has been under reviewhas been publicly announced. We have for some time been under heavy pressure from local M.Ps., the Staff Associations and the Trade Unions to announce theresults. Further, some 500 workers will be redundant early in the New Year(whether the factory is to be closed or not) and, to allow for the required period of warning, this redundancy ought to be announced early in December if unnecessaryexpenditure is to be avoided. It would however be most undesirable to announce a large redundancy of this order without being in a position to announce the futureof the factory. I am discussing urgently with the Minister of Labour the terms of astatement about plans for resettling redundant workers which could be issued earlyin December.7.   I seek the Cabinefs agreement to:(a) the closure of Royal Ordnance Factory, Woolwich, in 1966;(b) an announcement to this effect early next month.J. R.War Office, S.W.1,26th November, 1963.
