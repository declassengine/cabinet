S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)EARNINGS RULE FOR WIDOWS1 pensions memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Committee on Pensions and National Insurance, of whichI am Chairman, have considered how to handle pressures in this session for abolition of the earnings rule for widowed mothers&apos;allowances.2.      National insurance provides benefit when a person&apos;s incomefails by reason of age, sickness, unemployment or widowhood.   hence the earnings rules by which widowed mothers&quot; allowances, andretirement and widows&apos; pensions are reduced where earnings exceedcertain levels.    These were fixed last May at  4, 5s. Od. a week(previously  3. 10s. Od. ) for retirement and widowed pensioners and  6 (previously  5) for widowed mothers.3.      The main pressure is for abolition of the earnings rule forwidowed mothers, as a case commanding special sympathy.    Thiswould cost about   1^ million a year.    The benefit would go to womenmany of whom are in professions.    A Bill would be needed.4.      A Private Member may well introduce such a Bill, or evenone extending also to the widows earnings rule (cost  7 million a year).This happened last Session, but v/e had then our own national insurance Bill which had greater attraction.5,      It has been argued in the Committee that our best tacticswould be to introduce a Government Bill to abolish the widowed mothers&apos; rule.    This would rest on the argument that widowed mothers are a special case, already recognised as such in having a higher earnings limit.6.      But the balance of opinion in the Committee is againstabolition of the widowed mothers&apos; earnings rule because -(a) this would be inconsistent with a fundamentalprinciple pf a Beveridge scheme?(b) there are no tenable grounds for abolishing thewidowed mothers&apos; rule and keeping the widows&apos;and retirement pensioners&apos; rule, and we have often said sojSiPj63)JL312th November, 1963CABINET-1-
(c) abolition of all three earnings rules would cost over 100 million a year;(d) if there is money for a concession to widow/ed mothers,all of them, not merely the better off ones, shouldbenefit;(e) (d) is the view of the National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee, and they are likely to make much ofit if the Government, having gone against it lastMay, do so again;(f) a policy of relating benefit to need implies retaining the earnings rules, not abolishing or relaxingthem;(g) abolition now, after we have so consistentlyrefused, would look like an election bribe.7.       The Committee found that most of these objections appliedalso to the alternative possibility of relaxing, without abolishing,the earnings limits.8.      On balance they favoured firm resistance to the pressures,drawing on the arguments in paragraph 6.    But we should have tosupport this by following a consistent policy of giving selectivebenefits for those most in need; the Committee will be studyingwhat longer term measures of this kind might be adopted.    invite my colleagues to endorse this view.R.M.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.12th November, 1963
