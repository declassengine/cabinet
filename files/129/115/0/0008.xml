confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. November 1963CP. (63) 8 Copy No.11th November, 1963CABINETSOUTH AFRICA: UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL debate on APARTHEIDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in my Memorandum CP. (63) 61 described the situation which was developingin the United Nations on this subject in New York.2. Since then the United Kingdom Permanent Representative at the united nations, Sir Patrick Dean, has had further discussions with the United States and norway, with the object of reaching agreement on a moderate draft which weshould be able to support. The Norwegians have communicated to us the text ofa draft resolution as at Annex.3. The most difficult feature of this draft from our point of view is operativeparagraph 4, which calls, although in non-mandatory terms, for an embargo byall States on the sale and shipment of materials and equipment for the manufactureof arms and ammunition in South Africa. The United States are prepared to accept this, but propose in doing so to make it clear that they intend to place their owninterpretation on it, and to relate it to equipment and materials obviously andexclusively designed for the manufacture of weapons and ammunition.Sir Patrick Dean has been authorised to continue discussions with the UnitedStates and Norway on the basis of this draft, but has been instructed that, as our policy stands at present, we could not support operative paragraph 4. It would therefore be for him to seek a separate vote on this, while voting for the resolutionas a whole, and even, if he fails to secure this, to make it clear that had a separatevote been taken, we would have abstained on that paragraph. He would have to add that it would be impracticable to distinguish between materials for armsproduction and others and that we regard this paragraph as a recommendationonly.4. This authority should enable Sir Patrick Dean to hold the position withthe United States and Norway for the time being. It will however be necessary tosend him further instructions early next week. It is almost certain that if we areto succeed in persuading the United States and Norway to keep in line with us onthe basis of a moderate draft, we shall have to go one step further. This might involve voting for the resolution as a whole, without abstaining on operativeparagraph 4. We would then say in our explanation of vote that our intention wasto prevent the export to South Africa of arms, and equipment and material forthe production of arms, to be used for repression in South Africa, while avoidingunacceptable dislocation to our trade generally. We should make it clear that we regarded this operative paragraph as a recommendation only, and that we intendedto place our own interpretation on it. In practice this would not involve us in doing more than preventing the export, subject to existing contracts, of specialisedmachinery and equipment for the production of repressive weapons. As in thecase of arms, we should use the export licensing machinery to ensure this.5. I realise all the difficulties involved in what may appear as a slightextension of our present policy but we must be clear what the alternative is likely3449
to be if Sir Patrick Dean is unable to proceed on this basis with the United Statesand Norway. In that event we shall be separated from them and they will doubtless be prepared to negotiate on the basis of an Afro-Asian draft. This would containnot only a demand for a total embargo on arms and armament materials, but would also call for economic sanctions in some form. It is not to be excluded thatthe United States and Norway would vote for this resolution as a whole, whileabstaining on some of its provisions. At the most the United States would abstainon the resolution as a whole and it would then carry. It would almost certainly be drafted in terms of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, i.e., it would decide the existence of a threat to peace and security. This would then form astrong legal basis for a subsequent demand in mandatory terms for economic sanctions. In the worst case, if a resolution were tabled at this meeting inmandatory terms, we might have to veto with all that that would imply in theCommonwealth and with our friends in the Free World.6. I therefore recommend that Sir Patrick Dean should be authorised tosupport the Norwegian resolution, with a carefully worded explanation of voteas proposed in paragraph 4.R. A. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,8th November, 1963.AnnexFollowing is Text of Draft Resolution:BeginsThe Security CouncilHaving considered the race conflict in South Africa resulting from the policies of apartheid of the Government of the Republic of South Africa,Recalling previous resolutions of the Security Council and of the general assembly which have dealt with the racial policies of the Government of theRepublic of South Africa, and in particular the Security Council Resolution S/5386of August 9,1963,Having considered the Secretary-GeneraFs reports contained in S/5438,Deploring the refusal of the Government of the Republic of South Africa asconfirmed in the reply of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of South Africa to theSecretary-General received on October 11, 1963, to accept the repeatedrecommendations of the United Nations organs,Noting with appreciation the replies to the Secretary-GeneraPs communication to the member States on the action taken and proposed to be taken by their governments in the context of that resolution^ operative paragraph 3, and hoping that all the remaining member States as soon as possible will inform the Secretary-General about their willingness to carry out the provisions of that paragraph,Taking note of the reports of the special committee of the policies of apartheidof the Government of the Republic of South Africa contained in Document A/ 5497,Noting with deep satisfaction the overwhelming support for the resolutionA/RES/1881 (xviii) adopted by the General Assembly on October 11, 1963,Taking into account the serious concern of the member States with regardto the policy of apartheid as expressed in the general debate in the general assembly as well as in the discussions in the special political committee,
