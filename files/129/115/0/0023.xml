Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1963CP. (63) 23 Copy No, 5 126th November, 1963CABINETCENSUS OF POPULATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of HealthSince 1801 a population census has been taken in every tenth year (except1941). The Home Affairs Committee have accepted (H.P. (63) 5th Meeting, Item 4)that for certain purposes notably planning in the widest sense, housing policy andthe whole range of manpower policy a ten-year period is too long and thatcontemporary conditions and contemporary thinking make it necessary that theGovernment should provide themselves and the local authorities with more frequent information. The Census Act, 1920, makes it possible to take a populationcensus after five years, without further legislation.2. The Committee have considered whether a census in 1966 need, for thepurposes for which it is wanted, involve a full enumeration of every household inthe country. They have concluded that it need not and that (with the exception ofcertain &quot; special study &quot; areas in Scotland) a 10 per cent sample census would suffice.3. The determining factors in this decision are two cost and the thresholdof accuracy required. Estimates of cost, for Great Britain at present prices, are about  1 million for a 10 per cent sample census and about  4 million for a fullcensus. A 10 per cent sample will provide usable data for broad central planning purposes, concerned with relatively large areas and populations. Its results will notbe really useful for detailed consideration of areas of less than 50,000 population.The Committee consider that below that threshold the greater accuracy providedby a full census would not, at the mid-decade, be worth  3 million.4. But in half a dozen areas in Scotland which are to be the subject of specialeconomic studies the smallness of the populations concerned will demand 100 percent data. Consideration is being given to the possibility of a very few selectedareas in England and Wales being similarly treated.5.   The programme contemplated is:(1) an announcement in Parliament, before the Christmas recess, of theGovernment^ intentions. Accompanying publicity would present the quinquennial census as a natural part of our national and regional economic and social planning;(2) a limited pre-test in the earlier part of next year, involving a few thousandhouseholders willing to participate. This is essential if the samplingprocedures, hitherto untried, are to be reliable;(3) formal Parliamentary authorisation of a 1966 census, preferably next yearand not later than the New Year, 1965.6. Because this is a new venture, with some political implications, the HomeAffairs Committee felt that the Cabinet should be informed of what is proposedbefore any announcement is made.M. A. C. N.A.
