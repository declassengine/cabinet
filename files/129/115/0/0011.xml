frinted for the Cabinet.   November 1963CP. (63) 11 Copy No. 5112th November, 1963&quot;cabinetTRIBUNALS OF INQUIRY (EVIDENCE) ACT, 1921Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and the Secretary of State for scotland at their meeting on 30th May, 1963 (C.C. (63) 36th Conclusions, Minute 4),the Cabinet had before them our memorandum (C. (63) 97) of 27th May, 1963, aboutthe procedure under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921. Thememorandum recalled that in the course of the debates in both Houses on thereport of the Radcliffe Tribunal on the Vassall case, criticisms were made of theprocedure under the 1921 Act; and that the Leader of the Opposition had suggestedthat the Government should consider appointing a Select Committee to considerthe whole working of the Act, including questions such as costs, Press secrecy,and the disclosure of sources. The then Leader of the House undertook thatthis possibility would be considered (Official Report for 7th May, 1963, column 371).2. Our previous memorandum discussed the main criticisms which havebeen made of the tribunal procedure: indicated the extent to which they have inpractice been overcome: and concluded that no inquiry was necessary. TheCabinet reached no final conclusion, and we have since discussed the matter onthe basis of a further study by officials, of which a copy is attached with our colleagues principally concerned. In that consideration we have taken account ofthe comments by Lord Denning on methods of inquiry, to which attention seems likely to be called in any debate on his report. These are:&quot; It has been much debated what is the best way to deal with matters such as those referred to me. The appointment of a tribunal under the tribunals of Inquiries Act, 1921, is an elaborate and costly machine, equipped with all the engines of the law counsel, solicitors, witnesses on oath, absoluteprivilege, openness to the public (so far as possible) and committal forcontempt but it suffers from the invincible drawback, in doing justice, thatthere is no prosecution, no charge, and no defence. The appointment of a select Committee of one or both Houses of Parliament is a very representative body, but it is said to suffer from the drawback (to some eyes) that theinquisitors are too many and may be influenced in their, often divergent, viewsby political considerations, so that there may be too much dissent to carryauthority. Now there is this inquiry which I have been entrusted with alone.It has the advantage that there can be no dissent, but it has two greatdisadvantages; first, being in secret, it has not the appearance of justice;second, in carrying out the inquiry, I have had to be detective, inquisitor,advocate and judge, and it has been difficult to combine them. But I have come to see that it has three considerable advantages. First, inasmuch as ithas been held in private and in strict confidence, the witnesses were, I am sure,much more frank than they would otherwise have been. Secondly, I was able to check the evidence of one witness against that of another more freely.Thirdly, and most important, aspersions cast by witnesses against others (whoare not able to defend themselves) do not achieve the publicity which is inevitable in a Court of Law or Tribunal of Inquiry.&quot;3462THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT
TII;i?l*&apos; Weare agreed that the inquisitorial method of inquiry by a tribunal mustbe retained for use in cases in which the public interest requires some matter ofimportance to be impartially investigated by a body having the necessary powers.The Act of 1921, as experience has shown, makes it possible to have a completelyflexible procedure which can be adapted to the various circumstances in whichinquiries may be held. The adaptations which have been made have, in fact, net the  main criticisms hitherto offered. No precisely formulated code would be suitablefor cases so widely different as those in which this method of inquiry is likely tobe used. Subject therefore to the important question of publicity, we do hot&apos;think there is any need to amend the Act or any probability that an inquiry into itsworking would lead to useful proposals for doing so.4. The question of publicity is difficult. A tribunal set up under the Act of1921 can exclude the public if it considers that it is in the public interest expedient to do so &quot; for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry or the natureof the evidence to be given &quot;. In cases such as the Vassall Inquiry the Tribunalsits in private for security reasons, but the scope for private sittings under the Actis probably fairly narrow. In general, therefore, the hearings are bound to be heldin public, and innocent persons may be damaged in their reputation by allegationsmade against them (and reported in the Press) which they cannot rebut, and whichare only shown to be unfounded when the tribunal eventually reports. This isregrettable; but we fear that if any impression of a desire for secrecy or the suppression of facts is to be avoided, the public interest requires that the hearingsby a body so exceptional as a tribunal set up under the Act of 1921 must continueto be in public.5. On the merits, therefore, we remain of the view that no inquiry is necessary.The question which we ask our colleagues to consider is whether it is, nevertheless,desirable to offer one in order to satisfy those who have misgivings about thetribunal method, and to avoid the risk that if we do not offer an inquiry we maybe driven by pressure to set one up. We are agreed that if there were to be an inquiry it should be by a Royal Commission; and we suggest that the terms ofreference should be, broadly, to inquire into the operation of the Tribunals of inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921: to consider whether it ought to be retained with or without amendments and, if so, whether any modification of the procedureshitherto followed at inquiries is necessary or desirable: and whether there shouldbe some alternative method of investigating minor cases.H. B.M. N.11th November, 1963.
Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)Act 1921Note by officials on the 214th July a meeting of Ministers, attended &quot;by theLord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State forScotland, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the attorney-General, was held to consider further the need for revision of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Ant, 1921, orfor the institution of some form of enquiry into its working.The meeting decided to ask officials to prepare a Report aboutthe Act, which Ministers could consider at a further meeting tobe held before the end of the Summer Recess.   Ministers willrecall that a previous note by officials on this subject was prepared in 1959;    and that it was dealt with more recently inthe memorandum submitted to the Cabinet on 27th May, 1963* by theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C(63)97)*The Cabinet decided on the 30th May to resume their discussionof this paper at a later meeting (C.C.(63) 36th Conclusion L).2.     Ministers will also recall that, as paragraph 1 ofC(63)97 explains, the procedure under the Act of 1921 was criticised during the debates in both Houses on the report of the radcliffe Tribunal.   The suggestion was made by the Oppositionthat the Government should consider appointing a select committeeto review the whole working of the Act, including questions suchas costs, Press secrecy and disclosure of sources.   Anundertaking was given to consider this possibility.   There havebeen subsequent Parliamentary Questions to which temporisinganswers have &quot;been given.    It seems likely that the matter willbe raised again, perhaps in the context of the debate on lord Denning&apos;s report, early in the new session.3-     It is relevant, therefore, to take note of comments made byLord Denning in paragraph 5 of that report about the various forms of inquiry which might have been used to deal with thematters referred to him.   The paragraph is in the following terms:-&quot;It has been much debated what is the best way todeal with matters such as those referred to me.    Theappointment of a tribunal under the Tribunals ofInquiries Act, 1921i is an elaborate and costly machine,equipped with all the engines of the law - counsel,solicitors, witnesses on oath, ahsolute privilege,openness to the public (so far as possible) andcommittal for contempt - but it suffers from theinvinciole drawback, in doing justice, that there isno prosecution, no charge, and no defence.   Theappointment of a Select Committee of one or bothHouses of Parliament is a very representative body, butit is said to suffer from the drawback (to some eyes)that the inquisitors are too many and may be influencedin their, often divergent, views by political considera-tions, so that there may &quot;be too much dissent to carryauthority.   Now there is this inquiry which I have been entrusted with alone.    It has the advantage that therecan &quot;be no dissent, but it has two great disadvantages;first, being in secret, it has not the appearance ofjustice;   second, in carrying out the inquiry, I have
EThad to be detective, inquisitor, advocate and judge, andit has been difficult to combine them.    But I have come tosee that it has three considerable advantages.   First,inasmuch as it has been held in private and in strict confidence, the witnesses were, I am sure, much morefrank than they would otherwise have been.    Secondly, Iwas able to check the evidence of one witness against thatof another more freely.   Thirdly, and most important,aspersions cast by witnesses against others (who are notable to defend themselves) do not achieve the publicity which is inevitable in a Court of Law or Tribunal of Inquiry&quot;,,I4.     Another relevant consideration is the inclusion in the PoliceBill of a clause empowering the Secretary of State to order localinquiries into any matter connected with the policing of any area.The person holding an inquiry under this new power would be ableto compel the attendance of witnesses and take evidence on oath.The inquiry would be held in public or in private as the Secretaryof State may direct.    Of the sixteen inquiries so far held underthe Act of 1921 (of which a list is appended to this note) five(indicated by an asterisk) nave been into matters which would be covered by the new powerv5.     Lord Denning&apos;s comments, public reaction to his Report and thenew police legislation may prompt the question whether it isnecessary to contemplate the use in future of a tribunal armed with the powers and protected with the privileges of the 1921 Act,If such tribunals were dispensed with, and matters of urgent public importance which require special investigation were dealt with onthe lines of the Denning inquiry, the problems canvassed in (6.3)97 would disappear.6.     We suggest that it would be unrealistic to assume that nosituation requiring investigation in the form of an inquiryconducted in public by a body armed with powers to compelwitnesses and to take evidence on oath, will ever arise in thefuture.   The circumstances which led to the appointment ofLord Denning were exceptional and do not require re-stating.Those circumstances and, it may be said, the stature andpersonality of Lord Denning himself were such as to contribute to the success of the inquiry in the following ways, which maynot be repeated on future occasions:-(a)    The witnesses whom Lord Denning wished to see were willing to attend and speak frankly.    It is possiblethat on another occasion important witnesses mightrefuse to give evidence, not only because of the risk to their own reputations bufc because of the risk ofan action of defamation being brought against them.The latter risk arises because witnesses are notprotected by the absolute privilege given by the act of 1921.   Lord Denning&apos;s assurance to witnesses couldnot give the same protection.(d)   Lord Denning &quot;was able to check the evidence of onewitness against another more freely&quot; than would havebeen possible at a formal public hearing (seeparagraph 5 of the Report).   This advantage, which maybe set against the absence of cross-examination by counsel, also depended on the willingness of witnessesto see Lord Denning on several occasions, when required.It is easy to think of circumstances in which thisadvantage would be absent and cross-examination would bedesirable in the interests of ascertaining the truth.tpB3
(c) The findings of Lord Denning appear to have commandedgeneral acceptance, in spite of the fact that theevidence has not been published and was not subjected to cross-examination.     Again, there is a risk thatthis would not happen on a future occasion, evenassuming that a member of the judiciary of comparableauthority were available.     Although publication was particularly undesirable in this case, it would usuallybe embarrassing to have to publish the evidence taken at an informal hearing.     But on future occasionsthere might be strong pressure to do so.(d) Lord Denning was able to achieve a very large measureof anonymity, and this has avoided damage to reputationsand lessened the risk of actions for defamation being brought against those responsible for the publicationof the Report, and persons whose evidence would otherwise oe identifiable.     Such a degree of anonymitymight obviously not be possible or acceptable on futureoccasions.7c     The procedure adopted in this case was no doubt justified bythe exceptional circumstances;    but it is impossible to ignore the burden which was placed upon Lord Denning personally.      Itmust clearly be a matter for the most careful consideration whether in any particular case in future it is in the publicinterest to put any member of the judiciary in such a position,to ask him to act as detective,  inquisitor, advocate and judge,and not to act in accordance with ordinary legal principles,and yet inevitably to expose him to the buffets of political controversy.3.     We think therefore that there may always be cases of such a nature and importance that Parliamentary and public opinion wouldnot accept as adequate a private enquiry by an individual withoutpowers to compel witnesses and take evidence on oath.     TheBudget Leak and Bank Rate Inquiries, for example, might havebeen difficult ones to entrust to an informal privateinvestigation.9.     We have therefore assumed that Ministers will take the viewthat there must be some procedure by which a full, impartial and complete investigation can be made of any circumstances whichare causing grave public disquiet and concern, and where thefacts are hid.den, concealed or complicated and cannot be fullyascertained by the ordinary processes of law.     The laws oflibel are said to be inadequate to deal with such circumstancesbecause they are concerned only with statements which have beenactually published about particular individuals.     They cannotdeal with gossip or be used at all when allegations are made against public bodies like Government Departments.     Nor isthe criminal law by itself sufficient, because there may nothave been enough evidence for a prosecution, or no crime at all-3-SECRET
CR168may have been committed.      It is said that the principalfunction of whatever investigatory process is used is toenable the facts to be discovered.      In some instances, the radcliffe Report in the Vassall case is a noteworthy example,the Tribunal stated the facts as it found them, drew suchconclusions as were necessitated &quot;by their terms of reference,and left it to Parliament and the public to consider whetherit would have drawn the same conclusions from those facts.10.    It seems to us impossible to decide in advance whether inany given situation calling for an inquiry it is necessary toestablish a tribunal armed with full powers, or whether thematter can be dealt with less formally on the lines followedby Lord Denning.      If this is right, there appears to be noescape from retaining on the statute book the Tribunals of inquiry (Evidence) Act,  1921;    and it is, therefore, necessaryto look at the main criticisms of the procedure under that Actand consider whether it is desirable to arrange for someimpartial review of it.11     The main criticisms of the Act of 1921 may be summarisedas followsTnese defects appear to he inherent in tribunalprocedure.   Their existence points to the desirabilityof setting up tribunals only where it is absolutely necessary in the public interest to do so, and ofgiving them terms of reference as precise as possible.The need for the greatest care has been repeatedlystressed.    Lord Shawcross in the Waters Debate,(0,R. lhth May 1959? Col. 1+69) suggested that ministers should exercise the greatest discrimination in using the machinery of the 1921 Act and should use it only if,it appearing that other legal methods are notavailable, they are satisfied that some matter not ofParliamentary advantage hut of public interestnecessitates the fullest public investigation.   the accepted principle is the necessity to restore public confidence in public conduct and administration.(ii)   Wholly innocent and respectable people may becomeinvolvedThis is probably the most unsatisfactory feature of the tribunal procedure.   Allegations are made and(i)The inquisitorial nature of the procedure is unfairan individual has no benefit of the presumption of-UrSECHET
suspicions are aroused and given wide publicityduring the proceedings and may not be properlydisposed of until the tribunal reports,     this raises the question whether a tribunal should sit in private, or whether,  if it sits in public,  thereshould be some ban on the publication of its proceedings until after its report has been published.     We return to this question inparagraph 13.(iii)      Innocent people may become involved in heavy expenditure in being legally represented beforethe tribunal     &quot;&quot; &quot; &quot;     &quot;      &quot;The Act makes no provision for the payment of expenses.     But before the sittings of the WatersTribunal began the Secretary of State, with Treasuryconsent, agreed to pay the expenses of the Watersfamily and ex gratia contributions are being made,on the advice of the recent Radcliffe tribunal,towards the costs incurred by persons who appeared before it.     There is a case for amending the Actto provide for the payment of costs;   but in thelight of recent practice this does not appear tobe a matter of urgency.(iv)   The actual procedure before the tribunal, including such matters as the leading of evidence by counsel,the cross-examination of witnesses, and the part played by the Attorney-General, is open to criticismAfter the earlier tribunals there were manycriticisms of this kind.      It had been complained that the Attorney-General!s opening of the case before the Tribunal was hostile to particularindividuals and was left unanswered sometimes foran appreciable interval:    that there was a lack of opportunity by Counsel appearing for individuals tomake any corresponding statement on their behalf.The role of the Attorney-General has been criticised in that he may be thought to be influenced by political considerations in one direction or in theother by his desire not to fall short in severity:specifically, that he should not be asked to conductboth examinations in chief and cross-examinations ofthe same individuals.     Apart from the desirabilityor otherwise of the Attorney-General appearing at allin these enquiries, we consider that the proceduraldifficulties ?/ere largely disposed of by the methodsadopted before the Radcliffe Tribunal.      Indeed manyof the problems inherent in&apos;the Tribunal procedure,harmful publicity for example, did not arise in thecircumstances of the Radcliffe Inquiry because^ as wehave said,  so much of the proceedings were conducted in private for security reasons.     Nevertheless, there seems no reason why in any further public inquiry theprocedure adopted by the Attorney-General and Counselbefore the Radcliffe Tribunal should not form asatisfactory precedent.      (The foregoing remarks would apply equally to the Lord Advocate in relation to proceedings before a Tribunal sitting in Scotland,)-5-SECRET
We consider that, as Tribunals have to dealwith very different types of case, it would therefore be unwise, and probably impracticable, to lay down in the statute rules of procedure applicableto all cases.     As to the position of the Attorney-General, it seems appropriate that he should appearas counsel for the tribunal in the most importantcasesi   but it is not required by the Act that heshould do so, and it may be noted that in thecircumstances of the Waters Tribunal in i 959 theLord Advocate decided that he could play no part.The tribunal in that case appointed their own counseland solicitor.     In any event, it seems preferable to keep the present flexible procedure rather than to devise statutory rules which might hamper thetribunal without providing any additional safeguards,A correlative of the need for this flexibility isthe importance of seeing that, so far as possible,the proceduie adopted is manifestly fair to allconcerned,(v) The tribunal ought not to have power to direct tothe High Court oases, of alleged [retxxsalJtjo answer questions &apos;     -----   -       ......-The Leader of the Opposition suggested in theVassall debate that if a tribunal was frustrated inits work by the refusal of a witness to disclose hissources it should report back to Parliament, whowould decide on the action to be taken.     Sir PrankSoskice, on the other hand, disagreed;    and mostspeakers recognised that the powers conferred by the1921 Act are necessary and must be enforceable, andthat there could be no exemption from their operation for journalists.     As the Attorney-General pointedout in answer to a Question on the Uth April, aperson appearing before a tribunal is under the sameduty to answer lawful questions as if he were awitness in the ordinary courts.     There would notappear to be any strong ground for exemptingwitnesses appearing before a tribunal from the sameduty as witnesses appearing in court to tell the truth about their sources of information when this is relevant and necessary.()    People who are shown by the evidence given in publicbefore&apos; a trihiui^charge ^cannot&quot; e as fly &quot;Fe&quot;pro s ejoutTeXITe oaus ethey have already been pupiTclLy^^triecT&quot;This appears to be an inescapable consequenceof any method of public inquiry.     The need toestablish the facts in the wider public interestmust take precedence over all other considerations.As Lord Somervell pointed out in the Waters Debate,it would be quite wrong to appoint a Tribunal underthe 1921 Act for the purpose of obtaining evidence to justify a prosecution, and it would be equallywrong to seek to lay down a principle that the truthshould not be investigated by such a proceduremerely because criminal offences may be involved.-6-8ECRET
12.   Subject, therefore, to consideration of the special problem of publicity, there does not appear to be any urgent need for amending the procedure which can be adopted under theAct of 1921, or any likelihood that an inquiry would lead toacceptable proposals for its amendment.     The Act leaves theprocedure entirely flexible;    and experience has shown that itcan be varied to meet varying circumstances in such a way asto avoid the main criticisms which were at one time brought against it.13.   The question of publicity is difficult.     There is no doubtthat a public hearing can do grave injury to innocent persons &quot;byexposing them to accusations which they cannot effectively rebut,and of which they are not acquitted until eventually the reportof the tribunal appears.     The leading example of the hardshipcaused to individuals was the Bank Rate Tribunal.     We doubt,however, whether it is possible to meet this difficulty withoutdefeating one of the purposes for which inquiries under the Actare held - namely, to investigate searchingly and so far aspossible publicly the urgent matter of public importance into which the tribunal has been appointed to inquire.     It is recognised that the clash between the public interest and theinterests of individuals is bound to occur in such inquiriesand that all that can be done is to endeavour to mitigate &apos;chedetriment to privaoe persons.II4.    The Act of 1921 recognises that there are circumstances in which it would be contrary to the public interest for thetribunal to take evidence in public;    and the RadcliffeTribunal did, of course, on security grounds hear a great dealof evidence in private.     The terms of the Act provide that theproceedings of the tribunal are to be in public unless in its opinion &quot;it is in the public interest expedient&quot; not to allow the public to be present &quot;for reasons connected with the subject matter of the inquiry, or the nature of the evidence to begiven&quot;0     This power to exclude the public is wide;    and it maybe assumed that, as in the case of the Radcliffe Tribunal, a tribunal will use it where it considers it right to do so.We have considered whether, in order to meet the criticism of possible injury to individuals, the tribunal might be given  an absolute discretion to sit in private.     We doubt, however,whether opinion would support this;    and if our doubts are well-founded we cannot readily suggest any criterion by whichthe case for sitting in private can be judged more likely tomeet the varying circumstances than that already embodied inthe statute.     We have considered also whether, in appropriate cases, Parliament might be invited, in the Resolution settingup the tribunal, to direct it to sit in private.     As already mentioned, it is proposed to give the Secretary of State a power to direct the person holding an inquiry into policematters to sit in private.     Again we doubt whether parliament would be prepared in cases not obviously within the ambit ofthe existing discretionary power to take such a decision.In some instances the paramount public interest may lie in the need to avoid any impression of secrecy.-7-c
15.   Another approach to the problem would be to prohibitpublication of the proceedings before a tribunal until thereport has been published.     The reaction to the recommendationof the Tucker Committee that committal proceedings before the magistrate should not he reported suggests that legislationrestraining the Press in this way would be controversial.Though there is a strong case for it, the present moment maynot be a very suitable one for advancing it.16.   A further suggestion which has sometimes been made is that before a tribunal is established there should be a preliminaryinquiry to determine whether there is a prima facie case, andthat this might he conducted in private.     We see&quot; littleadvantage in this.     If the preliminary inquiry reported thatthere was a prima facie case, nothing would be gained-    the setting up of the tribunal would have been delayed;    andwitnesses would have to be examined twice.      If on the otherhand the preliminary inquiry said there was no case, its conclusion, based on evidence taken in private, might well be questioned.     It seems wiser, especially as the purpose of a tribunal is to investigate an urgent matter of public jmportance,to let it get to work as quickly as possible.17.   On the whole, our conclusion is that a case for setting up an independent inquiry into the working of the 1921 Act has notbeen made out.     On the assumption that the public interestrequires some investigatory machinery in exceptional cases andthat it must in the nature of things be inquisitorial in character, we doubt whether any close examination of the problems involved will yield worthwhile results.18.   We were asked, however, to consider what form an inquiry into the problems presented by the Act might most appropriatelytake if Ministers decided to have one.19c    The various possibilities appear to be;-(a) a departmental committee,(b) a Royal Commission or(c) a joint select committee of both Houses of Parliament.20.   An inquiry &quot;by a departmental committee would probably bequickest.     Provided it was strongly constituted - includingperhaps representatives of the judiciary and Privy Counsellors -its report would carry authority.     It may be thought, however,that for the consideration of an issue of this importance a departmental committee lacks the necessary status;    and that itwould be inadvisable for a matter of such wide general interestto be investigated by a body appointed &quot;by, and reporting to, aparticular Minister.21.    These objections could hardly be made to the appointment ofa Royal Commission, for which officials suggested in the 1959report that there was much to be said.     It was then thought thatit might he presided over by the Lord Chief Justice, and includePrivy Counsellors.22,,    The &quot;broad argument in favour of a joint select committee isthat the matter to be investigated is of direct Parliamentaryconcern;    a tribunal is concerned with a matter of public importance and express Parliamentary authority is required forits appointment.     On the other hand, a joint select committee might, consciously and unconsciously, be influenced by political-8-
considerations in dealing with a matter which should he examined with judicial impartiality;    and the staff which would beavailable to it would have no experience of tribunals or of theproblems to which they give rise.23o    To sum up, our conclusions ares-(a) that there is no nrlma^facie case for the holding of an inquiry into&apos;the working of  the 1921 Act atpresent;   and(b) that if one is nevertheless to be held a RoyalCommission would be the best body to hold it.21 st October 1 9^3.-9-S EC RET
