KENYA INDEPENDENCE CONFERENCE, 1963REPORTThe Kenya Independence Conference met in London at LancasterHouse, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Duncan Sandys, Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, between 25th September and 19th October, 1963. Thepurpose of the Conference was to settle the form of Kenya&apos;s constitutionon independence. A list of those attending is at Annex E.2. The Conference held seven plenary meetings between 25th september and 30th September and agreed on a number of amendments to the con-stitution, including the provisions for citizenship. During the next threeweeks the Secretary of State for the Colonies held a series of privatediscussions with each of the Delegations separately.3. At a final plenary session of the Conference on 19th October, 1963,the Secretary of State reported the results of his discussions and explained the amendments which it had been decided to make to the constitution.(Annex A.)  Full particulars of these are given at Annex D.4. Mr. Sandys informed the Conference that he had received a letterfrom the Prime Minister of Kenya (Annex B), in which the latter statedthat his Government accepted these amendments as a settlement of the issues raised at the Conference, and that it was not his government&apos;s intention to seek to make further amendments to the constitution exceptin so far as subsequent experience showed these to be absolutely necessary.5. The Secretary of State also circulated to the Conference a secondletter which he had received from Mr. Kenyatta (Annex C), reaffirmingthe intention of the Kenya Government to transfer to the Regions, withall possible speed, the departments and services still remaining to be handed over. The letter contained a timetable which provided that thegreater part of these remaining transfers would be effected on 1st December,1963 and would be completed not later than 1st January, 1964.6. The Secretary of State noted that it was the wish of both parties in Kenya that, on attaining independence, Kenya should be a member ofthe Commonwealth. He assured them that if this were confirmed by aresolution of the National Assembly, the British Government would bepleased to convey this request to the Governments of other Common-wealth countries.7. The Kenya Government declared that it was their desire that queen elizabeth II should become Queen of independent Kenya. Mr. Sandysundertook to convey this request to Her Majesty.8. Finally Mr. Sandys confirmed that 12th December, 1963, would bethe day of Kenya&apos;s independence.
Annex ASTATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies at THE FINAL PLENARY SESSION&quot; In the plenary sessions during the first stage of the Conference, agree-ment was reached on most of the amendments and additions to the con-stitution which are necessary to effect Kenya&apos;s change of status from self-government to independence. Certain other amendments, mostly uncon-controversial, but by no means unimportant, were also agreed.2. In addition, the Government of Kenya proposed a number of further amendments which, they considered necessary, in order to make the con-stitution workable.3. The KADU Opposition delegation recognised in principle that, ifthe constitution was not workable, amendments which could be shown to be necessary must be made. However, they did not consider that thefurther amendments proposed by the Kenya Government were justified,and they therefore refused to discuss them. In their view all necessarydecisions of substance had been taken at the Lancaster House Conferencein 1962, at which the &quot; Framework &quot; of the constitution was agreed.4. It was thus clearly impossible to make further progress in plenarysessions. I therefore decided to pursue the discussions separately with each delegation, in an endeavour to reach agreement. These difficult andprotracted talks have been proceeding for 18 days, and the time has now come to take decisions.5. The Constitutional Framework, agreed between all parties in 1962,declared that the objective is &quot; a united Kenya nation, capable of social and economic progress in the modern world a Kenya in which men andwomen have confidence in the sanctity of individual rights and liberties,and in the proper safeguarding of the interests of minorities &quot;. Throughoutthese discussions, the problem has been to reconcile the first and the lastphrases of that declaration on the one hand, to create a united Kenyanation and on the other, to safeguard the interests of minorities.6. As was to be expected, the Kenya Government have been primarily concerned with national unity, and the Opposition with minority safe-guards. In support of their amendments, the Kenya Government have drawn attention to paragraph 7 of the Constitutional Framework, which states that &quot; there should be a strong and effective Central Government&quot;,whereas the Opposition have based themselves on paragraph 9, which states that &quot; there should be the maximum possible de-centralisation ofthe powers of Government to effective authorities capable of a life andsignificance of their own &quot;.7. As Secretary of State for the Colonies, I have during this part fortnight been acutely aware of the critical nature of the decisions to betaken, and of the heavy responsibility which rests upon me. In discharg-ing this task, I have been guided by one thought, only, to do what is best for the people of Kenya.
8. Throughout I have fully recognised that the Constitutional Frame-work of 1962 was approved by both the Kenya parties and by the BritishGovernment, and embodied a number of keenly debated compromises. Itwas, therefore, important that no changes should be made which conflictedwith the provisions of this basic document, unless they could be shown tobe not merely desirable, but necessary, in order to make the constitutionworkable.9. In the case of proposals for amendments which did not conflict withthe terms of the Framework, I felt that a somewhat more flexible approach was permissible. At the same time I considered it my duty to weighcarefully the possible effects of any changes upon the delicate checks andbalances which the constitution was designed to provide.10. On the basis of these criteria, I reached the conclusion that therewere a certain number of amendments which needed to be made. full particulars of these amendments have been circulatd to the Conference(Annex D). I will refer only to the most important of them namely those concerned with the police, the public service, and the procedure for amend-ing the constitution.11. Of all the amendments I had to consider, the most difficult were those relating to the Police. The difficulty arose from two conflictingconsiderations. On the one hand, I had to recognise that the maintenanceof law and order is one of the basic responsibilities of government andthat consequently the efficiency of the police organisation is a matter of vital importance. On the other hand, I was faced with the agreed Frame-work of 1962, which set out in the utmost detail a scheme for the distribu-tion of police control between the Central Government and the Regions. I took the view that, in the interests of public safety, any changes must bemade which were necessary to enable the police efficiently to performtheir duties. However, owing to the anxiety and suspicion which sur-rounds this question, I did not consider that I would be justified in making any amendments which were not essential for this purpose.12. Before coming to a decision, I asked the Inspector-General of the kenya Police Force to come to London and thoroughly discussed theproblem with him. As a result, I reached the conclusion that several ofthe amendments to the police organisation proposed by the Kenya Govern-ment, although desirable, could not be said to be absolutely necessary.On the other hand, a completely convincing case was made out for afew important changes.13. The first is concerned with the establishments of the central and Regional contingents of the police. In order to ensure that noRegion should build up an excessive police force, the Framework providedthat the maximum strength of each contingent should be laid down by theNational Security Council, which is composed of a Minister of the CentralGovernment and one representative of each of the seven Regions. But itis equally important that the overall strength of the police in Kenya shouldnot be allowed to fall below a reasonable level, and that all parts of thecountry should bear their fair share of the expense. For this reason, Iconsider that the National Security Council should be charged with theduty of fixing not merely the maximum strengths but the actual establish-ments of the Central and Regional contingents.
14. The second change relates to the transfer of police from one con-tingent to another. The Framework provided that, except in the case ofgazetted officers of whom there are only about two hundred, the Inspector-General of the Kenya Police should not have the right to make anytransfers without the consent of the Regional Commissioner concerned.It is clearly necessary that the Inspector-General should be able withouthindrance to draw freely upon the Regional contingents, in order to securesufficient and suitable personnel to man the all-important mobile reserve of General Service Units and the specialised branches, for which he is directly responsible. I consider it, therefore, essential that he should beempowered to post all ranks of the Police Force into or from any Regionalcontingent.15. Thirdly, there is the question of the Inspector-General&apos;s rights tomove police reinforcements from one part of Kenya to another. the framework provided that, before doing so, he must obtain the consentof the Law and Order Committee of the Region concerned, or failing that,he must within 48 hours secure the approval of the National security council; otherwise, the reinforcements must be withdrawn. Recent ex-perience has shown that these restrictions on the movement of police are quite incompatible with the efficient maintenance of law and order, andthere is a clear case for their abolition.16. There is another important amendment in the security organisa-tion which I consider should be made. The Framework provided thatthe independent Police Service Commission should be responsible for the recruitment, promotion and discipline of officers of the Gazetted ranksthroughout Kenya. From the inquiries I have made, I am satisfied that,in order to make proper use of the limited officer material available, theCommission^ sphere of responsibility should be extended to include the inspector ranks. This would mean that about 1,000 police officers outof a total force of about 10,000 would come within the purview of thePolice Service Commission. The other nine-tenths, up to and includingthe rank of sergeant, would continue, as at present, to be recruited, pro-promoted and disciplined by the Regional Commissioner within the Regionalcontingent.17. In the sphere of the Public Service there are also certain amend-ments which I consider should be made. These do not involve a departure from the terms of the Framework, which reads as follows:  &quot; The constitution would entrench appropriate provisions to ensurethe independence of the Public Service from political control. Suit-able arrangements will have to be worked out to meet the staffingneeds both of the Central Government and the Regional Authorities.&quot;18. The present arrangements were not agreed between the parties and are based on an earlier ruling of my own. They provide for eightPublic Service Commissions (one for the Centre and one for each Region).Each is composed of seven members, four of whom are common to all the commissions and are appointed by a procedure that ensures their in-dependence. These arrangements are undoubtedly most unwieldy. they make it difficult to distribute the talent available to the best advantage and
are likely to discourage new entrants. Moreover, they have been severely criticised by the Civil Service unions.19. For these reasons I am satisfied that there should be a singlePublic Service Commission, composed of seven independent members, all of whom should be appointed in the same manner as the four independent members are at present.20. If Civil Servants are to be easily movable from one employingauthority to another, as was always envisaged, there must be commonqualifications and standards throughout Kenya, particularly in regard topay and conditions of service. These should be prescribed by the national assembly.21. Before making a posting, the Public Service Commission should berequired to consult the Regional authority concerned and should endeavour,as far as practicable, to meet their wishes in regard to any special attributes,such as knowledge of a particular language. The Region should not beentitled to insist on tribal connections as a qualification. However, theCommission should be required, as at present, to endeavour to secure that,so far as is practicable, the staff on the Central Government establishmentshould include a reasonable number of persons from each Region, andthat the staff of a Region should include a substantial proportion of personsdrawn from that Region.22. Finally, I had to consider to what extent the various provisionsof the constitution should be entrenched.23. During the period of internal self-government, the Kenya legisla-ture had no power to amend its constitution. Consequently this issue didnot arise in the Nairobi constitutional talks last spring. On the otherhand, the Framework did deal specifically with this question. It providedthat, except with a 75 per cent vote in the House of Representatives and a90 per cent vote in the Senate, no amendment should be made to the&quot; entrenched rights of individuals, Regions, Tribal Authorities or Districts &quot;,and that all other amendments should require a 75 per cent vote in each house.24. I was satisfied that the high level of entrenchment proposed in the framework, although unusually stiff in comparison with other constitu-tions, should be maintained for the following basic items :  the rights of the individual (including the judiciary and citizenship)  tribal authorities (including the all-important tribal land rights)  districts (including the Senate for which the Districts form the electoral constituencies).25. I felt also that it was right that the structure of the Regions (i.e.the provisions governing Regional boundaries, and the composition of the regional Assemblies) should similarly be included in the highest category of entrenchment. However, I found it hard to convince myself that itwas appropriate to attach the same degree of immutability to the sectionsof the constitution which define in detail the various powers of the regional assemblies.7
26. The formulation of Kenya&apos;s unique constitution, which is neitherfederal nor unitary, has raised problems on which there are no exact pre-cedents or experience to guide us, particularly with regard to the allocation of functions between the Centre and the Regions. It must, moreover,be recognised that the present provisions are the product of inter-partybargaining, rather than of any objective planning. It is, therefore, not surprising that some unworkable features have already revealed them-selves ; and it is certain that, as time goes on, others will emerge. Thereis therefore a strong case for leaving some element of flexibility, so thatcorrections can be made in the light of experience.27. I felt it my duty to consider not merely the formula agreed in 1962,but also the purpose which it was intended to serve, namely to make theconstitution more durable.   If the constitution is so rigid that necessary changes are made virtually impossible, there is the danger that frustrationmay drive people to amend it by unconstitutional means. Once a breachis made in any part of the constitution, the whole of the remainder is liableto crumble. Thus the over-entrenchment of rights which are not funda-mental, could well result in the destruction of the basic liberties which it is our prime aim to protect.28. In view of the significance attached to the Framework, I felt thatit was important to maintain as nearly as possible the procedure it pre-scribed for the amendment of the constitution. I therefore considered itdesirable to retain the percentage of votes laid down in the Framework forCategory I (90 per cent, in the Upper House and 75 per cent, in the lower house) and Category II (75 per cent, in each House). However, in orderto permit somewhat more flexibility, I came to the conclusion that, in category II, the alternative of a two-thirds majority in a nation-widereferendum should be provided.29. Ultimately the strength and durability of any constitution depends upon the respect it enjoys among those who work it, and the con-fidence it inspires among those who look to it for protection. That is why I attach special importance to the letter I have received fromMr. Kenyatta, in which he informs me that the Government of Kenya accepts the amendments which it is proposed to make as a settlement of the issues raised in this Conference, and that it is not their intention to make further amendments to the constitution, except in so far as these are shown to be absoulutely necessary in the light of subsequent experience.30. As further evidence of the Government of Kenya&apos;s desire to allayanxieties, they have, in another letter to me, announced a timetable for the rapid completion of the process of implementing the present constitution.They propose to hand over most of the remaining Regional powers to the regional Authorities on 1st December, and the remainder not later than January, 1964.31. I know that there are some who will consider it wrong of theBritish Government to approve any departure whatsoever from the provi-sions previously agreed. I fully understand their feelings ; and I can assure them that before taking any decision we most earnestly consideredour obligations. As a result we came to the clear conclusion that it was our duty to do what was in the best interests of Kenya in the years ahead.
32. I sincerely believe that the amendments on which we have decidedwill make the constitution not only more workable but also more durable.The willing acceptance of this settlement by the Kenya Government will increase confidence in the country&apos;s political stability and will, more than anything else, contribute to the safety of the minorities, whose interests have been so much in our minds. I am firmly convinced that for kenya and all her peoples the advantages of this settlement will more than justifythe constitutional amendments which have been made to secure it.33. I conclude by confirming that 12th December, 1963, will be the dayof Kenya&apos;s independence.
Annex B19th October, 1963.The Secretary of State for the colonies and Commonwealth Relations,London.Dear Mr. Sandys,Now that we come to the end of the Conference I am glad to be ableto inform you that the Kenya Government accept the amendments whichare now proposed to the Kenya Constitution as a settlement of the issues which have been raised at the Conference. It is not our intention to seek to make further amendments to the constitution except in so far as sub-sequent experience shows these to be absolutely necessary.Yours sincerely,(Signed)  JOMO KENYATTA,Prime Minister.
Annex C19th October, 1963.The Secretary of State for the colonies and Commonwealth Relations,London.Dear Mr. Sandys,As promised, I am writing to let you know my Government^intentions concerning the implementation of the constitution.I wish first to re-affirm our intention to transfer to the Regions withall possible speed the departments and services still remaining to be handed over. In order to effect this the following programme will becarried out:  (a) A committee will be set up immediately under the chairman-ship of an official nominated by the Prime Minister which will include representatives of the Government Departments con-cerned and of each Region. This committee will work out thesizes of the Central Government and Regional establishments and settle outstanding questions regarding the transfer of per-sonnel, records, equipment, and other relevant matters. Thecommittee v/ill complete its work and report its decisions not later than 15th November, 1963.(b) Action will then be taken at once by each of the Ministriesaffected to implement these decisions. It is intended that all thedepartments and services concerned will, with the exception ofEducation, be transferred to the Regional authorities on1st December, 1963, save for those few services which, for adminsitrative reasons (e.g. the time taken to complete the physical transfer of equipment and records and, in some cases,personnel), cannot be fully transferred on that date. The transferof these remaining services will be completed not later than31st December, 1963. All the officers concerned in carrying outRegional functions will come under the control of the regional authorities as soon as the service for which they are responsibleis transferred.(c) The Treasury will arrange for the transfer by 30th November ofthe necessary funds to the Regions to cover the relevant services from 1st December.(d) The appropriate educational services will similarly be trans-ferred to the Regional authorities on 1st January, 1964.(e) In so far as it is necessary in order to implement the transferof responsibilities, staff and funds in accordance with this time-table, the powers provided in Section 11 of the Kenya Order inCouncil 1963 will be employed.Yours sincerely,(Signed)  JOMO KENYATTA,Prime Minister.
