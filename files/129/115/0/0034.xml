The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of the recent increase in communaltension in Cyprus, we had offered our good offices to assist the restoration of law andorder, in conformity with the Treaty of Guarantee. But the Turkish Government,who doubted our resolution in the matter, had threatened to take independentaction unless we intervened more forcibly; and they had made certain military dispositions which suggested that they might intend to invade the Island and to seek to partition it by force. We had therefore proposed to the Government of Cyprusthat the forces of the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey stationed in cyprus and placed under British command should assist it in its efforts to secure therestoration of peace. This offer had been accepted; and, provided that theGovernments of Greece and Turkey were prepared to take part in this tripartiteoperation, there was a reasonable expectation that a critical situation might be averted. If so, it would probably be necessary to arrange for the future of the island to be further considered at a fresh international conference as soon as the presenttension had eased. Meanwhile, it would be desirable to discourage any intervention by the United Nations.The Minister of Defence said that decisions were now required on the followingpoints:(i) Although it was essential that the tripartite force should be under british command, it was equally important that the Greek and Turkish components shouldbe committed to the force before any military action was taken to restore law andorder.(ii) The force was to be constituted from British, Greek and Turkish unitsstationed in Cyprus. The British units, however, would need to be replaced in orderto ensure the security of the Sovereign Base Areas and the airfield at Nicosia.Existing plans for this purpose provided for the transfer to the Island of an armoured car squadron from Libya and a battalion from the Strategic Reserve in the UnitedKingdom. Some elements of these units might need to participate in the action to&quot;be taken by the tripartite force; and it would be administratively convenient in somecases to convey them direct to Nicosia. Nevertheless, in order to allay Turkishsuspicions and to deny the Turkish Government any excuse for independentintervention, the replacement units should initially be moved to a Sovereign BaseArea.(iii) It would be wise to curtail the period of notice for the units which wouldbe involved if further reinforcements.were needed.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals. The following main points were made:(a) Even if the Greek and Turkish Governments proved ready to honour their undertaking to participate in the tripartite force, military action could only stabilise the position; it offered no solution to the longer-term problem of the Constitutionof the Island, which required a fresh political decision.(b) In approaching this decision, we should be careful to avoid alienatingboth the Greek and the Turkish communities and finding ourselves left to dealwith the situation single-handed. We must therefore seek, at the appropriate moment, to institute some new system of international guarantees for the Island,which would involve other countries, as well as ourselves, in ensuring its futurestability and welfare. It would be for subsequent consideration whether we shouldinvoke the good offices of the United Nations or the North Atlantic treaty organisation for this purpose.(c) An early visit to Cyprus by the Commonwealth Secretary might be a useful prelude to the international discussions which would be necessary in due course. We should not embark on these discussions however until law and order had been restored in the Island. Otherwise Archbishop Makarios, whose recentproposals for revision of the Constitution had excited Turkish suspicions andprovoked the present crisis, might be tempted to try to gain his ends by maintaining a state of continuous tension. It might be expedient, in addition, to let the archbishop understand that, if the immediate dispute Was not solved by peaceful means, we might be compelled to endorse a partition of the Island as the only alternative.(d) Meanwhile, the tripartite force should avoid, so far as possible, any actionwhich might alienate communal sympathies in the Island; and the british commander would therefore be instructed to conform to the political guidance ofthe High Commissioner.
(e) We should maintain close contact with the United States Government,who might contribute to the immediate relaxation of tension if they were preparedto threaten to suspend military aid to Greece and Turkey and to institute other forms of economic pressure.The Meeting (1) Took note, with approval, of the action taken to constitute, from British,Greek and Turkish units in Cyprus, a tripartite force under british command, in order to secure the restoration of peace in the Island.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange that (a) the units to be transferred to Cyprus in replacement of the units to be contributed to the tripartite force should initially be moveddirect to the Sovereign Base Areas;(b) the period of notice of the units earmarked for any furtherreinforcement of British forces in Cyprus which might berequired should be appropriately curtailed.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation with the foreign secretary, to give further consideration both to the political actionwhich might be taken, in concert, as necessary, with our allies, in orderto reduce the immediate tension in Cyprus and to the measures whichmight subsequently be adopted in order to promote a political solutionof the problem of the Island&apos;s future Constitution.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th December, 1963.
