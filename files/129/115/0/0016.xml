Printed for the Cabinet. November 1963CP. (63) 16 Copy No.    5119th November, 1963CABINETCHALGROVE AIRFIELDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentChalgrove Airfield is at present owned by the Air Ministry and used under licence by the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company for testing aircraft ejectionequipment which is essential for defence purposes, including the development of theP-1154 and the TSR-2.2, In 1959 a sub-committee of the Home Affairs Committee agreed that the airfield should be sold to the Martin-Baker Company and by the beginning ofthis year the sale was all but completed. The Crichel Down policy requires theGovernment, when agricultural land purchased by or under threat of compulsory powers ceases to be used for defence purposes, to give the former owners theopportunity to buy back their land at the market price. Accordingly, in order toensure that when the Martin-Baker Company ceased to use the airfield for testingejection equipment the former owners would be given the option to repurchasetheir land, the Air Ministry in 1959 obtained certain undertakings from Mr. JamesMartin, who controls the company. These undertakings were not originally asextensive as public undertakings given by Ministers, but Mr. Martin subsequentlysuggested informally (in June 1963), that, in the event of the sale of the airfield tohis company, he would meet the Government on this point by undertaking that (a) the airfield would not be used for industrial purposes or for any purposeother than the testing of ejection equipment; and(b) when the airfield ceased to be used for that purpose, the former owners would be given an opportunity to repurchase their land at the thencurrent market price.Mr. Martin is, however, 75, and it is not impossible that the company may be taken over (especially after Mr. Martin&apos;s death) by some other concern which would notbe bound by this undertaking.3. The question at issue is accordingly whether the proposed sale, which isstrenuously opposed by at least one of the former owners and by certain localresidents, should proceed on the basis of Mr. Martin being willing to confirmformally the undertaking which he gave last June, or whether the airfield shouldbe offered to the company only on terms which ensure that when it ceases to beused for testing ejection equipment the undertaking can be enforced by theGovernment.4. It would not be possible to incorporate fully enforceable covenants in aconveyance of the land for sale. The Cabinet, at their meeting on 18th July(C.C. (63) 47th Conclusions, Minute 9), invited the Minister of Defence, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Air, to offer Mr. Martin a 99-yearlease, subject to conditions restricting the use of the airfield to the testing of ejectionequipment and ensuring that the former owners would be given the option topurchase when its use for this purpose ceased.3503THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
5. The Minister of Defence and the Secretary of State for Air have seen mr. Martin and offered him a 99-year lease. Mr. Martin rejected a lease, and inparticular said that a lease would not enable him to recover the considerablesums which had been spent on the airfield on the strength of the Governmentspromise to sell. A copy of his latest letter to the Minister of Defence, dated5th November, is in Annex 1 to this memorandum.i.j 6. The Ministers concerned have considered the situation further inconsultation with the Law Officers. Most of them think that Mr. Martin couldbe brought to accept a lease designed to give him the rough equivalent of the freehold, both in financial terms and in security of tenure. It is therefore proposedto offer him a 999-year lease with a covenant restricting the use of the airfieldto work on testing ejection equipment and binding the Air Ministry, on thetermination of the lease (whether by notice from the company, or by effluxion oftime, or by forfeiture on breach of any covenant of the lease) to pay the company the market value of the property at that time. This would put the Governmentof the day in a position, when the land ceased to be used for defence purposes,to offer the former owners the option of repurchasing their land, and, if theydid not exercise the option, of selling the airfield on the open market. It is intendedto give Mr. Martin the amount he would have received if all the former ownersbought their land under his personal assurance that they could do so.7. It is clearly not going to be easy to persuade Mr. Martin to accept a leaseeven on these terms, since, as indicated in his letter of 5th November, he regardsthe Government as being under promise to sell him the land. It is proposed thatthe offer should be made in a letter from the Minister of Defence in the terms ofthe draft in Annex 2, followed after a few days by a letter from the treasury solicitor to Mr. Martin&apos;s solicitors covering a draft of the proposed lease. Thereis a risk, however, that Mr. Martin may be provoked by the further offer of something falling short of the fulfilment of the Governments undertaking to sell the airfield into making some public demonstration which could be damaging tothe Governments reputation, or, in the extreme case, into discontinuing his workon ejection equipment which would damage important defence interests. It is relevant that Lady Rothenstein, who is not a former ov/ner, but lives in theneighbourhood of the airfield, supported by at least one former owner, isorganising pressure for the land to be sold back to the former owners now, on theunderstanding that they will lease it back to the Martin-Baker Company, and hasthreatened, if this is refused, to demand a public inquiry. Even, therefore, if mr. Martin will accept a lease on the terms proposed, we may not avoid criticism,though we shall be in a position to say that the Government have taken steps toensure that if and when a situation in which they are pledged (because of what hasbeen said in public about Chalgrove) to offer land back to the former ownersarises, the Government of the day will be able to fulfil that pledge.8. Some of my colleagues take the view that the Government should proceedwith the sale, on the basis of formal confirmation of the undertaking which mr. Martin gave in June. They recognise that the undertaking could not be effectively enforced in law, but they regard the Governments faith as pledged toMr. Martin. In their view any other course is likely to cause serious embarrassment to the Government and could jeopardise defence interests.9. I invite the Cabinet to decide whether a further attempt should be madeto persuade Mr. Martin to accept a lease, and, if so, whether the offer should beput to him in the terms of the draft letter in Annex 2.H. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,19th November, 1963.
Annex I5th November, 1963.Dear Mr. Thorneycroft,With further reference to the visit to your office of Mr. D. Burrell and myself on 12th September re the purchase of Chalgrove Airfield, you will nodoubt remember that the interview was most unsatisfactory from the point ofview of this Company. No assurance was given that the aerodrome would everbe sold to us, and such a state of affairs is intolerable as we have spent very large sums of money on Chalgrove on the strength of the promise that it would be sold to us.You did point out that the future of Mr. Fraser could be jeopardised in someway if the aerodrome was sold, although I am at a complete loss to know why this should be. My final words to you on the occasion of our last meeting were that I would not have the subject of Chalgrove debated in Parliament. The solepurpose of my making this remark was that I felt that Mr. Macmillan&apos;sGovernment had reached the limit of discredit due to the Profumo affair.Now a new Prime Minister has been appointed and the situation is changed.I must now ask you a direct question. Will Chalgrove Airfield be sold to this company, and at what date will the sale be completed? If Chalgrove Airfieldis not to be sold to this Company then questions will have to be asked in theHouse. Before this is done, in fairness to the new Prime Minister, Sir Alec Home,he should be made fully acquainted with all the details of the case. I cannotimagine that he will be part or parcel to such a deception as has been practisedover the past few years with regard to the sale of Chalgrove Airfield.As I have pointed out in my previous letters to you, this was no fault of yours,and I have been shaken that any responsible Government should behave in sucha way. Expediency seems to be all that matters, and I sincerely hope that thenew Prime Minister will not allow his Cabinet Ministers to be influenced byinfluential friends as indeed has happened in this case namely Lady Rothenstein.Perhaps you will let me know at the earliest possible date what theGovernment is going to do, as if it is in the negative I will have to see the PrimeMinister myself and give him the full details from the beginning up to date.We have to continue to spend a lot of money on the aerodrome in order tocontinue our development work on ejection seats, and heating for the hangar hasnow become a necessity due to the amount of electronics fitted to the aircraft which can be damaged by damp weather. We also wish to put up an inclinedrocket track so that the seats for the TSR-2 aircraft can be tested in the divingcondition. There is no such device like this in the world.In closing I would say that it is useless to continue further correspondenceother than whether the airfield is to be sold to us or not.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      JAMES MARTIN.
Annex draft LETTER TO Mr. JAMES MARTINAs promised in my letter of 11th November, I have now consulted the PrimeMinister about Chalgrove.We want and intend to safeguard the position of your Company at Chalgrove;at the same time we feel that we must be able to show that what is agreed betweenyou and us is consistent with the undertaking, for which we cannot divest ourselvesof responsibility, that the former owners should, when the time comes, have thefirst opportunity of buying their land back at the then current market value.Neither the Prime Minister nor I question for a moment your absolute good faith and intention to stand by what you have said to Ministers. But we feel thatthe Government owes a duty to the former owners to see that these assurances canbe put into a form which is and can be seen to be legally effective.There are two essential undertakings which we feel must be made binding in circumstances which might be beyond your control:(a) No factory is to be built at Chalgrove and the airfield is to be used only for its present purpose, that is to say, for testing ejection equipment.(This is not what was said in the Air Ministry letter of 24th July, 1959,but has, I believe, been agreed between Mr. Julian Ridsdale andyourself on 16th June of this year.)(b) When the airfield is no longer needed for testing ejection equipment, theformer owners are to have the first opportunity of buying back their land at the market value then current. (Amplifying paragraph 5 of theletter of 24th July, 1959,1 should explain that &quot; current market value &quot;is intended to mean that the Company is to receive not simplyagricultural value, but what could be obtained for the property on themarket, bearing in mind the planning potentialities and any other relevant factors at the time.)Careful consideration has been given to the method by which these two pointscan be assured, whatever may happen, while preserving the financial position and interests of your Company. We believe, on advice, that there is no means whereby,on the basis of sale, your undertakings can be made completely and permanentlyand legally binding on successors and assigns and future shareholders of yourCompany. This being so, I have been thinking again of the discussion we had ona lease, and I believe that we can meet the financial objection which you voiced tome in such a way that you and your Company would be no worse off on a leasethan on a sale. Our proposal is that a lease should be agreed which would be for999 years and would contain the important new provision that, on termination ofthe lease for any reason, the Company would receive a lump sum payment equal tothe full market value of the property at that time, on the basis set out above, thefigure to be agreed or subject to arbitration if necessary. On this basis the leasewould provide that, following an initially agreed payment (equivalent to the sumnegotiated for sale in 1960), the rent would be nominal  1 a year. The lease wouldhave a user covenant, and, while the Company could terminate it on six months&apos;notice at any time, the Air Ministry would be able to terminate it only if the use for testing ejection equipment were to change, or, as is usual, on forfeiture for breach of the covenants.What I am putting to you in this letter is, of course, only an outline. Mattersof this kind need to be set out fully and precisely, and the Treasury Solicitor willbe instructed to put the terms of a draft lease to your solicitors.This has been a most difficult problem, and I am not asking you to accept responsibility for it. My colleagues and I have considered it with very great care,and I really believe that the proposal I have outlined in this letter is one which isfair to both sides and secures your interests. Of course, if you can think of anyway in which the undertakings I have referred to can be made binding andenforceable in all circumstances in the future as part of a sale, I shall be delightedto consider your proposals. We do not wish to do anything in this matter thatprovides less than justice to you, or fails to recognise the full value to the country of your Company&apos;s outstanding achievements.
