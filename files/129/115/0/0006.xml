Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1963CP. (63) 6 Copy No.   514th November, 1963CABINETSOUTH AFRICA: UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL debate on APARTHEIDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs as promised this morning (CM. (63) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 1) I am circulatingthis note on the situation which is developing in the United Nations over Apartheid.The Secretary-General of the United Nations has reported to the Security Councilon the implementation of the Councils resolution of last August calling for a totalembargo on arms for South Africa. It is likely that there will be a meeting of theSecurity Council next week to discuss this and that there will be pressure for measures to secure the compliance of the Government of South Africa with united nations resolutions. The Afro-Asian countries will probably propose a resolution calling for various forms of sanctions.2. Although the United States are opposed to sanctions, we know that theywould not be prepared to veto any resolution on Apartheid. In these circumstances,a resolution calling for some form of selective sanction, e.g., an embargo on oil and strategic materials, would almost certainly receive the necessary seven affirmativevotes to carry, in the absence of a veto either by ourselves or by the French. Thelatter would probably abstain.3. This meeting may well therefore face us with the choice of using ourveto to defeat such a resolution, or of abstaining and thus permitting its adoption,with the embarrassment which that would cause us. To disregard a resolution inmandatory terms, as distinct from a recommendation, would involve us in a breach of our legal obligations under the Charter. Even if we vetoed, the oil companiesmight find themselves under strong pressure from oil-producing countries to cutoff supplies to South Africa. Most of South Africa&apos;s oil imports come from theMiddle East, in particular Iran. It is doubtful whether the Iranian Governmentwould go so far as to try to coerce the oil consortium, but in any event there wouldbe strong pressure on us to comply with the resolution, even if expressed in non-mandatory terms.4. In this situation the United Kingdom permanent representative at theUnited Nations, Sir Patrick Dean, has been authorised to discuss with the UnitedStates and other friendly delegations the possibility of promoting some moderateresolution which would attract support and thus rally the necessary five abstentionsto defeat an extreme one. This might be based on some proposals recently putforward by the Scandinavians. These are attached as an Annex to the paper.5. Sir Patrick Dean has suggested that these proposals might be modified so as to provide that no attempt shall be made to apply coercive measures until there has been agreement on a plan which could be offered as an alternative toApartheid. He has been instructed not to go so far as this since we do not want toencourage the United States and others to commit themselves to the principle ofcoercion, even in the long term. There is however a distinct danger that the UnitedStates, for internal as well as external political reasons, may be dragged intosanctions in due course, particularly after the International Court has given aruling on the question of South-West Africa, which it is likely to do in the first half of next year. A moderate resolution would help to buy time and in due course it might be possible to promote a dialogue between the South Africans and the black Africans.3409THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
6. For these reasons there would be advantage in encouraging our friendsto work for the most constructive part of the Scandinavian proposals, namely theidea of a Planning Group of experts to work out alternative solutions, but withoutlinking this idea with that of coercion. To persuade them of this, it may well benecessary to indicate that we should be prepared to vote for a resolution in theSecurity Council on these lines. There is clearly some risk that this might be held to Create a precedent for Southern Rhodesia or for Angola. It would however beopen to us to argue that, as we have already said, Apartheid is not only sui generisbut also has international repercussions. The same does not in our view apply to southern Rhodesia. We should have to stand firmly on this position, and do everything we can to ensure that Southern Rhodesia is not treated in the united nations on the same footing as South Africa. We can say with truth that Apartheidis not the policy of the Southern Rhodesian or of the Portuguese Government.If necessary we can continue to use the veto on Southern Rhodesia which we can do without serious damage to our position at New York.7. Sir Patrick Dean has been authorised to discuss the matter on theselines in New York and to support a moderate resolution excluding the idea ofcoercion. It should not in my view be necessary at this stage to commit ourselves to participating in the actual working out of political solutions.8. This line will not deter the Afro-Asians from promoting an extremeresolution. But the prospect of securing our vote might rally enough abstentionsby moderates in the Security Council to defeat an Afro-Asian draft.9. It may be that the United States and the Scandinavians will be unwilling to drop all mention of coercion as a means of persuading the South african government to abandon its present policies. In that case it might be possible to draft a formula which would not embarrass us too much. Such a formula might,for example, say that there should be no further consideration of coercive measuresuntil there has been agreement on a plan which could be offered as an alternative to Apartheid. I would suggest that we could if necessary go so far as to suppor tsuch a draft.10. There is the further possibility that the United States and Norway might go so far as to vote for the principle of coercion in some form, whether by partialsanctions such as a ban on the export of strategic materials to South Africa, orby the establishment of a Committee to consider measures to influence the attitudeof the South African Government. It was suggested in the Cabinet this morningthat in that sort of eventuality we should endeavour not to be put in the positionof being obliged to exercise our veto but should be able to abstain. Sir PatrickDean has this point very much in mind. In view of our obligations under the charter it would be very important to ensure that a resolution of this kind wasdrafted in non-mandatory terms and we should have to look to the United Statesand Norway to ensure this, as they did in the case of the Security Council resolution of last August calling for a total arms embargo. If the United States and Norwayvoted in favour, we should find ourselves, as we did last August, alone with theFrench in abstaining.11. We have heard from Sir Patrick Dean that he has already had some preliminary discussions with the United States and Norway. The prospects for a moderate resolution which we might be able to support do not seem to be altogetherunfavourable at present but we expect to learn more about the United States attitude in a day or two when the permanent United States representative at the united nations, Mr. Stevenson, returns from a visit to Washington.R. A. B.Foreign Office, S.W.J.31st October, 1963.
annex the following represents the line of thought of Denmark on the question ofApartheid, and the action that ought to be taken by the General Assembly. this line of thought is supported by the other Nordic countries:(1) The General Assembly should strongly urge the Security Council on receiptof the Secretary-General&apos;s report to consider steps suitable to influence the attitude of the South African Government, and able to commandsuch support from Member States as would render them effective,and expresses confidence that Member States would implementrecommendations by the Security Council in this regard.(2) The Assembly should at the same time in a solemn declaration expressits desire to see established in South Africa after abolition of Apartheida truly democratic, multi-racial society with equal rights for allindividuals. It should call upon all groups and individuals in SouthAfrica to have confidence in their own future in such a society.(3) The Assembly should further state the readiness of the United nations to lend, if necessary, its assistance during a transitional period in themaintenance of law and order and the protection of life and civil rightsof all individuals and in the shaping of the new society.(4) Finally, the Secretary-General should be requested to establish a planninggroup of experts with the object of studying the alternative possibilitiesand phases of development in South Africa and of planning the part tobe played by the United Nations in them. It should report to theSecretary-General who will make progress reports available to member governments.
