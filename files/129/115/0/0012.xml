A draft of this statement is at Annex I.3.       I was asked to consider how to meet any allegations of inconsistency or lack of co-ordination between the Buchananapproach and that of the Government over the Beeching plan for therailways.   I will deal with this point orally.4.       The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes to raise theprocedure for handling the major issues of policy which will faceus on publication.

DRAFT STATEMENT TO BE MADSBY THE MM3TSR CF TRANSPORT&quot; IN THE HtjjggOF I commons on&quot;2 7TirNOVEMBERri963Professor Buchanan^s eagerly awaited report on the long-term problem of traffic in towns and a covering report by the steering groupunder Sir Geoffrey Crowther are being made available to Hon.members this afternoon.   They will be on sale to the public tomorrow.2.      Both reports are original and stimulating.   The Government isgrateful to the authors.   Their reports look ahead to the time whenvirtually every family owns a car, and they try to show what this level of car ov/nership will mean in our towns and cities.   Theyexamine ways of reshaping towns during the nesct 50 years so as to combine the convenience of the motor car with civilised urban living.3.      For a lot of people the motor car is of great value for gettingto work and for recreation.   But in our cities and towns it has alsostarted to choke movement and indeed to threaten the balance of lifethere.   To meet this threat Professor Buchanan offers two mainideas for replanning towns in the motor age.   First, the main trafficmovements should be canalised into a :&apos;primary road network&quot;.   Heretraffic takes precedence.   Second, the rest of the town which is served by this primary network should be planned in terms of&quot;environmental areas&quot;.   Here reasonable living conditions comefirst.   This approach demands that planning of traffic and planning of land use must be done together; the two must serve a singlepurpose.4.      In the smaller towns Professor Buchanan indicates thatredevelopment on such lines would make it possible - at a cost - toprovide for the use of private ca.rs to whatever extent their ownersare likely to want.   But in the larger towns he demonstrates thatthis is just not physically possible if we are to have tolerable living conditions.This applies however heroic the scale on which we replan orredevelop. Pie stresses that modern and attractive public transport will have an ever more important role to play.5.       The Government accept Professor Buchanan&apos;s basicapproach that a balance will have to be struck between the growingneeds of traffic and the other needs of urban life.   This is already being recognised in the plans for the more recent new towns andsome major urban developments.o.      Every big town will sooner or later have to face the problemsof the motor age.   Already local authorities are starting to do so and they will have to do so increasingly.7.       This requires, especially in the conurbations, a system oflocal government able to deal effectively with the problems of traffic and planning.   The current reorganisation will produce a simplifiedstructure and should result in a system much better able to dealwith these formidable problems.-1-
8.       It also calls for increased resources.   Already the road programme provides for greater spending on urban roads   - rising from  50 million a year now to  140 million by 1970.9.       It will be for each town to decide what provision it wishes tomake for traffic and the quality of environment it wishes to sustain.To help in this my Rt. Hon. Friends the Secretary of State forScotland, the Minister of Housing and Local Government and I havealready created a joint urban planning group.   We are also consider-ing other ways of strengthening our organisation,10.      To tackle the problems in the main conurbations the firstneed is to undertake a comprehensive transport survey to forecast the future demands for transport, its relation to future land use, andthe right balance between the different forms of transport.   Such a survey in London is well under way.   Another is being prepared forGlasgow.   And Tyneside, Teeside and Manchester will fellowquickly.11.      These surveys are bound to bring out the importance of public transport in offering a real and acceptable alternative to the privatecar, particularly for travel to and from work in our city centres.   Inthe very short-term we have no option but to make the fullest andbest possible use of our existing streets.   This means comprehensive and skilful traffic management.   And also the parking problem mustbe tackled positively and effectively - both on and off the streets.12.     In the longer-term, as Sir Geoffrey Crowther&apos;s report makesso clear, the Government, local government and many ethers willhave to tackle problems of organisation, resources, techniques and finance on a scale they have never known before in this field.   these problems cannot be resolved quickly.   As Professor Buchanan says,there is no simple ^solution&apos;&apos; to the traffic problem.   To quote:&quot;it is not so much a problem as a social situation which can only bedealt with by policies patiently applied over .a period, and revisedfrom time to time in the light of events1&apos;.   In finding the rightanswers the Government rmist and will play a large part.   But thepeople of each town and their local authority will have to decide for themselves the balance they want.
ANNEX IILONG-TERM PROBLEMS OP TRAFFIC IN TOWNSTH.I BUCHANiiN AMD CROVirTBER REPORTS1 .     The Buchanan Report is a warning, in graphic terms, cfthe disastrous effects which traffic will have on our townsover the next forty years, unless wo can contrive to controland canalise it.     The purpose of the Report is to discusshow best to reconcile the movement of traffic with the main-tenance of tolerable living conditions.     The Crowther Reportendorses the technical findings of Buchanan, but sharpens the issues by making highly controversial comments about the implications for public policy,2.     The two reports, and particularly Crowther&apos;s, are likely to stimulate lively public discussion and will spark off demands for dramatic action by the Government.     They will be seen asportraying a situation of imminent crisis in the larger towns.They raise fundamental questions about the pattern, pace and scale of urban redevelopment, including urban roads;    and aboutthe organisation needed to do the job.3.      An interdepartmental committee cf officials hasalready examined the two reports.     In this.note we^set-out first the nature &quot;of the problem;     second, a synopsisof Buchanan&apos;s approach to it;     and third, those issues which require the attention of Ministers at this stage andour recommendations for handling these issues.The nature of the problemhe     The number of vehicles of all types in Great Britainincreased from four million in 1950 to ten million in 1962,and is likely to increase.to eighteen million in 1970 and-1-
twenty-seven million in 1980.      By the year 2010 it is expectedthat the total number of cars will be over four times what itwas in 1-96.2.      But the highest rate of increase is in theimmediate future.     Car ownership will double by 1970 andtreble by 1980 - there will then he an average of one carper family,Buclianan &apos;s appreach5,      In brief, the Buchanan thesis is as follows.    There is amaximum amount of traffic which any town can accommodate.The actual amount is governed by the physical limitations cfroad, capacity, by the expense cf enlarging that capacity, bythe resources available to meet that expenditure and by theimportance attached to other urban values besides freedom oftraffic movement.,      The problem of balancing these conflictinginterests is essentially a local one.      The crux of theBuchanan approach is that the main traffic flows should &quot;becanalised en to a &quot;primary road network&quot; on which the needs oftraffic have priority;  and that the rest cf the town should bereshaped into a series cf &quot;environmental areas11 in which trafficXTis subordinate to the interests cf these living and working there6.      Buchanan sho-,/s that problems of accessibility increase with town size and density;    the difficulties increase towardstown centres.    fie considers that it should be possible tcprovide, in time end at a cost, for full accessibility in townsup to a population of about 100,000;    in towns of over 100,000/population there will have to be some limitation on the use ofprivate cars for travel tc and from crowded centres, and public transport will have to be maintained and improved.7.      Buchanan stresses that there is no one remedy whifch can beapplied throughout the country;    it is for each town to make itschoice cf the level of traffic it wishes to sustain and thequality of environment which it wishes tc- create.    Transportsurveys should be used as an aid to this choice.    The trafficproblem, he concludes - &quot;is net so much a problem as a socialsituation which can only bo dealt with by policies patientlyapplied over a period,  and revised from time to time in thelight of events.    There is no straightforward or  &quot;best&apos; solution&apos;&apos;-2-CONFSDENTIAL
0 wTHE MAJOR ISSUESThe general approach8.     Buchanan&apos;s general assessment of the scale of theproblem is incontrovertible.     His planning approach to it is sound, and we recommend that this and his underlying principleof maintaining the compactness of our towns as opposed toindiscriminate sprawl on the American pattern should be endorsed.9.     The reconstruction of our cities will take a very longtime and is unlikely to be completed throughout the country before the end of the century.     In the meantime, we are facedwith the certainty that the pressure of traffic in towns willat least double by 1980.     Progress with physical reconstruc-tion must be pressed forward, but in the next ten to twenty years a great many other measures will be at least as urgent.Investment10,   The road programme which has been fixed for the fiveyears up to 1968-69 already  allows    for raising j&amp;exchequer andlocal authority expenditure on urban.roads to about  1U0million a year .in the  early 1 970s - nearly treble the. present level.     The Government will undoubtedly be pressed to increase thibut it is as much as we can hope to -manage in the time.     Itwill enable a useful start to be made on constructing the primary road networks, though it will not keep pace with the increasing traffic.11.   The Government will also be pressed to accept commit-ments which would send expenditure to even higher levelsafter 1970.     We think it is too soon for Ministers to enterdefinite commitments so far ahead.     Any such commitmentswould present great problems of priority, both as betweenurban and inter-urban roads and as between roads and other programmes which make claims on investment resources.     Butthe implications of Buchanan should be specially considered at the next annual review of the road programme and ofpublic investment.-3-
12*   The Buchanan proposals require substantial urbanredevelopment as well as road building.     Much of this willtake place in any event, but the construction of primary roadnetworks will change the priorities and might provide theopportunity for very extensive redevelopment if the resources are available for it.   We shall have to take account of boththe road works and of consequential redevelopment in considering the total resources required..13o   A large proportion of the redevelopment will be housing.Provision for an increasing rate of house-building is already made in investment programmes, but this is primarily for slum clearance and other immediate needs which must at present andfor some years to come take priority over redevelopment in- thepublic housing sector^ though slum clearance and re-development for other   purposes may sometimes coincide*     There is also likely to be much commercial redevelopment.       The total re-develcpment involved in providing for traffic will, over theforty-year period, be very large.     But its timing cannot beforecast (the building of a ring motorway, for instance, doesnot itself mean that the whole of the property inside the ringhas to be redeveloped at one go), nor can its distributionbetween the public and the private sectors.     In the circumstances we cannot yet make any reasonable estimate of what it will amountto.11)..   Difficulties caused by traffic increase disproportionatelywith the size of the urban area concerned.     We recommend that,both in construction and in other measures, attention should befocused on the seven conurbations,* and, to a lesser degree, onthe largest towns outside the conurbations.     Smaller towns, andparticularly those of less than 100,000 population, must wait,though there will be need for more by-passes to ensure thatcongestion in small towns does not block the flow of inter-urban traffic.    Any new towns or m&amp;ior expansions of existingLondon, Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, Merseyside,West Yorkshire, Tyneside.-4-
towns being planned now or to be planned in the future should be designed to take full account of the growth of cor traffic, andof the Buchanan thesis of a primary road net-work and environmental areas in which living conditions take priority.     Weunderstand that this is already being done.Transport surveys15.   The first need for each major urban area is to secure, by meansof a transport survey, an adequate picture of the future demands for transport and its appropriate distribution between public and private,and, between road and rail.     Such surveys take about two years andwould be a new venture for most local authorities;    a strong leadfrom the centre will be essential.     They are already under way inLondon and Tyneside, one is being prepared for Glasgow and one isproposed for Teeside.     We recommend that the Ministry of transport should get surveys started in other conurbations.     Similar surveyswill also be needed in other large towns, but the scarcity of technicalskills will be a problem;    consultants are available, but becausethe experts are scarce it may be necessary to spread their service as widely as possible by posting between authorities.Restriction on traffic.16.   Both reports are clear that there will have to be limitations on the use of private cars in the large urban centres, even whenreconstruction is complete, and still more before that.     We see no escape from this conclusion, and public opinion must be educatedby every possible means to accept it.      Possible methods of limitationare being studied by the Ministry of Transport and recommendations will be put to Ministers shortly.17c   In the meantime, as experience in London has shown, parkingpolicy and traffic management are vital.      Outside London these arethe responsibility of the local authorities.    It will be necessaryto ensure that they are used effectively.     Advice already in preparation will be issued as soon as possible.
Public&apos; Transport18.   Buchanan makes clear that the maintenance and improvementof public transport will be essential,  since it will beimpossible fully to accommodate private car traffic in largotowns, particularly for commuters.      The immediate task isto halt and reverse the decline of public transport whilelong-term plans arc being worked out on the basis of transportsurveys.     This has implications for some of the railwayclosures proposed by the British Railway Board, and now being examined by Departments.     Decisions about seme suburbanclosures may have to be deferred until transport surveys havebeen c omp1c t ed.19.    The Ministry of Transport are also studying a series of measures designed to make public transport - in towns more attractive.     This work should be accelerated.Research20.   Buchanan lists a number of subjects on which research is needed.      Questions of research priorities and the agenciesresponsible for carrying it out will be considered by theDepartments concerned to ensure that this research effort is not diffusedand has a strongly practical bias, and that the results aremade widely available to the local authorities.Local and central government organisations(i)   Local21 ,    The Crowther report is highly critical of the government machinery, both central and local, for carrying throughredevelopment.      It recommends the establishment ofGovernment appointed and financed regional developmentagencies for each &quot;urban region&quot;  (i.e. each conurbation orfree-standing city, with its surrounding catchment area)-o-
to oversee the whole programme of urban modernisation in itsregion, getting the local authorities to do as much as theywill, and, failing them, carrying through the business of modernisation themselves.       All Government grants for development purposes would be channelled to local authoritiesthrough these agencies,22,    It is true that the local government machinery, especiallyin the conurbations,  is at present not well adapted fortackling the job of urban redevelopment on the scale now seen to be necessary.     But the job is essentially &quot;one for localgovernment-    though local authorities will certainly need helpin grappling with it.      Meanwhile, local government is beingreorganised   (this is not referred to by Crowther) with a viewto reducing drastically the number- of authorities, and producing a simplified structure better able to deal with the major planning and traffic problems especially in the conurbations.     The Greater London Council will have these responsibilities for the whole built up area of London;    inthe Black Country eighteen local author j.ties of different typesare to be reduced to five county boroughs, and it should be possible to get that number of authorities to work, in concert(with their neighbours) on their traffic problems-    onTyneside the Local Government Commission have proposed theestablishment of a county council to be responsible,  inter alia, for planning and traffic over the whole of theconurbation&quot;    and the current Scottish proposals would reducethe number of major planning authorities involved in the glasgow conurbation from fifteen to four.-7-
23.    The reorganisation will not produce single authoritiesover such urban &quot;regionsas Crowther envisages.Localgovernment organisation has necessarily to strike a compromise between the needs of the different services, and areas bigenough to embrace the catchment areas with the towns would be too big for other purposes.      But reorganisation will, ifvigorously pursued, result in a much more effective organisation for carrying through urban redevelopment by elected localauthorities.      It seems to us wholly unacceptable, at thevery moment when this is being pursued, to introduce Governmentagencies to sit over the local authorities on what will be increasingly one of their major functions.      To do so would seriously weaken local initiative.     The local authorities will,as noted above, need help, but this can and should, be providedby the Departments&apos;    and it will be for them to see that thelocal authorities work together in carrying out transportsurveys and in planning the new road net-works.2h.    The reports do however underline the importance of drivingforward the reorganisation, and of achieving the greatest possible simplification of the local government structure,(ii) Central25.   The  criticism of central government is presumablydirected-at thv f Ct that land planning and traffic arc,in England and Wales, handled by different Departments.   - The-Ministry of Housing and&quot;Local Government are however already working very closely with the Ministry of Transport, and this -has been recognised by the creation of:a&apos; joint urban planning&apos;group,&quot;&apos;&quot; staffed by-those Departments and the Scottish DevoloumeiTtDepartment, wtubh Will advise the l-cal authorities on the handling of traffic and re-development problems.     v/e think&apos; thatthis is the right arrangement and that&apos; it is working satisfactorily.-8-
ohGrants26o     Both Crowther and Buchanan commented adversely on thepresent system of grants to local authorities for highwaysand redevelopment0     It is accepted that the system requires a thorough overhaul, and that as they impinge on urbanredevelopment   the grants must be integrated,,     This is nowbeing examined by the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Scottish Development Department with theMinistry of Transport, and the proposals to emerge will beincluded in the general review of the relations between central and local government finance which Ministers havealready decided should be undertaken,,Sjarmnary;27o     We conclude that -(l) Ministers should endorse Buchanan&apos;s planningapproach to the problem (paragraph 8),(2) Authorised expenditure on urban roads is alreadyrising fast and, in view of other potentialclaims on investment resources, Ministers shouldnot at this stage make commitments to raiseexpenditure on urban roads above the level thatwill be reached by 1970 (paragraph 11).(3) The implications of Buchanan should, however, be specially considered at the next annual review ofthe road programme and of public investment(paragraph 11).(4) The problem will be most critical in the conurbations and the largest towns,  and these should be tackled first;    the rest, and particu-larly those of less than 100,000 population,must wait, though more by-passes to aid inter-urban traffic will be needed (paragraph 14)... -9- &apos;.........       I
(5) The Ministry of Transport should, initiate transportsurveys in the conurbations where these have notyet been started (paragraph 15).(6) Ultimately some permanent restriction on traffic in large urban centres will be inescapable andpublic opinion will have to be educated to acceptit0     In the meantime full use should be made ofparking policy and traffic management:    earlyadvice should be issued on these([paragraphs 16 and 17) 9(7) Decisions about some suburban rail closures mayhave to be deferred until transport surveys havebeen completed (paragraph 18).(8) Studies of traffic control and other measureslikely to be helpful to public transport in urban areas should be accelerated (paragraph 19).(9) Priorities in, and agencies for, research will besettled by the Departments concerned (paragraph. 20) 9(10) Crowther&apos;s proposal for ad,Jape, bodies to overseeurban modernisation is not acceptable.     This is essentially a job for local government, now beingreorganised;    this reorganisation shoiild be drivenforward, with the object of achieving the greatestpracticable simplification (paragraphs 21-2h),(11) The question of grants to local authorities forhighways and redevelopment is being considered bythe Departments concerned and should then beincluded in the general review of central/localfinancial relations (paragraph 26).
