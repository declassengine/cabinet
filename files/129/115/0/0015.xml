Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1963Copy No.   5 1CABINETINCREASED ALLOWANCES FOR THE CHILDREN OF WIDOWSMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceAt the Meeting of the Cabinet on 14th November (CM. (63) 5th conclusions minute 4), I was asked to circulate a memorandum on the feasibility of assistingwidowed mothers by increasing the amount of the children&apos;s allowance.2. This would need a Bill, of two or three Clauses and perhaps a shortSchedule, to amend a number of items in the Second Schedule of the 1946 Act andthe corresponding provisions of the Industrial Injuries Act.3. The first problem would be to limit the scope of the Bill. It would be most unlikely that amendments of the rates payable for children generally couldbe ruled out of order, and it is possible that wider amendments would be accepted,even to abolish the earnings rule for widowed mothers.4.  The justification of such a Bill would be difficult:(i) It is only six months since these allowances were increased. 5s. a week was then added for each widow&apos;s child, compared with 2s. 6d. foreach child of other national insurance beneficiaries. This was part ofa general uprating exercise. Now to increase the allowances forwidowed mothers only, without strong reasons, would cast doubt onthe adequacy of last May&apos;s general increase in benefit rates.(ii) Widowed mothers already get far more for their children than other national insurance beneficiaries including family allowances, 30s. asagainst 20s. for the first two children, and 32s. as against 22s. for other children. The further this preference is extended, the stronger the pressure to improve the rates for the children of other beneficiaries,especially those who have been ill for a long time. If the rate forwidowed mothers&apos; children is again increased, it will be getting near41s. 6d. a week, which is the amount payable for wives.5. Without a simultaneous increase in the national assistance scale rates for children (which would be difficult to confine to widows&apos; children) the 16,000widowed mothers who receive national assistance to supplement their insurance benefit would have their national insurance increase offset by a reduction in their national assistance. There would in that case be no net benefit to the poorest ofthe widowed mothers.6. There are about 180,000 children of national insurance and industrial injuries widows at any one time. An increase of 2s. 6d. a v/eek in their allowance would cost the Insurance Funds about  1-2 million a year. Consequential changesin war pensions would cost the Exchequer about  150,000. These figures take no account of the consequences for national assistance.CP. (63) 1519th November, 19633502THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
2CONFIDENTIAL7. My main doubt is whether increases in the children&apos;s allowances would do much to relieve present pressures. These take two forms:(i) Criticism of the allowances, not because they are too small, but becausethey end at the age of 18. The likely effect of an increase in their sizewould be to strengthen the demand for their extension beyond 18.(ii) The desire to abolish the earnings rule for widowed mothers. ThoseI widows who would be 41s. 6d. a week better off if the rule were abolished are unlikely to be appeased by small increases for their children.8. If a Private Member&apos;s Bill were introduced to abolish the rule, we mightclaim that our own measure gave help where need was greater. But we should certainly be pressed to abolish the rule as well, and I am very doubtful whethera Bill to increase the allowances for children would make victory against theabolitionists certain.R. W.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C. 2,18th November, 1963.
