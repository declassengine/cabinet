confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1963CP. (63) 4 Copy No.   g \29th October, 1963 &apos; -CABINETFOREIGN OFFICE ACCOMMODATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Public Building and works at their meeting on 11th July, 1963 (C.C. (63) 45th Conclusions), the cabinet agreed that a new building should be constructed for the Foreign Office and theCommonwealth Relations Office and invited me to consider, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, whether the design of the new building should bethe subject of competition, and to circulate proposals.2. I have discussed this matter informally with the President of the RoyalInstitute of British Architects, Sir Robert Matthew. His view is that if the architectis to be selected by a competition, that competition must be an open one, and thatthe only alternative to this is to appoint an architect. Limited competitions are meeting with severe and growing opposition. I agree with this view.3. Experience shows that under an open competition there is a very strongrisk that the better known architects will not compete. Although the competitionrules might be so drafted that the winning design need not be accepted, it is alwaysdifficult and embarrassing not to commission the winner of an open competition.4. I therefore recommend the appointment of the architect without acompetition. The President of the Royal Institute of British Architects is willingto suggest, say, six architects, including some of the younger, rising members ofthe profession, for consideration. These architects would then be interviewedindividually and their past work examined. I would then make an appointmentafter consultation with those of my colleagues who were principally concerned.5. I ask the Cabinet to agree that the architect for the new Foreign office should be appointed without a competition under the procedure I have outlined.G. R.Ministry of Public Building and Works, S.E. 1,28th October, 1963.3381
