Printed for the Cabinet,  November 1963    \.CP. (63) 9 *  Copy No.&quot; 5111 th November, 1963CABINETHILL COW SUBSIDYMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodMy colleagues asked me to consider whether, instead of withdrawing thissubsidy in 1965 from those farmers who appear to be ineligible as a result of therecent survey, the conditions of entitlement to the subsidy could be redefined, or alternatively payment continued for a longer period (C.C. (63) 56th Conclusions,Item 5).2. To deal first with extended payments. It would not be right, nor would wish to make a case, on agricultural grounds, for payments after 1964 to thosewho have finally to be put out. This is as much as we did in a somewhat similarcase before.3. As to the conditions of entitlement, out of the 1,700 farmers who wouldbe ineligible under the recommendations which have been made to me following the review, there are some 1,100 who stand to be excluded because their land is too good to qualify. Any general relaxation designed to accommodate all these would mean letting in thousands of other farmers who have never drawn thesubsidy and do not expect it or need it. This I would not recommend.4. The burden of the problem arises over the remaining 600 farmers or so who farm in areas that, by the standards of the national review, could no longer be considered in the terms of the present scheme to consist &quot; predominantlyof mountains, hills or heath &quot;. If I accept these standards, then all farms in such areas, including those which are only suitable for livestock rearing, would haveto be excluded out of hand. These are areas which were admitted as eligible by my predecessors through the machinery of decision which they had decided upon.I believe we are under strong obligation to accept the consequences of their policy by keeping these areas in the scheme, for the benefit of land which is only suitablefor livestock rearing, and not &quot; to any material extent for dairying, fattening orcash cropping &quot;.5. I am advised that under the legislation I can, in the new Statutory Scheme,specify the areas I want to benefit by scheduling the appropriate rural districts and parishes. I would then take power to pay subsidy on any land within the scheduled areas on which subsidy is now being paid, and which on inspectionappeared to be substantially suitable only for livestock rearing.6. While this solution would only reprieve a minority of those at risk, itwould ensure that a man whose land is really only fit for livestock rearing and whois at present enjoying the subsidy will not be excluded by a new administrativedecision. Moreover no one on better land would be excluded without individualinspection of his farm and the right of appeal. I believe this is the best solution toa difficult problem. Coupled with the decision to pay subsidy in 1964 even tothose who will eventually lose it, I believe the N.F.U. would find it hard to argue that we had not acted reasonably and fairly.THIS pOGUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT3445
7. If we decide to proceed in this way I would tell the House as soon aspossible. Farmers whose land has already been inspected and found too goodwould then have to be told straightaway that they will not be entitled to subsidyafter 1964 (subject, of course, to appeal). Farmers in the scheduled areas wouldbe inspected as soon as possible and they would mostly know their fate by theend of the year.. ,8. I invite my colleagues to agree that I should proceed accordingly to makeajnew scheme on the lines set out in paragraph 5 above.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W. 1,7th November, 1963.
