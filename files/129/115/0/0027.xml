DOCUMENT To THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY!G GOVERNMENT).  v el&quot;::CP. (63) 27 COPY NO.     - -9th December, 1?63CABINET3MPROVEMENTS IN PROVISION FOR WIDOWED MOTHERS--.......-   AND THEIR CHILDRENMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal i report the views of the Committee on Pensions and national insurance on a combination of measures for the improvement of benefits for widowed mothers and their children.2.       V/e have considered:-(a) An extension of the period over which widowed mothers&apos;personal allowances, children&apos;s allowances and family allowances would remain in payment.   The widowed motherrs personal allowanceat present continues until her last child has attained age 18.   ThechildrenTs allowances and the family allowances continue in paymentuntil the child&apos;s eighteenth birthday but only if the child is in full-time education or is a low paid apprentice.   The proposal is in eachcase that the payment should continue until the child1 s nineteenthbirthday.   This would cost  2 million a year including about  1 million for family allowances, and would rise to  3j million a year.(b) Some increase in the amount of the allowances for children ofwidowed mothers.   An increase of 5s, a week would cost  2-f million for the children of widowed mothers only.   But we think that some increase would be required consequentially in the allowances for children of other beneficiaries under national insurance?  and if this is put at 2s. 6d. a week, it would cost  3jf- million a year.   There wouldalso be consequential charges under the war pensions schemes, but a saving approaching  2 million on national assistance.   So the cost ofthese changes would be  64 million on the National Insurance Fundsbut a saving of about SLlj million to the Exchequer.(c) An alternative to (b) above: At present the children of widowed mothers attract a national insurance allowance and a family allowance.Orphan children in the care of guardians attract no family allowance butthe guardian is paid an allowance which is greater than the total benefitattracted to the child of a widowed mother.   If the allowances to thechildren of widowed mothers were equated with these guardians1allowances, this would increase the payment for the first and secondchildren from 30s. a week in aggregate to 37s. 6d. a week;  and forother children from 32s. a week to the same figure of 37s. 6d. a week.-1-
This would cost  3^- million a year*.(d) At present the limit on the amount which a widowed mother mayearn (net)before deductions are made from her personal allowance is 6 a week.   (The corresponding limits for widows and retirement pensioners are  4 5s.)  If the limit for widowed mothers were raised to  0, the cost would be  -g- million;  if raised to  9,  4 million.(e) If the earnings limits not only for widowed mothers but also for widows and retirement pensioners were increased by, say, 25s. for thewidowed mother and 20s. for the other categories, the cost would beabout  2.2 million.3.       We are agreed that (a) and alternative (c) should be accepted,and (b) and (d) should be rejected.   The special advantage that we see in (c) is that it would concentrate benefit on the widowed mother and provide the best available protection against pressure to extend similar concessions to classes other than widowed mothers.4.       We do not think, however, that (a) and (c) by themselves wouldprovide sufficient answer to the pressure for abolition of the earnings rule for widowed mothers.   Some of us think that the pressure is such that the best course would be to agree to the abolition of this rule (ata cost of about  .1% million a year),   while recognising that before longthis would almost certainly lead to irresistible pressure for theabolition of the earnings rule for widows (which would raise the costto about  7 million a year).   In that event, the earnings rule for retirement pensioners would be at risk, and this would involve over 100 million a year.   I personally think - although I am alone in thisview - that there is much to be said for a relaxation, short ofabolition, of the earnings rule for all the classes, as in (e), since Ibelieve that we should be criticised in the country for making a concessionover the earnings rule to widowed mothers but not to widows.   On theother hand, any of these concessions on the earnings rules benefitsthose who are not the worst off.5. In the fact of these difficulties over the earnings rule, some of us think that the best course would be to combine (a) and (c) with some kind of enquiry into the position of widows and their children;  and theon JLa test information there are now some 19, 000 widowed mothers whose benefit is supplemented by national assistance.   Theincreased payments under (c) would bring some net benefit to about, 000 who would cease to require supplementation.   The financialposition of the remaining 14, 000 could only be improved if there were a simultaneous increase in national assistance scale rates for children.This could not be limited to widows&apos; children and would therefore be extremely expensive.   Further, it would enlarge the area in which the&quot;wage stop&quot; has to be applied.   It must also be very doubtful how farimprovement in the E:.ard&apos;s scale of rates could be limited to those for children.-2-
prevailing view in the Committee is that this course would enable us to resist all the current pressures for improvement of provision forwidowed mothers.   But much depends upon the form of any enquiry thatwe might set up, and on this point we submit alternative suggestions for consideration by the Cabinet:-(1) An enquiry into the condition of widows and their children,to be made by the Social Survey.   This would be purefact finding,(2) A similar enquiry covering the position of widowed mothersand their children as part of a wider enquiry into the positionof married women at work, with special reference to their children.(3) An enquiry by an outside committee with status lower thanthat of a Royal Commission.   This would undertake an enquiry into the general problems of widows and widowhoodand would not be limited in scope to the provision madev/ithin national insurance.A difficulty with (1) and (2) is that the Government would be criticised for not undertaking such a survey earlier, but we might justify ourposition by pointing to the rapid changes in the pattern of employmentof married women in recent years.   Another difficulty with (2) is that;*v. would weaken the impact of the proposed enquiry as a means of meeting pressure for improvement of the position of widowed mothersin particular,;   The difficulty with (3) is that it would appear to shelvethe matter for two or three years.    It would, however, be what theNational Council of Women wanted.6.       We should need legislation for the changes in the period and amount of benefits under (a) and (c).   If the Cabinet were to favourany change in the earnings limits, we would recommend that this shouldnot be included in the Bill because it would be inviting amendments toextend whatever we propose to do;  and we might then find that ourconcessions on (a) and (c) would not help us to raise sufficient support to defeat those amendments.   It would still be open to make the changeby regulation.   But it is true that the regulation   would be opposed bythe National Insurance Advisory Committee to whom they have to besubmitted under the statute.   Their report would have to be laid beforeParliament before we could proceed with the necessarv affirmative resolutions, and we know that they are strongly against any further relaxation of the earnings rules, at any rate without a fresh generalenquiry.
7.To summarise our recommendations:(l)    We should extend the period of payment of the allowances to widowed mothers&apos; families from age18 to age 19 of the child concerned (paragraph 2(a)).(2)   We should align widowed mothers&apos; children&apos;s allowanceswith those for orphaned children in the care of guardians(paragraph 2(c)).(3)   There should be some form of enquiry into the positionof widows and their children, as suggested in paragraph 5.The alternative forms there set out are submitted forconsideration by the Cabinet.(4)   A majority of the Committee felt that (1), (2) and (3)above, provided that the form of the enquiry could be satisfactorily presented, would hold the situation inParliament.(5)   If, however, it should be thought necessary to do somethingabout the earnings rule, that should be done by regulation.Such a decision would involve reconsideration of whether(1) and (2) above were also necessary in that event.Whitehall6th December, 1963(TO W El B&quot;SP NT.IA I
