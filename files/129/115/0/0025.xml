McNAMARABEFORE THE ECONOMIC CLUB OF NEW YORKWALDORFA3TORIA HOTEL, NEW YORK-, NEW YORKMONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1963Before long this Administration will be presenting, once again,the details of a proposed national defense budget for the consideration of theCongress and the public.   Given the importance of these matters, theircomplexities and uncertainties and the existence of real differences of opinion,a degree of controversy is inevitable, and even desirable.Some controversies, however, reveal underlying differences in per-spective that scarcely suggest the participants are living in the same world.Within the past few weeks, some critics have suggested that we have literallyhundreds of times more strength than we need;  others have accused us ofrisking the whole future of the nation by engaging in unilateral disarmament.I would like to believe that criticisms bracketing our policy in that fashionprove it to be rational and sound.    But a discrepancy of that order cannot bereassuring.   Rather, it indicates that we have failed to convey to some partof our audience even the broadest outlines, as we see them, of the problems that our military strategy and force structure are meant to address.   I believewe iksuid be able  6 meve from ednifdvsfsy eft feat scale tswafd ed&amp;stmsug in military affairs, not always on details or components of our policies.MORE
but at least on an appreciation of the major national security problemsconfronting us, Von the broad alternative paths to their solution and onthe dominant goals, obstacles, costs and risks affecting choice.   Mypurpose in speaking to you this evening is to help move in this direction.As a prelude, then, to the coming season of debate, I should liketo identify and discuss some basic matters on which a considerabledegree of consensus seems to me both possible and desirable, althoughby no means assured.These include those over-all comparative strengths and weak-nesses of the opposing military alliances that form the bold relief in the strategic environment.   In short, they are the considerations that seemto have relatively long-term significance compared to the annualbudget cycle.Matters of that degree of permanence tend to be stamped on our minds as being unchanging and unchangeable, the unquestioned framework of daily and yearly policy-making    Yet these factors of which I shallspeak do change:  more swiftly and more profoundly than our picture ofthem tends to change.   Indeed, I believe it is just the fact that over thelast decade this topography has changed --; while many maps have not that accounts for some apparently irreconcilable controversies.Let me recall the earlier period briefly, for comparison.   the strategic landscape at the outset of the &apos;Fifties was dominated by two
outstanding features.   One was the practical U. S. monopoly of deliver-able, strategic nuclear weapons.   The other was the Soviet Union and communist Ctvin&amp;&apos;s virtual monopoly of ground force on the eemtisiepta\of Europe and Asia,Both;of these determinants of Western military policy had changedconsiderably by the end of the Korean War.   The Soviets had producedatomic explosions and had created a sizable nuclear delivery capabilityagainst Europe, while NATO ground forces had expanded rapidly, andmilitary operations in Korea had greatly tarnished the significance of chinese Communist superiority in numbers.   But the old notions of monopoly persisted as short-cut aids to thinking on policy matters.And they were not so misleading as they came later to be.   Soviet armed forces approaching five million men still heavily outweighed the NATOforces in Europe; and Soviet delivery capability against the U.S. wasdwarfed by that of SAC.   Moreover, tactical nuclear weapons were beingheralded as a new nuclear monopoly for the West.Even as these earlier notions of monopolies grew obsolete, ideasabout the feasibility of alternative policies continued to reflect them.So.did ideas about how wars might be fought.   Nuclear operations, bothstrategic and tactical, by the U.S. in response to Soviet aggression against our allies were, considered to be virtually unilateral.   Hence itwas supposed the problem of credibility of the U.S. response would
scarcely arise, even in the case of relatively limited Soviet aggressions.Western reliance upon nuclear weapons, in particular strategic systems,hath fce date 9 and t&amp; oppose nann&amp;uelea? atflaete $iai&amp;y1 &amp;iw seemed not onlyadequate but also unique in its adequacy.That sort of situation is convenient for policy-makers.   It makespolicy easy to choose and easy to explain.   Perhaps that is why throughoutmost of the 1 Fifties, while the Soviets under various pressures decreasedtheir ground forces and the NATO allies built theirs up, and while the soviets acquired a massive nuclear threat against Europe and laid thegroundwork for a sizable threat against the U.S., the picture underlyingmost policy debate remained that appropriate to 1949.   It was a picture of a Communist Goliath in conventional strength facing a Western David,almost naked of conventional arms but alone possessed of a nuclear sling.Toward the end of that decade, the prospect that the Soviets wouldacquire intercontinental ballistic missiles at a time when our strategicforces consisted almost entirely of bombers focused our attention and ourbudget even more sharply than before upon our strategic forces.   the urgency of the problem of deterring the most massive of attacks was anew reason for thinking that the West could spare neither resources  northought to deal more specifically with lesser threats.   The most urgenttask was to provide for deterrence of massive aggression by assuringthe survival under any attack of forces at least adequate, in the calculations
of a potential attacker, to destroy his society in retaliation.   It was nownot the assurange of continued nuclear superiority that preempted theattention of po&amp;cy-makers but, on the contrary, the struggle to maintain it,IIBut it is time for the maps to change by which policy is chartedand justified.   The old ones, which assumed a U.S. nuclear monopoly,both strategic and tactical, and a Communist monopoly of ground combatstrength, are too far removed from reality to serve as even rough guides.Neither we nor our allies can afford the crudities of maps that tell us that old policies are still forced upon us, when a true picture would showimportant new avenues of necessity and choice.What most needs changing is a picture of ourselves and of theWestern Alliance as essentially at bay, outmanned and outgunned exceptfor nuclear arms no longer exclusively ours.   We should not think ofourselves as forced by limitations of resources to rely upon strategiesof desperation and threats of vast mutual destruction, compelled to dealonly with the most massive and immediate challenges, letting lesserones go by default.   It would be a striking historical phenomenon if thatself-image should be justified.   We are the largest member of an alliance with a population of almost 4$0 rajiijgn people, an. aggregate &amp;mmlproduct which is fast approaching a trillion dollars, and a modern anddiverse technological base without parallel^ facing the Soviet Union and
[jits European satellites with their hundtred million fewer people and an aggregate output no more than half that of the West.And quite apart from ignoring the underlying strengths of the West,I jie outdated picture I have described takes no account of the military- &apos;;apabilities in being that our investment over the last decade, and; (pacifically in the last few years, have bought for us.   If new problems\ iut strong claims on our attention and our resources today, it is veryI argely because we have come a large part of the way that is feasibleEg iHoward solving some old ones.Let me summarize the current status of the balance of strategicIiuclear forces, that part of the military environment that has preoccupiednur attention for so long.   In strictly relative numerical terms, the( situation is the familiar one.   The U. S. force now contains more thanj iOO operational long-range ballistic missiles -- ATLAS, TITAN,j&apos;iflNUTEMAN, POLARIS -- and is planned to increase to over 1700 byI 1966.   There is no doubt in our minds and none in the minds of the Sovietsj hat these missiles can penetrate to their targets.   In addition, the U.S.lias Strategic Air Command bombers on air alert and over 500 bombers oni pick reaction ground alert. By comparison, the consensus is -that today the[Soviets could place about half as many bombers over North America onIi first strike.   The Soviets are estimated to have today only a fractionLas many intercontinental missiles as we do.   Furthermore, their
submarine-launched ballistic missiles are short range, and generally are not comparable to our POLARIS force.1 The Soviets pose a verylarge threat against Europe, including hundreds of intermediate and medium-range ballistic missiles.   This threat is today and will continueto be covered by the clear superiority of our strategic forces.The most wishful of Soviet planners would have to calculate as acertainty that the most effective surprise attack they could launch would still leave us with the capability to destroy the attacker&apos;s society.What is equally pertinent is that the relative numbers and survivability of u.S. strategic forces would permit us to retaliate against all the urgentSoviet military targets that are subject to attack, thus contributing tothe limitation of damage to ourselves and our allies.Deterrence of deliberate, calculated attack seems as well assuredas it can be, and the damage-limiting capability of our numericallysuperior forces is, I believe, well worth its incremental cost.   It is acapability to which the smaller forces of the Soviet Union could notrealistically aspire.   That is one reason, among others, why I wouldnot trade our strategic posture for that of the Soviets at any point duringthe coming decade.But given the kind of force that the Soviets are building, includingsubmarine-launched missiles beyond the reach of our offensive forces,the damage which the Soviets could inflict on us and our allies, no matter what we do to limit it, remains extremely high.
illThat has been true for our allies ever since the middle and late&quot;Fifties.   Soviet acquisition of a sizable delivery capability against theTJ.S. s and more significantly their acquisition of relatively protectedforces, submarine-rlaunched or hardened, has been long and oftenprematurely heralded.   Its arrival at last merely dramatizes the need to recognize that strategic nuclear war would under all foreseeablecircumstances be bilateral -- and highly destructive to both sides.Larger budgets for U.S. strategic forces would not change thatfact.   They could have only a decreasing incremental effect in limitingsomewhat the damage that the U.S. and its allies could suffer in ageneral nuclear war.   In short, we cannot buy the capability to make a strategic bombing campaign once again a unilateral prospect.That must, I suggest, be accepted as one of the determinantsaffecting policy.   Another is that the same situation confronts the soviet leaders, in a way that is even more intensely confining.   In fact,enormous increases in Soviet budgets would be required for them to achieve any significant degree of damage-limiting capability.   Thepresent Soviet leaders show no tendency to challenge the basis of theU.S. strategic deterrent posture by such expenditures.In the last two years alone, we have increased the number of nuclear warheads in the strategic alert forces by 100%. During thatperiod we have more than doubled the megatonnage of the strategic
alert forces.   The fact that further increases in;strategic force size willat last encounter?rapidly diminishing returns -- which is largely an effectof the very large ^vestments the U.S. has made in this area      should be&apos;&amp;).reflected in futur^?budgets.   The funding for the initial introduction ofWmissiles into our forces is nearing completion.   We can anticipate thatthe annual expenditure on strategic forces will drop substantially, andlevel off well below the present rate of spending.   This is not to rule outthe possibility that research now in progress on possible new technologicaldevelopments, including the possibility of useful ballistic missile defenses,will require major new expenditures.   In any event, there will be recurringcosts of modernisation,In the field of tactical nuclear weapons, the picture is in important respects similar.   The U.S. at present has in stockpile or planned forstockpile tens of thousands of nuclear explosives for tactical use on the battlefield, in anti-submarine warfare and against aircraft.   They includewarheads for artillery, battlefield missiles, demolition munitions,bombs, depth charges, air-to-air missiles and surface-to-air missiles.The consensus is that the U.S. is presently substantially superior in design, diversity and numbers in this class of weapons.This is an indispensable superiority, as we can readily understandif we consider how our problems of strategic choice would be altered ifthe tables were reversed and it were the Soviet Union which held a
commanding lead in this field.   Nevertheless, what we have is superiority,not monopoly;, and even if tactical nuclear warfare can be limited, belowsome ill-defined threshold of strategic exchange, the key fact is that if theWest initiates such^rarfare in the future   it must be expected to bebilateral, in any theater which engaged the Soviet Union.   Again, wecannot buy back a monopoly, or the assurance of unilateral use.Finally, there is the area of what we call our general purposeforces.   Within the last two years, we have increased the number of ourcombat-ready Army divisions by about 45%, from 11 to 16,   There hasbeen a 30% increase in the number of tactical air squadrons; a 75%increase in airlift capabilities; and a 100% increase in ship construction and conversion to modernize the fleet.But it is not only force size that matters.   The key to the effective utilization of these forces is combat readiness and mobility.The most recent demonstration of our ability to reinforce our troops presently stationed in Europe occurred last month in OperationSIS hWfi &amp;8 3sst 9l i gsrigs e! &amp;Mm$&amp; tergal sai&amp;) mM&apos;M^,exercises.   For the first time in military history, an entire division was airlifted from one continent to another.   That movement could      ,never have been accomplished without a massive increase in our airliftcapability, which is still being expanded.   (It will have risen 400%between 1961 and 1967.)  It required the development of new techniques
to preposition combat equipment, of which we have two extra divisionsets now in Europe. It called for new techniques in military training jjand administration to make sure that units are really ready to move out Ion a momeriffts notice. This exercise, in which some 16,000 airmen and Isoldiers and%nore than 350 planes took part, is directly relevant to the 1needs of Europe, where it brought a seventh division to join the six that   j;-are to remain in place.   It is also relevant to the ability of the U.S. tofulfill its policy commitments world-wide,, swiftly and in effective strength&quot; -&apos;     &quot;&apos;&quot;t&apos; &quot;v*&quot;&quot;-iBut* it might be asked, what is the signifieattee ol all this for the irealistic security problems of the United States and its allies? To what   I&apos; i&apos; Icontingencies are these forces expected to contribute, and how effective. IImight they be, measured against the strength of opposing forces?   How-meaningful is it to talk of 16 or 20 or 30 divisions in opposing the groundarmies of the Soviet Union and Communist China?Such questions are often meant to be merely rhetorical, in viewof the supposed masses of Communist.troops.   The fact is that they are serious, difficult questions, to which I shall suggest some tentativeanswers.   But it is difficult to encourage realistic discussions of specificcontingencies so long as the shadow of the Communist horde hangsunchallenged over the debate.   The actual contingencies that seem to beto me most likely and most significant are not those which would involveall, or even a major part, of the Soviet Bloc or Chinest Communist
armed forces, nor do they all involve Europe.   Hence, aggregate figuresof armed strength of NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations are not immediately relevant to them.   But it is useful to make these over-allcomparisons precisely because misleading or obsolete notions of the severy aggregates often produce an attitude of hopelessness toward anyattempt to prepare to meet Communist forces in ground combat, howeverlimited in scope.The announced total of Soviet armed forces for 1955 was indeeda formidable 5.75 million men.   Today that figure has been cut to about. 3 million; the Warsaw Pact total including the Soviets is only about .5 million.   Against that, it is today the members of NATO whose activearmed forces number over five million.   The ground forces of NATOnations total 3. 2 million, of which 2. 2 million men are in Europe, asagainst the Soviet ground combat forces total of about 2 million men,and a Warsaw Pact total of about 3 million.   Both the Soviet Union andthe U.S. forces of course include units    stationed in the Far East,   in central Europe, NATO has more men, and more combat troops, on theground than does the Bloc.   It has more men on the ground in &quot;west germany than the Bloc does in East Germany.   It has more and bettertactical aircraft, and these planes on the average can carry twice thepayload twice as far as the Soviet counterparts.
These facts are hard to reconcile with the familiar picture of theRussian Army as incomparably massive.   The usual index cited to supportthat picture is numbers of total active divisions, and the specific numberfamiliar from the past is 175 divisions in the Soviet Army.This total, if true, would indeed present a paradox.   The Sovietground forces are reliably estimated to be very close to two million men,compared to about one million for the U.S.   How is it that the Soviets canmuster ten times the number of active, combat-ready, fully-manneddivisions that the United States has manned, with only twice as many menon active duty?   The answer is simply that they do not.   Recent intensiveinvestigation has shown that the number of active Soviet divisions thatare maintained at manning levels anywhere close to combat readiness is less than half of the 160-175 figure.What remains is a large number, but even that is misleading.For one thing, U.S. divisions have about twice as many men in the division unit and its immediate combat supporting units as comparableSoviet divisions.   AD.S, mechanized division has far more personnel inmaneuvering units, far more in armored cavalry, far more engineers,far more signals, far more light armored personnel carriers, and far more aircraft available in support than Soviet divisions.   In addition tolonger staying power, much of the U.S. manpower and equipment marginis muscle that would make itself felt oh D-Day.   If, on the other hand.
we were to reorganize along Soviet lines, we could display far greaternumbers of divisions comparable to those of the Soviets,The Sevi^ combat-ready force remains a formidable one.in particular, tfcpsy have a large number of lightly manned or cadredivisions to be filled out on mobilization.   Still, this reality remainsstrikingly different from our accustomed maps of it.I do not wish to suggest that such aggregate comparisons are by themselves a valid index to military capabilities.   But they are enough tosuggest the absurdity, as a picture of the prevailing military strengthson which new efforts might build, of David and Goliath notions borrowedfrom 1949.None of this is to say that NATO strength on the ground in europe is adequate to turn back without nuclear weapons an all-out surprisenon-nuclear attack.But that is not in any case the contingency toward which therecent and future improvements in the mobility and capabilities of u.S. general purpose forces are primarily oriented.   Aggression onthat scale would mean a war about the future of Europe and, as a consequence, the future of the UvS. and the USSR.   In the face ofthreats of that magnitude, our nuclear superiority remains highlyrelevant to deterrence.   The Soviets know that even non-nuclear
aggression at that high end of the spectrum of conflict so threatensour most vital interests that we and our allies are prepared to makewhatever response may be required to defeat it, no matter howterrible the consequences for our own society.The probability that the Soviet leaders would choose to invokethat exchange seems to me very low indeed.   They know well whateven the Chinese Communist leaders must recognize upon furtherreflection, that a nuclear war would mean destruction of everythingthey have built up for themselves during the last 50 years.. ^If we were to consider a spectrum of the possible cases of communist aggression, then, ranging from harassment, covertaggression and indirect challenge at one end of the scale to themassive invasion of &quot;Western Europe or a full scale nuclear strikeagainst the West atthg 9&amp;gr en4i it ii clear     pur nucjggr gupgrjkority has been and should continue to be an effective deterrent to aggresion at the high end of the spectrum.   It is equally clear, onthe other hand, that at the very low end of the spectrum a nuclearresponse may not be fully credible, and that nuclear power alonecannot be an effective deterrent at this level in the future any morethan it has been in the past.
The fact is that at every level of force, the Alliance in general,and the U. S. Armed Forces in particular, have greater and more effectivestrength than we are in the habit of thinking we have.-- and with reasonablecontinued effort we can have whatever strength we need,   I have spokenalready of strategic weapons, where the great superiority of the UnitedStates is the superiority also of the Alliance.   In tactical nuclear weaponsa parallel superiority exists -- and while many of our Allies   share with usin manning the systems which would use these tactical warheads in the hourof need, it is  not unfair to point out that, even more than in the strategicfielda the tactical nuclear strength of the Alliance is a contribution of theUnited States.   That strength has been increased, on the ground in Europe,by more than 60% in the last two years.   Today the thousands of U. S.warheads deployed on the continent for the immediate defense of Europehave a combined explosive strength more than 10, 000 times the force ofthe nuclear weapons used to end the Second War. . Tactical nuclear strengththe Alliance has today, and we have provided it.But neither we nor  our Allies can find the detonation of suchweapons --and their inevitable bilateral exchange -- an easy first choice.At the lower end of the spectrum, therefore, we also need strong and ready conventional forces.   We have done our part here and we continueto believe it just      and practicable -- for our partners to do theirs.
The most difficult questions arise over the best means for meetingia variety of dangerous intermediate challenges in many parts of the world:I *        &apos; &apos;those which threaten the possibility of sizable conflict while still notraising the immediate issue of the national survival of ourselves or ofany member of our alliances.   Conflicts might arise out of Soviet sub-version and political aggression backed up by military measures in non-NATO areas in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.There is a range of challenges that could arise from Communist Chinaand its satellites in the Far East and in Southeast Asia.   Most danger-ously, approaching the upper end of the spectrum, there is the possibilityof limited Soviet pressures on NATO territory itself, along the vastfront running from Norway to Greece and Turkey.   Both the flanksand the center contain potential targets.   And always, of course, thereare the contingencies that could arise in relation to Berlin.It is difficult to say just how probable any of these circum-stances might be, although they must be regarded as more likely thanstill larger aggressions.   What one can say is that if any of these more likely contingencies should arise, they would be highly dangerous.Inaction, or weak action, could result in a serious setback, missedopportunity or even disaster.   In fact, if either a nuclear exchange ora major Soviet attack should occur, it would most likely arise from a
conflict on a lesser scale, which Western capabilities had failed to deterand which an inadequate Western response had failed to curb in time.Since World. War 11, the expansionist impulse of the CommunistBloc is clear, bujb/equally clear is its desire to avoid direct confrontationwith the military forces of the free world.   In Greece, in Berlin, and inCuba,&apos; Communists have probed for military and political weakness but when they have encountered resistance, they have held back.   Not onlyCommunist doctrine has counselled this caution, but respect fox thedanger that any sizable, overt conflict would lead to nuclear war.   Itwould follow that no deterrent would be more effective against theselesser and intermediate levels of challenge than the assurance thatsuch moves would certainly meet prompt, effective military responseby the West.   That response could confront the Soviets with frustrationof their purposes unless they chose themselves to escalate the conflictto a nuclear exchange, or to levels that made nuclear war highlyprobable --a choice they are unlikely to make in the face of ourdestructive power.The basis for that particular assurance cannot be systems in development, or weapons in storage depots, or reserves that must bemobilized, trained and equipped, or troops without transport.   We need the right combination of forward deployment and highly mobile combat-&apos;
ready ground, sea and air units, capable of prompt and effectivecommitment to j^tual combat, in short, the sort of capability we areincreasingly building in our forces.This capability requires of us     as of our Allies   a militaryestablishment that is, in the Presidents words,lean and fit.   We muststop and ask ourselves before deciding whether to add a new and complex weapon system to our inventory, whether it is really themost effective way to do the job under the rigorous conditions ofcombat.   We must examine constantly the possibilities for combiningfunctions, particularly in weapons that could be used by two or moreServices.   Given this tough-minded sense of reality about the require-merits of combat readiness, it should be possible for the United Statesnot only to maintain&apos;but to expand this increased strength withoutoverall increases in our defense budget.   As our national productivity and our gross national product expand, the defense budget therefore neednot keep pace.   Indeed, it appears likely that measured in relative --and perhaps even absolute -- terms, the defense budget will level off and perhaps decline a little.   At the same time, we are continuing theessential effort to reduce the impact of Defense spending on our balanceof payments.: We have already brought this figure down from $2.7 billion
in FY 1961 to $1.7 billion for FY 1963, and we shall continue to reduceit, without reducing the combat ground for ces deployed in Europe, and while strengthening our overall combat effectiveness.And it must be our policy to continue to strengthen our combateffectiveness.   I do not regard the present Communist leaders aswholly reckless in action.   Eut recent experience, in Cuba and, on a lesser scale, in Berlin, has not persuaded me that I can predict with confidence the sorts of challenges that Communist leaders will come to think prudent and profitable.   If they were again to miscalcu-late as dangerously as they did a year ago, it would be essential toconfront them, wherever that might be, with the full consequences oftheir action:  the certainty of meeting immediate, appropriate, and fully effective military action.All of our strengths, including our strategic and tactical nuclear forces, contributed last year, and they would contribute in similar future situations to the effectiveness of our response, by providing a basis for assurance that the Soviets would not dangerouslyescalate or shift the locale of the conflict.   But above all, in order tofashion that response, and to promise the Soviets local defeat in caseof actual ground conflict, we had to use every element of the improve-ments in combat readiness and mobility that had been building over
the preceding year and a half, including combat divisions, air transport,and tactical air.   And the last ingredient was also there; the will to usethose forces against Soviet troops and equipment.Let us not delude ourselves with obsolete images into believing that our nuclear strength, great as it is, solves all of our problems ofnational security, or that we lack the strengths to meet those problems that it does not solve.   In the contingencies that really threaten -- the sort that have occurred and will occur again -- we and our allies needno longer cnoose to live with the sense or the reality of inferiority to theSoviet Bloc in relevant, effective force.   Let us be fully aware of the wide range of our military resources, and the freedom they can give us to pursue the peaceful objectives of the free world without fear ofmilitary aggression.S IT D
