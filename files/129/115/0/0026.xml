confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1963CP. (63) 26 Copy No.   513rd December, 1963CABINETCONTINUATION BEYOND AGE 18 OF ALLOWANCES FOR children of WIDOWSMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceAt the meeting of the Cabinet on 21st November (CM. (63) 7th Conclusions,Item 7) I was asked to circulate a memorandum on the desirability of assistingwidowed mothers by continuing to pay allowances under the national insurancescheme, which otherwise stop when the children reach the age of 18.2.  The present position is as follows:(i) A widowed mother qualifies for an allowance if she has living with hera child under 18. She gets 67s. 6d. for herself; in addition she gets 30s.for a child under 18 if he comes within the definition of a &quot; child &quot; inthe Family Allowances Act one who is in full-time education or anapprentice earning not more than 40s. a week net.(ii) If a widowed mother is over 50 when her youngest child reaches 18, shebecomes entitled to a widow&apos;s pension at the rate of 67s. 6d. If she isstill under 50 at that time, she is treated just like a childless widowunder 50 and gets no widow&apos;s pension. (A widow who is not entitled toa widow&apos;s pension is given contribution concessions to enable her to qualify immediately for sickness and unemployment benefits if shecannot work.)(iii) The above definition of a &quot; child &quot; in the Family Allowances Act appliesthroughout the insurance scheme for purposes of child dependencybenefit. The weekly rates of benefit for children under the insurancescheme take account of the family allowances that are payable. widowed mothers thus get 30s. for the eldest child, for whom no family allowance is paid; 22s. plus 8s. family allowances for the second child; and 22s. plus10s. for subsequent children. People who are ill or out of work get 20s.for the eldest child; 12s. plus 8s. family allowances for the second child;and 12s. plus 10s. for subsequent children.3. If the age limit for the child&apos;s element in widowed mother&apos;s allowance were extended beyond 18 for children remaining in full-time education, the widowedmother&apos;s personal allowance would also have to be continued. This continuation and title to a succeeding widow&apos;s pension would then depend (as it does not atpresent) on the child remaining in full-time education. The pressure on the child todo so might be intolerable.4. In order to avoid this, entitlement to the personal allowance would haveto continue (as it does at present until the child is 18), whether or not the childremained in full-time education. Some new age limit would then be necessary. this might be 19 or 20, but it would be hard to justify anything older, which would allowwidowed mothers to go on drawing their personal allowance when their childrenwere grown up and at work, possibly married and themselves parents. Those whowent on with their education at universities and similar institutions would be coveredby educational grants.5. If the age limit were raised for widows&apos; children, it would have to be raised for other children who remained in full-time education. Allowances for the children of national insurance beneficiaries generally (for example, the long-term sick or theunemployed) would also have to go on beyond 18.3589
6. The age limit for family allowances would also need extension, because ofthe close link which has always existed between them and national insuranceallowances for children. It is the Family Allowances Act which contains the definition of a child for purposes of national insurance children&apos;s allowances. Without a similarextension of family allowances, it would only be possible to continue benefits for children of national insurance beneficiaries remaining in full-time education bymeans of complicated national insurance legislation. The political difficulty ofomitting family allowances would be increased by the very legislation needed to omit them.7. As one of the Cabinefs main objects was to find some means of helping the widowed mothers themselves, I have examined the possibility of allowing themto qualify automatically for widow&apos;s pension, even if they are under 50 when their youngest children become 18. If this could be done without inequity, there might be advantages in choosing this method, rather than keeping the widowedmother&apos;s personal allowance going by continuing the child&apos;s allowance well beyondthe age of 18.1 am afraid, however, that the principle of &quot; once a widowed mother,always a widow (for national insurance purposes) &quot; would never seem fair to the widow whose husband dies before she is 50 and who does not qualify for a pensionbecause she never had any children; or to the widow under 50, whose children weregrown up before her husband died.8. I am therefore forced to the conclusion that an extension of the age limit to 19 or 20 for both national insurance child dependants and family allowances isthe only practical way of helping in my field. i am not convinced that this method,any more than others we have discussed, will greatly reduce pressure on the earnings rule (Mr. McLeavy, who drew eighth in the ballot, says he will bring ina Bill to abolish it). It could, however, be represented as a selective move for thosenational insurance beneficiaries (widowed mothers, sick, unemployed) who hadchildren in full-time education beyond the age of 18.9.  An age-limit of 19 would run us into much less trouble than one of 20 (a) in the borderland between school and further education; 19 reflects more appropriately than 20 the transition from school to university; and,after 19, many more children continuing their education qualify for educational grants (subject to their own means test);(b) in the extension of the age for family allowances (which are paidirrespective of the parents&apos; income).10. The legislation required would be short and fairly simple. The mainprovision would be to amend the Family Allowances Act by substituting the higherage for 18. As Exchequer money would be involved, it might be possible to draw the financial resolution tightly and prevent amendment in the House to a still higherage. The National Insurance Act allows a widowed mother&apos;s personal allowance togo on until her child reaches 18 where he leaves school before that but continues to live at home. This would also need amendment and would extend the scope of theBill, so that discussion might be allowed on the conditions for the widowed mother&apos;allowance in general, including the earnings rule. As money from the national insurance funds would be involved, there would be no protection here from thefinancial resolution.11. The cost of extending the age limits to 19, as set out above, for the children of widowed mothers and other national insurance beneficiaries, and for family allowances, would be about  2 million a year, rising within 10 years to about 3\ million a year. Each of these amounts would include about  1 million a year for family allowances paid from the Exchequer. The rest would come from thenational insurance funds and would nearly all go to widows in the form of allowances for widowed mothers and their children, and widows&apos; pensions. Thesecosts would be nearly doubled if the age limits were raised to 20.R. W.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C. 22nd December, 1963.
