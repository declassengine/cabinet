(63) 4thConclusions, Minute 1) that I should announce in the course of the debate on the Address estimates of public expenditure in 1967-68implied by the Governments present policies.    As a result we havebeen challenged to publish a White Paper giving a more comprehensivepicture of the growth of public expenditure.    I think it would be highly advantageous to answer this challenge, and to do so quicklyby publishing a White  Paper before the Christmas R.recess.The attached proof is based on a draft prepared by theTreasury, and subsequently amended in the light of discussion with departments.    It is to be considered by the Economic PolicyCommittee today, and I will report that Committee&apos;s findings to theCabinet on Thursday, 12th December.    Further adjustments to the text may have to be made at the proof stage to take account both ofthe Economic Policy Committee&apos;o discussion and the subsequentexamination by the Cabinet.

PUBLIC EXPENDITUREin 1963-64 and 1967-68
PART public EXPENDITURE surveys. In the Budget speech of 1961 the then Chancellor of the exchequer said :&quot; We need increasingly to look at all public expenditure togetherinstead of piecemeal, and to look at it for a period of years in relation toprospective resources. I have recently set in hand a study of the whole problem of public expenditure in relation to the prospective future growth of our resources for a period of five years ahead. If we look back for adecade, it will be found that, for a time after 1951, total public expenditure and in this I include the whole of the public sector, central and localgovernment, above- and below-the-line, the National Insurance funds,and the capital expenditures of nationalised industries rose more slowlythan the gross national product. This was largely due to a reduction inthe proportion taken by defence. But the process was reversed threeyears ago, and the share of our total product taken for public purposes isrising again, and rising appreciably. The object of carrying out the studywhich 1 have just mentioned is to see how we can best keep public expendi-ture in future years in proper relationship to the growth of our national product.&quot;(Official Report, 17th April, 1961, cols. 793-794).2. Similarly, the report of the Plowden Committee on the Control of public expenditure (published in July 1961 as Cmnd. 1432) contained the following recommendation (paragraph 12) : &quot; Regular surveys should be made of public expenditure as a whole,over a period of years ahead, and in relation to prospective resources ;decisions involving substantial future expenditure should be taken in thelight of these surveys.&quot;3. The first full-scale survey of prospective public expenditure in relationto resources took place in 1961, making use of techniques which the treasury had been developing in earlier studies on a smaller scale. Surveys are now made annually and have become an established part of the Governmentsmachinery for the appraisal and control of public expenditure.4. The Plowden Committee called attention to the difficulties which any government might be expected to find in publication of the results of thesesurveys. But the Government believe that the publication of expenditure figures derived from the latest survey can make a valuable contribution to public understanding.5. This White Paper shows an estimate of total public expenditure in1963/64 and an approximate calculation of the prospective level of public expenditure in 1967/68 at constant prices (as defined in paragraph 11) on thebasis of the Governments present policies and programmes.6. With the exception of debt interest (dealt with in paragraph 9 below), the survey covers all central and local government capital and current expenditure,the gross outgoings of the national insurance funds and investment expenditure by the nationalised industries and public corporations.2
SECRET7. This wide definition has been adopted for three reasons: (a) The Government have a measure of responsibility and control over thewhole public sector.(b) The Exchequer and other sources of finance for the various public services are so interlocked that these services cannot reasonably beconsidered in terms of Exchequer expenditure alone.(c) In looking forward the Government must examine the expenditure atthe point at which it is made, not where it is ultimately financed.They must in this context be concerned with education expenditure,not the general grant; with national insurance pensions, not withthe Exchequer contribution to the national insurance funds; withnationalised industries&apos; investment, not with their borrowing.8. The total of public expenditure is divided for purposes of appraisal andcontrol into functional blocks comparable with the analysis used (in relation toSupply expenditure) in Table II of the Memorandum by the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury on the 1963/64 Estimates. Although the main components oftotal public expenditure classified in economic terms can be derived from the blue Book National Income and Expenditure for past years, this is not atpresent possible for the functional analysis of the total. It is intended in the1964 Blue Book to publish such an additional analysis and to establish a greaterdegree of uniformity in functional, as well as economic terms between nationalaccounting practice and the categories used in the management of public expenditure. The Blue Book relates to the whole of the United Kingdom, butthe surveys of public expenditure are concerned primarily with expenditure by public authorities of Great Britain. The individual functional headings excludeexpenditure by Northern Ireland public authorities which is treated separately.(See paragraph 29).9. Debt interest, although a part of total public expenditure, is not covered in these forward surveys, because the forecasting of it is dependent on a numberof arbitrary assumptions about the level of expenditure, taxation and interest rates over the whole of the intervening period. * Some figures of public expendi-ture, including debt interest for past years, are, however, shown in Annex A.10. The extent to which public expenditure other than debt interest can beaccurately forecast varies from item to item. In some fields Departments havebeen able to make projections of expenditure on the basis of specified policies and programmes ; in others the nature of the policy is such that it is necessaryto include figures based on the projection of past and current trends or on someother appropriate assumption.11. The figures given for 1967/68 do not represent decisions by the Govern-ment to spend particular sums in that year. The firmness of the individualfigures varies widely but, taken as a whole, the costing is as accurate and realisticas the Government can make it at the present time. Purchases of goods and services are expressed in terms of constant prices : for current expenditure the* But the expenditure covered by the surveys includes an allowance for imputed rent on certain assets owned and used by public authorities. In accordance with the practice adopted for National Income Statistics, this imputed rental is in some cases based on the interest and capital repayments in respect of the debt incurred to acquire the assets.52157B
figures are based on the 1963/64 Budget Estimates ; for investment expenditurethey are at March 1963 prices. The figures for national insurance and other social security benefits allow for the implementation of the Governments policy to give beneficiaries a continuing share in rising prosperity ; for the purposeof this survey this has been interpreted as calling for increases in line with thegrowth of real earnings. Such payments as grants and loans to industry, sub-subsidies and overseas aid are related to current levels of prices. These price basesare referred to collectively as &quot; Survey 1963 prices &quot;.4SECRET
SECRETPART IIEXPENDITURE IN 1963/64 AND 1967/6812. The following table compares an estimate of Public Expenditure in1963/64 with the results of the calculation of the prospective level of public expenditure in 1967/68 on the basis of the Governments present policies and programmes.TOTAL PUBLIC EXPENDITURE	  million at Survey 1963 prices			1963/64	1967/68	IncreaseDefence	1,905	2,170	4265Aid and other overseas expenditure	310	365	4- 55Roads         ..........	360	470	+ 110Housing and environmental services	1,135	1,295	4-160Education	1,260	1,570	+ 310Health and welfare ..      ......	1,020	1,160	4-140Benefits and assistance      ......	1,745	2,095	4 350Children&apos;s services	290	315	4 25Police and prisons	200	230	4- 30Assistance to agriculture, industry and			transport	665	650	- 15Investment by nationalised industries and			public corporations	1,135	1,330	4195Administrative and other services	705	725	4 20Contingency allowance	 	250	 Adjustments ..      ..      ......	180	200	Total public expenditure	10,910	12,825	41,915The prospective increase in the four years is calculated at about  1,915 million, or 17-^ percent, equivalent to an annual increase of 4 -1 per cent, at Survey 1963 prices.Defence13. This covers not only the defence budget and also net expenditure onthe Purchasing (Repayment) Services (through which the purchases of militaryand certain other equipment are financed) and civil defence. considerations of security restrict the information which can be given.Aid and other overseas expenditure14. Under this heading is grouped expenditure on overseas aid, information,representation, etc., and certain subscriptions to international organisations.The figures provide for a continuing increase in aid expenditure.Roads15. Total expenditure by the central Government and local authorities on roads, including related expenditure on street lighting and car parks, is expectedto increase at 7 -2 per cent per annum on average, from  360 million in 1963/64to  470 million in 1967/68. Capital expenditure on new construction and major improvements of motor-ways, trunk roads and classified roads (including5
those in urban areas) rises from  140 million to  225 million, or by 60 per cent,over the period after allowing for the additional investment in roads approved for North-East England and Central Scotland. The  225 million represents the1967/68 tranche of the latest five-year road building programme announced bythe Minister of Transport on 22nd October and the corresponding figure forScotland. The remaining expenditure is investment in unclassified roads, roadlighting and car parks and current expenditure on maintenance and minor improvements.Housing and environmental services16. Expenditure on housing includes several types of expenditure; investment in new housing by local authorities, new town development corporations andthe Scottish Special Housing Association; the Exchequer and local authoritysubsidies; net advances by local authorities, and Exchequer advances to housing associations, for house purchase; and improvement grants by local authorities.Under this same heading is also included expenditure on water and sewerage,land drainage, coast protection, general local government services such as theprovision of recreational facilities, expenditure under the Town and country planning Acts (mostly urban redevelopment) and local administration. here will fall a considerable part of the increase in expenditure arising out of theGovernments proposals for the development of North-East England and central Scotland.17. The allowance for investment in public housing provides for an ex-penditure of  440 million in 1967/68, compared with  395 million for 1963/64.The figure for 1967/68 is related to the Governments intention to reach and maintain a level of building 400,000 houses a year, public and private, in thesecond half of the 1960s. The environmental services are necessarily associatedwith housing development, and investment expenditure on them also showssteady growth, from  215 million in 1963/64 to almost  260 million in 1967/68.18. In arriving at a figure for expenditure other than investment, the totalhousing subsidy bill is taken to rise from  140 million in 1963/64 to  165 million in 1967/68. Expenditure on the remaining items under this heading, includingloans by local authorities for house purchase and improvement, and exchequer loans to housing associations, is assumed to rise from  380 million in 1963/64to  430 million in 1967/68.Education19. This block of expenditure covers the whole field of education fromprimary schools to universities, and the figures allow for an average annual increase of 5 -9 per cent at constant prices over the period. This illustrates theimportance which the Government attach to education and its development in the light of the Robbins and the Newsom Reports. The bulk of the ex-penditure is current expenditure; and allowance has been made for increases in local authority current expenditure as the numbers in schools, technical colleges and teachers&apos; training colleges increase, and in the Governments recurrentgrants to Universities, together with the associated increase in the number of student awards. The rate of growth also allows for the increased school andfurther education building programmes already announced, and for the capital programmes for the Universities and other institutions of higher education.6
Health and welfare20. Allowance is made for total expenditure (capital and current) on health and welfare to grow at an annual average rate of 3 -3 per cent per annum at constant prices. The figures provide for the development of the hospitals andlocal health and welfare services in accordance with the Government^ 10-yearplans. They allow for a rise in investment expenditure from  80 million in1963/64 to  115 million in 1967/68 an average annual rate of increase ofover 10 per cent. Provision has also been made for the growth of the otherparts of the National Health Service.Benefits and assistance21. Even if there were no further changes in rates of benefit, it is estimatedthat expenditure on national insurance benefits, war pensions, non-contributoryold age pensions and national assistance would in any case rise substantiallybecause of the continuing increase in the number of retirement pensioners.The Governments policy envisages that recipients of national insurance andother social security benefits will continue to share in the rising prosperitywhich a steadily expanding economy will bring. For the purposes of thissurvey it has been assumed that from 1963/64 increases in the level of benefits and assistance will in real terms be broadly in line with the increase in real earnings per head corresponding to the growth of productivity implied in anincrease of 4 per cent per annum in the Gross National Product at constant prices. On this basis total expenditure under this heading would rise from 1,745 million in 1963/64 to  2,095 million in 1967/68.Childrerfs services22. Family allowances are the largest item in this group of services ( 140million in 1963/64) ; the other services are school meals and milk, welfare food and child care. The increase in estimated expenditure during the periodcorresponds to the expected increase in the number of children.Police and prisons23. Expenditure is assumed to rise at an annual average rate of 3 -5 percent at constant prices. The major part of police expenditure is on pay andthe figures of future expenditure assume an increase of about 10 per cent inthe total police strength.Assistance to agriculture, industry and transport24. The largest item under this heading in 1963/64 is agricultural support(here estimated at  350 million). The movement of this figure in future yearscannot be forecast since it is affected by changes in the level of supplies andin market prices. Moreover, the Government is at present consideringadaptations in the agricultural support system. In these circumstances theonly practical course for the purpose of the White Paper is to assume for1967/68 a figure for agricultural support of the same order.as that for 1963/64.The total also includes the subsidies to the British Railways and WaterwaysBoards (estimated at about  145 million in 1963/64) as well as other assistanceto specific industries, expenditure on the promotion of local employment, andother services to agriculture, fisheries and forestry. The reduction in the total for all this expenditure, from  665 million to  650 million, therefore reflects7
a reduction in the estimate for the subsidy to the British Railways and Water-ways Boards partly offset by an expected increase in expenditure on other formsof assistance, e.g. grants for industry in the Development Districts and industrial training.Nationalised industries&apos; and public corporations&apos;&apos; investment25. As is shown in the White Paper on Public Investment in Great Britain,October 1963 (Cmnd. 2177), investment by the nationalised industries is increasing very rapidly. It will for some time continue to grow fast, mainly because of the steep increase in investment in electricity and Post Office services,but there is likely to be a reduction in this rate of growth later as the immediate requirements are overcome ; the total is forecast to rise from  1,135 million in1963/64 to about  1,330 million in 1967/68. There necessarily remain, however,substantial uncertainties about the level of investment in that year owing tothe difficulties of forecasting the future evolution of demand and technologicalrequirements.Administrative and other services26. The element included for central administration and allied servicesaccounts for rather more than half the total under this heading ( 410 million in 1963/64) ; on the basis of recent trends it has been forecast to increase at about 1^ per cent per annum.27. The total also includes certain expenditure on civil scientific research and development by the Atomic Energy Authority, the Ministry of Aviation,the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and other research councils. This expenditure is assumed to grow substantially but the increase is partly offset by an expected increase in receipts by the Atomic energy authority as a result of the growing nuclear power programme. Total Govern-ment expenditure on civil research on the basis used in Appendix E of the annual report of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy, 1962/63 (Cmnd. 2163),is assumed to grow from about  170 million in 1963/64 to about  210 million in 1967/68. Much of this expenditure is covered by this paragraph, but someof it is under other headings notably education (universities) and assistance to agriculture, industry and transport.Contingency allowance28. Experience of public expenditure surveys is that (quite apart from any increase in prices) forward estimates tend to put too low a figure on the eventualcost of implementing present policies. A contingency allowance of  250million has therefore been made ; this is about 2 per cent of the total estimatedpublic expenditure in 1967/68.Adjustments29. The adjustments covered by this figure are necessary to put the totalon a basis comparable with the Blue Book National Income and Expenditure.The main addition is on account of expenditure by Northern Ireland public authorities which (as explained in paragraph 8 above) has been excluded fromthe figures under the individual headings.8
PART IIIPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND RESOURCESExpenditure : money and resources30. These forward calculations of public expenditure are expressed in termsof money. To meet this expenditure money must be raised in taxes, local rates,national insurance contributions, etc., or by borrowing by the Exchequer or public authorities (to the extent that the state of the national economy and thelevel of savings enables this to be done without inflationary consequences).31. The wider significance of these expenditures is seen in the demands thatthey make upon the nation&apos;s economic resources man-power, brain-power,machine-power. These are demands upon the Gross National Product, or national production of goods and services.32. About two-thirds of total public expenditure represents direct purchasesby central and local government and the investment of nationalised industries.?&quot;These include the employment of soldiers, teachers, nurses, street cleaners,research scientists, civil servants, etc. ; the purchase of the goods needed tosupply the defence and social services and other government services ; theconstruction of roads, houses, technical colleges, etc. ; and the building andequipment of power stations, coal mines and nationalised industry generally.These purchases in the aggregate are expected to increase by about 18 per centin the four years to 1967/68. Included in this aggregate are the demands for new construction work, which are expected to increase by more than 25 per centin the period.33. The other one-third of public expenditure is grants, benefits, loans,subsidies of various kinds. Some of these, such as national insurance pensionsor students&apos; awards, are to individual people ; some, such as agriculturalsubsidies or Board of Trade grants to firms setting up in development districts,are to businesses : some are to overseas Governments. These payments givethe recipients a claim on the nation&apos;s resources : they enable them to buy goods and services which they could not otherwise have bought.34. All this public expenditure creates a demand on the nation&apos;s productionof goods and services either directly or indirectly. If the demands arising from public expenditure rise faster than the nation&apos;s production, a smaller proportionof the latter is available for exports, private investment and consumption. Inorder to keep room for an adequate rate of growth of exports and private investment, it would then be necessary to restrain the growth of private con-sumption.35. This is where the &quot; physical &quot; approach, which relates public expenditure to the demands upon the nation&apos;s production and resources, fits in with the&quot; fiscal&quot; approach, which relates the public expenditure to the taxes, local rates, etc., which are needed to pay for it; for the growth of private consump-tion is restrained by taxation.* In Annex B total public expenditure is divided into current expenditure on goods and services, gross fixed capital formation and other expenditure on the basis used in the Blue BookNational Income and Expenditure.9
Comparison with prospective resources36. The surveys of public expenditure are designed to enable the Govern-ment to establish a pattern for the future development of the public services which is properly related to the prospective needs of the community and is consistent with, and supports the prospective growth of, the nation&apos;s resources.37. The White Paper shows the total of public expenditure at &quot; Survey1963 &quot; prices as increasing by 4-1 per cent per year between 1963/64 and1967/68. The Government are aiming at a rate of growth of the Gross national product at constant prices of 4 per cent a year on average. This rate of growth,if maintained between now and 1967/68, should be enough to support public expenditure on the general scale foreseen in this White Paper ; and implied by the Governments policies. But if these policies seemed likely to make alarger claim on resources than is here envisaged, or if the prospects for economic growth substantially worsened, it would clearly be necessary for the Governmentto review their policies accordingly.38. If public expenditure and the Gross National Product developed overthe next few years as set out above there would in the event be an increase inthe ratio of public expenditure (excluding debt interest) to Gross national product from the present figure of something like 40 per cent to around 41^per cent.*   The actual figures since 1952 are shown in Annex A.39. It is unlikely that a development of public expenditure on the scaleimplied will leave much scope for a reduction in the burden of taxation. Thelevel of taxation will, of course, be closely affected by the level of savings. Thehigher the levei of savings, the less the need for taxation. The rate of personalsaving has risen in recent years to very high levels, and the governments policies will continue to be directed to encouraging still higher levels of saving.Provided these are achieved, and a 4 per cent rate of growth of the economy ismaintained, the level of total public expenditure implied in this White paper should be within the capacity of the National economy.* If public expenditure and the Gross National Product (G.N.P.) rise at the same rate at constant prices, the ratio of public expenditure to G.N.P. at actual prices will still tend to rise.The reason for this is that services constitute a large part of the purchases made by the public sector and the average price of these purchases rises by more than the price level of the gross national product as a whole, even when this overall level remains stable. This relative riseoccurs because the growth of productivity, as measured in the national income accounts, and hence the offset to rising money incomes, is smaller in the production of the output purchased by the public sector than it is for the economy as a whole.10
