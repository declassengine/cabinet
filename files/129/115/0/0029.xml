CABINETTRIBUNALS OF INQUIRY (EVIDENCE) ACT, 1921Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for theHome Department and the Secretary of State for scotland at their meeting on 14th November, 1963 (CM. (63) 5th Conclusions,Minute 2), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (63) 11) of the 12th November, 1963,about the procedure under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921. after considering that Memorandum the Cabinet invited the Leader of the House ofLords to consider, in the light of their discussion, the possibility of arranging a debate at an early date on the operation of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)Act, 1921. This debate would indicate whether there was any pressure for anindependent inquiry, either by a Royal Commission or otherwise, into the working and procedure of the Act.2. The Leader of the House of Lords invited Lord Colville of Culross to initiate a debate and on 4th December Lord Colville moved the followingResolution:&quot; To call attention to the operation of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)Act, 1921; and to move for Papers.&quot;The debate is reported in the House of Lords Official Report for 4th Decemberat columns 966-1006.3. In the event the debate did not attract a very large attendance and onlyseven Peers spoke. These, however, included both the Lord Chief Justice andLord Simonds, to whose views the House naturally paid great attention. the debate disclosed a striking unanimity of views between the Government, theOpposition and the Peers on the Cross Benches. Almost every speaker expressed his dislike for some aspect of the practice under the Act of 1921 but everyone wasagreed that it was essential for this procedure to be available in case of need. Theviews of the House can perhaps fairly be summed up by the following extractfrom Lord Chorley&apos;s speech (at columns 989 and 990):&quot; Nobody has suggested any real alternative method of dealing withthe sort of situation in which this Act has been used and in which thesetribunals have been set up, so far as I have been able to discover. It is obviousthere must be some way of dealing with this sort of situation. . . .The real point, of course, is that in these cases-1 think in every case most people would agree that where this method has been used the national interest has called urgently for an investigation into a situation fraught with considerable danger to the community as a whole. Until we can devise some more satisfactory method, it seems to me that it is quite essential that thisAct should remain on the Statute Book.&quot;4. A number of suggestions were made during the course of the debate for improving the procedure of Tribunals appointed under the Act and our respective departments are at present considering how far it would be desirable for effectto be given to these proposals. We need not, therefore, trouble our colleagues with any of these suggestions at this stage, except to refer to the proposal, whichwas made by a number of the speakers, that the costs of persons appearing beforeTribunals should be borne by public funds.5. As our colleagues will be aware, the expenses of persons who appeared before Lord Radcliffe&apos;s Inquiry into matters arising out of the Vassall case werethe subject of two Statements in the House of Commons by the Home Secretary.He informed the House that witnesses who had appeared before the Tribunal3625THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1963CP. (63) 29 Copy No.   g \9th December, 1963
and who had been allowed legal representation would have their claims for costsconsidered by the Government. He went on to say that the Members of theTribunal had agreed to advise on the cases in which an ex gratia contributionought to be made to persons5 costs out of public funds. (House of CommonsOfficial Report, 29th November, 1962, at columns 661-665 and 18th December,1962, at columns 1094-1097.)6. Negotiations are at present being carried on with the Solicitors acting for various persons who appeared before the Tribunal, with a view to seekingagreement of their costs, in accordance with the terms announced by the HomeSecretary and in the light of the recommendations made by the Tribunal.7. During the recent debate the Lord Chancellor gave the following replyto the proposals put forward by speakers for costs to be paid out of public funds,or for legal aid to be granted to persons appearing before tribunals. He said:&quot; I do not think it is necessary to introduce legislation in order to securethat the costs of those who are allowed to be represented should be met. your lordships will remember that both in the Waters Case Inquiry and in theVassall Case Inquiry provision was made for the payment of costs, without legislation. I take note of your Lordships&apos; views, which I think come to this,though some will perhaps go further than this: that where someone is entitledto legal representation because it is thought he may be the subject of criticismat the other end of the day, and where he is cleared by the tribunal, thereshould be no doubt that he will be reimbursed the expenses to which he hasbeen put.&quot;(House of Lords Official Report, 4th December, 1963, columns 1002-1003.)8. The debate has received a generally sympathetic Press and it is apparent that, at least at present, there is no pressure for any radical amendment of theprocedure under the Act of 1921 or for the Act itself to be repealed. We thereforeinvite our colleagues&apos; agreement to our view that:(a) There is no case, nor any serious public pressure, for an independentinquiry into the procedure under the Act; and(b) That Government Speakers should take this line when the House ofCommons considers Lord Denning&apos;s Inquiry into allegations arisingfrom Mr. Profumo&apos;s resignation on Monday, 16th December, whileadding that the proposals put forward during the recent debate inthe House of Lords are at present being considered by the Government.D.H. B.M. N.9th December, 1963.
