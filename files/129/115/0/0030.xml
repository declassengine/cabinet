W.19th December, 1963
PRIME MINISTERDecca Radar Installations in IndonesiaAs requested at Wednesday^ meeting of D.O. P. Committee(D. 0.(63) 3rd Meeting) Item 2, Conclusion 3, the Strategic ExportsCommittee gave further consideration this morning to this matter.2.       The arguments against further action are substantial.Briefly they are:(a) That if Decca cease work on the radar chain, it would bepossible for the Indonesians to employ Russian or Americantechnicians to complete the job.   There is no reason tobelieve that this would even result in postponement of its completion.(b) That it is possible that action on our part of this kind mightexpose to further danger our other large commercial assets in Indonesia valued at something between  120 million and 160 million as well as our substantial favourable balanceof trade with that country.(c) That as our powers in the matter are limited to a refusal ofof licences for only some  70, 000 worth of material - theremaining material involved being   outside the licensing system - we can only secure the halting of this work byDecca and in particular the withdrawal of their technicians,with their agreement.   This plainly would not be forthcomingwithout a guarantee by us to compensate them for the losssustained and any damages awarded against them to the indonesian Government.(d) That such compensation might particularly in the context of(b) above constitute some measure of commitment to compensate the other British commercial interests inIndonesia if as is possible in any event they areexpropriated.3.       Nonetheless the Committee, though not without hesitation,was predominantly of the view that the time had now come to take all steps open to us to stop work on the radar chain.   Their main reason was that it would be impossible to defend to Parliament, ourNATO allies, and members of our own Forces in the Far Eastcontinuation of work by a British firm and British technicians whichwas plainly strengthening the military position of Indonesia.   this feeling was accentuated by the further information that although thereare only now some 19 Decca technicians in Indonesia the number is planned to increase to 60 during the next two years.-1-
They felt however that this would only be possible if linked with a decision to announce the embargo on arms exports generallywhich has in practice been in effect for some weeks.4.       The Minister of Defence has a Question to answer fromMr. Denis Healey on Wednesday, 11th December., on this subject.Although it may be possible to persuade Mr. Kealey to postpone thisif he can be assured that action is being taken and that too early anannouncement might make it more difficult to get the Deccatechnicians out, it is clearly important that a firm decision shouldbe taken before Y/wednesday.   I would therefore suggest that you should authorise me to report orally to the Cabinet which I under standyou are in any event arranging for Monday afternoon.5.       If the Cabinet decides in principle that this is the right line,it will be necessary for the Ministry of Aviation to get in touchquickly with Decea Limited, to give them assurances on compensation which can be agreed with the Treasury, and to ask them to withdraw their technicians as quickly as possible.   Meanwhile the ForeignOffice is seeking to ascertain from our Embassy at Djakarta what steps will be necessary for the speedy evacuation of these techniciansif the Cabinet v/ex-e so to decide.I am sending a copy of this minute to the Minister of defence and to the members of the Strategic Exports Committee,(Signed)  JOHN EC YD-CARPENTER.6th December, 1963-2-
