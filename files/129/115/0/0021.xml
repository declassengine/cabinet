Printed for the Cabinet. November 1963CP. (63) 21 Copy No. 5 \26th November, 1963CABINETA NEW BUILDING AGENCYMemorandum by the Minister of Public Building and works at the invitation of the Economic Policy Committee on 22nd November(E.P. (63) 5th Meeting, item 4) I am circulating to the Cabinet the attached revised draft of a White Paper proposing the establishment of a National Building Agency.Why the Agency is needed2. This Agency is urgently needed if the construction industries are to achieve the striking increase in productivity required to carry out the massive building programmes already announced as part of our policy of modernising Britain.3. Our problem is to increase output by more than 50 per cent in the next decade without any great increase in the demand on the country&apos;s limited labourresources. The solution lies in greater industrialisation of building and everything possible must be done to expedite this. Progress is being hampered mainly by twoobstacles. First there is not enough continuity of demand. Secondly we are not making the best use of the available fund of specialised and technical expertise.The functions, status and size of the Agency4. The proposed Agency would help both public and private clients bycollating building requirements into phased programmes so that the newer methodsof building would be more readily available to them. It would place at the disposalof clients, contractors, and components manufacturers a pool of expert and up-to-date knowledge about industrialised methods, and would assist in trainingmembers of the industry and professions in the use of these methods. It couldoccasionally execute commissions to provide a full architectural service, but thiswould be the exception rather than the rule.5. I propose that the Agency should be a company, limited by guarantee.I also propose that, after consultation with the local authority associations, therepresentative bodies in the building industry, the associated professions and thelocal authority building consortia, I should appoint a Chairman, managing director and a Board of Directors.6. I envisage the Agency as comparatively small, but high powered. It wouldbe essential to have as Managing Director a man of high calibre. One would therefore have to be willing to pay him a high salary, and similarly to pay salaries for other staff which would attract the right men. I envisage that initially the agency&apos;s budget might be of the order of  250,000 rising perhaps to  500,000.As the Agency developed it would be expected to obtain part of its income throughfees charged for the services which it provided. It would, however, be unlikelyever to become fully self-supporting. I believe that we can readily justify such a continuing subsidy. The total value of public investment in new construction inGreat Britain in the current financial year will be about  1,275 million, of whichat least  700 million will be building, as opposed to civil engineering, work. 800 million will be spent on construction for local government services, of which by far the greater part will be building. The potential savings to be achieved through the work of the Agency are enormous and most of them would arise in building operations wholly or partly financed by the Government.3539THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
Legislation7. I am advised by the Treasury Solicitor that legislation is not legallynecessary to empower me to set up a Central Building Agency. As, however,continuing expenditure of public funds is likely to be involved and as the Agencymight be held to represent a new departure in Government policy so far as thebuilding industry was concerned, it would probably be in accordance with the1 understanding . between the Treasury and the Public Accounts Committee tointroduce legislation at a convenient opportunity after the Agency had beenestablished. Such legislation need do no more than authorise the payment out of moneys provided by Parliament of sums required by the Minister of public building and Works to meet the necessary continuing expenditure.Consultations with interested bodies8. My wide informal consultations with leading representatives of thebuilding industry, the architectural profession and local government have shownthat there would be considerable support for an Agency of this nature. Beforethe actual publication of the White Paper it would, however, be appropriate tohave formal consultations which in the circumstances I would hope to carry outquickly.conclusion.  I ask for agreement that:(1) A National Building Agency should be established on the basis set outin paragraphs 4-6 above and in the draft White Paper.(2) I should now formally consult the construction industries, the associatedprofessions and the local authority associations with a view topublishing the White Paper at a very early date.G. R.Lambeth Bridge House, S.E. 1,25th November, 1963.
CONFMTIALREVISED   DRAFT   WHITE    PAPERA NATIONAL BUILDING AGENCYThere  is an ever  increasing demand  for building,   for both  social  and economic purposes.In  the next   ten yearswe must  build millions  of  houses,   many universities   and colleges,   schools,   hospitals and other public buildings.We must  also  invest on a  large  scale  in new  factories,all   these needs  the output   of  the  building   industry mustincrease by more than  50 per cent,   in  the next  decade.This  will have  to be done without  any great   increase   in thedemand on   the ntt ion1s   limited   labour resources.2.       Since  the war   the building  industry has achievednotable  increases   in productivity.      But   if  it   is   to cope with  the upsurge of demand now  facing  it  the  industry willhave  rapidly to  increase  the  industrialisation of  itsmethods.       In other words   the   industry must   introduce moremechanisation and make greater use  of  factory made componentsin order  to achieve  faster  construction and to reduce  theamount  of  skilled  labour used on building sites.      Thisindu s t r i a. 1 i sa t i on of building presents  special problems.The  two obstacles which chiefly impede  its  growth are  the lack of an assured and well organised demand and the   limitedknowledge and experience of new techniques.roads,   power  stations  and port   insta1 lat ions.To meet
Co-ordination of Demand3.In the  co-ordination of demand  the building  industry-is dependent upon help  from the clients  for whom it works.It needs   to be assured of orders which are  large  enough,and provide  sufficient continuity of  demand,   to  justifyinvestment  on a  large  enough scale   for  industrialisation.Of the  total  investment   in new construction more  than half is  for public authorities.      A special responsibility thusrests on public clients  to organise   their building demandsinto  large contracts  planned as   far ahead as  possible.       Ifthey discharge  this responsibility adequately  they will themselves be the  chief beneficiaries:     their  buildings willbe completed in  time  and at  costs which are not   inflated by labour  shortages.4.      Notable progress has  already been made  in organisingdemand  through  the establishment of consortia of  localauthorities.      Housing  is  the  field  in which the need, andthe  opportunity,  are  greatest.       There are almost   1,450local housing authorities   in England and Wales.      With the encouragement of  the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment  two  consortia of  large   local housing authoritieshave already been  set up  in Yorkshire and  the Midlands,   threeothers  are  being developed in the north-west  and elsewherethere are   five  informal  groupings preliminary  to  theformation of consortia.      Although  some   smaller authorities may  later  join  the consortia this kind of co-operation is best  suited to   the  circumstances of  the   large  authorities with major programmes  to pool and with highly qualifiedprofessional  staffs.      Of all  the housing authorities  in/England2...
England and Wales only 205 build more  than  100 houses ayear.      The  remaining  1,245 authorities at  present account for 30,000 houses  a year,  or about 30 per cent,  of  thetotal of all  local  authority house building.      There  is an urgent need to   find a way of helping  these authorities  togroup their requirements  together.5.      Local authorities  in England and Wales  also placecontracts   for a  great  variety of  buildings other  thanhouses,   costing about   175 million a year.About    125 million of this   is spent on educational  building.      With  the  encouragement ofthe Ministry of Education  five building consortiahave already been established,  of which 35  localeducation authorities,  responsible  for about45 per cent,  of  the  total  school  building programme,   are members.      Membership of  theseconsortia  is growing rapidly and  the Ministry ofEducation provides an agency whereby consortiasystems may be used  for  individual projects orlimited programmes.       It   is  intended to expandand develop these arrangements as quickly aspossible,   and  the extent   (if any)   to which new arrangements may be needed  in relation to  schooland college building will  be considered  later  inthe  light  of  the  development  of  the  consortia.The remaining  50 million  is  spent  onmiscellaneous  buildings;     there are  industrialisedbuilding systems,  methods  or components whichcould be used  in  the construction of most of  them if,  but  only if,   the orders   for  them werecombined into programmes.3 .
6.       In Scotland there   is a  similar need  to organise  localauthority demand.      There are 232  local  housing authorities,,With  the  encouragement  of  the Secretary of State,   16 ofthese authorities,   together with  the   four New TownCorporations  and  the Scottish Special Housing Association,have  formed a consortium  for housing.      However,  30 percent,  of  the whole Scottish  local  authority housing programme  remains outside  the ambit  of  this  consortium.In addition Scottish  local authorities  spend about 25 million each year on other new building work,   including 17 million on school building:     there are 35 educationauthorities,  of which  two are members  of a buildingconsortium.       There  is  thus  considerable scope  for  furtherco-ordination of  local  authority building requirements  inScot land.7.      The position of the private client  is even moredifficult.      Private building owners  collectivelycommission half of  the   industry&apos;s output,   yet   they are almostprecluded   from deriving advantage  from industrialisedbuilding because  they cannot   themselves offer continuousprogrammes nor  can  they join consortia.      The  exceptionsare  few -   for example,   where a private client  can place a very  large  contract   for a multi-storey office  building,  aprivate housing development or a major  industrial project.In  the  private  sector  there   is  an even greater need   for an organisation which would offer building clients   theopportunity of pooling  their requirements   together.
Pro fes s ional^and Technical Assistance8.      Most  clients,  public and private,  also need help  inthe   choice and use  of   industrialised building methods.Those   local  authorities  which  lack whole-time highlyqualified professional  staffs  cannot  be expected  to evaluate and employ the new methods unless  they have access to expert  objective advice.      Private  clients,  and theirprofessional advisers,   share  this need  for help  in makinginformed  judgements about  the suitability of particularindustrialised systems or methods  for  their ov/n require-ments.       Because  the  industrialisation of building has developed so quickly  in recent years  there  is a  shortage of up-to-date knowledge about  its  techniques  and possibilities.A new source of  independent advice  drawn  from the  availablepool of specialised professional  expertise appears  to beessent ia other Needs9.       If rapid progress  is  to  be made with  the   industrialis-ation of  building more  training  in  the application of new techniques   is another necessity.       The  great  majority ofmembers  of  the  building professions  are not yet   fullyconversant with industrialised building.      Buildingcontractors who are developing  industrialised methods mightwelcome  additional  specialised training  facilities  for theirsenior staffs.      Any arrangements  to meet   this demand mustbe devised  in consultation with the professionalinstitutions and educational  bodies  concerned,   and operated in conjunction with  them.5.
CONFIDENTIAL ,        - Qlo10.      Building  contractors who are developing proprietarysystems have  their own resources,  but  some of them wouldprobably welcome assistance  from a staff qualified toadvise on the  latest   technical advances.      Many componentmanufacturers are also  lihely  to  welcome advice   from thosethoroughly  familiar with the   latest methods  so  that  theymay be better able  to  develop new materials  and components.Meetijig^Jbhese Needs11.       The Government  have  been examining possible ways  of meeting these needs   in order  to  ensure  that   industria1is-ation of  building may proceed at   the  necessary pace.       Inthe  light  of  this  examinat ion, a.nd of discussions with thebuilding  industry and  its  clients,   they have concluded  thatthe right  course  is  to  establish a National  Building Agency.This Agency,  which will  be  independent of direct government control but will receive a grant - in-a id,  will  offer  itsservices  to all building clients,  public and private:    nocompulsion will  be  exercised  to direct  authorities  to use the Agency&apos;s  services.12. The services which the proposed Agency will provide areas  fo1 lows:(i)    To assist  clients,  both public and private,   topool   their building requirements  together,  andcollate  them  into phased programmes.      Theresponsibility  for   the  contracts and thecontrol of  their  execution will  remain withthe c 1 ien t s .6.
(ii)    To advise  these clients  on the administrativeprocedures and  the  professional  services whichthey need  in order  to use  the newer methodsof building and  to offer a range of professional  services  to the clients accordingto  the  circumstances.      A  full  design and planning  service would be  provided onlyexceptionally.(iii)    To advise  the  clients and  their professionaladvisers  on particular methods of buildingwhich might  satisfy their needs  and on  the procedures  for  design,   contract  arrangements and administrative control  appropriate to  them.(iv)    To make available  existing systems  of buildingcontrolled by  local authority consortia toclients who do not belong  to  the  consortia,(v)     In relation to  systems of building which arecommercially controlled  to help clients andtheir  professional advisers  to arrange   soundworking relationships with  the   firms   whichcontrol  them.(vi)    To encourage educational  bodies  and other organisations     (including any  industrial training Board    set up for  the construction industries)   to provide more extensivetraining  facilities  in  the  new techniques ofbuilding  for members of  the professions andthe  staffs of  building   contractors andcomponent manufacturers;     and to  collaboratein providing  these  facilities.7.
(vii)    To advise building contractors  and componentmanufacturers,   as required,   on  thedevelopment  of   systems of building and components.(viii)    To assist clients who are using  traditionalmethods of building to order   their materials and components   in bulk where  they are agreed on common specifications.Or gani sat ion of  the Agency13.      The Building Agency will be a partnership between theGovernment,  which is  the building  indus try1s  largest  singleclient,   other clients  - both public  and private,   and  theindustry in its widest sense.       It v/ill not be part  of  aGovernment Department  or  subject  to detailed control by a.Minister:    but  its  status will be  that  of   a public agencyenjoying a  large measure  of   independence.14.      The  intention is  that  the Agency  should take  the  formof  a company limited by guarantee.       Its  governing body willbe a board of  directors  appointed by  the Minister  of public building and Works,   after consultation with  the  localauthority associations,   the representative bodies   in  thebuilding industry,   the associated professions  and  the  localauthority building consortia.      The board will   includeappropriate Scottish representation.15.      The Minister will  also appoint   the managing director,v/ho will be offered remuneration to attract  a man of  highcalibre.       To support   the managing director  adequately a highly qualified staff will be needed,  drawn from the professions  of  architect,   engineer,   surveyor  and accountant,and including also general  administrators.       It  is   important that  the Agency sho-ald not  seek  to staff  itself  on a scale which would seriously deprive other bodies,   local   authorities,etc.,   of  numbers   of   their key staff.       It might be possible/ to.
to  introduce a system under which staff  could betransferred to the Agency for  a  limited period,subsequently resuming  their normal work.       In this wayincreasing numbers  of professional  officers could gainexpert knowledge  of   the new techniques,  and.  the  staff ofthe Agency could be kept  in touch with  the problems  ofclients:     this would provide a  valuable cross-ferti1isationof  ideas.16.       The Agency will be financed  initially by a Grant-in-Aid  from the Exchequer.      As  its  activities develop  it willbe expected to obtain part of   its   income  through feescharged for  the  services which  it provides.17.       The Agency will  have close relations with  the directorate General  of Research and Development  in theMinistry of Public Building and Works.       Its  operationswill also bring it  into regular contact with  the  developmentgroups   in the other building departments  of Government,with consortia of   local  authorities  and with public  and private building  owners.      Collaboration with  the relevantprofessional  institutions&apos;,   trade bodies and educationalagencies will be  essential;     and  international contactswill  be developed  to secure  the benefit of  foreignexperience of  industrialised building.18.       The Agency&apos;s offices will be  located with thesecontacts  in mind.       It will  require a central  office,probably in London,   and another  in Scotland.       The aim is  todevelop other offices  in various parts  of   the country so asto maintain closer contact with local authorities  and otherclient  organisations.9.
CONFIDENTIAL

CONCLUSION

19. The Government are satisfied that an Agency established in accordance with these general proposals has an essential part to play in enabling the urgent national need for more and quicker building to be met. It will provide a service open to all who wish to use it and will be ready to help all those engaged in building to carry out their plans more easily and expeditiously.
