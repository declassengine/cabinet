confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1963CP. (63) 20 Copy No.  g 122nd November, 1963CABINETTHE GOVERNMENTS POLICIES AND PLANSNote by the Prime minister am grateful to all my colleagues for the replies which they have sent to myenquiry about the major problems confronting the Government during the nextfew months. I have studied these replies with great interest and with two thoughtsuppermost in my mind:(a) Our plans for reform and modernisation must be matched by financialand fiscal responsibility. If we cannot manifestly ensure this, we haveno effective answer to our opponents&apos; attempts to outbid us. any proposals for action will therefore have to be judged in relation to thesharp increase in public expenditure and public investment which isnow taking place and to the rising tide of economic activity which,some time next year, will reach the point when the growing demands on our resources will catch up the less rapidly expanding supply. in short, we shall soon reach the position where all our resources are fully committed; and that will mean that, thereafter, we should onlybe able to increase the share of those resources devoted to public expenditure by reducing the share taken by private expenditure, i.e., by increased taxation. Nobody wants this. We must therefore plan on thebasis of a system of priorities, which ensures that any proposals for additional expenditure are examined in relation to the growth of publicCONFIDENTIAL
expenditure as a whole. These considerations make it particularlyincumbent upon Ministers to observe the rule that proposals involvingexpenditure should not be brought before the Cabinet, or its committees, without prior discussion with the Treasury.(b) It is equally important, however, that, provided that we remain within thelimits prescribed by a sense of economic responsibility, our policiesshould be, and should be seen to be, positive and constructive. Thisrequires us to identify the points where decisions need to be taken;to take the necessary decisions; to present them as attractively andimaginatively as we can; and to stick to them. I have tried to take thefirst step in this direction by sending minutes to individual ministers on the topics which seem to me to need special attention or addedeffort; and I hope that during the next few weeks these questions willbe brought forward, through the normal committee machinery, and willbe dealt with as promptly as possible. I shall rely on all Ministers tocontinue to keep their departmental programmes under close review in order to maintain the momentum of a positive and forward-lookingpolicy.A. D.-H.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,22nd November, 1963.CONFIDENTIAL
