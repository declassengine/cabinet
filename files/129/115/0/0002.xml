CONFIDENTIAL &quot; iTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1963CP. (63) 2 Copy No.     5 122nd October, 1963CABINETCIVIL PUBLIC INVESTMENT: WHITE PAPER, 1963Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster General.We are under an obligation, following the precedents of the last three years,to publish a White Paper on public investment at the beginning of the new sessionof Parliament, with a view to a day&apos;s debate before Christmas. The accompanyingdraft has been prepared after consultation with the Departments concerned.2. As for last year, the draft is in two parts: Part I dealing in general terms with civil public investment as a whole, and Part II giving factual notes on theindividual programmes. Part I is mainly devoted to an analysis of developments and an explanation of the Government^ decisions in the field of public investmentsince the 1962 White Paper (Cmnd. 1849). It makes clear our willingness to permit a further significant increase in public investment in 1964-65, although in view of thefact that resources are likely to be more fully employed in 1964-65, the rate of increase over 1963-64 7 per cent overall is less than that for 1963-64 over1962-63-20 per cent.3.  The attached draft has, in addition, three new features:(i) a resume of our progress in implementing the policy, outlined in the 1961White Paper on the Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 1337), of ensuring as far as possible thatthe nationalised industries secure a proper rate of return on the capital invested in them (Part I, paragraph 13);(ii) an Appendix setting out public investment expenditure (actual and prospective) over the ten years from 1955-56 to 1964-65;(iii) an Appendix (Appendix I) summarising public investment expenditureon facilities for sport and physical recreation, which has been includedin accordance with the undertaking by the Lord President of theCouncil to the House of Lords in the debate on sport on 22nd May,1963 (Appendix II).4. The draft White Paper takes account, so far as public service investment is concerned, of the discussion at the Economic Policy Committee in July thisyear (E.A. (63) 35th Meeting, Item 2); the figures take account of the additionalinvestment approved for North-East England and Central Scotland(E.A. (63) 39th Meeting, Item 2). The figures for the nationalised industries arealso based on decisions reached in the course of the year.3339CONFIDENTIAL

PART ONEPublic Investment 1961/1965Total Expenditure 19611651. Public investment continues to increase very rapidly. The total figure is expected to grow from  1,795 million in 1961/62 to 2,500 million in1964/65. At constant prices, this is an increase of nearly 35 per centin three years.2. Total expenditure on public investment is normally considered under two heads: that of the nationalised industries and public corporations; and investment expenditure by the central Government and local authorities,referred to as public service investment. The major increases in nationalised industries&apos; investment are in expenditure on electricity and Post office services. All the major public service programmes show increases in thefigures, proportionately the largest being on roads, hospitals and local health and welfare services, the aggregate of small local authority programmes, andthe smaller central Government programmes.

The outturn of expenditure in 1961/62 ( 1,795 million) was slightly higher than the estimate given in last year&apos;s White Paper, &quot; Public Invest-ment in Great Britain, October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849)&quot; ( 1,790 million). Thepresent estimate of outturn in 1962/63 is, however, some 3 per cent lessat constant prices ( 60 million at the prices of the 1963 Review) than theestimate given in Cmnd. 1849. The trend of expenditure in the first half of 1962/63 suggested that the outturn forecast for that year in cmnd. 1849 would in fact be reached if not exceeded.  In the event the
unusually severe winter adversely affected progress on construction pro-grammes and plainly had a good deal to do with the lower estimateof outturn now given.5. The following table compares the latest estimates of expenditure for 1962/63, and also for 1963/64 (see paragraphs 6-9 below), with those given in Cmnd. 1849.	1962/63 Estimated out-turn			1963/64 Estimated expenditure			Nation-nationalised Industries	Public Service	Total	Nation-nationalised Industries	Public Service	TotalAt piices of 1962 Review (&apos;) 1962 Review (Cmnd. 1849) At prices of 1963 Review (2) 1963 Review At prices of 1963 Review (2)	930 945	1,000 1,030	1,930 1,975	965 985	1,095 1,150	2,060 2,135	Est	mated out-turn		Estimated out-t		urn	920	995	1,915	1,135	1,200	2,335(&apos;) March, 1962 prices.(2) Actual prices for 1962/63; Maxh, 1963 prices for 1963/64.Outturn of Expenditure in 1963/646. Total public investment expenditure in 1963/64 is now expected to be 2,335 million or  200 million more than the estimate shown in Cmnd.1849 adjusted to the prices of the 1963 Review. Nationalised industries&apos;investment accounts for  150 million of the increase and public service investment for the remaining  50 million.7. Last year&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd. 1849) made it clear that the estimated expenditure for nationalised industries&apos; investment in 1963/64 made no allowance for proposals for additional investment in electricity whichwere then under consideration. It was thought that these proposals might involve an extra  70 million of investment; but this figure has since been increased to take account of the continuing upward trend in the demandfor electricity. Extra electricity investment now accounts for  135 million of the increase of  150 for nationalised industries. In addition, the latest estimates of demand for gas and certain Post Office services have required further increases in investment expenditure over those shown in last year&apos;white Paper.8. As last year&apos;s White Paper explained, the Government decided thatthe state of the scenery justified the approval of additional public service investment projects to start in 1962/63 and continue throughout 1963/64,this extra expenditure being undertaken so far as practicable in areas where pressure on resources was least. Towards the end of 1962 it became apparent that in certain areas (North-East England, Merseyside and partsof Scotland) further, mainly short-term, public investment expenditure would be justified to maintain the level of activity in the construction industries and to improve the basic facilities of these areas.   Local
authorities were therefore encouraged to carry out additional schemes which could be started by the end of March, 1963, and finished by theend of September, 1963. Similar arrangements applied to GovernmentDepartments and Regional Hospital Boards. Nationalised industries were also invited to bring forward suitable schemes in these areas. In some measure the efforts to provide early additional employment in construction(were frustrated by the winter weather, but the bulk of the extra work had in fact started before the end of March. Furthermore, the Govern-ment authorised a number of medium-term projects, principally extraroad works, in these areas, including the Tay Bridge. All these additionsaccount for about  10 million of the increase in the estimate of publicservice investment expenditure in 1963/64. The remaining  40 million of the increase is attributable partly to the carry-over of work from1962/63 and partly to changed requirements and higher specifications.9. On the basis of the latest estimates, total public investment expendi-ture in 1963/64 will be about 20 per cent, higher at constant pricesthan the level of 1962/63. Nationalised industries&apos; investment is shownas increasing by about 21 per cent and public service investment byabout 18 per cent. These are unprecedented rates of increase and, whilethe Governments view is that the resources should be available in theperiod to meet such an expansion, there must be some doubt whether inpractice the intentions of public authorities can be translated into work done quite as quickly as these figures imply. The prospects are, more-over, obscured by the disruption of construction activity for some monthsduring the winter and the backlog of work which resulted. It may be,therefore, that some of the work authorised for 1963/64 will in the event be felt as a call on resources in 1964/65. This is a factor to be takeninto account in determining investment programmes for 1964/65.Estimated Expenditure in 1964/6510. The Government consider that, although the growth of the economy and the development of the public services call for a continuing high rate ofpublic investment expenditure, the increase in expenditure in 1964/65 mustbe less than in 1963/64. Apart from the possibility, referred to in paragraph above, that some of the rising pressure of public investment expenditure in1963/64 will be carried forward, it is expected that private investment expen-diture will begin to grow in the near future. In these circumstances, theprospect for 1964 is one of increasing pressure of demand. In particular, itis expected that the construction industries will be very heavily loaded, sincethe measures which have been taken to increase the industries&apos; output more rapidly, such as extending the use of industrialised building techniques andtraining extra craftsmen, cannot produce significant results before the end ofthe period.11. Nationalised industries&apos; investment is expected to be some 8 per centgreater in 1964/65 than in the current year. Large increases are againexpected in expenditure on electricity and Post Office investment, reflectingthe continued forecast growth in demand for these services which arises inpart from the growth of the economy as a whole. These increases are partiallyoffset by lower levels of spending on investment in the coal and gas industries.12. For public service investment the total of expenditure envisaged is per cent greater than that estimated for 1963/64.  Most programmes share7
in this increase but there are particularly marked increases in expenditure onuniversities, roads and local authorities&apos; general investment.Return on investment in Nationalised Industries13. The Government^ White Paper on the Financial and EconomicObligations of the Nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 1337), which was published in April, 1961, showed that the rates of return previously secured by these industries on the capital invested in them had for various reasons been low.There were reasons of social and economic policy why rates of returncomparable to the general level of earnings of private industry should not beexpected of the nationalised industries. Nevertheless the White Paper stressed the importance for the economy as a whole of these industries achieving ahigher level of financial performance than in the past. Since the publicationof Cmnd. 1337 financial objectives (usually for a five-year period) have beenagreed with the major nationalised fuel industries, British European Airways,the Post Office and the London Transport Board. The objectives so farannounced differ from case to case, but in general provide for a return onnet assets of between 6 per cent and 8 per cent after depreciation. It isintended that eventually objectives for financial performance should be agreed with all the nationalised industries. Improved financial performance reflects abetter use of the national resources invested in these industries and will be both a significant contribution to national economic growth and a justification of the high and increasing level of investment required by the industries,details of which are given in Part II of this White Paper.Development Plans for North-East England and Central Scotland14. The implications for public service investment of the Government^plans for developing North-East England and Central Scotland are set outin the recent White Papers describing these plans (Cmnd. and       ).The figures for 1963/64 and 1964/65 shown in this White Paper include the extra investment which has been approved as part of the policies for thesetwo areas.Winter Employment in Development Districts15. The arrangements for local authorities, Regional Hospital Boards and government Departments to undertake additional short-term works as a means of helping to maintain the level of activity in the construction industries(paragraph 8 above) have been continued for the coming winter in North-east england, Merseyside and Scotland and extended to Development Districtselsewhere in Great Britain. The arrangements apply to work which can be finished by the end of March, 1964 so that it will not add to the heavy loadwhich is expected to fall on the construction industries next summer. It is too early to say just how much extra short-term work will be undertaken;expenditure on this work will be additional to the figures shown in this white paper.Public Investment 1955-6516. Public investment expenditure on the major programmes over theyears 1955/56 to 1964/65 is shown in Appendix I. Expenditure on bothnationalised industries&apos; investment and public service investment is expectedvirtually to double in money terms over the period ; this is an increase ofsome 75 per cent in real terms for nationalised industries&apos; investment and about 55 per cent for public service investment.

Investment by the National Coal Board mainly comprises expendi-ture for promoting efficiency (e.g., face mechanisation and workshops),for maintaining existing profitable capacity, and for completing schemesfor new deep-mined capacity, for processing coal, for houses and otherancillary operations as well as for replacing plant no longer useful or economic.18. In 1962 a 7-8 per cent increase in productivity was achieved 7 million additional tons were produced with nearly 20,000 fewer men. TheNational Coal Board made a profit after five successive years of losses,and in the financial year 1962/63 repaid to the Exchequer  25 million of capital advances.19. Productivity is continuing to increase at a high rats as a resultof the replacement of obsolete machines and improvements in machineutilisation and efficiency. The percentage of output obtained by mechanisedmethods rose to 62-5 per cent in December, 1962, compared with 53-5per cent a year earlier. As the reconstruction of the industry proceeds,annual investment in colliery major capital projects (costing over  250,000)is declining, as the following table shows:  Year Expenditure  million1959...............      62-71960         ...............      48-11961 ...............      47-21962         ...............      38-6Expenditure on minor projects (mostly for cost saving or the maintenanceof profitable capacity) is tending to increase but, as the consequence ofthe diminution in expenditure on major projects, total expenditure, whichis expected to be  86 million in 1963/64 (including additional expenditureof  1 million in areas of unemployment) will be reduced to an estimated 77 million in 1964/65.
20. By the end of 1962 the Board had spent  466 million on capital account on major colliery schemes. Of this sum, about  217 million is accounted for by expenditure on 206 major schemes substantially completed at the end of 1962 and  249 million on 98 schemes continuing. Of the11 major schemes approved in 1962, 8 related to collieries and 3 to ancillaryactivities. It is expected that the proportion of coal produced from new and reconstructed pits will rise from 59 per cent in 1962 to 75 per centin 1966. The proportion of coal obtained by mechanised methods was59 per cent in 1962: in the light of recent progress it is likely that the previously quoted figure of 80 per cent by 1966 will be substantiallyexceeded.The following table analyses expenditure by type of activity:    million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65Colleries and associated activities   ......	83-6	75-8	74-0	63-0Coke ovens and manufactured fuel plants ...	2-3	0-9	2-5	4-5Ancillary activities    ............	7-4	6-8	9-5	9-5Total         ......	93-3	83-5	860	77-021. Since 1st January, 1963, all the Board&apos;s carbonisation and coalprocessing activities have been under the control of a central CoalProducts Division. Expenditure on these activities is therefore shown under one heading. Expenditure on coke ovens is confined to essentialreplacements and improvements. Expenditure on manufactured fuel plantsincludes provision for the production of smokeless briquettes, on which the design work is now reaching an advanced stage.

Investment by the gas industry in Great Britain comprises expendi-ture by the twelve Gas Boards on gas manufacture and distribution, andby the Gas Council on research (included under the heading of &quot; Other &quot;expenditure in the table above).24. Total investment by the industry in 1962/63 was  59-2 million,compared with  56-0 million estimated in October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849).This slightly higher investment arose from the acceleration of essentialprojects.25. In the past year there have been major developments affecting the gas industry. In the first place, the Boards now expect a cumulativeincrease in gas demand of over 3 per cent a year, compared with an annual increase of about l\ per cent forecast last year. A substantial increasein new gas-making capacity is therefore called for. Secondly, experienceof last winter&apos;s conditions has demonstrated the urgent need to provide additional storage capacity for raw materials and to strengthen distributionsystems. Thirdly, the development of new and low cost gas-makingprocesses based on petroleum products and natural gas promises toincrease the efficiency of manufacturing techniques and thereby improve the industry&apos;s competitive position. The Boards are therefore planning to install new plant based on these more efficient processes.26. For these reasons investment by the industry in 1963/64, which ayear ago was estimated at  64-0 million, is&apos; now expected to amount to 86-3 million. Of this additional expenditure about  9 million will be incurred in the areas of high unemployment. The need for higher invest-ment in 1963/64 to take account of increased estimates of the futuredemand for gas was foreshadowed in the March, 1963, White Paper on government Expenditure Below the Line, 1963-64 (Cmnd. 1983).27. In 1964/65 investment is expected to fall to  72 million, by which time most of the urgent measures referred to above will have been com-pleted as will the bulk of the investment in the marine terminal anddistribution pipeline required for the importation of liquefied natural gas.

Investment by the electricity supply industry in England andWales comprises expenditure by the Central Electricity Generating Boardon generating stations and the main transmission system, and by the twelve Area Boards on local distribution.29. In March, 1963, the Government asked the industry to base itsforecasts of the rate at which electricity demand would grow on theassumption that the economy would grow at the rate of 4 per cent a year.The industry&apos;s 1963 forecasts of demand show an increase over their 1962forecasts, and reflect the new assumptions about the growth of the economy.The capital investment programmes have been revised accordingly.30. At 31st March, 1963, the total output capacity of the GeneratingBoard&apos;s power stations was 31,687 MW. It is expected that some 19,500MW of new generating plant will be commissioned in the years 1963 to1967 inclusive. On present estimates a rate of commissioning of about,000 MW a year will be required in the last years of the decade to keep pace with the growing demand ; and this, together with the associated trans-mission work required, is reflected in the Generating Board&apos;s investment programme.31. Total investment in fixed assets by the Generating and Area boards in 1962/63 was  16-2 million (or about 4-5 per cent) more than was estimated in October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849). Of this  10-8 million was required by the Generating Board for generation and transmission and 5-4 million by Area Boards for distribution. Expenditure on initialcharges of nuclear fuel was  10-5 million. This was  5-5 million less thanforecast by the Generating Board. The additional expenditure on fixed assets was foreseen in the March, 1963, White Paper &quot; government expenditure Below the Line 1963/64&quot; (Cmnd. 1983).32. Increases in the industry&apos;s capital investment programmes for1963/64 were predicted in the 1962 Public Investment White Paper. These
were included in Cmnd. 1983, but a further increase is necessary to allow for the new assumptions about the growth of demand. The GeneratingBoard are expanding their construction programme as rapidly as possibleto meet the expected increased demands for electricity. The Area Boardsare accelerating their programmes, particularly for the reinforcement of thedistribution networks. The Government specially approved  7-7 million of expenditure by the Area Boards on work which would help areas of high unemployment.33. Estimated expenditure on nuclear fuel in 1963/64 is  6 million higher than the estimate given in Cmnd. 1849, because of the reduction in1962/63 referred to in paragraph 29 above.34. [The Minister has approved total investment (including nuclearfuel) in 1963/64 of  510-5 million,  120-5 million more than the estimategiven in Cmnd.1849.] Total investment, including nuclear fuel, in 1964/65,is estimated at  597-7 million, [and the Minister, after reviewing theindustry&apos;s capital investment programmes, has approved this expenditure].South of Scotland Electricity Board  million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65Generation:				Conventional stations      .........	6-0	6-4	7-5	13-5Nuclear station     ............	12-9	9-4	2-5	 Main transmission    ............	6-5	7-1	90	9-4Distribution and other       .........	9-0	13-3	16-5	15-0Total fixed assets.........	34-4	36-2	35-5	37-9Nuclear fuel (initial charges)        ......	 	 	10 0	 &apos;Total         ......	34-4	36-2	45-5	37-9The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the South of scotland electricity Board at 31st December, 1962, was  209 million.35. Because of the continuing high rate of growth in demand for electricity in the South of Scotland, the Board has had to increase itsinvestment programme, particularly on transmission and distribution works.188 MW of output capacity were added to the Board&apos;s generating plant in1962 to bring the total to 2,007 MW at 31st December ; 188 MW will beadded in 1963 ; and a further 1,576 MW are under construction.36. The last 188 MW turbo-alternator of the Board&apos;s Kincardine coal-fired generating station is due to be commissioned this year, when the completed station will have a total output capacity of 752 MW. It isexpected that the two reactors of the nuclear power station at Hunterston(output 300 MW) will be commissioned in 1964. Work is progressingsatisfactorily on the 54 MW slurry burning station at Methil, which is due for commissioning in 1965 and 1966, and on the coal-fired station atCockenzie, East Lothian, with an output capacity of 1,152 MW providedby four turbo-alternators, one to be commissioned in 1966, two in 1967and the fourth in 1968. The installation of a 70 MW gas turbine generatorat the Board&apos;s existing power station at Dunfermline has been authorised,
and work has started on it. This generator is due for commissioning in1964. Preliminary site work should begin in the early months of 1964 onLongannet coal-fired station, at which two sets with a combined output capacity of 1,152 MW are due to be commissioned by the winter of 1969,to be followed by one 576 MW set in each of the two succeeding years.37. The substantial increases in investment on main transmission anddistribution are due to the. exceptional increases in load growth which havecompelled the Board to accelerate many transmission schemes (mainly on the 275 kV supergrid) and to strengthen existing distribution networks.38. Estimated expenditure on initial nuclear fuel in 1963/64 is  3 million higher than the estimate given in Cmnd. 1849, as the whole cost isnow expected to fall in that year instead of partly in 1964/65.North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board  million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65Generation    ...............	8-6	10-0	11-6	9-9Main transmission    ...      .........	1-6	1 -9	1-8	2-6Distribution   ......      .........	3-3	3-4	4-5	5-0Total   ............	13-5	15-3	17-9	17-5The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the North of ScotlandHydro-Electric Board at 31st December, 1962, was  212 million.39. The North of Scotland has continued to experience a high rate of growth in demand, and the Board&apos;s generation and main transmission invest-ment programme is planned to keep pace with this and at the same timeto give supplies to the South Board. 73 MW of hydro capacity were addedto the Board&apos;s generating plant in 1962 to bring the total installed capacity to 1,134 MW at 31st December, 89 MW of hydro plant will be commissionedin 1963 and a further 628 MW of plant (400 MW of pumped storage and228 MW of steam plant) are under construction.40. All of the conventional hydro stations at present under construction,i.e. two in Strathfarrar and Kilmorack Scheme (48 MW), two in theAwe Scheme (40 MW), and small compensation water sets, will be corn-missioned this year. Work has been speeded up on the Cruachan pumpedstorage station, where three of the 100 MW sets are expected to be com-missioned in 1965 and the fourth in 1966. Good progress has been madeon the installation of the two 114 MW oil-fired sets at Dundee power station ; the first is planned for commissioning in 1965 and the second in1966,41. Accelerated investment on main transmission and distribution isrequired for system reinforcement to carry the increased demand. [In1964/65 provision has also been made for additional expenditure forming part of the Board&apos;s six year rural development programme for acceleratingthe present rate at which consumers in the more remote areas can be givensupplies.]

The capital investment programmes of the Air Corporations arefounded on their plans for replacing or expanding their fleets of aircraft.There may be an interval of five or six years between discussions withmanufacturers leading to orders for a new aircraft type and its coming into service. During this interval the Corporations make periodical payments to the manufacturers for aircraft under construction. Both B.O.A.C. and b.E.A. are investing capital in this way on their next generation of aircraft.Fluctuations in their expenditure from year to year reflect the phasing ofthe payment plans agreed with the manufacturers. The results of thisinvestment cannot be measured until the aircraft are brought into fulloperational service.43. Estimated expenditure by B.O.A.C. during 1963/64 and 1964/65 willbe largely progress payments on V.C.10 aircraft which will be deliveredduring 1963/64 to 1965/66. Investment in buildings, plant and equipmentincludes the development of B.O.A.C.&apos;s Headquarters at London Airport,the extension of hangar and workshop accommodation at London Airportmade necessary by the introduction of the V.C.10 and expenditure on theAirways Terminal.44. Estimated expenditure by B.E.A. during 1963/64 and 1964/65 willbe mainly progress payments on Trident aircraft. B.E.A. have 24 aircraft on order for delivery during 1963/64 to 1965/66, and are negotiating withthe manufacturer for the Trident IF aircraft, a larger version equipped with more powerful engines for B.E.A.&apos;s longer routes. The Corporation havealso ordered 2 Sikorsky S.61 helicopters for use on their operations to theStilly Isles in 1964/65. Investment in buildings, plant and equipment is mainly on the erection of the permanent West London Air Terminal atCromwell Road, and on the acquisition of plant and facilities for the new aircraft types being introduced.45. The figures for investment by B.O.A.C. in 1962/63 and 1963/64compare with estimates of  24-0 million and  33-0 million given in November,1962 (Cmnd. 1849): the figures for investment by BE.A. in these two yearscompare with estimates of  13-0 million and  17-0 million given in November,
1962 (Cmnd. 1849). The differences result largely from a re-phasing of progress payments on aircraft and a shortfall in expenditure during 1962/63on buildings, plant and equipment, partly offset by an increase in forecastexpenditure in 1963/64.British Railways Board  million	1961	1962	1963	1964Building, works and plant   .........	71-1	51-0	46-6	59-7Rolling stock:				Locomotives        ............	41-0	37-9	38-5	33-5Coaching stock     ............	18-6	12-3	5-3	6-2Freight stock        ............	14-0	12-5	4-2	4-0Collection and delivery vehicles     ......	1-2	1-6	2-0	20Ships and harbours............	2-2	1-7	2-2	3-british Transport Hotels Limited (including				railway catering services).........	1-5*	0-8*	1-0	10Research and Headquarters.........	0-3f	0-5f	1-1	0-6Total   ............	149-9	118-3	100-9	110-0The net book value of fixed assets shown in the final balance sheet of the British transport commission at 31st December, 1962, was  2,108 million.

British Railways and their associated activities were placed underthe British Railways Board from 1st January, 1963. The table shown abovegives figures for investment in railway activities for 1961 and 1962 by theBritish Transport Commission, and for later years by the British railways board.47. Investment in railway activities in 1962 was in the event less than expected in October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849). The lower final outturn reflectscontinued efforts by the Commission to curtail capital expenditure to theminimum in view of the uncertainty about the size and shape of the futurerailway system.48. These policies have been continued by the British Railways Board.The Board&apos;s Report on the Reshaping of British Railways was published inMarch, 1963. But it is likely that capital investment this year and nextwill remain at a considerably lower level than in earlier years. It will take time to complete further studies needed, such as operational and marketsurveys, and to prepare firm plans for the development of new types of services which may arise out of the Report.49. Total investment in 1963 is now estimated at  100-9 million, thatis  14-1 million below the estimate given in October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849).Investment was affected by the extremely bad weather in the early partof the year, which brought outside engineering operations to a virtualstandstill for some weeks. The considerations referred to in paragraphs45 and 46 above have of course had an influence too.50. The investment figures for 1964 have been agreed after a careful review of requirements by the Ministry of Transport in conjunction with
the British Railways Board. The largest single item of fixed works willbe investment in the London Midland Electrification Scheme which isnow well advanced. It is likely that some new projects, including schemesenvisaged in the Reshaping Report, will come forward in the course of1964. The agreed investment totals allow for this possibility. The extentto which such proposals may be approved will depend on the contributionthey are expected to make to the ultimate aim of viability of the railways.London Transport Board  million	1961	1962	1963	1964Railways       ...............	11-1	12-4	14-7	16-5Buses and coaches    ............	3-3	30	3-0	3 0Total   ............	14-4	15-4	17-7	19-5The net book value of fixed assets shown in the final balance sheet of the British transport commission at 31st December, 1962, was  2,108 million. Of this sum assets to the value ofabout  165 million were transferred to the London Transport Board with effect from 1stJanuary, 1963.51. London Transport, which was formerly administered by the london transport Executive of the British Transport Commission, was placed under the London Transport Board from 1st January, 1963. The tableabove gives figures for investment in London Transport activities by theBritish Transport Commission in 1961 and 1962 and for investment bythe London Transport Board in later years.52. The revised figure of  154 million for 1962 is greater by  0-million than the figure given in October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849). This differ-ence is mainly due to the rephasing of expenditure on railway rollingslock and partly to rises in prices.53. London Transport have three major projects in progress. Twoof these concern their railway system and the third their road services.On the railways, work on the main programme of construction of thenew tube line the Victoria line is now well under way. investment is expected to increase steadily, reaching its peak in 1967. The modernisa-tion and rehabilitation of the electric power supply system (generationand distribution) continues, and will not be completed until 1969. Onthe roads, the replacement of the old standard &quot; RT&quot; buses by Route-masters continues at a steady rate of around  2-4 million per annum.In addition, improvements are planned to premises, rolling stock andequipment.British Transport Docks Board  million	1961	1962	1963	1964Land and buildings............	3-6	4-4	2-1	4-7Plant and machinery............	1-8	0-8	2-2	2-5Vessels..................	0-8	0-7	1-0	0-9Total   ............	6-2	5-9	5-3	8-1The net book value of fixed assets shown in the final balance sheet of the British transport commission at 31st December, 1962, was  2,108 million.

54. The harbours which were formerly administered by the DocksDivision of the British Transport Commission, together with LowestoftHarbour which v/as formerly administered by British Railways, were placed under the British Transport Docks Board from 1st January, 1963. the table above gives figures for investment in these harbours by the british transport Commission in 1961 and 1962 and for investment by the DocksBoard in later years.55. Investment in 1963 is now estimated at  5-3 million, which is slightly below the estimate given in October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849). Thereduction is due to a re-examination of proposed works which is being undertaken by the Docks Board.56. The investment figures for 1964 have been agreed after careful study by the Ministry of Transport in consultation with the Docks Board.Essential renewals and replacements account for the major part of theprogramme.57. The Docks Board are continuing with the modernisation and im-provement of dock facilities. The Board are also reviewing the futureinvestment requirements of each of their harbours. Any proposals for major development will in future be referred by the Ministry of Trans-port to the newly established National Ports Council for their advice and comment (see paragraph ). It is not thought likely that this reviewwill materially affect the figures for 1964.British Waterways Board  million	1961	1962	1963	1964Buildings, and canal and dock structures ...	1-4	1-4	1-5	1-plant, machinery and equipment    ......	0-2	0-2	0-2	0-2Vehicles, ships and craft     .........	0-1	0-1	0-2	0-1Total   ............	1-7	1-7	1-9	1-7The net book value of fixed assets shown in the final balance sheet of the British transport commission at 31st December, 1962, was  2,108 million. Of this sum assets to the value ofabout  20 million were transferred to the British Waterways Board with effect from 1stJanuary, 1963.58. The British Waterways Board took over responsibility for the inland waterways of the former British Transport Commission on 1st January,1963. The table above gives figures for investment in waterways bythe British Transport Commission in 1961 and 1962 and for investment by the British Waterways Board in later years.59. In 1962, the last year under the control of the Commission, expendi-ture on the waterways was  1-7 million, as forecast in October, 1962(Cmnd. 1849). This expenditure was mainly on deferred maintenance and essential replacements, but also included work on the development of selected waterways begun in 1956.60. Total investment by the Board in 1963 is forecast at  1-9 million,which is  0-2 million below the estimate made in October, 1962 (Cmnd.1849). This reflects the Board&apos;s decision to limit expenditure to theminimum, pending decisions on future waterways policy now under con-sideration by the new Board.
61. Planned expenditure for 1964 is similarly being closely controlled.Investment is expected to be mainly on the minimum essential replace-ment of craft, plant, machinery and equipment, and on essential works of waterway maintenance required to meet the Board&apos;s statutory obliga-tions.Transport Holding Company  million	1961	1962	1963	1964British Road Services............	4-9	4-8	5-5	5-0Tilling and Scottish Omnibus Groups	5-6	5-8	. 6-4	6-5Others..................	1-0	0-5	1-2	0-3Total   ............	11-5	111	13-1	11-8The net book value of fixed assets shown in the final balance sheet of the British transport commission at 31st December, 1962, was  2,108 million. Of this sum assets to the value ofabout  88 million were transferred to the Transport Holding Company with effect from 1st January, 1963.62. The figures for 1963 and 1964 shown in the table are the first inrespect of the Transport Holding Company. This body was establishedby the Transport Act, 1962, and embraces a number of subsidiaries ofthe former British Transport Commission, namely, companies in the BritishRoad Services Group and the Tilling and Scottish Bus Groups, Thos. Cook&amp; Co. Ltd., Atlantic Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. and Associated HumberLines Ltd.63. The difference between the figures published in October, 1962(Cmnd. 1849) and those above are accounted for as follows:  (a) The outturn for 1962 is  06 million less than the figure estimatedlast year, mainly on account of a slower rate of investment in land and buildings by British Road Services and in vehicle replacementsby the Tilling and Scottish Bus Groups.(b) The forecast outturn for 1963 is  0-3 million higher than theprevious figure on account of the postponement from earlier yearsof part of the cost of a new ship for Atlantic Steam Navigation.64. As in previous years, the major portion of the investment by theroad passenger and goods undertakings is for the replacement of vehicles.The remainder of the investment is for bus stations and depot facilities.1963 should see the completion of a new ship for the Atlantic SteamNavigation Company.Atomic Energy Authority  million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65Land and buildings............

The fixed assets of the NationalInstitute for Research in Nuclear Science, valued at cost and with no allowance for deprecia-tion, amounted to  11 - 8 million at the same date.
65. In addition to investment by the Atomic Energy Authority, thefigures shown above include investment by the National Institute for research in Nuclear Science, and all capital expenditure on the EuropeanNuclear Energy Agency&apos;s experimental reactor (Dragon) at Winfrith Heath,which is financed by contributions from the Authority and member coun-tries. The Authority&apos;s share of the expenditure is financed from the atomic Energy Vote (Class VII, Vote 3).66. The major part of the Authority&apos;s investment is concerned withtheir research and development programme, the primary aim of which isto establish reactor systems capable of generating electricity as cheap as,and subsequently cheaper than, electricity generated by coal and oilburning power stations. Work has started on building a steam-generatingheavy water moderated reactor at Winfrith Heath in Dorset, designed to study the system experimentally and to prove its performance as an econo-mic power producing system. Work is also proceeding on design anddevelopment leading to a large prototype fast reactor incorporating theknowledge gained on the Dounreay experimental fast reactor.67. In the research field work is continuing on the building of the newvariable energy cyclotron. Building work is proceeding on the third phase of the Culham Laboratory, the Authority&apos;s centre for plasma physics andfusion research, the objective of which is power generation from controlledfusion reactions.68. Investment by the National Institute for Research in Nuclear Scienceincludes the 7 percent proton synchrotron (NIMROD) and associated equip-ment, to be used for fundamental nuclear physics research by universities and other bodies. The programme also includes expenditure on the pur-chase of an ATLAS digital computer for use by universities, the atomic energy Authority, Government Departments and the Institute; and onthe construction of a new laboratory in the North of England to house a4 percent electron synchrotron.Post Office  million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65Postal:				Plant and machinery	1 -0	1-0	1-3	1-9Accommodation services.........	7 0	7-4	9-3	17-2Motor transport    ............	0-9	0-9	1-4	1-8Telecommunications:				Plant, machinery and ships       ......	95-6	99-8	126-4	137-3Accommodation services.........	12-2	13-2	14-7	181Motor transport    ............	1-9	1-2	2-7	3-2Total         ......	118-6	123-5	155-8	179-5The net took value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the Post Office at 31stMarch, 1963, was  1,033 million.69. A summary of current Post Office plans was included in the white paper Post Office Prospects 1963-64 (Cmnd. 1972).   The main objectives
for the inland telecommunications services are to complete the conversionof the remaining 600 manual exchanges to automatic working by 1970, toextend subscriber trunk dialling to nearly all telephones by the same date, and to expand the inland telephone system to meet traffic growth(especially in the trunk service) and new demands for telephone service.In addition investment is required for the continuing expansion of thetelex and private telegraph services. In the overseas telecommunicationsfield the principal feature is the continued expansion of the submarinecable network to meet traffic growth and to improve service. The invest-ment in postal plant and machinery reflects the growth of mechanisationin sorting offices.70. The figures in the tables exclude Post Office Expenditure in NorthernIreland, on the provision of television links for the BBC and ITA, andin connection with road improvements works.Other Public Corporations  million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65British Broadcasting Corporation  ......	4-5	6-5	14-3	13-8Independent Television Authority......	1-8	1-3	1-1	1-9Convent Garden Market Authority	3-9		 	 Total         ......	10-2	7-8	15-4	15-771. Investment by the British Broadcasting Corporation is normallyfinanced from the Broadcasting Vote (Class XI, Vote 1). The greater partof the investment is for the Home Services, for which the amount of the vote is related to licence revenue. Provision is made for the extension andimprovment of coverage of the existing television and very high frequencysound broadcasting services, for new and improved buildings and equip-ment, and in the latter part of the period under review for a start on the developments outlined in the White Paper, Memorandum on the Report ofthe Committee on Broadcasting I960 (Cmnd. 1770).72. Investment by the Independent Television Authority is normallyfinanced from the Authority&apos;s own resources ; during the period underreview it has the object of extending coverage and improving reception.73. The figures for both the British Broadcasting Corporation and independent Television Authority include not only the capital expenditure incurred directly by them but also the capital expenditure incurred by thePost Office in providing television links which are leased to the broad-casting authorities.74. Further investment by the Covent Garden Market Authority will depend upon the Authority&apos;s choice of a site for a new market. It is nowunlikely that expenditure will be incurred before the end of 1964/65.

The table shows capital expenditure on motorways and trunk roads and on classified roads. Capital expenditure on other roads and on all forms of road lighting is included in the table of other capital expenditure by local authorities (page       ).76. The Ministry of Transport in England and Wales and the scottish development Department in Scotland are responsible for the building oftrunk roads and motorways on trunk routes ; expenditure is met entirely from Exchequer funds (Class IV, Votes 11 and 12). The local authoritiesare responsible for the building of classified roads, and expenditure is metpartly by the local authorities and partly from Exchequer grants.77. The road programme approved by the Government envisages con-tinued expansion, and it appears likely that during the five years ending1968/69, the Exchequer contribution will be of the order of  780 million in England and Wales and   million in Scotland. In addition the localauthorities will be spending approximately  115 million in England andWales and       million in Scotland.78. The road programme in England and Wales falls broadly into two parts, inter-urban and urban. Most motorways and trunk roads are inter-urban (though improvements such as by-passes not only help through traffic
out also ease congestion in the towns). The bulk of the classified road programme consists of schemes for the improvement of main roads in the conurbations and large cities (with few exceptions the main roads insideLondon and the County Boroughs are classified roads).79. The aim of the inter-urban road programme is three-fold ; first, topress ahead with the main motorway network motorways between London,Yorkshire, Lancashire, the Midlands and South Wales (about 750 miles in all); second, to modernise comprehensively (by building short motor-ways or reconstructing the all-purpose trunk road) certain important trunkroutes which provide connections to the main motorway network or coverparts of the country not served by it (e.g. the Great North Road, london to Newcastle); third, to improve the worst points on other trunk and inter-urban Class 1 roads which do not call for comprehensive improvement.In terms of new mileage, motorways and trunk roads are being built at about the same rate. The Governments intention is to complete a thousandmiles of motorway by the early 1970s, of which 345 miles will becompleted by March, 1965.80. The aim of the urban road programme is, with traffic managementmeasures, to increase the traffic capacity of urban streets and to improvepedestrian safety. The programme is concentrated on improvements to theradial roads and, in many cities, the construction of inner ring roads.Much of the work is being done at junctions which are generally thepoints of worst congestion. Increasingly urban road schemes are being planned in conjunction with large-scale redevelopments. Much has alreadybeen done in some areas ; by March, 1965, substantial progress will havebeen made with the inner ring roads and other major schemes at Croydon,Newport (Monmouth), Wolverhampton, Preston and Bradford, to mentionbut a few. In London, several important schemes now in progress willhave been completed, notably the Blackfriars Bridge Underpass, the widening of the southern approaches to Waterloo Bridge and the underpassfrom its northern end to Kingsway.81. The level of highways capital investment in Scotland for 1963/64is considerably higher than was forecast in last year&apos;s White Paper, andreflects the adjustment of the approved five-year programme to take accountof increases since 1960 in the cost of road works. The proportion of localauthority to Exchequer investment in classified roads will be unusuallyhigh in 1964/65 because of the special arrangements adopted for financing the Tay Road Bridge.

The housing programme covers capital expenditure by local authori-ties, by housing associations, including the Scottish Special Housing Asso-ciation, and by new town development corporations and the commission for the New Towns. Capital expenditure on buildings for employees ofthe public sector is not included ; provision for this is made under therespective programmes. In addition to new building, the programmeincludes the cost of the acquisition of land and buildings and of improve-ments carried out by local authorities and by housing associations on theirown dwellings.83. Expenditure is financed mostly by borrowing. Borrowing by localauthorities is subject to the issue of loan sanction by the Minister of housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland.Housing associations in certain circumstances may borrow from localauthorities to finance their investment. They may also receive advancesfrom the Minister of Housing and Local Government and/or the Secretaryof State for Scotland on entering into an agreement to provide dwellingsfor letting. Expenditure by the new town development corporations andby the Scottish Special Housing Association is financed directly from theTreasury.84. The Government policy statement on housing, issued in May, 1963(Cmnd. 2050), explained the need for larger local authority house building programmes in order to provide for those who cannot meet the full costof housing and to tackle the comprehensive redevelopment of slum andother decayed areas. The main effort in the local authority field continuesto be slum clearance, and will continue to be so for some years to come.The number of slums cleared in Great Britain during 1962 again reachedthe level of 75,000 houses.85. The drop in the estimated out-turn of expenditure on housing inEngland and Wales for 1962/63 compared with the figure given last yearresults from the bad weather last winter which virtually brought all house-building activities to a standstill. But for this, the increased authorisationsmade in the third quarter of the year would have necessitated higherexpenditure than previously forecast for 1962/63. It is now expectedthat expenditure during the current year will be considerably inflated bythe backlog of work from last winter.  In addition the latest 1963/64
figure, when compared with that given in Cmnd. 1849, reflects a higher rate of activity arising from an increased programme and also higher costs of local authority house-building arising in part from increased emphasis on more expensive schemes flats and redevelopment in urban centres.Underlying the 1964/65 figure is a steady increase in authorisations tolocal authorities ; in the event, however, the figure is only slightly higherthan that for 1963/64 because the current year&apos;s figure is inflated by thecarry-over of work from last winter mentioned above.86. Public authorities in Scotland started and completed fewer housesthan forecast in 1961/62 and 1962/63 but there has been a very substantial increase in the number of houses put under construction this year as thelost ground is made up. The figures of investment expenditure for 1963/64and 1964/65 given above allow for this and for a rise in the level ofbuilding by public authorities in Scotland in accordance with the Govern-menfs policy to increase output in Great Britain to the new level of350,000 houses a year announced in the White Paper on Housing (Cmnd.2050).87. Although fewer houses were started and completed in 1962/63 thanforecast, investment expenditure was greater because, as in England andWales, costs have risen. These, coupled with an expanded programme,have also caused the increase in the figure for 1963/64 as compared withthat given in last year&apos;s White Paper on Public Investment (Cmnd. 1849).Water and Sewerage  million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65England and Wales:				Water        ...............	32-9	361	36-7	38-0Sewerage    ...     ...     ...     ......	46-2	54-9	61 1	63-1Total      ............	79-1	91-0	97-8	101-1Scotland:				Water       ...............	4-8	5-4	7-7	9-9Sewerage    ...............	3-7	5-1	5-7	6-9Total      ............	8-5	10-5	13-4	16-788. The table shows capital expenditure by water boards, local authoritywater undertakings and local sewerage authorities and capital expenditureon sewerage by new town development corporations ; expenditure by private water companies is not included.89. For the most part, expenditure is financed by loans, for which localboards and authorities require loan sanction as appropriate from theMinister of Housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State forScotland, unless borrowing powers have been obtained by Act of Parlia-ment. To assist certain schemes in rural areas and development districtsgrants are paid by these ministers under the Rural Water Supplies and sewerage Acts and the Local Employment Act, 1960.90. The figures for expenditure on water schemes in England andWales show a rising level of investment reflecting the increasing demand
for water, particularly for industrial and agricultural purposes. The figurestake into account price changes since last year&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd. 1849).91. The figure for expenditure in 1963/64 on sewerage in Englandand Wales is higher than was given in October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849); this makes allowance for the expected consequence of the sharp increase inloan consents during 1962/63. The continuing effects of the Rivers (Pre-vention of Pollution) Act, 1961, together with the need to replace many ofthe older sewerage systems, suggest that there is unlikely to be any earlyfall in the level of capital expenditure necessary for sewerage and sewage disposal.92. Provision has been made in 1963/64 and 1964/65 for the continuation of some of the major water schemes for England and Wales referred to inparagraph 94 of Cmnd. 1522 and paragraph 87 of Cmnd. 1849. In additionprovision has been made for a scheme for the abstraction of water from theRiver Severn by Wolverhampton Borough Council and the South Stafford-shire Water Company ; the construction of a reservoir by the Stockport and district Water Board ; the construction of a water intake on the YorkshireDerwent for Sheffield, Leeds and Barnsley ; and the construction of areservoir and filtration plant by the Metropolitan Water Board.93. Provision has been made in 1963/64 and 1964/65 for the continuation of some of the major sewerage and sewage disposal schemes in England andWales referred to in paragraph 95 of Cmnd. 1522 and paragraph 88 of cmnd. 1849. In addition, provision has been made for the construction ofa sewage disposal works at Dagenham and a main drainage scheme byBristol City Council.94. In Scotland, the estimate of expenditure in 1963/64 is  0-6 million higher than that forecast last year, due mainly to the provision of water supplies required in connection with industrial development at Linwood,Renfrewshire, and to the construction of Glasgow Corporation^ newreservoir at Glen Finglas. A substantial increase in expenditure is expected in 1964/65, when it is likely that a start will be made on an  8 millionscheme to tap Loch Lomond as a major source of water supply to cater for industrial development in Central Scotland and to serve the New Townsat Cumbernauld and Livingston. Other large water schemes for which provision is made include regional schemes at present under construction in (i) Dumfriesshire, (ii) Perth, Clackmannan and Stirling, (iii) Angus andKincardine, and (iv) West Lothian, and new schemes in Ayrshire andAberdeenshire. A great deal of sewerage and sewage purification workrequires to be carried out throughout the country and expenditure is likelyto increase over the next few years. Provision is made for a large schemewhich Glasgow Corporation have put in hand for the modernisation of theirsewage disposal works ; new schemes to serve the large industrial develop-ments in West Lothian and Renfrewshire will be carried out with the aid of grants under the Local Employment Act, 1960.

The greater part of this expenditure is undertaken by local educationauthorities working within allocations administered by the Ministry ofEducation and the Scottish Education Department. Expenditure by localeducation authorities is, for the most part, financed by borrowing, and theloan charges, together with capital expenditure from revenue, are taken intoaccount in fixing the general grant.96. In the White Paper &quot; Secondary Education for All a New Drive &quot;(Cmnd. 604), presented to Parliament in December 1958, it was announcedthat the Government aimed to get work costing  500 million started in thefive year period 1960/61 to 1964/65. The value of major school building projects started in England and Wales amounted to over  190 million inthe three years 1960/61 to 1962/63. Starts of  55 million in 1963/64 and 60 million in 1964/65 have been authorised. As well as providing for increases and shifts of school population the five year programme will complete the elimination of all-age schools and substantially increase thenumber of new science laboratories. Though progress is being made withimproving or replacing old schools the task of bringing all pre-war buildingsup to modern standards remains a formidable one, which has been assessed by a survey of all maintained schools. The findings, which will be published,will be an important step towards determining school building priorities in the years ahead.97. Starts at Colleges of Advanced Technology will be increased fromthe current level of  2 million to  4 million in 1964/65. The building programme for further education will also be increased by  1-2 million to 16 million in that year, mainly for new technical colleges and majorextensions. This is necessary to enable the colleges to meet the demandfor places at all levels, which continues to grow at a rapid rate.98. In addition to the programme for 24,000 new places at the teacher training colleges referred to in previous White Papers, a further  7 million of expenditure was authorised in 1963 to develop and expand college
buildings so that a figure of 80,000 students in training can be reached by1970.99. Some  4 million is expected to be spent on Youth Service buildings in 1963/64, and work authorised to start in 1964/65 has been increased to 4-5 million. These projects include many facilities for sport and recreationadditional to the playing fields and gymnasia which form part of the normalprovision for schools and colleges.100. An extra  6 million minor works starts were authorised in October,1962, and all minor works restrictions were subsequently lifted for the periodJanuary-March 1963 for certain areas in N.E. and N.W. England as atemporary measure to ease unemployment. In consequence over  19 million of minor works were started in 1962/63.101. The figures for expenditure on land, plant, equipment and feeshave been re-assessed on the latest information available and an additional sum of  3- 4 million per annum has been included to cover expenditure on new equipment for existing buildings. This item, together with a substantial increase in the estimate for land purchases, largely accounts for the higher level of expenditure under this head when compared with Cmnd. 1849.102. In Scotland the provision for school building is based on the 5-year programme for 1960/61 to 1964/65 envisaged in the White Paper &quot;Educa-tion in Scotland The Next Step &quot; (Cmnd. 603) presented to Parliament inDecember, 1958. The greater part of this programme has had to be devotedto the provision of new schools to cope with shifts of population to new towns or other new housing developments. As forecast, expenditure on further education in 1962/63 is markedly higher and represents work doneon a number of projects started earlier, all within a short time of eachother. For subsequent years the figures reflect a more even spread ofstarts. The programme for the expansion of teacher training colleges isnow showing a marked increase. The table includes for the first timeexpenditure under the Physical Training and Recreation Act previouslyincluded in other investment by local authorities.University Grants Committee  million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65Land, buildings       ............	21-4	25-1	32-3	38-9Plant and equipment         .........	4-8	7-7	7-8	9-4Total      ............	26-2	32-8	40-1	48-3103. Funds are voted annually by Parliament (Class VII, Vote 1) for exchequer grants to the Universities. These include capital (or non-recurrent) grants for the erection of new, and the adaptation of existing,buildings ; for the payment of professional fees; for the equipment of newaccommodation including the equipment of new science buildings ; andfor the purchase of sites and properties. Details of major schemes inprogress, and of schemes due to start in the current year, are given inAppendix II to the 1963/64 Estimates.
104. Investment in the universities is largely determined by a programmeof building work to be started over a period of years, and is designed tomake provision for the massive expansion of University places currentlyunder way. The value of building work started rose from  15 million in1961 to  30 million in 1963 ; work expected to cost a total of  33-5 million will be started in 1964, and the Universities have been asked to plan onthe basis of a further  33-5 million of building starts in 1965. The grantspaid annually by the Government to the Universities are adjusted as necessary to take account of increases in the cost of projects started in previous years.105. Outside the main University building programme, but also financed from non-recurrent grants, there are capital developments in UniversityDental and Medical Schools, which are undertaken in connection with thehospital building programmes, and a special expansion programme for theImperial College of Science and Technology. An overall ceiling of  17-5 million (for building work) has been authorised for the latter programme ;this will now be augmented by the addition of  1 million from the generalprogrammes for 1964 and 1965.106. The total figure for investment in any one year covers work on building projects begun in that year and in previous years, together withrelated expenditure on sites, professional fees and furniture and equipment.The greatly increased figures for 1963/64, therefore, reflect the increasedstarts authorised for 1963 and previous calendar years. The rapidly increasing expenditure on University capital developments is to support the rapid rate of expansion in the number of students which has been planned.At the end of the last quinquennium (1961/62) there were about 113,000full-time students at Universities in Great Britain ; and the Governmenthave expressed their wish that the additional funds being made availableshould be applied as far as possible to achieving a University population ofabout 150,000 full-time students in 1966/67. Such an increase in numbers,equivalent to 33 per cent in five years, will keep pace with the rapidly increasing size of the University entrance age group.Hospital Services  million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65England and Wales Hospitals: Major projects   ............

Subject in all cases to the direction of the Minister of Health andthe Secretary of State for Scotland, capital expenditure on hospitals is theresponsibility of Regional Hospital Boards, except for teaching hospitals in England and Wales, where the Boards of Governors are responsible.Expenditure included in the table above is financed wholly from theExchequer, through the National Health Service Votes (Class VI, Votes 14,16 and 18).108. The rapidly increasing rate of investment in hospitals in Englandand Wales was anticipated in &quot; A Hospital Plan for England and Wales &quot;(Cmnd. 1604) which set out a programme of hospital building to be started in the decade ending 1970/71. The first of the annual reviews of the plan,published in April, 1963, carries the hospital building programme forward to 1972/73.109. The programme rests on broad assumptions about the availability of capital funds. For the first five years of the decade 1963/64 to 1972/73expenditure of  250 million has been assumed, and for the next five yearsexpenditure of  350 million. These sums are not commitments, however,and the rate of implementation of the programme will be reviewed annually.110. Details of the major building schemes now in progress are givenin Appendix IV to the Hospital Services Vote in the 1963/64 Estimates.A comprehensive list of work completed and in progress is published bythe Ministry of Health in a series of six-monthly progress reports.111. A comprehensive plan for the development of the hospital services in Scotland for the decade ending 1970/71 was set out in the &quot;HospitalPlan for Scotland&quot; (Cmnd. 1602) presented to Parliament in January, 1962.The hospital service will have as its focal points the main teaching hospitals in the four cities, all of which are to be replaced or improved. New district general hospitals in other main population centres will replace a variety of separate units. For planning purposes capital expenditure of  70 million over the ten-year period has been assumed.112. Details of the major building schemes now in progress to implement the Plan are given in Appendix IV to the Scottish Health Services Vote inthe 1963/64 Estimates.

These programmes are the responsibility of local authorities.Expenditure is.financed mainly from borrowing within allocations adminis-tered by the Ministry of Health or the Scottish Home and Health Depart-ment, but also from authorities&apos; revenue.114. The increasing level of investment in the local health and welfare services reflects the policy that those in need of care or treatment shouldwherever possible receive it in the community and should become hospitalin-patients only if the treatment or care required can only be provided in a hospital. All the local health and welfare authorities in Englandand Wales have prepared long-term plans for the development of their services on this footing ; these have been summarised in the recent white paper Health and Welfare The Development of Community Care (Cmnd.1973) and will be revised each year to keep them up-to-date. These plansprovide for, amongst other things, the expansion and improvement of residential accommodation for the elderly (whose numbers continue torise) and of training centres and residential accommodation for the men-tally disordered.115. The health and welfare responsibilities of Scottish local authoritiesare not exactly the same as in England and Wales: the ambulance service is centrally financed and much of the cost of providing centres for men-tally handicapped children is met by education authorities. Continuedgrowth of the services is envisaged, with particular emphasis on expansionof mental health facilities, new welfare homes for old people and higher standards in some existing homes.

This expenditure is normally financed from the appropriate depart-mental votes.117. Investment in agriculture and fishing is administered by the Minis-try of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agricultureand Fisheries for Scotland (Class V, Votes 2, 7, 9 and 10). It includesinvestment by the Ministry in smallholdings, experimental husbandryfarms, horticulture stations and fishery research, and by the Land Settle-ment Association on the Ministry&apos;s behalf ; investment by the department in smallholdings, research institutes, agricultural colleges, and fishery protection vessels; investment by the Herring Industry Board ; and thepurchase by the Department of vessels for charter for Highlands and Islandsshipping services.118. Investment expenditure by the Forestry Commission is on theconstruction of forest roads; purchase of vehicles and road constructionplant (mainly replacements); construction of buildings and acquisition ofland (Class V, Vote 11).119. Expenditure on Government buildings, including the provision of office furniture, is borne on the Votes of the Ministry of Public building and Works (Class IX, Votes 2, 7, 8 and 9). The largest of the currentprojects being carried out under Votes 2, 7, 8 and 9 are set out in the appendices to these Votes in the 1963/64 Estimates.120. The figures for investment in factory buildings relate to expendi-ture by the Board of Trade (Class IV, Vote 3) on land, building and sitedevelopment under the Local Employment Act, 1960. The factories and extensions to factories are, in the main, built to be leased or sold onamortisation terms to manufacturers setting up or expanding productionin development districts. They are generally erected in response to requestsfrom manufacturers but some are built in advance of demand.   At the
present time work is proceeding on advance factories which will have atotal area of J million square feet, and are expected to cost  2-5 million.The figures in the table do not cover privately-built factories in develop-ment districts even where they are financed with the assistance of grants or loans from the Board of Trade.121. Expenditure on civil airports and air traffic control services is administered by the Ministry of Aviation (Class IV, Vote 9). The mainprojects are, at London (Heathrow) Airport, apron and pier development,runway extensions, extension of freight handling facilities and new road-works connected with the motorway entrance to the airport; at London(Gatwick) Airport, extensions to the terminal building and runway, anddevelopment of aprons and piers ; at Prestwick Airport, the constructionof a new terminal building, aprons and taxiways ; and the conversion for civil use of the former Admiralty aerodrome at Abbotsinch as a replace-ment for Renfrew Airport.122. There will continue to be substantial expenditure on the extensionof air traffic control systems, and the Ministry is also purchasing two new aircraft to be used for the flight testing of navigational aids in the upperair space.123. Part of the expenditure on capital facilities for the aeronautical research programme at the Ministry of Aviation&apos;s Establishments is re-garded as civil investment (Class IV, Vote 7). The purpose of this pro-gramme is to provide a background of scientific knowledge for progressin aeronautics. The programme includes work directed towards improvedsafety, reliability and economy in the operation of aircraft, the investiga-tion of problems associated with high speed flight and the exploitation ofnew techniques such as vertical take-off. The capital investment requiredfor this purpose will be in test facilities for aircraft and engines, laboratoryequipment and the like.124. Expenditure on harbours by the Ministry of Transport (Class IV,Vote 13) covers the provision of emergency facilities at various ports and capital expenditure at Faslane Port in Scotland.125. Expenditure on oil storage and distribution is by the Ministry of power (Class IV, Vote 15) for the provision of emergency facilities.126. Expenditure on civil defence is undertaken by the Home Officeand the Scottish Home and Health Department (Class III, Votes 3 and 4).127. Expenditure on prisons is financed from the Home Office and scottish Home and Health Department Prison Votes (Class III, Votes 7 and). The building programme initiated in 1959 at present provides for over forty new establishments in England and Wales and eleven inScotland. These are needed to relieve over-crowding and to provide facili-ties for observation of unsentenced prisoners and for new methods oftreatment. About one-half of the new establishments in the programmehave been completed and brought into use, including, in England andWales, a new psychiatric prison, the first of a series of remand centres,and the first of a new type of security prison for men, and, in Scotland,two new detention centres, two remand centres and a small Borstal. Thenumber of detention centres for young offenders has been increased from
four to fifteen in England and Wales, and from one to two in Scotland.Both in England and Wales and in Scotland provision is made for new and improved staff quarters.128. The remaining capital expenditure by the Home Office and theScottish Home and Health Department includes the two police colleges and the training centres, the fire services college, the provision of wirelessequipment for the police and fire services, and licensed and ancillarypremises in the State Management Districts.129. Expenditure by the Department of Scientific and industrial research (Class VII, Vote 4) is on capital equipment for the Departmentsown establishments and provided in research grants to universities andothers. Expenditure on buildings for the Departments own use is borne on the Votes of the Ministry of Public Building and Works (see paragraph117).130. Expenditure by the Stationery Office (Class IX, Vote 9) is mainly on office machinery, including automatic data processing equipment, forthe government service.131. The grant-aided bodies whose investment is shown in the Tablecomprise the Medical Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council,the Nature Conservancy and the British Council. Investment by certain other grant-aided bodies is included under other headings.Other Investment by Local Authorities  million	1961/62		1962/63		1963/64		1964/65Great Britain							Road passenger transport.........	6	6	5	0	7	9	5-8Car parks   ...............	2	2	4	1	7	3	9-6Municipal aerodromes     .........	2	5	2	1	2	4	40Docks and harbours       .........	9	3	10	9	14	5	15-8England and Wales							Unclassified roads and road lighting	15	0	16	0	19	0	19-0Police and fire services    .........	9	0	12	0	13	0	15-5Expenditure under Town and Country							Planning Acts    ............	15	9	16	0	22	3	22-6Agriculture, fishing, arterial drainage and							sea defence       ............	13	6	15	0	17	9	181Civil defence        ............	0	8	1	0	1	7	2-1New towns ...      ............	8	5	7	5	10	6	11-general services    ............	48	9	48	7	59	7	69- scotland							Unclassified roads and road lighting	3	0	3	1	3	1	3-4Police and fire services    .........	1	3	1	0	1	3	1-6Expenditure under Town and Country							Planning Acts    ............	1	1	1	2	1	6	2-0Agriculture and fishing    .........	0	3	0	3	0	8	0-9Civil defence        ............	0	1	0	2	0	3	0-3New towns...............	1	1	1	9	2	7	2-general services    ............	2	7	3	6	5	1	6-8Total   ............	141	9	149	6	191	2	211-2
132. For the most part this expenditure is financed from local authori-ties&apos; internal resources or by borrowing; some items attract specificGovernment grants.133. Expenditure on road passenger transport is mainly upon thepurchase of vehicles for local authority bus fleets but also upon theconstruction of garages, bus stations and shelters. Total investment in1963/64 is now estimated at  7-9 million,  2-1 million higher than theestimate given in October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849). This increase is largely dueto the incidence of payments on the various projects comprising the glasgow tram conversion scheme, which was started in 1958 and is notyet completed.134. About one-half of the expenditure on municipal aerodromes in1964/65 will be for the extension of terminal buildings, runways andassociated works at Liverpool and Manchester. The rest of the investment is spread over a number of aerodromes.135. Nearly half the expenditure on car parks (including provision forlorries and coaches) is upon the acquisition of land, with any buildings which may be on it. About half the total investment is in the LondonTraffic Area, where congestion is greatest and control of street parking is most advanced.136. Investment in docks and harbours is carried out by dock and harbour authorities. These are mainly independent statutory public trustsbut some are under the control of local councils. Expenditure is financed from internal sources or by borrowing. Similar expenditure by the british transport Docks Board is included in the table on page above. TheGovernment has accepted the recommendation of the Report of theRochdale Committee of Inquiry into the Major Ports of Great Britain(Cmnd. 1824) that there should be a higher level of investment in ports,and the recently established National Ports Council will advise the Ministerof Transport on any proposals for major items of port development.137. Expenditure on unclassified roads and road lighting is additional to the expenditure upon roads shown on page . It includes expenditureon trunk road lighting, which is met in equal shares by Exchequer grants and by the local lighting authorities.138. Expenditure on police and fire services continues to increase. Themain needs are the replacement of obsolete stations and the provision ofnew stations to match movements of population and to replace stationsdemolished in connection with comprehensive urban development schemes and the improvement of local fire service training facilities.139. Expenditure under the Town and Country Planning Acts is chieflyupon the acquisition of land by local authorities for comprehensiveredevelopment, mainly in town centres, and upon town expansion schemes under the Town Development Act, 1952. Expenditure in 1962/63 was slightly less than forecast in October, 1962 (Cmnd. 1849), but the forecast for 1963/64 has been increased in view of the heavy commitments in towncentre redevelopment and the plans for town expansion. The forecast for1964/65 again shows an increase for the same reasons. Expenditure underthis head also includes development by local authorities under section 79of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1962-notably factory buildings,
on which local authorities spent  1-6 million in 1962/63, chiefly for purposesof the Local Employment Act, 1960.140. The principal expenditure under agriculture, fishing, arterialdrainage and sea defence relates to arterial drainage and sea defence (over one-half) and slaughterhouses (about one-quarter). The former continues toincrease due chiefly to the need for local authorities to improve water-courses following urban development. The latter continues at acomparatively high level mainly in consequence of the SlaughterhousesAct, 1958.141. Expenditure on civil defence is almost wholly incurred on theprovision of training premises and operational controls. Both forms of spending are expected to increase during 1964/65.142. The expenditure on new towns shown here is by the new town development corporations and the Commission for the New Towns on thebuilding of factories, offices and shops; expenditure on housing and sewerageis included in the main programmes under these headings. These townsare playing an important part in relieving the congestion in London and elsewhere, and the various forms of development have to be organised as a unified operation and kept in proper, relation to each other. The figures given include expenditure in the 15 new towns already well established, andin addition make provision for the first few years&apos; work in the recentlydesignated new towns of Dawley, Livingston and Skelmersdale. expenditure by development corporations is financed by borrowing from the Exchequerunder the New Towns Act, 1946 ; and expenditure by the Commission forthe New Towns is similarly financed under the New Towns Act, 1959. InScotland the main objective of the&apos; investment is to assist in the rehousingand re-employment of Glasgow&apos;s overspill population and to create newgrowth.143. General services include capital expenditure on approved schools and remand homes. The quantity and the quality of the accommodationhas become inadequate in face of the increasing numbers committed bythe courts, and an enlarged building programme was launched in I960. Itis designed to provide additional accommodation, to replace old buildions or bring them up to modern standards and to improve facilities for training.The programme has since been further expanded to provide a larger numberof new schools. Expenditure on children&apos;s homes is mainly devoted to theprovision of family group homes and small homes to replace the older and larger institutional type.144. General services also include coast protection works, miscellaneousland acquisition and the provision of town halls and offices, libraries an3museums, swimming baths and recreation grounds, cemeteries and crematoria,markets, depots and equipment for refuse collection and street cleansing.Expenditure on all these services has continued to rise with the gradualeasing of the restrictions which had to be imposed in the second half of1961. Local authorities have become notably more active in the provisionof facilities for sport and physical recreation. The renewal of council offices and buying by authorities of land required for the benefit, improvement anddevelopment of their district also contribute to the rising rate of investmentunder this head. With the coming into operation of the Local Authorities(Land) Act, 1963, which extends the powers of authorities to acquire land,this tendency is likely to increase in 1964/65.

APPENDIX II - -Sport and Physical RecreationIn the debate on Government encouragement of sport in the House of lords on 22nd May, 1963, the Lord President of the Council indicated (official report, Col. 385) that investment in sport and physical recreation would be separately identified and shown in the annual White Paper on Public Investment.In 1961 the measures taken by the Government to relieve the pressure ofinternal demand upon productive resources included the postponement of any government action on the recommendations of the Wolfenden Committee intheir Report on Sport and the Community. On 8th May, 1962, however, theChancellor. of the Exchequer was able to announce substantial relaxations inthe limitations on capital investment in facilities for sport and physical recreation,and further relaxations, including increases in Exchequer grants to voluntary organisations, were announced by the Lord President on 22nd May, 1963.The table below shows that expenditure on facilities exclusively for sportoutside educational institutions is expected to reach  14-6 million in 1964/65,compared with about  6 million in 1961/62. This represents an increase ofabout 135 per cent over the three years. Total investment expenditure onsport and physical recreation amounted to  21-1 million in 1961/62 and is planned to rise to  35-1 million in 1964/65-an increase of about 66 per cent.Investment Expenditure* on facilities for Sport and Physical Recreation  million	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	1964/65Facilities exclusively for sport Physical Training and Recreation Acts and other powersf (a) local authorities.........

APPENDIX HINotes on definitions1. This White Paper is concerned with the gross fixed capital formation ofthe civil public sector in Great Britain. Except that sales of land and fixed assets are not deducted, the definition of gross fixed capital formation is the sameas that used in the Blue Book National Income and Expenditure, as explained in National Income Statistics: Sources and Methods, published .by H.M.Stationery Office. It comprises expenditure on replacement of, and additions and major improvements to, fixed capital assets located in Great Britain. Fixed assetsare land, buildings, civil engineering works (e.g. roads, reservoirs, drainage works,etc.), vehicles, ships and aircraft plant and machinery. The word &quot; fixed &quot; denotesthe exclusion of changes in stocks (if any), and &quot; gross &quot; that no allowance ismade for depreciation. Ships and aircraft, wherever based, are included if owned by public authorities in Great Britain.2. In coverage this White Paper differs in certain respects from the Blue Book.Northern Ireland and the iron and steel companies still in public ownership are excluded and certain capital formation by private bodies financed from public funds is included. In the Blue Book the figures for the public sector includeNorthern Ireland and the iron and steel companies still in public ownership butexclude private capital formation financed from public funds.3. In this White Paper local authorities have been defined as all bodies coveredby the provisions of Part XI of the Local Government Act, 1933, and Part XIIIof the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947, plus the Scottish Special housing association and the new town development corporations, which are defined as public corporations in National Income Statistics: Sources and Methods. the atomic Energy Authority is treated as a public corporation in this White Paper,whereas the Blue Book classifies it under central Government.4. Most of the figures for expenditure on the individual programmes are forthe accounting years of the authorities concerned. The South of scotland electricity Board and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board work to acalendar year, and the accounting year of the National Coal Board ends on theSaturday nearest to 31st December ; but the figures given in this White Paper are for financial years (1st April-31st March). The successor bodies to british transport Commission also work to a calendar year, and in these cases thefigures have not been adjusted to a financial year basis.5. The following table shows the adjustments necessary to convert the totalsin this White Paper to the National Income and Expenditure Blue Book basis:  million1961/62        1962/63White Paper total (as in table on page  )Northern Ireland...............University Grants Committee.........Other adjustments (net)............National Income and Expenditure basisPrinted in England and published by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office(30989)   Wt. 669-164   200Bks 10/63   St.S.
