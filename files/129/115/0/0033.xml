THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1963CP. (63) 33 Copy No. Jj 117th December, 1963CABINETAGRICULTURAL policy memorandum by the secretary of state for industry, trade and regionalDevelopmentIn May we decided to try to negotiate arrangements for cereals and beefunder which, in return for our effectively limiting home production, our overseas suppliers would agree to some restrictions on imports in order to avoidunduly low prices and thus to save money for the Exchequer. I am disturbed thatin the process of discussion and negotiation with the farmers&apos; unions the emphasis seems almost imperceptibly to have changed. Perhaps it has beeninevitable in the circumstances of the time and the nature of the negotiations.We started with the emphasis on the containment of domestic agricultural production at its present overall level combined with some means of influencingimport prices, in the case of cereals, or quantities, in the case of meat, with theobject of putting some limit to the open ended commitment of the Exchequer.The emphasis now appears to be on the limitation of imports in order to providefor our own farmers an increasing share of the home market. If this is necessaryto get the standard quantity concept accepted by the farmers, then we need toconsider whether that concept will any longer serve the purposes which we hadin mind.2. It is because of this change in emphasis and balance that I believe weshould again remind ourselves of the fundamental economic factors in thesituation, as well as of the social and political ones which are always to the fore.We cannot judge to what extent the social and political should be allowed toprevail without a clear appreciation of the economic cost and of the implications for our relations with overseas suppliers, mainly Commonwealth countries andthe United States.The Economic Case3. Farmers and farmworkers account for 4 per cent of the population. they receive a remarkable degree of assistance from the other 96 per cent. The whole ofthe farmers&apos; net income some  400 million a year is in effect supplied by subsidies and other forms of support: their own efforts do no more than cover their costs.But they are not all inefficient, as the following table of sample figures shows:Range of Costs Guaranteed PriceWheat       ... 9s. 8d. per cwt.     - 18s. 3d.  1 6s. lid.(South-East England)      (North-East England)Barley       ... 10s. lid. 12s. 9d.  1 7s.   7d.(South-East England)       (North-East England)Beef......  6 17s. 8d.  8 18s. 4d.  8 7s.

2 SECRET&apos;4. Some of our farming is therefore efficient and profitable, and should becompetitive with little or no assistance. Our form of support by and large givesas much help to the large efficient farmer on productive soil as to the small farmeron poor soil. The cost of this support has been rising, as the following table of changes over the last five years shows. The rise has been due not to competition from imports which have been decreasing but to the effort to produce moreourselves:Change between 1958-59 and 1962-63*Wheat and flourBarleyBeef and vealHome Supplies4-  7 million-\-  38 million-f 99,000 tonsImports 16 million 21 million22,000 tonsSubsidy-  3 million4-  13 million4-  6 million* More detailed figures of imports, home production and cost of subsidies are given in Annexes 1and II.The total cost of direct subsidies to farmers has increased from  241 million in1958-59 to over  300 million: and in addition farmers receive indirect support atthe cost of the Exchequer or the consumer which amounts to another  100 million or so a year. (For example marketing schemes and import restrictions for potatoesand milk (our milk is the dearest in Europe), rating relief, taxation privilege.)Moreover a great deal of capital has been put into farming: gross fixed capital formation increased by 45 per cent between 1957 and 1961.5. Whether this assistance to the farmers comes from the Exchequer or fromthe consumer it is a charge upon our resources: there is so much less to devote toother forms of growth. What do we get in return? In the last decade the net outputof manufacturing industry has risen by 85 per cent, that of agriculture, forestryand fishing by 30 per cent. The net output per person engaged in industry was 925 a year in 1961-62, and in agriculture,  680.6. It is clear from the foregoing that the more of our resources we put intoagriculture, the poorer will be our prospects of achieving more rapid growth ofthe economy, and the rise in our living standards will be lower than it otherwisecould be.Implications for Overseas Trade7. If the implications of our agricultural policy are serious at home, they are equally serious for our external relations. I am not concerned to argue the merits of our traditional cheap food policy, though I believe that it has served us well byhelping to keep down costs and to make our economy more competitive. Whatmatters is that this policy or at any rate relatively free access to our market is of vital importance to some of our biggest customers and closest friends Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States and they will, as we sawduring the Brussels negotiations, fight vigorously to retain it. We accepted that ifwe entered the Common Market we would have to modify our arrangements, butwe should have got compensating advantages. Now there are no comparablecompensations and we can only prejudice our own interests by failing to take account of the interests of our suppliers.8. In the negotiations which the Minister of Agriculture has been carryingon since May for interim arrangements with our principal suppliers of cereals and meat, he has offered to contain home production and allow overseas suppliers tomaintain their share of our market as it expands, if they would agree to waive theirtreaty rights and limit their exports to us or hold their prices to our market above astated level. At the same time he has taken the lead in putting forward proposalsfor long-term world-wide arrangements on much the same lines in the GATTcommodity groups in Geneva.9. If we cannot now implement these offers, we cannot expect other countries to waive their rights; and if we ignore them by imposing levies or quotas on our imports from them, v/e risk retaliation against our trade, in Europe as well as inthe Commonwealth and the United States, on a much bigger scale than the&quot; Chicken War &quot;. After all, these rights have not been conceded by us for nothing :we receive important advantages in return.
SECRET3Cereals10. The Minister of Agriculture invites us to accept that in default ofagreement we should impose levies on imports of cereals. This would mean breaking the following international agreements:(i) binding of free entry on wheat to the United States;(ii) binding of 10 per cent duty on barley to the United States and Chile;(iii) guarantee of free entry for wheat and barley under surviving ottawa agreements;(iv) guarantee of free entry under 1947 Exchange of Letters with Canada;(v) guarantee of free entry under Anglo-Australian Trade Agreement, 1957;(vi) most favoured nation (m.f.n.) rights enjoyed by most other suppliers,including the Argentine, under the GATT or Commercial Treaties.We might negotiate release from the bindings under (i) and (ii) but the price in theform of other concessions would be very high. The Commonwealth countries would no doubt retaliate against our preferences in their markets, which are still very valuable.Meat11. The Minister also refers to the possibility of imposing quotas on importsof beef in default of agreement. Unless we imposed equivalent restrictions on home production which would preserve the existing balance between home productionand imports, this would be contrary to the GATT whose members would be entitledto retaliate against our trade. It would also in any event be contrary to the MeatAgreement with Australia (which cannot be terminated before 1967), the 1952Joint Declaration with New Zealand (which also runs to 1967) and the 1938 trade agreement with the Irish Republic.12. Unilateral action on either commodity would seriously endanger theprospects for the Kennedy Round. Access for agricultural products is the centralissue in the negotiations between the United States and the Six; any retreat nowfrom the position which we have taken up in the Cereals and Meat Groups wouldbe a serious blow to the negotiations as a whole, and would be eagerly exploitedby the French. It would enable them to pass to us responsibility for damage to the kennedy Round which should properly rest on the E.E.C.An Alternative Course13. For all these reasons I find the following aspects of the Minister ofAgriculture^ proposals disturbing:(i) the emphasis which he places on the further expansion of home productionwith the implication that the home farmer must be enabled to secure alarger share of the market. Since agriculture is not viable withoutsupport, this would entail an increasing burden on the economy;(ii) the lack of precision in the proposals put to our trading partners in returnfor voluntary restraint of their sales to us. Even if we succeed in negotiating voluntary arrangements with them, I am afraid that werisk finding ourselves involved in a bitter dispute with our overseas suppliers because home production turns out to be larger than they expected, and with our own farmers if we attempt to put this right bylowering the standard quantities;(iii) the proposal that we should in default of voluntary arrangements imposelevies on imported cereals in breach of our treaty obligations;(iv) the possibility that we might similarly impose quotas on imports of beef.14. Unless we can get clear and precise agreements which are accepted by our overseas suppliers and our farmers, we should in my view accept whateverrisk there is to the Exchequer in going on for the present with our existing policy.We should meanwhile continue to work in the GATT for long-term agreements for meat and cereals on the lines which we have already suggested. At the same time we should examine the possibility of improving our own arrangements formmSECRET3662 a 2

We ought to try to find ways of supporting our farmerswhich will insulate them less completely from the discipline of the market; facilitate the more orderly marketing of both home and imported supplies; provide anadequate standard of living for the smaller farmers whom we wish to preserve for social reasons while leaving the progressive and efficient to rely in an increasingdegree on their own competitive ability; and maintain for overseas suppliers the opportunities in our market to which our international commitments entitle themand which our trading interests require.E.
