Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1963CP. (63) 10 Copy No.   5 i11th November, 1963CABINETSOUTH AFRICA: UNITED NATIONS DEBATE ON APARTHEIDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and for the colonies the Foreign Secretary (CP. (63) 6) has drawn attention to the likelihood ofour being faced with the choice either of using our veto in the Security Councilto defeat a resolution calling for some form of sanctions against South Africaor of abstaining and thus acquiescing in its adoption.2. He hopes to secure the substitution of a more moderate resolution.However, it is uncertain whether this will succeed. If it does not, a more extremeresolution will be tabled, on which the Americans may abstain, but which they willprobably not vote against.3. If for the first time we used the veto on Apartheid, and did so in isolation, no amount of verbal condemnation of Apartheid will dispel theimpression that we are South Africa&apos;s principal supporter.4. This would completely alienate the sympathy of the African and asian countries of the Commonwealth, just at the moment when we most need their co-operation and understanding over the difficult decisions we shall very soonhave to take in regard to Southern Rhodesia.5. For this reason, if for no other, I am sure we cannot at this junctureafford to use our veto to support South Africa in connection with Apartheid.D. S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,10th November, 1963.3450THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
