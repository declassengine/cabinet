f I5QDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C..P.M3) 1C COPY NC. ^5.1.19th November, 1963CABINETTHE FUTURE OF EUROPEANfarming land in kenyaMemorandum by the Secretary of State or Commonwealth Relations and fgratho^ ColoniesRecent developments in Kenya (especially in the CentralKikuyu Region) cause me increasing anxiety about the future of the mixed European farmers.   I judge it to be essential that v/e should announce immediately new measures to facilitate the transfer of substantial additional acreages to African ownership.2.       The European mixed farming area (about 3  million acres)represents about half of the Highlands, the remainder being mainlyranching and plantation land.   I am concerned with the mixed farmingareas because they are the kind of land most coveted by Africans.3.       The present schemes will result in the transfer of something over 1 million acres of mixed farming land to African ownership.Aft^r allowing for transfers which have taken place privately or through the Land Bank, there will remain about 1, 25 C Europeanmixed farmers who will not be touched by the present arrangements.Allowing for estimated future transfers to the Land Bank, this numbercan be reduced to 850.4.       Last month the Kenya Government proposed that an extra550,000 acres should be added to the present scheme.   They also asked that sufficient money should be provided to enable the transfer,through the Land Bank, of another 500,000 acres over the next fiveyears.   The 550,000 acres include 374,000 acres in the CentralRegion of which 350, 000 acres are particularly vulnerable.5.       Their proposals were motivated by the increasing difficulties and dangers which were confronting European farmers in this R ;gion.The Annex to this Memorandum contains a recent security assessment. -It is clear that European farmers (many of whom are not covered by existing schemes) are at considerable risk in this Region. Illegalsquatting, thieving, trespass, and in some cases personal attack aremaking it increasingly difficult for European farmers to carry on.6.      I receive many reports concerning individual farmers whichare extremely distressing, and there is little doubt that there is astrong feeling in Parliament (particularly amongst our own supporters)that, in the absence of a plan to assist them, our people are beingabandoned to fend for themselves in conditions of danger.-1-
secret fiI conclude that it is of the utmost importance to announceimmediately our intention to assist the Kenya Government to makeplans for the purchase over the next 3j years of some 350, 000 acres of land in the Central Region which is exposed to the dangers I have described.   The detailed scheme put forward by the Kenya Governmentis not satisfactory in a number of respects and it would be necessaryfor some modifications to be suggested.   Meanwhile, however, Ithink it is essential that we should announce our agreement inprinciple to assist Kenya to deal with the situation.   The cost would beabout  3.1 million spread, over four years.   It would cater for 110of the 1,250 farmers mentioned in paragraph 3.G.      During the recent conference, the European delegationrepresenting the farming community expressed the opinion that therewas no long-term future for European mixed farmers and, for thisreason, pressed for a scheme which would in effect deal with thewhole of the remainder of the mixed farmers inside and outside theCentral P-egi on.   Since the conference Kenyatta&apos;s Government havebeen reviewing this general problem and in the last few days theGovernor has reported his view that, although it may be possible fora number of mixed farmers to hang on for a limited number of years,there is in the medium and long-term no real future for them.9.       This conclusion is most disappointing, but I consider it to bea realistic view.   There is little doubt that excessive land hunger in parts of Kenya, fed by nationalist emotion, and the practicalconsideration of a rapidly increasing population, will progressivelysqueese out almost all Europeans who are farming the type of landthat Africans most desire.   In a sense, particularly in the Rift Valley,where a great many of the mixed farmers operate, our people have for a considerable period acted as a buffer between tribes competingfor land.   We could rely on them to continue to do so so long as we ourselves were governing Kenya, but we cannot expect them to do soindefinitely after we have handed over control.10.     My second conclusion is therefore that we must give the bulkof these people the promise that a further substantial transfer of land will be facilitated by the United Kingdom Government, even though this may lead to a lowering of production in Kenya,   I think that thebest way of doing this would be for me to make an immediate announcement to the effect tha.t the situation would be reviewed early next year.   (It will be recalled that the  Million Acre11 scheme was due to be reviewed in its last year, 1966-67.11.      In the light of our experience of the Million Acre scheme, itis very doubtful whether it would be physically possible to cope withthe further substantial transfer purely through high density settle -ment.   There will have to be considerable flexibility in future arrangements for land transfer.   We may have to turn to some extentaway from high density settlement towards transfer through the LandBank, tenant schemes and various forms of Government farming.Details will have to be worked out in conjunction with the independentGovernment of Kenya, but it is important that we should declare nowour intention to conduct this review, if we are to give the Kenya government a reasonable chance of steadying the present threats ofwide-scale incursion onto land.-2-
12,      It is difficult to estimate the cost involved in ouch a further large transfer of land without knowing the acreages involved andthe methods to be adopted;  and without knowing also the system of valuation to be employed.    I believe that it might be somewherebetween an additional  14 million at a minimum^hut perhaps goingup to as much as  21 million or thereabouts.    (This includes the 3.1 million proposed in paragraph &quot;^).    This money would bespread over something like five years.    We are already committedunder existing schemes to the provision between now and30ih June, 1967, of nearly  14 million.13.      My colleagues will be aware that a campaign is currently being organised on behalf of the 200 or so farmers, mainly ex-servicemen, who went out to Kenya after the war under governmentsponsored plans.    They are claiming special priority treatment.If we agree in principle on plans which may in due course cover the great bulk of the remaining JHuropean mixed farmers, they also will be covered;  but I do not think that, taking all circum-stances into account, the United Kingdom Government is tinder agreater obligation to them than they are to others who wereencouraged to go out and farm in Kenya.14.      I have explained the need for early statements to cover both the situation in the Central Region and the projected review.It would be particularly helpful, in view of the considerable interest in Parliament, if I could make my statement during theSecond Reading of the Bill on Friday, 22nd November.Conclusions15.     In summary I invite my colleagues to agree that:-(a) the immediate problem of the Central Regionshould be tackled by the provision of some 3 million to cover the purchase of anadditional 350, 000 acres (paragraph 7 above);(b) that the review of the schemes&apos; operation should be brought forward to the spring of next year;  and(c) that I should make a statement in parliament on the Second Reading of the KenyaIndependence Bill.D.S.Colonial Office, S.W. 1.19th November, 1963
AN APPRECIATION BY THE DIEECTOE OP INTELLIGENCEON THE SECURITY SITUATION IN THE NYANDARUADISTRICT OP THE CENTRAL REGION tilTH particular reference TO LAND SETTLEMENT,Since the start of the settlement schemes in Nyandaruadistrict, 2,392 Kikuyu families (some 12,000 persons) have been settled on land acquired &quot;by the Settlement Board.     Of these,2,192 families (some 11,000 persons) have been settled on&quot;high density&quot; schemes at Kipipiri, vVanjohi, Malowa, Njabiniand 01 Kalou, where each occupies a holding of 7 to 10 acres.A further 200 families (about 1000 persons) have taken upholdings on the &quot;low density&quot; scheme at Bundori, where eachoccupies between 50 and 70 acres.     The &quot;low density&quot; settlersare a class apart from the others in that they qualified fortheir holdings by a down-payment of  250 cash and were required to possess a certain knowledge of farming.2,     The process of settlement, while increasing the numberof people on the land by some 12,000, appears to havedisplaced more than twice this number.      Those displaced arenot only those who were working on the farms when they were taken over by the Settlement Board, but those illegallyresident on the farms when they were bought.     It is notpossible to state accurately the figure of those displaced,the illegal squatter community having increased considerablysince 1961, but the current estimate is 6000 families,representing (on the basis of k or 5 to a family) some 25,000Kikuyu,     A very large number of these people are now landless,homeless and unemployed, and still in the district.3.     Approximately 1,700 families (8,500 persons) have beenabsorbed as &quot;Interim Settlers&quot; on 2 acre plots (per family) atMkungi, Kipipiri and Nel&apos;s farm^ from where they are to heplaced on permanent settlements as soon as possible.     However,less than 10 per cent are expected to be settled by the endof the year.     This will leave some 7i&quot; thousand Kikuyu(men, women and children) biding their time on what are barelysubsistence plots.     They are becoming increasingly impatientand frustrated, and it is clear that the holding of such large numbers of people on the &quot;interim schemes&quot;, from whichthe clearance rate is visibly slow and the prospect of early,permanent settlement extremely poor, is a cause of frustrationthat is daily becoming more serious.k.     Much the same can be said for another 271 families(some 1,350 persons) who failed to satisfy the necessaryqualifications for inclusion in the &quot;interim schemes&quot;.    these people are now living in a Transit Camp 5 miles from ThomsonsPalls which is intended to serve as a labour exchange, but fewcan expect to be found employment as many farmers are dis-charging redundant labour and few have any wish to increase their labour force.     The discontent which is present due tothe lack of employment prospect is aggravated by the knowledgeof those in the camp that there is little hope of land being found for any of them.ANNEX    IgQ
SECRET16!5.     While posing formidable economic, security and administra-tive problems of their own, the Interim Schemes and the transit Camp have not in any -way alleviated the hardships ofmore than half the estimated number of displaced persons inthe district.     Assuming the number of displaced to &quot;be in the region of 25,000, the Interim Schemes and Transit Camp combinedhave catered for less than 10,000, leaving the balance with no alternative but to squat illegally on European farms, totrespass or to steal.     They represent a potentially more serious hazard to security than those who are stagnating on the interim Schemes or in the Transit Camp.6.     In addition, it is estimated that 3*500 families (some17,000 persons) are still living on farms which have been boughtby the Settlement Board but not yet pegged for settlement.These people are no longer drawing wages.     Being dependent fortheir livelihood on their farm &quot;shambas&quot;, they will almost certainly have to be evicted in due course.     They are thenlikely to swell the ranks of the unemployed, as are some 5?000others who have become redundant on farms unaffected by theSettlement Schemes but who, for compassionate reasons, have been permitted to remain on the farms pro tern.     These two categoriesincrease the figure of unemployed in the district by anadditional 22,000 approximately, to which must be added an unknown number of Kikuyu who, in.recent months, have gravitatedtowards Nyandarua district in search of land or work, but ;found neither.     Excluding those on the &quot;interim schemes&quot; andin the Transit Camp, and assuming that some 10 per cent ofthose dispossessed have left the district in search of a livingelsewhere, the district is still estimated to contain some7,000 adult males and 27,000 others (aged, women and children)-who are now jobless.7.     Many European farmers are already plagued with illegalsquatters, and there is a danger of more Kikuyu coming to squaton the farms.     If they do it will be difficult to remove them,and failure to remove them would pose an additional problem for it could encourage a contempt for authority and possibly acomplete collapse of European morale, and with it the economy ofthe district.     As long as the inflow of Kikuyu exceeds the rateof settlement and employment, the security situation is likelyto deteriorate.     Already an atmosphere of disillusion orresentment has been created and this is causing crime and amost unhealthy attitude of mind in many parts of the district.Moreover, the eyes of thousands are turning to the European-owned farms.     Europeans who are still farming near theSettlement Schemes are considered by the &quot;have nots&quot; to beperpetuating the existence of &quot;white Highland&quot; blocks in ares which they desperately want for themselves.     No specific casesof European private land being illegally demarcated for occupation have yet been reported, but talk of taking overEuropean land if the landless are not given it soon is fairlygeneral.-5-
secret :       4 r- pJL h 08.      Since January this year, 137 cases of stock theftinvolving 975 head of stock have been reported,  the bulk ofthem having occurred since June.     So far this month 295head of stock (mainly sheep) have been stolen.     offences against property as a whole have increased since March, andthere have been a number of serious attacks on Europeanhomesteads along the Turasha ridge.      Crime is causing theEuropean farmers much concern, and this applies particularly to those farming near the Settlement Schemes, who have alsobeen the victims of many petty thefts and irritants, such asthe removal of their fencing posts for firewood by the newsettlers.      For Europeans to farm near the SettlementSchemes is becoming increasingly difficult, and any further deterioration could make the position of European farmersvirtually untenable.      Already a number who originally hoped to continue farming in the district have decided to go.9.     The notion that many more farms will be taken overafter Independence for the landless Kikuyu population has gonevery deep,  and may account for the difficulty being experiencedby those farmers who have tried to evict redundant labour.In June, July and August the Courts were hard worked with casesof trespass or illegal squatting, but after a nominal fine theoffenders either returned to their squatting abodes or took upresidence on adjacent farms.      Those who did comply witheviction orders invariably joined the ranks of the discontentedliving on abandoned farms or the farms of &quot;absentee&quot; or&quot;week-end&quot; farmers.10.    In the prevailing circumstances,  it is perhapssurprising that there has not been more subversive activity.So far this year only 8 oathings have been reported, the laston 5th August.     All occurred on European farms some distance from the Settlement Schemes.      However, two gangs, eachcontaining a number of known KLPA adherents, are committingcrimes against property.      In addition, many of the 107 localKLPA activists, who were listed as wanted when the specialoperations against the society were concluded in the districtat the end of 1962, are still believed to be in the district.The two gangs,  one 18 strong and led until July by NJUGUNA WAITEa KLPA leader who is now serving 10 years&apos;  imprisonment, andone 13 strong and led by another KLPA activist, MUNGAI KAMAU,are behind much of the more serious crime on the Turasha ridge.The local police have had considerable success in tracking down the gangs and bringing &quot;wanted&quot; KLPA adherents to book.Already this month 6 members of MUNGAI KAMAU&apos;s gang have beencaught (its strength was 19).      One of those arrested made astatement to the police in which he said that his leaderadministered a &quot;KAMAU MAITHORI&quot;  (Weeping Kamau) oath to him in September 1962, and that one of the motives for the gang&apos;sattacks on European property was to drive Europeans from theland.
11,    The conditions in the district at present are undoubtedlymaking it easier for the criminal and subversive elements to operate, while the task of the police is being madecorrespondingly more difficult.      It is locally believedthat had the Prime Minister, in his speech at 01 Kalou on13th August, not condemned subversion and lawlessness in soforthright a manner, the two gangs and the other KLFA remnantswould, &quot;by feeding on the economic plight of the landless andunemployed, have managed to create a bigger security problemthan that which now exists.      It does not appear at presentthat the bulk of the population is in sympathy with the KLPAelement, nor that oathing or like activity on any scale isimminent.      However, this does not mean that if the economiccoiiditions deteriorate the position could not change suddenly.Nor does it mean that the &quot;have-nots&quot; are any less anxiousto take over private European land by using the methods whichthe KLPA have long advocated.12.   An organisation called the &quot;KAMAU MAITHORI&quot;  (WeepingKamau) was first heard of in February this year when reports from South Kinangop spoke vaguely of its members being activebetween South Kinangop and Kiambu.      It was said then that thesociety comprised a number of KLPA members who had pledgedthemselves to punish those who had defected or helped theGovernment.      Nothing further was heard of the society untilJuly when letters were received by three Kikuyu in Nyandaruadistrict,  all marked &quot;KAMAU MAITHORIi; .     These threatened tosew up the mouths and eyes of the recipients who were accused of having betrayed the tribe.     Two had been posted at Nakuruand one at North Kinangop.      It is suspected that NJUGUNA WAITE(Paragraph 10) wrote tv/o of the letters, but this it has notbeen possible to prove.13.    Later in July, at the Leshau Transit Camp inNyandarua, villagers who had been chased by a gang of fivemen described the gang as &quot;KAMAU MAITH0RI&quot;.     A similardescription was given by local Kikuyu to those responsible forburning down a shop at Dundori during the same month.NJUGUNA WAITE was arrested following a theft which occurred atthis shop shortly before it was burnt down, and his followersare suspected of having been responsible for the burning.This and the statement that one of the gang leaders administereda &quot;KAMAU MAITHORI&quot; oath last year,  indicates that the legendof &quot;KAMAU MAITHORI&quot; springs from the two gangs now active inNyandarua.      That the legend is something of a curiosity maybe gauged from the sudden appearance at Thomsons Fallshospital on 15th September of approximately 1,000 Kikuyu,who said they had come to get a glimpse of &quot;KAMAU MAITHORI&quot;having heard that its leader was there.     The following day astream of Kikuyu called at the local police station for thesame purpose.-7-
lk.    It is considered that special and immediate measures are necessary to alleviate the dangerous position \?hich isarising in Nyandarua district.     In the economic plight of thethousands of Kikuyu,  the casting of covetous eyes at Europeanfarms, the frustration caused &quot;by the slow progress of settlement,the activities of the two gangs, the illegal squatter problem and the problem of redundant labour, are all the ingredients for serious trouble in the months ahead.     The small-holdings whichwere planned to he viable units suitable for one family are in danger of becoming slum-like subsistence 1shambas&apos; occupied bya number of families and hangers-on.     There is also the danger that the &quot;Yeoman farmers&quot; occupying the 50 to 70 acre plots inthe low density areas will soon find themselves in a most difficult position.     Because they were able to put down  250for their holdings,  it is being said that they deserved noland at all.    They are being labelled &apos;&apos;Black Settlers&quot; and are becoming increasingly worried by rumours that the landless willdeprive them of their holdings after independence, and by thelegend of the &quot;KAIviAU MAITH0EI&quot;.     A mass encroachment of illegalsquatters onto European farms could create a land-grabbingprecedent which would disrupt settlement planning elsewhere, anda major breakdown of the whole structure and economy of the area.Special Branch Headquarters,NAIROBI.28th October, 196-8-
