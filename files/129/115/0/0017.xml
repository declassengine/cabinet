THE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF THEBRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATIONI.-introduction. The Corporation^ 1961-62 accounts showed a gross accumulated deficit at 31st March, 1962, on Profit and Loss account of  67,293,8380.) In1962-63 a further loss of  12,860,444 was incurred, bringing the gross accumu-lated deficit to  80,154,2820). The deficit has built up in the accounts overthe six years ended 31st March, 1963.2. Forecasts for the future suggest that further losses are inevitable. Thefinal total, indeed, will be well over  100 million. This is a formidablefigure and Parliament is entitled to ask how these losses have arisen. Thepurpose of the White Paper is to answer this question by setting out the factsabout the losses. Inevitably, therefore, it concentrates on the defects of theCorporation rather than on its merits. It does not seek to present an overallpicture of the Corporation^ achievement. It seeks simply to provideParliament with the necessary background information against which to judge the Government&apos;s proposals.3. The White Paper has drawn on correspondence and exchanges betweenthe Ministry and the Corporation. These include the detailed discussions in 1961-62 following publication of the White Paper on the Financial andEconomic Obligations of the Nationalised IndustriesO). It has taken accountof the two Reports of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries inMay, 1959 and February, 1962, and of the Annual Reports of the Cor-poration. The opinions of a number of independent persons with experienceof civil aviation have also been sought.4. Furthermore the Government have had the assistance and advice ofMr. John Corbett, a senior partner of the firm of Messrs. Peat, Marwick,Mitchell &amp; Co. He was appointed by the Minister of Aviation in October,1962, to inquire into the organisation, policy and prospects of the Cor-poration and to advise him on such changes as might be required to place it on a sound financial basis.5. Mr. Corbett was authorised to appoint management consultants toundertake special studies of certain areas of the Corporations activities.Associated Industrial Consultants Limited were appointed to investigate the Engineering and Maintenance Department; Messrs. Urwick Orr andPartners to examine the marketing organisation in the United Kingdom and europe; and a report on the Financial Comptrollers division (chosen as a sample of the Corporation^ headquarters organisation) was commissionedfrom the separate management consultancy firm of Messrs. Peat, Marwick,Mitchell &amp; Co. These three supplementary reports have been made availableto the Government.0) Before taking account of a capital reserve of  2,737,606 f thi? r^ma^&quot;M Before taking account of a capital reserve of  3,011,417 j    Sfi So3    P(3) Cmnd 1337 dated April 19615
6. Mr. Corbetf s report was commissioned on the basis that it would beconfidential. Much of the evidence on which it was based was given onthe clear understanding that it would be treated as confidential. It istherefore not intended to publish the report.7. The report has done much to complete the information available tothe Government and to shed light on some of the more controversial passages in the Corporation^ recent history.8. The Governments proposals for the future will be the subject of aseparate statement and are thus outside the scope of this White Paper.II. GENERAL9.

10. 1956 has been adopted as the starting point for this review of thework of the Corporation because: (a) the whole of the present accumulated deficit has emerged since then ;(6) the management of the Corporation was then reorganised;(c) the workfs airlines were then beginning to place orders for the bigAmerican jet aircraft.11. Any allocation of losses to particular causes must to some extent bearbitrary. For convenience, however, boac&apos;s deficit can best be studiedunder the following main heads losses on aircraft, with special referenceto the charges for amortisation and interest; losses from aircraft development costs ; losses from investments in associated and subsidiary companies ; lossescaused by political and economic factors ; defects in operating efficiency,organisation and administration.12. The table in paragraph 9 analyses the total losses under some ofthese headings. The extent to which they are attributable to special economicand political factors and to defects of organisation cannot be preciselycalculated.III. LOSSES ON AIRCRAFT13. Modern aircraft are very expensive. The Corporation^ Comet TVand Britannia 312 aircraft, for example, cost over  1 million each, excludingspares and ancillary equipment. A modern long range jet costs well over 2 million. Keen international competition has forced the world&apos;s airlinesinto a race for better and faster aircraft. This has placed a heavy burdenof capital charges on international aviation even on those airlines whichare content to follow where others lead. The burden has been exceptionally heavy on BOAC for reasons which are dealt with later in this section.14. Since 1956 BOAC has spent about  150 million on new aircraft.Over the seven years ending March, 1963, interest and fleet amortisationcharges alone (including the additional amortisation of  32 million chargedin the 1961-62 accounts) have averaged about  16 million a year, a largeelement in the total expenditure of the Corporation.15. Before examining the bearing of capital costs on boac&apos;s losses,it may be as well to explain how the Corporation finances its capital.The Financing of boac&apos;s Orders for Aircraft16. Like other nationalised industries, the Air Corporations resort to.the Exchequer for the long term capital they need to supplement their internal resources. Since 1956, new capital has been advanced to the Cor-porations under Section 42 of the Finance Act 1956 and Section 3 of theAir Corporations Act 1962 in the form of loans from the Minister. thus a relationship has been established between the Minister and the Cor-porations of banker and client. The Minister has no express statutory control over the Corporations&apos; capital expenditure, but in practice theyseek his approval and that of the Treasury for orders of new aircraft.As lender he is primarily concerned with the economic justification for thenumber of aircraft required. But other considerations of government policy are also properly brought to bear on the proposal through the medium of the Transport Aircraft Requirements Committee and throughcommunication between the Corporations and Government Departments,7&apos;
im7j The initiative for proposing a new aircraft and the choice of air-craft type rest with the Corporations. It is for the Corporations, in theexercise of their commercial judgment, to decide whether to order a par-ticular type and where, to order it, subject to whatever restrictions may bein force as to the ordering of aircraft, from abroad. In general it has.been the aim of Governments and Corporations alike that requirements should be met as far as possible from British sources.18. Government lending has taken the form of fixed interest bearingloans repayable over seven years. The rate of interest reflects that paidby the Government for borrowings over a comparable period at the timeof the loan. Thus the rates of interest on particular loans vary accordingto the dates when they were made (for example, interest on Exchequeradvances to BOAC currently outstanding varies from 4f per cent to 6  percent). Before 1956, the Corporations raised capital under Sections 8 to 10of the Air Corporations Act, 1949, by Treasury guaranteed stocks whichwere taken up by the National Debt Commissioners. Interest remains payable on all the outstanding borrowed capital which by 31st March, 1963, amountedin the case of BOAC to  168-5 million this figure includes the  80 million gross accumulated deficit. As shown in the table in paragraph 9 of this white Paper, some  34 million of the Corporation^ total accumulated deficit of  80 million is attributable to such interest.The Problem of Amortisation19. Capital assets in any business must earn enough over and abovethe cost of operating them to cover their capital cost, less their ultimatedisposal value. Otherwise a loss is incurred when they are withdrawn from service. The Air Corporations allocate substantial annual sums from revenue to provide for this amortisation of their aircraft and other assets. in calculating the minimum amounts to be set aside for amortisation BQACdecided in 1957 to assume that (i) the useful life of its new aircraft would be seven years, and(ii) if disposed of after seven years, they would realise 25 per cent of their original cost.These provisions have proved inadequate in the case of its DC7C, Britanniaand Comet IV* aircraft. The Britannia 102 and some of the DC7C aircraft have already been withdrawn from service after an average of less than five years service per aircraft. Nearly half the accumulated deficit (some 35 million) is attributable to losses on aircraft, either because of a shorterexpectation of life or a loss on disposal.20. A small portion of the  35 million capital loss on aircraft was dueto Tudor, Hermes and Comet I aircraft. All of these entered service before1953. The major portion, amounting to  32 million, is accounted for by theDC7C, Britannia 102 and 312 and Comet IV* aircraft which have enteredservice since 1956. These losses can be put down to three main causes:the consequences of the disasters which befell the Comet I; the technical* This is not the improved Comet IV B now in service with BEA or the Comet IV Cwhich is still in production.
troubles which delayed both marks of Britannia, in particular with icingand the electrical system; and the widespread introduction of the bigAmerican jets on the long haul routes.21. The Corporation^ long term planning for the 1950s had been basedon Comet and Britannia aircraft. The middle of the decade, however,saw the Comet I programme disrupted, and the introduction of the Britanniadelayed: the Corporation was thus left operating a mixture of Argonauts,Constellations and Stratocruisers. Some of these had been bought hurriedlysecond-hand. Others were retained in service after their planned retirementdates.22. The Comet I disaster in 1953-54 caused the Corporation an immediatecapital loss, but the effect went beyond this. The Corporation had showngreat enterprise and initiative in supporting this first pure jet long rangecommercial aircraft. There seemed every chance that it would successfullyexploit the lead which Britain then enjoyed in the development of the jetengine. The introduction of the Comet I in 1952 led immediately toan increase in the Corporation^ traffic. In 1952-53, for example, theaverage passenger load factor for other aircraft on Eastern and SouthAfrican services was about 63 per cent. The Comet I&apos;s load factor averaged87 per cent. Unrivalled prospects of prosperity lay ahead. But with thedisasters to the Comet I the promised traffic increase melted away. TheCorporation had to buy aircraft off the shelf at high prices. These hadlimited passenger appeal. The Corporation lost its lead over its competitors.It had to start planning all over again.23. Not only did the Corporation stake its money on the pure jetComet I. It also backed the lead which the British aircraft industrythen had in the development of commercial aircraft powered by thepropeller-turbine. There was considerable expert support at the timein the United States as well as in the United Kingdom for the viewthat the large turboprop aircraft had an assured future, due mainly toits low operating costs. The success of the Viscount lent some support to this view. In the United States it found expression in the developmentof the Electra ; in this country in the development of the Britannia.24. BOAC accordingly placed orders for Britannia s to be delivered in 1954-55, but the introduction of a long range version so early in theproduction line, technical troubles and the additional structural testingrequirements as a result of the Comet I disaster delayed them by some two and a half years. If the Britannia had come into full service at thetime the Corporation had planned, it might have had several years ofprofitable operation before losing its passenger appeal to the pure jets.Instead, as an insurance against delay in the delivery of the Britannia 312,designed primarily for the North Atlantic routes, the Corporation in1955 ordered ten DC7C piston-engined aircraft to maintain its north atlantic services. This proved to be a costly expedient. When at last,at the end of 1957, the Britannia 312 was introduced into service on theNorth Atlantic it was only a year ahead of the long range pure jetsordered by boac&apos;s chief competitors. These soon attracted traffic away from the slower turboprop aircraft. Thus the reward of pioneering a new british aircraft again eluded the Corporation.9
25. By 1959 the Corporation could already perceive something of theultimate effect of these events on the working life and disposal valueof its fleet, particularly of its piston-engined aircraft. A note of warningwas added to the 1958-59 accounts that the book value of certain aircraft might be in excess of their realisable value on disposal. But the full effect was not revealed until 1961-62 when the Profit and Loss accountincluded a sum of nearly  32 million in respect of additional amortisation.This had to be added to the accumulated deficit..26. How did it come about that the full extent of the losses wasnot revealed sooner? This question has an important bearing on thegrowth of the accumulated deficit as shown in the annual accounts, onthe management of the Corporation and on its relationship with the Govern-ment.27. When addressing the House of Commons on the Second Reading ofthe Air Corporations Bill on 6th November, 1962, the Minister of aviation, speaking of the fall in the capital value of the aircraft fleetas disclosed in boac&apos;s 1961-62 accounts, said:  &quot; What I cannot accept so easily is that the depreciation in thevalue of the Corporation^ aircraft fleet has only been fully revealedthis year. This is not a situation which has come upon us in the night. It has been building up for two or three years past, and inany business efficient management must call for a clear understanding and a clear presentation of the balance sheet.&quot;28. This statement gave rise to some controversy in Parliament and inthe Press. In particular it has been suggested that in 1959 the Ministerof Transport and Civil Aviation prevented the Corporation from writingdown the capital value of its DC7C aircraft in the way it wished.29. The Air Corporations Act, 1949, empowers the Minister, with theapproval of the Treasury, to give directions as to the form of the Cor-porations&apos; accounts. The Corporations accordingly submit their accountsto the Minister each year in advance of publication so that the minister may approve the form. The Minister has no power to tell the Corporationswhat amounts they should include in the accounts. It is with mattersof form not substance that the Minister must properly be concerned.30. It is relevant to the consideration of the Ministers part in the dis-cussions on the 1958-59 accounts, that in 1957 the auditors of the twoCorporations had drawn up, at the request of the Chairmen and for theinformation of the Minister, a statement of the principles which they recommended for the future treatment of amortisation. The auditorsrecommended, among other things, that aircraft should be written downto their estimated disposal value by equal annual instalments spread overthe estimated life in the service of the Corporation of the aircraft. Theyadded, however, that these annual instalments or rates of amortisation shouldbe reviewed and adjusted from time to time in the light of the changingvalues and the changing expectation of life of the aircraft. These are familiar principles but in the light of the public interest which has been raised by this question, the full auditors&apos; statement is attached at Annex I.This statement was approved by the two Chairmen and endorsed by theMinister as a basis for future practice.
31. The approach which BOAC made in its proposals for the 1958-59accounts was concerned with two aspects of the subject:(a) the wish to record the much reduced value of the DC7C fleet which,according to the Corporation^ estimate, stood at  6-5 million over its true value ; and(b) the method of doing this.The method proposed by the Corporation was to show the reductionin value of the aircraft as a deduction from capital borrowings or alterna-tively as an item on the asset side of the balance sheet under the heading&quot; Lost Capital Account&quot;. The Minister took the view that neither ofthese methods was acceptable. Both methods would have carried a clear implication that the Government had agreed to write off the accumu-lated deficit, and this could not be done without legislation. The Ministerinvited the Corporation to reconsider the position in consultation with itsauditors and to put forward revised proposals.32. The next draft submitted by the Corporation was in the form inwhich the accounts were finally presented. The proposal to write down the value of the DC7C aircraft by  65 million was abandoned. Insteadthe potential losses on these aircraft were mentioned in Note 8 in the published accounts for 1958-59, as follows :  &quot; In the light of information as to prevailing market conditions inrespect of certain aircraft fleet planned for withdrawal from regularservice during 1960, it is possible that the book value of such fleetmay exceed its then realisable value. As the aircraft in question arestill in service, no provision has been made in these accounts for any consequential and possibly substantial deficit which may emerge if and when such realisation is effected.&quot;33. Amortisation continued to be charged in the 1958-59 accounts onthe basis of a 25 per cent residual value and seven year life as in the two previous years. No proposal was made for adjusting the rates on theDC7C or other aircraft. In the two years 1959-60 and 1960-61 the Cor-poration continued to charge the same rate of amortisation on its aircraft.34. It is difficult to say by how much the charge should have been increased, especially in the earlier years. It would be wrong to assume that the full extent of the additional amortisation charges which had tobe made in the 1961-62 accounts could have been foreseen when theDC7C, Britannia and Comet IV aircraft were first introduced into service.The economic lives of these aircraft have been materially shortened bythe unexpectedly quick development of the big jet aircraft and the sub-stantial increase in the number of airfields from which it can operateeconomically. The position was also aggravated by the unexpected pausein traffic growth in 1961. Nevertheless by 1959, if not earlier, it shouldhave been obvious that the rate of amortisation which was being chargedin the accounts was entirely inadequate.35. The Minister has no responsibility for determining the appropriateprovisions for amortisation. Looking back, however, it would haveremoved any possibility of misunderstanding if it had been made clear113,1105 A 5
to the Corporation at the time, that the Ministers criticisms of the formin which the Corporation proposed to write down the DC7C aircraft in the 1958-59 accounts did not absolve the Corporation from adhering to the principles agreed by the auditors of the tv/o Corporations. these principles provided for reviewing the rates of amortisation at frequent intervals and for making appropriate adjustments in the Profit and Lossaccount. It is, however, relevant to observe that in a letter addressed tothe Chairmen of the Corporations, the Minister had earlier said :&quot;With regard to the application of these principles, I accept withsome reluctance your proposal that, as a minimum, new aircraft shouldbe written off over seven years to a value of 25 per cent of cost asfrom 1956-57. I myself believe that in future years it would be prudent to make more substantial provision ; we cannot assume thatthe present high level of prices for second-hand aircraft will continue indefinitely and if, as a result of sudden decline in prices, you foundyourselves burdened with substantial unamortised sums, you wouldbe at a disadvantage compared with your competitors, many of whomwrite their assets down more quickly than you propose to do.&quot;(April 1957)IV-DEVELOPMENT COSTS36. When an airline introduces a new type of aircraft into service it has to spend a substantial amount on such activities as training aircrew,carrying out route proving flights, adapting its engineering and mainten-ance departments, and providing ground equipment and spares along thewhole length of the routes to be covered. It also has to meet the interest onthe capital cost of the aircraft before they come into full commercialservice. Between 1956 and 1962 the Corporation introduced five different types of aircraft. At no time did it have less than four types in service.The pre-operational and training expenditure shown separately by theCorporation in its accounts for the six years ended 31st March, 1962,on DC7C, Britannia, Comet IV and Boeing 707 aircraft amounted to nearly  13 million. Of this,  5 million was written off as a special item in 1958-59,  4-2 million has been written off in annual instalments andthe balance of  3-8 million (of which all but  1 million related to Boeing 707aircraft) was carried forward at 31st March, 1962, for future amortisation.37. Teething troubles are inevitable with new types of aircraft. these may set back traffic and damage goodwill. An example from past experi-ence is the interruption of Britannia services caused by the icing troublesof the Proteus engine. The effect of such difficulties on the Corporation^operating results cannot be measured, but it must have been considerable.38. The Corporation^ experience has been that relatively more pre-operational training and development expenditure has been incurred onits British aircraft than on its American aircraft. This is because with british aircraft the Corporation has normally been the first operator.39. The Corporation could reduce development costs if it adopted the safebut unadventurous course of flying only proven aircraft pioneered by others.
Such a policy may be unavoidable for the smaller airlines for whom the risks and problems of flying new types would be overwhelming. BOAC,however, remains the second largest international long haul airline in theworld. Its success must largely depend not only on standards of safety,reliability and passenger comfort where there is not much to choose betweenthe best airlines but on being first in the air with new aircraft of higherperformance and increased passenger appeal. It is moreover a considerable advantage to an airline as BEA&apos;s experience with the Viscount has shown to have an aircraft designed to meet its own requirements. The corporation should not therefore be criticised for following the more adventurous path,even though so far, largely through ill-luck, it has experienced more of thedisappointments than the benefits of pioneering.V.-ASSOCIATED AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES40. The Air Corporations Act, 1949, gives the Air Corporations expresspower to acquire or to take an interest in any undertaking constituted for thepurpose of providing air services. Although they have no legal obligationto do so, it is the long-: landing custom of the Corporations to inform theMinister in advance of any major proposals affecting their relations withsubsidiary and associated companies. This arrangement enables the Ministerand the Corporations to exchange views on the matter and enables the corporations to take account of advice and information from official sourceson political and economic aspects of investment in the particular region.41. During the last fifteen years BOAC has held investments in a numberof airline companies operating local and regional services in various parts ofthe world. Since 1957 such investments have been held by BOAC associated companies Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary company of BOAC.42. The accumulated deficit arising from subsidiary and associated com-panies (other than BOAC-Cunard Ltd.) during the period from 1st April,1947, to 31st March, 1963, is calculated by the Corporation to be  14-million. About  13 million of this total deficit has arisen- during the seven years ended 31st March, 1963. The greater part of it is accounted for by thefollowing five companies:British West Indian Airways LimitedBahamas Airways LimitedMiddle East Airlines     ......Mid-East Aircraft Service CompanyKuwait Airways ...... m.4-71-73-01-51-412-other contributory elements are as follows : mBrought forward       ......... 12-3Operating losses of other associated and subsidiary companies 0-administration   ..................... 0-5Provision for prospective loss on disposal of Viscount aircraft 1-0Total    ............... 14-6
43. BOAC first acquired its interests in Bahamas Airways Ltd. andBritish West Indian Airways Ltd. in 1949, when it absorbed the British south american Airways Corporation (BSAA). The Ministry of Civil Aviationhad earlier been in continuous touch with BSAA regarding its negotiationswith these airlines, and it is clear that BSAA&apos;s participation in both receiveda good deal of official encouragement. It appears, however, that BSAA itselfhad a commercial interest in coming to an arrangement with these airlines andthat it did so in the exercise of its commercial judgment. These eventsoccurred some sixteen years ago. In contrast, the commitments in regard toKuwait were undertaken by BOAC at the express request of the Government,and the Minister authorised the Corporation to record this in its annual report for 1958-59. Apart from Kuwait, the other investments seem to havebeen undertaken in the genuine belief that they would promote the Corpora-tion&apos;s commercial interests.44. The Corporation^ motive for investing in local airlines has been tosecure feeder traffic for the main trunk services and to protect transit and traffic rights. It is not easy to assess how far this policy has been successful.In several parts of the world, competition has been fended off. e.g. the carribbean, Malaya, Bahrain, Kuwait and East and Central Africa. on balance, however, it seems likely that effort and money have been spent inchasing illusory benefits and warding off dangers that were potentially lesscostly than the investments involved.45. It is only fair to record that these investments have favoured the saleof British aircraft to some of the associated and subsidiary companies. Butthis has brought no corresponding advantage to the Corporation.46. Even if the Corporation^ policy of investing in associated and sub-sidiary companies overseas was justifiable as a means of securing commercialadvantages, the execution of this policy has been defective. The Corpora-tion appears to have given little consideration to estimating the value to it of any particular&apos; company before an investment was made, not only fromthe viewpoint of the capital required, but also in calculating the maximumloss which the company could sustain without eliminating all advantages tothe Corporation. For many years losses exceeded budget forecasts. Butthere is little evidence that it took effective action to reduce the rate of loss.It was often claimed that the value of the feeder traffic was one of the advan-tages derived from the associated and subsidiary companies but, until recently, the Board of BOAC had no recorded estimates of the extent ofthis traffic. In the same way, although it was feared that revenue might be lost if a particular associate became controlled by a competitor, no attempt was made, or at least recorded, to assess the financial consequences of sucha development.47. BOAC Associated Companies Ltd. was formed in September, 1957,with the object of improving the Corporation^ control and management of its overseas investments. But when the Select Committee on nationalised industries considered the Corporations affairs in 1959, it noted that thenew arrangement had not so far produced any good results.48. Within the last two or three years positive steps have been takento reduce the Corporation^ commitments in associated and subsidiary
companies and to exercise better management control over those that were retained.   In particular:(i) the shares in Middle East Airlines have been sold and Mid-EastAircraft Service Company has been virtually wound up;(ii) the Corporation has disposed of all but a 10 per cent interestin British West Indian Airways Limited ;(iii) the agreement with Kuwait Airways came to an end on 31st May,1963, and is not being renewed.49. It was inevitably a slow and painful process for the corporation to extricate itself from some of its overseas investments even when it became clear that they were unlikely ever to be profitable. Some advan-tages, however, have been retained. For example, boac&apos;s relationship with British West Indian Airways Limited remains cordial and both are associated with the Jamaican national airline. The relationship withMiddle East Airlines and with Kuwait Airways also remains cordial, and orders for British aircraft have resulted from the confidence in british types built up during the period of association with the Corporation.The investments in Borneo Airways, Fiji Airways, Gulf Aviation, MalayanAirways and Aden Airways are currently profitable, and the Corporationdeserves its share of the credit for this success.50. Nevertheless it is fair to conclude that the losses of about  13 million over the seven years ending March, 1963, would have been very much less if (i) the purpose of each investment had been more clearly defined ;(ii) the benefits which it was expected to generate had been more carefully weighed against the costs involved ; and(iii) expenditure, particularly in the earlier years, had been properlycontrolled.BOAC-Cunard Limited51. An account of boac&apos;s associated and subsidiary companies wouldnot be complete without mention of BOAC-Cunard Limited.52. BOAC and the Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. had discussed cooperationover a period of years. Discussions were initiated in 1954 by the two Chair-men with a view to establishing closer cooperation between the two dominantBritish carriers on the North Atlantic in the broad national interest, butprogress was slow. In 1957 an agreement was reached to cover pre-bookedair/sea passages, unpremeditated transfers and commissions. This, however,did little more than to put into formal terms the informal arrangements,mainly in connexion with accounting procedure, already in force. A fullair/sea agreement to cover circle and round trip air/sea bookings becameeffective in July, I960,53. In mid-1960 the Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. acquired a controlling interest in Eagle Airways Ltd. (thereafter known as Cunard Eagle AirwaysLtd.) and thus put itself in a position to compete with BOAC, particularlyin respect of the Gulf Stream service (United Kingdom/Bermuda/Nassau/Florida) and Skycoach services to the West Atlantic.  In 1961 Cunard Eagle
Airways obtained a licence from the Air Transport Licensing Board to operate trans-Atlantic services to the United States but this was revokedby the Minister of Aviation in November, 1961, after an appeal hearing.Shortly thereafter, Cunard Eagle announced that its Gulf Stream service would be operated by its Bermudan registered Boeing 707 aircraft. by may, 1962, BOAC and Cunard had agreed in principle on the form of collaboration which led to the formation of BOAC-Cunard Ltd. in June,1962. boac&apos;s aim seems to have been to avoid possible loss from theGulf Stream service and from any service for which Cunard Eagle might in future be able to obtain licences ; they also had in mind the gains tobe achieved from a full and economic use of the resources and experienceof both enterprises. The agreement did not require the formal consentof the Government, but it was referred by the parties to the then Ministerof Aviation. He took the view that it might well be of benefit to british civil aviation in the important area concerned.54. BOAC-Cunard Ltd. has an authorised equity capital of  30 million,to be taken up by BOAC and the Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. in the ratio 7 : 3.The function of the Company is to provide air services (both passenger and cargo, scheduled and non-scheduled) to, from and within the &quot;agreedarea&quot;, defined as the United States east of 100&quot; W, Mexico, central america, Gulf and Caribbean, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela andBritish Guiana.55. The capital so far issued (about  28 million) has been mainlyprovided by the transfer to the new Company of eight Boeing 707 aircraft by BOAC and two Boeing 707 aircraft by the Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd.(being aircraft previously owned by Cunard Eagle Airways Ltd.). Cunard&apos;contribution has been supplemented by a cash payment. The workingarrangement is that all ten aircraft are leased by the Company to BOACwhich has integrated them with the rest of its fleet and sells flying hours to the Company at a price to cover full costs.56. The agreement also provided for the new Company to acquire fromBOAC the whole of the issued capital of Bahamas Airways Ltd. and fromCunard the whole of the issued capital of Cunard Eagle (Bahamas) Ltd.and Cunard Eagle (Bermuda) Ltd.57. Since the incorporation of the Company, developments have included the integration of BOAC and Cunard sales offices in fifteen cities in theUnited States, cruises to the Caribbean by Cunard involving air/sea book-ings and the scheme for the Company and British West Indian Airwaysto be associated with the Jamaican national airline.58. boac&apos;s accounts for the year ending March, 1963, show a totaldeficit of  1,063,281 in respect of BOAC-Cunard Ltd.&apos;s operations since its incorporation on 20th June, 1962 (including a loss of  356,012 in respectof Bahamas Airways Ltd.); of this total BOAC bore 70 per cent ( 744,297).The effect of the arrangement on boac&apos;s finances will depend on whetheroperations in the defined area become profitable and on the extent to whichthe collaboration of these two big British enterprises facilitates economies in operation and additional sales.
&apos; :   VI.  POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS    a   anoo .Loss oft the Cabotage Routes and the Growth of Competition59. In the early post-war years BOAC was in a strong position, To theeast and to the south the geographical spread of the Commonwealth formed the basis of its route network. Competition from foreign carriers was cqm-paratively slight. Traffic to Australia and to East, Central and&apos; SouthAfrica was shared solely with boac&apos;s Commonwealth partners. TheCorporation had a virtual monopoly of traffic between the United Kingdomand West Africa. Not least important, traffic between the United Kingdomand points on the routes in colonial or protected territory (cabotage traffic)was reserved under established international practice to the Britishoperator. Across the Atlantic the Corporation had the advantage of being based on London, which in the days of shorter range aircraft also con-stituted a gateway for traffic coming from other points in Europe.    ibfiai60. In recent years many of these advantages have been reduced. Thenumber of airlines now competing for the traffic on boac&apos;s traditionalroutes has increased out of all proportion to the traffic growth. Newlyindependent territories have set up their own airlines, all claiming theright to a share of the traffic to and from their territories. Germany, Italyand Japan have also emerged as strong competitors.61. On the Eastern routes BOAC has continued to prosper in partner-ship with the Australian national airline, Qantas Empire Airways, andmore recently with Air India International. But even here competitionhas increased many times.62. On the African routes, a number of territories have emerged to full independence. As each territory has ceased to be a British dependency,so traffic to; and from the United Kingdom has ceased to be cabotagetraffic reserved to British airlines. Foreign competition has increased; as foreign governments have gained new rights from the emergent african countries. At the same time the expatriate traffic which had provided a regular flow to and from the United Kingdom, has declined sharply. Thisis a tendency which in some cases has been increased by politicaluncertainty and the consequent discouragement of new investment and themovement of people associated with capital developments. Competitionhas increased, but there has been no margin of growth to accommodate thenew entrants.63. The Corporation has made great efforts to adjust itself to this situation and has succeeded in safeguarding many of its interests. Inparticular it has co-operated in the development of the new Commonwealthairlines by going into partnership with them, often providing training andother forms of technical assistance. Nevertheless the overall effect of these developments has been to reduce the share of the traffic which the Corpora-&apos;&apos;tion&apos;can&apos;expect to attract&apos;.&apos;64. One result of the independence of the former colonial territorieshas been the loss of traffic rights to exchange with foreign governments for; the rights which the Corporation required from them to maintain itsroute structure.   Exchanges in traffic rights have in consequence been
concentrated at a diminishing number of points. This in turn has led to greater competition from foreign airlines at these points. Several new and powerful foreign entrants have, for instance, had to be admitted to both London and Hong Kong.Air Traffic Rights65. Air traffic rights are negotiated between Governments, and the. question arises whether the Government could have done more toprotect the Corporation against the effects of foreign competition. Manyof our agreements with foreign Governments on air traffic rights werenegotiated in the early years after the war when the industry was stillyoung and the great technological advances of the war were still relativelyunexploited by civil airlines. In those days we strove with the otherleading civil aviation countries to promote policies for the exchange oftraffic rights which would give the maximum freedom to the industry todevelop quickly and surely on a sound commercial basis. Rights weregiven liberally by the United Kingdom Government both at home and in colonial territories in the well-founded belief that they would therebyfoster the development of world services and encourage similarly liberalpolicies in the countries that lay on the main international routes. many countries were granted rights in United Kingdom territories for which com-pletely reciprocal benefits for British airlines were not obtained or expected.The rapid expansion of the industry shows the Tightness of this policyin the early years. More recently, however, as more airlines have entered the world routes and capacity increases have outrun traffic development,restrictive practices by foreign Governments have been on the increase.With BOAC exposed increasingly to the two pronged attack of increasedcompetition and restrictionism, it is right to ask how far in present daycircumstances Britain can afford to continue to grant traffic rights toairlines whose countries do not provide comparable benefits for Britishairlines. BOAC has pressed from time to time that some of the rightsnow enjoyed , by foreign airlines in British territory, should be reviewedto bring the exchange of traffic rights into better balance. Large issues are involved here which the Government have under constant review.Some adjustments have already been made and others may be necessary.BOAC and the British Independent Airlines66. Prior to the Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, 1960, the Air transport advisory Council recommended, and the Minister approved, the developmentof a certain number of scheduled services by the independent airlines.67. As a result certain independent operators built up, during the1950s, a network of routes serving the cabotage areas in Africa and the mid-Atlantic. ,This competition in the mid-Atlantic was brought to an endwhen in 1962 BOAC and the Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. collaborated toform BOAC-Cunard Ltd. (see paras. 51-58 above). In Africa the inde-pendent operators concerned were Hunting Clan and air work (both nowmembers of the Air Holdings Group). These two operators, on therecommendation of the Air Transport Advisory Council, operated ColonialCoach services i.e. services of a type not provided by BOAC, providing
cheap cabotage transport, generally with older type aircraft, and aimed atattracting travellers who would not have used boac&apos;s normal scheduled services. The subsequent introduction of Economy Class fares would have enabled BOAC to undercut the Colonial Coach fares. This would hardlyhave been fair to the independent operators since their Colonial Coachservices had built up new traffic. Accordingly the relationship betweenBOAC and the independent operators was reviewed in 1958-60, and anarrangement was arrived at whereby BOAC shared the Economy Classcapacity with them on a 70 : 30 basis and a limited number of Skycoachservices on a 50 : 50 basis.68. The Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act, 1960, abolished the statutorymonopoly of the Corporations and their associates in respect of scheduled services, and inaugurated a system under which any British operator,whether nationalised or independent, could apply to the new Air TransportLicensing Board for licences to operate air services of any kind.69. As mentioned in paragraph 53 above, in mid-1961 Cunard EagleAirways Ltd. obtained a licence from the Board to operate London/new york Services but BOAC successfully appealed to the Minister of Aviation,who in November, 1961, revoked the licence. The negotiations with theItalian authorities about the grant of rights for the British United Airwaysservice Oatwick/Genoa, resulted in a change in the conditions underwhich BOAC was allowed to operate through Rome, but the implications for boac&apos;s financial position are insignificant.Trooping70. It has been the policy of the present Government and itspredecessors since 1952 to limit the activities of the Air corporations in the charter field. Thus the Corporations were until recently discouragedfrom maintaining aircraft purely for charter work and the Governmenthas looked to the independent airlines to perform long term air troopingcontracts. The reasons behind this policy have been on the one handa feeling that, particularly in their early days, the Corporations should concentrate on the highly competitive task of operating world-widescheduled services, and on the other hand a desire to preserve a sector ofcivil aviation which would offer an outlet for the aspirations and enter-prise of the private companies. The desirability of modifying this policy to meet the changed situation created by the Licensing Act of 1960 is kept under review, but it will be some time yet before the new opportunitiesopened to the independent airlines can be properly assessed and no immediate change is foreseen. In the meantime the Corporations remainfree to compete for ad hoc trooping charters, of which BOAC has beensuccesful in securing a substantial number. The Corporations recentlyapplied unsuccessfully to the Air Transport Licensing Board for authorityto carry troops on scheduled services at rebated fares. It is fair that therestriction on trooping work should be remembered in comparing BOACsoperations with those of its competitors who have enjoyed a greater freedom in this field. On the other hand BOAC benefit more than mostof its competitors from the carriage of mail.
General71. BOAC at one time expected that expansion on the North Atlanticroutes would compensate it for loss of traffic on the traditional Common-wealth and colonial routes. But competition on the North Atlantic increasedsharply, partly as a result of the grant of traffic rights through the UnitedKingdom to foreign carriers. At the same time traffic growth slackenedpartly because of an increasing number of passengers between the UnitedStates of America and points in Europe, who previously staged throughLondon, now fly on direct jet services.72. The Corporation^ plans for expansion on the North Atlantic werein any case affected by the setback to traffic growth in 1961-62. All the major international airlines suffered from this setback ; but BOAC sufferedmore than most airlines because the decline in traffic came at a time whenthe cumulative effect of the political and economic changes in the post-war world were weighing most heavily on the Corporation.73. Between the calendar years 1960 and 1961 the world average passengerload factor on scheduled international services dropped from 58-8 per cent to 53-0 per cent, a drop of nearly six points. In 1962 it dropped further to 52-1 per cent. On the Corporation^ scheduled services the drop was from59-8 per cent to 49-6 per cent between 1960 and 1961, a fall of ten points,with a further fall to 47-6 per cent in 1962. The Corporation^ load factorthus fell to a level lower than that of the industry as a whole. Yet for years its load factor had been higher than the average.74. The Board of BOAC could hardly be expected to have foreseenthe full extent of the deterioration of its position over the last fewyears. The transformation of British colonial policy in Africa, forexample has taken place in less than the normal development cycleof a new aircraft. The time it takes to order, introduce into service, andamortise&apos;a new aircraft is indeed an element of rigidity in airline policy.At the same time, the trend had started to emerge at least five years ago,and against this background the rate at which BOAC continued to expandseems to have been unduly optimistic.VII-THE ROLE OF THE CORPORATION75. It is sometimes claimed that one of the factors leading to anexpansionist policy was an uncertainty in the mind of the Corporation as to how far it should regard itself as a purely commercial undertaking and howfar its role is that of a national flag carrier with considerations of publicservice and national prestige as a dominant motive. Any large enterpriseoperating in the international field must naturally take account of politicaland prestige considerations so far as these are relevant to its commercialoperations. BOAC inherited a strong tradition from the days of imperial airways that it was its duty to lead the world in civil avaition; nor has this sense of mission been discouraged by successive Governments.76. The impact of the Corporations&apos; activities on national policy leadsnaturally to close consultation between the Government and the Corporationson matters affecting the public interest. The Select Committee on National-ised Industries drew attention to &quot; the extent to which the Corporations tacitly
allow powers to the Minister which the statutes do not&quot;, and in other partsof this paper there will be found evidence of the interplay of government policy and of boac&apos;s commercial interest in relation to aircraft procure-ment and investment in associated and subsidiary companies.77. Nevertheless, cases where BOAC embarked on a course of actioncontrary to its own commercial judgment at the time and because theGovernment insisted on its doing so in the national interest have beenexceptional. During the years 1956 to 1963 there appear to be only two examples on record. The first was in 1957 when the Governmentrequested BOAC to take delivery of four Britarinias and make advancepayments to the Bristol Aeroplane Company. This was to give theCompany the necessary financial relief and breathing space to enable it to solve, as it eventually did, the technical problems that were holding up completion. The second, and more significant, examplewas the Corporation^ agreement for the management and operationof Kuwait Airways&apos; services with entitlement to a share of any profits and responsibility for losses. The agreement was negotiated in 1958and expired in May, 1963. While it lasted the Corporation sustainedlosses amounting to  1-4 million. BOAC was unwilling on commercialgrounds to enter into the agreement. The Government insisted that theCorporation should undertake this venture in order to help a friendly stateand authorised it to mention the circumstances in its next Annual Report.78. In both cases BOAC sought and obtained the Governments formal recognition that it was acting in the national interest. It seems to follow that BOAC was aware that this was the proper course for it to take in casesof this kind, and that if it had believed that similar considerations applied toother decisions, a similar arrangement would have been made. All thispoints to the conclusion that the Corporation should have been well aware that it was expected to operate as a commercial concern, and that if theGovernment wished it, in the national interest, to act contrary to itscommercial judgment, it was for the Government to issue instructionsaccordingly.79. It is significant that in 1952 the then Chairman of BOAC tookpains to imprint on the minds of his staff the idea that the Corporationwas essentially a commercial undertaking; that the financial aspect of every single activity mattered ; and that the ultimate test of the Corporation^success was not only the standard of public service it provided but also thenormal business criterion of whether it could be made to pay its way.0The Corporation may have inherited a tradition of expansion, but thereshould have been no uncertainty as to its role.(i) boac&apos;s Report for 1951/52 page 6.
VIII.-OPERATING RESULTS80. Of the total deficit accumulated over the last seven years,  28 million was due to the failure of the Corporation to earn enough of a surplus onOperating Account to cover interest on capital and other miscellaneouscharges. The figures were:   m  mOperating surplus............. 4-0Interest    ..................     27-miscellaneous charges and adjustments       ...       2-8Fleet insurance reserve............       2 0 31 8Difference    ............... 27-881. Could BOAC have turned this deficit into a surplus by betteradministration leading to increased sales or greater economies?82. Year by year the Operating Account figures and interest charges were as follows:  		Total		Surplus		Year ended	traffic	Total net	or	Interest	lilst March	revenue	expenditureia)	(Deficit)			 m	 m	 m	 m1957		48-6	46-5	2-1	1-11958		53-0	53-3	(0-3)	1-91959		57-9	57-1	0-8	2-91960	...            ...            .	70-5	66-2	4-3	4-01961	...            ...            .	88-0	83-7	4-3	4-71962		92-7	97-7	(5-0)	6-01963	.......	92-4(6)	95-1(6)	(2-2)(c)	6-4		503-1	499-6	4-0(c)	27-083. In a given year, once the operating programme is fixed, the revenueearned is very largely outside the control of the Corporation. The fares and freight rates are fixed by the International Air Transport Association (inwhich, of course, the Corporation has a voice). The Corporation^ traffic andload factors, though naturally influenced by the effectiveness or otherwise ofits sales effort and by the quality of its services, are largely governed by the overall volume of traffic, which may be subject to disturbance from economicand political trends, and by the competition it has to face from other air-lines. Its operating result therefore depends largely on the ability of manage-ment to keep expenditure down to the minimum and on its ability to makeadjustments to cope with unforeseen fluctuations in traffic.84. Much of the expenditure is outside the full control of the executivemanagement: for example, costs of fuel and materials. Other items, forexample, the charges for amortisation of fleet assets, are largely determined(a) Excluding additional amortisation charged to Profit and Loss Account in 1961/62.(b) Including BOAC-Cunard Ltd.(c) Excluding that part ( 0-5m.) of the deficit attributable to BOAC-Cunard Ltd. opera-tions.
by earlier investment decisions. It is, however, within the power of manage-ment to control the size of the staff, and the general efficiency and cost of theadministration.85. The main headings of operating expenditure in the year to 31stMarch, 1963, were: 	 m	per cent.Aircraft standing charges    .........	1065(a)	-    11-2Aircraft maintenance.......	21-37	22-5Flight operations       ...	23-78	,25-0Technical training and pre-operational costs	1-58	1-7Charter of aircraft and crews......	0-45	0-5Passenger service       ............	7-68	8-1Station and traffic costs     ......      ...	6-96	7-3 ;Sales, advertising and publicity (including		commission) ,:       ...             ,       , -,.	17-58	.   18-5Central administration      , ... ,   ...   ;  ...	4-36	4-6Net purchase of capacity   ...      ...	1-57  .	1-6Less incidental revenue       ...	-0-93	-1-0	95-1	100-0(The above figures include the operations of BOAC-Cunard Ltd.)86. Aircraft Maintenance is one of the largest cost groups. The total for 1962-63 of  214 million represents nearly one-quarter of the totaloperating expenditure. The staff costs of over  9 million under this headare nearly one-third of the total staff costs of  33 million. Mr. Corbett there-fore arranged for an investigation to be made into this section of theCorporation by Associated Industrial Consultants Ltd. There is further reference to this in Section IX below.87. Flight Operations is the largest single cost group at  23-8 million.Of this, fuel and oil costs ( 12-2 million) and landing fees and flight in-formation services ( 3 7 million) are determined by factors outside thecontrol of the Corporation. The balance of nearly  8 million is mainly forcrew pay and expenses. Crew numbers have been inflated by the multi-plicity of aircraft types in the Corporation^ service and by its complicatedroute pattern.88. Sales at  17-6 million is the next biggest cost group. This includes 5 million on commissions to the agents through whom a large proportionof the Corporation^ sales are made. The level of commission is fixedinternationally, and this cost is therefore largely outside the Corporation^control. Other selling costs (including  3-3 million on advertising and publicity and nearly  5 million on staff costs) are large elements of costs for all international airlines, and here the problem of management is to getthe best return for the expenditure made. As part of Mr. corbetts in-investigation, a report on certain aspects of the Corporation^ sales effort wascommissioned from Messrs. Urwick, Orr and Partners Ltd. There is further reference to this in Section IX below.(a) Excluding  6-65 million additional amortisation charged to Profit and Loss Account in1961/62.
89. Passenger Service and Station and Traffic Costs accounted for  7-7 million and  70 million respectively, of which  1-9 million and  40million were direct staff costs, and the remainder was for passenger meals,accommodation, transport and handling charges. In an industry where theprice of the product is fixed, it is very largely on the standards of serviceprovided on the ground and in the air that airlines rely to build up and maintain goodwill. .90. Central Administrative Costs ( 4-4 million including  3 million staffcosts) are a relatively small part of total expenditure, but they are, as inmost industries, a useful pointer to the general level of efficiency. Messrs.Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. accordingly studied the Financial Comp-troller&apos;s Division, which is responsible for more than a quarter of thetotal cost of the group. Their report is referred to in Section IX below.91. The Select Committee on Nationalised Industries made comparisons,in their Reports of 14th May, 1959, and 20th February, 1962, of the operatingresults of the Corporation and those of other leading international air-lines. A table bringing these figures up to date is at Annex II of this white Paper. boac&apos;s operating costs are probably as low as or lower than those of most of the European airlines on long-haul services, butdirect comparisons of the cost figures in the table are misleading becausethe European airlines&apos; figures cover not only long-haul operations likeBOACs but also those on the inherently much more expensive short-haulservices. A summary of the comparative costs of some mainly long-hauloperators is given below :[d. per capacity ton mile]Trans-WorldBOAC Pan Airlines        QdntdsAmerican   (Internationalroutes)1960.     ......     30-3 27-4       . 27-3 ,        28-21961       ...     ...     26-50)        23-4 28-7        , 24-1:.    1962.......     25-40)        21-2  .   .    20-7 23-4Differences in type and scale of operations and in the, aircraft operatedmake it difficult to compare like with like. For example, the level of anairline&apos;s average costs now depends very much on the proportion of Targejet aircraft in its fleet. The increasing use of these aircraft has been themain factor responsible for the large cost reductions shown in the above^figures, noiaairfunoy &apos;to lovol arit   .&amp;lsr/i mis ^Anv. y/noiiirroqioo aril ;ki92. So far as the revenue of the different airlines is concerned, the vary-ing extent to which they benefit from Government contracts for the carriage of troops and mail and for the performance of other services also; makesi comparisons unreliable. There is, in fact, no norm by which the; perform-ance of any single airline may be judged. Even so, the operating costs of other long-haul operators set a standard which cannot be ignored.(&quot;) The unit costs of 28 0d. and 26-0d. per c.t.m. for 1961/62 and 1962/63 shown inB.O.A.C.&apos;s 1962/63 Report reflect the additional depreciation charges attributable tp 1961/62and 1962/63 written off by a capital adjustment in 1961/62.
On the face of it, although boac&apos;s costs have come down, Pan american and Trans-World Airlines still appear to be able to operate at lower coststhan the Corporation. It is true that their fleets include a higher proportionof the more economic large jet aircraft but against this BOAC have theadvantage of lower wage rates. This at least raises the question whetherBOACs higher average costs result to some extent from weaknesses in organisation or management., ; IX. ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT93. It has not been thought necessary to investigate every aspect of the corporations work. As stated above, however, three special studies were carried out by professional consultants in the context of Mr. Corbetfsinquiry.   These concerned :(i) the engineering and maintenance division;(ii) the sales, advertising and publicity departments;(iii) the Financial Comptrollers division.The results of these studies are summarised below.Engineering and Maintenance Division94. There has never been any question about the high technical standardof the work carried out in boac&apos;s engineering and maintenance division,but its high costs have long been a cause of anxiety. As it employs alarge part of the Corporation^ labour force and accounts for nearly a quarter of the total annual expenditure, its efficiency has a critical effect onthe Corporation&apos;s trading results.95. In 1957 the Corporation arranged for an examination of the division^costs and organisation. The conclusion then arrived at was that the Cor-poration was employing on this type of work from 2\ to 5 times as manystaff per flying hour as its competitors. There appeared to be no com-compensating factors, such as differences in workshop equipment; to account for this disparity. It seemed to be mainly due to defects of organisation,procedures and management. These were aggravated by the difficulty of operating a fleet composed of several different types of aircraft and byunsatisfactory labour relations.96. The plans drawn up by the Corporation after the 1957 investigationproduced useful savings. Changes in the type and complexity of aircraft,in the age of the fleet and in the volume of output make precise comparisonsdifficult. But it is significant that between 1957-58 and 1962-63 there wasa reduction of over 20 per cent in the number of hours worked per flying hour.97. Nevertheless, the consultants who recently examined the division foundthat there still remained considerable scope for achieving further savings in cost without any danger of lowering the high technical standard of thework.98. They consider that, for example:(i) there is inadequate emphasis on accurate planning and cost control;(ii) the absence of reliable standards of work content and material costprevents efficient planning and control of manpower, material andequipment resources ; ; i
(iii) there is scope for improvements in the techniques used for stockcontrol of consumable materials ;(iv) considerable scope exists for improving methods and procedures in both workshops and offices.99. The consultants believe that it should be possible over the next three years or so to achieve further savings in costs associated with main-tenanee of the order of  4 million a year, as compared with 1962-63 costlevels. They also consider that there should be substantial indirect benefitsflowing from the increased utilisation of aircraft made possible by more rapid overhaul.100. The findings and recommendations of the consultants have been studied by the Corporation^ management. Moreover, Section V of BOACs1962-63 Report shows the savings which have been achieved and acknow-ledges the scope for further economies.Sales, Advertising and Publicity Departments101. BOAC spends about 18 per cent (some  17 million in 1961-62) ofits total revenue on sales and advertising. About two-thirds of this is incurred in the areas covered by the Western, Eastern and Southern routes and the balance in Europe and the United Kingdom. The Corporation^percentage expenditure on advertising is materially less than most worldairlines, but its other selling expenses, such as the cost of its sales offices,its reservations system and the commissions paid to agents, are probablyof the same order and size.102. The consultants have submitted a favourable report on BOACssales, advertising and publicity. The Corporation has obtained a creditableshare in most of the markets to which it and its pool partners have readyaccess. The consultants consider that expenditure is at about the rightlevel and that, while there is scope for various detailed improvements (e.g.,clearer objectives as a result of market research, closer relations betweenthe Press Relations Department and the Advertising Department), the Cor-poration is getting good value for the. money it spends.The Financial Comptroller^ Division103. This division was selected for investigation as an example of thecentral administration. The consultants came to the conclusion that thereare opportunities for improving the organisation and methods of the division and reducing the size of the staff. They estimated that savings of  75,000a year or 6\ per cent of the division^ budget could be saved.J04. A most important conclusion was that the division has not been allotted the part or the authority that it should have in a commercialorganisation of the size of the Corporation. This raises issues, which are dealt with below, affecting the higher management and direction of theCorporation that go beyond the scope of the Financial Comptrollers divisionitself.General105. The reports of the three consultants cover an important and representative part of the Corporation^ activities.   It may be inferred
further that there is comparable scope for savings in other parts of theorganisation which have not been subject to special investigation. Inaddition to the savings which the consultants put at  4 million a year inrespect of engineering costs, there should be scope for major savings onflight operations staff. This might amount to  1 million a year. Overallthere could be scope for savings over the next three years or so of theorder of  6 million a year as compared with 1962-63 cost levels.106. The following features of boac&apos;s organisation deserve somecomment :-(a) Appointment of Part-time Chairman. In 1956 it was decided toappoint a part-time Chairman with the executive responsibilitiesbelow him divided between the Deputy Chairman and the managing director. This resulted in splitting the management of the Corpora-tion into two largely autonomous parts one under a full timeDeputy Chairman responsible for associated and subsidiary com-panies, and one under the Managing Director who was responsiblefor the operation of the airline itself. This system did not workwell, and has been abandoned since the appointment of a full timeChairman in 1960.(b) Technical direction. The technical direction of the Corporation hasbeen overburdened. The major task of pressing on with the improve-ments in the efficiency of the engineering department falls on the ChiefEngineer. At the same time the Corporation is concerned with theproblems of preparing for the introduction of the VC10 and working out design requirements for the Concord. It is at least questionable whether the day to day control of the engineering department should be combined with the responsibility for the longer termtechnical planning and design. It may also be that the authorityof the technical direction needs strengthening.(c) Labour relations. Despite its aim to act as a &quot; model&quot; employer,the Corporation seems to have felt inhibited from pursuing appro-priate policies by fears of the reactions of its employees and their trade unions. In April 1958, for example, proposals for changes were materially slowed up because the employees&apos; side statedpositively that they would discuss and assist in organisationalchanges in the engineering department only &quot; on the basis of a firm agreement on no sacking.&quot; The Select Committee on nationalised Industries and the consultants have both drawn atten-tion to the excessive staff numbers and resulting high costs. Thisis a problem which has not yet been fully solved.(d) Financial control.(i) Whilst the consultants strongly supported the principle of de-centralisation of accounting responsibilities to the operatingdivisions, they felt that this had been carried so far that it was difficult for the Financial Comptroller to exercise effective super-vision of the Corporation^ expenditure.(ii) The consultants suggested that greater attention should be givento the control of capital invested in the Corporation^ activities,
whether in the form of fixed or current assets. No statementof the balance sheet position whether budgeted or actual was drawn up except for the annual statutory accounts. The con-consultants recommended that, in accordance with the bestcommercial practice, detailed budgeting of all balance sheetitems should be introduced at an early date. The consultantsalso found evidence that the Corporation^ forecasting pro-procedures for capital expenditure were not satisfactory. It seemsas if these defects of management may well result from theinsufficient status accorded to financial control within theCorporation.X. boac&apos;s FUTURE FLEET107. boac&apos;s plans have been based on having by 1966-67 a fleetcomposed of 62 long range jet aircraft. It already has 20 Boeing 707aircraft of this type (this figure includes the 10 aircraft owned byBOAC-Cunard Ltd.) and has 42 VC10 aircraft on order for delivery overthe period 1964 to 1966. In view of the Corporation^ uncertainty as towhether it will require a fleet of this size, it may be as well to give a brief account of how this fleet was planned and of the part played bythe Corporation and the Government in its evolution.108. Prior to 1956 BOAC had considered the possibility of placing orders for long range jet aircraft for non-stop trans-Atlantic use, but had concluded that its best course was to base its plans on the use of longrange turboprop aircraft.109. Before the end of 1956 many international airlines had becomeconvinced that the American long range pure jet aircraft would have greater passenger appeal and also be at least competitive in operating costs with turboprop aircraft. By that time no British aircraft of this typecould be available in the same time scale, so the Corporation sought to buy seventeen of the Boeing 707 aircraft which its competitors hadalready ordered. At this time expenditure in dollars and other hardcurrencies was closely controlled. The Government could not afford to ignore the fact that in so far as BOAC met its requirements with american aircraft, there would be serious repercussions on the British aircraft manu-facturing industry whose hopes of becoming a supplier of long range jettransport aircraft would have been jeopardised. Nevertheless, in the lightof the Corporation^ clearly established need to safeguard its competitive position on the trans-Atlantic routes, the Government agreed in October,1956, to the purchase of fifteen Boeing 707 aircraft, on the understandingthat no further dollars could be made available thereafter. These aircraft were powered by Rolls Royce Conway engines.110. With regard to requirements for routes other than the north atlantic, the Corporation told the Ministry in October, 1956, that it hada requirement for about 20-25 aircraft by 1962 with a carrying capacitysmaller than the American jets, but with comparable operating costs, foruse on these routes.
111. The Government and the Corporation both wantedC) the british aircraft manufacturing industry to be given an opportunity of meeting this requirement, in order both to safeguard the prospects of the industryand to insure against any failure of the Boeing 707 to fulfil expectation.112. In the autumn of 1956 BOAC in consultation with the Ministry ofSupply and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, examined ade Havilland proposal (the DH118) for an aircraft suitable for both theNorth Atlantic and other routes. Although the proposed de Havillandaircraft was more flexible than the Boeing 707, this did not offset thebasically greater operating economy of the American projects.113. In the early part of 1957, BOAC considered a number of paperprojects including the following : De Havilland 120 (medium range jet).Bristol Britannia 422 (Orion engine).Bristol 201 (medium range jet).Vickers Vanguard (long range version).Vickers VC10 Mk. IV (medium range jet).Handley Page HP97 (civil Victor).114. By April, 1957, BOAC had reached the conclusion that a version ofthe Vickers&apos; VC10 was the project most likely to meet its requirements,and it seemed that Vickers were the only firm prepared to go ahead withoutfinancial assistance from the Government. In a letter to the Minister ofTransport and Civil Aviation on 30th April, 1957, the Chairman of BOACsaid &quot; The Board of the Corporation have met to-day to consider the positionand have decided that the Vickers offer is the most favourable which can besecured for an aircraft which so closely meets the needs of the corporation on size, range and other operational characteristics.&quot; Authority was sought to place order:; for thirty-five VC10 aircraft. This was the minimum numberon which the manufacturer was prepared to proceed without direct financialassistance from the Government. In the circumstances the Corporationdecided to go ahead on this basis. It was encouraged in this by the factthat its estimates of traffic growth forecast full employment for a fleet of this size.115. Thus, after a thorough survey of what the British aircraft industry could offer, the Standard VC10 with seating for 120-130 passengers becamethe Corporation^ choice for its Eastern and Southern routes. Shortly afterthe Government had approved the placing of an order, the Chairman wrote to the Minister as follows :  &quot; It should ... be borne in mind that in the VC10 we are con-cerned with a project tailored to our requirements of up-to-date design and conceived for civil purposes for delivery in the middle sixties when we want it.&quot;(&apos;) In a letter dated 24th July 1956, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation had written to the Chairman of the Corporation that it was important to be clear that &quot; BOACare doing all they can within their obligations to operate as a commercial concern tohelp the British aircraft industry &quot;. In his reply of 26th July 1956, the Chairman saidthat &quot; the Board and the Executives of the Corporation are fully conscious of the heavyresponsibility which lies on us to ensure that so long as we do not prejudice our own positionin the highly competitive international industry we are engaged upon, it is our wish and our duty to give the maximum possible support to the British aircraft industry.&quot;
116. The Standard VC10 had been designed tor the Eastern and Southernroutes where its relatively short runway length requirements were importantbut its possibilities for trans-Atlantic use were never lost sight of. After an investigation of the take-off and cruise drag performance of the Boeing 707and the VC10, in which Vickers, BOAC and the Royal Aircraft Establish-ment took part, the Corporation came to the conclusion that the VC10should be as good as the Boeing 707 on the North Atlantic route. A contract for 35 VC10&apos;s was signed on 14th January, 1958. It contained an option,exercisable in 1962, on a further 20 aircraft.117. The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation expressed fears thatthe stretching of the VCIO to adapt it for trans-Atlantic use might haveimpaired its economic performance on Eastern routes. The Chairman replied to these doubts as follows in a letter of 25th February, 1958 :&quot; With regard to VC10 performance on Eastern routes, I am advised that the increased weight and power of the version we have ordered ascompared with the earlier version shows little, if any, economic penalty.We feel that such marginal penalty as there may be will be more than offset by the advantages flowing from the flexibility which we shall have as a result of being able to switch aircraft to the Atlantic run when necessary. An integrated fleet is likely to produce far greater economic benefits than any marginal improvements the so-called EasternHemisphere aircraft might have over the world wide aircraft.&quot;118. During the latter part of 1958 and throughout 1959 BOAC con-tinued discussions with the manufacturers about development of the VC10for trans-Atlantic use. The concept of an enlarged version of the VC10 withseating capacity for 180-190 passengers, later known as the Super VC10,arose from these discussions. In January, 1960, Vickers reported that theyhad seriously under estimated the cost of developing the VC10 and theposition was so serious that they might be unable to continue production ofthe aircraft unless a further order for at least ten Super VC10&apos;s was placedimmediately. BOAC told the Minister of Aviation that it would have pre-ferred to delay a decision on the exercise of its option until 1962. Neverthe-less, in view of the difficulties in which Vickers were placed, and since it would eventually require aircraft of the Super VC10 type for trans-Atlantic services,the Corporation was prepared to place an immediate order for ten aircraft inaddition to the thirty-five already ordered. The Minister replied to theChairman on 21st January, 1960, as follows:&quot; You told me at our recent meeting that the Corporation had for various reasons decided to place an order for ten of these aircraft subjectto satisfactory arrangements on cost.While I made it clear to you that I was not asking you to adopt thiscourse there is no doubt that your decision will be most helpful to theaircraft industry. As I told you, I am equally interested in promoting the financial prosperity of the Corporations and of the manufacturing industry. I must, therefore leave it to you and Vickers to settle the pricebetween you.&quot;BOAC thereupon sought and was given approval to buy ten additional aircraft of the type then known as the Super VC10.
119. Between September, 1960, and January, 1961, the Corporationreached the conclusion, in discussion with Vickers, that the Super VC10aircraft with 187 seats was over-stretched and would not prove fully satis-factory. It concluded that an intermediate sized aircraft, providing accom-modation for about 160 passengers, would produce a better economic resultand be more flexible. It accordingly sought approval to alter the order tocover fifteen Standard and thirty modified Super VC10 aircraft. The Govern-ment approved on the understanding that the cost should be kept within thetotal previously approved and the order was modified in October, 1961, tocover twelve Standard and thirty modified Super VC10 aircraft.120. In determining its requirement for VC10&apos;s, the Corporation had ofcourse studied closely the estimated growth of world traffic. In 1961 whenthe size and composition of the VC10 order was finalised, BOAC estimatedthat traffic would continue to grow at a rate of about 12^ per cent per annum.In fact it then foresaw a shortage of jet capacity in 1963-64 and 1964-65,and it was authorised to order 3 more Boeing 707 aircraft to fill this gap.Two more Boeings, making up the total fleet of 20, were added on the forma-tion of BOAC-Cunard Ltd. Since 1961, however, the rate of growth of traffichas fallen sharply, and boac&apos;s competitive position has worsened. It now seems, therefore, as if the Corporation may by 1966-67 if it takes delivery of the full order of forty-two VC10&apos;s and retains the full present BOACand BOAC-Cunard fleet of twenty Boeings have some ten aircraft too many.121. boac&apos;s Board is now considering the relative merits of eithercancelling or postponing delivery of some VC10&apos;s, or disposing of someof the Boeings during the next few years. On the one hand the VC10is more expensive to buy than the older Boeing 707. The advent of thesupersonic Concord may mean that some vc10s will have a shorter period in service than the normal, thus making it necessary to write them offover a shorter period with consequential higher amortisation charges.Moreover, the advantage which was expected to accrue by reason of theVC10&apos;s landing and take-off performance has been reduced by the strengthening and lengthening of runways in the Eastern and Southernhemisphere in recent years. On the other hand, revenue should benefit from the passenger appeal of the more modern VC10 with its rear-enginedconfiguration. A few years hence, indeed, a forward-engined configurationwith the resulting volume of cabin noise may seem as obsolete to the passenger as a propeller does today. The VC10, furthermore, promises ahigher standard of safety owing to its lower landing speed and its provisionfor the installation of full blind landing equipment. Blind landing shouldalso improve regularity and punctuality of service. It therefore remains to be seen what the net effect of these advantages and disadvantages willbe on the operating economics of the VC10 fleet.
XI.  THE FUTURE122. The main factors affecting the future prospects of the Corporationare: (i) the expected growth and distribution of the traffic;(ii) the aircraft fleet employed to meet it; ;(iii) the level of air fares and rates ; 1 &apos;(iv) the level of costs; and(v) the efficiency of the Corporation^ management and direction.The rate of traffic growth has slackened in the last few years. It now seems unlikely that traffic will come up to the expectations of .1957-60on which boac&apos;s fleet was planned for the second half of this decade.As a result, reduction of the fleet may be required.123. But there are still many uncertainties. How far will the workfsairlines be successful in stimulating cargo as well as passenger services?Will they achieve a better balance between capacity and traffic than inrecent years? Will the political and economic climate be favourable toBOACs efforts to obtain a greater share of the business? And in the longer term, what are the possibilities of fundamental changes in the pattern of world airline operations, such as the emergence of the Russianairline Aeroflot as a stronger competitor on the inter-continental routes?If a reduction in the planned fleet should be necessary, should it take theform of a cancellation of any of the forty-two vc10s on order, or rather the disposal of any of the Boeing 707s? To what extent will these typescontinue in service after the advent of the Concord?124. boac&apos;s revenues may be much affected by changes in the levelof air fares which are fixed by international agreement. The trend islikely to be downwards, and all but the lowest cost airlines are likely tofind themselves operating on very narrow margins if not at a loss.125. It is expected that during the current year (1963-64) BOACsrevenues will be sufficient to cover operating expenditure and may make some contribution to interest charges. This is an improvement on last year(1962-63) when revenues were short of expenditure by over  2 million.Gross interest charges for 1963-64 will be of the order of  8^ million ofwhich  3J million can be attributed to the accumulated deficit.*.j&apos;&quot;f&apos;iOiq ,-jiUnniiUi ull ,ui.j7   pa.I     .fjJ)Oi 8301)   iJli3C]05q (i -wj  SSgrtOiHfiq126. Even allowing for progressive reductions in cost it seems unlikelythat this position can be improved during 1964-65 or in the following twoyears. During these two years the Corporation will be incurring the costs of introducing the VC10 into service. These introductory costs arise fromthe need to retrain crews, from the low utilisation and low engine overhaulperiods which attend any new aircraft and from the costs of introducingnew maintenance and servicing procedures. By 1966-67, however, BOACsfleet should be composed of only two types of aircraft, and the fruits ofthe VC10 should begin to appear. After that, much will, of course,depend on how far the passenger appeal of the VC10 will lead to increasedload factors and revenue and so off-set its higher capital charges. equally important will be the extent to which a vigorous management secureseconomies in operating costs.
XII.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS127. About half the Corporation^ deficit arises from the disaster tothe Comet L. the delay over, the Britannia and the resulting need to equipwith a stop-gap fleet of different types of aircraft.&apos;; 128. The full extent of. this part of the losses was obscured by theunduly low amortisation charges made in respect of aircraft in the annualaccounts. By 1959, if not earlier, it should have been seen that the rateof amortisation charged in the Corporation^ accounts was inadequate.129. Some  15 million were lost in investments in associated and sub-sidiary companies. Even if the policy underlying these investments were sound,the control of them was unsatisfactory. It is not possible to estimate howfar this loss was offset by gains to the Corporation in winning feedertraffic or fending off competition. It appears, however, that much of thetotal of  15 million must be regarded as a net loss.,130. Many of the advantages which the Corporation enjoyed in its early years have been eroded by the growth of foreign competition, the emergence of new airlines, the disappearance of cabotage points and thedevelopment of longer range aircraft. The Corporation has faced up tothis challenge imaginatively but it has followed an expansionist policywhich, in the light of these adverse factors, has proved unduly optimistic.131. The Corporation remains the second largest long-haul internationalairline in the world. Its standards of safety, reliability and passenger service are second to none. Much has been done and is being done toimprove organisation.. But financial direction and control are inadequate and the cost of engineering services excessive. There is a need for strongermanagement.
Annex I16th January, 1957AMORTISATION OF AIRCRAFT AND MAJOR SPARESAs requested, the auditors of the two Air Corporations have consideredthe question of amortisation of aircraft and major spares having cheifly mind the requirement of section 22 of the Air Corporations Act, 1949which calls for the accounts of the two corporations to &quot; conform with thebest commercial standards&quot;. In this connection the series of &quot; Recom-mendations on Accounting Principles&quot; issued from time to time by the institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, is generally recognised as authoritative on these matters.Recommendation IX of the Instituted recommendations deals with&quot;Depreciation of Fixed Assets&quot; and the following excerpts therefrom are relevant to the present discussion:-&quot;Fixed assets, whatever be their nature or the type of business inwhich they are employed, have the fundamental characteristic thatthey are held with the object of earning revenue and not for thepurpose of sale in the ordinary course of business. The amount atwhich they are shown in the balance sheet does not purport to be their realisable value or their replacement value, but is normally an historical record of their cost less amounts provided in respect of&quot;  depreciation, amortisation or depletion.&quot;Depreciation represents that part of the cost of a fixed asset toits owner which is not recoverable when the asset is finally put outof use by him.   Provision against this loss of capital. is an integral&quot; cost of conducting the business during the effective commercial life of the asset and is not dependent upon the amount of profit earned.&quot; The assessment of depreciation involves the consideration of three factors ; the cost of the asset, which is known, the probable valuerealisable on ultimate disposal, which can generally be estimated only within fairly wide limits, and the length of time during which theasset will be commercially useful to the undertaking. In most cases,this last factor is not susceptible of precise calculation. provisions for depreciation are therefore in most cases matters of estimation,based upon the available experience and knowledge, rather than ofaccurate determination. They require adjustment from time to timein the light of changes in experience and knowledge, including pro-prolongation of useful life due to exceptional maintenance expenditure,curtailment due to excessive use, or obsolescence not allowed forin the original estimate of the commercially useful life of the asset.&quot; Subject to any periodic adjustment which may be necessary, thestraight-line method (computed by providing each year a fixed pro-portion of the cost of the asset) spreads the provision equally overthe period of anticipated use. It is used almost universally in theUnited States of America and Canada and to a large extent in thiscountry. Though other methods may be appropriate in the case ofsome classes of assets, the balance of informed opinion now favoursthe straight-line method as being the most suitable for general application.
&quot; Provisions for depreciation, amortisation and depletion of fixed assets should be applied on consistent bases from one period toanother. If additional provisions prove to be necessary, they shouldbe stated separately in the profit and loss account. . . .&quot;Amounts set aside out of profits for obsolescence which cannotbe foreseen, or for a possible increase in the cost of replacementare matters of financial prudence. Neither can be estimated with any degree of accuracy. They are in the nature of reserves and should betreated as such in the accounts.&quot;The foregoing principles are properly applicable to the amortisationof aircraft and major spares. The auditors therefore recommend thatthe provisions for amortisation of these assets and the treatment of these provisions in the accounts should be on the following basis:1. The cost, including cost of major modifications, of aircraft and major spares less the estimated value realisable on ultimate disposal, shouldbe written off on what is known as the straight-line method, that is by making provision for amortisation in equal annual instalments over the life during which it is estimated that the aircraft will be commerciallyuseful to the Corporation.2. The factors which have of necessity to be estimated in arriving atthe provision under (1) should be reviewed and adjusted from time totime in the light of later experience and knowledge and in the event ofany material variation the provision for amortisation should be increasedor reduced accordingly.3. Variations in bases of making provisions for amortisation as between one period and another, if resulting in changes of material amount, shouldbe disclosed by way of note in the annual accounts and the amount ofthe increase or reduction in the provision arising as a result of the changeof bases should be stated.4. The amortisation provisions recommended in (1) and (2) above are designed to take account of both depreciation and obsolescence so far as these can be reasonably foreseen from time to time. They do not take account of possible changes in the cost of replacement of aircraft or ofobsolescence which cannot be foreseen. The setting aside of profits tomeet these eventualities is a matter of financial prudence and any amountso set aside would be of the nature of a reserve.The setting aside of profits in this way and the amounts to be set aside are matters in regard to which the Minister, under section 18 ofthe Air Corporations Act, 1949, has power, with the approval of theTreasury, to give directions and presumably the Corporations should discuss with him the amounts which they may have in mind thus to appropriate.Whinney Smith and WhinneyPrice Waterhouse and Co.

Annex IIIRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO AIR CORPORATIONS1. The problems facing BOAC have naturally revived interest in the ideaof a merger of BOAC and the British European Airways Corporation (BEA).This proposal has been the subject of some public controversy and it maybe helpful to set out the main arguments for and against it.2. The view that the operation of all air transport services of the UnitedKingdom should not be entrusted to a single operator was endorsed in white papers presented to Parliament in March and December, 1945.3. This conclusion was influenced by the following considerations:  (i) the need for flexibility in meeting current conditions of international competition;(ii) the need to encourage different methods of approach to the tech-techniques of airline operation ;(iii) the creation of a pool of knowledge and experience capable of meeting the expansion of air travel which was expected.4. In the event, three Corporations were established by the Air Corpora-tions Act, 1946. In July, 1949, one of these the British South american airways Corporation was abolished, and its functions taken over by BOAC.5. Since that time there has been discussion of the pros and cons ofmerging BOAC and BEA into a single Corporation. The main aspectsmay be summarised as follows:  (a) Arguments in favour of merger(i) The two Corporations have widely different roles but they have manyfunctions in common. Their basic task is to carry passengers and freightby air in safety, comfort and at a reasonable price. Each has its own department for engineering and maintenance, sales and publicity, groundtransport and catering. These are all similar functions requiring similarskills and equipment. The total expenditure of both Corporations in these departments amounted in 1962-63 to some  60 million. It is reasonable to suppose that, if these functions could be combined, there would be scope for at least some economies.(ii) Most European airlines operate both long and short haul services.There is no evidence that a merger of the two Corporations would create a unit so large as to be unwieldy. Indeed, the current trend is towards anincrease in the size of airlines.(iii) It is essential to boac&apos;s long distance network to have some stopsin Europe so that it can compete effectively with European carriers serving the same overseas markets. BEA in turn has developed services on longhaul routes to the Middle East. Thus, on a number of important routesthrough Europe, the two Corporations operate in parallel and their differ-ences of role have narrowed. A single Corporation would be able to bringabout complete integration between both services and sales efforts on theroutes where at present they may overlap.
(iv) BOAC has an interest in attracting the trans-Atlantic traffic betweenEurope and the North American continent to stage through London. a merger might facilitate boac&apos;s efforts to get a greater share of this traffic.(v) Better aircraft utilisation might be achieved if long haul, aircraftnow terminating in London after a trans-Atlantic service were able, to-fit.in &quot; stub-end &quot; services to points in Europe while still adhering to their return schedules to New York. Such &quot; stub-end &quot; services could be operatedeconomically with long range jets even with a low load factor.(b) Arguments against merger &apos;(i) Loss of inter-line revenue would result to BEA because Americancarriers give preference on interdine sales to BEA, which does not compete with them on the North Atlantic. This traffic might not accrue to aBritish airline to the same extent if the short haul element were mergedwith the long haul and the combined airline thus became in all respects acompetitor with the American airlines on the North Atlantic route;(ii) Admittedly the two Corporations have many functions in commonbut closer examination shows that in most of these the similaritiesare more apparent than real. For example, the overhaul of aircraft is one of the most vital factors in airline operation, and is a primeresponsibility of the airline itself. Apart from Comet aircraft, each Cor-poration operates a totally different fleet from the other. Owing to thedifference in the types of operation it carries out, each Corporation has to conform to different schedules and cycles of work. It would therefore bedifficult to fit aircraft from both of them into one maintenance programme.(iii) BEA&apos;s morale is high. It made a profit in each of the seven years ending March, 1961, and it now shows every promise of returning to afurther period of profitability. BEA, however, will be hard put to it, tohold its ground, and a merger at this stage would be an immediatedistraction.6. The arguments for and against are finely balanced. Nevertheless,neither of the Corporations is in favour of merger at the present time.BOAC considers that it would not solve its immediate problems ; BEA thatit would destroy its singleness of purpose and esprit de corps.7. In 1946 the Chairmen of both Corporations formed an Airline Chair-men^ Committee. This meets monthly. Its purpose is to resolve internaldifficulties and pursue opportunities for collaboration. In practice, how-ever, the results achieved by this Committee have proved disappointing.(31105)  Wt. 780-6586  96, 15, 81   11/63  St.S.
ANNEX BTHE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OE THEBRITIsh ^/ER^SEAS SrvIays C ORPORATI ONINTRODUCTION1 .     In the sixteen years since it began its commercial operations,B.O.A.C. has earned a reputation for safety and service second to none;it has held its position as the second largest long haul airline inthe world;   and in 1962 it raised its net contribution to the balanceof payments to  20 million.       In the last ten years it has almosttrebled its traffic and revenue.     But B.O.A.C. like some other airlineshas not succeeded in recent years in paying its way.     The table in para. 10 shows how, over the years, it had built up a deficit.This stood, in its accounts for 1962/63, at  80 million.2.     The purpose of this paper is to consider hov; these losses have oome about. This calls first of all for a brief survey ofcertain aspects of the Corporations development.HISTORICAL BACKGROUND3.     The British Overseas Airways Corporation was established byAct of Parliament in 1939, as the successor to Imperial AirwaysLtd.     For the next five years its resources were harnessed to thewar effort.     At the end of 1945 a Government White Paper &quot;british air Services (Cmd. 6712)&quot; set the framework within which B.O.A.C.has since operated.4..     B.O.A.C. was to be responsible for air services on theroutes between the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries,the United States, and the Par East.     It was to enjoy a monopoly of the rights to operate British scheduled services on these routes.     The Government&apos;s aim was that the Corporations should bemade self-supporting as soon as possible.     It was howeverrecognised that if air transport was &quot;to fulfil its function of
providing services in the public interest, some measure of State aidmay be necessary to support essential but unremunerative services&quot;.B.O.A.C. was also required to fly British aircraft.     This meant thatat the outset   it would have to fly &quot;aircraft which have been developedfrom basic military types&quot;.     Exchequer grants were accordingly to bemade until experience had been gained of commercial operations withuntried aircraft.5. The White Paper made it clear that, subject to the requirements ofthe G-overnment1 s general policy, the Corporation would have the maximumfreedom in the operation and management of the air services assigned tothem. These policies were largely embodied in the Civil Aviation Act,1946. Under this Act, British South American Airways was set up as aseparate Corporation with responsibilities for Services between theUnited Kingdom and Scuth America and the West Indies. In 1949* it wasmerged with B.O.A.C.
60     In the period 19^7 to 1951 the Corporation was ina strong position to secure a high proportion of the traffic available.    It enjoyed a monopoly on routes tothe colonies and favourable partnerships on many routeslinking the independent Commonwealth countries.    But itsoperating costs were abnormally high mainly as a resultof flying wartime aircraft types adapted to civil use.Heavy losses followed.    During this period B.O.A.C.received  32 million in grants from the Exchequer,7.     By 1952 B.O.A.C. had begun to rationalise itsaircraft fleet.    The Comet I came into service in thatyear and brought an immediate increase in traffic.    In1952-53, for example, the average passenger load factorfor B.O.A.C.&apos;s aircraft on East and South Africanservices was about 63 per cent.    The Comet I load factoraveraged 87 per cent.    Eor the first year since the wargrants were unnecessary,    A period of prosperity seemedassured.    These hopes were shattered by the Cometdisasters in 1953/5^.    The Corporation had to buy american aircraft off the shelf at high prices to maintain itsservices.    These had limited passenger appeal;    and b.O.A.C.&apos;s share in the expansion of world air trafficdropped sharply.    Nevertheless, for the period 1952-56as a whole the Corporation was able to show a profit.8.     The disasters to the Comet I were followed by delaysto the Britannia.    B.O.A.C. had not only staked its money on the pure jet Comet.    It had also backed the turbopropBritannia with its long range and low operating costs.The Britannias were to have been delivered in 195^-55.But their introduction was delayed by 21 years.    &quot;When, atthe end of 1957? the Britannia 312 was introduced on theNorth Atlantic service, it was only a year ahead of theAmerican long range pure jet, ordered by B.O.A,C.&apos;s
competitors.   These soon drew traffic away from the slower turbopropBritannia.9. In the years since 1956, a number of colonies have become independentnations. B.O.A.C. has thus lost most of its valuable cabotage rights. a growing number of countries, moreover, have entered the long haul airline;business, and many of &quot;them have bought big jet aircraft. This increasein the number of operators has coincided, in the last few years, with adecline in the rate of growth of air traffic generally. An increasing number of foreign governments have resorted to restrictive practices toprotect their own airlines. Thus at a time when competition has been growing, when long haul airlines everywhere have suffered from too muchcapacity, and when restrictive practices have been on the increase,B.O.A.C. has lost most of the special advantages which it enjoyed at the outset.

11.   It may be convenient to consider this deficit under thefollowing headings;(i)   The amortisation of aircraft,(ii)   The introductory costs of new aircraft,(iii)   Investment in associated and subsidiary companies,(iv)   Operating results,(v)   Organisation and management.I.     Amortisation of Aircraft12.   Modern aircraft are very expensive.     The Corporations CometTV and Britannia 312 aircraft, for example, cost over  1 millioneach, excluding spares and ancillary equipment.     A modern longrange jet costs well over  2 million.     Competition has forced theworld&apos;s airlines into a race for better and faster aircraft.Every airline carries a heavy burden of capital charges.13.   B.O.A.C. allocates annual sums from revenue to provide foramortisation of its aircraft and other assets.     In calculating the minimum amounts to be set aside for amortisation, the Corporationdecided in 1957 to assume that -(i)   the useful life of its new aircraft would be seven years,and(ii)   if disposed of after seven years, they would realise25 per cent of their original cost.These provisions have proved inadequate for a number of theCorporation^ aircraft.     Nearly half the accumulated deficit (some 35 million) is attributable to losses on aircraft, resultingfrom a shorter expectation of life in service or a loss ondisposal.14.   A small portion of the  35 million capital loss on aircraft was due to Tudor, Hermes and Comet I aircraft.     All of these
entered service before 1953.     The major portion of the capital loss,amounting to  32 million, is due to the DC7C, Britannia 102 and 312 andComet TV aircrart which have entered service since 1956.     These lossescan be put down to three main causes:(i)    the consequences of the disasters which befell theComet I in 1953-54;(ii)    the technical troubles, in particular with icing andthe electrical system, which in 1955-57 delayed bothmarks of Britannia;(iii)   the widespread introduction from 1958 onwards of the big American jets on the long haul routes.15.   Had the Comet i succeeded, B.O.A.C. would have kept the lead injet operations for seme years.     As it was heavy outlay on stop gapaircraft was called for to remedy the loss of capacity.16.   The Britannia was an outstanding aircraft of advanced design.But the delays in delivery of the long range type, the Britannia 312,designed primarily for the North Atlantic routes, obliged the corporation to buy DC7Cs. as a stop gap to safeguard its competitive position.     TheBritannia 312 was introduced into Service on the North Atlantic at theend of 1957.     Less than a year later, B.0.A.C.&apos;s competitors began to operate these routes with long range pure jets.17.   The effect on B.O.A.C. of the introduction of the large Americanjets was twofold.     First, the Corporation had itself to orderBoeing 707s or forego the opportunity to compete on level terms withits main rivals.     Second, the operational lives of B.0.A.C.&apos;sfleet of Britannias, DC7C&apos;s and., to a lesser extent, Comets
1 5 Piwere drastically shortened.   They could not compete in passenger appealwith the improved range, capacity and speed offered by the big American jets.1 8,   By March, 19&amp;1 , the DC7Cs were withdrawn from scheduled passenger services.   The last Britannia 102 service took place before the endof 1962.   By then the Britannia 312s had also lost their passenger appealand had a strictly limited useful life.   The earliest version of the(a)Comet IVV &apos; also seemed likely to have a shorter operational life thanoriginally planned.19.   Throughout the period, the Corporation made no change in the rateof amortisation until it presented the accounts for 19^1-62.   A revaluationthen took place.   As a result additional amortisation of  32 million was brought to account.   This largely explains the steep rise in the accumulated deficit in that year. (See paragraph 13 and the Table in paragraph 10.)II.   Introductory Costs of New Aircraft20.   When an airline introduces a new type of aircraft, it has to meet expenditure on activities such as training aircrew, route proving flights,adapting engineering and maintenance departments, and providing ground equipmer.and spares along the whole length of the routes to be covered.   Between 1956and 1962 the Corporation introduced five different types of aircraft.   at no time did it have less than four types in service.   The pre-operational and training expenditure shown separately by the Corporation in its accounts for the six years ended 31st March, 1962, on DC7C, Britannia, Comet IV andBoeing 707 aircraft amounts to nearly  13 million.   Of this,  5 million was written off as a special item in 1958-59,  4.2 million has been written off in annual instalments and the balance of  3.8 million (of which all but 1 million related to Boeing 707 aircraft was carried forv/ard at 31st March,1 962, for future amortisation.(1 )   This is not the improved Comet IVB now in service with B.E.A. orthe Comet IVC which is still in production.
21.     The Corporation could reduce development costs if it flew only-proven aircraft pioneered by others.     Such a policy may be unavoidablefor the smaller airlines for whom the risks and problems of introducingnew types would be overwhelming.     B.O.A.C, however, remains the secondlargest international long haul airline in the world.     Its success mustlargely depend not only on standards of safety, reliability and passengercomfort - where there is not much to choose between the best airlines -but on being first in the air with new aircraft of higher performance and increased passenger appeal.     It is moreover a considerable advantage to a large airline - as B.E.A&apos;s experience with the Viscount has shown -to have an aircraft designed to meet its own requirements.III.     Investment in Associated and Subsidiary Companies22.      During the last fifteen years B.O.A.C. has held investments in anumber of airline companies operating local and regional services invarious parts of the world.     Since 1957 such investments have been held byB.O.A.C. Associated Companies Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary company of B.O.A.C.23.      The accumulated deficit arising from subsidiary and associated companies during the period from 1st April, 1947? to 31st March, 19&amp;3,is calculated by the Corporation to be  14*6 million.     About  13 million of this total deficit has arisen during the seven years ended 31st March,1963.     The greater part of it is accounted for by the following fivecompanies: mBritish West Indian Airways Ltd. 4*7Bahamas Airways Limited 1.7Middle East Airlines 3.0Mid-East Aircraft Service Company 1.5Kuwait Airways 1.412.3The commitments in regard to Kuwait were undertaken by B.O.A.C. at the express request of the Government, and the Minister authorised theCorporation to record this in its Annual Report for 1958-59*
24.    Within the last two or three years, the Corporations   commitmentsassociated and subsidiary companies have been drastically reduced.In particulars(i)   the shares in Middle East Airlines have been sold and mid-East Aircraft Service Company has been wound up;(ii)     The Corporation has disposed of all but a 10 per centinterest in British West Indian Airways Limitedf(iii)     the agreement with Kuwait Airways came to an end on31st May, 1963? and is not being renewed.25.   The Corporations motive for investing in local airlines hasbeen to secure feeder traffic for the main trunk services and toprotect transit and traffic rights.     The investment   also helped toprovide a market for British aircraft.     But even if the policyunderlying this investment was sound its implementation was   unsatis-factory.   It is not possible to estimate how far this loss incurredwas offset by gains to the Corporation, but there can be little   doubtthat the losses suffered by B.O.A.C. in this field considerably out-weigh any benefits.IV.   Operating Results26.   Of the total deficit accumulated over the last seven years, 28 million were due to the failure of the Corporation to earn enough of a surplus on operating account to cover interest on oapital -andother miscellaneous charges.    Most of this loss arose in the twoyears 1961 and 1962.     In these years, B.0,A.C&apos;s revenue fell short of operating costs, including standard amortisation, and failed to meet any part of the interest charges.   Traffic growth slackened and airlinecapacity expandad on the long haul routes.
27.     B.O.A.C. at one time expected that expansion on the Worth Atlanticroutes would compensate for loss of traffic on the traditional Commonwealtand colonial routes.    But competition on the North Atlantic increasedsharply, and B.O.A.C. suffered particularly from the introduction of the&quot;big jets which made it possible to fly direct between the United States anposts in Europe without staging through London.28.     Between the calendar years i960 and 196.1., the world average passenge:load factor on scheduled international services dropped from 58.8 percentto 53*0 percent, a drop of over five points.    In 1962 it dropped further to 52.1  percent.    On the Corporation^ scheduled services the drop was froi59.8 percent to 49*6 percent between 196O and 1961, a fall of ten points,with a further fall to 47-6 percent in 1962.    The Corporation^ load facto]thus fell to a level lower than that of the industry as a whole.    Yet up t(1960 its load factor had been higher than the average.29.     The factors leading to the deterioration of B.0.A.C.&apos;s position were becoming apparent some years ago.    It was not easy for the Corporation to adjust itself to the changing circumstances.    The political changes in africa, for example, have taken place in less than the normal developmentcycle of a new aircrafts    the time it takes to order, introduce into service and amortise a new aircraft is, of course, an element of rigidityin all airline    policy,    Nevertheless the rate at which B.0.A.C continuedto expand its capacity and frequency was unduly optimistic.V.     Internal organisation and management30.    As part of the general enquiry undertaken at the Government&apos;request, studies have recently been made by professional consultantsinto three aspects of B.0.A.C.&apos;s activities.
CONFIDENTIALjl tsi a(i)   sales, advertising and publicity;(ii)   engineering and maintenance;(iii)    financial control.31 i   The first of these studies concludes that the Corporation&apos;s effortcn sales, advertising and publicity has been at about the right leveland well directed.32.   The second study shows that the engineering and maintenancedepartments have consistently given rise to excessive costs.Substantial savings have been achieved in recent years, partly asthe number of aircraft types have been simplified.     The consultants,however, believe that further savings of the order of  i+ million a yearcould be achieved over the next 3 years or so without in any way loweringthe high technical standard of the work.33&apos;   The report on financial control finds weakness in this aspect ofthe Corporation&apos;s administration.     It concludes that financial controlhas not been accorded sufficient importance within the Corporation.
THE FUTURE34*   The main factors affecting the future prospects of the Corporation are:-(i)   the expected growth and distribution of the traffic;(ii)   the composition and cost of the aircraft fleet emplyed to meet it;(iii)^the level of air fires and rates;(iv)^ policy for air traffic rights;(v)   the efficiency of the Corporations management and direction,I. Traffic35*   The rate of traffic growth has slackened in the last few years.     Manyuncertainties remain.     How far will the world1 s airlines be successful in stimulating cargo as well as passenger services?    Will they achieve abetter balance between capacity and traffic than in recent years?     will the political climate be favourable to B.O.A.C.&apos;s efforts to obtain agreater share of the business?    And in the longer term, what are thepossibilities of fundamental changes in the pattern of world airlineoperations, such as the emergence of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, as a stronger competitor on the inter-continental routes?     To what extent willsubsonic jets continue in service after the advent of the Concord?     Theaeare questions which the management of B.O.A.C. will have to answer before they can finally determine the density and pattern of their routes, the frequencies of service and the size and composition of their aircraft fleet,II. The Aircraft Fleet.36.   The next two years present a particular problem.     The Corporation will then be incurring the costs of introducing the VC10 into service.     Theseintroductory costs arise from the need to re-train crews, from the lowerutilisation and lower engine overhaul periods which attend any new aircraft and from the costs of introducing new maintenance and servicing procedures.By 1966-67, however, B.0.A.C*1 s fleet should be composed of only two types of aircraft, and the fruits of the VC10 should begin to appear.     Much will depend on how far the passenger appeal of the VC10 will lead to increasedload factors and revenue and will offset its higher capital charges.III. Air Traffic Rights.37.   After the war the British Government, in company with other Governments,set out to establish a system of agreements and practices within whichinternational civil aviation has operated until the present time.CONFIDENTIAL
4 r (f5156The Chicago Convention of 1 944 set up the International Civil AviationOrganisation.     There is also a series of bilateral   agreements governing the exchange of traffic rights.3o.   It is the Government&apos;s responsibility to negotiate the traffic rightswithout which B.O.A.C cannot operate abroad and its competitors cannotland in this country.   In the post war years rights were given liberally bythe United Kingdom Government both at home and in colonial territories.    Itwas believed that this would foster the development of world services and encourage similarly liberal policies in the countries lying on the maininternational routes.   This policy has   hitherto been justified by itsresults.   Britain had much to give and got much in return.   In recent years,however, competition has increased, capacity has outgrown traffic development and restrictive practices by foreign governments have intensified.   with a.O.A.C. exposed increasingly to the two-pronged attack of increasedcompetition and restrictionism, it is right to ask how far Britain can afford to continue to grant traffic rights to airlines whose countriesdo not or   cannot provide comparable benefits for British airlines.   B.O.A.C.has pressed from time to time that some of the rights now enjoyed by foreignairlines in British territory should be reviewed to bring the exchange oftraffic rights into better balance.   Large issues are involved here.   Someadjustments have already been made.   Others maybe necessary.IV FARES39*   BoO.A.C.&apos;s revenues maybe much affected by changes in the level ofair fares which are fixed by international agreement.   There is growingpressure for lower fares.   If such a trend develops,    all but the lowestcost airlines are likely to find themselves operating on very narrow marginsif not at a loss.*\ &apos;       : &apos; - -&quot;ill
V.     Management4-0.   The crucial factor will be the success of B.0.A.C.&apos;s management incorrecting existing weaknesses in their organisation and in forecastingaccurately their future share of civil air traffic on the long haul routes.RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ,T.WQ. AIR COHPORATIONS41 *   The Government have studied the arguments for and against mergingB.O.A.C. and B.E.A. into a single Corporation.     There are powerfularguments for and against this course.42.   In favour, it can be argued, for example, that:(i)   the two Corporations have many common functions (e.g.engineering, catering) and merger would give scope foroverall economies;(ii)   the size of a merged Corporation would be no greater thanthat of certain other major airlines;(iii)   overlapping services could be eliminated and throughtraffic from North America to Europe would be increased.4-3&apos;   Against merger, it can be argued that(i) differences in the composition of the fleets make it more efficient to have two specialist organisationsas at present;(ii)   any gains on through traffic to Europe would be morethan offset by losses of inter-line sales at presentenjoyed by B.E.A.;(iii)   B.O.A.C. and B.E.A. are in very different financial circumstances.44.   The arguments for and against are finely balanced.Nevertheless, neither of the Corporations is in favour of mergerat the present time.     B.O.A.C. considers that it would not solveits immediate problems;   B.E.A. that it would destroy itssingleness of purpose and esprit de corps.
45*       In 1946 the Chairmen of &quot;both Corporations formed anAirline Chairmen&apos;s Committee.     This meets monthly.     Its purpose is to resolve internal difficulties and pursue opportunities for collaboration.     In practice, however, the results achieved bythis Committee have so far proved unrewarding.summary46*       In the last few years B.O.A.C. has lost its valuablecabotage rights as former Colonies have come to independence.The advent of the long range jet has also reduced the advantageY/hich the Corporation derived from London&apos;s position as anessential stopping point in trans-atlantic travel.   (Paras.9 and 27)47-       Over the same period the number of airlines competing forlong-haul business has increased, and airline capacity has expandedat a greater rate than traffic.     As a result, a number of foreign government have adopted a more restrictive attitude.     (Para. 9)The Corporation sought to meet this challenge but in the light ofthese adverse factors its policy has proved unduly optimistic.(Para. 29).48.       About half the Corporations deficit arises from thedisasters to the Comet I, the delays over the Britannia and the resulting need to equip with a stop-gap fleet of different types of aircraft.    (Paras. 14 - 19)-49*       14*6 million were lost in investments in associated and subsidiary companies.     Even if the policy underlying theseinvestments was sound, the control of them was unsatisfactory.It is not possible to estimate how far this loss was offset bygains to the Corporation in winning feeder traffic or fending offcompetition.     It appears, however, that much of the total of 14*6 million must be regarded as a net loss.   (Paras. 22 - 25)&quot;
50.     The Corporation remains the second largest long-haul internationalairline in the world.     Its standards of safety, reliability, and passenger service are second to none.    Much has been done and is being done toimprove organisation.   But financial direction and control have notbeen sufficiently effective and, despite considerable effort, the costof engineering services remains excessive.    There is a need for strongermanagement (Paras.30-33).conclusions.1.     The Government think it necessary to reaffirm that the Corporationmust operate as a commercial undertaking.    If the national interest should appear, whether to the Corporation or to the Government, to require somedeparture from commercial practice, this should only be done with theagreement or at the instance of the Minister of Aviation.52.     Against this background, the Government proposes(i)   to strengthen the mangement of theCorporationi(ii)   to ask the Chairman to prepare within 12 months and present to the Minister, a plan for making B.O.A.C. financiallysound s(iii)    meanwhile to secure Parliamentary authority for an extensionfor a further two years of the powers under theAir Corporations Act, 1962, to make loans for thepurpose of financing deficits on revenue account.53.     The Government have carefully considered whether a merger betweenB.O.A.C. and B.E.A. would be in the best interests of British aviation at this time.    On balance   they have decided against it.   They believe,however, that the two Corporations need to work more closely togetherthan they have in the past.   To facilitate greater collaboration betweenthe two Corporations, the Minister of Aviation will accordingly appoint the Chairman of each as a part-time member of the Board of the other.18th November, 1963.
1   H.l y vANNEX CDRAFT STATSMENTI will, with permission, make a statement about theBritish European Airways Corporation and the British overseas airways Corporation.L/Ord Douglas, who will be 70 in December, will be retiringfrom the Chairmanship of B. E. A. at the end of the financial year.He will then have completed 15 years as Chairman and I am sure theHouse will wish to join me in paying tribute to his great services toBritish aviation.   Lord Douglas will be succeeded by Mr. AnthonyMilward who has been Chief Executive of B. S.A. for the last seven years.Sir Matthew Slattery will be retiring from the chairmanship of B.O. A. C. in the New Year.   He has given B. O.A.C. greatservice in a very difficult period.Sir Matthew Slattery will be succeeded as Chairman bySir Giles Guthrie who has been for four years a member of theBoard of E. E. A, and has an outstanding aviation record in peace and war.I understand that it is Sir Giles Guthrie&apos;s intention to undertakehimself some of the functions of the Managing Director.   Sir BasilSmallpeice, after many years of devoted service to B. C. A. C. ,   has agreed to retire to facilitate the changes.I have carefully considered whether a merger betweenE. O. A. C. and B. E. A. would be in the best interests of Britishaviation but on balance I have decided against it.   I am convinced,however, that the two Corporations need to work more closelytogether than they have in the past.   Sir Giles Guthrie will accordinglyretain his seat as a part-time member of the Board of E. E. A. ; andMr. Anthony Milward, the new Chairman of B.S.A., will alsobecome a part-time member of the Board of B.O. A. C.Before we rose for the Summer Recess I undertook to publish a White Paper about B. O. A. C. &apos;s financial problems.   This white paper will be available in the Vote Office when I sit down.   I will not attempt to summarise it now;  but the House will want to know what steps the Government are taking to put B. O. A. C. on its feetfinancially.   These are set out at the end of the White Paper and arebriefly as follows.First, we have decided to strengthen the management of theCorporation and to appoint as Chairman a man who can remain in thatpost long enough to see the Corporation through the next fewdifficult years.
4 p 4ItuSecond, I a.m inviting the new Chairman to prepare a planduring the coming year for making the Corporation financially sound.When this plan has been considered we can then decide how to dealwith the deficit accumulated by the Corporation and its futurefinancing.Meanwhile, some further losses are likely to arise beforethe new plan can be drawn up and put into practice.   I will, therefore,shortly be asking the House for an extension of the powers I already have under the Air Corporations Act, 19i2, to make loans for thepurpose of financing deficits on Revenue Account.
