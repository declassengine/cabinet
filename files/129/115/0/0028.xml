SECRET AND BMEDIATEPERSONALAPPENDIX1. AS YOU WILL KNOW IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO REACH agreement in COIvMITTEE !A* ON THE SHARES TO BE TAKEN BY THE VARIOUS governments to MEET THE COSTS OP DISSOLUTION.   THIS PUTS AT ^ISK THE *) LARGEPAYMENTS, MOUNTING TO OVER  2 MILLION, WHICH HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BYTHE GOVERNMENTS.    THE GREAT BULK OP THESE ARE LISTED IN THE 39 report of COMMITTEE *A* AND WILL PALL TO BE PAID BftffiDIATBLY AFTER DISSOLUTIONTO THOSE PERSONS WHOSE SiPLOYHENT IN THE CIVIL SERVICE, THE ARMED PORCES,AND THE STATUTORY ORGANISATIONS IS NOT TO BE CONTINUED.2. IT IS WRONG THAT INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE ASKED TO ACCEPT delay in PAYMENT OP SUMS DUE TO THEM WHILE THE GOVERNMENTS, WHOSE representatives have PAILED TO REACH AGREEMENT DESPITE LONG HOURS OP DISCUSSIONS in committee, CONTINUE TO ARGUE OUT THE MATTER.3. THE HONOURING OP THE AGREEMENTS REACHED ON STAPP EXPENTITUREAND OTHER NECESSARY COSTS IS CARDINAL TO AN ORDERLY DISSOLUTION AND ITIS NECESSARY EITHER THAT AGREEMENT BE REACHED BETWEEN THE GOVERIMENTSBEFORE THE END OP - THE YEAR OR THAT A SUM OP MONEY BE MADE AVAILABLE TOMEET THE DISSOLUTION COSTS PENDING A SETTLEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS.4. UNLESS THIS IS DONE CHAOS AND INTOLERABLE HARDSHIP TO INDIVIDUALSCANNOT BE AVOIDED.   I HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS MATTER EXAMINEDVERY SOON.Page 3** corrupt group.
TELEGRAM TO SALISBURY   2o l S     &quot;f^&quot;/^ &amp;AzJ-$Please pass following from the Prime Minister to Sir Roy.Welensky.Thank you for your message of December 4.I am sure you will agree that at this &quot;stage we must,concentrate on the settlement of those matters for which provision needs to he made in the Order in Council.The target date of December 31 for dissolution laid downby the Victoria Falls Conference set a very tight timetable for all Governments.    It has been inevitable in the later stages that drafting of the provisions of the Order inOouncil should be put in hand in parallel with considerationby governments of the various recommendations coming forward from the two Committees in Salisbury.    Foreseeing this        ,necessity, we sent a senior legal adviser to Salisbury inthe middle of November, who has worked on preparation of the.draft Order in consultation throughout with the governmentalrepresentatives on Committee &apos;A&apos;.    We were informed that .-  committee &apos;A&apos; accepted this procedure as,,satisfying the .requirement for consultation with governments within the victoria Falls understanding, provided that a draft of thecomplete Order was available to all Governments for submissio:to Ministers by the weekend of November 30.    The completedraft was furnished to your Government, at the same time asto other Governments, in accordance with this timetable.The Order has been drafted to follow the recommendationsput to Governments by the two Committees.    For example, theprovisions for compensation of Federal Supreme Court Judgesare in accordance with the Sixty-Eighth Report of Committee &apos;j
2 Cj j.A large number of these matters had already been agreed by the Governments .and others have been agreed since the&apos; complete Order was presented.    Among matters which youmention in your telegram, for example, the Northern and southern Rhodesia Governments have agreed to accept theproposals put forward by Committee *B&apos; for future jointoperation of the railways, and division between themselves of the financial liabilities involved.    Similarly, thethree territorial governments have now signed an agreement for the continuation of Central African Airways on the linesprovided for in the draft Order.&apos; I now turn to the question of the apportionment of   -assets and liabilities.    The recommendations in this respectmade in the Sixty-Sixth Report of Committee &apos;A&apos; have now beenaccepted by the territorial governments without modification.The Federal Government representatives attached a minorityreservation to this Report.    Sandys gave you our considered ,views on these reservations through the High Commissioner onDecember 1, and in his further message of December 4indicated that we did not feel able to accept your argumentsregarding the position of the stockholders or of the BritishGovernment in relation to the apportionment of assets and liabilities as between the territories recommended by committee TA&apos;, and saw no1 grounds why that apportionmentshould not proceed.This is acceptable to the other Governments concerned,in the light of understandings reached with them as regardsthe British Government&apos;s readiness to enter into bilateral discussions with them as soon as may conveniently be possible
999!f.i I ) l:with the object of establishing the reasonable needs ofeach territory and the means whereby the burden assumed by each might.be lightened, against the whole&apos; background oftheir financial and economic situation, in accordance withButler&apos;s undertaking in paragraph 27 of the Victoria FallsReport.    The British&apos; Government have agreed that theproblems of refinancing the railway loans will be a matter to be raised and considered in these talks.There are, of course, a number of matters which neednot be immediately settled for the purpose of the Order -for example, outstanding issues as&apos;regards defence assets,v/hich do not affect the Order on the understanding indicatedin paragraph 7 of the Sixty-Sixth Report of Committee &apos;A&apos;.These matters can be resolved through inter-governmentaldiscussion;   arrangements,, for example, are already in trainfor a further meeting to discuss the future of the university college and Medical School.I entirely agree with what you say about the contributiorwhich your Government has made to the effective despatch ofthe work of the dissolution machinery. I hope that in thelight of what I have said you v/ill feel that there has been no failure on our part to consult with you in accordance withthe understandings reached at Victoria Falls and that thereis no need for you to send your Ministers to London.
SECRET AND IMMEDIATE.SERIAL WFRGMs    The Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyaealand&quot;YOU TOLL BE AWAHE THAT ON MONDAY I REQUESTED SANDYS to convene AN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE TO DISCUSS URGENTLY THISWEEK DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS.   I REFERRED IN particular to MAJOR ISSUES SUCH AS THE APPORTIONMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,    .REFINANCING OF RHODESIA RAILWAYS LOANS, FUTURE OF UNIVERSITY college and MEDICAL SCHOOL.   THERE ARE OF COURSE OTHERS SUCH AS the division OF DEFENCE ASSETS AND COMPENSATION TO FEDERAL SUPREMECOURT JUDGES.   THE LAST MENTIONED ARE GRAVELY DISSATISFIED THATTENTATIVE PROPOSALS ARE REFLECTED IN THE DRiFT ORDER IK COUNCILWITHOUT THE AGREEMENT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.&quot;LATE THIS AFTERNOON I RECEIVED A REPLY FROM SANDYS WHICH is most DISTURBING.   IT INDICATES CLEARLY THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT PROPOSESTO PROCEED ON AN ACCEPTANCE OF THE MAJORITY VIEW ON THE APPORTIONMENTOF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHOUT ALL GOVERNMENTS MEETING IN an effort TO RESOLVE THE DISAGREEMENTS.    FURTHERMORE I HAVE HADREPRESENTATIONS FROM A GREAT NUMBER OF LOCAL STOCKHOLDERS DISAGREEINGSTRONGLY WITH THE MAJORITY VTEtf OF COMMITTEE &apos;A* ON ASSETS and liabilities.&quot;I MUST NOW ASK YOU TO GIVE ME A CATEGORICAL STATEMENT whether you INTEND NOTWITHSTANDING THESE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN governments to PROCEED WITH THE ORDER IN COUNCIL YffllCH I HAVE BEEN INFORMED ISIN PROCESS OF PRINTING AND WILL BE LAID BEFORE PARLIAMENT ON Monday next.   I REFER YOU TO AGREEMENT OF ALL GOVERNMENTS AT THE victoria falls CONFERENCE IN PARAGRAPH 57 THAT GOVERtMENTS WOULD BE GIVEN &quot;ANADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY OF COMMENTING ON THE provisions.The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.- Despatched 4&quot;th December,-_  1963._._^/You will
SECRET AND IMMEDIATE.9 9 MS&quot;YCU WIUi OBSERVE THAT THE PARAGRAPH REFERS TO AGREED decisions and WE WBSB GIVEN SIGHT OF A HOUGH DRAFT OF THE ORDER IN COUNCIL ONLYCN SUNDAY.   THE DRAFT CONTAINED MANY PROVISIONS WHICH ARE NOT agreed and WHICH EVEN AT THIS STAGE ARE STILL IN SQUARE BRACKETS.   A NUMBER OF   &apos;AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE DRAFT SINCE MONDAY, BUT WE HAVE HAD NOSIGHT OF THEM.&quot;TO PROCEED TO AN ORDER IN COUNCIL ON ALL THESE WITHOUT GOVERN-MENTS BEING GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFER TOGETHER WOULD BE A BREACH OFAN AGREEMENT REACHED AT THE VICTORIA FALLS CONFERENCE.   IT WAS THENCLEARLY UNDERSTOOD THAT FAILING AGREEMENT AMONGST GOVERNMENTS REGARDINGDISSOLUTION ARRANGEMENTS A FURTHER MEETING OF GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE CALLED.&quot;I REGARD THE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH APPEAR TO BE TAKING PLACE ASEXTREMELY SERIOUS AND UNLESS I HAVE YOUR ASSURANCE THAT GOVERNMENTS WILLBE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THEIR DISAGREEMENTS BEFORE THE order is LAID I SHALL BE FORCED TO TAKE THE STRONGEST ACTION I CAN.&quot;I HAD HOPED TO SEE THE DISSOLUTION EXERCISE THROUGH WITHOUTTHE NECESSITY FOR MY GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ANY DISAGREEABLE ACTION AND TO THISEND BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS OFFICIALS HAVE ASSISTED THE DISSOLUTIONMACHINERY TO THE GREATEST POSSIBLE EXTENT TO ENSURE THE ORDERLY TRANSFEROF FUNCTIONS.   I SHALL BE COMPELLED TO CONSIDER AMONGST OTHER ACTIONSDELAYING THE PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT SO THAT I CAN INFORM THE country of THE POSITION.   SO AS TO OBVIATE THESE LONG RANGE EXCHANGES I AM WILLINGTO SEND MY MINISTERS OF LAW AND FINANCE GREENFIELD AND CALDICOTT TO LONDONIMMEDIATELY TO DISCUSS THE MATTER.&quot;(SIGNED)     &quot;ROY WELENSKY&quot;Rhodesia House,429 The Strand,London, W.C.2.5th December, 1963*
