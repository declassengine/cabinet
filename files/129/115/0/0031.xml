THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTAGRICULTURAL POLICY: CEREALS AND FATSTOCKMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food should like to consult my colleagues on the next phase in the discussions which have been taking place with the N.F.U. and our overseas suppliers in the adaptation of the support system for agriculture along the lines I announced withthe approval of the Cabinet on 22nd May (C.C. (63) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 7).2. Our policy is to retain our present system of support, but to improve itin the light of present-day requirements. This system suits us well as a tradingnation with a relatively small proportion of the population engaged in agriculture.Its main defect, from the national point of view, is that the commitment on theExchequer is an open-ended one on two accounts, both from the instability anddepression of the market because of the pressure and the phasing of excessivesupplies, from both home and overseas; and from the fact that in the two bigsectors of cereals and fatstock the guarantee applies to an unlimited quantity ofhome production. To remedy this we have said that we must have greater stability in the market, and that this requires the regulation of imports, either by quantityor price, coupled with some regulation of home production.3. Because of our international commitments, both bilateral and in GATT,we must try to secure the necessary regulation of imports by agreement with our main suppliers. This means that our policy objectives must broadly be acceptable to them. Moreover, in view of the importance to us of the Kennedy Roundnegotiations and the insistence of the United States and other exporters thatagriculture should be covered in those negotiations, it is important that our objectives, so far as they bear on international trade in temperate agricultural commodities, should be constructive and reasonable. We have therefore said thatour aim is to maintain a reasonable balance between home production and imports,and that in determining this balance we should start from broadly the present levelof supplies and the present proportions of our market which are supplied from home production and imports. We have also said that our aim is to give both our home producers and our overseas suppliers the opportunity of sharing in thegrowth of the market, but we have also made it clear that the balance between home supplies and imports must be subject to review in the light of changes in the pattern of supply, and in marketing conditions, including changes in the relative efficiency of suppliers in meeting consumer demand.4. Hitherto our &quot; open door&quot; policy for foodstuffs has been extendedvirtually to any country who wished to export to us. In recent years with growingworld surpluses and ourselves being the only country to allow free imports, our market has increasingly been used as a convenience for high-cost producing countries to offload their surpluses. Thus our free market system has meant thatour farmers have been selling in competition not merely with our traditionaleconomic suppliers like Canada and New Zealand, but also with surpluses fromhigh cost producers which are dumped on our market with the aid of subsidies.The farming community has therefore welcomed the Governments intention tocontrol imports and recent introduction of the Bill to give us power to lay downminimum import prices and impose levies if necessary. The counterpart that theremust be restraint on home production is naturally less welcome to them, thoughPrinted for the Cabinet. December 1963CP. (63) 3110th December, 1963CABINET
the more responsible recognise that, if v/e are to get the agreement of our overseas suppliers to the control of imports, there must be some contribution to the stability of the market from our own domestic supplies. The anxiety springsfundamentally from the fact that in past years much of the increase in agriculturalincomes has come from higher production, and from increases in productivitywhich can often only be secured if they are allowed to expand their farmingoperations. They therefore see any change in the guarantee arrangements whichwould discourage greater production, as a threat to their prospects of improving the relation between agricultural incomes and those of the rest of the community,a relationship which they already regard as unsatisfactory. This, of course, isnot a problem unique to this country; nor is it one created by our latest proposals.On the contrary, unless production is related more closely to the needs of themarket, in the long run farmers will only get less and less from the market for producing more and more, and the system of guaranteed prices will becomeinsupportable.5. Much of the discussion with the farmers&apos; leaders in recent weeks havebeen taken up with this problem. Without commitment we have tried to workout a statement of our objectives and the implications which they carry for thefuture growth of home production and the income position to producers, whichwould be acceptable to them. The Annex to this paper contains a draft statement,in the form which represents the best we could get from the Governments pointof view but which would at the same time be the most which the farmers&apos; leaderswould find it possible to accept. It is of course angled presentationally to thehome producers&apos; interests; but if they could be induced to accept this, they wouldbe accepting the need to regulate home production to the level of standard quantities which would reflect the necessary balance between home productionand imports, and they would be accepting the need for the standard quantities to be effective for this purpose. Whether the farmers&apos; leaders will in the end accept such a definition of our objectives will depend on their attitude to the particulararrangements we want for cereals and meat which are discussed below.6. I would like to include a statement on these lines in the Annual review white Paper to be published in March 1964. We should make the minimum of amendments to it in the reasonable expectation that the N.F.U. will find it hard to take exception to it. Meanwhile, we can take this statement as a basis for our overseas negotiations.Cereals7. On the international front there seems a reasonable prospect of securingthe co-operation of our major overseas suppliers, namely the United States, Canada,the Argentine and Australia. We have just had a reply from the Americans whichsays that while they are worried about the practical effects on their interests of theminimum import price arrangements, they would nevertheless be prepared toco-operate if certain conditions can be fulfilled. The most important of these is some assurance on access. They recognise the importance to them, both in the short term and in the longer term GATT discussions, of our basic objective of maintaining areasonable balance between home production and imports, with both having theopportunity to share in future growth. But they naturally want something more inthe nature of an assurance than a mere declaration of our policy objective, and theyhave asked that we should commit ourselves to corrective action if our policyobjectives are not being achieved, and also that we should be prepared to considermore far-reaching commitments in the longer term GATT discussions.8. I should be loth to go as far as this in bilateral agreements if we canavoid it, although such a commitment might not be unreasonable in the context of an international cereals agreement in which other countries are acceptingparallel obligations. I have, therefore, authorised a reply saying that we would beprepared in any exchange of letters to define our policy objectives; to relatethese to the longer term objectives which are being sought in the GATT; and toundertake to review at appropriate intervals, in consultation with those overseas suppliers co-operating with us. the extent to which our policy objectives are,having regard to all relevant factors, being achieved. I hope that this will besufficient to satisfy not onlv the Americans, but also the Canadians and theArgentinians from whom we are expecting replies along similar lines to that fromthe United States. I would also hope that such an assurance would induce
h eJSECRET3Australia to reconsider her earlier reluctance to co-operate. But if such an assurance is to satisfy our major overseas suppliers we shall have to be able to convince them that what we are proposing to do on the regulation of home production is reasonably likely to achieve our objectives.9. Apart from this major point which is likely to be crucial in securing agreement, there may also be a number of less important but difficult technical problems on the minimum import price arrangements which will have to be resolved, for example the treatment of wheat flour, and how we should deal withthe preference question. If we can get our four major suppliers to agree in principle to co-operate, I would propose to have a multilateral conference with them inJanuary to resolve any outstanding technical questions.10. If, as I hope, we are able in these ways to secure the co-operation of ourfour major suppliers, we should I think be prepared to take a strong line withother less important suppliers such as France to whom we have not got the samecontractual obligations as to the others.11. As regards home production, our original idea had been to determinea standard quantity for the main cereals such as we already have for pigs, whereby the guarantee price is automatically reduced with progressive severity if productionexceeds the stated quantity and, conversely, is increased if production falls short.The standard quantity arrangement in this form is unacceptable to the Farmers&apos;Unions because they regard it as excessively penal. They have put forward analternative arrangement which, while still imposing an absolute limit on theExchequer liability under the guarantee, would have the advantage, from their point of view, of allowing some increase in farmers&apos; gross returns if productionincreases beyond the standard quantity but the market nevertheless remains firm.12. I believe we can go along with this concept though the details have still to be thrashed out. Moreover, we still have to reach agreement with them onthe level of the standard quantity, about which we cannot be too forthcomingwithout prejudicing our overseas negotiations. The Farmers&apos; Unions are alsoinsisting that we should make some progress with marketing proposals whichthey have put forward designed to help farmers to get the best out of the market.Some of their ideas may not be welcome to the cereals trades. It may well bedifficult to make rapid progress on the marketing front, but we must do our best. I would not think that our failure to settle upon marketing arrangements bythe time of the price review would give the Unions ground for rejecting the policy as a whole.13. On cereals, therefore, while I cannot yet advise my colleagues that wehave reached agreement, either with our overseas suppliers or with the farmers&apos;leaders, I believe there is a reasonable prospect that we shall do so. My chiefanxiety is that so little time remains to settle all the outstanding points beforethe February price review, at which we should have to decide on the final standard quantity arrangements. We shall be having intensive discussions on both frontsand I may have to ask my colleagues to deal swiftly with particular issues thatmay arise calling for Ministerial decision.14. We certainly cannot exclude the possibility that we may not be able tosecure the agreement of our main overseas suppliers, or of the farmers&apos; leaders.In my view it would not be advisable, in view of our international circumstances and obligations, to impose a minimum import price system on our overseas suppliersunless we were prepared to accompany this with the effective regulation of home production, either by agreement with farmers&apos; leaders or by imposing it on them.I would regard the arrangements described in paragraph 11, coupled with the kindof assurance on access I propose as constituting a reasonable balance between home production and imports, which I do not believe either the farmers&apos; leaders or our overseas suppliers would be justified in refusing. I therefore invite my colleagues toagree that we should push forward with the plan for cereals, even to the point of imposing it on our own farmers or on our overseas suppliers, or both.15. Meat, as we knew it would, has proved even more difficult than cereals.Because of the nature of the commodity we have had to reject the approach by wayof minimum import prices. My colleagues will recall the discussions we had on thispoint last May (C.C. (63) 28th Conclusions, Minute 4). We have, therefore, had toMeat
think in terms of a quantitative agreement, with the imposition of import quotasas the possible sanction rather than a minimum imports price supported as necessary by levies. We were able in November to secure a multilateral agreement inquantitative terms with our major suppliers of bacon. We have also, during thecourse of the year, been able to get the Argentine Government temporarily toagree to limit their shipments of beef to this market. This, however, was on an ad hoc basis and the Argentine Government have said that they would not be willing to continue such an arrangement beyond the 1st April next year unless it also applied to other overseas suppliers and there was equally some restraint on home production.16. Nevertheless there are signs that the Argentine and our other majorsuppliers (with the important exception of the Irish Republic) would consider, forthe longer term, voluntary restrictions on the level of their exports, but only inreturn for an effective control on the level of home production. An essential element of an arrangement in quantitative terms is that we must be able to satisfy our overseas suppliers that we are able to hit reasonably near the centre the target setfor home production. In order to do this it is evident that we should need to impose a scheme of restriction on home production more rigorous than anything the farmers Unions would accept.17. The Farmers Unions oppose the standard quantity proposals that wehave put to them on the ground that meat is less in world surplus or potential surplusthan cereals. Whether they believe this or not they are in fact impelled by theirgreater anxiety over the future prospects of income for livestock producers. This,in part, explains why the Scottish N.F.U. have been more vigorously opposed torestriction of home production than the other Farmers Unions, for beef and lambare vital to the Scottish agricultural economy. The Unions also make much of thelong production cycle of beef and the need to make improvements in marketing(on which we await the advice of Sir Reginald Verdon Smith&apos;s Committee) asreasons for not accepting any immediate restraints on home production.18. The situation we have reached therefore, is that there seems no prospectof reaching agreement with our farmers on any arrangements for 1964 that wouldmean effective regulation of home production for meat. This means that, unless weimpose our proposals on the N.F.Us, we cannot reach agreement with our overseas suppliers on any effective control of imports.19. Despite the difficulties, I am sure we cannot abandon our proposalsaltogether. We have told Parliament and the country that to get stability in the meat market we need a measure of import control. Nothing has happened since may to suggest that what we then thought necessary to prevent the Exchequer billrising to unacceptable levels (as it did in 1961 and looked like doing again in the spring of this year) no longer obtains.20. One course would be to press ahead with our plans as they stand. Wecould decide to impose at the next Price Review a rigorous standard quantityarrangement, which would effectively control production and limit the Exchequerliability. This would undoubtedly provoke considerable hostility from the farming community but, by doing this, we should put ourselves in a position where wecould arrange an equally tight control of imports. We should obviously go as faras we could in securing the regulation of imports by agreement with our overseas suppliers but we should have to be ready to impose it if necessary. If we had todo that, it might involve the denunciation of specific commitments to commonwealth countries. It would also put us in breach of our generalobligations under the GATT, although we could no doubt argue that our proposals,taken as a whole, were reasonable ones. We also have specific commitments tothe Irish Republic, though we might conceivably be able to exclude her from thearrangement on the grounds of her special relationship with us.21. The alternative would seem to be, while adhering to our objectives forthe longer term, to limit ourselves for the time being to introducing suchimprovements in our fatstock guarantee arrangements as we can induce the farmers&apos; leaders to accept and then to make the best arrangements we can with our foreign suppliers.22. As an interim arrangement we might ask our overseas suppliers toagree that, in the general interest both of importers and home producers, thereshould be a standing body which would discuss the level and phasing of supplies
SECRET5on to the United Kingdom market. We should indicate to this body what thevolume of home produced meat in 1964 would be, and what was therefore themaximum amount of imports which the market could take without prices beingdepressed. We would not, of course, be securing any absolute control over thevolume of imports, but we should be able to make representations to any supplierwhose exports appeared likely to be excessive. We should make the most of the changes we were bringing about in our own guarantee arrangements, particularly as the main emphasis in the work of such a body would be on the phasing ofsupplies. I would hope that we could arrange a meeting on these lines in January.If any country should appear intent on sending us quantities that were obviouslyexcessive in relation to the general market situation-and I have in mind here a country like France I would not rule out the possibility that we should beprepared to impose quantitative restrictions on imports from such a country. Itshould be possible to represent arrangements of this kind as an extension of thearrangements we have made with the Argentine this year.23. To explain why we were not introducing standard quantities, we shouldhave to say that meat, as we always knew, was a more difficult commodity to dealwith than cereals, and in fact it had not been possible in the limited time availableto make the necessary arrangements in a way which would be fair both to our home and to our overseas producers. We would adhere to our policy for regulatingsupplies from home and overseas as our longer term objective.24. I therefore invite my colleagues to consider whether we should conductour further negotiations with the farmers&apos; leaders and with our overseas meatsuppliers on the basis (a) that, despite the present attitude of the farmers&apos; leaders, we would imposesuitable standard quantity arrangements for fatstock at the next price review and introduce quantitative control of imports, if possible byagreement with our major suppliers, but if necessary by the impositionof country quotas; or(b) that, while adhering to our policy objective for the longer term, we should in the short term make only such changes in our domestic guarantee arrangements as would be acceptable to the farmers&apos; leaders and inviteour overseas suppliers to co-operate with us in the phasing of supplies on to the United Kingdom market in 1964.C.

AnnexMARKET SHARING OBJECTIVE AND INCOME ASSURANCEThe Governments policy is to ensure the ability of the agricultural industryto develop its prosperity by preserving the present system of support whilstmaking the necessary adaptations to present-day circumstances. In this respectthey will have regard to the economic and social importance of British agricultureand to the special nature of the industry. The Government reiterate that it is their responsibility to maintain conditions which afford the industry the opportunityof a reasonable standard of living for farmers and farm workers and an adequatereturn on capital. In pursuing this objective they will have regard to their intention that agricultural producers should be able to share in the growing prosperity ofthe community generally.In December 1960 the White Paper on Agriculture (Cmnd. 1249) referred tothe agreement between the Government and the Unions that &quot; . . . as the industrystrengthens its competitive power and so advances towards its declared objective of reducing Exchequer support to the minimum practicable amount, it is right and proper that it should have the incentive and reward of an increase in itsliving standards &quot;. In the same document, the Government assured the industry that it intended, taking one year with another, to leave farmers with a share ofthe gain from increasing efficiency which should be reflected in their incomes.At recent Reviews the determination of the guarantees has been influenced by the rising level and unpredictability of Exchequer cost arising from instabilityin market prices. This in turn has been due to the pressure on our market of total supplies, including imports, and also to the fact that, in general, while imports are unregulated, it is more difficult to improve the phasing and marketing of home supplies.It is in the interests of the industry that the guarantee arrangements shouldbe such that, when the level of the guaranteed prices has been settled at the annual review, the cost to the Exchequer can be kept within control and determined with greater precision. Greater stability in the market is particularly necessary for cereals and fatstock and this requires effective control of imports or import prices combined with standard quantities on home production. If imports are to be regulated, our overseas suppliers should have reasonable assurances about their opportunities of access to our market. The Government intends to couple import regulation witheffective arrangements for relating home production to market needs.The regulation of imports, coupled with the regulation of home production,of cereals and fatstock, makes it possible to tackle the problem of improving the phasing and marketing of the home product. If this is to be achieved, it will involvethe improved planning of the individual farmer&apos;s output. The Government aretherefore exploring, in conjunction with producer representatives and other interests,ways of giving effect to these objectives.The Governments aim is to maintain a reasonable balance between home production and imports.-In determining this balance, the Government must startfrom broadly the present level of supplies and the present proportions of our market which are supplied from home production (including output already in the courseof production) and imports.As regards the growth in the market which can be expected on account ofthe increase in population and the rise in living standards, British farmers willhave the opportunity of securing a proper share in this. Moreover, the government recognise that British farmers, by virtue of their increasing productivity, will aim to secure an increasing share of their own market. Apart from adjustments dueto the natural growth of the market, the Government will in any case wish to review from time to time the balance between home production and imports inthe light of changes in supply and marketing conditions, including changes in
SECRET7the relative efficiency of suppliers in meeting consumer demand. This means that,as the industry strengthens its competitive power, British farmers should have theopportunity to secure an increasing share of a growing home market.The standard quantities (which will reflect &quot; that part of the nation&apos;s foodwhich it is in the national interest to produce at home &quot;) will be determined at each Annual Review, taking account of the growth in the market as a whole andany changes necessary as a result of reviewing the balance between home production and imports. These standard quantities will set the level within whichproduction should broadly be contained for the period under review which, forcertain commodities, might cover a longer period ahead than one year.The Governments intention is that the new arrangements for import controland for standard quantities should be effective in relating home and overseassupplies to the needs of the market and in ensuring a proper balance betweenhome production and imports. On the assumption that these objectives are achieved, the Government will be able, in determining the basic guaranteed prices at Annual Reviews, to give greater weight to the level of farmers&apos; returns than would have been possible in the absence of these new arrangements.
