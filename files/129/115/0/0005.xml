iilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S government cp. (63) 5 COPY NO. ^_29th October, 1963CABINETHlLL,CO&apos;W SUBSIDYMemorandum by the Ministeriof Agriculture,Fisheries and FoodMy colleagues asked me to consider whether, instead of withdrawing this subsidy in 1965 from those farmers made ineligibleas a result of the recent survey, the conditions of entitlement tothe subsidy could be re-defined, or alternatively payment continued for a longer period (C.C(63) 56th Conclusions, Minute 5).2,     I have considered altering the conditions of entitlement.The difficulty is this.    Under the present scheme a claimant mustsatisfy three conditions:-(a) His farm must be in the 27 named &quot;hill&quot;comities (see Annex).(b) It must be in an area predominantly consistingof mountain, hill or heath.(c) Finally, it must also be unsuitable for anyfarming activity other than livestock rearing.3.      There can, of course, be no question of amending condition(a).    I can see no way of amending condition (c) so as to admit all,or even the majority, of the 1, 700 farmers now at risk withoutopening the flood gates to many other farmers who have never hadthe subsidy and have no reasonable claim to it, since their land canbe put to other farming uses.4.     The only solution I can see is to amend condition (b).    Wehave in any case to introduce a new scheme after this year and thiswill involve a statutory instrument to define eligibility for subsidyafter 31st December.    In this we could leave out condition (b) andrely on conditions (a) and (c) alone.    In other words, we wouldgive the subsidy to any farm in the 27 counties which was unsuitable for dairying, fattening or cash cropping and so fitted only for livestock rearing.-1-
5.      If we took this line, the effect would be as follows.    As aresult of the recent survey we were due to exclude some 1, 700farmers from the subsidy.    Cf these I estimate that about one-third would qualify for subsidy under a revised scheme.    Thisleaves us, say, 1,200 farmers, though perhaps about a third ofthem would have no more than three cows (equals  36 a yearsubsidy) so that their loss could not be treated as serious.   Further,a number of farmers hitherto ruled out by condition (b) wouldbecome eligible.    It is difficult to say how many newcomers mightbenefit until applications can be invited and inspected;  but our bestguess is that the annual cost might be of the order of  600, 000,assuming the concession is confined to the 27 hill counties.Necessary corresponding amendments to the schemes affectingScotland and Northern Ireland might cost another  1 million.6.     Apart from the cost, the difficulty about this solution isthat it would create a further anomaly since you could then havetwo farms which were equally unsuitable for any farming activityother than livestock rearing (condition (c)), but just because one was in a I:hill&quot; county it would get the subsidy whereas the other in a neighbouring count&quot;/ would not.7.      The only alternative is to stick to the existing definition andstand the racket.8.      I invite my colleagues to decide whether I should:-(a) make a new scheme as suggested in paragraph 4abovej   or(b) implement the recommendations I originallymade in C. (63) 157 to remove the 1, 700farms from subsidy though allowing payment to be made in 1964.C   ciMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S. 17. 1.29th October, 19632CONFIDENTIAL
