Inflation (Temporary Provisions)DRAFTOF ABILLTo authorise measures to meet inflation.CCCXXXIX B (2)2nd November, 19726 1 (381519) 45/3
BRiPT WHITE PAPEROA PROGRAMME FOR CONTROLLING INFLATION:    THE FIRST STAGE1.     Since July the Government has had a series of meetings withthe CBI and the TUC on the objectives of economic management andon the methods by which those objectives should be pursued over thenext 12 months.   Agreement was reached on three objectives.:    the needfor faster growth in national output and real incomes, for animprovement in the relative position of the low paid and for moderationin the rate of cost and price inflation.    The Government put forward proposals for achieving these objectives on 26 September, but it became clear by/November that it was not possible to reach agreement on ways of red\icing the rate of inflation.    The Prime Ministerannounced in a statement to the House of Commons on  &quot;   J   november that the Government had concluded that it was necessary to bring in statutory measures to secure the agreed objectives.2.     in the course of his statement the Prime Minister explainedthat the Government would introduce legislation as soon as it couldbe prepared to.provide for separate monitoring machinery.for prices and for pay.   Ministers would be,, able to refer proposed price or pay increases to the appropriate body and direct that any increase which -failed to secure its approval should not take place.    Guidance wouldbe issued by the Government on the appropriate rate of price and pay increases and on the considerations which should apply to them.This guidance would be related to the agreed objectives and theGovernment intended that it should in the first instance followbroadly the pattern of the proposals made by the Government in the tripartite talks.   Provision would be made in the legislation for both sides of industry to be represented on the monitoring bodies.
ijt    Powers would also bo taken to limit dividend distributions,   -/&quot;*? Reference to rents^4.r)  As it will take time to work out the powers and machinery-necessary to achieve this, the Prime Minister announced that theGovernment would propose a standstill for an interim period onincreases in prices, /&quot;rents^j dividends and pay.    The standstillwill operate from /   J November.   An interim Bill will be introduced to give Ministers powers to enforce the standstill.    The Bill will propose that these powers should run for 90 days from enactmentin the first instance but with provision for an extension by affirmative Resolution Order of up to a further 60 days to ensurethat the standstill lasts until the longer term legislationreceives the Royal Assent.5.    This White Paper describes how the standstill is to beapplied during this interim period.TRICES AND CHARGES  -6.    The standstill applies to prices and charges for goods and services whether provided by the private or the public sector,including increases which have been announced hut not implementedby  &quot; JJ November.7.    The Government recognises that the imposition of a standstillwill present problems for some enterprises, notably for those membersof the CBI and the nationalised industries which have alreadyobserved a 15 month period of price restraint.   However, enterpriseswill he required to absorb cost increases to the maximum extent possible, and exception; will generally be confined to cases wherethe importance of the costs of imported raw materials or of certainfresh foods whose supply varies.seasonally makes this impracticable.Further guidance on this is given in Annex I.secret
8*-^   Outside these limited categories, enterprises which&quot; considerthat their costs (either import costs or domestic costs) have risenso far that it is impracticable for them to be absorbed will need tosubmit details to the relevant Government Department and obtain itsconsent, or run the .risk of having price increases reversed bynotice or order under the interim Bill.    Such proposals will be strictly scrutinised.    Agreement will generally be confined to caseswhere increased costs cannot be absorbed by increased productivityor a temporary reduction in profit margins.   Y/holesalers should &quot;not increase their cash margins during the standstill.9.     The Government intend that the principles of the standstillshall apply to the prices of the nationalised industries, and to central Government fees and charges, except to the extent that the steel industry may require to adjust its prices under its obligations to. the European Goal and Steel Community.PRICE FIXING BODIES       &apos;&apos;10.   Statutorily established price fixing bodies such as the traffic Commissioners and the Civil Aviation Authority will besubject to the principles of the standstill.RATES11.   Local rates are a tax, not a price.   But the Government will consult the local authorities in the forthcoming rate support grant discussions with a view to moderating the rate of growth oflocal rates, since rates enter into &quot;both household ^f&quot;and industrialJSECRET
RENTS12      The rents charged by local authorities and new towns aregoverned by the Housing Finance Act 1972 and the correspondingScottish Act.   Under these Acts the tenants of these authoritiesare.covered &quot;by rebate schemes from 1 October 1972, and mostauthorities were required to increase the rents of their dwellingsfor 1972/73 in October 1972.   As these rent increases were due totake place before the standstill they are not affected &quot;by it andany authorities v/ho have not so far discharged this statutory&quot;obligation v/ill not be relieved of it by the standstill.13      ^Further increases in local authority rents under the housing finance Act are not due until.1 April 1973 and the Government expect that this will be after the 90 day standstill period.   However theGovernment propose to increase rent rebates and allowances for both public authority and private tenants in a way which will in airy eventlimit the effect of the April 1973 rent increases for those tenantsleast able to afford them OR However, the powers in the interim bill would be wide enough to allow the Government to defer or modify the april 1973 rent increases if the standstill.were still in force,./14     ^/&quot;About half of the tenants of private unfurnishedaccommodation are at present subject to rent control.   Some of the mare due to move from control to regulation on 1 January 1973 and tobe liable to have their rent increased if a fair rent is subsequentlyregistered for their dwelling.   The Government will by order postponethis date to the end of the standstill period.   For those private tenants whose rent is regulated and who are thus already within the fair rent system, and for tenants of housing associations who come within that system on 1 January 1973, legislation will provide that
Qny fair rent registered during the standstill which is higher thanthe existing rent will, not take effect until the end of the standstill./-15      Z&quot;Tiie rent of furnished accommodation v/ill be subject to the standstill^16      /&quot;The rent of business premises and land has a direct effecton the price of many goods and services, and unlike housing rentsthese rents are subject neither to statutory controls nor to rebateprovisions.   It is intended that they should be subject to .the standstill provisions^INCOMES - .Employment Incomes17      The standstill applies to all increases in pay and to other -improvements in, the terms and conditions of employment, eg hours andholidays, /&quot;though not to occupational pensions^o   All concerned inthe determination of pay and other conditions of employment in boththe public and private sectors, whether at industry, company or plantlevel, will be subject to the requirements of the standstill, as willarbitrators, independent review bodies and statutory wage fixingbodies.18      The term &quot;pay&quot; covers all rates of pay.   In addition to the basic rate, this includes rates of. pay for overtime or weekend work,piece rates and all allowances which are normally considered as pay.19      The standstill will not apply to increases in pay resultingdirectly from extra effort or output under existing arrangementsf egincreases in piece work earnings stemming from increased output,commissions on sales, or necessary increases in overtime.   Nor willit apply, to increases arising from genuine promotion;
o .... &apos;   ../&quot;to cases where under existing arrangements the rate of pay is expressed in terms of a predetermined incremental range or-scale/;&apos;or of course to direct reimbursement of expenditure incurred, egtravel and subsistence allowancesoExisting Agreements20      In all cases where a settlement was reached before      JNovember, and the operative date of the increase v/as on or before that date, the increase can.be implemented*&apos; \21    ^However there will be some agreements made before   JNovember which provide for specified increases in pay or improvements in other conditions to take effect, from an operative date falling within the period of the standstill.   The operative date of such increases will be deferred until the standstill comes to. an end. this requirement applies, inter alia, to any increases which may fall dueduring the standstill under existing cost of living sliding scalearrangements.   Accordingly the Bill protects employers from any liability for breach of their contractual obligations under these agreements until the end of the standstill^Wages Councils and Boards22       &quot;Proposals from Wages Councils and Boards made on or beforeCJ7 November but not yet submitted to the Minister or embodied in a statutory order may also be implemented if the previous order wasmade twelve months before that dateJJArbitration Awards23   .  &quot;Arbitration awards may be implemented during the standstillif the relevant hearings were completed on or before  &quot;&quot;J november and the operative date was not later than that date^/6
SEC RE TNegotiations during Standstill2Z+      If negotiations or arbitrations take place during the standstillany increase resulting from an agreement must not take effect beforethe end of the standstill period and will in any case he subject tothe policy which is. then in operation.Other Employment Incomes25      Many individual salaries and other forms of remuneration &quot;are not determined through collective bargaining.   The standstill will applyto these forms of employment income.   It will apply also to charges and fees (including all forms of professional fees) for services byself-employed persons-.Deferred Increases26     ^/&quot;Where pay increases or improvements in conditions negotiated orsubmitted to arbitration before the standstill are deferred until theend of the standstill:- .i if the original operative date was after      J November1972, the increase or improvement will take effect from-.: the end of the standstillii -    if the. original operative date, was earlier than 8 November1972, the increase will take effect from .the end of the standstill and any increase relating to the period ended/T J November 1972 will be paidt /rDIVIDENDS27     The standstill will apply to the declaration or payment of dividends &quot;by companies incorporated in the United Kingdom.   During the
0 &apos; -standstill period companies will be required to keep their dividendpayments (whether final or interim) at a level which is not in excess,of that paid in the corresponding payment in the same calendar perioda year ago.   This will apply equally to dividends declared before andafter  &quot; J November, if they are to be paid during the standstill.Because of their special character the standstill will not be appliedto investment trusts or to certain companies such as close companies to the extent that they increase distributions in order to comply withthe special tax rules.   The Treasury will be issuing furtherexplanatory guidance to. assist companies.THE POWERS28      In support of the standstill, the Bill will give Ministers powersto make orders or issue notices directing that incomes or prices and before ^charges should not exceed the levels prevailing        J November,This will enable unjustified increases which take place during the standstill period to be reversed.   It is the Governments intention that before making a direction the Minister would normally give     Jdays advance notice to the person affected and would consider any representations made within that time.   The direction would not be retrospective.   The Bill will also provide for fines in cases where an individual or firm fails to comply with a direction to reduceincomes, prices, charges or dividends and where a trades union,employers association or other person takes industrial action designedto force an increase to be made which would be contrary to the standstill.
5       &quot;&quot;List of raw materials/0 ANNEX\     /For the reason explained in the tripartite talkj?7 it is notpossible to control rigidly the price of unprocessed agricultural produce such as fruit, vegetables, meat and fish.   These prices are&apos;volatile because the supply situation, both in the UK and in worldcommodity markets, varies widely at different seasons and becauseprices are often fixed by auctions or similar market processes *   TheMinistry of Agriculture will keep in close touch with the relevanttrades and distributors and ensure/that the undertakings the latterhave given in the context of the tripartite talks not only on thesefresh foods but on other foodsare observed in the standstill/.2       The prices of certain raw materials other than food which are determined in world commodity markets are also volatile.   But thesefdo not affect consumer prices directly.   These are listed in paragraphbelow. &quot;3       Enterprises whose plaices are increased as a direct result offluctuations in the prices of these products will not be expected toobtain specific consent for such increases.h      Distributors will not need to apply for consent if consent hasalready been obtained by. a manufacturer or by some other enterprisehandling the product at an earlier stage.   In considering anapplication from a distributor, Departments will not wish to interferewith the normal and beneficial practice of making temporary reductions in prices.
secret&apos;29Q The Bii:L vvi11 give the Ministers concerned discretion to defer the effective dates of wages regulation orders made under the wages councils Act and the Agricultural Wages Act.   It will also protectfrom legal proceedings employers who, in conformity With the standstill,(withhold pay increases to which an employee is entitled under his contract of employment.?30     The Bill will enable orders or notices to he made to prohibita company from declaring or paying a dividend higher than the dividendcalendar it-paid in the corresponding/period in the previous year.   The Bill willI provide powers to make orders to prevent increases in rents above thatpayable on or before      J November.
