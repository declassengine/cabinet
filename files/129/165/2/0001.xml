THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(?2) 102 COPY NO      655 October 1972CABINETDEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION - PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST:DRAFT WHITE paper note by the Secretary of State for the environment, At the meeting of the Home and Social Affairs Committee on14 September, I was invited to complete the drafting of the White paper on Development and Compensation in the light of the points made and to circulate it to the Cabinet.2, The revised draft White Paper is now attached.    In the absence ofany comments from my colleagues, I will assume that the Paper has their approval, and I will arrange to have it published, subject to final minordrafting amendment, on Tuesday 17 October.P w department of the Environment5 October 1972
CONFIDENTIALDEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION - PUTTING PEOPLE FIRSTCHAPTER 1    THE NEW APPROACH1.   The Government is committed to enhancing the quality of everydaylife in Britain.,    In doing so a balance must constantly be struckbetween the overriding duty of the State to ensure that essentialdevelopments are undertaken for the benefit of the whole community and the no less compelling need to protect the interests of those whose personal rights or private property may be injured in theprocess .2o   This dilemma is at the heart of contemporary political debate.Sometimes the State is seen as- playing the role of a juggernaut,putting roads before homes, riding rough shod over the rights of individual citizens,,    At other times, the private owner is condemnedfor &quot;selfishly&quot; holding up a much needed development0   Yet nearlyalways, the conflict is not between public (or private) right and private [or public) wrong0    It is a conflict of right x^ith right - thepublicJs undoubted right to have a new road or school or waterworksand the private person&apos;s right to enjoy his home and garden,undisturbed.3.   As population increases and living standards rise, conflicts ofthis kind are increasing in number and intensity.   All of us wantfreedom to travel by car and aeroplane and we want good publicservicesj at the same time none of us   is content to lose our home, orto live within sight, sound and smell of heavy traffic, or to endurethe roar of aircraft overhead.   Yet providing the community with theservices it wants is coming to mean just this for increasing numbersof peopleo   Not surprisingly they resent it.I4..   Since the Government took office, two major far ranging studies of this subject have been completed.   They deal with ways to preventdamage and, when full prevention is impracticable,, how to compensate for itf    One is the comprehensive report which has been prepared bythe Urban Motorways Committee, set up t-o examine and review present policies used in fitting major roads into urban areas.   Their mainONFIDENTIAl
report has now been published-::- and a full supporting technical report will be published by the turn of the year.   The other is a full scalereview of the compensation code which applies when public developmentrequires that land and homes must be taken, where the prospect ofsuch development creates problems of blight and where that development depreciates the value of neighbouring property.5o   Both these studies, which were closely related and interlocked intheir final stages, have given clear priorities for the steps whichmust now be taken.    The Government believe the time has come when allconcerned with development must aim to achieve a better balance betweenprovision for the community as a x-jhole and the mitigation of harmfuleffects on the individual citizen.    In recent years this balance intoo many cases has been tipped against the interests of the individual.A better deal is now required for those who suffer from desirablecoiwuunity developments e    The Government is determined to provide thisbetter deal.6,.   The answer is not to stop community developments that make lifemore comfortable, convenient and pleasant.   To do that would simplydeprive many people of the opportunity of a better environment.    the answer must be to plan new developments so as to minimise the disturbance and disruption they can cause, and to improve thecompensation code to alleviate any remaining distress.7.   Eight principles underlie the Governments proposalsi0     Harmful impact on the immediate surroundings must bealleviated by comprehensive planning and remedial measures.ii.   Noisy and unattractive public developments must, by betterplanning?be separated from people and their homes.iiie    Damage to visual amenity by large-scale public works mustbe minimised by good pleasing design.* New Roads in Towns.   Report by the Urban Motorways Committeeto the Secretary of State for the Environment published by HMSO price 37p.
ivs    Noise? smell and other forms of pollution must bereduced to a minimum at source - if it is practicable,eliminated,,v.   Where, in spite of these efforts, damage still is done to individual amenities, reasonable compensation must beprovided for those who suffer injury,,vie    The processes of inquiry and decision on projects,compulsory purchase and payment of compensation must bethorough but concentrated in time and must be conducted soas to minimise blight and the hardship this entails0vii. No time must be lost in carrying through the new approach to design and planning, to remedial works and sound insulation,to acquisition and compensation.viiio    People threatened by, or suffering from, the effects ofpublic works must be told, in an understandable way, their rightsand the help which is available to them.86     These principles underlie the proposals set out in this white paper.    First, as the Urban Motorways Committee Report has advocated,there must be a new approach to highway building.    The Government1sproposals are set out in Chapter 2 and will also apply to other sortsof public development besides roads.   Second, a number of improvementsare urgently needed in the land compensation code0    These are described in Chapter 3,   Finally, as set out in Chapter ij., action must be coordinated by all those concerned with protection againstassaults on the senses and with the control of development and withplanning and design.9o     These measures will mean that some kinds of public development will cost more.   Hitherto some of the wider results of development,such as severance of communities and loss of amenity have been paid for by the people whose properties have been adversely affected.In future more of these costs must fall on the community at largethrough the authorities responsible for the development, such ashighway authorities, airport operators, statutory undertakers andthe Government itself, as they provide design solutions which give better protection to the environment, as they carry out remedialworks and as they more fully compensate those whose land they take,
or &quot;whose property is depreciated as a result of their activities.The Government believe it is right that each authority should bearin this way a larger proportion of the costs that are involved in.providing for the needs of the community0
CHAPTER 2   DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS AND REMEDIESRoads and Traffic10.      The biggest day to day environmental problem facing most people in our towns and cities today is that of living with traffic.      Sincethe war and especially over the last 10 years or so, there has been an enormous increase in the number of vehicles, particularly cars, onour roads.      There are at present about 15 million vehicles in use.By the end of the 1970s this figure may well have risen to about22 million.      Increasing car ownership has brought great benefits, interms of convenience and mobility, to many thousands of individuals and their families.     It has also created intolerable noise, vibration,smell, congestion and risks to person and property in the many townsand villages which were not built to deal with such volumes of traffic.11.     The Government&apos;s road programme aims to achieve environmentalimprovements by diverting long distance traffic, and in particularheavy goods vehicles, from a large number of those towns and villagesand especially the historic towns many of which are at present sufferinseverely from the volume of traffic.     But major new roads also are needed to cope with this traffic.     They will confer substantialbenefits not only directly on those who use them but also indirectlyon the whole community, since accessibility affects the price vie pay for a whole range of goods and services.     Within urban areas welldesigned road schemes, as well as fulfilling transport requirements,can also benefit the environment by channelling traffic so as to relieve residential roads and alleviate congestion.12.     In the planning and design of new roads considerable attention is already paid to the conservation of town and countryside, forexample   by the use of derelict land.      But it is inevitable that newroads in towns may have to cross established residential areas,sometimes with attendant disruption to people&apos;s lives.     Not only dothese roads displace people living along the route, but they alsoaffect - sometimes severely - the environment of those living alongsideit by constructional nuisance, visual intrusion, traffic noise,severance of parts of existing communities and interference with access to shops, schools etc and generally by intrusion into the area and
into the surrounding landscape.     Close attention must therefore begiven to the needs and convenience of the householder and thepedestrian as well as the motorist.13,     These have been the central issues which the Urban MotorwaysCommittee have considered and X\which form the subject of their report.The Government welcome this report.      The Committee propose that indecision-making on the line and design of such major new roads the indirect costs and benefits which the road may generate should beconsidered with as much care as is given to the direct costs and benefits.     The Committee also propose that so far as reasonably practicable the environment should be preserved by the selection ofthe line and the design of the road and by remedial works on landadjoining it and that compensatory measures should deal with the adverse effects which cannot be so avoided.     The Government believe this is the right general policy.111.     The Committee&apos;s more detailed recommendations to this end are that highway authorities should have wider powers to acquire land and carry out works and a new duty to pay for sound insulation.      they also recommend new entitlements to compensation.     The Government1sproposals on these specific measures are set out later in this paper.Changes in statutory powers and entitlements are not, however, enough in themselves.     To be effective, these changes need to be fullyreflected in a new approach to individual schemes.     The Committeeemphasises that the design of the road and the necessary treatment ofadjoining areas is a single planning task and should be handled as oneoperation bringing in all the necessary skills and taking account ofthe opinions of those affected.      The Government will adopt this approach for t3?unk roads, including motorways,/ for which they areresponsible.     But most roads in towns are the responsibility of localauthorities, and the Government look to them to adopt and follow through this same approach.     The Government accept that additional expenditure which may be incurred as a result by local highway authorities ongrant-aided schemes, should rank for&apos; grant&apos;;&apos;;;.Othe^Pu^public Works15.     The Urban Motorways Committee Report is concerned solely with
roads.     But there are other types of public works which, desirablethough they may be in the general interest, pose problems for those people who live close to them.      The Government believe that theprinciples of good design and careful planning advocated by the UrbanMotorways Committee in respect of roads apply also to other public .developments.     This is the approach that must be adopted by theauthorities responsible for them.16.     Because a building is functional, it need not be ugly.      the structural environment must blend with the natural environment.Screening may supplement careful initial design.     New reservoirs forexample, should preserve and improve amenity and provide recreational facilities for the communities affected.     An approach of this sort,coupled with the proposed new powers described later in this chapter to buy land and carry out works and planting to improve the environment ofsurrounding areas, must be an important function of those responsiblefor major public developments.17-     The major benefits of the new provisions on compensation and soundinsulation  outlined elsewhere in this paper will be immediately available once legislation is enacted.     But not all the advantages ofthe new planning approach can be gained so quickly.     Some schemes are too far advanced to be substantially modified, although additionalremedial action might be taken.      Others still in preparation will need to be reconsidered.     The Government recognise that in the short termboth the period and the cost of some schemes may be increased byacceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations.     The necessary furtherresearch&quot;into techniques of assessment and evaluation of the effects of schemes in the longer term   is being promoted by the Government.Sound Insulation   Scheme /18.     One of the most disturbing features created by a new road istraffic noise.     This is particularly so where new roads cut throughareas of residential development.     For the reduction of noise levelsthe Urban Motorways Committee place the main emphasis on road design.But the Committee recognise that it may not in all cases prove possibleto achieve tolerable levels by such means.     They recommend that wherethe predicted noise level at the outside of a dwelling increases above a specified level, there should be a right for the householder to
claim and a duty on the highway authority to provide sound insulation.They also recommend that the specified limit should he kept underreview, that legislation should allow for changes in the limit adopted and that discretionary powers should also enable sound insulation tobe provided to reduce noise nuisance during construction.19. The Government believe that this is the right approach.   Authorities7responsible for new road works must meet the cost of the necessarysound insulation.   A new right to the sound insulation of livingroomsand bedrooms will, be provided where dwellings will be subject tonoise rising above prescribed levels as a consequence of the traffic on new roads or on roads where there have been significant alterations in the location, width or level of the carriage way.    The BuildingResearch Establishment are preparing guidance on how to calculatecertain traffic noise levels.    Specifications of the required soundinsulation and ventilation standards are also being compiled;preliminary information about what is proposed is going to localauthorities and others concerned.20,   Sound insulation schemes under existing legislation can alreadybe made in relation to aerodromes.    Schemes around Heathrow, Luton,Manchester and Gatwick are, or will shortly be, in operation.New Powers, of Acquisition and to do-rRemedial J/orks21.   One consequence of a wider environmental approach in planningpublic works will be that it may be necessary to acquire adjoining landin order to carry out a comprehensive treatment.   This will be particularly true of roads, beca^^se of their special &quot;corridor&quot; naturethrusting through the existing fabric.   The Urban Motorways Committeeaccordingly recommended new compulsory and discretionary acquisitionpowers.   The Government intend to provide authorities with compulsory powers to acquire, as an integral part of a road scheme, property whichis needed to mitigate the adverse effect on the environment of theadjacent areas and to enable works to be carried out so as to fit theroad satisfactorily into its surroundings,   A discretionary power forthe highway authority to buy dwellings by agreement where they are
satisfied that there is serious hardship, will be sufficient to dealwith the cases where the highway authority may not need for its purposean individual property whose occupier will nevertheless be very badlyaffected by noise or the case where houses are severely affected bythe noise and disruption of the road construction works and where soundinsulation or temporary rehousing does not provide an adequate solution.These discretionary powers will be available up to one year after start of use.    In the case of other public works, authorities will be givensimilar discretionary powers of acquisition.    In addition, all public authorities will be given powers to carry out works designed to minimise the injurious effect on property or adjacent land and tomaintain or improve the surroundings of the development itself.
CHAPTER 3   COMPULSORY PURCHASE AND COMPENSATION22.   Despite a new emphasis in the planning and acquisition ofland for public works so as to cause the minimum disruption tothose living in the areas concerned and despite remedial workssuch as sound insulation where this is possible, some publicdevelopments will still unavoidably have harmful effects onpeople and their property.   Since taking office the Governmenthave studied comprehensively this problem and the views andrecommendations presented to them on it.   They have consideredblight which arises where public acquisitions are in the offing,the extent to which the present compensation code is adequatewhen property is taken and the injurious affection which can be caused to property by the use of new works..,r INJURIOUS AFFECTION23.   Most development, whether public or private, affects otherproperty in its vicinity, sometimes beneficially and sometimesadversely.   This is one of the normal hazards of propertyownership.   Where the development and its use cause a nuisancethe remedy generally open to those affected is an action atcommon law.   But some homes suffer substantial injuriousaffection from the use of public developments yet those wholive in them have no redress because the offending activity isin the nature of a &quot;legalized nuisance&quot;.   This is particularlytrue when the use is for a road or an aerodrome.   The Governmenthave therefore decided that where certain property is injuriouslyaffected by public developments close by a statutory right to compensation is needed.24.   The proposed new right will apply in respect of the use of roads and aerodromes and any other use where the statutoryauthorisation under which the public development is carried out and used bars an action at common law.   All those with a legalinterest in residential property and all owner-occupiers of farmsand small businesses, provided that they acquired their interestprior to the start of use of the public works, will be eligible
(confidential)to receive compensation for any significant depreciation inthe value of their property where this is caused by such nuisancespermanently in value because a noisy new road now runs by or aircraft from a new aerodrome fly overhead the owner can claim for that loss of value.25.   The compensation will be measured by the depreciation inthe existing use value of the claimant&apos;s interest by referenceto prices current at the valuation date.   The valuation datewill be twelve months after the start of use of the works so asto allow values to stabilize.   It will be assumed in the valuationthat sound insulation, where there is a right under statutory provisions to have it installed, has been carried out.    Compen-sation will not be payable unless the loss in value exceeds  50and a claimant will bear the first  50 of loss.   This will ensurethat compensation is paid for any significant drop in valuewhile it will exclude frivolous claims.26.   These new injurious affection provisions will not applywhere there is simply an increase in the use of the works.The use of existing facilities up to their full potential capacitymust always be expected, including that which may be the consequenceof a road or air traffic management scheme.   However, in connectionwith roads and airports there could be works carried out whichsignificantly affect surrounding amenity but which could not inthe normal run of things have been foreseen by those choosing to live close by.   The new right will therefore apply to the useof significant alteration works as well as to the use of new works.   In the case of roads, the works which may give grounds for compensation will be those which alter the location, widthor level of the carriageway.   This means for example that wherea road is double-decked or a two lane road becomes three, thenew injurious affection scheme will apply to surrounding propertyaffected by the noise and smell.   In the case of existingaerodromes, such works will be the construction of new runwaysand the relocation, extension or strengthening of existingrunways.as noise or smell resulting from the use of the works. Where,for example, a dwelling is depreciated significantly and
(confidential)27.   The period within which claims can be made will be twoyears from the valuation date ie between one and three yearsafter the start of use of the works.   Those who sell during theyear following the start of the use can register a claim beforedisposing of their interest in the property and any compensationfor which they would have been eligible had they remained willbe assessed and paid after the valuation date.28.   The cost of compensation will be met by the authorityresponsible for the works the use of which causes the injuriousaffection.   There will be a right to refer to the Lands Tribunalcases of disputed entitlement both on the eligibility of a claim and on the amount of compensation.29.   It is the Government1s intention that injurious affectioncaused by the use of new public works for defence purposes should come within the scope of these proposals but to providesatisfactorily for this by statute may involve amending theDefence Acts.   Pending any such legislation, the substance ofthe proposals will be put into operation in relation to defenceworks by administrative action.   The Secretary of State for defence will also at his discretion, authorise the soundinsulation of buildings which are subject to high noise levelsthrough the use of new neighbouring defence installations.30.   The preceding paragraphs 25-29 apply where no part of aperson&apos;s property has been taken from him.   In addition, theGovernment also propose   to improve the basis on which compen-sation will be payable for injurious affection where part only of a claimant&apos;s land is taken.   Hitherto a claimant has generallybeen entitled to compensation only for such of the effects ofthe construction and use of the works as take place on the landtaken from him.   In future there will be provision for compen-sation to be based on the depreciating effect of the works andtheir use as a whole upon the land left to him.31.   The Government believe that their proposals for compensation(confidential)
for injurious affection together with the proposals described inparagraph 21 above for the wider acquisition powers and for the related powers to carry out remedial works to fit the roadsatisfactorily into its surroundings should provide a fairerdeal for those whose property is seriously depreciated by new developments such as roads and aerodromes, used for the benefitof the community.32.   Apart from the period 1948 to 1958, when compensation forland acquired by public authorities was based on the principlesfirst of the 1947 Planning Act and then of the 1954 Planning Act,market value has been the basis of the compensation code for public acquisitions for over half a century.   This has in generalbeen accepted as a fair basis and although the Government have considered carefully the arguments put forward for abandoning it,they have concluded that it strikes as equitable a balance as ispossible between public and private interest.    It also provides a firm objective basis of valuation.   The Government thereforereaffirm their intention of retaining market value as the basis for the compensation code,33*   However, there are a number of changes which could be madeto improve the operation of the code in certain cases.   some are of general application.   Others apply to residential, smallbusiness or agricultural interests.    These are described in thefollo wing paragraphs,General34.   One of the problems in the valuation and negotiation ofpublic acquisitions is that the process may take many months.Even taking possession is not necessarily dependent uponsettlement of the amount or payment of compensation.   Althoughinterest is payable from the date when possession is taken, this does little to help a claimant who needs ready money to acquire a similar interest in an alternative property or to meet expenses incurred before dispossession.
(confidential)35.   The Government consider that there should he a right to advance-pajgments of compensation.     Where the acquiring authority have taken possession there is no justification for not making an advance payment if the claimant wants one.    The Bill will therefore &quot;be provided that on or after entry there should be an obligation on the acquiring authority, on request from theclaimant, to pay up to 90$ of the amount of compensation agreedor estimated by the authority, subject to satisfactory evidenceof title and adequate information on which to base an estimate.The acceptance of such a payment will not prejudice the claimantif he wishes to dispute the amount of compensation ultimatelypayable.36.   The Government have decided that it would not be reasonable to make it obligatory upon authorities to pay any compensationbefore entry to the property.   But hardship-may arise even before the owner is dispossessed.   A recommendation will thereforebe made to all acquiring authorities to make advances of up to90$ before entry if the claimant needs the money to reinstatehimself before he can reasonably be expected to give up possession.Residential Interests37.   When people&apos;s homes are acquired for public developments the occupiers who ai*e obliged to uproot themselves suffer personalupset, discomfort and inconvenience. Owners of fit houses will of coursereceive the market value of their interest just as they would ona sale to a private buyer.     Over and above that, they willgenerally be eligible for disturbance payments to meet suchconsequential expenses as removal costs and legal costs ofobtaining alternative property .   Other occupiers are usuallypaid their removal expenses.   The Urban Motorways Committeehave recommended that some extra payment, quite separate fromthat compensation, should be made to those people as a mark of recognition of the special hardship of compulsory dispossessionfrom a home.    Such payments, since they reflect loss of a home -something distinct from the value of the land and the bricks andmortar - would apply to tenants as well as to owner-occupiers.
(confidential)The Government believe that the principle of a lump sum payment ofthis sort, quite independent of the payment for the interest acquired,is right.   They have therefore decided that where an authority wishes to acquire houses, whether for roads or for other public works, throughcompulsory purchase or with the backing of compulsory purchase powers,a home loss -payment equivalent to three times the rateable value(as this will be established when properties are revalued next spring)should be paid to the occupier whether he happens to be the owner ora tenant, provided he has occupied the house as his only or mainresidence for at least seven years before the date on which possessionis taken.   Where however the acquisition by the authority is at theowner1s instigation, as where a blight notice is served, thisentitlement will not apply.    Those eligible will include farmers and small businessmen in respect of the houses they occupy.    The payment will be subject to a maximum of  1500.38.   The Government have given special consideration to ways ofdealing with hard cases that arise when owner-occupiers of lowvalue houses have these compulsorily acquired and cannot buyequivalent accommodation with the compensation received.   The proposals in the following paragraphs are designed to help in these cases.39.   Certain obligations are placed by statute on public authoritiesto rehouse residents who are displaced as a result of the acquisitionof their property for public works.    There is, however, no uniformity in these obligations.   Some displaced residents have to rely on the goodwill of the displacing authority or the housing authority.    TheGovernment have decided that the present variable and partial legal obligations should be repealed.   These obligations will be replaced&quot;by a duty.....to be ^imposed on housing authorities to rehouse anyresidential occupiers displaced by a public body possessing powersof compulsory purchase.   But the housing authority must be satisfiedthat there is no suitable residential accommodation otherwiseavailable on reasonable terms to the person displaced.    New TownCorporations will continue to be responsible for rehousing as they arenow under Section 22 of the New Towns Act, or Section 22 of the HewTowns (Scotland) Act 1968.(otnfidentiai?)
40.   The obligation is to be placed on the housing authority as it is best able to cope with the resultant needs.    Thedisplacing authority, where it is not the. housing authority,will be required to meet any net loss incurred by the housingauthority in meeting the obligation.41.   Sitting tenants of New Town Corporations and (if the owningauthority are willing) of council houses can buy their housesat a substantial discount, and other people may be able to buyvacant council houses on the same terms.   Owner-occupiersdisplaced by public developments may therefore be able to buya council dwelling or may be eligible for a council tenancy.   Asa measure to help those displaced the Government will urge localauthorities to meet their rehousing obligations in appropriate cases by offering council^Jipjises^for^ale on the most beneficialterra a,, ayailable under any consents given by the Secretary ofState pursuant to Section 104 of the Housing Act, 1957. (Section145(6) of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1966 as amended bySchedule 9 of the Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland)Act, 1972).42.   The housing authority will be regarded as having dischargedits obligation to any displaced occupier who does not wish tobecome a council tenant if it makes him a loan to enable him toMj^QS^ieX-JlQiLSS&apos;     Owner-occupiers displaced in these circum-stances are already included in one of the specified categories of borrowers under the arrangements for local authority lendingintroduced by DOB Circular 22/71, Welsh Office Circtilar 58/71and SDD Circular    26/71.&apos;  The Government regard this type ofborrower as having a very high priority for any mortgage financeavailable.43.   The Government will encourage local authorities to makemortgage advances on the most helpful terms possible, as toduration, amount and repayment, to displaced owner-occupiers of low value property.   Local authorities will be given a discretionary power to grant ^interjss^ilLJhls category who might ot?aerwise be unable to purchase
(confidential)satisfactory alternative accommodation.   This * interest-only&apos;mortgage (the kind where interest alone is payable during the life of the loan, and the capital is repaid not by instalmentsbut in full on the eventual termination of the loan), could be especially helpful to the elderly owner-occupier with a limitedincome because the periodic payment under such a mortgage isof course less than under the usual instalment-repayment mortgageinvolving periodic repayment of capital as well as interest.44.   The Supplementary Benefits Commission have indicated thatthey would meet the interest charges on any type of localauthority mortgage entered into by a displaced owner-occupierentitled to supplementary benefit at least to the level of the .&quot;fair rent&quot; for comparable unfurnished accommodation in the locality to which he decides to move.45.   The market value basis of compensation does not apply toa house that is declared to be unfit for human habitation.When it is acquired for demolition, compensation is restricted to the value of the site cleared of buildings.   Most owner-occupiers however are not entitled to a supplement bringing thesum received by them up to market value.    In the case oftenanted houses (and some owner-occupied houses) an unfit house that is being acquired at site value but has been kept in goodrepair, in spite of its inherent unfitness, will attract a&quot;well-maintained&quot; payment.   At present this can be equal to four times the rateable value of the house if it has been whollywell-maintained (7 l/5th times the rateable value in Scotland),or to twice the rateable value if either the,, interior or theexterior only lias been well-maintained.   The apportionment ofthese payments between landlord and tenant is a matter for thelocal authority.   To encoiirage owners of houses which are approaching the end of their lives to keep them in as goodrepair as possible, the Government propose to. increase the amountoft payment for.good maintenance, subject -- as at present - tothe limitation that these payments cannot, together with thesum payable for site value, exceed the market value of the propertyas a house.
46.   It is the practice of a few local authorities to reducethe compensation paid for properties acquired from those owner-occupiers who are rehoused in council houses.   The Government areof the view that the acceptance, of. a council tenancy by adisplaced owner-occupier in housing need should not involvepropose therefore,, to prohibit this practice.,47.   As part of the Government1 s general policy of helping the disabled to live a normal life within the community, they propose that where a dwelling has been substantially modifiedfor a disabled jperson, such a claimant will have the option tohave his compensation assessed upon the basis of the reasonablecost of equivalent reinstatement, subject to the general rules which apply to this form of compensation.48.   Finally, removal expenses^for.those residential occupierswho have no compensatable interest, in land will be made payableas of right..   This means that they will no longer be dependenton the goodwill of acquiring authorities for the payment ofsuch expenses caused by the dispossession.Business Interests49.   The Government have given careful consideration to theneeds of owners of small businesses (that is to say, business premises with a rateable value currently not exceeding  750in England and Wal.es or  1500 in Scotland) and to the views ofthe Bolton Committee of Inquiry on Small Firms (Cmnd 4811).These owners can encounter particular hardship as a result of compulsory acquisition.50,   The Government accept the recommendation of the BoltonCommittee that S59(D of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1954should be repealed to enable the short term tenant&apos;s right to renew his tenancy to be taken into account in assessingcompensation.the-abatemeirt-jof, the. compensation statutorily due to him^and
(confidential)51.   There is a group of unprotected business tenants (egtenants holding over and licensees) who have no statutory rightto compensation following compulsory purchase action.    They shouldnot have to rely on the discretion of the acquiring authorityfor disturbance compensation.   They will therefore be includedin the proposal in paragraph 48 above and for trade loss as wellas removal expenses.52,   Provision will be made for the owner-occupier or tenant ofa small business (or all of them if more than one) who is over 60and decides to give up business following compulsory acquisition,to opt to claim compensation as if his business was extinguishedbecause no other property was available in which it could bere-established.53.   As the Bolton Committee have pointed out, difficulties canarise where the only alternative premises available are largeror more expensive than those ccmpulsorily acquired.    TheGovernment looks to local authorities to bear in mind the needsof small businesses in planning their redevelopment, and to use their existing^ppwers fully to give sympathetic treatment tothose who are being dispossessed.54.   The proposals outlined above, together with the right to claim compensation for injurious affection due to noise and smell,the 90fo advance payment system and the improvements in the blightprovisions proposed in paragraphs 58 - 64 below add up to abetter deal for small businesses affected by compulsory purchase.Where premises are used for both residential and other purposes,both owner-occupiers and tenants will also benefit in respect ofthe residential part of their premises, from sound insulationand the home loss payments-.Agricultural Interests55.   The Government have considered the representations madeon behalf of agricultural interests about the operation of thecompensation code as it applies in their particular circumstances.
A number of the general improvements proposed will be of benefit to agricultural interests, notably the home loss payments, advance payments of compensation, the improvements in the blight provisions and the new proposals for compensation for injurious affection and for soundinsulation.    In addition two measures of particular application toagricultureal interests will be introduced,56.   The first relates to the owner-occupi e r s temno rary loss,of yield,that is to say, the disturbance incurred when a farm undertakinghas to be re-established elsewhere.    Because of the long timescale ofagricultural production, its peculiar dependence on land and the complex effects of climatic and other factors on yield, owner-occupierswho lose the whole of their holdings and have to move to unfamiliarland may be faced with temporary unavoidable losses in yield.   TheGovernment have decided to make provision for additional paymentsequivalent to one year!s net farm income in recognition of these losses.   These will be payable to owner-occupiers who are compensatedon the basis of the agricultural value of their land and who within years of dispossession engage in the farming of other agricultural land in which they previously had no interest.57.   The second relates to the severance of agricultural land.   TheGovernment propose that where agricultural land is taken the ownershall have the right, comparable to that already available for othersorts of land, to require the authority to acquire.the whole of the unit he owns if the remaining land is not reasonably capable of being .farmed as a separate holding on its own or in conjunction with other land farmed as part of the same unit or in his ownership.   This rightwill apply similarly in respect of blight notices.    Tenants will alsobe given a parallel right to require enlargement of notices of entry.These new rights should be particularly helpful in reducing difficultyin cases of severance such as sometimes occur in connection withreservoirs and new roads. *
(confidential)BLIGHT58.   When public development is mooted property falls in valueor even becomes unsaleable if it is known, or believed, thatit will be acquired in the future.   Other property maytemporarily lose value because it is feared that it will loseamenity when the works are built - what is known as 1 blight byproximity&apos;.    The measures taken to implement the Urban MotorwaysCommitteefs Report will help to tackle this problem at sourceby acquiring and dealing with the adjacent properties as partof the treatment of the highway generally.   Blight is a serious problem for those who wish to move house.   Where the cause isimpending acquisition this has been recognised in the statutoryentitlements whereby statutory blight notices may be servedrequiring the development authority to purchase certain types of property in advance of need.   The proposals outlined inparagraphs 23 - 31 will assist where blight by proximity becomesinjurious affection.59.   One of the special difficulties associated with blightis the very long time span over which it can occur, and thelarge areas it can affect when a number of options are knownto be under discussion.   The Government have given theirviews on the   Skeffington Report recommendations and have advised local authorities about how these are to be pursued(DOE Circular 52/72 and Welsh Office Circular 104/72).   Butpublic participation although necessary and desirable is not without its dangers in that it can increase the risk of blight.As long as the options for public development schemes are open for discussion, the threat of compulsory acquisition will hangover all the property that might be affected even though thereis no certainty that any particular scheme will go ahead.   Thisis one of the reasons why the Government have strongly advisedlocal avithorities first to narrow the options discussed tothose that are realistic and second to avoid an excessivelylong drawn out process of selection.* People and Planning.   HMSO 1969
60.   Where it is nevertheless inevitable that a degree of blightis created, and there is a reasonably firm prospect that particularproperty will be required, the Government intend to improve theright to demand that there should be public acquisition inadvance of need,   The advice given... to local authorities&apos; in^MBlGrDevelopment Department^Circular 69/71 will be given legislativeforce.   The Government will create a statutory right for owner-occupiers of houses, small businesses, and agricultural interests to require public authorities to buy their properties in thecircumstances listed in those Circulars (see Appendix A).This will not affect the amount of compensation individualsreceive, but where certain local authorities have been reluctant to use their discretionary powers in advance acquisition, the citizen whose property is blighted will be entitled to demand that earlier relief.61.   Similar property in areas covered by a draft or substantiveNew Town Designation Order will be brought into the scheme.Although development corporations give sympathetic considerationto requests for advance purchase, this is not enough.    Owner-occupiers in the categories described in paragraph 60 within such areas will now have a right to serve statutory blightnotices from the first formal stage in the establishment of anew town.   As a counterpart to this Section 11 of .the^ewJPjpwnsAct, 1965 - which gives any owner of land in a new town designatedarea the right to require the development corporation to acquireit at any time from seven years after the designation order -will be repealed.62.   There is a further category of people who have sufferedserious problems without any remedy being available to them under the blight provisions.    These are owner-occupiers of&amp;3^g.r.tiy. in clearance...areas declared under Part III of theSSHS^S^^J^I (3-n Scotland, owner-occupiers of property tobe demolished in a housing treatment area declared for clearanceunder Housing (Scotland) Act, 1969). In future they will beentitled to require the local authority to buy their houses and will not have to wait - often for lengthyCircular 46/70 (Welsh Off igiL-Circular 48/70)-and Scottish
(confidential)periods - for a compulsory purchase order to be made and confirmed.63.   The Government propose to make a minor change in thepresent blight rules so that personal representatives ofdeceased persons may qualify to serve blight notices.64.   The Government also propose to drop the requirement which makes it necessary for an owner who has tried unsuccessfully tosell on the^qpen market before his property comes within thestatutory blight category to try again after that event.65.   Finally, where there are changes in acquisition rightsthere will be the necessary corresponding extensions in blightentitlements.   For example, blight notices will be capable of taking into account the wider powers of compulsory landacquisition proposed for highways, or the right of agriculturaloccupiers to require enlargement of notice to treat where theremaining land Is not capable of being farmed as a separateholding or in conjunction with other land.
CHAPTER k   PRIORITIES FOR ACTION AND SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS66.   The Government&apos;s proposals are designed to strike a new balance between development to serve the community as a whole and themitigation of any adverse effects on the individual citizen.    Someof them will be achieved by administrative action, but others require legislation.    The Government therefore intend to introduce a bill as soon as possible in order to provide the necessary powers and obligations.   Any uncertainty that the announcement of the Government&apos;intentions to enact the necessary legislation might bring to theland market must be minimised.   At the same time as man;/ people aspossible should be eligible for the improved entitlements.    Theprovisions of the Bill as to compensation for acquisition will therefore apply to all transactions where possession is taken and compensation is agreed or determined on or after the date of this white Paper.    No settlements need meanwhile be held, up on this account.    Claims can be made and interim agreements be reached on thebasis of existing law; when the new compensation rights are enacted,any additional compensation payable will then be settled.67.    In the case of the injurious affection scheme, however, since this new statutory right will involve a claim period extending to three years after start of use, the Government have decided thatclaims may be made in respect of developments coming into use within three years before the date of this White Paper as well as thosecoming into use thereafter.    Injurious affection compensation may therefore be payable in respect of all dwellings seriously affectedby public works coming into use on or after p.% October 19697-    Thiswill mean that many of the hard cases that have arisen while theUMC completed their work and the Government reviewed the x-jhole landcompensation code will qualify for compensation.    Claims will be eligible following enactment of the necessary legislation.   Whereland for such schemes has been acquired and compensation for theeffects of the part of the works on the land taken has already been paid, it wall be open to those owning the land affected to make a claim for any additional injurious affection compensation which thenew scheme will offer them.68.   Running with this proposed entitlement to injurious affectioncompensation, powers will be provided to enable authorities, attheir discretion,to jjQJ^n dm--in peninsula^ t e mc g^t a in ^r opsr t i e s affected by.
(confidential)schemes coming into use from /1g October 1-9697 onwards.    TheGovernment intends that the statutory right to sound insulationdescribed in paragraph 19 should be available in respect of schemescoming into use from the date of this White Paper onwards.69.   Where Government Departments already have the necessarydiscretionary powers these will be used to give effect to the government&apos;s proposals.    Local authorities and other public bodies are being asked to make similar use of existing powers, particularlyin respect of rehousing, disturbance payments, advance payments ofcompensation, and blight acquisitions.    Other circulars of guidancewill flow from the positive planning principle outlined at thebeginning of this White Paper.    It is essential that there shouldbe early and universal recognition of the importance of separatingpeople and their homes from noisy and unattractive developments;where this is not possible, the design must minimise the harm.70.    It wTill be important that those entitled to the new rightsshould know all about them.    The problems and fears of many of those whose property lies in the path of, or close to, public works stemfrom uncertainty and lack of knowledge of their rights to compensation and of the help available to them in connection with this and thebusiness of finding a new home.    It would help many of them .to have more information about the processes of public development and howthose affected may have their properties acquired or sound insulated,receive compensation and get help with rehousing.    The Government will issue notes of guidance a.s soon as the new provisions are enacted.Public authorities will be asked to make these widely available toall those affected by their proposals and to consider meanwhile how this information may be supplemented through personal contacts,forexample in housing advisory centres, nominated liaison officers,citizens advice bureaux etc.1 . A better balance must be achieved in public development betweenprovision for the community as a whole and the mitigation of any2. This means a new approach to planning public projects, basedon eight principles (Para 7).71 .    SUMMARY OP CONCLUSIONSadverse effects on the individual citizen (para 5).
3.    The Government endorse the general policy on major road construction recommended by the Urban Motorways Committee.A new approach to the design and treatment of roads is needed andwill be adopted by the Government for trunk roads including motorways.They look to local authorities to follow through the same approach,and additional expenditure to this end on grant-aided schemes willrank for grant.    (paras 13 and II4.)Ij..   A similar approach should be adopted by those responsible forother types of public works  (para 15).5*   Powers will be provided with respect to sound insulation of dwellings where new roads and certain other highway works areexcessively noisy, the full cost to be met by.-public authorities responsible, (para 19-20)6.   Highway authorities will have wider powers of compulsory purchaseto enable them to plan roads more comprehensively within theirsurroundings.    Discretionary powers will be made available to public authorities to acquire other property severely affected during theconstruction of works, or when they come into use, and to carry outremedial works. (Para 21)7.   A new right to compensation will be provided for certain categories of people from&apos;whom no land is taken and who have no rights at common law when their property is injuriously affected by the use of publicworks.    In practice this will mainly mean the use of roads and aerodromes (paras 23-29).8.   The basis of compensation for injurious affection where part ofa property is taken will be improved (para 30).9.   Market value will continue to be the basis of the compensationcede (para 32).10.   An obligation will be imposed on acquiring authorities to make90$ advance payments of compensation on or after entry and  they willbe asked to consider sympathetically requests for advance paymentbefore entry where the claimant needs this to reinstate himself (para 35).
(confidential)11.    A home loss payment independent of the interest acquired will bemade to householders displaced by compulsory acquisition (para 37).12.   A duty will be placed on housing authorities to rehouse anyresidential occupiers displaced by a public authority where there isno suitable other accommodation available.    The displacing authority will meet the- cost (para 39).13.   Local authorities will be urged to offer council houses for purchase on beneficial terms to those x-zhom they have a duty to rehouse(para I4.I ).11)..  Local authorities will be urged to give high priority for mortgagefinance to displaced owner-occupiers of low value property and a newpower will be provided to enable local authorities to offer &quot;interestonly&quot; mortgages (paras 42-43).15.   Well maintained payments will be increased (para l[-5).16.   There will be statutory prohibition against abatement ofcompensation where an owner-occupier is rehoused in a council house(para [j.6).17.   Where a dwelling has been substantially modified for a disabledperson, claimants will have the option of having compensation basedon the reasonable cost of equivalent reinstatement (para Lj.7) -13.   Statutory entitlement to expenses in removing x^rill be providedfor residential occupiers who have no compensatable interest in land and for unprotected business tenants (paras J48 and 51 )19.   S39(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 195^ will be repealed(para 50). /20.   Elderly owner-occupiers and tenants of small businesses villlbe able to opt to claim compensation on extinguishment of businessterms (para 52).21 .   Local authorities in planning redevelopment x*rill be encouraged to bear in mind the needs of small businesses and to give sympathetictreatment to those dispossessed (para 53).
22. Dispossessed owner-occupiers of agricultural holdings who move to a new farm will be entitled to additional payments to recompensefor the special difficulties incurred in undertaking the farming ofunfamiliar land (para 56).23.    Owner-occupiers and tenants who lose part of their agricultural holdings will be entitled to require acquisition of the whole if theremainder is not  capable of being fanned as a separate holding or inconjunction with other land, (para 57)2br.    Statutory backing will be given to the blight categoriesrecommended in MHLG Circular I4.6/7O (para 60).2p. The circumstances in which acquisition may be required will beextended to cover draft designation orders for New Towns (para 61).26.    Declaration of clearance areas under Part III of the housing act 1957 will be grounds for a blight notice (para 62).27.    Personal representatives of deceased persons will be enabled toserve blight notices (para 63).28.    It i^ill no longer be necessary for an owner who has triedunsuccessfully to sell before his property comes within the statutoryblight category to try again after that event (para 61].).2C, .   A Bill will be introduced as soon as possible to provide thenecessary powers and obligations.    This will provide for   the new.acquisition terms and powers   to apply as from the date of theWhite Paper, (para 66). -30.    A new right to injurious affection compensation will be createdwith eligibility in respect of all schemes coming into use on or after /18 October 19697 and authorities wall be given discretionarypowers to provide sound insulation in respect/of such schemes.The statutory entitlement to sound insulation for highway noise will apply to schemes coming into use from the date of the White Paperonwards  (paras 67-68).31 .    Government Departments with the necessary discretionary powers will meanwhile give effect to the Government&apos;s proposals on rehousing,disturbance payments, advance payments of compensation and blightacquisitions and other authorities will be urged to act similarly(para 69).
(confidential)32.   More information needs to be directly available to those affectedby public developments and the Government will prepare notes of guidance for use by public authorities as part of an improved liaisonservice with those concerned (para 70).
