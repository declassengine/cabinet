WHITEHALL REDEVELOPMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department. The Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment (RE) has been considering the redevelopment of Whitehall.2. When plans were published to put up a new building on the areanow occupied (in part) by Richmond Terrace and the Norman ShawNorth building formerly used by the Metropolitan police, there was sucha public outcry that our predecessors set up a public enquiry under mr Harold Willis, QC, to examine the proposals.3. Mr Willis&apos;s report was submitted soon after we came into office.It recommended the preservation of both the Norman Shaw North building and the facade of Richmond Terrace.    We have hitherto reached noconclusion on it.    It had serious implications for Government accommoda-tion, since it would substantially cut the original plans for 4, 000 places;it involved considerable expenditure;  and there was uncertainty aboutthe Parliamentary building on the immediately adjacent site.    But we ought not to delay for much longer.4. The future of the Old Public Offices on the other side of Whitehallis also a matter of concern.    Much of the accommodation is in poorcondition;  but at the same time there is a strong body of public opinion in favour of preserving the building.5. Two of the three buildings are listed Grade 1, and the third(Richmond Terrace) is Grade 2*, i. e. a particularly important Grade %building.    RE came to the view that, in principle, all three should be preserved.    It would remove credibility from our efforts to preserveGrade 1 buildings elsewhere if it were seen that the Government were themselves prepared to demolish them where it suited their convenience.The Committee therefore concluded that plans for the future developmentof Whitehall must be based on the preservation of Richmond Terrace, theNorman Shaw North building and the external facades of the Old public offices (without at this stage entering into any commitment about therestructuring of the accommodation behind these facades).1CP(72) 120 COPY NOp o13 November 1972CABINET
6. The extra cost of preserving these buildings would not be small.The estimates vary according to the assumptions made about how many people will be kept out of Whitehall, where they will have to go, and theuse which is made of any buildings which are preserved.    The estimatedcost, discounted to present value, of erecting two completely new buildings accommodating 8, 000 staff on the Richmond Terrace/NormanShaw North and Old Public Offices sites is  21 million.    The extracosts, on the assumption that these three buildings are preserved, havebeen estimated by officials as  8 million,  23 million or  38 millionaccording to whether staffs which would have been housed in the newWhitehall buildings were accommodated on the London periphery, on a south Bank site or on another Whitehall site.    Account has to be taken of the additional cost, estimated at  2 million, of developing NormanShaw North as a police station to replace Cannon Row.    There must beuncertainty about the estimated cost of preserving Richmond Terracewhich is in a poor state.7. RE have put in hand an examination of all the implications oftheir proposal, including the future accommodation of GovernmentDepartments in relation to the space likely to be available if the threegraded buildings are preserved.8. In view of the importance of the area, the public interest inproposals for its re-development, and the likelihood of some delaywhile the further studies are carried out, the Committee felt that on balance it would be right to announce as soon as possible a decision in principle to preserve the three buildings.    The Cabinet will wish toconsider this conclusion,R home Office13 November 19722
