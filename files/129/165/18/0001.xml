A FLEETING VISIT TO PEKINGNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs. It may interest my colleagues to have the attached account of a fewimpressions, quickly gathered and therefore rather ill-assorted, of the peking of today.2. I will report orally to the Cabinet on the Chinese attitude to hong Kong.A D-foreign and Commonwealth Office6 November 1972CP(72) 118 COPY NO      u 16 November 1972CABINET
ANNEXA FLEETING VISIT TO PEKINGOne is struck at once by the primitive natureof the Chinese life.   The pace is that of the donkey,horse and bicycle.   There are none of the amenities of life of the West.   We visited the house of theleading member of an agricultural commune of 75i000people.   His house consisted of two rooms totallybare of furniture with the communal bed of flat stoneheated underneath by the effluent from the cooking ovennext door.    The only ornament was the inevitablepicture of Chairman Mao.   Several times I saw as many as 50 people working with a kind of hoe breaking the top of the earth, concentrated on about a quarterof an acre.    There is virtually no mechanisation.The cows, pigs and horses seemed to be well cared for.There was little sign of malnutrition.    I would thinkthat the revolution has increased output per acre over thewhole country considerably and that, as a result, there is sufficient food for the people provided that they are notovertaken by some natural calamity.   To that extent theNew China is an improvement on the old.China is clearly a &quot;do it yourself&quot; society.   Time and again I was told that they were determined not to bebeholden to any outsider.   They were conscious that thiswould slow down progress but accepted this handicap.   in keeping with this principle they turned down finance bycredit.   They would rather pay their way gradually and pay in cash.    That is what in fact they are doing forConcorde and the Trident.   They conceded that there might beoccasions when they would have to arrange payment by instalmentbut this was emphatically the exception and not the rule.Expansion of trade with China will therefore be slow.It is also a &quot;do as you are told&quot; society.    Discipline iseverywhere and critical questioning of decrees handed down from the top virtually non-existent.   But there is nevertheless the feel of a working democracy and the leader-ship seems to get the message from the grass roots.    It comesup through a series of revolutionary committees operating at various levels and seems to be heeded.    The operations of the few at the top and particularly of Chairman Mao are wrappedin mystery but the placards and the press spread the news ofwhat is required and it is done.   Obedience or self-disciplineor fear - it is difficult to say.    The people seemed to befriendly but passive.- 1 -
I can confirm the impression of many who havelately been to China that they are obsessed by fear ofRussia&apos;s intentions.   Why, they ask, are there 1 milliontroops on the Soviet-Chinese border?     This colours theirattitude to everything.   They approve of an expanded european community and of the American nuclear umbrellas over europe and Japan.    They even told me that they had advised thecountries of the Middle East not to nationalise Western oil.This fixation concerning Russian intentions is reinforced byan ideological difference over principle 3 of the five principles of peaceful co-existence.    The Chinese say that,while it is admissible to support with propaganda a minoritymovement with whom they have sympathy, it is not permitted to threaten force against a country with which there arediplomatic relations.    I pressed them on when intervention was allowed or disallowed and touched them slightly on the raw over their policy of supporting Somalia against Kenya.I was not convinced by their defence.    But they were insistentthat this deviation by Russia from pure Communist doctrine wasa fundamental cause of their breach of relations.They seemed to be very ready to turn over a new leafwith us and to increase contacts and trade within the limits which their economic rules place upon them.     It was rather a relief after the niceties of Western diplomacy to agreeor disagree with few grey areas.    They were very friendly andeverything was most efficiently run.There is a lot of doubt about the future leadership.Mao Tse-tung is 79 and Chou En-lai 74- and, I would guess,feeling his age.     There is no-one, so far as we coulddiscover, who is marked out for the succession.   When askedabout this Chou En-lai says that there are 1,000 who wouldbe well-equipped to lead.    I would think that in fact theyare very short indeed of top quality people both at thepolitical and official level.They are gradually gaining confidence in their new international role and the Minister of Trade is to come toLondon in January; and I hope the Foreign Minister will pluckup sufficient courage to come in the summer.   We shouldcultivate exchanges at all levels.-2-
