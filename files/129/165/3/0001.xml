THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 103 COPY NO      gg6 October 1972CABINETAGRICULTURAL MARKETING AND HORTICULTURALMARKETING:  DRAFT GREEN paper note by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food. I attach for the information of my colleagues the draft of aGreen Paper which has been agreed by the Ministers principally concerned.2. The adoption of the common agricultural policy and thegreater competition within the enlarged Community are likely to bringabout some changes in agricultural and horticultural marketing.    Theindustry has been expressing some concern and uncertainty about this.Although the Green Paper deals mainly with first-stage marketing by farmers and growers, better marketing at this stage can help toreduce the total cost of marketing and distributing food and to providethe consumer with better value for money.    The Paper sets out the issues as a basis for discussion  with interested bodies during theautumn.3. I propose to publish the Green Paper on Monday 9 October.J ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food6 October 1972

AGRICULTURAL AND HORTICULTURALMARKETINGINTRODUCTORY note. This Green Paper is a consultative document. It is published at thesame time as the report of the Committee of Inquiry on Contract Farming(Cmnd. 5099). This will give Members of Parliament, the industry andpublic a chance of considering these issues in the wider context of marketing.2. The Government accepts the Committee&apos;s judgment of contractfarming and that producer groups and second-tier groups need developing.The Green Paper suggests marketing objectives. It proposes how theymight be achieved. It sets out the action which may be needed to encouragegood marketing developments.   It invites views on organisation.3. Consultations will be held with the principal trade associations and bodies concerned. Any written comments should be sent to MarketingPolicy Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Whitehall Place(West), London, S.W.1, by 31 December, 1972.m134376 a 2
I.   BACKGROUND: THE PATTERN OF CHANGE1. Marketing matters to you. If you are a farmer or grower, it candetermine your income and how much you sell. If you are a merchant,trader, processor, manufacturer or retailer, your business may depend on it. We are all consumers, and it affects the cost, choice and quality of whatwc eat. It will certainly be even more important when the United kingdom is a member of the European Community.2. Farmers in Britain are second to none in producing the goods, andthe industry is now in a confident mood. Output, especially of livestock,is increasing. The Government has also played its part. It has madeavailable the resources to sustain expansion. British agriculture andhorticulture have the technical skills and the confidence to take advantageof the opportunities for higher output in the enlarged Community. But a production policy is only half a policy if it is not wedded to effective useof resources in marketing.3. Marketing is important all the way from the farm gate to the shop.This Green Paper deals mainly with the first stage of food marketing, whenfarmers or growers dispose of their produced It therefore concernsproducers and the first buyers of their goods. But better marketing whichcombines co-operation at the first stage with vigorous competition at the later stages can also give other benefits. It can help to reduce the totalcost of processing and distribution and to hold down prices in the shops.It can improve the range, quality and presentation of goods and give thehousewife a better chance of finding what she wants.4. This Green Paper sets out the Government^ ideas on the ways inwhich marketing might be developed. It complements the report of theCommittee of Inquiry on Contract Farming and puts it in a wider context.The industry will now need to decide what it thinks about these questions and what it ought to do.5. There are many reasons why those concerned with agricultural and horticultural marketing should be taking stock and thinking about thefuture. Two are particularly important. First, the system of agricultural support and the trading circumstances will be quite different when the UnitedKingdom is in the European Community. Now there are commodityguarantees, and the United Kingdom is a national market. But for productscovered by the common agricultural policy there will be no longer a nationalbut a Community market. The common policy sets no support prices or a low level of support price for some products: producers must rely on theirreturns in a highly competitive situation. For other products there will betarget or guide prices supported by intervention. But it will not be infarmers&apos; long-term interest to produce goods only for sale to the intervention Board.  They should aim to get a good return from the market.6. Secondly, big changes are already taking place in the food market.First-stage marketing needs to keep pace with them. Farms are becomingbigger and the enterprises more specialised.    Food  manufacture and* Agricultural and horticultural produce which is not for food or industrial use may bedifferently marketed but some of the arguments in this paper apply to it also,
distribution is being concentrated into fewer hands. The pattern of consumption is changing, particularly in favour of foods which areconveniently prepared.7. Year by year the housewife can see in the High Street and on thelabel the evidence of concentration in food manufacture and retailing. many small firms will continue to thrive through specialisation and good service.But those engaged in first-stage marketing have to deal with fewer tradebuying points.* Grading is being adopted more widely. Better methods ofspecifying and describing products of different qualities are being worked out.8. The buyers of farm produce are becoming fewer. They will alsobe more selective. They will look more and more for goods in bulk or ofa kind suitable for specialised handling or processing. Penny lots orunreliable quality will not satisfy them. The farmer or grower who wants to supply these outlets will have to meet tight specifications. Getting rid of goods which do not match the demand, either by reducing the price orby finding an alternative market, will be more difficult than it is now. Butnot only the farmer will be at risk if the produce is not up to the specification. Some manufacturers and distributors will have a big invest-ment in specialised equipment or labour. They will be dependent on an assured supply of their raw materials.9. These changes could result either in more vertical integration, bywhich the buyer ensures control of his source of supply, or in more directselling under some form of contract. Fewer buyers will be able to acceptthe risk that in the open market or in spot transactions they will not getwhat they need.10. If a processor decides to set up a fully integrated farming andprocessing business, he directly controls the farming operations. In some circumstances this makes good sense. But those who represent farminginterests in many countries have been alarmed that there might be a very rapid increase in vertical integration. This is not probable. The type ofland, the control of disease, the best use of labour and other factorsdetermine how a farm can be most efficiently run. Many farmingbusinesses must combine different enterprises. They do not therefore fitvery easily into a single vertically integrated business.11. First-stage marketing seems bound to develop through moreplanned buying and selling by two separate parties. The relationship between the two parties is at the heart of good marketing in the future. Theywill remain independent.  They will become more and more interdependent.II.   OBJECTIVES12. The consumer is dictating these changes. Marketing objectives must make sense in the changing circumstances. The Government now sees three main objectives for the industry.   First, buyers should be able to obtain,* It was estimated by the Nielsen Researcher Vol. 12, No. 2 of March/April 1971(A.C. Nielsen Company Limited) that only 647 trade buying points covered about 80per cent of the grocery business in Great Britain in 1970 and that the number ofthose buying points (co-operative societies, head offices of multiples and wholesalersserving independent grocers) fell by about 13 per cent in a year.
wherever possible, a continuing supply of goods of the type and qualityrequired. Our marketing arrangements now are well designed to dispose ofeverything available at a particular time at prices which the market will thenbear. But more and more goods will be bought and sold in quantities andqualities planned in advance. Production on a farm or holding cannot always be controlled in this exact way. A crop of potatoes does not contain only those big enough for baking or those round enough for canning or thoselong enough for chips: and the crop will vary in size and in compositionaccording to the weather. The challenge for marketing now is to matchvarying output with increasingly planned buying.13. Secondly, there must be a reliable method of letting the producerknow what the buyer wants. Contract farming is a valuable way of doing this. The Committee has made some specific recommendations for the bestdevelopment of this method of marketing. It favours the more simplemarketing contracts rather than those which transfer some of the producersnormal management responsibilities into the hands of the buyer. It supportscontracts based on tonnage rather than on acreage. Subject to this, it reportsvery favourably on contract farming. It concludes that, through avoidance of waste and more orderly marketing, contract farming improves the service to the consumer and is virtually the only marketing system which is gearedto meeting exacting quality requirements.14. Thirdly, there should be a fair balance between buyers and sellers.This is not only a question of the size of the business enterprises. If contractfarming is to go ahead, both parties to a contract must have the necessary financial, technical and marketing knowledge. The aim is to have for theperiod of the contract a reliable supply of a product of reliable quality. a contract which does not work in practice is a marketing failure.III.  PRODUCER GROUPS, MARKETING UNDER contract and JOINT VENTURES15. The industry will need to decide how far existing arrangements willmeet these objectives. Between the farm gate and the consumer there will always be different marketing problems for the individual products. Thepractical problems of handling and processing are set by the product itself.Animals have to be slaughtered. Meat may have to be chilled, milk heat-treated, grain milled, vegetables cleaned or fruit stored. But there is a singledifficulty at the first stage of marketing for almost all farm products. Theoutput of one farmer or grower will be less and less sufficient to meet thedemands of buyers for bulk supply of specified quality. Better arrangements will be needed in order to bring together the goods. Many farmers andgrowers have already recognised this. Marketing boards, co-operativeassociations and other producer groups do this job.16. The existing marketing structures, such as livestock auctions orwholesale horticultural markets, will continue where the need is shown.But more producers will now be grouping together in order to sell theirproduce. Different views are held on the best way to achieve this. In thenew marketing circumstances of an enlarged Community the arguments forand against compulsory or voluntary participation in producer groups shouldbe examined again.
17. The agricultural marketing legislation of the 1930s was aimed atregulating the supply of produce on the domestic market. Where necessary, .there could be a measure of import control in the producers interest. Inpractice, the marketing boards have generally developed their commercialmarkets on similar lines to other large producer organisations in many countries. Milk marketing, for example, reflects the premium for milk forconsumption and the high cost of transporting liquid milk. practical considerations of this kind will ensure that the present broad pattern of milk marketing makes sense in the enlarged Community.18. For those commodities* which are handled by boards, the marketing system is now solidly based on their work. They have the skillsand the organisation. They have done a first-class job in creating and maintaining arrangements which generally command the support of the producers and their customers. These boards and their essential functionsshould continue.19. For other commodities there are now three new factors to beconsidered. First, within the enlarged Community it will not be practicable to regulate on a national basis the total supply of products covered by thecommon agricultural policy. Producers should look not for control ofnational supply but for quick and effective improvement in first-stagemarketing. Secondly, an important motive force behind the original concept of marketing boards was that a producers&apos; organisation should buy everything that individual farmers produced. This was intended to secure some outletin very hard times. But this is not the issue now. The question now is howfarmers and growers can best produce and bring together for sale the goods ofparticular qualities or grades. Thirdly, over many years producers throughco-operative associations, merchants and other traders have already developed a structure of commercial marketing for the products which are not nowhandled by marketing boards.20. In order to achieve a consistent output and to meet the marketingaims through grouping, farmers or growers must be both able and willing toproduce what is wanted on their individual farms. This points towardsvoluntary grouping on a selective basis. Competition is increasing. early action will improve marketing. The industry should direct its efforts to improving and expanding producer groups where marketing boards do not already exist.21. These groups, if they are properly financed and managed, now appearto offer important advantages in efficient marketing. They can feed backmarket information, so that it influences decisions on production and bringsforward what the customer wants. They can purchase the knowledge of marketing and management which individual members do not have. Theycan put farmers or growers, who could not supply a contract on their own,in a position to assure a continuous supply of the right product. They cancompete more effectively against or work better with big groups or largesellers in other member states. They are likely to be able to financeinvestment in new developments.* That is, milk, hops and wool and, in Northern Ireland, pigs and seed potatoes. the potato Marketing Board does not market the whole crop; the guarantee and marketing arrangements for potatoes are being separately reviewed (Cmnd. 4928, paragraph 12).
22. Producer groups play a large part in marketing in many countries.In the present European Community they have substantial shares of themarket for many products.* There has been a good deal of debate thereabout the forms of group which can best meet modern marketing needs.Some groups, such as the Societes dTnteret Collectif Agricole (SICA) inFrance, cover wider interests than those of producers only. In Britainproducer groups have developed more slowly. There are some large producerco-operative associations, including those which supply goods to farmers aswell as market their produce. But only about 9 per cent of sales off farmsand holdings are through co-operative associations.23. There are also very few &quot; second-tier &quot; marketing groups in Britain.Producer groups do not improve marketing only by gradually gaining more members. They do it more effectively by linking together. A second-tiergroup will market supplies and undertake new developments for its membergroups. This makes the whole structure more flexible; for example, aspecialist grain production group of a multi-purpose co-operative societycould be linked to a grain marketing organisation at the second tier.Generally a production group works best if it is not too large. But amarketing organisation can often benefit from size. Second-tier groups canachieve economies of scale. They can cut costs. They can do a bettermarketing job than the smaller production groups themselves. TheCommittee has emphasised that, if contract farming is to develop well,second-tier groups are needed.24. Second-tier groups have a role to play if they are efficient. the groups will be competing in the market place between themselves and withmerchants and others. This competition will improve the service to theconsumer. It is also the long-term guarantee of the health of the groupsthemselves.25. The potential marketing advantages will only be realised if producergroups are well managed and know how to sell their goods. By simplycreating a group producers do not themselves become marketing experts or* The estimated percentage of output marketed by producer co-operatives is:	West						UnitedPercentage	Germany	Belgium	Fiance	Italy	Luxembourg	Netherlands	KingdomCereals	45	20	82	15	70	55	14Milk	83	50	52	29	91	84	-(&apos;)Meat	25	5(2)	10		26	20	-(3)Fruit	22	60	25	10(4)	100	95	11Vegetables...	32	40	20	15		99	10Potatoes   ...	22		15	32	50	14	6Eggs	20	2				21	21Poultry		4	25			20	1(l) Sold through marketing schemes.(2) Pork.(3) An estimated 12 per cent of livestock.(4) Fruit and vegetables.The estimates for the member states of the present European Community were givenby Dr. Herlitzka of COGECA (Comite General de la Cooperation Agricole des Paysde la Communaute) in an address at a colloquium arranged by the British institute of International and Comparative Law held on 2 April, 1971.
find willing buyers for everything they have to sell. They need someone whoknows the market. For many commodities traders, auctioneers and merchantshave this experience. The industry has to find a good relationship betweenproducer groups and these established interests.26. Some groups will continue to sell their goods through auctions orwholesale markets or to merchants, as many individual farmers or growersdo. A livestock group, for example, may do best for its members by batchinguniform stock for sale through an auction. But groups and merchants maylink in new ways. A merchant may act as manager on a fee-paid basis. a group may contract to use a merchanfs services for all or part of the output.It may undertake a joint venture, such as a packing station, with a merchantor other trading or manufacturing interest.27. There will certainly be more joint ventures. This trend is already very clear in the United States. About a quarter of fruit processed there isnow in enterprises of this kind. In Britain more contract farming will makeproducers and processors collaborate more closely. Joint ventures, which areplanned and run commercially, can make a useful contribution towardsachieving the marketing objectives.28. To sum up, the pattern of marketing should develop on these lines.First, farmers and growers will know better through producer groups whatthe market wants. This will help to bring forward the goods in the bulkand of the quality to satisfy the expanding outlets. Secondly, second-tiergroups the marketing co-operatives or companies of the future will befurther developed. They will achieve economies of scale in marketing. Theywill meet the buyers&apos; needs whilst safeguarding the producers&apos; interest.Thirdly, more produce will be grown and sold on contract. This holds outthe promise of real benefits for the consumer. Marketing costs can bereduced. Quality can be improved. Finally, closer links will be formedbetween producers and merchants, processors, manufacturers and retailers.Joint ventures are one way of making this link, and these will increase.IV.  ACTION TO ENCOURAGE THESE DEVELOPMENTS29. These developments are all in the industry&apos;s own interest. TheGovernment has examined how they might be encouraged. The issues are possible legal or financial obstacles, equity investment, commercial servicesand Government and Community (FEOGA) finance.30. In paragraphs 150-152 of its report the Committee of Inquiry onContract Farming sets out reasons why co-operatives have not gone aheadas strongly here as in some other countries in Europe. If farmers or growerswant to form a group for co-operative marketing, they might normally do sounder the Industrial and Provident Societies legislation. If there are any difficulties in this legislation for the effective future development of genuinelyco-operative societies, clearly these should now be looked at.31. The Government will introduce legislation as soon as time permitsto raise the maximum shareholding (now  1,000) in a co-operative societyregistered under the Industrial and Provident Societies legislation. There arefour other questions under consideration.   First, should co-operatives be
able to obtain more capital from non-producers? This might have to beon preferred terms, since control would rest with the producer members.&apos; Secondly, should producers be encouraged to subscribe capital toco-operatives through funds financed from currently distributed surpluses?Thirdly, are changes needed in order to help co-operatives to invest in jointventures with companies or other organisations? Fourthly, is there adequate provision for the operations of producer groups under the agriculturallegislation giving certain exemptions from the restrictive trade practices law?32. Those who become members of co-operative societies are entitledto expect that the arrangements should genuinely maintain the co-operativenature of the enterprise. But the Government accepts in principle that bothmarketing co-operatives and companies should be able to participate fully in the continuing development of contract farming and joint ventures.33. The Committee has also argued that there is an overriding need forrisk capital in marketing; that producer groups and similar ventures have suffered in the past from too little equity investment; and that this will affectthem even more in the future. Farmers can usually provide collateralsecurity for loan capital for their farming activities. This may not be so forgrouped enterprises. Farmers may have enough resources to cover the riskelement in the business of a producer group. The group itself, however,may not have sufficient resources to support activity at the second tier.34. Risk capital will always be invested where the owner thinks thatrewards are likely to be greatest. But producer groups must be bestorganised to attract the resources necessary to support development at thesecond tier. The Committee has forecast that, if production and marketingare well organised and co-ordinated, farming should offer investors as gooda return as other commercial sectors. If so, this sort of worthwhileinvestment should not be held back.35. Improved marketing needs not only finance but supporting services.Most of these services are of a commercial kind. Those who gain willmeet the cost. The scale and type of service will therefore depend on whatthey are prepared to pay. The Committee has stressed that producer groups,joint ventures and the industry as a whole can benefit from good supporting services in four areas better management, market intelligence, procurementand possibly arbitration on contracts. If the demand is there and commercialbenefits can be expected, the industry will want to consider whether these services should be developed.36. There is also a national interest in management and marketintelligence. Co-operative associations are eligible under present legislation for grants which can improve their management, and the importance of management in co-operative projects has been widely recognised. Marketintelligence is expected to play a more important role in the tradingcircumstances of an enlarged Community. It can improve the matching ofsupply and demand in the bigger market.37. Financial aid is already being given to producer co-operativeassociations for a wide range of improvements in marketing. On therecommendation of the Central Council for Agricultural and HorticulturalCo-operation, there are grants for investment in buildings and some
equipment. Aid is available for marketing feasibility studies and forformation costs. Key management can be aided, normally for three years,and there are grants towards management selection and training.38. These grants should continue. The Government would also beready to consider whether this money should be redirected in order to achieve the marketing objectives better.39. The European Economic Community has given certain functions and advantages to producer groups. Under certain circumstances theiragreements can be exempted from the Community&apos;s rules of competition.Producer organisations for fruit and vegetables and for hops already havea role in the market support system. Community funds are available tohelp them. A regulation which is in draft goes further. It proposes commonmeasures for launching aid both for a wider range of producer groups andfor second-tier groups. This would make available investment aid for five years after recognition. The definition of such groups and how muchhelp should be given remain to be settled. But, if these common measures were adopted in broadly their present form, aid to producer groups over thenext five years in the Community could be substantial. Over this period for the present Community alone it could be of the order of  200 million, ofwhich 25 per cent would be borne by Community funds (FEOGA) and thebalance by member slates. The operation of this draft regulation in theUnited Kingdom is under consideration.40. In the meantime co-operative associations can seek aid fromFEOGA under regulation 17/64/e.c. for capital investment projects.Decisions on these applications are made by the European Commission.Consultation with interested bodies here on the arrangements for the submission of applications after we have joined the Community is already under way.V.   ORGANISATION41. This Green Paper has defined marketing objectives. It has pointed to the means groups, contract fanning and joint ventures which can help to put them into effect. It has discussed the action which might encouragethese developments.   It has now to consider what organisation is necessary.42. This is not a blank page. There are already bodies activelyseeking better marketing. There are also rules which determine howCommunity (FEOGA) or Government finance can be handled. Communityaid under the draft regulation on producer groups would not be paiddirectly to these groups but to member states as partial reimbursement ofnational expenditure. Neither these grants nor United Kingdom financial aid to co-operative associations could be paid out by a body representing a particular trade or production interest. The Government will not pay fora body which is set up to advance the interests of one sector only. a body of this kind cannot properly perform national marketing functions inthe interests of all parties.43. Subject to this, farmers and growers will now judge whether they need new organisations in their own special interest. A central agencymight be better than the first and second-tier marketing groups at carrying
out some tasks; examples are national advertising, research and qualitystandards to the point of first sale, where grading standards are not laiddown by national or Community rules.44. There is already power to create Development Councils. A council for apples and pears is in being. Ministers can set up a Council if it iswanted by the industry and if Parliament approves. The functions whichcan be given to a Council include promoting the production and marketing of standard products; promoting or undertaking research for improvingarrangements for marketing and distributing products; and promotingarrangements for co-operative organisations for supplying materials andequipment, for co-ordinating production, and for marketing and distributingproducts.* Development Councils cannot enforce membership of a producergroup. They may have the power to raise levies, subject to parliamentary approval, from everyone carrying on business in the industry.45. Farmers and growers may however prefer to pursue their marketingaims through other organisations. In England they have recently set upAgricultural Co-operation and Marketing Services Ltd., and there are centralco-operative bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They havealso proposed that there should be a new arrangement the BritishAgricultural Marketing Development Organisation for co-ordinating their interest in marketing boards and co-operative associations. Producers mayconclude that they should build on existing organisations, with such adapta-tions as they may think necessary. A third-tier organisation which, unlike the first and second-tier bodies, would not trade, exists in embryo.46. There remains the question how national marketing functions areto be organised. The Government will wish first to examine what mightbe achieved by existing bodies. The Central Council for Agricultural and horticultural Co-operation is already promoting co-operation for marketing.It could now give special attention to developments at the second tier. TheIndustrial and Commercial Finance Corporation or a suitably adaptedAgricultural Mortgage Corporation or Scottish Agricultural SecuritiesCorporation could provide finance for marketing improvements. Loanguarantees are given by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and theAgricultural Finance Federation. Commercial sources could step upmanagement, intelligence and procurement services. The commodity roles ofthe Home-Grown Cereals Authority and the Meat and Livestock commission could remain with them. Progress in marketing is hard-earned. It needs theexperience of those who are already promoting it in these ways.47. The Committee of Inquiry on Contract Farming, however, does notconsider that existing bodies are the best means of bringing about the marketing improvements which it wants to see. It looks for &quot; a recognisablenew force in the industry with an entirely fresh modus vivendi and having no old allegiances&quot;.! It has recommended that a new statutory body, theproposed Agriculture and Food Development Authority, should be set up.* These and other functions are set out in the First Schedule to the industrial organisation and Development Act, 1947.t Cmnd. 5099, paragraph 174.
48.  The main tasks which it foresees for this body are:(i) Marketing. The Authority would fuse with the Central Council forAgricultural and Horticultural Co-operation. It would promote first and second-tier groups.  It would foster marketing under contract.(ii) Investment. It would provide risk and loan capital on normal and special terms for co-operative groups or joint ventures with other bodies in food production, processing and distribution.(iii) Management. It would offer central services, including personneladministration and management consultancy.(iv) Procurement and contracting. This would be in the interests ofprocessing, manufacturing and retailing buyers as well as of sellers.The relationship between the proposed new body and the existing bodies withcommodity responsibilities is left open, as the commodity role of theAuthority could not be clearly defined.49. The Committee has rightly distinguished between functions in thenational interest and other commercial services for particular beneficiaries.The Committee itself thought that the various functions; althoughdifferently financed, should be undertaken by the single Authority. But ithas also stated that &quot; exactly how the operation might be mounted is a gooddeal less important than that the action should be taken soon and that itshould be rightly conceived and directed &quot;.* In the light of reactions to theCommittee&apos;s report and to this Green Paper, the Government will nowconsider whether such a body would be appropriate and valuable in the wider context of agricultural marketing and, if so, what functions it should cover and how it should be constituted and financed; or whether any necessary improvements can be secured equally well through existingbodies.50. In general, the choice should not be limited to a new body withthe whole range of functions proposed by the Committee or no changes at all.Other arrangements are possible. This will depend, in particular, on answers to these questions. Should the Central Council for Agricultural and horticultural Co-operation be fused into a new body with a wider role in encouraging producer groups, contract farming and joint ventures? If so,should it be able to provide and, where appropriate, charge for commercialservices, including management, personnel, procurement, arbitration and market intelligence?   Should it have any commodity role?51. The views of all concerned with agricultural and horticulturalmarketing now need to be taken into account.* Cmnd. 5099, paragraph 154.10
VI.   SUMMARY52. Britain is entering a wider European market. There will be adifferent system of agricultural support. In food manufacture anddistribution important changes are taking place. The industry has to looknow at the best ways of developing and improving its first-stage marketing.53.  The objectives should be:(i) Buyers must be able to get both the quantity and quality they need.They will be looking for more bulking, stricter quality standards andmore assured supply.(ii) Contract farming should be developed.   It is a good means ofletting the farmer or grower know what the consumer wants.(iii) There should be a reasonable balance between the buyer and sellerin first-stage marketing.54. Existing marketing channels, such as auctions, markets andmerchanting, match supply to demand. They will continue. But therewill be an increasing role for producer groups. If they are well managedand financed, they can help farmers and growers to adjust their production efficiently to the market. Second-tier groups for marketing willhave a bigger part to play. There will be more joint ventures betweenproducers or producer groups and merchants, manufacturers, distributorsand retailers.55. The Government has considered areas where action might encouragethese developments. These areas are legal and financial obstacles; riskcapital; commercial services; and Community (FEOGA) and government finance.56. Finally, it invites views on organisation; whether progress would best be made through existing bodies; whether or not a new statutory body on the lines proposed by the Committee of Inquiry on Contract Farmingis needed; or whether any other changes in organisation would be valuable.3134376  Dd. 148284  K80   10/72
