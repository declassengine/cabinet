HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 110 COPY NO     0 ^23 October 1972CABINETDEFAULT ON THE HOUSING FINANCE ACT IN ENGLANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. On 29 September the Cabinet (CM(72) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 5)invited me to put in hand the initial procedures for default under theHousing Finance Act and to report further on the situation towards theend of October.2. Birmingham County Borough (CB), South Shields CB, Salford CB,Canterbury CB, Mansfield Borough (B), Slough B, Skelmersdale and holland Urban District (UD), Carlisle CB and Garforth UD have nowresolved to implement the Act,    There is also a good chance thatDoncaster CB, West Bromwich CB and Newton-le-&quot;Willows UD willso resolve within the next two or three weeks.3. The following authorities (all of whom have received a notice that I am considering making a default order against them) are at presentlikely to persist in their recalcitrance:Camden Local BoroughBarrow CBWalsall CBEccles BBedworth UDClay Cross UDHalstead UDConisbrough UD(In addition Long Eaton UD may continue in default over the amount ofthe October 1972 rent increase, in which case I would also send them a notice).    Camden are implementing the Act on rent rebates and allowances but are refusing to increase rents in October 1972.4. The recipients of the notices have one month in which to make representations.    If, when this period expires (in most cases on6 November), any authority listed in paragraph 3 above still showsno signs of changing their attitude, I would feel obliged to make thedefault order which my notice said I was considering.    Failure to makethe default order in such a case would undermine our credibility with both1
our supporters and our opponents.    The default order would require theauthority to remedy the default within a specified period,which, I suggest,should normally be 14 days.5. It seems clear that the recalcitrant authorities in England wouldpositively welcome the appointment of a Housing Commissioner first,because this would place on the Government the odium of making the october 1972 rent increases and second, because they believe that a commissioner would put an end to the loss caused by non-implementationand so reduce the risk of surcharge by the district auditor on thecouncillors responsible.    I have sought to make it clear that authorities must not count on my appointing a Commissioner in preference to otherremedies, including extraordinary audit with a view to surcharge leadingalso to the disqualification of the councillors responsible.    The threat notto appoint a Commissioner effectively broke resistance at Salford CB.Once appointed, a Housing Commissioner might not be easy to withdrawand could well have a difficult time.    I consider therefore that, once a default order is made, the most effective way of ending the default would normally be to refrain from appointing a Housing Commissioner, and to direct the district auditor to hold an extraordinary audit of the authority&apos;housing accounts,    We would hold in reserve the options of appointing a housing Commissioner, obtaining an order of mandamus from the divisional Court requiring the authority to remedy the default, and reducing housing subsidies,6. A direction to hold an extraordinary audit demonstrates theGovernments concern to protect the authority^ ratepayers againstthe misconduct of certain councillors.    If (as is likely) extaordinaryaudit looks like resulting in a surcharge of more than  500 on each ofthe councillors responsible, some of them may be induced to vote for implementation because the surcharge would automatically disqualifythem from election, or from being a member of a local authority, for five years.    If the surcharge was made, the disqualification would normally so change the composition of the council as to result in amajority in favour of implementation, without the need to appoint a housing Commissioner.7. The district auditor would begin the extraordinary audit notless than three days after he had been directed to hold it.    The auditmight take one week.    If the auditor considered that there was a prima facie case for surcharge, he would serve notice on the councillorsconcerned to show why there should not be a surcharge and would give them a hearing.    At that stage the required number of recalcitrantcouncillors may be induced to vote for implementation so as to havea defence against the auditor.    After the hearing the auditor would give his decision and. if he saw fit, surcharge the councillors concerned.    Anycotmcillor surcharged for more than  500 would automatically be disqualified from election, or from being a member of a local authority,for five years (unless the surcharge is removed as a result of an appealto the High Court).    If (after any appeal) the councillor refused to pay the
surcharge, the district auditor could in practice only obtain payment by anorder for attachment of earnings.    The Court makes the order on thebasis of the councillor^ declaration of income.    If he refuses to declarehis income, the Court can imprison him for contempt for periods of up toa fortnight.    But such a situation is unlikely to arise until after theauthority1 s default had been remedied eg by those councillors who hadnot been disqualified or by the appointment of a Housing Commissioner.It seems unlikely that a surcharged councillor would court martyrdom atthat stage by refusing to declare his income, as it would no longer achieve the purpose of frustrating the Act.8. I seek the agreement of my colleagues that1. If, one month after the issue of the notice that I amconsidering a default order, a local authority showed no signsof remedying the default, I should make a default order against them requiring them to remedy the default within 14 days.2. When a default order has been made, I should direct thedistrict auditor to hold an extraordinary audit of the authority&apos;housing accounts.3. I should report further on the situation in about a month.w department of the Environment23 October 1972
