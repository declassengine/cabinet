IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 101 COPY NO      6C3 October 1972CABINET1973 REVALUATION FOR RATESMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the environment. The General Rate Act 1967 requires new valuation lists to comeinto force on 1 April 1973.    Although revaluation is intended to occurevery five years the last Government cancelled the 1968 one and existing rateable values are thus now ten years old.2. The rateable values in the new lists will be on average Z\ times the present values.    The commercial sector (shops, offices, etc. ) hasincreased relatively more, industry somewhat less, with the domesticsector (accounting for about half the total rateable value) only slightlyabove the average (see table below).Domestic    Commercial   Industrial   OtherAllpropertyFactor of Increase        2.56 2.74 2.24        2. 17       2.51Proportion in 50.53 23.74 14.63       11,10    100.0present lists %Proportion in1973 lists  %51.47 25.89 13.06 9.58    100.0Modern houses are expected to rise more than old, and flats andmaisonettes should be closer to the value of houses than at present.Commercial property in London shows large increases.    Increases tend tobe greater in the Midlands and East Anglia which were previously low,so that geographical variations throughout the country will be smaller than at present.3. The new valuation lists have to be published before the end of theyear, but to meet specific provisions relating to the rating of theelectricity industry regulations requiring affirmative resolution in bothHouses must take effect before 15 November.    These regulations, whichwill disclose the average increase in all rateable values, must be laidimmediately after the recess to avoid risk of failure to comply with thestatute.
4. The new values do not in themselves mean higher rate bills,because rates in the pound should be reduced correspondingly.    Howeverthere, will be a gap of several months after the publishing of information on the increases in values before the public will know the new level ofrates, and unless special measures are taken to reduce mi sunder stand-ings considerable public alarm and criticism is to be expected duringthis period.5. Avoidance of these difficulties by postponement of valuation isnot a practical solution for the following reasons:-a. Immediate legislation would be required to authorisepostponement.b. We have no alternative for rates as the principal source of local revenue, but the rating system will cease to be viablewithout regular revaluations.c. Postponement would be vigorously attacked by localgovernment as a political manoeuvre.d. The valuation lists are now virtually complete, many ofthem being currently processed on local authority computers,and have involved nearly three years work for the ValuationOffice.e. Postponement by one year to 1974 would createintolerable problems for the new local authorities, becauseappeals immediately following revaluation cause some uncertainty about the total yield from rates.    Postponement to1975 would not be much better.6.        I would propose to launch a publicity campaign of explanation,but I must warn my colleagues that there will be some hostility to theannouncement.    In view of the difficulties outlined in paragraph 5,however, I seek their agreement that the implementation of revaluationshould proceed.P w department of the Environment3 October 1972
