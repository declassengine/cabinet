-     REPORT OF A WORKING,: PARTY. ON UNJ^H,0YHE!1T STATISTICSSECTION 1L.C.The Remit1.1       This Working Party of officials was set up us a result of a request fromthe Prime Minister for an inquiry into the nature of the unemployment statistics.1c2      The Working :Party adopted as its Terms of Reference:To consider whether the statistics which are at present collected relatingto the registered unemployed, and others in the population of workingage who are neither in employment nor registered as unemployed, need to befurther subdivided, supplemented or presented differently in order toprovide a more accurate indication of the real level of unused labour   .resources in the economy.1.3      The membership of the Working Party included representatives of theDepartment of Employment, Treasury, Central Statistical Office, Department ofHealth and Social Security and the Department of Trade and Industry.    prKr&quot;&quot;flawe&quot;s&apos;The Problem1.4      The increase in unemployment over the past few years has directed public attention to the basis and nature of the unemployment statistics published bythe Department of Employment.   The volume of comment, much of it critical,increased sharply when unemployment in the UK was approaching the figure of one million.   A number of articles, by academics and others, have raised fundamentalquestions.   All these articles discussed the central question of whether the published statistics accurately reflect the &apos;true&apos; unemployment position.   Someconcluded that the published figures are too high, and others that they are too low. v
Summary and couelusions1.5      The report sots out in Sections 2 and 3 the economic, social, legal andadministrative framework within which unemployment statistics are collected andoutlines in particular (Section 3) the constraints imposed by various legal obligations which the unemployed are required to fulfil in order to obtain social security benefits.1.6      Section 4 examines whether there are people who are counted in theunemployment statistics who do not form part of the genuine reserve of labour, andif so whether they should be separately identified.    The Working Party concludesthat:(i) the temporarily stopped are different from&apos; the main body of unemployed and their numbers should be presented quite separately (para. 4.8);(ii) it is not possible to isolate the short-1orni unemployed in the -statistics (para. 4. 12).   However, it is possible to identify the numberwho at the time of the count have been on the unemployment register for  weeks or less, and it would bs . desirable   if this information could beincluded in the Press Notice.   In addition, a standing paragraph should beincluded showing the large monthly turnover of the unemployment register(para, 4*18);(iii) adult students seeking vacation work should continue to be includedin the figures of total unemployment and should also be identifiedseparately, as at present (para. 4.20);(iv) it is not possible to identify categories of those alleged to benot genuinely seeking work^ (paras 4.22 - 4,29), or (with the exception of students) those who are not seeking permanent employment (para. 4.21);(v) there is no case for attempting to distinguish an unemployable groupwithin the unemployment register, (para. 4.34 ^rnd-Lrrpffi);
(vi) it is desirable to continue to treat registered disabled persons as at,present for statistical purposes, excluding from the statistics those whoare unlikely to obtain employment except under sheltered conditions(para. 4.3?*);(vii) the Department of Employment proposes to mount a   series ofexperiments to show whether a special resettlement service should be developed for socially disadvantage^ people (para, 4.3&quot;8*);(viii) a Working Group should be set up to make detailed studies of the characteristics of the unemployed from available data and to consider howany further information which is necessary can be obtained (para. 4.44&quot;).1.7      In Section 5 -    the report discusses whether there are people who areunemployed but not registered,&apos; and if so whether they ought to be counted and by what method.    Its conclusions on this subjet are as follows:-(i) Earlier estimates of the numbers who are seeking work, but not registered as unemployed, have been greatly exaggerated. Preliminary results of the 1971Census of Population are given in para, 5,3,   s&amp;ege-;fes*-Be--e^4&amp;e^e-&quot;,.. ,r^aas^aeapl^yed^r^Sa^-befH%-^i*e^siy-^-3e5^e4*a*ed.    There is no evidence from the ydensus that largenumbers of people have dropped out of the labour force altogether, though there has been a large increase in the number of students and a tendency to earlier retirement among men over 60 (para. 5*1)*aro(ii) The numbers who are in some sense seeking employment but/not registered.   will include many different categories, including those who are verymarginally attached to the labour force and will only enter it on specificconditions of employment (paras. 5.2 - 5*5)*(iii) The Working Party stresses the importance of the UK participating inthe e.c. labour force survey in 1973 (this is a sample survey which willinterview households), and recommends that the possibility of institutingregular interview sample surveys to supplement the existing statisticsCONFIDENTIAL
should bo considered further in the light of experience of the e.c. survey and the General Household Survey (paras 5-6 - 5*^0.1.8      The report examines in Section 6 the influence of forthcoming administrative and legal changes upon the unemployment figures.   These include the improvement ofthe employment service, proposed changes in National Insurance and the introductionof a Tax Credit System.    The Working Furty concludes that it seems impossible ;at present to predict the effect of any of the proposed changes on the unemploymentstatistics, but considers that this aspect of the changes must be kept underreview throughout the planning stages (para. 6.4).1.9      Section 7 examines the presentation of the statistics, particularly in thepress notice.    The following recommendations are made:-(i) The unemployment statistics should be simplified.   There should be asingle aggregate -- &quot;the unemployed&quot; - which should not include thetemporarily stopped.   The technical terms &quot;total register&quot; and &quot;whollyunemployed&quot;, which have caused great confusion, should cease to be used.The figures for the temporarily stopped should be shown separately fromthe unemployed.(ii) School leavers and adult students seeking vacation work should continueto be included in the total of unemployed, though separate figures shouldalso be shown for each of these categories.^ (iii) It is strongly recommended that the best indicator of the trend cr *of unemployment is the seasonally adjusted series of the unemployedexcluding school leavers and adult students seeking vacation work, as^atpresent.(iv) Prominence should be given to the separate trends of unemployment formales and females; to the numbers who have been on the register for lesethan 4 weeks; and to the large turnover of the register.(v) Articles should be published from time to time describing the trends and structure of unemployment over longer periods.1*10 Unemployment percentage rates should continue to be based on the total numberof employees as denominator (para. 2.10).
Vv-y statistics of the unemployed are, needed.2.1   Statistics of the unemployed arc used for a variety of different purposes.Those fall into two main groups which can bo described respectively as &quot;economicindicators&quot; and as &quot;indicators ox social distress&quot;.   The importance ox individualcomponents of the unemployment statistics depends on the purpose for which the statistics are being used.2.2  As an economic indicator the unemployment statistics aro important both for national economic management, and also to provide a comparison between different areas in order to. decide the priorities for Government assistance,   For these purposes they should measure the extent of under-utilisation of available resourcesof labour.   Although the present statistics do not include those who are seeking work but have not registered as unemployed, changes in the published statisticsare generally closely associated with changing levels of economic activity,although normally with some delay.2,3 As indicators of social distress, the- important components include the numbersof heads of families without a job,   the partially disabled who cannot find work,the old, the young, the long-term unemployed, and so on.   In this context the short-term unemployed who are merely changing jobs (with a week or two off inbetween) are of less importance.2,4 These different groups, namely those whoso unemployment is relevant to thoEanagoment of the economy and those whose unemployment is a cause for socialconcern, largely overlap but are by no means identical.   Heither coincide exactlywith the published monthly statistics, which of necessity are confined to thenumbers who register at the local offices of the Department of 33mplo3nnent and whichhave never been presented as anything more than this.   This does not, however, moanthat the statistics cannot provide extremely useful information for both purposes,provided that they aro examined in depth and interpreted with care.7
Definition of the T&amp;iesr.p3.o^Tn,en^, Registeg2,5   For the purpose of this report the unemployment register will be defined as including those persons whe&amp;e-^re-Mi^hs--axe&apos; held at the local offices of the      -Department of Employment &amp;&amp;d Careers Offices of the Youth Employment Service \:ho arc:a) unemployed non-claimants, ie, unemployed persons seeking full-timeemployment but not claiming social security benefits;b) unemployed claimants, ie, unemployed persons who are seeking employment and claiming social security benefits;c) temporarily stopped claimants ie, persons vyho are claiming social security benefits because their employer has no work for them to do on a particularday, but who still have jobs and are expected, to return to them.The phrase &apos;to register for employment&apos; will be used to describe the process bywhich groups (a) and (b) put their names down at the employment exchange in orderto seek a job.   The temporarily stopped, although   they are required to go through an administrative process in order to qualify for social security benefits, do notin fact 1 register for employment&apos;.   They declare themselves to be unemployed (iemeaning that they are not at work on that day, though they still have jobs) axidcapable of and available for work, but in many cases the period of suspension isvery short (sea para 4.4) and they are not in practice seeking new employment daringtheir period of temporary susijension.   The phrase to 1 sign the register&apos; is used to describe the process by which categories (b) and (c) meet their obligation to proveunemployment.2.6  The unemployment register is counted once each month, usually on the secondMonday, by the staff of the local offices^.   Only those who are unemployed on thedate of the count are included;   and because notifications of changes are oftenreceived, belatedly, it is necessary to wait for some days before the count can bscompleted.   These counts provide the data used to compile the unemploymentstatistics which are presented each month in the Press Notice and in the departmentof Employment Gazette. 0o/fs*/F*t f\,F fS?*    r?/\SJJXAJL* *S5 ^Sf*       rs^i/Jr k     &quot; l
Prase.Notice and ifiopart&apos;.nsnt , of. J^lp^ont. Odette2,7  The monthly unemployment probable Notice is normally issued ten days after thedate on which the count of the unemployment register takes place.   Since some of those whose documents are counted will be in jobs and will not yet have notified this factto their employment exchange, it is necessary to wait a week for belated notificationsbefore the count can be finalised.   The Press Notice contains provisional national and regional figures for total registered unemployment and the constituent groupswho arc wholly unemployed, temporarily stopped, school-leavers, or adult studentsseeking temporary vacation work, as well as the latest information about the numbersof vacancies notified to the employment service which remain unfilled.   There is some analysis of the unemployment figures by sox for adults and juveniles separately,Seasonally adjusted figures in the series for fwholly unemployed excluding- school-leavers and adult students&apos; are also presented in the Press Notice.2,8   Final unemployment figures, obtained after more careful scrutiny and computerprocessing of the returns from local offices, are published in the Department ofEmployment Gazette at the end of the month after that to which the figures relate *In addition to the analyses by sox and by region, the Gazette also contains thefollowing detailed analyses of the unemployed:-last industry -    every monthoccupation for whichregistered for work -    quarterlyduration of current -    limited analysis monthly,&apos;  period on the unemployed register fuller analysis quarterlyage -    every 6 months in conjunction withdetailed analysis by durationentitlement to benefit -    quarterlyRecent examples of some of these data are shown in Annexes A and C,P&apos; At&apos;/ i.2.9 The Working Party found that the administrative system by which the press notice is produced is working near the limit of its capacity.   Any significant-&quot;ease in the amount of information presented in the Press Notice would requireincrease in staff either within the Department&apos;s Regional Organisation or at
Headquarters or both depending on the nature of the increase.Calculation of Unsn^loynent Pqrcj?nt3^._Rat.es2.10    V/hen expressed as percentage rates, unemployment statistics axe widely used as indicators of social and economic conditions which affect different groupswithin the population, and, in- particular, groups living in different geographical areas.   .&apos;.&apos;hese percentage rates relate the numbers of registered noornployed to thetotal numbers of employees (employed and registered unemployed) in tho populationsat risk.   It 1ms been suggested that rates calculated in this way overstate thelevel of &quot;real1 unemployment and that self-employed persons, employers, andEM Forces should bs included in the denominators,   Tho following figures reveal the differences between the two methods of calculation:-Unemployrignt Percentage Rates (total register)Great Britain. Monthly AveragesPublished figure Figures using(using employees as working populationdenominator) as denominator1969 2.42 ; 2.221970 2.63 2.411971 3.55 3.25Unfortunately, information about the numbers in the total working population is notavailable for local areas.   The Working Party considers that it would only causeconfusion to use different definitions for the national and local rates and thatthe simplest course is to retain the present method of calculation.
Bcnefitp. available to, unemployed persons3,1    A person who is unemployed-may be eligible for unemployment benefit os a supplementary f*liewaive^-?eir a combination of both or neither.,   Subject to othereligibility conditions being satisfied, flat rate unemployment benefit is payable fora maximum period of 12 months and the rate depends solely on the employee&apos;s previousrecord of National Insurance contributions and on the number of his dependants.   Inaddition an earnings related supplement to unemployment benefit is payable to those&apos; who qualify for up to six months and is based on previous earningso   A supplementary benefit under the Ministry of Social Security Act 1966 is payable to unemployed persons whose income, including unemployment benefit, is considered to be irisuffi-cient for their needs,.   It is based on individual requirement and will normallycontinue (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions) while the person remainsunemployed,,   Credits of ^najbional^^insurance contributiong. are available to most unem-ployed persons with a recent record of employment or registered unemployment for aslong as they continue to maintain their registration at an employment exchange (see3c9 below)oStatutory provisions for unemployment benefit3*2    Under the National Insurance Act 1965 a claimant for unemployment benefit, tobe successful, must show that he is capable of work and is available        employment,3-3 Even if otherwise qualified, a claimant.can be disqualified fcr receiving unem-ployment benefit for a period up to six weeks if:-(1)   he lost his employment through misconduct;(2)   he voluntarily left his employment without just cause;(3)   be refused an offer of suitable employment without good cause;(4-)   he has neglected to avail himself of a reasonable opportunity of suitable employment;
given to him by the employment exchange with a view to assisting him tofind suitable employmentj(6)   he refused without good cause a reasonable opportunity of receiving&quot;-raining.Even if disqualified, a claimant may still be registered for employment.Methods, of claiming imemployment benefit3.4     Claims and Payments Regulations made under the National Insurance Act requireclaims for unemployment benefit generally to be made in person at employment exchan-ges and provide additional powers for disqualification where claimants do notattend, normally weekly, or carry out directions of the employment exchange.   Thereis no specific statutory requirement that claimants must register for employmentbut the requirement for claimants to do so is a general direction by the SecretaryfcA-f P*/*arc*tex* c/1 //rot ok ttwi Jlcuif 5Vei/tfeof State for Social Services and is regarded as essential byj^BrfSS- except for ternp-orarily stopped claimants.   The adjudicating authorities hold registration for employment to be necessary for the claimant to establish that he has demonstratedhis availability for employment by declaring it to the employment exchange and henceto employers who would be interested in employing him.Statutory provisions for supplementary..benefit3.5    Section 11 of the Ministry of Social Security Act.1966 provides that the supplementary Benefit Commission may require any person claiming a supolementarybenefit to be registered for employment.3.6    Regulations define &quot;registered&quot; in such a way that it means both being included in the register of people seeking work and attending at an employment exchange, normally weekly, in the same way as if the claimant had been claimingunemployment benefit.
Practical application of the statutory provisions for supplementary benefit *3.7    The Commission&apos;s power to apply the condition of registration for employ-ment is administered to ensure that a claimant does not receive a supplementary-benefit if he could maintain himself by suitable employment.   The sick, elderly,women wi*h young children and others who could not be expected to maintain them-selves by employment are not required to register for employment and some other small categories may be excused registration or required to register only for part-time work.Statutory provisions for contribution c 11 edits3.8    As explained in para. 3.1 j most unemployed persons with a recent record ofemployment or registered unemployment are entitled to contribution credits whileregistered at an employment exchange,   (^edits^-^s^thu^people-e-^ooi-vi^&quot;g^m^r.plo^Some unemployed persons may be entitled neither to unemployment benefit, usuallybecause they have already drawn it for the maximum period of 12 months, nor to supplementary benefit because their own resources (e.g. an occupational pension) areabove the supplementary benefit levels   Such people may still register for employ-ment to satisfy the conditions for a contribution credit.   Anybody of working age,other than a married woman, is normally required to pay a national insurance contri-bution.   Those who are neither working for an employer nor are self-employed areliable to pay class 3 contributions (as non-employed persons) unless excused.   the class 3 contribution for a man is  1 c20 a week ( 1*33 from 2 October 1972 )c Thereare four main reasons for excusal:   that the insured person is unemployed, isincapable of work, is in full-time education or (if self-employed or non-employed)has an income bestow a prescribed maftAwam. - at present  9 a week.   A G&amp;aee-^^-^es5-Sfers-s-3- contribution can be credited for each week of unemployment or incapacitybut not because of full-time education or small ir-come,13
3,9    The main significance of a credit is that entitlement to retirement pensionor to widows benefit depends on the contribution record throughout the working life of the insured person, although to a lesser extent credits can also count forpurposes of other national insurance benefits.   Without contributions or credits,loss pension would   eventually be payable.     In practice, persons wishing to be credited with contributions for weeks of unemployment are required to register for employment and normally to attend weekly at the employment exchange in a similarway to claimants for unemployment benefit, ^feooptiono^ayo-jaadfr-Bparingly-i-ft-fefaO&apos;is^l-ittle^-^ss^b^^^^f-fojaud^ 8*.ga*iG^--* -4W-wl**&amp;^*6g6ei^i-E-l-&quot;&amp;ha -t-fe^(^U^^is4&amp;g^v^^ad44jre^g^^ There are the same disqualification provisions as forunemployment benefit (see para. 3.3).Special Provisions Affecting Married Women3.10    It is noted in paragraph 3.3 above that married women are immune from thegeneral requirement to pay national insurance contributions.   Broadly speaking, thisis because they have cover for retirement pension on their husband&apos;s contributions(which, of course, also provide them with widow&apos;s benefit where necessary).   Marriedwomen who work are accordingly allowed to opt out of paying flat rate contributions(the employer still has to pay his share) and those who do opt out are naturallyunable to qualify for unemployment benefit or credits because they will not satisfy the contribution conditions.   A woman who opts to pay contributions; on the otherhand, can qualify for unemployment benefit in the same way as a man or a singlewoman, but normally at a lower rate..3.11     gpit.-Qupyl&quot;OiBO^:baa?y--bon a married woman cannot ordinarily receivebenefit jif she is living with her husband.   Where a man and wife are members of thesame household the husband is the claimant and their resources are aggregated; asimilar rule applies where two persons cohabit as man and wife,1&apos;f
Registration of recipients of benefit or credits3.12     It follows from the provisions described above that everybody gettingunemployment benefit, contribution credits or supplementary benefit/must sign the unemployment register.   In the normal way neither unemployment benefit norcredits rre awarded to an unemployed person without his also having registeredf or employment with the employment service, but on practical grounds this require-ment may be drooped for workers on short time who claim benefit for days when theyare not working,,    (Such claimants are nevertheless registered as unemployed andare Included in the monthly count - see paras. A.A - A.8).   A claimant is subseq-uently required to attend the employment exchange, normally every week, to signdeclarations about his unemployment and availability for work.   He remains register-ed for employment until he is known to have got a job or his claim and registrationfor employment lapse for other reasons such as retirement or sickness.3.13    Although everybody getting benefit must be on the unemployment register, it-does not follow that everybody who is on the register must be getting benefit oreven credits^.   There are a number of reasons why there, is always a differencebetween   the numbers on the unemployment register and the numbers getting benefit.One of these is technical and derives from the method of obtaining a count on aparticular day.   At any point in time there will always be some people who areregistered as unemployed, and are so counted, and who will eventually get benefitbut whose claims for benefit on the day of the count .have not yet been decided or who are not yet entitled on that day to unemployment benefit (because of waitingdays) or supplementary benefit (because they still have resources in the shape oftheir last wages).   Other major reasons for the difference are that some people onthe unemployment register have exhausted their entitlement to unemployment benefit(payable for a maximum of 1 year) a-.d have resources sufficient to exclude them from supplementary benefit,&apos;   that they are married women who have opted out of paying contributions;   or they have been disqualified for unemployment benefit for
a period,   A broad analysis of the register of unemployed at 1 Kay 1972 by reference to benefit entitlement is at Annex C,3,14    The&apos;figures In Annex C do not distinguish as a seoarate blocithose whoare disqualified for unemployment benefit under one of the provisions described in paragi. ;h 3*3*   A considerable proportion of claimants for unemploymentbenefit suffer one of these disqualifications for a periods   Some will be aware that they are likely to be disqualified and refrain from claiming or registeringfor employment when they first become unemployed.   Others do claim, then sufferdisqualification but normally remain registered for employment although not entitled to unemployment benefit or credits,3.15    An idea of the numbers involved in disqualification can be got from AnnexD which shows the numbers and proportions of new claimants disqualifiedj. year by year.   These figures need to be set against the corresponding levels of unemploy-lnent, vacancies and claims for unemployment benefit shown in Annex E,   There is an obvious drop in the proportion of disqualifications after 1969 which correspondswith the increase in the numbers unemployed,   A   comparison of numbers disqualifiedfor   refusing suitable   employment with numbers of unfilled vacancies notified to employment exchanges reveals broad similarity in movements over a considerable period of timeIje^ccssl^ty For Claimants to Hegister;for employment,16    Unemployment benefit is intended for people who normally earn their livingby working for others and whose work and earnings have been interrupted.   Thesame applies to contributions credited for unemployment and to supplementary benefit for fit persons under pensionable age.   It is axiomatic that the benefit should be confined to those who intend to work again.   The obvious objective test of whether a person without a job wants to work again is that he should registerfor employment so that he may be submitted for employers&apos; vacancies.   Over 4 million people leave the unemployment  register annually, about one-third of whom16
have been placed in employment through the employment service,   the remainderhaving found jobs some other way or having left the register for other reasons.v/ould be bound to be subjective in nature, dependent on the claimant&apos;s statementof hi3 intentions.   Even with registration for employment there must remainuncertainty about whether all the claimants are genuinely seeking work so longas there are not sufficient vacancies for every claimant to be offered one ormore within a very short time of registering.Apart from the obvious utility of regisiration for employment, any other test17
SECTION 4AC-Docs the UnCiopIpyin^nt Rejrigter contain peopjle^ who aro not part- bgj thegenu in e v a r. reserve o f .1 &amp;bo ur ?ii, 1   The Working Party identified, the following groups for considerationunder this heading,  and sought to examine whether they could or shouldbe separately identified.(a) The temporarily stopped.(b) Those who are out of work on the day of the count but have jobs to go to some time in the near future.(c) Students who want temporary employment during vacation.(d) These not  &quot;genuinely1  seeking work,(o)    The unemployable.(f) Disabled persons.(g) Socially disadvantaged persons.   &apos;(h) Those who are  &apos;working and signing&apos;,  i.e. fraudulentclaimants.    (This groxip was not further considered by theWorking Party because it is currently under examination by a Committee headed by Sir Henry Fisher.)4.2   The groups which different people may wish to exclude from theunemployment statistics to estimate the  &quot;real&apos; reserve of labour have very varied characteristics.    In social analysis ..less concern is usuallyfelt for groups  (a)  to  (d)  and (h)  than for those who need and wantwork to support families but have no employment yet in prospect.&apos;*&apos;3   The groups described above are discussed in the following paragraphs.    In considering each group the Working Party sought to answer two questions s
a.      Does the group Arrant special treatment in. the unemployedregister and/or in the statistical  andbe      can it be counted?LC. C..CThe Temp orar11 y Stopped4.4    Since  1948 the published unemployment statistics have shown,temporarily stopped workers as a separate group but they have been included in the figure of the total registered unemployed.    The&quot;temporarily stopped&quot; are defined as registered persons who,  on theday of the count,  are capable of and available .f or work; who aresuspended from work by their employer but are expected to resumework with the same employer5  and are regarded as still having a job.Some are on short time, losing perhaps only one day&apos;s work in theweek; others arc laid off continuously for several weeks, o.g. as aresult of shortage of materials.    Some are in receipt of substantialwages - a worker on short time may nevertheless earn, more than thenational average;  others got nothing at all from their emtjioyers and,apart from having a job to which they hope to return,  are indistin-guishable from those whose employment has been terminated.Temporarily stopped workers may be paid unemployment benefit fordays em which they get no payment from their employers provided theysatisfy the conditions of entitlement.4.5   The numbers of temporarily stopped workers, identified in the monthly unemployment count have fluctuated widely from under  5.0,000to several hundred thousand,  although the latter figure has only beenreached at times of exceptionally bad weather conditions (as in thewinter of 1963) or time of acute national crisis such as the powercrisis earlier this year.    Although the numbers obviously tend to19r\ ti  **1; r:va      [\ fi A *
rice during economic recessions they arc liable to erratic: fluctuationssince the causes of temporary disruption of production are many.    Thenumbers attributable to particular causes are not separately identifiedand there would bo &quot;considerable practical difficulties in attempting to do this.    Where necess&amp;ry some infornjation can bo obtained fromthe Department of Employment1s Regional Organisation in response to specific enquiries but it tends to be descriptive rather thanstatistical in nature.&apos;&apos;i.6   In several respects the number of temporarily stopped is an unsatisfactory figure and its inclusion in the unemployment totalcan bo highly misleading.(i)    as already indicated it covers a very wide range of circums-tances and degrees of unemployment and these will,  in thenature of things, vary sharply from one count to anothert(ii)    whereas the snapshot method of counting the register on aparticular Monday produces a typical picture of thejobless,  the incidence of short-time working may be such asto make the count on any particular Monday quite untypicalof the extent to which workers are temporarily stopped,(iii)    because workers on short-time would not register at allunless they could got unemployment benefit and they canonly get unemployment benefit by satisfying a complex set of riiles.    These rules favour short-time working withFriday and Monday as days off.    It also follows that wherethe short-time working cannot be arranged in such a way that unemployment benefit is payable  (e.g. where shorter hoursare spread over the full week or where a guaranteed weekP.0
agreement is in force) workers do aot come on to theregister.    Although they may in Tact be un-  ployed on theday of the count they will not be included in the total.It is evident, therefore that while the extent to which workers ore on short time or are temporarily laid of?? may be a matter of some economic,social and political importance,  the monthly count does not in factsupply a reliable indication of it.    The count of the temporarily stopped is in short a by-product of&apos; the unemployment benefit rules and not an accurate index of a particular form of under-employment./   ^^id-vri^e -I-i-e-d-b o -f 1 a t-rat e&apos;4k$^pl^jymoi*t--fe^a*-^.^i^-^f--^i-s--fe^fr0-^i.-4^)--^wo-i?4te^-s-oa-Sii-e-s^t t-iBK^v^^ldr-ia^g^5^^d-iaa-appear-vKHi-l-d--13 em a-inTf^L&apos;l*7   The Working Party considered the possibility of attempting todefino the temporarily stopped in such a way that workers on short time for one or two days in the week are excluded,  or alternativelyto compile and publish statistics about tho extent of short-time working and temporary lay-off from sources other than the monthly count suchas the published monthly employment returns for manufacturing industries,  but these are not regarded as practical propositions.4.8   Ordinary people regard &quot;unemployed&quot; as being synonymous with&quot;jobless&quot;,  and the inclusion of the temporarily stopped in a total of&quot;registered unemployed&quot; clearly exaggerates the extent of unemploymentin the public mind.    The Working Party therefore recommends that thefigures for the temporarily stopped should continue to be published in* Se^i^n-^(-4-^^ .

Unornp 1 oyed -4,9    It will be convenient in this part of the report to cover notonly those who when leaving their previous jobs  (or when joining theregister) know they have a job to go to,  but also the very largegroup who,  although they do not know at the time they register fox-employment that they will get a job quickly,  in fact do so.4.10 The existence of the short-term unemployed is important because iindicates a degree of mobility which is essential to the working ofthe economy.    It is evidence of the way the economy is constantlyadjusting to meet changing conditions and requirements, partly bythe shift of labour resources from declining sectors of the economy to expanding sectors and partly because individuals often change theirjobs for a variety of personal reasons unconnected with the level ofthe demand for labour.4.11 As an index of social distress the number of people in this group is less important then those unemployed for longer periods,  since theperiod of unemployment of all its members is short and in many casesvoluntarily undergone.    However it must be recognised that there areindividuals within the group who suffer- repeated shox-t spells of unem-ployment.4.12 There are, therefore, sound arguments for treating this group insome way separately within the unemployment x-egister, and the working party considered how this should be done.    In general,  it is not
possible to identify those on the register at a particular time whowill obtain employment within a given period in the future.    Clearlythis is true of those who have not found or been found work on theday cf the count.    Of those who have found or been found work at thetime of the count though they have not yet commenced employment,  some,and in particular those who have been placed in work by the local office,  can be identified,  but others,  including many who find workfor themselves,  cannot be identified.    Moreover, it has to be rememberedthat corresponding to those who,  though unemployed, have a definite jobin prospect which they will shortly take up,  there are those who,though in employment,  are under notice of&apos; termination and will shortlybecome unemployed.4.13 There are two basic ways of approaching this problem - throughthe development of flow statistics which could show tho total movementson and off the unemployment register in between monthly counts,  and byspeeding up and giving greater publicity to some elements of the duration figures which analyse the numbers on the register at a givendate according to length of their current spell of unemployment.The Department of Employment has collected information since 1966about the numbers of adults joining the unemployment register each month and about corresponding totals on the register at the beginningand the end of the month.    It follows,  therefore,  that the total leaving the register each month can bo inferred.    The information has been collected mainly as a management tool for measuring the workloadfalling on the individual employment exchanges,  but it has producedsome useful statistics of flows on and off the register.    A specialA as    6^eharticle describing these statistics and what they show wdrl-fc-be published&quot;hoi. 11$ in the Department of Employment Gazette  (September 1972 issue).
4.15 Although,  for various technical reasons,  coverage of thesestatistics differs slightly from the published statistics about thenumbers of adults registered as unemployed,  it is sufficiently closefor the flow statistics described above to be. taken as a reasonableapproximation of the flows&apos; which generate the monthly changes in. the published levels of registered unemployed adults.    It.would be difficult,however,  to include the current flows in the unemployment Press Notice,mainly because figures have to be extracted clerically and cannot boprovided in time for them to be included in the unemployment press notice.    The figures also give rise to some difficulties of presentationdue to the fact that they vary considerably from month to month -partly because of the varying interval between monthly counts (sometimes&apos;t weeks and sometimes 5 weeks),  a-nd-^jax&amp;Xjs-Jhe^au^^pci^.-Y.&apos;.ooI^^:.^c^^^ nr i ab 1 e *4.l6 The statistics published in the Department of Employment Gazetteabout the numbers of persons on the unemployment register analysed byduration of their current unemployment spell also provide some indication of movements on avid off the register between monthly counts; but theseanalyses show the position of the unemployment register on a particularday each month and cannot therefore indicate the full extent of movements on and off the register, becaxisc large numbers of registrantsboth join and leave between successive monthly counts *    Moreover,  itwould be extremely difficult and costly to produce the full detailedduration statistics in time for publication in the Press Notice, which appears on the tenth day after the count but only four working days after the figux-es have been finalised.Kowev-e-^s- $he Working Party f-^-X-t that it was of great importance to
provide some indication in the Preso Notice of the dynamic nature ofthe unemployment -register.    There are,  for example,  over 300, 000 adultregistrants joining and leaving each month,  and in a typical year theEmployment Services place about  l\ million persons in jobs.    the significance of these facts is largely obscured by the nature of the monthly statistics which iDresent only a snapshot of the position on asingle day.    Ideally,  it would be desirable to give full analysesshowing the number of persons joining and leaving the unemploymentregister and the numbers being placed each month, but this is notpossible because of the administrative difficulties outlined above.4.18 However,  the Working Party recommends that two particular piecesl.c.of information should be included in the Unemployment Press Notice.The first of these is the number of persons who, at the time of thecount, have been on the register fox- k weeks or less.    This figurecan be obtained in time for&quot; the Press Notice by special priorityprocedure.    The Working Party also recommends that a standing paragraph should be included in the Press Notice saying that there is a largeturnover on the unemployed register which varies between 300,000 and400,000 each month.    Neither of these figures would, however, meetthe original aim of quantifying the short-term unemployed.Students4.19 During the past few years it has become apparent that significantnumbers of adult students are registering for temporary jobs duringvacation, mainly between July and September of each year but also at other vacation periods.    The numbers were first separately indentified in July 197*i  and a peak of 30,400 students/registered as unemployedduring the 1972 summer vacation.    Students join the unemployment register
for two main reasons.    Firstly,  it is common practice Tor studentsto work during vacations - in some cases to support themselves and in others to provide money for holidays,  etc.  - and secondly,  there are some who may qualify for social security benefits (for example, those with dependants) and such, students are required to sign the unemploymentregister during vacations as a condition of eligibility for benefit.4C20 It has been suggested that such students might be excludedaltogether from the published unemployment figures.    The arguments which have been put forward in favour of this suggestion are:-(a) Students seeking vacation work have not yet fully entered thelabour force.    They should be regarded as &quot;economicallyinactive&quot; and should not be counted as unemployed.(b) Students do not depend upon employment for financial supportthroughout the year.(c) The jobs sought by students are of a temporary or seasonalnature.The contrary arguments are set out below:-(d) Although it is true that students arc not seeking permanent employment,  there are many others on the register who,  although not identified separately,  are in a similar Ccitegory to the students because they seek only temporary employment,  e.g.married women whose availability for work is limited bydomestic circumstances,  and casual or seasonal workersincluding many construction workers-(e) There is no reason to suppose that students who registerduring vacations are any less in need of jobs than many others on the unemployment register,  except in the sense that
they only need employment for certain, months of the year.Students are competing for work with others on the register.(g)    Students who find work arc included in monthly statistics of the numbers employed.    It would be illogical to includethem in the total labour force if they find Work but notif they try snci fail.In view cf these latter arguments,   the Working Party considers thatthe students should continue to be included in the figures of totalunemployment.    However,   they aro in some ways a special category andshould continue to bo identified separately,  as at present.4.21 It may be observed at this point that it would not be practicable to identify a separate group of &quot;persons seeking permanent employment&quot;.This would depend on what is meant by &quot;permanent&quot;.    Most people on theregister are primarily concerned in finding a job and do not know how-long they will stay in it.
Hot &quot;genuinely&apos; seeking&quot;work4.22   It was a condition for ^covenanted&apos; insurance benefit from 1921 to 1924 andfor &quot;standard&apos; unemployment Insurance benefit from 192&apos;; to 1930 that the claimantshould be &quot;genuinely seeking work&apos;.   This condition came to have emotional over-tones, was extremely unpopular end was difficult to define and apply in practice.Normally, claimants were expected to produce evidence of employment they had sought.4.23   In 1929 the Morris Committee, examining the functions of insurance officers,and the nature of the evidence to be required as to the fulfilment of the conditional-ions, reported that it was not possible to prescribe the nature of the evidence which claimants should be required to furnish to prove that they are &quot;genuinelyseeking work&quot;.They recommended that the words &quot;genuinely seeking work but unable toobtain suitable employment&apos; should be abandoned, and that instead of having acondition the test should be by way of disqualification (a) if a claimant has refusedan offer of suitable work; or (b) if there- is evidence that suitable work is available and he fails to prove that he has made reasonable efforts to obtain such work.   TheUnemployment Insurance Act 1930, coining into force in March 1930, repealed, the&quot;genuinely seeking work&apos; conditional;&apos;..-1 and substituted provisions for disqualificationwhere the claimant refused, without good cau-*e, an offer of suitable employment orfailed to carry out airy reasonable written directions given to him by the employment exchange.4.2.4   The very great1 practical difficulties about defining and applying a test of&quot;genuinely seeking work&quot;, and the emotional associations of the words would make itimpracticable to apply it again as a condition for unemployment benefit.   Thedifficulties of definition would make it almost as difficult to find objectivecriteria for identifying those &apos;not genuinely seeking work&apos; in the unemploymentstatistics.
/j,25   Considerable attention ban been given in recent years to men who although belowthe normal retiring age of 65 have retired from their lifetime employment with apension from their employers. - Such occupational pensioners can and do sign theunemployment register, and the last count in January 1971 showed that approximatelyhalf the men on the register aged 60-64 had an occupational pension-.   Currently,therefore, about 60,000 occupational pensioners aged 60-64 are likely to be registered as unemployed.   It is estimated that about half of these are receiving umemployment benefit, and of the remainder about 10,000 are likely to be receivingsupplementary benefit arid about 20,000 will be receiving National Insurance creditsbut no social security benefits (see para. 3*8).   (It should, of course, be notednext-that not all occupational pensioners on the unemployed register are well-off.   some are receiving a pension at a level which, even if it makes them ineligible for supplementary benefit, is too small to pffect their attitude to further employment.;&apos;r.2o   In 1966 Ministers felt that public concern, as evinced by press criticism,Parliamentary Questions and letters forwarded by MPs, were such that the questionof whether there should be additional conditions for receiving unemployment benefit and crediting contributions for unemployment for occupational pensioners should bereferred to the National Insurance Advisory Committee (NIAC).   NIAC reported onthis question in 1968 (Crand 3545, February 19c*9j).   The majority of the Committeeconcluded that there was no satisfactory way of distinguishing occupational pen-sioners who were &quot;genuinely&quot; seeking work from those who were not.   They werenevertheless of the opinion that the normal conditions of entitlement to unemploymentbenefit and credits did not ensure that they were awarded, only to those who wereeffectively in the field of employment.   They therefore recommended the applicationof additional conditions to occupational pensioners generally, linked to tho amountof their pension.   A minority report by Lord. Collison dissented on the grounds that payment of unemployment benefit should not be subject to a means test.
if.27   Draft regulations to implement the- NIAC recomendations, but with rather higher and mere beneficial limits, were prepared and were submitted to NIAC forcpssaciit in the ordinary way.   They attracted an unprecedented volume of criticismby way of representations to NIAC, who, however, broadly endorsed their earlierview, with the same dissent from Lord Collison.   Substantive regulations were introduced in 1970 but, at the time of the General Election, these had not come intoforce.   Soon after the change of government, the Secretary of State for social services announced the withdrawal of the regulations, saying, however, that he saw no other way of dealing with this problem, but that he considered that it should be embodied in primary legislation to be considered by Parliament.-.k,?.B   Provisions for this purpose were included in the National Insurance Bill 1971,the main purpose of which was to uprate National Insurance benefits, but were deletedfrom the Bill against the advice of the Government in Standing Committee.   Underthese provisions claimants with occupational pensions above  jSO a week would havehad to pass a test of further work after retirement to qualify for benefit, and in allcases any benefit payable would have been reduced by the excess of the pension over 18 a week.   At the time this would have excluded only a relatively small number(under 10,000), although It is likely to be increasing year by year, as more andnore people qualify for higher pensions.4.29   The Working Party, like the NIAC, sees no practical method of identifying thoseoccupational pensioners receiving unemployment benefit and/or credits who areregistering solely for these purposes and are not genuinely seeking work.   Itconcludes, therefore, that they must continue to bo included in the unemploymentstatistics while they continue under present legislation to receive unemploymentbenefit and/or credits.
f** fi ?-j SI ff%  i\!: Tl A bIf,J0   Various commentators have suggested that the unemployment register containspeople who can be described as &quot;unemployable&apos;.   There is no doubt that such peopledo exist and that this fact is supported by the experience of the Employment Services.Every employment exchange manager has people registered for employment who areexceptionally difficu.lt to place in work and who seldom hold down a job for more thana week or two.   They tend to be the elderly, unskilled and socially disadvantaged,but they may also be people who simply find it difficult to adapt themselves to theconditions of working life.4.31   Whilst it is possible to point to individuals who are more or less &quot;unemployable(see para, k.&apos;iTT), they do not form a group with a simple set of objective chara-cteristics enabling it to be distinguished with certainty from other groups.   Thecharacteristic of being difficult to place in work might be true of all the membersof a group, but the reasons for it will vary widely between the individuals who make up the group.   Some will be handicapped, mentally or physically; some will live in areas where .there is little demand for their skills; some will not be &quot;genuinelyseeking work.&apos; and will have successfully disguised the fact; and some will be&quot;unemployable1 in the sense described in the previous paragraph.k.J)2   It is clear from this that there is some confusion between the meaning of&quot;unemployable&apos; as a description of certain characteristics of a person, and as adescription of the &apos;employability&apos; of a person in a particular labour market.   Itis this confusion which leads to the apparent contradiction that whilst somevirtually &quot;unemployable&apos; individuals can be identified, the characteristics ofthese individuals cannot be used as a basis for the definition of a wider&apos;unemployable&apos;&apos; group.   In short, the symptom is common to too many ailments to formthe basis of a useful diagnosis.31
4.33 There is a further distinction to be made between the use of the word &apos;unemployable&apos; as a description of a group, and as applied to an individual. The Department of Employment has a duty to do its best to place in work everyone who is registered for employment insofar as this is possible, and it must therefore act on the assumption that everyone is employable. However, it is obvious that some individuals are more employable than others, and that employers are inclined to take a very selective view of the quality of registrants submitted to them.

4.34 The Working Party concluded that there is no case for attempting to distinguish an &apos;unemployable&apos; group within the unemployment register. Such a statistic would be meaningless in either economic or social terms because, under the present organisation, it would consist only of the extreme cases. In any case, difficulties of definition are such as to make the proposition administratively impracticable.

Ofthis latter figure 78,000 persons were classified as suitable for ordinary employ-ment and were included in the published unemployment figures.   The remaining 13,000at^e classified as severely disabled and unlikely to obtain employment other than under special conditions.   This group is excluded from the main unemployment seriesalthough the figure is published separately as part of the information about the disabled Persons Register.4.3?   It is known that the statistics of registered disabled persons Inadequatelyreflect the employment situation amongst disabled people.   On the one hand there?re many unemployed people, who are probably eligible to register as disabledpeople, but Who, for a variety of reasons, do not in fact register as such.   On theother hand there is evidence to suggest that there may well be as many reglstrable,hut unregistered, disabled people^in employment as there are registered disabledpeople in employment.   Bearing these reservations in mind, it is certainlypossible to identify registered disabled persons separately and the Working party has considered whether it would be desirable to identify those unemployed registered
disabled persons who are not severely handicapped separately in the main statistics.However, most registered disabled persons are rendilj employable on their own merits given the right rehabilitation and vocational training and given help tofind the right job; and it would be wrong to suggest anything to the contrary.   It.is true that some registered disabled persons at present classified as suitablefor ordinary employment may be particularly hard to employ.   These tend not onlyto be physically or mentally handicapped but also to suffer from other employmenthandicaps; for example they may be unskilled or socially disadvantaged.   But it is -not possible to identify such people separately.   The Working Party lias thereforeconcluded that it is desirable to continue to treat registered disabled persons forstatistical purposes as at present, and to exclude from the main unemployment seriesonly those registered disabled persons who are so severely disabled that they are .unlikely to obtain employment other than under special sheltered conditions.^! icrs^4at a^abe-ivt^a^Kple^^^^k?cs?e-*e.4.&apos; e-pen e-^Vl^ist-^diKJ^id^X^-.....___Socia 11 y hi sad van t a Red Pc on], e.5*3&quot;  Apart from physically and mentally disabled people, the Department ofEmployment has in recent years grown increasingly conscious of a group of people whouay be described as socially disadvantaged and who suffer from some social handicapthat makes it particularly difficult for them to obtain suitable work.   The Depart-Rent has already concluded a small pilot study to see whether such people could be identified and helped through the provisions of a special resettlement service.   TheDepartment now proposes to mount a series of experiments designed to show, inter-alia, whether a special resettlement service should be developed for sociallyex(Usadvantaged people; whether, if so, it should be/separate service or combined
with the present resettlement service for disabled people; and whether, either forisabled persons, or for socially disadvantaged persons, or for both groups,mproved assessment procedures should be developed.   If the new assessment proce-[lures envisaged were eventually to be introduced on a wide scale they would generatenew and selective data about socially disadvantaged people with special employmentproblems which might males it possible to identify them more precisely and provide some useful indicators about the economic and social significance of unemploymentamongst this group.   However, any prospect of identifying a class of &quot;sociallydisadvantaged&quot; any move precisely than that of identifying &quot;the unemployable&quot; or those &quot;genuinely seeking work&quot; must lie well in the future.Special Surveys of the UnemployedIt has been proposed by at least oiiO commentator that special surveys of thechar act eristics of the unemployed should be carried out annually.   They should belimited to people out of work for more than 2 months and should aim at identifyingthose who aro not fit for normal employment.   These people should be taken off theunemployment register and transferred to a. separate register, to bo treated as a social problem rather than an employment problem.In 1961 and again in 196&apos;!- the Ministry of Labour carried out surveys of the characteristics of the unemployed.   Local offices were asked to classify those onfitCthe unemployed register under the following headings:&quot;a. Should get work without difficulty.b. &apos; Will find difficulty in getting work because of lack oflocal opportunities.c. Will find difficulty in getting work because present qualifications,experience or skill are not acceptable to employers.d. Will find difficulty in getting work on personal grounds, viz, age,physical or mental condition, prison record, attitude to work,
colour, lack of English, restriction on availability, lack offinancial incentive, non-members of trade unions or other reasons.(j. oThe summary of the first results of the 19o&apos;i survey (Ministry of LabourGazette, April 1966) showed that out of the 237,000 men who were wholly unemployed in 1964 some 143, 000 were classified as difficult to place on personal grounds.Nearly three-quarters of them were placed in this group because of their ago or because of their physical or mental, condition.   But there were also 24,000 havingdifficulty because of their poor attitude to work.4.42&quot;&quot; These surveys were not repeated, although in 1970 the Department of ^Employmentanalysed in depth a sample of the disabled people who were on the unemploymentregister on 1 October in that year.   The reason for this was partly because thesurveys were enormously expensive in staff time but even, more because it was foundthat the classifications involved a great deal of subjective judgement and variedfrom area to area.   Whether a person was classified as &quot;will find difficulty in getting work&quot; depended not only on the characteristics of the person but also verymuch on where he was living.   Several years later the National Institute of Economicand Social Research published an article criticising the validity of these surveys.4.43- The Working Party considers that the 1961 and 1964 surveys were not satis-factory but that there is nevertheless a need for more information about the characteristics of unemployed people than Is readily available at present.   this deficiency may partly&apos;be remedied by better assessment procedures on the lines$7discussed in paragraph 4.32-, if these are introduced on a wider scale, but theinformation available from these procedures will necessarily be limited.u4-r The Working Party concludes that there is a case for setting un a Workingwoup to make detailed studies of ttes characteristics of the unemployed.   It might36
direct its attention to this question without preconceived ideas about how the characteristics are related to the abstract and undo finable qualities with which wolave been concerned in the foregoing paragraphs.   Its terns of reference should include an examination of the objective criteria by which the unemployment registercan be described - age, sex, duration of current spell of unemployment, time in lastjob, reasons for leaving last job, occupation, industry, past spells of unemployment,whether in receipt of occupational pension, value of pension, number of dependants,other sources of family income; and should further include an investigation of the sources of such information - National Insurance and Department of Employment records,Censal information, special studies (including the current research project on long-term unemployment being undertaken by the Department of Social and AdministrativeStudies at Oxford), National Incomes Survey, Family Expenditure Survey, GeneralHousehold Survey etc - with a view to seeing how far the existing information fromthese sources can be built up into a comprehensive account of the characteristics ofthe unemployed; and, finally, how any further information which is necessary butnot available from existing sources can be obtained.   The Working Party recommends that such a Working Group should be established.Uf^  To summarise this section the Working Party has examined the various groupsconsidered in paragraph k,1 and concludes that without legislative changes all the groups mentioned (except the temporarily stopped) are properly included in theunemployed register.   Many of the groups present insuperable difficulties of identification and those groups that can be identified - the temporarily stoppedand students    are already shown separately in the Press Notice.
Are there people who are really unemployed but not, registered?5.1     Previous sections of this report have been concerned with those criticisms of the published unemployment figures which suggest that the figures includepersons who are not 1 really unemployed&apos;.   Another criticism generally levelledat the unemployment statistics during recessionary periods is that the publishedfigures exclude some people who are genuinely seeking work but are not registered as unemployed.   An article in the Times of 2 March 1972 stated that between 1966and 1971 the population aged 13 and over rose by 1,338,000 whilst the working population fell by 790,000.   Thus, more than 2 million potential workers appearedto have dropped out of the labour force altogether, in addition to the increaseof over 400,000 in the published unemployment figures.^-&amp;ier-tly-a- t^xHfa^ted&quot;&amp;uggestc-d-4hat^the^nr^^5*2    The estimate given in the Times was incorrect for the following reasons:-a.   The figure of the increase of the population aged 13 years and over inthe period 1966-71, quoted as 1,338,000 was apparently obtained by comparing the 1966 Sample Census results (which are known to have been an under-enumeration of the true population) with an officialprojection of the 1971 population which was made before the 1971 Censusand was subsequently found to have been much too high (as was pointedout when the preliminary results of the 1971 Census were published inAugust 1971)&quot;   The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys are notyet able to give a precise figure of the true change in population over this period, because the figures for 1966 are still being reconsideredin the light of the 1971 Census.   However, the OPCS have informed us that the increase in the population aged 1$ and over in the period
 &apos;5 The conclusions in para. 5.2 are based mainly on the preliminary results ofthe 1971 Census and. particularly on the apparent changes in the size of thetotal population and changes in the numbers who were economically inactive,i.e. those not,in employment, seeking employment or waiting to take up a job.Among the economically active population the number of persons who describedthemselves as either seeking work, or waiting to ,iake up a job was larger thanthe number registered as unemployed.   TMs also happened in the previouscensus in 1966 and. there are two main reasons.   Firstly, the Census figures include many who were sick, whereas the unemployment register is confined tothose who are available for work.   Secondly, the numbers who describe them-selves as seeking work include many different categories, ranging from thesewho urgently need a job, to those who are only marginally attached to thelabour force.   Many in this last group do not take very active steps to finda new job and are not sufficiently concerned to register as unemployed.   Whenestimating numbers in this category, it is necessary to deduct the numbersout of employment because of sickness, but this group cannot yet be identified-fied from the provisional result.0, of the 1971 Census.   On the assumption thatthe numbers sick were approximately the same in 1971 as in 1966, it is veryprovisionally estimated, that the numbers who described themselves as eitherseeking work or waiting to take up a job in April 1971; and who are neithersick nor registered as unemployed, amounted to some 100,000 males and up to be .c*.   In 1966-71 there was a very large increase in the number of studentswith a corresponding fall in the numbers aged 15-24 who were workingor seeking work.   This, combined with a tendency to earlier retirementamong men over 60, accounted for practically the whole of tho fall inthe proportion of men who were economically active.   Activity ratesfor women over 25 continued to rise, exceeding earlier forecasts.c d-s   Thus there is no evidence from the census that large numbers of people have dropped out of the labour force altogether.   The onlyidentifiable additions to the so-called &quot;labour reserve&quot;, apart fromthose mentioned in b, consist of students and some &apos;s5,000 men whohave retired between the ages of 60 and 65.More detailed figures are contained in Annex Eh   Further analyses and comparisons with estimates of the working population derived from other sources cannot be made until the receipt of the next set of census results towards the end of this year,which will include in particular estimates of the numbers of self-employed in1971.   When these have been received, the Department of Employment proposes to publish a full article on this topic.
waiting to take up a job &quot;but were not registered as unemployed,   it may alsobo mentioned that in 1966 nearly half the people in this category had alreadyfound a job and were waiting to take it up,r;,y)&apos;l-.. It is probably reasonable to assume that the group described in para .5-2 babove is made- up largely of the following categories, none of whom are seeking the help of the State employment services in finding a new job:a. Harried women who are not eligible for unemployment benefit becausethey have exercised their option not to pay National InsuranceContributi ens,b. Occupational pensioners who (l) have a pension above the level atwhich they would be eligible for supplementary benefit and have notclaimed unemployment benefit or credits; or (2) have exhausted theirentitlement to unemployment benefit and are not continuing registrationfor credits only.c. Persons above the normal retirement ages who are receiving Stateretirement pensions but are seeking work.to supplement their incomes.d0   People who are unemployed for a short time between jobs and have eithernot bothered to claim benefit or know they will be disallowed underthe current rules.e.   People who say that they are unemployed because they do not wish (fortheir own reasons) to reveal that they ere employed.In the case of women, a further factor is known to influence the figures.Many of the married women who state they are seeking work may be expressing a future intention rather than a current activity.   In practice, they are moreinclined to attach conditions to the work they are prepared&apos;to take - workingtours to suit their domestic circumstances, ease of travel, the availability of
nursery schools, and so on - and they can only be described as unemployed in arestricted sense.   They are, rather, part of a labour reserve which can beactivated when the conditions are right.   This kind of labour reserve extendsbeyond those who may signify they are in some sense currently seeking work, and can apply to some of those women who would not describe themselves as currentlyseeking employment but who may be persuaded to take up employment given the -rightconditions.   This may be true also of both men and women below the age of 20 and above the age of 60.   When the demand for labour is slack, as at present, moreyoung people than would otherwise be the case continue their education afterstatutory school-leaving age, and more of those over 60 elect to retire from employment.   To some extent the return, of a high demand for labour would encourageboth more young people and more elderly people, to enter or remain in the working population.5v5&quot;&quot;rh-ese-nronsi^^sc^Mng^Hpio^es*t-r^ those&quot; whooiead.-.v;oj;k..-an4^^^employmentsaeti^ty-4-B--seak4ng--w^  -Labour Force Surveys5.0    Such criticism gives rise to the more fundamental consideration of whether there is a case for abandoning the present method of counting the registeredunemployed and substituting.periodic labour force surveys (such as those carriedout in the United States, the German Federal Republic and elsewhere) to identify the basic groups among the economically active and economically inactive parts of
the total population.   It has been argued that such surveys could provide a more comprehensive analysis of the real levels of the labour force, including thenumbers seeking work but not registered for employment.   It has also beensuggested that labour force surveys could be xised to obtain more information about tiie availability for work of certain fringe groups of employed or unemployed workers, for example, occupational pensioners.5//     labour force surveys are sample surveys of households, and estimates derivedfrom them are subject, therefore, to considerable sampling errors.   Other diffi-culties in processing or interpreting the information obtained from such surveyscan arise because of possible bias, and because it is not always obvious how togross up the sample estimates.- Nevertheless, labour force surveys can provide information which is not available from other sources, except where the relevantprojects are covered in Censuses of [population..   If based on adequate samplesthey can provide good estimates of national ratios and of changes in those ratios,eg, for activity rates or the percentages seeking work.   The amount of detailedinformationjis limited by the sampling size and other considerations, and consi--derably less detail could be provided for individual regions than for the country as a whole.5.8    The present unemployment statistics provide detailed monthly statisticalsummaries from approximately a thousand local employment exchange areas.   Separateunemployment rates are published or made available for several hundred local areas(grouped where necessary into self-contained travel-to-work areas).   considerable importance is attached to the local area unemployment rates, which provide one ofthe main criteria for monitoring regional policies on unemployment and forclassifying certain areas as Development- or Intermediate Areas.   Despite the criticisms to which they are subjected, statistics based on numbers on theunemployment register at employment exchanges have been reasonably adequate for
this purpose and, indeed, provide the only source from which frequent local areaunemployment figures can be obtained.   (The only other possible source for obtaining unemployment estimates for local areas is through the five-yearly ensuses of population.)5.9    For these reasons the information about unemployment obtained from labour force surveys would complement, rather than replace, the present detailed statistics of the registered unemployed.   Inevitably, there would be difficulties in resolvingor ex-plaining differences between the employment and unemployment estimates derivedfrom labour force surveys, and the national aggregates obtained from the presentsources.5.10   Some recent information of the kind provided by labour force surveys is becoming available to the United Kingdom.   Preliminary estimates are already available from the 1971 Census of Population and, to a limited extent, from theGeneral Household Survey, although the latter is a relatively small survey basedon only 15,000 households a year^/^.eelri^i33^eems apparent that population or household surveys arelikely to produce estimates of numbers seeking work which would be in excess of thenumbers registered as unemployed at employment exchanges, though some of these per-sons may be only marginally attached to the labour force. ,Ljeh^a*^4rhe-e en su^Einee-the.se-figures-i^present-the-exoess-of-&apos;the--n.u!ribirs-report ed--as-seeking-woi-kthat-popu-latien-er^-i^^3S!^jing^ww4frfw&amp;i^fa^^  -toerdp^sed--at^Hpl^5!weitt--exc4ianges.   Data from the General Household Survey suggestthat there are vary few men in the prime working age groups who have for noapparent reason dropped out of the labour force, in the. sense that they are neitherin employment nor seeking work.- 4v
,rj-11   The Working Party concludes that while labour force surveys would not provide an acceptable substitute for the present unemployment series, they mightbe used in future to supplement the present information, by enlarging our knowledge of the labour force as a whole and of its component parts.5.12   The PEC intend to mount a labour force survey in member countries in 1973for the purpose of obtaining labour force statistics on a standard basis for individual member states.   It is hoped that the United Kingdom will participateand that the survey will be addressed to about 100,000 households (approximatelyhalf per cent of the total).   The survey will enable personal characteristics of the individuals in those households, such as area of residence, age, sex,marital status and nationality,&apos; to be compared with their economic activity duringthe survey week.   The survey will distinguish those in employment and those un-employed and seeking work, and for the last group further questions will alsodistinguish the nature of the employment being sought, eg, full-time or part-time-work; regular, temporary or occasional work or self&quot;employment.   Further questions will see]&apos;; to identify the circumstances under which employment is being sought,eg, after leaving previews job for specified reasons, together with some detailsabout the previous employment, if any.   There will also be questions which dis-distinguish between those officially registered as unemployed and others and whetherthe individuals are entitled to unemployment benefits. .5.13   The Working Party concludes that the proposed e.c. labour force survey,together with the recently introduced General Household Survey, will providevaluable experience of the data which can be produced from these sources, andrecommends that the use of labour force surveys should be considered further inthe light of that experience. j &quot;JAnnual surveys of the size of the e.c. survey would be Very expensive, but it is
possible that the General Household Survey may be able to provide approximateannual estimates of- the unregistered unemployed, which would be helpful in assess-ing overall labour resources and pressure of demand.

Two recenc major changes have been the introduction of the redundancy payments scheme in 1963 and the introduction of earnings-related unemployment benefits in 1966.     A study made for the Department of Employment(&quot;Effects of the Redundancy Payments Act&quot;:    OPCS Social Survey Division, 1971) didnot suggest that, those persons who received redundancy payments were more selectivein obtaining new jobs and remained longer on the unemployed register than otherunemployed persons, ^f^frnrnrirb^^r^o6nsfrt)ci ed &quot;by t*&apos;l&apos;g&quot;J&quot;t?^&apos;-&apos;^ eter3red-stvK?y-&quot;e?rst&apos;-mrei^-i-n&apos;^th.e-197?lii&apos;.proye!ient of the employment seryiee6,?       Improvement of the employment service may reduce the length of time takenby registrants for employment to secure new jobs, which will help to reduce thehigh level of the unemployment register.     On the other hand, however, a more efficient service may also attract on to the unemployment register some of thoseunemployed persons who were hitherto unregistered (see section 5).     Thus, theWorking Party  o:^hs it impossible to assess the net effects of either past changesin the efficiency of the employment service, or of the improvements foreshadowed in &quot;People and Jobs&quot;.L-c.Pro rosed changes in National Insurance6.3      Under the proposals in the White Paper &quot;Strategy for Pensions&quot;, the presentmixture of flat-rate and graduated contributions for employed persons and their employers will be replaced by wholly earnings-related contributions collected
through PAYE. National Insurance cards will no longer be used for employees. These changes are expected to come into operation in April 1975. Under the new arrangements, entitlement to unemployment benefit will be based on the attainment in the relevant income tax year of a specified level of earnings on which contributions have been paid (about one quarter of annual average earnings) and not on the payment of a precise number of weekly contributions. The reconstruction of the national insurance scheme (and the possible introduction of a tax-credit system) will also have important implications for the future structure and level of unemployment benefit. The effect of all these developments on unemployment statistics should be kept under review by the Departments concerned.

Conclusion

6.4 Whilst it seems impossible at the moment to predict the effect of any of the proposed changes in administrative organisation or legal provisions upon the size of the unemployment register, the Working Party considers that this aspect of the changes must be kept under review throughout the planning stages. This is necessary both to maintain the integrity of the series of unemployment statistics, and to give adequate warning to Ministers of their possible effect of changes upon the sine of the unemployment register.


Publication of nnemrloywent StatInticp7.1       The recommendations made earlier in this report imply a simplification 0the unemployment statistics.     There would he a single aggregate - &quot; theunemployed&quot; - in which the temporarily stopped would not be included.     Thetechnical terns &quot;total register&quot; and &quot;the wholly unemployed&quot; would cease to beused;    in the past they have given rise to a great deal of confusion (includingthe description of the total register as the &quot;jobless15, when in fact it includethe temporarily stopped who have jobs; and confusion of the wholly unemployedwith so-called &quot;hard-core&quot; unemployment).     The Working Party recommends thatschool-leavers and adult students seeking vocation wok should continue to beincluded in the total of unemployed, though separate figures would be shown foreach of these categories.     Figures for the temporarily stopped should continueto be shown but quite separate from those relating to the unemployed.     It is strongly recommended, however, that as the best indicator of the trend ofunemployment, attention should continue to be focussed on the seasonally adjustscries of the unemployed excluding school-leavers and adult students seekingvacation work, as at present.7.2      Tables containing analyses of unemployment, which at present are onvarying bases, would in future relate to the single total of unemployed.     TheWorking Party has noted these analyses in paragraph 2.8 and a fuller list isGiven in Annex A with examples of the way they shed important light on the structure and composition of the unemployed.7.3      At present, the most urgently needed statistics are published in the PreNotice and more detailed analyses are published later in the Gazette.     TheWorking Party has considered a number, of alternative ways of expanding theinformation available when the Press Notice is issued to give a more complete and detailed picture of the unemployment register at the time when it attracts
greatest interest.corisicidered that release of detailed information ina second monthly unemployment press notice published about 3 weeks after thecount date and 3 weeks before data now appear in the Department of EmploymentGazette would serve little useful purnose, because interest wanes after the initial impact of new monthly unemployment totals.7oh      Ideally, it would be helpful if the present detailed analyses of-unemployment by duration, occupation and industry for the current month,and add-itional information about other personal attributes of tho unemployed considered in sections h and 5i could be available at the time of issue of the pi-ess/notice.They could then be used at that time for supplementary background information.However, under existing arrangements the detailed analyses of unemployment byduration, occupation and industry are prepared by computer processing of the returns made by over 1*100 employment exchanges and careers offices.     Monthlyanalyses of unemployment by duration arid by industry.are usually available about weeks after the count date, and the quarterly occupational analyses areavailable after about 6 weeks.     Total summary unemployment figures are extracted from the main returns before despatch for processing and are  Aggregated clericallyfor presentation in the press   &quot;otice some 10 days after the count date.Expansion of the contents of this jpVess/J.otice to include details about duration,occupations or industries would necessitate an extension of these clericaloperations.     The costs of all but the most limited of such expansions seemprohibitive under the present system of data collection and collation, particularly at a time when local offices are already working under heavy pressure.49
7,5      It will be possible, however, to provide the present and certain newanailysc-s of additional characteristics of the unemployed very speedily if andwhen the unemployment register is placed and maintained permanently on a computer.     Plans to do this arc under active consideration within theDepartment of Employment and trials on a small scale have already taken place.There remain some difficulties to be overcome and it is unlikely that a systemof this kind could be brought into operation in less than two or three years^Although the staff costs of such a system would probably be a little greaterthan those expended now on unemployment statistics and some capital outlay willbe necessary, it would, if adopted, provide additional statistical analyseswith far greater speed and flexibility than is possible at present.7.6      The Working Party envisages that the monthly Press Noti.ce will includefigures of unemployment on the lines described in paragraph 7.1 -     In addition,it is suggested that it would be helpful to give more prominence to the separatetrends of unemployment for males and females, to show the numbers who have been onthe register for less than four weeks, and to explain that the unemployed are notthe same people each month but that there is a very large turnover, with normally(&apos;: c/oju/y   similar mma;/between 300,000 and 400,000 joining find/leaving the register each month. this includes the large numbers who both jot a and leave the register within the samemonth and so do not appear in the monthly counts at all.7,7      The Working Party also recommend that articles should be published fromtime to time describing the trends and structure of unemployment over longerperiods. &apos;SO
