DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 105 COPY NO     6512 October 1972CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT NEGOTIATIONS 1972Note by the Secretary of State for the environment. I attach an interdepartmental note by officials giving a preliminaryappraisal of the problems which will arise in the forthcoming rate support grant negotiation for, on this occasion, the single year 1973-74.2. The main issues which we will have to decide will be:-i.       what forecast of total expenditure we can accept asrealistic in the light of the pressures on the services, the improvements we want to see and the need for restraint in public expenditure;ii.       what proportion of this expenditure should be met bygrant and thus what burden to leave to be borne by rates;iii. how far to adjust the incidence of the rate burden betweendomestic and non-domestic ratepayers;iv. whether to make Increase Orders to cover increases inprices for past years.3. We will not have sufficient information to take any decision on thefirst issue until the first stage of negotiations with the local authority associations have taken place.    Proposals will be brought forward aboutthe 23 October.    Meantime I draw attention to the preliminary appraisalby officials.4.        We can, however, now take a view on issues ii. and iii - the objectives to be sought in determining the level of grant.    Are we preparedto make an increase of perhaps 2 per cent or more in the grant rate in ordeto keep the rise in average rate poundage to a level consistent with theprices and incomes package?    Paragraph 12 illustrates how this might bedone.1
5. On issue iv. I suggest that, in view of the obvious need to restrain the growth of rates next year, we could not deny local authorities the fullbenefit of increase orders.6. I therefore invite Cabinet: -i. to take note of the preliminary forecast of localauthority expenditure in 1973-74 and later years;ii. to agree that in determining the level of grant for nextyear, we should seek to ensure that the rise in average ratepoundage is consistent with the prices and incomes package;iii.       to agree that increase orders should be made in respectof 1971-72 and 1972-73.P w department of the Environment12 October 1972./2
RATE SUPPORT GRANT NEGOTIATIONS 1972NOTE BY OFFICIALSIntroduction1.     Negotiations with the local authority associations to settlerate support grant for 1973-74 will start shortly and will finishwith a meeting of the associations with Ministers on 20 November,The timetable  (set out in Annex A) is very tight because the ordermust be approved by the Commons before Christmas.    In the light ofexploratory official talks with the associations, Ministers will,on or about 26 October, be invited to agree on the limits withinwhich the negotiations should be conducted,,    In the meantime,this paper seeks to set the context of the negotiations, tentativelyforecast their course and seek the initial guidance of Ministers on some of the main issues likely to arisee2.     A note on how the rate support grant system works is given in annex B, but it involves:(I)    a forecast at constant prices of what the aggregate&apos; relevant1 expenditure of 8.11 local authorities should bein the grant year having regard to the demand for servicesand the rate of improvements which are considered appropriate in the light of economic circumstances, and(II)   fixing the total amount of grant to be paid towards such expenditure;Outturn for 1971/72 and 1972/33.     The starting point for the forecast is the outturn for the lastfinancial year 1971/720   Total relevant expenditure x^as  k,Wim ascompared with a forecast based on the 1970 RSG Order updated by the allowances for prices already made and first estimates of those yet to be made in increase orders for price increases of  k,1l5m.    some further allowance for price increases will probably be justifiedwhich will reduce the difference between forecast and outturn,,   Thisvariation between the forecast and the outturn is well within the margin of errors in the returns made by local authorities and Inthe estimation of price increases.    The figures need adjustment tomake them consistent in definition and price basis with the figures in the 1972 PESO report     (see Annex B para 6).    This gives a public expenditure outturn which will be less than  3*630m compared withthe figure of  3,601)..6m given in the PESC report Special Analysis.The outturn is the aggregate of the uncontrolled expenditure of1 lj.00 local authorities and to have been able to forecast it soaccurately is very satisfactory.1 .
However, within the total there are some variations betweenforecast and outturn for individual services.    Spending onhighways and miscellaneous local services was slightly belowforecasts but that on education and health services somewhat above.The number of teachers leaving the profession was less than hadbeen forecast, so that 3*000 more were in post In 1972 than hadbeen expected.,   Unit costs of advanced Further Education are higherthan had been allowed for^ and authorities had not been able toreduce the overheads associated with school meals to the extentforecast as a result of the reductions in meals.   Expenditure on local authority health services reflected the response of localauthorities to the Secretary of State&apos;s requests to continue tobuild up these services so that they are transferred to the newhealth authorities in a strong and viable condition.    There is no evidence that local authorities were able to achieve the  10m&quot;efficiency&quot; cut imposed on the forecasts in 1970.5.     The only evidence at present available of the probable outturnfor 1972-73 is the rate estimates of the local authorities whichhowever include the authorities allowances for the likely Inflationthroughout the year.    In view of the experience of inflation in theperiod before local authorities fixed their rates, these estimatesdo not provide a very good basis for forecasting but were probably on the high side.    On the other hand the factors leading to increased expenditure on ediication and health service will have continued to apply and there are indications that the new social service departments are developing more rapidly than had been thought likely.    In the light of this and of the analyses of theoutturn for 197*1-72, the best guess that can be made at present isthat 1972-73 outturn may be as much above forecast as 1971-72.Implications for 1973-7^4- and later years .6.     The PESO report envisages a rate of growth of k*k% for 19714-75and later years with a higher figure of 5*8$ for 1973-714 mainly because of the transitional costs of local government reorganisation.Much of the growth arises from demographic factors without any improvement in services and the remainder derive.^ from improvementsgenerally urged on local authorities by Ministers.   A recent reviewof the possibilities of reducing the burden of rates has shown thatthere is no scope for significantly reducing local authority expenditure in 1973? although some changes may be possible by 19714as a result of changes in function such as the proposed transferof health services from local government and of other changes in egislation on local government finance.   Thus with the higherstarting point suggested in paragraph 5 above, the present indicationis that the outcome of the rate support grant negotiations may be atotal forecast for local authority expenditure some  20- k0m   abovethe present PESO provisions for 1973-714 of  3,935m with similarincrease in later years (before adjusting for the policy changesreferred to above) although the effect of some of the factors leading to higher spending in 1971/72 such as the reduced wastage of teachers,may be less important towards the end of the Survey period.2.
Rate Levels-7,     The average level of rates levied, by local authorities dependsprimarily on the total of expenditure and the proportion of that met by grant.    In addition the rates in the pound levied on dwellingsare reduced by an amount prescribed by the Secretary of State for the environment, the loss of income to local authorities being compensatedby the domestic element of grant.   For- the first ij. years of RSG-,total grant increased by \% steps each year from in 1967-68to Sl% in 1970-71, the increase being applied almost entirely to therate reduction on dwellings which increase from  d in 1967/68 to1 s.8d.  (8.3p) in 1970-71.    Over these years domestic rate poundagerose by only 2$% while earnings grew nearly l\.0a/o.    However in 1971-72and 1972-73 average domestic rate poundage rose by 1[lJi.$ and 11.6$respectively, considerably faster than earnings.    This accelerationin domestic rates is in part due to the decision in 1970- to increasegrant by only, ^% steps from $7% to $715% and 58% with increases in domestic adjustment of only 1 p (from 8.3p to 9ljp and 10-gp) and in part to the increased provision that authorities have been making forinflation....,....8.     Each authority must decide for itself what provision to make inits rate estimates for inflation, but in making their rates for 1973they will no doubt have in mind that even if pay increases are limited to  2 p.w. this would represent 8$ on their salary and wagesbill (since many local government employees are paid less than 25 p.w.), and assuming       increase in costs of goods and services(which amount to -g- of the total), an overall aiioi-jance of 7% wouldnot be unreasonable.9.     Moreover in 1973 the re-valuation will lead to some shift inincidence of rates from non-domestic to domestic property.    some further increases might be expected because authorities are likelyto add a little to their rate poundages to aliox&apos;/ for amounts whichratepayers may withhold pending settlement of appeals againstrevaluation, but this may be offset by reductions caused byauthorities running down balances before reorganisation.10.    Thus talcing into account the increased expenditure forecast in para 6, the provision for inflation suggested in para ( 8, and theannual increase in total rateable values of about 2.2%, it seems likely that if no change was made in the percentage of totalexpenditure met from grant average rate poundages next year mightrise by 10.6$ from 91 .9p to 101 .6p (on current valuations).    Talcinginto aceount the 10-^p domestic adjustment, the average domesticpoundage would increase from 81^-p to 91.1p or 11.8$.-11.   However, there would in any case be an expectation of at least75-$ increase in the rate of grant, in line with the progression inrecent years, and if it could be shown that this was not enough toprevent domestic rates from continuing to rise faster than earningsthis would establish a case for considering a 1$ increase in therate of grant (to $9%).    With a  8ir$ rate of grant,  the increase3.
being entirely devoted to domestic rates, the prospective increasein domestic rates would be from 91 v-% to o9p or 9.3%, (1 ) and witha  9$ grant it would be to 87.Tp or 6.9$,^l).    Only exceptional circumstances would establish a case for considering any further measures to mitigate the increase in rates in advance of any special measures which, might accompany the reorganisation of local governmentin 197k. f especially as a cone ens s ion now would to some extent pre-emptthe scope for further measures later.12*    But the priority now attached by the government to combatingprice inflation and,  in particular, the proposals put forward inthe tri-partite discussions with the OBI and TITO require considerationof the possibility of a further exceptional inc. re as o in the percentageof relevant expenditure to be met by government grant.    Thus, to limit the avorago increase in rates to       would require an increase ingrant percentage from  8 to 60,3/6 (ie about  126m extra grant) and. to limit the increase to       would require a grant of 60.7% (an extra 138m),    Due to the effect of the domestic elemerat, the percentage increase in domestic rates would be slightly higher than the non-domestic percentage/   On the other&quot; hand, to limit the increasein domestic poundages alone to       (leaving non-domestic to rise bythe full 10.6$) would require an increase in the domestic adjustmentfrom 10-gp to 16p with a grant percentage of 59.3$ (an extra  69m KIt would also be possible to combine an increase in grant benefitingall ratepayers with an increase.se in domestic element.13.   All estimates of poundages are crude averages that cover a wide range (from 57p to 137p in 1972).    Moreover, the effects of revaluationon individual ratepayers may vary considerably.    H ever the less, if ministers were to increase the rate of grant on the lines suggested above, it i^ould be possible for them to argue that by and large theywere ensuring that rate burdens should not increase by more than the agreed guidelines, and for them to bring pressure to bear on localauthorities to hold down their rate demands accordingly.1lx.    Ministers may also wish to note that a rate support grantsettlement for Scotland is also due to be made later this year andany decision taken in regard to England and Wal&amp;s will have implications for that.    Moreover, the settlement for Scotland will cover 1971+-75as well as 1973-7^1--Increase Orders15.   Rate support grant settlement are made oh the basis of the levels of prices, costs and remuneration then current and the grants aresubsequently adjusted by means of increase orders to maintain their value in real terms.    The Secretary of State for the Environment may(1) These figures do not take(para 9 above) which will further 1$.into account the effect of revaluationincrease domestic rate burdens by ak.
make an increase order if he considers that increases in pay and prices have been substantial but having decided to make an order-he has no discretion over the increases in pay and prices which are taken into account.    Increase orders are normally made every year.16.,    Information is still being collected about the pay and price-increases since the last increase orders were made in November 1971.First estimates of those affecting the tail end of year 1971-72amount to about  .33m but these may x^ell increase by  10m or so;for 1972/73 they may amount to about  3 0m.    The ultimate total tobe taken into account by an. order this year will depend upon what further pay settlements are announced before the order goes to printin November.   An increase order does not add to public expenditure -it merely determines the extent to which the costs of expenditurealready incurred are borne by rates or by other taxes.    If an Order-were not made, the loss would have to be made good by increasedrating next year, and this would clearly be inconsistent with any action taken to keep rate levels down by increasing grant.

THE RATE SUPPORT GRANT SYSTEMRate Support Grant (ESG-) is a general grant in aid of all localauthority rate-fund expenditure.    It is not related to individualservice or projects.    Over 80$ of all Exchequer aid to localauthorities is paid through ISO, the remainder being specific grantsrelated to expenditure on pa.rticul.ar activities.2.   The total amount of grant to be paid to ail authorities is determined in advance by the Secretax*y of State for the Environmentin an Order (subject to affirmative reso3.ution).    In making an Order,the Secretary of State is required to take into account the latestavailable information on the relevant expenditure (see para. 6 below)of local authorities, any probable fluctuation in the demand for servicesdue to circumstances not under the control of local authorities(eg population increase) and the need for developing those serviceshaving regard to general economic conditions.3.   He is also required to consult the local authorities associations and G-LG, and for this purpose a series of working groups of officials and local authority officers has been set up to consider the relevant expenditure on each service in detail and to try to forecast ex-penditure in later years on the assumption that existing policies arecontinued.    The reports of these groups form the starting point forthe main negotiations, which consider the extent to which the assump-tions made on the reports are valid, and whether additional growthor decline in provision of services should be allowed for.k.   Having decided on a forecast of relevant expenditure, theSecretary of State has then to decide on the amount of grant to be paid.Although the statute lays down no criteria for this,  the practice hasbeen to keep the grant at a fixed percentage of forecast expenditure,except for a small increase (1$ or ^% p.a.) to allow for increasedrelief to domestic ratepayers  (see para. 8(iii) below).    Thus the -forecast of relevant expenditure has hitherto effectively determined the rate of grant s .    Once an Order has been ma.de, it cannot be varied (except forinflation - see para. 7 below).    Thus authorities know in advance theamount of grant they are to receive, and since the detailed forecasts are published, they are avjare of the policy implications of the grantsettlement.    But each authority is fi*ee to decide its own level ofexpenditure for itself and there is no way of ensuring that the sumtotal of these decisions will correspond to the national forecast.In practice the outturn is usually within 1$ of the forecast but thisdepends on the forecasts being realistic.   Arbitrary cuts not related to policy decisions are usually ineffective.Relevant Expend!ture6.    For purpose of rate support grant, relevant expenditure is defined as the total expenditure falling on the rate fund of an authority(other than payments to another authority under precept), but ex-cluding contributions to Housing Revenue Accounts and to tradingaccounts.    It differs from the total of local authorities&apos; rateestimates because of these exclusions, because it takes no account ofthe rise and fall in working balance and because it is forecast on a.
constant prico basis whereas r-ate estimates have to allow forinflation.   And it differs from the Public Expenditure Survey fore-casts of local authority current expenditure because it includesinterest on debt and the use of revenue for capital purposes (which appear under other programmes in the PESO report) and debt repayments(which are not treated as public expenditure).Increase Orders7,   All grant negotiations take place on the basis of the latestavailable prices, costs and remuneration (for this year as at30 June 1972) and the forecasts of expenditure assume no change inthese levels.    The figures are revised before the resulting Order-is made in November to take account of any Increases since Juneincluding foreseeable increases; thereafter, the Secretax*y of state has povjer to make an Increase Order to take account of any increasein levels of prices, costs and remuneration since the main Order wasmade.    Such Increase Orders are usually made annually and rely to aconsiderable extent on information collected by the associations fromtheir members.    Having decided to make an Order, the Secretary ofState is bound to take into account all increases.; he cannot choose to ignore certain items on the grounds that they are unreasonable.Distribution of Grant8,   The aggregate amount of grant is first reduced by the estimatedamount to be paid as specific grants (other than capital grants and housing subsidies).    The balance is distributed as rate support grant in three elements.(i) Needs element   (about Q0% of the total) paid to majorauthorities in accordance with a formula taking intoaccount their population, number of school children,old people, 2*oad mileage and other objective factors.The main principles of the formula are laid down in egislation or in regulations; but the values to beattached to some of the factors form part of the maingrant settlement.(ii) Resources element; paid to all authorities whose rateable value per head (&quot;after adjustment for areas of low density)is below the national average. The grant is a percentageof their a.ctual expenditure.(iii) Domestic element;    the Secretary of State may prescribethat rates on domestic properties shall be less thanthose on non-domestic by a fixed amount (currently 10-^p).The loss of income is made good to rating authorities bythe domestic element of grant.-2-
