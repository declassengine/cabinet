EXPLANAIOIT MEMORANDUM ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY BILLCHAPTER IINTRODUCTION1.   This Meaorandum explains the main provisions of the Social Security bill now before Parliament.   The Report by the Government Actuary (Cmnd        )deals with the Bill&apos;s financial provisions.2.   In September 1971 the Government published their proposals for the futured development of State and occupational pensions in the White Paper&quot;Strategy for Pensions&quot; (Cmnd 4755).   They indicated that they would welcomeconstructive criticisa from any source and that they would be consulting a wide range of organisations representing employers, employees and the occupational pensions movement on the details of the proposals.   In framing the more detailed proposals now put forward in this Bill the Government havetaken account of the many helpful comments which have been made.3.   The original proposals for the basic scheme have been altered in one important respect.   Paragraphs 32 and 33 of &quot;Strategy for Pensions&quot; referred tobiennial reviews of basic scheme pensions and related benefits.   In December1971 the Secretary of State for Social Services announced that henceforth suchreviews would take place annually and that this improvement would be embodied in due course in the Bill to implement the pension proposals.   The Bill containsprovisions to fulfil this undertaking.4.   Another important departure from what was proposed in the White Paperconcerns the conditions which occupational pension schemes must satisfy if their members are to be treated as in &quot;recognised&quot; pensionable employment and so notliable for contributions under the reserve pension scheme.   The Bill enablesalternatives to be provided to the standard test which was outlined in paragraphs57 to 59 of &quot;Strategy for Pensions&quot;.   These alternatives, without prejudicing the standards on which recognition is to depend, will be particularly suited to the structure of final salary and money-purchase schemes.5.   The main changes the Bill makes in existing arrangements are:-(l) wholly earnings-related contributions for employed earners insteadof the prasent hybrid structure of flat-rate and graduated contributions;(2)   earnings-delated contributions for self-employed earners with earnings above a certain level, in addition to theirweekly flat-rate contributions;
(3)   voluntary contributions for people who would otherwise be unableto fualify for basic pensions and some other benefits;(2f)   qualifying tests for basic scheme benefits based on the newcontribution system;, .   statutory(5)  /annual reviews of basio scheme contributions and benefits;(6)   the winding up of the existing State graduated pension scheme;(7)    recognition   of occupational schemes .for the purpose of exemption from the reserve pension scheme;(8)   preservation of occupational pension rights on change of employment;(9)   an independent Occupational Pensions Board to administer the new arrangements affecting occupational pension schemes;(10)   a reserve pension scheme managed by an independent Board toprovide earnings-related pensions for employees not covered byrecognised occupational schemes.6.   The Bill largely replaces the existing national insurance legislation butit re-enacts many provisions of the existing scheme.   The Bill includes the changes necessary to adapt short-term benefits to the new system of basic schemecontributions   but the Government are considering whether further changes inthese benefits are desirable.   Only minor changes are made to the industrial injuries legislation.   The industrial injuries contribution will become an integral part of the new contribution structure   and as a result the industrial injuries Fund is being merged with the National Insurance Fund.   The benefitspayable under the industrial injuries scheme will be unchanged.7.Appendix A contains tables illustrating,as at October 1972, the contributions which would be payable under the new scheme at various earnings levels compared with those payable under the present scheme.   The rates of benefit under the basic scheme, which are set out inAppendix B, are those which took effect in October 1972.2.restricted
CHAPTER IIBASIC SCHEMEContributions8.   The basic scheme will be financed, as at present, on a pay-as-you-go basis which means that the contributions payable by the present working population are determined by the current cost of pensions and other benefits.   The basicscheme will also receive a Treasury supplement equal to 18 per cent of its contribution income.   A small part of the total contributions will consist ofcontributions towards the cost of the national health service plus employers&apos;contributions to the Redundancy Fund (see paragraph 9).9.   Basic scheme contributions will be of the following four classes, thefigures given being related to current earnings levels:-Class 1   Primary cgntributions will be payable, subject to any prescribedexceptions, by all employees and office-holders other than those earningless than  8 a week.   The rate will be 5.25 per cent on all earnings up toA-8 a week.   Married women and those widows who have a choice under thepresent scheme will be able to elect to pay at the reduced rate of 0.6 percent, covering industrial injuries benefits and a contribution to thenational health service.   An election^^oj\change of election, will relateuef!/) rct^] *0 complete income tax years.   Secondary corijbributions will be payable by employers and by the appropriate authority in the case of office-holders.The rate will be 7.5 per cent (including a contribution of 0.2   per cent to the Redundancy Fund) over the same range of earnings as primarycontributions.   Class 1 contributions will be collected through PAYE,thus dispensing with contribution cards for employed earners.Class 2   These contributions will be payable by self-employed people ata standard rate ( 1.68 a week) but at the start of the scheme there willbe a lower rate for women.   It is intended that this lower rate shouldcorrespond to the rate obtaining in the existing scheme at the time whenthe new scheme begins;   it will be brought into line with the new standard rate over a period of five years,    (in terms of current earnings levels thelower contribution would be  1.40, the present woman&apos;s rate.)   Self-employed people with earnings below a specified level (in current terms 468 a year) may apply for exception.   Married women and those widowswho have a choice under the present scheme will be entitled to choosewhether or not to pay Class 2 contributions.   Any such election, or changeof eleotion, will relate to complete tax years.DCCTRIf^fir*FDl\C9 I nivixu
Clage 3   These contributions will be payable voluntarily by people who would otherwise be unable to qualify for basic scheme pension and certain other benefits, because they have an insufficient record of Clase 1 or Class 2 contributions.   The standard rate of contribu-tions will be  1.33.   Married women and widows who have elected notto pay Class 1 (full rate) or Class 2 contributions will not be eligible to pay Class 3 contributions.TClass 4   These contributions will be payable on profits or gains froma trade, business or vocation assessable to tax under Case I orCase II of Schedule D.   Contributions will be at the rate of 5 per cent of such profits or gains between  1150 and  2500, and will be payablewith any Schedule D tax due.   These contributions are intended to ensurethat the self-employed make a fair contribution to the basic schemecompared with the employed.10.   Generally speaking, Class 1 contributions will be paid by Schedule Etaxpayers and Class 2 and 4 contributions by those assessable to tax under shedule D, but there are powers in the Bill to alter the class of contributionpayable by particular groups.   Examples of contributions payable under theBill by employed and self-employed earners are given in Appendix A.   Wheresomeone is concurrently engaged in more than one employment, or is both employed and self-employed,his total liability will be limited and any contributions paidin excess of a prescribed annual limit will be refunded.11.   From the start of the new scheme everyone will have the same contributionyear which will be the tax year.   This will lead to a common benefityear for short-term benefits, such as sickness and unemployment benefit,beginning in the January following the end of the relevant tax year.Benefits12.   The Bill provides for benefits similar to those under the presentlegislation.   Title to particular benefits will continue to depend on particular classes of contribution;   the classes relevant to each particularbenefit are set out in Clause1.0 of the Bill.it-.restricted
Contribution conditions for benefit13.   The change to a fully earnings-related system of contributions for employed earners means that it will no longer be possible to base the contribution conditions for benefit on the number of weekly contributions paid in a contribution year or throughout a working life.   The Billestablishes a new system of contribution conditions related to yearly levels of earnings on which contributions have been paid.   Under the new arrangements the various contribution conditions are expressed as multiplesof the level of earnings -  8 a week in current terms - at which the employedearner will be liable to pay contributions.   In general, the minimum annuallevel of earnings required for entitlement to the standard flat-rate benefitswill be 50 times this lower earnings limit ie  400 in current terms,14.   For this purpose the amount of contributions paid by an employed earnerin a tax year will be converted to an &quot;earnings factor&quot; corresponding tothe amount of earnings on which   he   has   paid contributions.   For the greatmajority of employed earners whose weekly earnings lie between the lower andupper earnings limits of the scheme this earnings factor will correspond withtheir actual earnings.   But for those who have earnings outside these limits the use of the earnings factor will secure that only earnings on whichcontributions have been paid will count for benefits.   Flat-rate Class 2contributions paid by self-employed earners and voluntary Class 3contributions will be given an earnings value corresponding to the lowerearnings limit.   This will make it possible to express a mixed record ofcontributions in terms of a single earnings factor where the benefitconcerned is covered by more than one class of contribution.15.   As in the present scheme there are two contribution conditions foreach of the main benefits - a first test of contributions actually paidin any one tax year and a second test of contributions paid or credited ina particular year or number of years.   Appendix C shows in summary formthe proposed contribution conditions for different benefits.5.
Unemployment and Sickness Benefits16.   The provisions in the Bill for unemployment and sickness benefits retain the present structure of these benefits but changes have been made to adaptit to the new system of earnings-related contributions.   Both unemployment ancsickness benefits will as now consist of two parts, a flat-rate element andan earnings-related supplement.   The flat-rate element will be subjectto two contribution tests (see Appendix C) and the earnings-related supplement will be governed by the claimant&apos;s recentearnings:   broadly those on which Class 1 contributions were paid in the relevant tax year.Invalidity Benefit17.   An invalidity pension will be payable after a person has been entitled to sickness benefit for 28 weeks in a period of interruption of employment (that is in a period in which spells of incapacity orunemployment are not separated by more than 13 weeks).   There will be nofurther contribution condition to be satisfied, ie there will be no equivalent of the present condition which requires the payment of 156 contributions.There will continue to be an invalidity allowance for persons who were morethan five years below the minimum age for retirement pension when they fellsick, and the allowance will continue to be payable after pensionable age,with retirement pension.Attendance Allowanoe18.   The higher rate of attendance allowance, for those people so severelydisabled that they require frequent attention or constant supervisionthroughout the day and night, has been in payment since December 1971.   TheNational Insurance Act 1972 introduced a lower rate for those who requiresuch attention during either the day or night.   The Bill makes no changes inthese conditions and as at present there will be no contribution conditions.Maternity Benefit[fiwfc&quot; 2 jdjg -      Maternity Grant&amp;dw)]) 19.   A lump sum maternity grant will be payable on the contribution record ofthe claimant or her husband on the same basis as at present, subject to the satisfaction of the contribution tests described in Appendix C.ivffc &quot;      Maternity Allowance^ I.r.a.-ot] 20,   The Bill provides for a maternity allowanoe to be payable on the basis ofa woman1s own contributions as at present but the contribution conditions willbe based on tax years as for sickness benefit.   In future maternityallowance will also attract earnings-related supplement directly instead of
Restrictedentitlement to the supplement being derived from an underlying title to sickness benefit   as at present.   The remaining rules for payment of the allowance will be unchanged.Widow, s Benefit21.   The benefits for widows provided under the Bill are basically the sameas now.   The widows allowance (which is payable during the first six months    3of widowhood) will however be subject to only onecontribution test   (see Appendix C);   there will be no equivalent of thepresent second condition, which relates the rate of the allowance to theneed foryearly average of contributions, and thus there will be no Reduced rates ofthe allowance.   The widow&apos;s supplementary allowance, which is governed by theamount of the late husband&apos;s recent earnings (broadly those on which Class 1contributions were paid in the relevant tax year) will be re-named &quot;widow earnings-related addition&quot; to avoid confusion with supplementary allowancespaid under the Ministry of Social Security Act 1966, but will otherwise remain unchanged.   Similarly, widowed mother&apos;s allowance and widows pension will beunchanged except that the contribution conditions, which will continue to bebasically the same as those for retirement pension (see paragraph 24), willbe adapted to the new contribution structure in the same way as the conditions for that pension.Guardian&apos;a Allowance22.   A guardian&apos;s allowance will be paid in circumstances similar to those inwhich it is paid at present.   There will be no contribution conditions butregulations may prescribe other conditions eg as to residence or nationality.Retirement Pensions _____23.   The Bill puts retirement pensions into four categories, A, B, C and Dwhich, as shown below, are equivalent to those in the present scheme.   the contribution conditions for category A and B pensions are set out inAppendix C.   There are no contributions conditions for category C or D&quot;a -l. \     -j-       pensions. ,I. hybr o rvAtsTiilico Category A pension24.   This is the pension payable on a person&apos;s own contributions on retirementfrom regular employment at or after the pensionable age of 65 (60 for a woman)or at the age of 70 ( 65 for a woman) whether or not he had then retired.If retirement is deferred during this period of five years the rate of pension,when it is finally awarded, will be increased by one-eighth of one per centin which for each week of deferment except those /certain other benefits from public funds are drawn.   A married woman&apos;s title to a category A pension will depend, as now,
additionalupon the satisfaction of   an /    test - that she has reached the requiredminimum level of contributions in at least half the tax years of her marriedlife.   This test will not apply to women who marry on or after their 55th jbirthday.?&apos;This\rJk -Oatol        Category B pension25. This is the pension payable to a woman on her husband&apos;s contributions oncehe has qualified for his own category A pension and she has reached pensionable age and retired or has reached 65.   It is also payable on widowhood after60 whether or not the latshusband had retired and qualified for his own pension.Where a husband defers his retirment, his wife&apos;s category B pension will beincreased for each week of deferment after she is 60 by half the weeklyincrease which he earns for his own pension.   The addition payable to her will,as now, be increased in the event of his death.U;f* v^-A^A Category C pension26.   This is the pension (introduced in November 1970) which is payable to aperson who was over pensionable age on 5 July 1948 (when the present schemestarted), and to a woman whose husband is so entitled, provided she is overpensionable age and has retired from regular employment.   The Bill includes the present power for regulations to provide pensions for the widows of menwho were over pensionable age on 5 July 1948.95^5227 2 ESnsion27.   This is the pension (introduced in September 1971) payable to personsover 80 who are not entitled to any other category of pension, or who areentitled to some other category of pension but at a rate which is less thanthat of a category D pension.ittr^rX -AJtci]       Age addition28.   Anyone who is over 80 and is entitled to any of the four categories ofpension will also be entitled to an age addition.Child1s Special Allowance29.   A child&apos;8 special allowance will, as now, be paid for the child orohildren of a divorced woman who3e former husband dies while maintaining them,or while liable to maintain them.There will be only one contributioncondition (see Appendix C)j   there will be no equivalent of the present condition which requires a yearly average of 50 contributions.
death grant30.   there will he only one contribution condition   (see appendix c) in placeof the present two, and thus there will be no need for reduced rates of thegrant.   there will however still be a lower rate in respect of people whowere already within ten years of reaching pensionable age on 5 july 1948,and lower rates for those under 18.benefits for dependants31.   as at present, benefits will be increased where a beneficiary has a wifeor other adult dependant or children either living with him or maintained by him.PnnJkrV,      - lajjf   reviews of contributions and benefit-annual reviews32.   in accordance with the governmenfs policy that the rates of retirement pensions and related benefits will be reviewed annually, the bill placescertain obligations upon the secretary of state in relation to bothcontributions and benefits.FkArl r&amp; - contributions33*   eaoh year there will be a review of the contributionprovisions of the bill by reference to general levels of earnings prevailing at the time and to any other matters that appear relevant.   as a consequenceof the review, certain contribution levels and rates (the lower and upperearnings limits for class 1 contributions, the rates of class 2 and class 3contributions, the amount of earnings below which exception may be soughtfrom class 2 contributions and the earnings limits for class 4contributions .)may be amended by order from the beginning of thefollowing tax year.  if no amendments are to be madethe secretary of state will be required to submit to parliament a reportcontaining an explanation of why this is so.ifefcrX if^tt- - AJtco] benefits34,   a review of    benefit rates t will be carried out eachyear.   if the review shows that an increase is needed to maintain their value of the benefits the secretary of state will, subject to parliamentary approval, make an order to this effect.   alternatively, an order may.increase benefits by more than is necessary to maintain their
purchasing power if he considers this appropriate having regard to changesin the general level of earnings, the standard of living and the national economic situation,   iny increase in benefit rates will take effect in thelatter half of November,   If no increase is to be made, the Secretary ofState will be required to submit to Parliament a report containing an explanation of why this is so.   The benefits to be covered by an Order arethe flat rates of unemployment and sickness benefits and maternity andwidow&apos;s allowances, invalidity benefit, attendance allowance, widowed mother&apos;allowance and widow&apos;s pension, guardian&apos;s allowance, retirement pension(including increments for deferred retirement), age addition, and increases in respect of child and adult dependants.   Increases in maternity and deathgrants may be provided for in the Order,   The Bill makes provision also for increases in benefits of the industrial injuries scheme under the Order,Other contribution reviews35,   Quite apart from the annual reviews, the Secretary of State may at anytime amend by Order the percentages of Class 1 and Class 4 contributions (butonly within defined limits), and the rates of Class 2 and 3 contributionswith a view to adjusting the income of the National Insurance Fund to enable it to meet future expenditure.   Such an Order may also amend the amount of earnings below which exception may be obtained from liability for Class 2contributions.Credits36.   The Bill contains power for regulations to provide for contributions tobe credited to a contributor&apos;s record   so as to safeguard, future entitlement to benefit eg where people have been sick or unemployed.   Credits will also beused to assist new entrants into employment and certain other special groups.National Insurance Advisory Committee&quot; 37.   The National Insurance Advisory Committee will continue under the new scheme, but with an increased membership of between 6 and 10 in addition tothe Chairman.   Appointment to the Committee will be for a variable term offrom three to five years,   (At present the appointment is normally for a fixed term of five years).   Proposals for regulations will, with certain exceptions, be submitted to the Committee and the Secretary of state will be required to make a statement on the Committee&apos;s recommendations to Parliament^RWfcf o r^tt/-      Adjudication&apos;  ^&quot; &quot;^-^ 38.   The existing legislation concerning the determination of claims and questions is contained in Part IV of the National Insurance Act 1965, as
boll &quot;bp&quot;]boll -bp]amended.   This Part of the 1965 Act is not to be repealed because it isself-contained and requires only minor changes to adapt it to the new arrangements.   Any question relating to the amount of profit for the purposeof Class 4 contributions will be determined under the income tax appealprocedures.Finance39.   There will be one Fund for the national insurance and industrial injuries schemes, instead of three as at present: the Industrial InjuriesFund and the National Insurance (Reserve) Fund will be merged with theNational Insurance Fund.   The contributions to the National Insurance ?undare described in paragraphs 8-11.   As mentioned there, the Fund will receive a Treasury supplement equal to 18 per cent of its income from contributions.40.   Estimates of the income and outgo of the Fund as the scheme developsare given in the Report by the Government Actuary (Cmnd        ) on the financial provisions of the Bill, published concurrently with this Memorandum.Pwikr n       -       Transitional arrangements and Appointed Day(s)41.   The Bill makes provision for the transition from the existing schemeto the new one.   The arrangements will cover such matters as treating old-stylejflat-rate contributions as new-style earnings-related contributions and vice versa, and modified contribution tests for short-term benefits for the period immediately following the start of the new scheme.42.   The graduated pension scheme, and the arrangements under which persons are Contracted out of it, will be wound up.   Further graduated pension willnot be earned for periods after the new scheme has begun but existing rightswill be preserved.43,   The new scheme will start on a day, or days, appointed by the Secretaryof State; different days may be appointed for different provisions of the Bill.The target date for bringing the main structural changes into operation isApril 1975.
RKTRI MCTEDCHAPTER IIIOCCUPATIONAL SCHEMESOccupational Pensions Board44.   The Seoretary of State will appoint an independent Occupational PensionsBoard, consisting of a Chairman, Deputy Chairman, and 8 to 12 other members;one member will be appointed after consultation with organisations representativeof employers, and one after consultation with organisations representative of employees.    The Board will have the following functions:-fl)     to decide whether occupational pension arrangements meet therequirements for recognition so as to exempt those concerned fromcontributing to the reserve pension scheme;(2)     to supervise the arrangements for preserving the pension rights of early leavers;(5)     to assist occupational pension schemes to change their rules, if they need help in doing this, to adapt to the new situation resulting fromthe Bill;(4)    to advise the Secretary of State on matters relating to occupational pension schemes.45.   The Board will have power to review their decisions on application, or ontheir own initiative; and there will be a right of appeal on questions of law to the High Court (in Scotland, the Court of Session).   To the extent providedby regulations, the Board will be able to require people to give evidenceor produce documents relevant to the discharge of the Board&apos;s functions.   Theywill have available to them staff provided by the Secretary of State and, as necessary, will be able to call on expert advioe.12
Recognition of pensionable employment46.   Employment! covered by occupational sohemes whioh satisfy the conditionsoutlined in the following paragraphs may be &quot;recognised&quot; so that the employees and employers conoerned will be relieved of liability to contribute to the reserve pension scheme. The minimum benefitsrequired for recognition are referred to in the Bill as &quot;minimum personalpension&quot; and &quot;minimum death benefit&quot;.Conditions as to financial soundness47*   If a scheme is to qualify for recognition, the Occupational Pensions Boardmust be satisfied as to the scheme&apos;s finanoial arrangements on two counts:first, that its resources (that is, its funds from contributions and investmentincome, or its insurance baoking) will be sufficient to cover the scheme&apos;future liabilities for the minimum benefits required for recognition; and secondly that in the event of discontinuance the scheme&apos;s rules accord priority to, and its resources will be sufficient to meet its liabilities for, pensions in payment, accrued minimum benefits (including certain credits by transfer)and &quot;equivalent pension benefits&quot; provided under the present contracting-outarrangements.   In the absence of suoh a priority rule the Board will have tobe satisfied that the resources would be sufficient to meet all the scheme&apos;sliabilities on discontinuance.   Public servioe sohemes will not need tosatisfy these tests since they are baoked by public funds.i48.   Where in the opinion of the Board a funding deficiency exists, the Boardmay make it a condition of continuing recognition that the deficiency ismade good over 3uch period as they direct.   The Board will continue toexercise surveillanoe over a soheme&apos;s finanoial arrangements during the currency of a recognition certificate.   If recognition is withdrawn thissurveillanoe will continue so long as employees remain entitled to minimumbenefits under the scheme.   Where a scheme has oeased to.be rejcognised theso as to protect^the minimum benefits&apos;,Board will have power where necessary,/to enforce or amend the schemed rules,to direct the employer to make good any deficiency and^as a last resort^may order the scheme to be wound up.Minimum personal pension49.   To qualify for recognition, a scheme must provide a minimum level of personal retirement pension.   The standard test for this laid down in the Bill13restrk ted
HE^HiOTBDTEDrequires an annual pension to be provided representing at least 1 per cent(0.7 per cent for women) of a person1s reokonable earnings (that is earningson which Class 1 contributions under the basic scheme are payable) throughoutthe whole period of reoognised pensionable employment, where the schemeprovides for periodic increases in pensions after pensionable age (seeparagraph 53).   Where provision is not made for increasing pensions in paymentthe minimum personal pension under the standard test must be at least.25 per cent (0.9 per cent for women) of reckonable earnings.50.   In addition there will be power to make regulations prescribingalternatives to the standard test in the case of certain types of scheme -those commonly known as &quot;money purchase&quot; schemes and &quot;final salary&quot; schemes,and also those which provide benefits on death after retirement bycompulsory allocation from the husband retirement pension.51.   In the case of money purchase schemes, the Bill requires an overallcontribution of at least 5 per cent of a person&apos;s reckonable earnings, withthe employer paying at least 2.5 per cent.   Apart from that the details ofthe various alternative tests will be contained in regulations.   Some of thedetails have still to be settled after further consultations but the intention is to provide tests comparable to the standard test, but more suited to the structure of the scheme in question.52.   Thus it is likely that a money purchase scheme will have to set out in a table the benefits guaranteed in return for a specified level of contributionsat each age, in much the same way as the reserve pension scheme will.   Theintention is that these benefits should be not less than the guaranteed benefitsset out in the Bill for the reserve pension scheme.   Final salary schemesoalculate pensions as a given percentage of final salary for each year ofservice.   The alternative test for such schemes will lay down what the minimumpercentage or percentages should be.   More than one percentage may be prescribed, so as to provide not only a suitable level for those schemes whichundertake to increase deferred pensions up to the date of payment, but alsoa higher level in respect of each of the first few years of service for those schemes which do not give pre-award increases and would otherwise not14restricted
adequately protect employees with short service.53.   Recognised schemes whioh increase pensions in payment may do so by givingincreases which are in line with movements in the cost of living; or whiohamount to at least 3 per oent per annum compound; or whioh, although not atthat pre-determined rate, are to be given on a basis which the occupational pensions Board regards as providing comparable protection against loss of purchasing power.the54.   The minimum personal pension must be payable from not later thai/pensionable age    of   the basic scheme (65 for men, 60 for women) unless retirement fromthe relevant employment is deferred beyond that date.   If retirement isdeferred, the minimum pension in schemes providing for post-retirementincreases will have to take account, when it is finally put into payment, ofany increases that would have been given had it been payable from pensionable age.Minimum death benefit55.   The minimum death benefit required for recognition will generally be payable to the man&apos;s widow, though schemes will be permitted to pay the benefitat the discretion of the trustees to a dependant or dependants other than the widow.   Benefit will not be required, however, where the man dies leaving nowidow, nor where he marries after his period of recognised pensionableemployment has ended or after pensionable age.   Schemes may also, if they wish,exclude from minimum death benefit cover members who will on the appointed daybe within 5 years of the scheme&apos;s pensionable age.56.   Where a man dies after reaching pensionable age the minimum death benefitmust be paid in the form of a pension, generally of at least half the man&apos;sminimum personal pension.   Where he dies before pensionable age schemes willalternatively be permitted to provide death benefit in the form of a lump sum;this will have to be either approximately equivalent in value to the deathbenefit in pension form that would otherwise have been payable (ie 14 or 11times the annual rate of that pension depending on whether or not it would havebeen increased once in payment) or not less than 1-g- times the annual rate ofthe man*s reckonable earnings over a prescribed period before his death.Regulations may prescribe further methods of oaloulating death benefit for those schemes using one of the alternative tests for personal pension referred15RESTRICTED
iffis*W*WTEDto in paragraph 50.   Sobs reduction in the level of minimum death benefit willbe permitted where the nan was *ore than a specified number of years older thanhis wife or other dependant.Preservation and transfer of minimum benefits57.   Where an employee leaves a.reoognised pensionable employment after lessthan five years service a reserve scheme premium, equal to the total reserve scheme contributions which would have been payable had the employment not been recognised, must be paid to the reserve pension scheme unless minimum benefits under the occupational scheme are paxd or preserved/fer a transfer is made to another scheme covered by a recognition certificate.   Where a period of service in a recognised schemeexceeds five years, the minimum personal pension will have to be paid orpreserved.   Any contingent minimum death benefit will also have to be preservedin these circumstances and paid on death either before or after retirement.The methods of preserving minimum benefits will be controlled throughregulations.   Employees will be able to choose to accept a transfer paymentinstead of minimum benefits, but only if it is to another recognised scheme or to another (eg overseas) scheme which although not recognised satisfiesprescribed conditions.   Although no conditions will be laid down as to thevalue of the benefit rights to be awarded by the second scheme in return forthe transfer payment, they will have to be funded as though they were minimumbenefits, and, as under the general preservation requirements, the twoemployments will be aggregated in determining whether, on any subsequenttermination, both the benefit rights awarded in return for a transfer payment and minimum benefit accrued during the second employment must be preserved.Regulations may also provide that the benefit rights awarded on transfer fromone reoognised scheme to another must, where appropriate, include some deathbenefit, as well as,some personal benefit in pension form.Friendly Societies58.   Provision will be made to enable friendly societiesspecially approved for this purpose by the Chief Registrar of friendly societies to run occupational schemes used for recognition purposes.Notification to employees59.   Power is taken to require employers to notify their employees of their decision either to seek recognition or to rely on the reserve pension scheme.
bsld &quot;txjp&quot;     Preservation of occuc.ratio.nal pensions60.   The Bill lays down &quot;preservation requirements&quot; to protect the benefits ofmembers who leave their employment before normal pension age; to qualify for thisprotection the member must have attained the-age of &apos;26 and have completed5 years&apos; pensionable service.   The usual form of protection will be entitlement to a deferred pension, or a deferred annuity under the scheme s ordinaryarrangements for paying pensions.   Alternatively schemes will be able (if the member.; agrees)- to make a transfer payment to another scheme or to make some otherarrangement which broadly has the effect of maintaining pension cover.Pensionable service both before and after the appointed day will counttowards entitlement to a deferred pension, but employees in contributoryschemes may be offered a refund of their own contributions instead of a deferredpension in respect of their service before the appointed day, and in respectof any service after the appointed day lasting less than 5 years; in other cases,a contribution refund will not be permitted as an alternative to a deferredpension.61 .   It will be for the Occupational Pensions Board to decide whether the rules of a particular scheme conform to the requirements outlined in the Bill, andscheme administrators, employers and members will be able to apply to theBoard for this purpose.   The Board will also be able to make such a decisionon their own initiative when, for example, a scheme is brought to their notice on an application for recognition.   If a scheme does not conform the board will be able, as a last resort, directly to modify the scheme,62.   The benefits to be preserved will be those to which a member would havean enforceable right under the rules of his scheme if he stayed till normalpension age - they will include personal benefits and benefits payable on deathafter retirement.   Schemes which confer no enforceable right to benefits willbe outside the scope of the legislation.   In the case of the armed forces schemes(where this exclusion applies) the Government will ensure that the rules follow the principles of the legislation, although in view of their unique conditionsof employment the armed forces will need to retain powers to abate or suspendor apply forfeiture to pensions in appropriate cases.   scheme?s within the scopeof the legislation will be permitted to provide for forfeiture only in strictly limited circumstances.63.   The deferred benefits to be provided will be a proportion of the benefits the member would have received had he stayed in the employment until normalpension age, and must come into payment at that age (or from theage of 60, if later).   In most cases the amount will be calculated byRESTRICTED
&apos;w VIapplying the scheme&apos;s own rules relating to full-term benefits, but in someschemes (eg where a fixed benefit unrelated to length of service or tocontributions is provided, or, where the scheme provides for a higher rate ofaccrual for older or longer serving members) it will be calculated on thebasis of &quot;uniform accrual&quot;, ie by comparing the length of the member sactual pensionable   service with his total potential pensionable service upto normal pension age, on the assumption that his benefits would haveaccrued at a uniform rate over the whole of that service.   Account will be Itaken of any pension credits the member has obtained, eg in respect of a transfer payment from another scheme, and also of any provisions in the occupational scheme giving legal entitlement to periodic increases in benefits (whether before or after pension age).Modification of occupational pension schemes64.   Many occupational pension schemes will have to modify their provisions,or will wish to do so, in the light of the provisions of the Bill, especially those relating to recognised pensionable employment   and the preservation ofpension rights.   Most schemes will be able to make the necessary modificationsunder their own &apos;alteration  procedures, but some may find that the necessary powers are lacking or that the modification process would involve someprocedural difficulty making it unduly protracted.    In such cases the occupational Pensions Board will be able, on application and subject to certain conditions and safeguards, to authorise the modification of a scheme (or them-selves to modify it).   The Board will be able to perform a similarmodification function to enable schemes to obtain approval for tax purposesfrom the Inland Revenue under the Finance Act 1 970; to make or accept transfer payments; to &quot;buy out&quot; preserved pensions by means of an insurance policy;or to take general account of the Bill and related legislation.Truck Acts, Shop Clubs Act&apos; and the rule against perpetuities65.   The Government are concerned that the operation of recognised occupational pension schemes should not be impeded by the effect of the Truck Acts (and similalegislation) or by the rule of law relating to perpetuities.   A study of the implications is being made so that, during the passage of the Bill, an amendment can be moved to ensure that nothing in the Truck Acts would prevent or make invalid the deduction of a person&apos;s contributions to a recognised scheme from his remuneration; and that such a scheme will not constitute a shop clubor thrift fund which is subject to the Shop Clubs Act.   It is intended alsothat the trusts establishing recognised schemes should be protected againstthe rule of law relating to perpetuities.
CHAPTER IVIRESERVE PENSION SCHEMEGeneral outline66*   The reserve pension scheme will provide pensions for those employees notin recognised pensionable employment.   It will be entirely separate from the basic scheme and run by an independent Board on the lines of an occupational pension scheme.   There will be no Government subsidy.   Benefits will be   assessed by reference to the contributions paid,on a &apos;value for money&apos; basis, so that each contributor receives a fair return however short or long the period forwhich he and his employer have contributed.   The self-employed will not beincluded in the scheme.Contributions67,   Reserve scheme contributions will be earnings-related and set at 4 per cent of the same range of earnings as will apply for the basic scheme;   the employeewill pay 1-5per cent and the employer 2,5per cent.   The employee1s owncontribution has been fixed at less than half the total contribution to take account of the absence of tax relief on his share.   Contributions will be payable for any period when an employed earner is not in recognised pensionableemployment after the end of the tax year in which he reaches age 21and before the beginning of the tax year in which he reaches age 65(60 in the case of a woman).   There will be no provision for married women and windows to opt out of the scheme;   they will pay contributions and earn benefits on the same basis as other members of the scheme.   The Secretary of State willbe responsible for assessment and collection of reserve scheme contributions(and reserve scheme premiums, see paragraph 57) which, like basis schemecontributions, will be collected through PAYE.   Examples of reserve schemecontributions are given in Appendix D.Benefits68.   The reserve pension scheme will provide personal and widows&apos; pensions.   the widow&apos;s pension will be at half the rate of the late husband&apos;s pension or, ifhe dies before pension age, half the rate of the prospective pension secured bythe contributions paid up to the time of his death.   There will be no retirementcondition or earnings rule, and personal pensions will be paid at 65 for a man and 60 for a woman.19
resJS&amp;5rT:EtedMir a rA- -69,    Reserve pensions will consist of two elements, a guaranteed rate and a profit-sharing element which will take the form of bonus additions.   the guaranteed rates, which are set out in detail in Schedule igto the Bill, haveregard to the amount of.^contributions paid, the sex of the contributor and thecontributions &apos;age at the time the/ are paid. They have been calculated on conservativeassumptions as to the return which will be obtained from the investment of thecontributions.   Women&apos;s pension rates are lower than men&apos;s because women will receive their pensions earlier and on average live longer.   Youngercontributors receive a higher return because contributions paid early in lifeearn interest for a longer period.   Examples of reserve pensions are given inAppendix E.70,   Bonus additions to the guaranteed rates of pension will depend on the investment performance of the Reserve Pension Fund.   It is to be expected thatprofits will be revealed at the regular actuarial valuations of the scheme.The Reserve Pension Board, on each occasion they receive a report from theGovernment Actuary, will be under a duty to consider and decide whether a bonusshould be declared.   Bonuses will be expressed as a percentage increase ofpensions (including widows1 pensions) in payment, and, for contributors underpension age, as a percentage increase of prospective pension.   Normally, bonusesresulting from an actuarial review will be declared at three-yearly intervals,but the Board will also be able, without having an actuarial report, to declareinterim bonuses which will be applied to pensions in payment and to pensionsbecoming payable before the next actuarial review.   Interim bonuses will be incorporated in the next bonus declaration related to an actuarial review.71*    Reserve pensions will normally be payable for life (but widow&apos;s pensionwillcease on re-marriage).   Regulations will provide for small amounts ofpension to be commuted.Reserve Pension Fund72^   The reserve pension scheme will be fully funded and financed solely fromthe contributions paid by employed earners and their employers and the income from its investments.   The Reserve Pension Fund will not be available forGovernment use and will be entirely separate from the National Insuranoe Fund.The Fund will bear the full cost of reserve pensions and administration,including all expenses of the Reserve Pension Board in carrying out their functions,20
Reserve Pension Beard73.   Responsibility fer running the reserve pension scheme will be placed inthe hands of an independent Board which will be under a statutory duty to operate the scheme and conduct its investments so as to secure the best pensions for its members.   The Board will to that end have complete freedom of investment- including holdings in equities and property - subject only to the safeguardper centthat its holdings in any public company must be limited to less than 10/ of theunrestricted voting capital of that company.   The Board will also have the function of advising the Secretary of State on any matter relating to thereserve pension scheme that he may refer to them.74.    The Board will consist of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and 6 to 12 othermembers.   All members of the Board, including theChairman and Deputy Chairman, will be appointed by the Secretary of State whowill be under a duty to satisfy himself, before making any appointment, thatthe person concerned has no financial or other interest likely to affectprejudicially the performance of his functions as a member.   The Secretary ofState will be required to appoint one member after consulting organisationsrepresentative of employers and one member after consulting organisationsrepresentative of employees.General provisions75*    Questions as to entitlement to a reserve pension will be for decision bythe Reserve Pension Board with a right of appeal to the High Court (the Courtof Session ,in Scotland) on any question of law.   The Board will be able to review their own decisions. Reserve scheme contribution questions and questions common to both the reserve and the basic schemes (eg a person&apos;sage) will be for decision by the basic scheme adjudicating authorities with similar rights of appeal and review.Accounts and reports76.    The Government Actuary will be required at three-yearly intervals, oron a request from the Board, to make an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the Fund and to report to the Board on the operationof the scheme and the financial condition of the Fund.77*  The Board will be required to prepare an annual statement of accountn whichwill be subject to audit by commercial auditors appointed by the Secretary ofState.78. The Board will also be required to make an annual report,whioh will include astatement relating to their investment holdings, to the Secretary of State as21RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDsoon at practicable after the end of the accounting year.   This report is tobe accompanied by copies of the statement of accounts for that year, theauditors&apos; report and a report of any review made by the Government Actuary not already submitted to the Secretary of State in connection with bonus declarations.79*   The Secretary of State will be required to lay before Parliament copies ofthe Boards report, the statement of accounts, the auditors&apos; report, theGovernment Actuary&apos;s report and particulars of any decision by the 3oard relatingto a declaration or non-declaration of bonus.

BASIC SCfflBB COmilWTON CONDITIONS FOR BENEFITThere are two contribution conditions for most of the benefits of the basicscheme.   The first is a test of contributions actually paid in any one taxyear since age 16, and unless this test is satisfied no benefit is payable.The second is a test of contributions paid or oredited* in a particular year(for short-term benefits) or throughout working life (for long-term benefits)in order to qualify for the standard rate of benefit.   Generally speakingbenefit is payable at reduced rates where this second oondition is only partlysatisfied.Short-term benefits and grants the first contribution oondition for unemployment benefit, sickness benefit,year since age 16 must be not less than 25 times the lower earnings limit forthat year.The second contribution condition for these benefits is that the earningsfactor based on contributions paid or credited in the tax year relevant tothe claim for benefit must be not less than 50 (for maternity grant 25) times the lower earnings limit for that year.   These benefits (other than maternitygrant) are also payable at reduced rates where the second condition is onlypartly satisfied, subject to a minimum.   The first condition set out above will be the only condition for widows allowance and death grant.   the contribution conditions for sickness benefit are also in effect those forinvalidity benefit which follows automatically after 28 weeks of sickness benefit.Long-term benefits the first contribution condition for widowed mother&apos;s allowance, widow&apos;pension and category A and B retirement pensions is that the earnings factorbased on contributions actually paid in any one tax year since age 16 must benot less than 50 times the lower earnings limit for that year.The second contribution condition for these benefits is that for each ofnot less than 90 per cent of the tax years of working life the earningsfactor based on contributions paid or credited must be not less than 50 times the lower earnings limit.   These benefits are also payable at reduced rateswhere the second condition is only partly satisfied, subject to a minimum. Thefirst condition set out above will be the only condition for child&apos;s special**&apos;or an explanation of credits sRSSIW^TOlb 36.contributions of the appropriate class actually paid in any one tax
allowance. There are no contribution conditions for category (J or IJretirement pensions, attendance allowance or guardian&apos;s allowance.30
