S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT64CP(72) 108 COPY NO13 October 1972CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND: PAPER FOR DISCUSSIONNote by the Secretary of State for Northern ireland. My colleagues will know that I have for some time been engaged inextensive consultations with leaders of opinion in Northern Ireland,culminating in the Darlington Conference to which I invited representativesof each of the seven political Parties represented in the Northern IrelandHouse of Commons.    In the event the Conference was attended by only three of these Parties, but it nonetheless provided a helpful basis forexploring their views.    At the close of the Conference I announced thatit was my intention to publish a Green Paper on the future of NorthernIreland.    I attach a draft which I have called &quot;A Paper for Discussion&quot;,together with a draft foreword.2. While the paper avoids indicating any precise solution - many people in Northern Ireland would oppose what they took to be our intention,irrespective of its merits - it does rule out by implication solutions thatwould be unacceptable to us.    And to an objective reader, we may go someway towards suggesting the broad outline of a constitutional settlementmerely by stating the facts of the situation.   What is needed, I think, atthe present stage, is a description of the area within which a solution mustbe found.3. I need to publish the paper at latest on 30 October so as to avoidpressure during the Debate on the Address for a separate debate on NorthernIreland,    I hope to be able to publish a free popular version of the paper, inleaflet form, at the same time:  this is in preparation.W WNorthern Ireland Office13 October 1972
ForewordThe British Government have a clear objective in Northern Ireland.     It isto deliver its people from the violence and fear in which they live today and toset them free to realise their great potential to the full.We want to help them to draw together;   to find a system of government whichiwill enjoy the support and the respect of the overwhelming majority.     If it isto do so, such a system must emerge in large measure from the ideas and the convictionsof the Northern Ireland people themselves.     This is why there has to be a lengthyprocess of consultation, which I started on arrival, have been continuing ever since, most recently at the Darlington conference for Northern Ireland parties,and which I shall now seek to bring to fruition over the coming weeks.tiiBut the stage has now been reached at which we must take a step forward inshaping the future.     This is the purpose of this Paper for Discussion.     It doesnot set out any single cut and dried scheme for the future and sets out someifundamental conditions (including the clear pledges of successive British Governments);which any settlement must meet.       It places the Northern Ireland situation in the wider context of certain unalterable facts of life - political, economic andmilitary - which must fundamentally influence any settlement.iIt is our hope that this Paper will now provide a realistic basis for furtherjdiscussion which must be undertaken with a real sense of urgency.     what is at issue is the future of Northern Ireland, and I set out in the first paragraph -what the [Government aim to achieve for its people.     But the future of any community dependsiupon the will of its own people to live, to work and to make progress together.   This Ipaper seeks to provide, as its title and sub-title indicate, a basis for discussion as to how that may best be achieved.Secretary of State for Northern Ireland

X,    For more than fifty years, between 1921 and the enactment of the NorthernIreland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972,.Northern Ireland was governed underthe scheme of devolution embodied in the Government of Ireland Act 1920,,     that scheme remains today the basic constitutional document for Northern Ireland, sincethe Act of 1972 did not replace it, but rather superimposed upon it certaintemporary provisions, in particular the prorogation of the Northern ireland parliament and the assumption by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland ofthose executive powers hitherto discharged by the Government of Northern Ireland,2,    Annex I summarises the principal provisions of the Government of Ireland Act.1920 (hereafter referred to, for the sake of brevity, as &quot;the Act of 1920&quot;) asit case into force in Northern Ireland,     It is important to remember, however,that the Act was intended to establish a scheme of devolution not just for northern Ireland, but for Ireland as a whole.     In an attempt to reconcile the conflicting views of the majority in Ireland, who sought Home Rule, with those ofa minority, largely concentrated in the North, who wished to preserve theUnion with Great Britain, the United Kingdom Government introduced a compromise,providing for the establishment in Northern Ireland and in Southern Ireland of subordinate legislatures and governments within the United Kingdom, and also for specific machinery (the Council of Ireland) to promote co-operation and encourageultimate union within the United Kingdom by agreement.     In the event southern ireland did not operate the institutions established by the Act of 1920.     Thescheme of devolution for which that Act provided came into force in NorthernIreland alone, subject to such modifications as were made necessary by the subsequent changes in the status of the rest of Ireland;   and although the subsequent course of North-South relations (of which a summary is given in annex 2) did not preclude a degree of practical co-operation, the formal jointinstitutions envisaged by the Act of 1920 were stillborn.
J,     Although the Northern Ireland Parliament (subsequently to become widely knownas &quot;Stormont&quot; from its eventual location) was endowed with quite extensive law-making powers, it became apparent at art early date that the exercise of these powers in practice would be tempered by the realities of the financial situation,The Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland were from the outset in theanomalous position of having responsibility for a wide range of public expenditure without any comparable responsibility for raising the major part ofthe revenue to finance it, since those &quot;transferred&quot; taxes which the NorthernIreland Parliament had power to levy were at no time adequate to finance morethan a minor proportion of &quot;transferred&quot; expenditure.    The rates of those&quot;reserved&quot; (or Westminster controlled) taxes from which the greater part ofNorthern Ireland expenditure had to be met fluctuated in response to economic,financial and budgetary circumstances of the United Kingdom as a whole; henceNorthern Ireland was unable to engage in those aspects of economic managementwhich are central to the concerns of modern democratic governments,*f&quot;.     Cn the contrary, there steadily evolved a relationship based upon theprinciple of &quot;parity&quot;, by which citizens of the United Kingdom living in NorthernIreland paid the same taxes and enjoyed a similar standard of public sectorservices as their fellow-citizens in Great Britain, achieved by payments tothe Northern Ireland Exchequer, to Northern Ireland statutory funds (such asthe Northern Ireland National Insurance Fund), and direct to individual citizensin Northern Ireland.5,     Thus, as a part of the United Kingdom Northern Ireland has not been held backby inadequate tax resources from the development of services to standardsacceptable in Great Britain.   But the arrangements designed to secure this end haveinevitably meant that the ability of the Northern Ireland Parliament to create,by legislation, distinctive policies of its oWn, has been severely inhibited.    Inthe specific areas covered by the various &quot;parity&quot; agreements, the NorthernIreland Government bound itself of its own choice, and in order to secure sub-promotestantial benefits for the Northern Ireland community, tq/legislate virtually in
oarallel with Great Britain.    Nor was the effect of Northern Ireland&apos;s financialdependence confined to those areas covered by specific parity arrangements.Because public expenditure in Northern Ireland exceeded public revenue raisedthere, virtually all Northern Ireland&apos;s policies involving significant new expenditure had to be agreed in advance with HM Treasury; so that even in fieldswhere the distinctive traditions and needs of Northern Ireland led to the provisionof distinctive programmes and politicies, the Northern Ireland Parliaments freedomof legislative action was limited by the constraints of United Kingdom public expenditure.    In fields such as industrial development the need to take accountof additional factors such as international obligations and consequential effectsin Great Britain both for individual companies and particular regions meant that more detailed consultation with Whitehall was necessary.6.     The Northern Ireland Parliament has nevertheless enacted in many fieldslegislation specially adapted to the local situation.   For example, NorthernIreland legislation on industrial development at various times and in various ways provided for a level of inducement intended to offset as far as possibleNorthern Ireland&apos;s geographic and other disadvantages.    Specialised agenciesestablished by the Northern Ireland Parliament, such as the Northern IrelandTuberculosis Authority and the Northern Ireland Housing Trust, made a most sig-significant contribution towards the betterment of life in the Province.7.     Because the Northern Ireland Parliament lacked real economic or financial independence the area of its genuinely and wholly independent legislative action tended to be concentrated on the social and regulatory fields, on changesin distinctive codes of law, and on measures which were significant for other reasons than their expenditure implications.
3.     Of particular importance was that -wide area of public policy which may be described as &quot;law and order and security&quot;.   On the one hand the Northern ireland parliament&apos;s general grant of powers charged it with responsibility for peace and order, as well as for good government; on the other, the United kingdom parliament reserved to itself responsibility for the defence of the realm andfor the raising of any kind of military force.    In practice, however, this division of power was not easy to observe in the face of developments in NorthernIreland itself.   Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom witha land boundary, and although the Act of 1920 by no means envisaged the Irishborder as an International frontier, it steadily assumed that character asSouthern Ireland became first the Irish Free State and ultimately the irish republic.   The partition of Ireland was deeply..resented, and the new institutions of Northern Ireland were opposed, by militant elements of the republican trad-ition, who launched violent attacks upon the Province and its institutions both from within Northern Ireland and across the border.9.     In response to this threat (from time to time dormant, but periodically vrenewed) the Northern Ireland Parliament used its legislative pov/ers to enactmeasures and to establish institutions without equivalent in Great Britain,although by no means with precedent or parallel in Ireland.   The Civil Authorities(Special Pov/ers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 conferred upon the executive widepov/ers to make regulations for the protection of the State, under which provision was made, inter alia, for detention and internment without trial.   The royal ulster Constabulary established in 1922, inherited from its predecessor, theRoyal Irish Constabulary, distinctive traditions and functions which themselvesoriginated in the special public&apos;order problems of Ireland.   The Northern ireland parliament also voted moneys for the maintenance of the Ulster Special Constabularywhich was an armed force, most of whose members had been trained to carry outpatrols of a varying nature and guard duties rather than to reinforce and assistthe Royal Ulster Constabulary in the performance of police duties as geuerallyunderstood in the rest of the United Kingdom.A.
10.   There were also important areas of policy in which Northern Ireland legis-lation diverged from that in force in the rest of the United Kingdom, not becausethe Northern Ireland Parliament enacted specifically different legislation, but because it did not make changes comparable with those made in Great Britain by theUnited Kingdom Parliament.   Certain of these areas involved sensitive issues onwhich there were distinctive Northern Ireland points of views.    Some, however,involved important questions of citizen&apos;s rights.    In particular,  the NorthernIreland Parliament did not, for many years, follow the example of the United kingdom parliament in moving from a ratepayers1 franchise at local government elections toa basis of universal adult suffrage.11.   Section 75 of the Act of 1920 saved the sovereign authority of the UnitedKingdom Parliament over all matters in Northern Ireland.    In practice, however, thisreserve of power came to be used only in the most limited way.    In general the viev;prevailed that, having established responsible if subordinate institutions inN0rthern Ireland with certain powers, the United Kingdom Parliament and Governmentshould not lightly supersede or override those powers.    Thus there developed a con-vention that the United Kingdom Parliament would legislate within the field ofnorthern Ireland&apos;s &quot;transferred&quot; powers only by invitation.   This convention merelyreflected the general view of the sovereign Parliament as to the prudent exercise ofits powers; it did not, and could not, override the clear and unambiguous wording ofthe Statute.12,   The most striking feature of the executive government of Northern Irelandthroughout this period of more than half a century was its virtually completeconcentration in the hands of a single political party, the Ulster Unionist Party.At every General Election from 1921 to 1969 this Party secured an absolute majorityof the seats in the Northern Ireland Parliament.   Thus, following the general convention governing such matters in the United Kingdom, successive leaders of that party were invited by the Governor to form an Administration, and did so almostentirely from fellow members of the Party in one or other House of the NorthernIreland Parliament,  (two of the three notable exceptions being appointed in 1971 -Mr Bleakley, and Dr Newe, a Roman Catholic).
13.   The unbroken dominance of the Northern Ireland House of Commons&quot;- (and thus ofthe Government) by the Ulster Unionist Party was based upon an authentic electoralmandate.   Although the franchise up to 1968 included provision for a business vote,and electoral boundaries of the Stormont constituencies were not reviewed for manyyears, neither of these factors had any major bearing on the balance of the parties in the Northern Ireland Parliament.]A,   That alternation of governing Parites which has for so long been a character-istic of the British political system, and which has undoubtedly contributed in amarked degree to the stability of Parliamentary Government in Great Britain,accordingly did not exist in Northern Ireland.    It is true that there are otherdemocracies, whether sovereign States or self-governing areas within them&quot;,: of whichthis can also be said.   The special feature of the Northern Ireland situation wasthat the great divide in political life was not between different viewpoints on suchmatters as the allocation of resources and the determination of priorities, butbetween two whole communities.   The &quot;floating vote&quot; for which rival parties would normally compete was almost non-existent.    Thus the relationship between theparties was not fluctuating and uncertain, but virtually fixed from one Election toarriher,   iluch a situation was unlikely to foster either sensitivity on the part ofthe permanent majority, or a sense of responsibility on the part of the permanentminority.15.   It would be quite wrong to infer that, in spite of this fundamental defect atthe heart of the system, successive Governments of Northern Ireland did not achieve -with the co-operation, financial and otherwise, of successive United kingdom governments - substantial advances in many important fields of vital concern to theindividual citizen and the whole community.,    In 1921 Northern Ireland, in many ofits public services, shared with the, rest of Ireland lower standards than GreatBritain.    Over the half century which followed, schools, hospitals, roads and many other services were developed to levels fully comparable with those of any area ofGreat Britain.   Energetic industrial development policies achieved great economicdiversification and a marked increase in real wealth, though, as in certain regions .of Great Britain, this failed to bring unemployment percentages down to the national average in the face of contracting employment in certain basic industries.
16.   There were, however, persistent protests on behalf of the Roman Catholicminority that they were being excluded by deliberate policy, from their fair shareof the benefits of increasing prosperity, and from that legitimate political influence which would permit their claims to be more effectively advanced.While some of these complaints v/ere undoubtedly justified, in some cases oppor-tunities to participate were not taken up, and in others the minority, detectingan unfavourable position resulting from other circumstances, genuinely believedthat there had been bias or malice where none existed.   Thus a higher rate ofunemployment in a comparatively remote area which had a predominantly roman catholic population could be attributed by that population to governmental biasagainst it; but could also result from the real practical problems of promotingnew economic development in a remote area.   What is incontestable is that the continuous and complete control of central government by representatives of themajority alone was virtually bound to give rise to such suspicions.17.   Moreover, since the Report in 1969 of the Commission headed by Lord Cameronthere has been on record an account of deliberate policies of discrimination,particularly in relation to housing and public employment by some though not all of the local authorities in Northern Ireland, and of a toleration of localgovernment electoral boundaries in some areas which produced wholly artificialresults.*disturbances in Northern Ireland (Cmd.532 of 19^9)The Commission concluded that the general causes of the disorders which began in October 1968 were (paragraph 229(a)):&quot;(l)   A rising sense of continuing injustice and grievance among large sections of the Catholic population in Northern Ireland, in particularin Londonderry and Dungannon, in respect 01&quot; (i) inadequacy of housingprovision by certain local authorities (ii) unfair methods of alloca-tion of houses built and let by such authorities, in particular,refusals and omissions to adopt a &quot;points&quot; system in determiningpriorities and making allocations (iii) misuse in certain cases of dis-crotionary powers of allocation of houses to perpetuate Unionist controlof the local authority.
It).(2)    Complaints, now well documented in fact, of discrimination in themaking of local government appointments, at all levels but especially insenior posts, to the prejudice of nor.-Unionists and especially Catholicmembers of the community, in some Unionist controlled, authorities.(3)   Complaints, again well documented, in some cases of deliberatemanipulation of local government electoral boundaries and in others a refusal to apply for their necessary extension, in order to achieve and maintain Unionist control of local authorities and so to deny to Catholicsinfluence in local government proportionate to their numbers.CO   A growing and powerful sense of resentment and frustration amongthe Catholic population at failure to achieve either acceptance on thepart of the Government of any need to investigate these complaints or toprovide and enforce a remedy for them(5)   Sesentmoint, particularly among Catholics, as to the existence ofthe Ulster Special Constabulary (the &apos;B&apos; Specials) as a partisan andpara-military force recruited exclusively from Protestants,(6)   V/idespread resentment among Catholics in particular at the con-tinuance in force of regulations made under the Special Pov/ers Act, andof the continued presence in the statute book of the Act itself.(7)   Fears and apprehensions among Protestants of a threat to Unionistdomination and control of Government by increase of Catholic population and powers, inflamed in particular by the activities of the Ulster ConstitutionDefence Committee and the Ulster Protestant Volunteers, provoked stronghostile reaction to civil rights claims as asserted by the Civil RightsAssociation and later by the People&apos;s Democracy which was readily trans-lated into physical violence against Civil Rights demonstrators.&quot;
18.    V/hen the 1920 Act was passed, there bad teen a clear intention toprevent discrimination whether in legislation or in executive acts.    section(l) of the Act prohibited the making of laws interfering with religious equality,while section 8(6) prohibited the use of the executive power so as to give a preference, privilege or advantage, or impose a disability or disadvantage onany person on account of religious belief.     Whether because of doubts aboutthe application of section 8(6) to local authorities and public bodies as distinct from central government or because of the difficulty of proving actual bias inan individual case, these provisions were not in practice invoked by personsseeking redress before the Courts.     Thus many members of the minority felt thatthey could expect redress of grievance neither through Parliament&apos;nor thoughthe constitutional safeguards which had been written in to the Act of 1920.19.    Sy 1968 there had emerged an active and articulate movement demandingchanges in the area of civil rights, such as the acceptance of universal adultsuffrage as the basis for all elections, the redrawing of electoral boundaries,and the ending of discrimination in employment and housing.     From the start this movement was largely (though not exclusively) Roman Catholic, and although itundoubtedly attracted support from militant republicanism, its declared aim was to achieve the objectives by non-violent means.     On 5 October 1968, however, a civil Rights march took place in Londonderry in defiance of an Order madeby the Minister of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland and a violentconfrontation with the police ensued.
20,    The reactions and counter-reactions which followed led in August 1969,to widespread inter-communal disorders at a number of places in Northern Ireland,These were subsequently to be described in the report of the SCarman tribunal of Inquiry*as follows:&quot;Neither the IRA nor any Protestant organisation nor anybody elseplanned a campaign of riots.   &apos; -&quot;-hey were communal disturbances&apos; arising from acomplex political, social and economic situation.     More often than not theyarose from slight beginnings:   but the communal tensions were such that, oncebegun, they could not be controlled.&quot;   (Paragraph 2h)Even with the commitment of members of the Ulster Special Constabulary in conditions for which their training had in no adequate way prepared them, the&quot;law and order&quot; resources of the Government of Northern Ireland were stretched tobreaking point.     Piinst in Londonderry, and then in Belfast, requests were made and granted for the deployment of the Army in aid of the civil power.     This turn ofevents inevitably had profound effects upon the conventional relationship whichhad hitherto existed between the Parliament and Government of the United Kingdomand the authorities in Northern Ireland.     The practice that Parliament did not discuss, except in the most general way, matters within the &quot;transferred&quot;responsibility of Northern Ireland Ministers was discarded by general consent.   TheUnited Kingdom Government, widely supported in this respect by Members of all parties, concluded that a much deeper involvement in the domestic affairs ofNorthern Ireland was now inescapable.21c     un 19 August the Prime Minister (Mr Wilson) and a number&quot; of his seniorcolleagues met Major Chichester-Clark and other Northern Ireland Ministers at 10Downing Street.     The practical results of this meeting included the designation forthe time being of the GOC (Northern Ireland) as Commander of all the security forces in Northern Ireland, including the Ulster Special Constabulary,and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in its security role, the withdrawal of the&quot;&quot;Violence and Civil Distrubances in Northern Ireland in 1969 - Cmd 566 of 1972
Ulster Special Constabulary from anti-riot duties and strict control of itsarms, and the appointment for the first time of a senior official as UnitedKingdom Representative in Northern Ireland.   The meeting also produced the downing street Declaration,*     embodying a re-affirmation of the pledge by successiveUnited Kingdom Governments that Northern Ireland should not cease to be a partof the United Kingdom without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland, and a commitment to the principle that &quot;in all legislative and executive decisions ofgovernment every citizen of Northern Ireland is entitled to the same equality oftreatment and freedom from discrimination as obtains in the rest of the UnitedKingdom, irrespective of political views or religion&quot;.22.     In order to prevent direct confrontation between the communities in thosesensitive areas of West Belfast where they lived in homogeneous&apos; districtscontiguous to each other, one of the Army&apos;s first major acts after its involvementin August 1969 had been to build the so-called &quot;Peace Line&quot; along the sensitiveinter-face.     To a considerable extent peace was kept, but as the Army stood betweenthe communities it was drawn into conflict at different times with first one and then the other.     The earliest serious confrontation, in October 19^9, was between theArmy and Protestant elements on Belfast&apos;s Shankill Road affronted by the proposed changes in police organisation;   but as time elapsed the Provisional wing of theIrish Republican Army (consisting broadly of the more traditionally militantelements of that organisation after a split in its leadership) emergedin 1970 as a most serious threat to security and public order,     Because it wasin the Catholic areas of Belfast that the main brunt of the destruction of August&quot;1.969 had been borne, the local IRA elements were able - as they had not been bet?/een*Cmd 4154 of 1969.     The full text is:1.     The United Kingdom Government reaffirm that nothing which has happened inrecent weeks in Northern Ireland derogates from the clear pledges made by successive United Kingdom Governments that Northern Ireland should not cease to be apart of the United Kingdom without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland orfrom the provision in Section S of the Ireland Act, 1949, that in no event willNorthern Ireland or any part thereof cease to be part of the United Kingdom withoutconsent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland,   The border is not an issue
footnote to para       continued2.    The United Kingdom Government again affirm that responsibility for affairs in Northern Ireland is entirely a matter of domestic jurisdiction.     -heUnited Kingdom Government will take full responsibility for asserting this principle in all international relationships.3.    The United Kingdom Government have ultimate responsibility for theprotection of those who live in.northern Ireland when, as in the past week, a breakdown of law and order has occurred.      In this spirit, the United KingdomGovernment responded to the reqqssts of the Northern Ireland Government formilitary assistance in Londonderry and Belfast in order to restore law andorder.They emphasise again that troops will be withdrawn when lav? andorder has been restored.4,    The Northern Ireland Government have been informed that troops have beenprovided on a temporary basis in accordance with the United ?angdoia&apos;s ultimate responsibility.      In the context of the commitment of these troops, theNorthern Ireland Government have reaffirmed their intention to take into thefullest account at all times the views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom, especially in relation to matters affecting the status of citizens ofthat part of the United Kingdom and their equal rights and protection under the law.5*    The United Kingdom Government have welcomed the decisions of the NorthernIreland Government relating to local government franchise, the revision of localgovernment areas, the allocation of houses, the creation of a parliamentary commissioner for Administration in Northern Ireland and machinery to considercitizens&apos; grievances against other public authorities which the Prime Ministerreported to the House of Commons at Westminster following his meeting with northern Ireland Ministers on 21st May as demonstrating/the determination of theNorthern Ireland Government that there shall be full equality of treatment for allcitizens,   Both Governments have agreed that it is vital that the momentum ofinternal reform should be maintained.6.     The two Governments at their meeting at 10 Downing Street today havereaffirmed that in all legislation and executive decisions of Government everycitizen of Northern Ireland is entitled to the same equality of treatment and freedom from discrimination as obtains in the rest of the United Kingdom,irrespective of political views or religion.     In their further meetings&apos;the twobvernmenfca will be guided by these mutually accepted principles. \o$.

1956-62 - to project themselves as the defenders of the wider Catholic community,and thus to &quot;win substantial number.&apos;; of recruits and a considerable degree of mass support.    At first encouraging and manipulating civilian rioters (usingsuch weapons as the 3hone or petrol bomb) but gradually developing direct action with firearms and explosives against the security forces and the wider community,the ISA (largely locally recruited, but to an increasing extent under theinfluence of the movements&apos; national leadership in the Republic) steadily steppedup its efforts, requiring in response a growing commitment of troops to NorthernIreland.23.   Neither the increasingly tight security policy, involving the presence --ofthe Army in increasing strength and the use of&quot;parts of the Special Pov/ers Act,nor the implementation of announcement of a number of radical reforms (see Annex3) prevented the gradual emergence of the IRA.   By August 1971 its escalatingcampaign of violence led the Northern Ireland Government, after consultation withthe United Kingdom Government, to introduce internment; this re-inforced roman catholic leaders in the decision they had already taken a month earlier, on other grounds, to withdraw from the Northern Ireland Parliament.   As both the IRAcampaign and this political rift continued, the growing inter-communal bitternesssteadily reduced any realistic hope of political progress.
24.    Faced by this evident impasse the United Kingdom Government came tothe conclusion that it was necessary to remove from the Parliament and Governmentof Northern Ireland control over law and order.     The Northern ireland government felt unable to accept this transfer of functions, and indicated their intention to resign instead.     The United Kingdom Parliament enacted theNorthern Ireland Temporary Provisions Act 1972 in March 1972 which effectivelyvested in the Secretary of State for Northern.Ireland the powers formerlyexercised by the Northern Ireland Government.25*    Following the introduction of direct rule, the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland has been involved in intensive discussions with allshades of opinion in Northern Ireland, and has in addition invited and received many written suggestions from individual citizens of Northern Ireland.In August 1972 it was announced that a conference would be held to which eachof the seven parliamentary political parties of Northern Ireland was invitedto discuss suggestions for the future of Northern Ireland:   conference was heldat Darlington from 25 - 27 September and representatives of the Unionist alliance and Northern Ireland Labour Parties were present.     Parts II and III of ;this Paper take account of the many views which have been represented tothe Secretary of State both during this conference, and in his other consultations.

32.    To complete this account of the views of the NorthernIreland political parties, mention must be made of the general position of those parties i^hich were not represented at thewhich&apos;Darlington Conference and/have not sent to the Secretary of Stateany detailed, formal proposals for the future:(a) the Nationalist Party (five Members at Stormont beforeprorogation) and(b) the Republican labour Party (one Member) have consistently seen the future of Northern Ireland inan all-Ireland context.(c) the Democratic Unionist Party (four Members,  two ofwhom resigned their seats immediately beforeprorogation) -fea^ adopted the general attitude that,since the restoration of the Northern ireland parliament with its former powers and status is extremely unlikely Northern Ireland should cease tohave any separate legislature or executive of its o\-m,but be fully integrated with the rest of the UnitedKingdom.B.      OTHER PROPOSALS33*   There are in addition to the political pa.rties in NorthernIreland.,  other organisations, both inside and outside the Province,
which have from time to timeand accounts have been takenparagraphs 37 - 6.3.expressed views aboutof these views in thethe future,analyses in3I4..

Nor have the suggestions for the future government of NorthernIreland come only from Northern Ireland parties and organisations.Following an appeal to the people of Northern Ireland by theSecretary of State that they shoiild write to him putting forx^ardtheir own views,  some 2,500 (of which 201 were anonymous) havebeen sent to him by individual citizens.    The views expressedin those letters are taken Into account In the analyses inparagraphs 37 - 60,36.   Views have of course also been expressed by parties and interests outside Northern Ireland,    The attitude of the Governmenthas been consistently to seek by inter-party discussion the widest possible measure of agreement as to how Northern Ireland should infuture be governed and how in particular the minority as well asthe majority may be assured of an active, permanent and
guaranteed role In its life and public affairs.    The Labour Partyhave made their own specific proposals for consideration in thatcontext, based on the 15 point plan put forward by the leader of the Opposition in his House of Commons speech on25th November 1971 (House of Commons Official Report Vol.  826,No. 18. Columns 1571-1593).      This called for a carefullydeveloped advance by agreement and under acceptable terms andconditions towards the eventual reunification of Ireland to take effect 15 years from the date of reaching agreement.   During the interim period the United Kingdom Government should assume full responsibility for all aspects of security, military and police,though with maximum devolution to the Northern Ireland police authority; and the Northern Ireland Government should IncTuderepresentatives of minority views provided each such minister made clear his loyal acceptance of the interim constitution aswell as of the long-term settlement.
y].     At this stage it is possible to construct a general model of the range ofDossihilities -theoretically open before firm decisions on detailed policy are taken.In constructing this model, account can be taken not 02i.ly of the great volume ofsoecific proposals already published but of parliamentary and constitutional develop-ment in other countries,where this appears to be even potentially useful orilluminating.380   The following paragraphs accordingly set out the major components from whichthe detailed form of an ultimate settlement will have to be constructed.   Paragraphs39-^2 relate to questions of sovereignty and citizenship, paragraphs ^3-^5 to possibleforms of Government of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, paragraphs ^6-50to the division of power between United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland institutions;and paragraph 51 to the supervision of the exercise of powers by Northern Irelandinstitutions.    Paragraphs 5 r&amp;2. deal with details of possible Northern Irelandinstitutions.   The proposals for a Bill of Rights are dealt with in paragraph gi^Sovereignty and Citizenship39.    Pirst there are issues of sovereignty and citizenship concerned with NorthernIreland&apos;s status as part of the United Kingdom and its relationship with the restof Ireland.     United Kingdom policy on this matter is governed by the solemn and binding pledges given by successive governments since the decision of what is now the Irish Republic to sever its connections with the Crown and Commonwealth.     the pledge was originally expressed by Mr Attlee as Prime Minister on 28 October1948 in the words:&quot;The view of HM Government has always been that no change should be made inthe constitutional status of Northern Ireland without Northern Ireland*s freeagreement.&quot;The pledge was given the form of a statutory declaration by Section 1(2) of the Ireland Act 192,-9:&quot;It is hereby declared that Northern Ireland remains part of His Majesty&apos;5dominions and of the United Kingdom and it is hereby affirmed that in no
event will Northern Ireland or any part thereof cease: to be part of HisMajesty&apos;s dominions and of the United Kingdom without the consent of the parliament of Northern Ireland.&quot;This commitment has since been repeated by all successive Governments and as alreadynoted was incorporated in the Downing Street Declaration of 20 August 1969.     On15 November 1971 speaking at the Mansion House in London the present Prime Ministerused the following words:&quot;Many Catholics in Northern Ireland would like to see Northern Ireland unifiedwith the South.     That is understandable.     It is legitimate that they should seek to further that aim by democratic and constitutional means.   If at some future date the majority of the people in Northern Ireland want unificationand express that desire in the appropriate constitutional manner, I do notbelieve any British Government would stand in the way.     But that is not whatthe majority want today&quot;.40,     It has been argued that consideration might be given to a partial orincomplete transfer of sovereignty either In geographical terms (ie bytransferring to the Irish Republic those parts of Northern Ireland where a majority in favour of such a transfer exists) or in jurisdictional terms (eg by adopting a pattern of joint sovereign responsibility for Northern Ireland as recommended by&apos; Social Democratic and labour Partythe/ or by a scheme of condominium for which there are such precedents as the new hebrides and Andorra).     However neither of these courses if adopted withoutconsent, would be compatible with the express-ast wording of Section 1(2) of the Ireland Act 1949.     Moreover the exponents of a united Ireland all demand a unity of the whole island and show no sign of settling for less:   they might v/ell regard the establishment of an predominantly Protestant State as an obstacle to unity,41.     In announcing Direct Rule the Prime Minister stated that in the futureperiodic plebiscites would be held to allow the people of Northern Ireland to declare their views on the Border Issue.     Within the context of this general decision,specific decisions will have to be made as to how frequent the plebiscites are to be;what should be asked;   and what procedures are to be followed in the event of amajority vote at a future plebiscite in favour of constitutional change.42.     Such then is the present position.    The United Kingdom Government is bound both&quot;y statute and by clear and related pledges to the people of Northern Ireland.    It &apos;2.b
is only in this context that the following range of theoretically possible, butnot mutually exclusive, courses of action can be examined:(a)     Simply to affirm that Northern Ireland is part of the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom and will remain so:   and not even to admit the possibilityof change at any time.    This course is not without its advocates, who argue that northern Ireland cannot achieve stability as long as its constitutional futureappears to be open-ended;   but it is difficult to sustain the argument that ifNorthern Ireland is to remain part of the United Kingdom while that is the wish ofa majority, it must also so remain even if a majority wish othervvi.se,(t)     To admit the possibility of change, either towards Irish unity or some formof condominium;   but not specifically to provide for it,    This could take theform either of a &quot;neutral&quot; declaration (&quot;It is for Northern Ireland to make up itsmind what it wishes to do, but the United Kingdom government -would not stand in theway in the event of a wish for change&quot;) which has, indeed, already been made in substance by United Kingdom ministers, or of a &quot;positive&quot; declaration (TheUnited Kingdom Government would welcome the achievement of Irish unity, but this cannot come about unless and until the people of Northern Ireland freely consent toit&quot;).(c) To admit the possibility 6f change, and also to provide specific machinery bywhich it could be achieved in an orderly way, subject to consent.    It would bepossible, for instance, to lay out a theoretical path towards closer integration,and possible ultimate unity in Ireland, subject to the consent of the people ofNorthern Ireland as expressed by plebiscite before advancing from one stage toanother.(d) To legislate for future change, either gradual or rapid.    It can be argued,however, that it would be wrong to*do so if the demand for such change did not firstcone from the majority of the people in Northern Ireland;    and. while there has been much discussion of the possibility one day of an all-Ireland State, there are manyconflicting ideas as to its form and constitution, and the need for a continuing devolution of powers to Northern Ireland within such a State.
(e)   Whether or not any change is made affecting sovereignty or citizenship,nevertheless to recognise that, bccau.se of the existence of common problems,some form of joint machinery, either at inter-parliamentary or at inter-governmental level, should be established.   There is now much common groundbetween a number of the Northern Ireland parties on the need for some form of joint Council, although some wish to see a consultative and deliberative Councilalone, while others envisage a joint discharge of executive functions.    It wouldbe possible to start on the more limited basis and subsequently broaden thepowers of a Council by mutual agreement.Form of government of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdomk&apos;$.   It is noteworthy that even amongst those who advocate the earliest possibleachievement of Irish unity there is a wide measure of agreement that this couldnot come about for some considerable time.    If a plebiscite or other means of determining the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland shows that they wish toremain within the United Kingdom then the question does not arise unless and until a further expression of view shows a different result; but if a desire for unitywere to be made manifest at the first plebiscite there is a general recognition that a lengthy process of discussion and negotiation would inevitably follow.Therefore whatever; assumption is made the immediate question to be determined is how Northern Ireland should be governed so long as it remains a part of theUnited Kingdom.Ml-,   Insistence upon Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom, involvesaccepting unequivocally the ultimate sovereign authority, in all circumstances, ofthe United Kingdom Parliament over Northern Ireland as over all other parts of thecountry.   The question then posed is, what law-making and executive powers (if any)should be devolved upon specifically Northern Ireland institutions?&quot;Total in togration1&apos; -This would mean that laws for Northern Ireland, as for Great Britain, wouldhenceforth be made by the Westminster Parliament, and the prorogued StormontParliament would be abolished,    There would be a clear case for an increase in the
number of Northern Ireland Members, to bring the average numbers of electors perconstituency down to the Great Britain, or even to the more favourable Scottishlevel.   Northern Ireland business in the House of Commons might well be dealt withby a Northern Ireland Grand Committee, analgous to the Scottish Grand Committee.It would follow that there would be no separate Northern Ireland executive, andthat all the services of central government in Northern Ireland would be theresponsibility of the the United Kingdom Government.   While, in theory, separatedepartmental structures in northern Ireland could be abolished and the functionsredistributed amongst appropriate United Kingdom Departments, the more promisingcourse would be to entrust the administration of Northern Ireland services to a secretary of State and subordinate Ministers on a Scottish Office pattern.   Thiscourse would afford the best opportunity of preserving the considerableadministrative benefits of devolution.In the event of a solution along these lines, it would have to be borne inmind that, when the changes stemming from the Macrory Report are complete,responsibility for certain public services which in the rest of the United kingdom will continue to rest with local authorities will in Northern Ireland be theresponsibility of central government (ie Westminster).    In such circumstances,strong arguments would no doubt be advanced for the restoration in NorthernIreland of responsibility for those services to local government and hence for adifferent pattern of local authorities.   However, a re-opening of this issue wouldnot only involve further confusion and uncertainty, to the detriment of servicesand personnel, but might also involve consideration of further changes, such as the division of Northern Ireland into comparatively few areas, within which electedauthorities would exercise quite wide pov/ers.    Indeed it has been argued that theproblem of participation of the minority in the exercise of power could more real-istically be solved by giving- control of services to the overall minority in areas&quot;hero they are a local majority, rather than by seeking to give them a share of power at the centre.   In considering the possibility of &quot;total integration&quot; account must also be taken of the fact that the majority of parties in Northern Ireland /ireopposed to it,  that it would represent a complete reversal of the traditions of
half a century, and that it would impose a substantial new legislative burden onthe Westminster Parliament, and that it would be wholly unacceptable to theRepublic and would make cooperation with the Republic more difficult.(b) A purely executive authority (a &quot;Northern Ireland Council&quot;)This would mean that, while all power to legislate for Northern Ireland wouldbe retained at Westminster, as many executive functions as possible would be carriout by an elected regional authority for the whole of Northern Ireland,   Such an authority might have powers to introduce Private Bills at Westminster.   Powershitherto exercised under the Act of 1920 by the Northern Ireland Government, butconsidered to be unsuitable for exercise by the authority, would for the most partbe exercised by a Secretary of State, though some (such as those connected withsocial security) might be transferred to appropriate United Kingdom departments and !Ministers.   As a minimum the powers of the new authority would extend to the&quot;top-tier&quot; of services transferred from local authorities to the centre in accord-ance with the Macrory Report.    This form of solution would also imply that thereshould be an increase in the Northern Ireland membership of the House of Commons,because that body would have the legislative power for Northern Ireland.(c) A limited law making authority (A &quot;Northcm Ireland Convention&apos;&apos;)This would involve the establishment of a Northern Ireland Assembly, whichmight well have (as in pattern (b) above or otherwise)&apos;executive functions, but would also play a part in the making of laws relating exclusively to NorthernIreland.   This could involve procedures similar to those contemplated by SirAlec Douglas-Home&apos;s Scottish Constitutional Committee, under which Bills would start and finish their legislative process at Westminster but be taken throughintervening stages in a local Convention.   Such a Convention could also question a Secretary of State and subordinate Ministers in relation to the exorcise ofpowers rexserved to them.(d) A powerful legislative and executive^ (a Northern, Ireland Parliament orAssemblyThis would involve either the restoration of a full-scale Parliament andsystem of Cabinet, government with powers comparable with those hitherto exercisedst Stormont, or the creation of a new Assembly and Executive capable both ofBo
enacting laws and of administering the public services within the powers devolvedupon them.I-/).   With the exception of Course (a), each of the solutions discussed in paragraphhk has certain elements of &quot;integration&quot; (reservation of power to the UnitedKingdom Parliament and Government) and certain elements of &quot;devolution&quot; (grant of power to Northern Ireland institution) - but the balance between reservation anddevolution of power differs from one model to another.Divij;ion of powers between United Kingdom and Northern Ireland institutionskS,   The division of powers is clearly bound up with the view taken on the questionof methods of government (paragraphs       and &apos;r3), but it also involves the separate consideration both of the extent of powers (&apos;    which functions should be allocated to Northern Ireland institutions?) and the degree of supervision of them byWestminster (     how genuinely autonomous ought the exercise of the devolved powersto be?).k&apos;?.   Pirst, extent of powers.    There are a number of different aspects from whichthis problem has been considered by the interests in Northern Ireland:(a) There is first, what may be described as the &quot;argument from Hacrory&quot;, whichproceeds from the contention that the entire scheme of re-organisation of localgovernment recommended by the Macrory Neport assumed the existence of Stormont asa top-tier authority in relation to services transferred from local government, andthat therefore any new institutions should as a minimum have power to deal with those services as Stormont would have done.(b) There is the &quot;argument from social values&quot;, which-maintains that NorthernIreland ought to have the power to preserve conditions of social behaviour generally acceptable to its own citizens, even where these are different from those in GreatBritain (so that laws relating to issues such as abortion or divorce could reflectlocal religious or other standards): however, it may be noted that the NorthernIreland Labour Party, in its published proposals, took precisely the opposite view.(c) There is the &quot;argument for the preservation of distinctive, patterns ofadministration&quot;, which proceeds from the contention that in Northern Ireland manyservices, because of special local conditions .or special efforts to overcome local
problems have been developed along distinctive lines and that the ability to do this, and to preserve such advantages as Northern Ireland may gain thereby, shoulcnot be lost.(d)   --There is, as a converse, the &quot;argument against the retention of meaninglesspowers&quot;,based on the view that it is pointless for Northern Ireland to retainnotional powers to do something different from Great Britain (eg in relation tothe cash social services) while in practice have to do very much the same thingsbecause Northern Ireland alone does not have the economic or other resourcesnecessary to follow a different and autonomous policy.
48,   Much the most difficult decisions relate to the issues of finance andof what might be called divisive powers:   part I of this Green Paper has sought to Illustrate how, in pi-actice, the operation of certain powers in Northern Irelandproved controversial and divisive.   The matters involved included electoral lav/and boundaries, the courts and the general administration of justice, security, andoublic order, emergency powers and the police,   This cannot be an exhaustive list,for in a divided and tense society almost any matter can be made an occasion of conflict, but it does include those matters which have occasioned much bitterness.Strong arguments have accordingly been advanced either that all or most of these powers should be excluded from the responsibilities of any new institutions inNorthern Ireland, or that at the least their exercise should be subject to the moststringent controls and safeguards against any possible abuse.   It is argued that, ifany new constitution for Northern Ireland permits majority government, the majoritymay use such powers oppressively or discriminatorily;   and that if, on the otherhand, a new constitution seeks to promote broadly-based government, the exerciseof the divisive powers would submit such a government to intolerable strains.   Onthe other hand, there are those who argue, in relation to the &quot;law and order&quot; powers in particular, that these are fundamental to the operation of anything which can becharacterised as a government; or, that the more real and pressing px-oblems are, theraore important it is to force representatives of the community concerned to face upto them.   It is not the purpose of this Paper to strike a balance now between these conflicting arguments, but in considering questions of security, the overall resvponsibility    of the central government for the defence of the realm and the operationof the armed forces must be taken fully into account.Finally, there is the question of finance.   Here there is a very strongtheoretical argument that any Northern Ireland institutions with appreciablefunctions will not be capable of developing real- political responsibility, imaginationand courage unless they also have to provide the resources for carrying them out.
But the hard logic of the situation .must be faced,,   To meet this requirement itwould be necessary either to supplement Northern ireland s own resources with large unconditional grants (and it may be questioned whether any United kingdom parliament could or would provide additional assistance on a massive scaleautomatically and without conditions) or to reduce Northern Ireland&apos;s expenditure to relate it to the area&apos;s true means (and that would involve a radicalreduced .In    all public expenditure and a possible failure to tiiai ltain parity of standards with the rest of the United Kingdom.   As an alternative to either of theseradical courses, it would be valuable to consider how assistance to&apos; NorthernIreland might be channelled in such a way as to give to the Northern Irelandinstitution the power to make their own decisions&apos;within defined financial limits.50*   Supervision of powers. It should be appreciated that the devolution of powersto subordinate institutions does not leave these institutions completely free toexercise such powers as they v/ish.   Under the Act of 1920 as it stands, the sovereignauthority of the Westminster Parliament is expressly saved by Section 75) the courtsmay review the validity of Acts of the Northern Ireland Parliament, and certainconstitutional questions may be referred to the Judicial Committee of the privy council,   Under his Instructions the Governor; may reserve the Royal Assent toa Korthern Ireland Bill, and there was one such case, although the Bill in question was eventually allowed to become law.   There are other possible patterns of supervision.   Any Acts passed by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and the isle of Man are subject to the approval of Her Majesty in Council and the Crown actsthrough the Privy Council on the recommendation of United Kingdom Ministers,   Thiswight be described as &quot;governmental supervision&quot;.   Another theoretical device wouldbe . &quot;parliamentary supervision&quot; b y which the legislation of a Northern ireland parliament or Assembly (or defined categories thereof, possibly within the fieldsi &quot;     -/
described earlier as &quot;divisive&quot;) would either require an affirmative resolution at westminster to be given the force of law, or could be &quot;prayed against&quot; within a prescribed time.    (These parliamentary sanctions at present exist in relation to northern Ireland legislation during the currency of the Temporary Provisions Actbyway of Orders-in-Council.)   Other theoretical possibilities indicate supervisionby some form of joint United Kingdom/Northern Ireland Parliamentary Commission, orby a &quot;Council of State&quot; of Northern Ireland notables appointed by theUnited Kingdom Government.Northern Ireland Institutions51.   The complex question of the form, structure, composition and functioning ofa Northern Ireland Parliament or Assembly and executive is again inter-related withthe questions already discussed.   Separate analysis is, however, required of fourdistinct but related questions - the form etc. of any representative assembly inNorthern Ireland;   the form etc, of the executive in Northern Ireland;   the form oflocal government in Northern Ireland and its relationship to the Assembly and theExecutive;   and the implications of these   three questions for the relationship between the Assembly and the Executive on the one hand, and Westminster on the other.52. A Representative Assembly:   Form of Assembly.     It will be seen from thesubmissions of some of the parties that there is a view that any new legislatureshould mot be called a Parliament, because both the title and the adoption ofelaborate Westminster procedures have not only been out or proportion to the realfunctions independently performed and to the size of population covered by them, sothat these arrangements have, led to what may be described as &quot;over-government&quot;,but also have promoted a false view of &quot;Stormont sovereignty&quot; which has been positivelyharmful.   Amongst those who hold this view there is strong support for the title of assembly&quot;.   The Ulster Unionist Party does not share this view, and its proposalscall for the continuation of a Northern Ireland Parliament.   They share- wplth others,however, the opinion that there should henceforth b  a single chamber legislature,If
with membership of the order of 72 - 100.   There appears to be comparatively little support for a second chamber in a new structure although, in consideringthe range of theoretical options, it should bo appreciated that the second chamberis used in a number of jurisdictions to give particular interests a weight they wouldnot achieve through a popular-elected chamber based on universal suffrage, and/or toallow measures to be blocked by the second chamber so weighted.   A second chamberis also frequently used to introduce into parliamentary life the respresentatives ofcertain broad &quot;interests&quot; (as, indeed, is the case in the Senate of the irish republic) but there is of course nothing - except opposition in principle to thedilution of the popular mandate - to prevent the nomination to a single chamberAssembly (or to its committees) of representatives of important interests or ofcommunities under-represented following an election.53-.   The nature of an Assembly may also be influenced by the basis and method ofelections to it;   and it is apparent from the submissions of the political parties thatthere is a good deal of support for the use in Northern Ireland of the single transferable Vote (STV) system of proportional representation (although the UlsterUnionist Party, in recommending a chamber of some 100 members, notes that this increase &quot;would reduce the need for proportional representation since there wouldbe fewer wasted majorities&quot;).   Another theoretical, possibility is the use of separate or multiple voting rolls.   This mechanism assures a minority community of adequate representation, but it does so at considerable risk of entrenchingdivisions and encouraging polarisation.5^.   As to the method of working of an Assembly, again there is considerableagreement amongst the Northern Ireland political parties that there should be a highly-developed system of functional committees, and some have advocated that thechairmanships of such committees should be shared amongst the parties, ratheru
than concentrated in majority hands.   While the post of chairman is obviouslyone of real influence and importance, and the more so if committees have reallysignificant executive as distinct from advisory or consultative responsibilities,the establishment of a committee system does not of itself assure the participation of minorities in the exercise of power,   It is the normal practice, both in parliamentary and local government, that committees should constitute a microcosm ofof the whole body, with the majority of the whole constituting also a majority of eachcommittee.   Thus, the application to Northern Ireland of a system of committeegovernment would make the application of executive pov/er less concentrated, but inthe last resort matters put to a vote would be carried by the elected majority.   Thiswould be true whether the committees served as a check on the executive (as the UlsterUnionist Party proposes) or themselves constituted the executive (as proposed byother parties).56,   There are various forms of blocking mechanism inside or outside an Assembly,some of which (such as a Council of State or a degree of supervision by the sovereign Parliament or Government) have already been mentioned.   There are also anumber of overseas precedents,   Thus, in Belgium, with its problem of linguisticdivisions, three-quarters of either language group in Parliament can cause anydraft legislation to be referred back to the Council of Ministers if it is consideredharmful to inter-communal relations.   In Switzerland, any law passed by the federal assembly may be made the subject of a national referendum if 30,000 eligible votersso request within 90 days.
5f,     Tlie Executive.     Here the crucial question is whether, in addition toany heightening of their influence, it is desirable and possible to securethe participation of the Northern Ireland minority in the actual exercise of executive powers.     On the one hand, it can be argued that in Northern Ireland,as in many other democracies, those who represent a majority in thelegislature should have the right to form the government;    that any form ofcoalition tends to provide weak and indecisive government, and all the more so if it comes about artificially, rather than by the voluntary collaboration of parties with real mutual interest that the underlying problem of NorthernIreland can only be solved by the slow and steady evolution of new partystructures rooted in both communities:   and that, bearing in mind the realpractical problems which must be solved in Northern Ireland, it would be most dangerous to make complex arrangements which can be manipulated to producedeadlock and frustration.On the other hand, it can be argued that the British democratic systemonly works where a regular alternation of parties is possible;    that the realtest of a democratic system is its ability to provide peaceful and orderlygovernment, and that by that standard the existing system in Northern ireland has failed;    that other countries with divided communities have made specialconstitutional provision to ensure participation by all;    that a number ofthese countries have had perfectly stable and successful coalition governmentsover many years; and that there is no hope of binding the minority to thesupport of new political arrangements in Northern Ireland unless they are admitted to active participation in any new structures.5$.     If the need for actual participation is admitted, there are a number of ways in which it might in practice bo achieved.     Reference has already beenmade to the proposal that executive powers in Northern Ireland should beexercised through a structure of committees, and of the difficulty that, while this would increase the active part played by minority interests, it wouldnot in the last resort prevent decisions being taken on a majority vote, if in the event decisions developed along party lines.     If, on the other hand,IB
Northern Ireland were to continue to have a Government, Cabinet or ^xecutivas such, other considerations would apply.     In other jurisdictions, a broabasis of government is sometimes achieved by convention, and sometimes byformal constitutional provision,$5*     Apart from what may be described as &quot;committee government&quot;, which hasalready been discussed, there are at least four theoretical means ofsecuring a broadly-based administration in Northern Ireland.(a) &apos;^j?jrenched government&quot;, whereby certain minority elementsmust by constitutional requirement be included in a government,This course could present very difficult problems of definition,and impede the development of non-sectarian party structures.(b) &quot;PJ^^TOrnn^nt&quot;, whereby aJLl substantial elements elected to the legislature would, in proportion to their respectivestrengths, secure representation in a government.     Thiscourse could, however, exclude the possibility of any opposition as currently understood in the legislature andwould not bo made easier by the very broad range ofpolitical opinion.(c) &quot;Blocm goyernment11, whereby the party or partiescommanding a majority in the legislature would be requiredto coalesce with the party or parties commanding a majorityof the minority.     This -would ensure some residual opposition,and make possible the exclusion of small irresponsible groupson the extreme wings of politics, but it in practice would beapt to prove a somewhat complex, inflexible and artificialdevice.(d) &quot;Weighted majority government&quot;, whereby an incominggovernment would require the endorsement of the legislaturenot by a simple majority, but by a majority so weighted asto make necessary a broad range of support.     In order toensure that support would not come from representatives of&apos;asingle community, the percentage required, could hardly beless than 75,     The requirement of a weighted majority could
be applied s**ley to the endorsement of a Government and subsequent Votes-of-Confidence, or to o wider range ofparliamentary bu sine s s.6$,     It must be recognised that there is, in the use of any of thesedevices, an inherent danger that any major political element could choose,for its own purposes, to bring the system to a standstill,     Any suchsystem would therefore have to be under-pinned by clear, swift and efficientprocedures for the resolution of disputes and the exercise of reserve powers:and such procedures carry the dangerous dilemma that if the political groupingsare deadlocked, the holder of reserve powers must either override them or allow the deadlock to persist,^*     IggjI.,Government,     In the context of any system of administration inNorthern Ireland, account must clearly be taken of the &quot;Macrory&quot; re-organisationof local services.     The restructuring of local government in Northern Ireland,as in many other cases, proved a difficult and time-consuming affair:    there were a number of false starts before the Macrory review body completed Its reportin 1970.     The scheme of local government adopted on the basis of this report was to reduce the existing, basically two-tier structure of local government toa single-tier system of 26 elected district councils exercising localenvironmental powers:   while large scale regional services were to be transferredto the central government, to be managed either directly (e0g, water, sewerage,roads, electoral arrangements) or through Area Boards (personal social services,education and libraries).     Flans had already been made to transfer housingadministration to a statutory body, the Mousing Executive,     T/hen the StormontParliament was prorogued some of the measures necessary to carry these reformsinto effect had already been enacted, some were iri the process of passing throughthat Parliament, and others had still to be introduced.     Planning for the detailed implementation of the new structure was far advanced and theuncertain!ty about local government could not be allowed to persist for muchlength without serious risk to its future viability.     In these circumstances,the United Kingdom government decided that the re-organisation programme shouldcontinue, and be carried through to completion, under the temporary powersgranted by Parliament,     While it would be theoretically possible, after the rc-
organisation takes full effect on 1 April, 1973, to &quot;unscramble&quot; it again,there are extremely strong arguments against doing so, if the efficiency of thepublic services and the morale of those 60,000 people involved in the operationof them are not to be impaired.     It v/as an inherent part of the &quot;Macrory&quot;structure that the Northern Ireland Parliament would constitute a top-tierauthority of democratic scrutiny and control of services to be managedhenceforth on a Province-wide basis;    and there is a need for a central bodycapable of carrying out that particular function.63.     Representation of Northern Ireland interests in the United^.kingdom parliament and Government,Consideration of the number of Members sent by Northern Ireland-to the parliament at Westminster would rest on a number of factors including theextent of pov/ers devolved upon Northern Ireland;    the basis of election to westminster (whether the same as for the rest of the United Kingdom, or thesame as at other Northern Ireland elections even if these are conducted on adifferent basis);   and the nature and extent of Westminster involvement inmatters covered by devolved powers.     Taking into account the nature of anyinstitutions proposed for Northern Ireland and of the powers to be given to them,arrangements will also have to be made to ensure the continuing effectiverepresentation of Northern Ireland interest within the United Kingdom government.Moreover, the United Kingdom government will clearly have a major continuinginterest in Northern Ireland which must be recognised by suitable machinery ofgovernment in London and Belfast.Bill of Rights.     Finally there is a wide body of opinion that a Milof Rights should be enacted in Northern Ireland,   There is much to commend thissuggestion but in devising any Bill of Rights certain fundamental problems must first be faced, such as what rights are to be enshrined;   whether they should be protected through the Courts t?r by a body specially set up for that purpose;   how to secure practical, effective and speedy means of redress and compensation;and how to deal with those who consistently and deliberately infringe therights of others.   What is essential is that any provisions which might be incorporated in legislation should have a practical and not just a declaratoryeffect.
bcj.    Part I has dealt with the development; of the current situation, and Part IIwith the proposals and possibilities available to those who must determine theway forward.    This part of the Paper, while not setting out to pre-judge theultimate form of a settlement, places on record some unalterable facts about thesituation, and some vital conditions which must be met.66.    The financing of services in Northern Ireland.   Northern Ireland contains35/3 of the population of the whole of Ireland, and 2.5/^ of the population of theBritish Isles.   Average earnings per head in April 1971 were only 85^ of theGreat British average, and unemployment percentages have also consistently beenhigher than in Great Britain.67.    Such a community has required, and has received in common with other lessprosperous areas substantial material support from the United Kingdom as a whole.This lias taken many different forms: details of the financial arrangements aregiven in the White Paper &quot;Northern Ireland: Financial Arrangements and Legislation&quot;(Cmnd 4998), in paragraph 15 of which it is demonstrated that special payments and subsidies amounted to some  125 million in 1971/72, and are expected to increase.This compares with a Northern Ireland budget for that year of some  ^30 million.In addition, industries vital to Northern Ireland, particularly shipbuilding and aircraft, have been given financial support by Westminster.    It must, of course,be remembered that the people of Northern Ireland bear tax obligations virtuallyidentical with those borne by their fellow-citizens in Great Britain, and havemade their own distinctive contributions in peace and in war to the progress,life and survival of the nation.68.   The Armed Forces.    More recently, the assistance has gone far beyond theprovision of financial and economic aid.    Since August 1969 when it became apparent that the existing forces of law and order were unable (for whateverreasons) to control a deteriorating security situation, an increasing military commitment became inevitable.   On the eve of the disorders in August 1969 thenormal peace time strength of the Andy in Northern Ireland stood at some 3)000men; on 12 July 1970 at 13,000; on the day of internment, 9 August 197-1, at
some 14,000;    and on the day of Operation M0T0RMAN on 31 July 1972, at about21,000 men,     This commitment has proved increasingly onerous and by 1 October197&apos;-, Regular Army casualties in Northern Ireland stood at 132 dead and 080 wounded,6$,     It may be argued by some people in Northern Ireland that the situation could, and should, have been dealt with by security forces responsible to theNorthern Ireland Government,   It should be remembered in this context that the commitment of the Army in aid of the civil power came about only at the requestof the Northern Ireland Government and after the civil power in Northern ireland had failed to contain the situation by use of the regular and reserve forces available to it.     It must also be emphasised that this commitment preceded theHunt Report and the subsequent reorganisation of the police. .. Nor could thesituation as it has since developed have been met other than by the raising of a local full-time military force, which is outside the constitutional competence of the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland,70&apos;,     As in the financial and economic fields, so in the security field thesupport accorded to Northern Ireland is what its inhabitants (many of whom have themselves served with distinction in the Armed Forces) have a right to expect ascitisens of the United Kingdom;   but its extent is not always adequately appreciated,72&apos;     Moreover, it is quite apparent that, once peace and stability in NorthernIreland have been restored, its rehabilitation and the restoration of its fullpotential for social and economic growth will involve an investment of national economic resources on a very substantial scale.     The mere task of replacing and compensation for what has been damaged or destroyed will be enormous, but beyond this lies the still more demanding work of re-creating confidence and the capacity to attract new investment at the high rat-e required.     These tasks willdemand an effort not just by Northern Ireland but by the United Kingdom as awhole.XJl.     The I nt erde P^denco ^fj^^ey.^,jp gland.   Any proposed political settlement which considered Northern Ireland in isolation would be unrealistic.    In a world of growing inter-dependence, where even the aspirations of major sovereign powerscan only be fully met by their participation in wider associations and communities,a small area such as Northern Ireland cannot, without, the gravest consequences
for its own citlscns, wake its own v/ny.     Kvcn if it wore feasible for1 NorthernIreland so to reduce its expenditures as to bo able to live within its own realr,-rus - and such a reduction would greatly lower- the standards of life and of services enjoyed by the whole community -it would remain dependent uponexternal investment and external trade, and upon its standing and credit-worthinessi;i the European and the wider international communities,7&apos;A,     Northern Ireland cannot expect to negotiate a. form of independence whichivould guarantee substantial continuing financial, economic and military aid fromthe United Kingdom but which would otherwise confer upon it virtually sovereignstatus,     No United Kingdom Government  could be a party to such asettlement.   Nor could any United Kingdon Government in honour and in consciencesimply withdraw from its obligations to so many United Kingdom&quot;citizens in a way which could lead to the most serious disorder and instability within sight ofthe mainland of Great Britain.   It nay be argued by some that if Northern Ireland was prepared to accept a drastic fall in the standards of living and services it could in that sense be viable though at a vary high cost to all its people;   but thatis too limited, a view.     Such a form of government could rot bo viable in amuch more fundamental sense, that of being a state commanding the loyalty of the overwhelming majority of its own citizens and the respect of the internationalcommunity&apos;.
7$.     Division and disorder in Northern Ireland are liabilities both to that province and to the United Kingdom as a whole;   and in seeking to restore order and resume progress there the United Kingdom Government are serving both thenational interest and the true interest of all the people of Northern Ireland,The United Kingdom Government has three major concerns in Northern Ireland,First, that it should be internally at peace - a divided and strife-riddenProvince is bound to disturb and weaken the whole Kingdom,     Second, that itshould prosper, so as to contribute to and not detract from the prosperity ofthe whole.     Third, that Northern Ireland should not offer a base for any externathreat to the security of the United Kingdom.      In pursuing these objectives,HK Government will wish to consider at all tines the views and interests inNorthern Ireland and to take than as fully as possible into account.     So longas it is the wish of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland that theProvince 3hould remain part of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom Parliamentmust bo the sovereign authority over all persons, matters and things in NorthernIreland, and the ultimate acceptance of that authority must be a necessarycondition of the financial, economic and military assistance from which NorthernIreland benefits as a part of the United Kingdom.     While such assistancecontinues, or may be required in the future, no Government could recommend asettlement to Parliament which did not give the Government an effective voice in the use to which it is put.        ^ .
7-6?    A recognition of the right of self-determination of the people of NorthernIreland does not exclude the legitimate interest of other parties.     To say thatit would be wrong to terminate,the relationship between Northern Ireland and therest of the United Kingdom against the wishes of a majority in Northern ireland is not to say that it is for Northern Ireland alone to determine how it shallbe governed as a part of the United Kingdom, since its association with GreatBritain involves rights and obligations on both sides;    it is to say thatinsistence upon membership of the United Kingdom carries with it the obligations of membership including acceptance of the sovereignty of Parliament as representingthe people as a whole.THE IRISH DIVISION7&amp;.     A settlement must also recognise Northern Ireland&apos;s position within ireland as a whole.     The guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland that the    status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom will not be changed without their consent is an absolute:   this pledge cannot and will not be sot aside.Nevertheless it is a fact that Northern Ireland is part of the geographicalentity of Ireland;    that it shares with the Irish Republic common problems, suchas the under-development of -western areas;   and that, in the context of membership of the European      Cosffiunities,       Northern Ireland and the Republic will have certain common difficulties and opportunities which will differ in some respects from those which will face Great Britain.     It is also a fact that an element ofthe minority in northern Ireland has hitherto seen itself as simply a part of the*
wider Irish community. The problem of accommodating that minoritywithin the political structures of northern Ireland has to some considerable extantbeen an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.     Hven if the minorityhad themselves been more disposed, and more encouraged than they wore, to acceptthe settlement of 19?0, they would still have been subject to those- powerfulinfluences which regard the unification of Ireland as &quot;unfinished business&quot;, declined to accept the institutions of Northern Ireland as legitimate, and were made manifestin the Irish Constitution of 1937.     As long as such influences continue to existthey are bound to be a powerful factor to be taken into account in the search forstability in Northern Ireland.     Moreover the problem of politic-1 terrorism, whichhas reached such proportions in Northern Ireland today, has always had manifestationsthroughout the island (although, of course, the great majority of those who wishto see the unification of Ireland do not advocate or approve of the use of violenceto achieve it).7^.     No United Kingdom Government for many years has had any wish to impede the realisation of Irish unity, if it wore to come about by genuine and freely givenmutual agreement and on conditions acceptable to the distinctive communities.Indeed the Act of 1920 itself, which has for so many years been the foundation ofNorthern Ireland.&apos;s constitutional status, explicitly provided moans to move towardsultimate unity on just such a basis;   but the will to work this was never present.It is a matter of historical fact that     this    failure     stemmedfrom decisions and actions repeatedly taken, not only in Groat Britain and Northern
Ireland but in the   Republic of Ireland also.no.     Whatever arrangements are made for the future administration of northernIreland must take account of the Prov3.nce&apos;s relationship with the Republic ofIreland:   and to the extent that this is done, there is an obligation upon theRepublic to reciprocate.     Both the economy and the security of the two areas areto some considerable extent inter-dependent, and the same is true of both in theirrelationship with Great Britain.     It is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of northernIreland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to and accepted by theRepublic of Ireland which from 1st January, 1973 will share the rights and obligations of membership of the European Communities.     It remains the view of the UnitedKingdom Government that it is for the people of Northern Ireland to decide what should be their relationship to the United Kingdom and to the Republic of Ireland:and that it should not be impossible to devise means which will meet the best interests of all three.     Such means would seek to secure the acceptance, in bothNorthern Ireland and in the Republic, of the present status of Northern Ireland,;: 7       &quot;     .VY^V;;*:&apos;   &apos; \7&apos;0&quot;.&quot;&apos;; &apos;,   &apos;&apos;: 7 &apos; v0 ad-7a--. ; 7 7: y v, 7&apos;.&apos; v&apos;:-7v.and of the possibility - which would have to be compatible with the principle ofconsent - of subsequent change in that status;   to make possible effectiveconsultation and co-operation in Ireland for the benefit of North and South alike;: 7&apos;.7a      . a   7 :&apos; ^:   - -   f &apos; - &quot; &quot; a   .&apos; &apos;77.&apos;;.a&apos;.:.&apos; ;       ;..and to provide a firm basis for concerted governmental and community action against those terrorist organisations which represent a threat to free democratic&apos;   7 &apos;institutions in Ireland as a whole.
PART IV:    THE WAY FORWARD7^.   What conclusions may be drawn from the foregoing reviewof fact or opinion about the future shape of the administrationof Northern Ireland?    In general,  there are widely-differingviews about the desirable functions, powers and form of an assembly or authority, and its precise relationship with the sovereign Parliament and Government of the United Kingdom. Atthe one extreme, the argument is for a substantial form of regional authority; at the other, for a Parliament which wouldnot only have the existing powers of the Northern ireland parliament but would be in a position to exercise them morefreely.    This is not the appropriate stage at which to form afinal judgment on these matters, but in the view ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government any firm proposals must meet thefollowing criteria -(a) In accordance with the specific pledges given by successive United Kingdom Governments, NorthernIreland must and will remain part of the UnitedKingdom for as long as that Is the wish of a majorityof the people; but that status does not preclude thenecessary taking into account of what ha.s been described in this Green Paper as the &quot;Irish Dimension(b) As long as a majority of people of Northern Irelandwish to remain part of the United Kingdom:    the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament must beacknowledged, and due provision made for the&quot;UnitedKingdom Government to have an effective and continuln,
voice in Northern Ireland&apos;s affairs,  commensurate with the commitment of financial,  economic and military resources in the Province.Any division of powers and responsibilities betweenthe national and the regional authorities must belogical,  open and clearly understood.    Ambiguity inthe relationship is a prescription for confusion andmisuaderstanding.    Any necessary checks, balances orcontrols must be apparent on the face of a new constitutional scheme.The two primary purposes of any new institutions mustbe first to seek a much wider consensus than hashitherto existed; and second to be such as will workefficiently and will be capable of providing, the concrete results of good government:    peace and order,physical development, social and economic progress.This is fundamental because Northern Ireland&apos;s problemsflow not just from a clash of national aspirations orfrom friction between  the communities, but also fromsocial and economic conditions such as inadequatehousing and unemployment.Any new Institutions must be of a simple andbusinesslike character, appropriate to the powersand functions of a regional authority in acomparatively small area.So
A Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of Involving all its members constructivelyin ways which satisfy them and those they representthat the whole community has a part to play in thegovernment of the Province.    As a minimum this wouldinvolve assuring minority groups of an effective voiceand a real influence; but there are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should beachieved by giving minority interests a&quot;share in theexercise of executive power if this can be achieved by means which are not unduly complex or artificial,and which do not represent an obstacle to effectivegovernment.There must be an assurance, built into any newstructures, that there will be absolute fairness andequality of opportunity for all.    The future administration of Northern Ireland must be seen to be completely even-handed both in law and in fact.It is of great importance that future arrangementsfor security and public order in Northern Ireland mustcommand public confidence, both, in Northern Irelanditself, in the United Kingdom as a whole,If they are to do so they must be seen in practice tobe as impartial and effective as possible in restoringand maintaining peace and public order.    In any situationsuch as that xtfhiclr obtains at present, where the Armyand the civilian police force are both involved in
maintaining law and order and combatting terrorism,it is essential that there should be a single source of direct responsibility.    Since Westminster alone cancontrol the Armed -Forces of the Grown this unifiedcontrol must mean Westminster control.   For the futureany arrangements must ensure that the United KingdomGovernment has an effective and a determining voice in relation to any circumstances which involve, or may involve in the future, the commitment of the armed forces, the use of emergency powers, or repercussionsat international level.20.    The objective now must be to advance as rs.pidly as possibletowards the preparation of a comprehensive nex^ scheme for thegovernment of Northern Ireland which will satisfy thoir v-We-se-fundamental conditions.8(1.    The period of one year for x^hich, tuiless extended, theNorthern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1972 remains inforce,  comes to an end on 30th March, 1973*   While it ispossible to extend its application for a further limited perioduntil more permanent arrangements are made, there are stronggrounds for &quot;keeping such a period to a minimum.    The temporaryarrangements for the discharge of both law-making and executive responsibilities are not suitable for long-term use.In particular, it would be unsatisfactory to ,continue indefinitelymaking important legislative provision for Northern Ireland by wayof Orders in Gouncil,  or to have Northern Ireland for a lengthyperiod both under-represented in the Westminster Parliament andwith no effective democratic forum of its own.   Moreover,continuing-uncertainty about the future is unsettling to the
public service,  and. can feed the fears and suspicions of a wider public.8$,.    As the Government move towards a settlement they will ofcourse wish to continue to take northern Ireland opinion fully into account.    In this regard,  something may be learned fromthe local government elections which are to take place on 6th December.    The wishes of the people of Northern Ireland ontheir relationship to the United Kingdom and to the Republic willbe ascertained by a plebiscite early in the New Year.    But Itwill be essential for the formulation of new arrangements tohold further and separate consultations on the issues and optionsset out in this G-A^ .*J Paper, with the object of discovering hovrfar the various stands of opinion can be brought together into abroad consensus.    Such a process must of its nature bea.pragn:tetic and must take a form which permits those who acceptthe need for peaceful discussion to take part.8B.    When the process of constxltation has been completed, theUnited Kingdom Government have the responsibility of putting forward proposals, and of recommending them to Parliament,    Theywill do this In the knowledge that there is no definite answer to questions as difficult and long-standing7as these; no panaceawhich can transform strife into harmony.   Whatever theconstitutional arrangements may be, many difficult practical problems will remain.    There is not least the great need to ridNorthern Ireland of the presence and threat of violence.    Both
political theory and practical experience show that no schemeof government, however carefully drawn, can do more thanpresent an opportunity for progress.    It Is in the hearts andminds of the people of Northern Ireland, and not just in the aims of Government or the words of Acts of Parliament, that thecapa.city for working and living together must flourish.   For theultimate truth is that the people of Northern Ireland need eachother, and that to squander their great talents in bitterconflict is to diminish the prospects of them all.    It is theprofound wish and hope of the United Kingdom Government that thisfundamental truth will be recognised, and will be the basis onwhich all concerned will take part, in the further consultationsfor which this Paper is introduced to provide a basis.
THE GOVERNMENT OP IRELAND ACT 1920:   THE ORIGINAL SCHEMEOP GOVERNMENTI. The main points of the Act of 1920 as it came into force in Northern Irelandwere as follows:(i)   It provided for the establishment in Belfast of abicameral Parliament, consisting of a 52 member Houseof Commons elected by Proportional Representation, anda Senate of 26 Members, 24 elected by the Members ofthe Northern Ireland House of Commons and two (tiieLord Mayor of Belfast and Mayor of Londonderry) sittingex officio.(ii)   This Parliament wras given a general power to make lawsfor &quot;the peace, order and good government&quot; of NorthernIreland, subject to certain specific reservations,conditions and safeguards.     In particular:(a) The Act specifically reserved to the Parliamentof the United Kingdom certain powers principallyrelating to the Armed Forces, the Crown, and international matters,(b) Tho fiscal powers of the Northern ireland parliament were severely restricted by the reservation to the Parliament of tho UnitedKingdom of power to levy income tax, customsexcise duties.
(c) The Northern Ireland Parl.Lcur.ent was specificallyprohibited from making- laws and the northernIreland Government from taking administrative action other than on a basis of religiousequality.(d) Section 75 of the Act provided that:&quot;the supreme authority of the Parliamentof the United Kingdom shall remain unaffectedand undiminished over all persons, matters and tilings in /J?orthern7 Ireland and every part thereof&quot;.(iii)   The Governor of Northern Ireland, in whom the executive powers of the Northern Ireland Parliament were vested,was &quot;aided and advised&quot; by &quot;the executive committee ofthe Privy Council, or Cabinet consisting of ministers of Northern Ireland.(iv)   Northern Ireland was to be represented in the Parliamentof the United Kingdom by 12 Members for territorialconstituencies and one for the Queen&apos;n University of belfast.(v)   Northern Ireland was to make towards &quot;Imperial liabilitiesand expenditure&quot; a &quot;just&quot; contribution having regard tothe relative taxable capacities, of Northern Ireland andthe United Kingdom as a whole.
2.      The Act also made provision for a Council of Ireland, whose purpose wasdefined in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Government of Ireland Bill in thefollowing terms:&quot;Although at the beginning there are to be two Parliamentsand two Governments in Ireland, the Act contemplates and affordsevery facility for union between North and South, and empowersthe two Parliaments by mutual agreement and joint action to terminate partition and to set up one Parliament and one government for the whole of Ireland,     With a view to the eventual establishment of a single Parliament, and to bringing about harmonious action between the two Parliaments and Governments,there.is created a bond of union in the meantime by moans of a council of Ireland, which is to consist of 20 representativeselected by each Parliament, and a President nominated by theLord Lieutenant.     It will fall to the members of this body to initiate proposals for united action on the part of thetwo Parliaments and to bring forward these proposals in therespective Parliaments.&quot;The Act reserved, certain specific but limited matters to the Council, providedthat the Belfast and Dublin Parliaments might confer additional functions upon it by identical legislation, and charged it with the specific duty of considering what further matters might, in the general interest of the whole of Ireland, best be administered on a central basis rather than by the two separate administrations.
ANNEX 2D IVELOFMFNTS IN NORTH-SOUTH RELATIONS 1921-1972noted in Annex 1, the1,    As/Government of Ireland Act 1920 included provisions to establish a council of Ireland as a means to facilitate ultimate unity between the parliaments and Governments to be set up with equal powers and status, and both within the United Kingdom.2.   The Act duly came into force in May 1921, but the Parliament of southern ireland never effectively met, because of the massive swing of public opinion inthe South behind the much more radical separatist aims of Sinn.Fein.   As a result,the Southern membership of the Council of Ireland was never elected.p.The &quot;truce&quot; of July 1921 v/as followed by further discussions betv/een british representatives and the representatives of Sinn Fein, leading eventually to theconclusion of the Treaty which received parliamentary confirmation in the IrishFree State (Agreement) Act 1922.   This agreement granted dominion status  to thewhole of Ireland, but allowed to Northern Ireland the option (which was swiftlyexercised) of remaining outside the new Irish State and retaining the system ofgovernment established by the Act of 1920, including the provisions relating tothe Council of Ireland, slightly amended to take account of the constitutional changes in the South.   However, although the Parliament of Northern Irelandappointed its representatives to the Council as early as June^L921. the new parliament or Oireachtas of the Irish Free State never reciprocated.   Thus theCouncil did not function, and the matters specifically reserved to it by the act of 1920 were for a time exercised in Belfast by a United Kingdom official knownas the Imperial Secretary.^. The Treaty j^ad also provided for a Boundary Commission to consider adjustment of the border between North and South, taking account as far as possible of the
wishes of the inhabitants;   and there can be little doubt that the partiesto the agreement had somewhat different impressions of the likely outcome,apparentlywith the Irish representatives/ anticipating, or at least hoping for, such asubstantial contraction of Northern Ireland in terras of area and population athatits future viability   would be in question.   The establishment of the commission was attended by various difficulties, but eventually it carried out its work and completed its award under the Chairmanship of the South African judge s Mr JusticeFeetham.   The nature of the award (which transferred to the Irish Free State somecomparatively limited areas   of Northern Ireland, but which also transferred to northern Ireland less extensive areas of the Free State) was a grave disappointmentto the Dublin Government and in the event it was agreed between,the British,Northern Irish and Irish Free State Governments that the Report should not bepublished, but that the existing boundary should be re-affirmed.   This agreement(endorsed by the Ireland (Confirmation of Agreement) Act 1925) also pledged thetwo Irish Governments to a friendly and neighbourly relationship   to be underpinnedby regular cross-border meetings.5.   Unfortunately the expectations prompted by this agreement were not fulfilled,and in 193? there v/as promulgated     . a new Irish Constitution, which proclaimedthat the &quot;national territory&quot; consisted of the whole island of Ireland.   The&apos;   Irish Governmentgrowing tfulf between North and South was further accentuated when the/ chose toremain neutral, throughout the Second World War in which Northern Ireland was fully engaged, of its own choice, as a part of the United Kingdom.   In 19^+8 thatGovernment decided to sever its links with the Grown and commonwealth and to establish an Irish Republic.   In the subsequent United kingdom legislation made necessary by these developments (the Ireland Act 19^9) Parliamentaffirmed that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom, and that neither Northern Ireland as a whole nor any part thereof should cease to be partof the United Kingdom&apos; without the consent of the Northern Ireland Parliament.
6,   While the&apos; &quot;progressive withdrawal of what hqd been the Irish Free Statefrom its formal associations with the British Commonwealth and the Crowninevitably changed the nature of partition, this did not prevent in the post-war era the development of certain measures of practical co-operation betweenthe Governments in Ireland - as, for example, in the establishment pf theLough Foyle Fisheries Commission, the Erne drainage and hydro-electricity scheme,and joint action to save the Great Northern Railway.   In 1965 meetings tookofplace between the Prime minister of Northern Ireland and/the Irish Republicleading ,to a closer co-operation In tourist promotion and other areas and tothe establishment of an inter-connector between the two electricity systems.70   A more or less permanent irritant in the relationship between NorthernIreland and the Irish Republic was, of course, the&apos;periodic activity /of militantrepublican elements.   At its inception Northern Ireland had suffered the impact of a major terrorist campaign, and although it enjoyed thereafter   some prolongedperiods of more or less complete peace, the threat of renewed violence was felt to be ever present, and indeed become a reality at different times, as for example,between 1956 and 1962.   Frequently this activity took the form of armed raidsthroughoutacross the border, and the supreme directorate of the Irish Republican Army/was*based in the South.   Although firm action (including, for instance, the use of internment powers between 1957 and 196l)was from time to time taken in theRepublic, the IRA remained a continuing threat.8.   More recently, during the present&apos;period of troubles in Northern Ireland,the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic has consistently maintained thatunification is&apos;the ultimate, desirable solution for Ireland as a whole?   but thatthis cannot be achieved overnight, nor can its achievement be farthered by theactivities   of terrorists.   others  has nevertheless been considerable feeling
both within Northern Ireland land .throughout the rest of the United kingdom that there has been insufficient firm action within the Republic to control !endcontain terrorists who openly maintain headquarters in Dublin and who are, bytheir own admission, responsible for acts of murder and violence in NorthernIreland.   This has been compounded by allegations, (which evidence the Arms Trialsin Dublin in 1970 suggested might well be founded upon fact), that there have beeninstances in which members of the government machine in the Republic have activelyassisted the terrorist cause in the North.9.   Within the Republic, public opinion has often felt that the Northern ireland government were insufficiently sensitive to the grievances felt by the Catholicminority, and that this in itself created the atmosphere in which terrorists were able to operate.   While it has been widely accepted in the Republic that thesecurity situation warranted exceptional measures by the Administration in theNorth, there have been doubts expressed about the validity of internment, andconcern at certain stories which have regularly appeared in the Irish presspurporting to describe the activities of members of the British Army who are inHorthern Ireland to assist the civil power.   The misreporting of events atLondonderry on 30 January provoked public emotions in the Republic to the extent that the British Embassy in Dublin was attacked and destroyed,   The Irish Govern-at themerit also found it necessary to make certain allegations against the United Kingdom/European Commission of Human Rights concerning the activities of the authoritiesin Northern Ireland.   Certain of the allegations (including those relating toevents at Landonderry on 30 January) were rejected Iby the Commission on1 October 1972,,   Others were declared admissible within the terms of theConvention, without any prejudice to a verdict on their accuracy or validity,and can now be referred to a substantive hearing at a later date.
1.      A five-point reform programme was announced by the Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland on 22 November 1968.     Successive Northern Ireland governments have been firmly committed to the implementation of this programme and indeedexpanded it as time went on.      The initial proposals were:(i)   the substitution of a broadly-based Development commission for elected local government in the Londonderry area -implemented by the establishment of the LondonderryDevelopment Commission on 5 February 1969;(ii)   the future allocation of public authority housing ona points system - implemented on the basis of the modelpoints scheme referred to in the Commission of 29 August1969;(iii)   new methods of investigating citizens&apos; grievances -Implemented by the appointment of a. parliamentary commissioner for Administration and a Commissionerfor Complaints under two new Acts of Parliament which became law on 24 Juno 1969 and 25 November 1969respectively;    (the statutory limit of the parliamentary commissioner being subsequently extended to cover, inaddition to the functions discharged by his Westminstercounterpart, the investigation of natters of personneladministration;   and by arrangement to cover certain matters arising out of the anti-discrimination clause in Northern Ireland Government contracts).
(iv)   the abolition of the Business Vote at elections for Stormont,extended in March 1969 to include the substitution of universaladult suffrage for the ratepayers&apos; franchise at local government elections - implemented in the Electoral Lav/ Acts of 1968 and 1969;(v)   a promise to review the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Actand Regulations as soon as the situation permitted.2.     Further reforms followed.   The Northern Ireland Government accepted therecommendations of the Hunt Committee that the Royal Ulster Constabulary should become a normally unarmed force and that defence of Northern Ireland againstarmed terrorists should bo a military responsibility.   Thus a new structure forthe police force was embodied in the Police Act of 1970 and the Ulster special constabulary was replaced by the RUG Reserve established under that Act,   Inaddition the part-time Ulster Defence Regiment which was established by theUnited Kingdom Government to assist the Army in its security role becameoperational on 1 April 1970.3,     Provision for a central housing authority to be responsible for all public authority house building, management and allocation was made in the HousingExecutive Act which became law on 25 February 1971*4.    Following the decision to centralise housing responsibility a committee under the Chairmanship of Mr Patrick Macrory was set up to review the then existing plans for the reorganisation of local government.5o     In the context of local government reorganisation an interim StaffCommission was established in June 1970 on a non-statutory basis to assistcentral and local government with the complex staffing difficulties of reorganisation,   Provision for a permanent and statutory local government Staff
Commission was made in the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972.6,     The Ministry of Community Relations was established under legislation which became law on 28 October 1969*   Among other tilings the Ministry wascharged with the responsibility of obtaining declarations of equality ofemployment opportunity from public bodies and local authorities and of ensuring that the same employing authorities devolved and adopted acceptable codes ofemployment procedure.   In addition a Community Relations Commission wasappointed under the Community Relations Act (Northern Ireland) 19&amp;9.7.     The Northern Ireland G-overnment also made proposals for the reform of the.... ^ ..Stormont Parliament.   On 22 June 1971 Mr Faulkner, then Prime Minister,announced that the Government intended to recommend to Parliament a new committee system.   In addition to the Public Accounts Committee there would be three new functional committees covering respectively the fields of social services, environmental services and industrial services.   It was intended that the committees should be representative of party strength in the House andthat members of the Opposition should chair at least two.   These proposals were later incorporated in a Green Paper on the Future Development of the parliament and Government of Northern Ireland published in October 1971(Cmd 560 of 1971) which canvassed among other things the possibility of introducing Proportional Representation of increasing the size of the House ofCommons and of widening the basis of the Senate^   They were taken a stage further in correspondence between the government of Northern Ireland and theUnited. Kingdom, referred to in the Northeim Ireland Government&apos;s Y/hite Paper&quot;Political Settlement&quot; (Cmd 568 of 1972).
