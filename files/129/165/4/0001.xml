(US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^&apos; government cp(72) 104 COPY NO12 October 1972CABINET651973 REVALUATION FOR RATESMemorandum by the Secretary of State forthe environment. When we discussed the 1973 Revaluation for Rates(CM(72) 44th Conclusions, Minute 5) we agreed to consider further theextent to which local authorities could be induced to conform withmeasures of price restraint, the public presentation of revaluation andthe simple reassurances which could be given to ratepayers.2. A separate paper (CP(72) 105) gives a preliminary appraisal of thepossibilities of restraining growth in rates in 1973 through themachinery of rate support grant.    It is not possible to ensure that nolocal authority will exceed any specific rate of increase in rate poundagenor that, as a result of revaluation, no rate bill of any ratepayer will exceed such a limit.    However, in the rate support grant order for thelast two years we were tougher than our predecessors and halved the rateof increase in grant percentage they had established.    Moreover, nextyear local authorities will still be bearing extra costs from the counter-cyclical activities which we have urged upon them.    For these reasonsa more generous grant settlement than last time could be justified.    Thiswould certainly lead to lower rates than would otherwise occur and wouldmake it possible to bring pressure on local authorities to restrain thegrowth in rates and not to use revaluation as an occasion to increase income.I would make this point very strongly when I meet the Local authority associations for the final rate support grant negotiations on 20 November.3. It would be unrealistic to expect significant savings in localauthority expenditure in 1973-74.    Substantial change would require legislation and could not occur before reorganisation in April 1974.    Ibelieve that we should seek to make a large reduction in local authority expenditure then, but not by further transfer of services.    We are already taking away local health services and water and sewerage services, and totake more away would be incompatible withogaS public commitment tostronger local government.1
4. The laying of the regulations relating to the electricity industry,which are technical, may lead to little comment. I suggest that the aim should be to avoid publicity as far as possible at this time. However,if there should be adverse comment or wild speculation, I would proposeto reassure by explanation that revaluation need not mean increased rateburdens, to announce our intention to be generous with grant and to hint,so far as I am able, at further measures in prospect for the relief of ratesin forthcoming legislation.5. The main, and if possible the sole, publicity campaign by press conference and television appearance, should, I propose, be associatedwith the publication of the new valuation lists in December when individualratepayers will see their new rateable values.    It should be possible then to point to a generous settlement of grant which has been made and toassurances of restraint which have been obtained from local authority associations.    The Local Government Finance Bill should have been introduced and will include measures for relief of rates including an extended system of rate rebates.6. I invite Cabinet -a. to agree that we proceed with revaluation 1973 and thatthe electricity order should be laid;b. to agree that there should be a more generous rate support grant settlement for 1973-74 than last time;c. to agree that some means, other than further transfers of services, should be sought to reduce local authority expenditure from April 1974;d. to approve ray proposals for publicity for the 1973revaluation for rates.P w department of the Environment12 October 19722
