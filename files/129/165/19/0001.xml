RATE SUPPORT GRANT NEGOTIATIONSI/emorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. Following the discussion in Cabinet on 2 November (CM(72) 48thConclusions, Minute 6) the issues have been further discussed with theChief Secretary, and the Department of Education and Science.    TheChief Secretary and I are in full agreement that, in the coming stages of the negotiations about rate support grant for 1973-74, we should openlyinvite the co-operation of the local authorities in policies designed to restrain the growth in the rates, that we should declare our willingness to help in this by a more generous attitude on rate support grant than inthe last settlement, and that at the same time we should impress upon thelocal authorities the need to play their part by moderating the growth in expenditure in 1973-74.    We should also draw attention to the problempresented by the rising trend in expenditure over subsequent years, but,so far as the local authorities are concerned, this would have to befollowed up in separate consultations;   so far as the Chief secretary is concerned, since the public expenditure decisions which now haveto be taken affect the whole period of up to 1976-77, he will naturallywish to pursue in that context the policy issues involved in bringing the trend in local authority expenditure back on to course.2. There is at present a gap of some  60- 70 million between thetotal of relevant expenditure for 1973-74 which the spending Departmentsthink must be accepted as compared with the figure which wouldcorrespond exactly with the existing Public Expenditure survey committee (PESC) provision.    Even so, these Departmental forecasts are significantly less than the local authority associations have proposed.Therefore, to start with, I have to reconcile them to coming down to ourforecasts.    But on top of this I have given the Chief Secretary an under-taking that I will seek to negotiate a further reduction of  25 million in thelocal authority bid.    But I can give no prior assurance of success in this attempt and the Chief Secretary has accepted that, if I am later obliged toreport that this  25 million cannot be secured, he will then be prepared to forgo this further reduction.    This would mean that the total of relevant expenditure for England and Wales for 1973-74 would be  4,934 million atJune 1972 prices.    In that event the Chief Secretary would consider it allCP(72)119 COPY NO       637 November 1972CABINET
the more essential to work out measures to prevent this substantial excess over the PESC provision from continuing in subsequent years also.3. On the rate of grant, I consider that I should be in a position to offer60 per cent in the negotiations.    The Chief Secretary, while agreeing thatthe outcome must be in the range of 59-60 per cent, has been reluctant toaccept at this stage that we should go as far as 60 per cent, on the grounds that, though there is inevitably uncertainty about the implications for ratesof any particular grant percentage it seems likely that a 591&apos; per centgrant - an increase of 1^- per cent over the existing percentage - wouldbe enough to enable local authorities to keep the increase in both domestic and non-domestic rates in 1973-74 pretty close to 5 per cent.    He is naturally concerned with the fact that every half per cent on the rateof grant adds  25- 30 million to the financing problems of the Exchequer.4. For my part, I feel that to offer a grant of 59i per cent rather than60 per cent would spoil the psychological effect of our proposals.Moreover for the sake of \ per cent of grant it is running the riskof not getting down to 5 per cent.    However, I am prepared to negotiate with the associations to determine a level of grant not exceeding 60 per cent which could be expected to keep the average rise in rates to about 5 percent.    I will seek to do so at 59^ per cent, but if I have to offer the full60 per cent the Chief Secretary will be prepared to accept that.G r department of the Environment7 November 19722
