IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 114 COPY NO 6430 October 1972CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT 1973-74Note by the Secretary of State for the environment, In CP(72) 105, I gave a preliminary appraisal of the problemslikely to arise in the forthcoming rate support grant negotiations.    Thiswas based on the outturn of local authority current expenditure in 1971-72.I now attach an interdepartmental note by officials containing a revisedappraisal based on the preliminary discussions with officials of the localauthority associations.2. The earlier paper noted that expenditure in 1971-72 had been slightly higher than forecast in the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC)report.    This implied that the outcome of the rate support negotiations might be a forecast for 1973-74 some  20- 40 million above the presentPESC provision of  3,935 million, with similar increases in later years.The present paper suggests that the outturn may now lie nearly  80 millionabove the PESC figures.    The main reasons for this increase are under-estimates in 1970 of the cost of providing services, and in particulareducation.3. I do not know of any policy changes which would take effect quicklyenough to reduce expenditure substantially in 1973-74.    We must negotiatetightly but in my view we cannot deny to the authorities s some of theimprovement of services which they will argue is implied by the policieswe have urged upon them.    I suggest that a realistic target for ournegotiation would be a relevant expenditure in 1973-74 at June 1972prices of  4, 934 million.    To impose an arbitrary cut on this, asproposed by Treasury officials, would cast doubt on our policy onrate levels because a settlement at less than the realistic cost ofthe policies which we expect authorities to follow could mean thatactual expenditure would exceed the forecast and authorities wouldhave to make up any shortfall on grant by higher rates.    I therefore seek the agreement of my colleagues to negotiate within a margin of 10 million above  4, 934 million.    This would imply expenditure inPESC terms in 1973-74 of  67 million to  77 million above the presentPESC provision and a rate of growth between 1971-72 and 1973-74 at anannual rate of 5.1 per cent compared with 45 per cent in the PESC report.
4, A projection of the policies consistent with these figures for 1973-74would however produce total expenditure in 1976-77  74 million above PESC.&quot;We shall need to consider the implications of this in the context of all theother demands on public expenditure.    Moreover, in addition to settlinggrant for the one year 1973-74 we shall be expected to indicate provisionallythe levels of expenditure which may be appropriate for the next two yearsand I propose that we should tell the associations that the implications of continuing growth at the rates implied by the present forecast are unlikely to be acceptable and that we shall therefore be seeking how best to reducethe rate of growth,IMPLICATIONS FOR RATES5. If grant was held at the present rate of 58 per cent of  4, 934 million in June 1972 prices, it could be expected to lead to an increase of average rate poundages in 1973-74 of 12.5 per cent.    With the existing domesticreduction of 10fp, domestic poundages would rise by 16. 3 per cent feiterallowing for a 2 per cent shift of rates from non-domestic properties asa result of revaluation).    By increasing the domestic element to 19p (say7fp after revaluation) and the rate of grant to 60 per cent the rise in average domestic rates could be held down to about 7 per cent.    Thisshould be sufficient to enable us to say that we had made a generoussettlement and that by and large the increase in rate payment shouldnot be out of line with the outcome of the tripartite discussions,conclusions. I invite my colleagues to agree that:i. I should seek to reach agreement on a figure of relevant expenditure for rate support grant for 1973-74 of  4, 934 million at June 1972 prices but that I should have discretion to exceed thisby not more than  10 million,ii. I should inform the associations that I would be seeking toreduce rates of growth in subsequent years,iii. The increase in grant should be concentrated on domestic rate payers rather than spread over the whole field;  the rate of grant should be fixed at 60 per cent and the adjustment of domestic rates at 7-fp on the new values.P w department of the Environment30 October 1972
ANNEXRATE SUPPORT GRANT NEGOTIATIONS 1972Second Note by officials.    In the first report (annexed to CP(72)105) we drew attention tothe outturn of local authority current expenditure in 1971-72 and tothe likely implications for the forthcoming rate support grant negotiations and for rate levels in 1973-74-2.   We have now completed the first round of discussions with thelocal authority associations,  in the light of forecasts of expenditurein 1973-74* 1974-75 and 1975-76, assuming continuation of present policies, prepared for each of the five main groups of services by working groups of officials of Departments and local authorities.3.   Generally there was a broad measure of agreement between the tx^osides on the forecasts of the expenditure that would arise with nochange in policy or, in some cases, with no change in the establishedtrends.    But in a few cases, Departments envisaged slightly lowerfigures than the local authorities considered realistic.    the associations have now submitted their bids of the levels of expenditure which they would consider appropriate in the light of the demands upon them for the improvement of services.4.   The main issues are discussed in Appendix 1 , but in summary, theposition is as follows:IMPLICATIONS FOR PESC5.    The figures in para 4 above are in rabe support grant terms.As previously explained, they need to be adjusted in content and in price basis to make them consistent with the PESC report.    Althoughthe year 1976-77 lies beyond the range of the negotiations the implications for that year of the three sets of figures have alsobeen worked out;6.   Appendix 2 gives a detailed comparison of the figures for each department, but in summary the position is:1973-74 Forecast(June 1972 Prices) finDepartmental ForecastsLocal Authority ProposalsDifference4934496834

The level foreseen for 1976/77 represents a significant additionto the rate of increase (from 197V72) foreseen in the PESC report and would add significantly to the problems already raced by ministers in implementing the Cabinefs objective for public expenditure.Ministers will therefore no doubt wish to consider what policy stepscan be taken to reduce growth up to 1976/77 to that foreseen in the survey.   We understand that Treasury Ministers have already invitedthose of their colleagues concerned to undertake this consideration.In addition, it is necessary to consider what can be done to influencelocal expenditure in 1973/74* the base upon which further growth to1976/77 will take place.    The scope here is clearly limited.    Theposition is also complicated by the Governments desire, in order to restrain the increase in rates, for a more generous RSG- settlementthan in the previous years, since restriction of grant is an importantmeans of influencing local expenditure decisions.   We think however,that advantage can be taken of the Government&apos;s intention to be more generous on the percentage of grant to ask for the local authorities&apos;co-operation in restraint of the actual expenditure to x^hich it willattach.    Proceeding on these lines would point to the Governmentbasing itself on the Departmental forecasts of relevant expenditure(less any consequentials in 1973/74 of any further policy measures designed to deal with the excess foreseen in 1976/77) and asking localauthorities to match the Government&apos;s generosity on the percentage of.grant by exercising the greatest possible restraint.8.    It would be essential, however, for a general exhortation of this nature to be accompanied subsequently by restraint on the part of central government from encouraging local authorities to spend more on individual services.9.   This is common ground between officials.-   The issue on which weare not agreed is whether this restraint should be translated into a specific figure which would be deducted from the level of expenditureon which grant would be given.    The Treasury think that localauthorities should be asked to make savings of  30 million on thelevel referred to.    This saving would reduce the base from whichsubsequent growth would take place and should therefore be reflectedthroughout the Survey period.    It should also be reflected by an adjustment for each of the services concerned.    The Treasury.thinks that.the Government&apos;s intended generosity on rate support grant,justifies asking local government to play its part in holding rates down
by seeking the maximum economy which can be obtained by the exerciseof local discretion and by reinforcing the efforts which are already being made to improve the effectiveness of their organisation inrelation to its cost.    The DOE and other Departments, however,consider that experience on previous occasions has shown that an arbitrary reduction in local government expenditure is ineffectivewhen it is imposed on forecasts which reflect the realistic cost ofthe policies which are being urged on local authorities.    A cut ofthis nature will be seen by the local authorities as merely reducingthe extent of the Governments generosity on the grant and is unlikely in the event to be reflected in corresponding reductions in actual expenditure.10.    The revision of the forecast of expenditure and the latest estimates of the rate of inflation mean that if the rate of grantwere unaltered, domestic rate poundages would tend to rise by   16.0per cent and the non-domestic rate burden by   10..^   per cent (after allowing for the effects of revaluation, which will tend to marginallyincrease the domestic ratepayer&apos;s share of the total).    These figuresallow for the expected burden on the rate fund in 1973/7^4- of trading services such as housing, which are not part of relevant expenditure.11.    Ministers have already agreed that the grant settlement shouldbe more generous than in 1970 and should have regard to the trypartite discussions with the CBI and TUC (without, however, being tied to aparticular figure).    The following table shows the effect on domesticrates, of changes in the rate of grants.

12.    The table shows that an increase in the grant percentage of1 per cent (as was the practice before 1970) to 59 per cent could reduce the prospective increase of domestic rates to either   12.0per cent or    II4..O    per cent depending on whether the benefit wasgiven to domestic ratepayers only or spread over all ratepayers.To bring the increase in rates down to 5 per cent would require separately of grant of either   60.5   per cent or about   63   per centaccording to the spread of relief as above.13.    In deciding whether to concentrate relief on domestic ratepayersor extend it also to non-domestic ratepayers, Ministers will x^ishto bear in mind on the one hand that rates are an industrial costand that the CBI have drawn this to attention in the tripartite talks,and on the other hand, that to spread relief over the whole fieldroughly doubles the cost to the central government.Hi..    Appendix 3* prepared by DOE, sets out the details of the calculations.

(CONFIDENfJALDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND science .     The local authority associations have claimed an increasein the the improvment factor in non-teaching costs in schools and further education from the yk% proposed in the EducationSub-group&apos;s report  (which the association consider inadequate) tobjjfo -  The associations point to the higher outturn in 1971-72as evidence in support of their claim.    The Department&apos;s view ison the contrary that after the generous treatment of improvementfactors in the 1970 settlement (when 3is% was allowed for 1971-72and yfo for 1972-73) a continuation at 3% would be enough in1973-74-    The associations1 claim would, increase expenditure  (at30 June prices) by  6.0m in 1973-74 (28.8m in 1976-77).    TheDepartment&apos;s proposal would reduce it by  6.0m in 1973-74 ( 17.7min 1976-77).2.     The associations have also claimed that expenditure on school meals should, be increased by  1.1m in 1973-74 ( 1m in1976-77) on the grounds that the estimate of the number of freemeals to be provided is too low; and that expenditure on librariesshould rise by       annually from 1973-74 onwards  (compared with h.%in the Sub-group&apos;s report) thus increasing the forecasts by  0.bmin that year ( 3.1m in 1976-77).    The Department does not accept that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate either of these claims.3.     The Department also considers that the Sub-group&apos;s forecasts of expenditure on advanced further education are too high becausethey make no allowance for the effect of the Pooling Committee&apos;srecommendations (accepted by the associations) for more stringentstaff-student ratios and for the observed shift in the balance of subjects from the more expensive science and technology to the cheaper arts, and social sciences.   After allowing for the associations contention that the Pooling Committee&apos;s recommendationscannot be given much effect as early as 1973-74* the Departmentsconclusion is that expenditure should be reduced by  1m in 1973-74and  10m in 1976-77.4.     After the reductions indicated above the Department considersthat the Sub-group&apos;s forecasts for 1973-74 are a realistic estimateof the cost of maintaining existing policies and do not otherwiseprovide for any deliberate improvement in standards or coverage.The amount by which they exceed the PESC forecasts is a properreflection of the fact that the 1971-72 outturn was higher than expected and that for a number of lines of expenditure new and more accurate forecasting methods have been introduced.    These factors,in combination, should make for a closer concordance betweenforecasts and outturn.

The forecastreflects rapidly increasing needs for social work staff and growing pressures to meet demands brought about by legislationrelated to the elderly and to the disabled, such as the ChronicallySick and Disabled Persons Act, 1970, and the Health Services andPublic Health Act, 1968.    The Authorities&apos; forecast includes an overall, unallocated sum of  10 million to help meet these pressures,DHSS accepts generally the case for increases in staff, particularlysocial workers, but does not consider that the expansion in other areas is wholly attainable in 1973/7lfJ and it rejects the idea ofan unallocated sum of  10 million, preferring to base its proposals on the needs of each part of the service.(confidential)
(confidential)HOME OFFICE SERVICESThere is very little difference betx^een the Home Office estimates and those of officiala.of the local authority associations.    the lowest reasonable estimate for 1973/714-* based on existing policyand trends, is just under  li96m in RSG terms at June 1972 prices,and the highest is  lj.98 .iim.    The lox^er figure is based on anassumed groxvth of police manpower of 3*500 over the previous year,which the local authorities consider reasonable, but the HomeOffice consider the estimates should be based on an increase oflj.,000.    The lower figure also provides for less probation officers(50) than the forecast of the Home Office.    (The police andprobation services are aided by specific grants and, because ofthe effect of specific grants on the rate support grant distribution, thelocal authorities tend to try to keep the estimates for specificgrant services as low as possible.)    Based on the lower manpowerfigures for police and probation officers the local authority bidis  Jj.97&apos;3m; on the higher manpower figures for police and probation,and with appropriate pruning in other services, the Home Officeconsider the figure should be about  ii98m.
(cEmuDOE (HIGHWAYS)Departmental and local authority forecasts differ for the cost ofmaintenance of roads.    The local authorities consider that thedepartmental forecast includes an inadequate allowance for the implementation of the Marshall Committee Report, which recommendedhigher standards of road maintenance.    The departmental figuresreflect the maximum which, the department consider feasible; localauthority manpower is at present engaged on bringing trunk road maintenance to Marshall standards and will be so engaged during1973*    It therefore seems improbable that local authorities willbe able to start on their own roads as early or intensively as is envisaged in their figures.    The local authorities however believethat resouces will be available, partly because of an increasedintake of staff for infrastructure work.   Within relevant expenditure, the tota.1 figure for maintenance suggested by thedepartment was  205m and includes an allowance of  10m for Marshall.The local authority figures allow  20m for Marshall and assumed that this work will represent about 10$ of normal maintenance.This percentage may well be valid for 1 974-5 arK* 1975-6, but becauseof the trunk road work is, in the department&apos;s view, unlikely to bereached in 1973-4.
DOB MISCELLANEOUSThe sub-group report suggested a possible range of forecasts totalling between 773.8m and  79^.*fm.     Having considered the views expressed by Associationrepresentatives, the Department now accepts their forecasts on all but one ofthe services within this heading, and proposes a revised forecast (on the basisused by the   sub-group) of  790.8.The remaining difference is on Town and Country Planning.     The local authoritiescontend for an annual growth rate of 125o in net expenditure, concentrated largely on extra staffing and related costs, and operating in 1972-73 and later years.The Department does not accept as realistic cumulative growth at such a rate andprefers its own assumption of 9.2/6 cumulative growth.     But it concedes that thetherate of growth for 1972-73 assumed in  teSXxSgKEBxiH earlier forecast wasuhrealistically low and should be increased to 9*2$.     This would lead to a forecast for 1973-7^ of  2m over the sub-group&apos;s minimum, as against the  5.6m.more which the associations are seeking.Price BasisRe-examination of the data upon which the forecasts were based has convinced the Department that in repricing to June 1972 levels an under-valuation bybetween 1%% and 2^ had taken place and a correction is required if the forecast of expenditure on all the DOE Miscellaneous services is not to be understated^A provisional sum of  l6.5m. has been added to the forecast to allow for this,making a revised forecast of  807.3 m.     But the discrepancy is still beinganalysed and it may be that not all of this provision will be required.

APPENDIX 3CALCULATION OF IMPACT ON RATESRate estimates include provision for some expenditure not relevant for rate support grant. After adjusting for these, including an allowance for somebenefits from the effect of the Housing Finance Act, the proposed settlementof relevant expenditure implies an increase over 1972-73 at constant pricesof about 6.7%. Authorities may also tend to over-rate to allow for the uncertainty produced by revaluation, but on the other hand, there v/ill be atendency to run-down balances.2.     Each authority v/ill have to decide for itself what provision to make inits rate estimate for inflation, but they will no doubt have in mind that evenif pay increase are limited in accordance with the outcome of the trypartite discussions, this will still represent a substantial increase in their salaryand wages bill.     It seems unlikely that authorities as a whole will providefor less than      inflation in their rate estimates.3.     On balance therefore, it would not be unreasonable to look for an increasein rate estimates in 1973-7^ of about 14.7$i which would be partially off-set bythe tendency of rateable value at constant prices to increase by 2.2?o p.a.Thus, if no change were made in the percentage of relevant expenditure met fromgrant, average rate burdens might be expected to increase by 12.5/-J.4.    The impact on the domestic ratepayer would&apos;be somewhat larger than this for two reasons:(i)   due to the 10jp domestic rate reduction, percentage increases in domestic rates are measiired from a lower base;(ii)   the effect of revaluation of properties in April 1963 which will alter the distribution of rateable value as between domestic and non-domesticproperties by about 1$ - i.e. given the same total rate burden, domestic rate payers as a whole stand to pay 2$ more rates than before.Allowing for these factors, average domestic rates would increase by about 16.3%while non-domestic rates would increase by 1005?o.5.    Relevant expenditure at outturn prices, allowing for 8% pay and pricesincreases, would be about  5^70m.     Rateable values at 1 April 1973 are likelyto be:
 m(Present Values) (New Values)Domestic 1298 3203Non-domestic 1177 3020TOTAL 2^75 6223Thus each additional      step in the rate of grant will cost  27.3m and will,if applied generally reduce rates by about 1.1$.     If applied solely to domesticelement it would reduce domestic rates by about 2.3$ (requiring an increase inthe domestic adjustment of 2.1p on present values or .0.85p after revaluation).
