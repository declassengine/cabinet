CP(72) 117 COPY NO       326 November 1972CABINETINFLATION (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) bill note by the Chancellor of the exchequer. I circulate herewith, for the information of the Cabinet,proof copies of the White Paper comprising the draft Bill and theaccompanying White Paper explaining the main issues of policy involved, in the form in which they will be published this afternoonconcurrently with the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.2. Since it was essential to have the Bill and the White Paperready for printing by noon on Sunday, the Ministers principally concerned met during Saturday in order to consider the final texts.There is one development which I should report to the Cabinet.    a tour meeting last Friday we decided to delete the Clause dealing withthe treatment of Existing Contracts of Employment.    When we went into the matter more fully on Saturday we found that it was essentialto the whole operation of the standstill to include a Clause which dealtwith this matter.    We have found a means of doing this, in the new clause 3, without, I believe, the embarrassment of the earlier version.3. For reasons which I am sure my colleagues will understand,it was not possible to clear this with all members of the Cabinet;but it has the concurrence of the Prime Minister   and the ministers directly concerned.A treasury Chambers6 November 1972
A Programme for ControllingInflation: The First StagePresented to Parliament by the Chancellor of the exchequer by Command of Her majesty november 1972LONDONHER MAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICE13p netDRAFT BILL. 5200
Inflation (Temporary Provisions) BillEXPLANATORY memorandum the Bill empowers the Government to apply a standstill inprices, charges for services, pay, dividends and rents by forbid-ding any increase above the level prevailing before 6th Novemberor, in the case of dividends, by forbidding the declaration of adividend in excess of a corresponding dividend declared in theprevious calendar year. The Bill would enable the implement a-tion of the policy outlined in the White Paper &quot; A programme for Controlling Inflation: the First Stage &quot; (Cmnd. 5125).Clause 1 provides that the standstill is to end at the expiration of ninety days from the passing of the Bill unless an Order inCouncil is made extending the period by a further period, notexceeding sixty days.Clause 2 enables the appropriate Minister by order or notice to apply the standstill to any prices for the sale of goods,charges for the performance of services, remuneration undercontracts of employment, dividends declared by companiesincorporated in the United Kingdom and rents. Provision ismade for authorising what would otherwise be a contravention of the standstill if the order or notice so provides or a Ministergives his consent.Clause 3 modifies the terms of certain contracts made before6th November which provide for increases in remunerationduring the standstill. The effect of the modification is that therate of remuneration payable during the standstill is not to exceed the highest rate payable under the contract (for the same kind of work) before 6th November.Clause 4 enables Ministers to require the furnishing of in-formation and Clause 5 makes provision as respects offencesunder the Bill.The Schedule contains provisions supplementing the mainclauses.Paragraph 1 describes the ancillary matters for which an order or notice under Clause 2 may provide.Paragraph 2 empowers the appropriate Minister by order to prescribe the extent to which anything affected by Clause 2 isto be invalid either during or after the continuance in forceof that clause.
Paragraph 4 provides that the Bill and any provision madeunder the Bill is to prevail over any conflicting enactment; it also empowers the appropriate Minister by order to provide that any existing enactment relating to prices, charges, remunera-tion, dividends or rents shall, while Clause 2 is in force, haveeffect subject to such modifications as may be specified in theorder.Paragraph 6 requires orders under the Bill to be containedin a statutory instrument subject to annulment by either Houseof Parliament.Paragraph 8 contains provisions as respects Crown servants.Financial Effects of the bill the additional cost to departments arising directly under theprovisions of the Bill will be marginal.Effects of the Bill on Public Service ManpowerSo far as can be anticipated the effect of the Bill on publicservice manpower is likely to be minimal.

A Programme for ControllingInflation: The First StagePresented to Parliament by the Chancellor of the exchequer by Command of Her majesty november 1972LONDONHER MAJESTVS STATIONERY OFFICE8p net cmnd. 5125
A PROGRAMME FOR CONTROLLING INFLATION:THE FIRST STAGE1. Since July the Government has had a series of meetings with the cbi and the TUC on the objectives of economic management and onthe methods by which those objectives should be pursued over the next 12months. The agreed objectives were: faster growth in national output andreal incomes, an improvement in the relative position of the low paid andmoderation in the rate of cost and price inflation. The Government putforward proposals for achieving these objectives on 26th September, but it became clear on 2nd November that it was not possible to reach agreement.2. The Prime Minister announced in a statement to the House ofCommons on 6th November that the Government had concluded that it wasnecessary, in the absence of agreement, to bring in statutory measures andthat, because the main legislation would take time, there would be a standstillfor an interim period on increases in prices, rents, dividends and pay withimmediate effect. An interim Bill, the draft text of which is being published as a separate White Paper (Cmnd. 5200), will be introduced to give Ministerspower to enforce the standstill. The Bill will provide that these powers should run for 90 days from enactment in the first instance but that they can beextended by affirmative resolution order for up to a further 60 days to ensurethat the standstill lasts until the main legislation receives the Royal Assent.This White Paper describes how the standstill is to be applied during thisinterim period.Prices and Charges3. The standstill applies to prices and charges for goods and servicessupplied to the home market whether provided by the private or the public sector. Increases which have been announced but not implemented beforethe standstill should not take place.4. The Government recognises that the imposition of a standstill will present problems for some enterprises, notably for those members of the cbi and the nationalised industries which have already observed a 15-month period of price restraint. However, enterprises will be required to absorbcost increases to the maximum extent possible. Cost reduction should be fully reflected in prices.5. Enterprises which consider that their costs (either import costs ordomestic costs) have risen so far that it is impracticable for them to be absorbed will need to submit details of proposed price increases to the relevant Government Department and obtain its consent, or run the risk of having price increases reversed by notice or order under the interim legislation.Such proposals will be strictly scrutinised. Agreement will not normally begiven except where increased costs cannot be absorbed by increased produc-tivity or a temporary reduction in profit margin ; such exceptions will generally be confined to cases where raw materials or raw agricultural produce account for a high proportion of total costs.
6. Wholesalers and retailers are expected to do everything possible toavoid any increases in prices ; in particular they should not increase theircash margins during the standstill. They will not be required to apply to departments before changing prices for goods for which they have had to pay more. But they are not on that account exempted from the principles of the standstill and will be subject to the same control as other enterprises if theyraise prices unjustifiably.7. Certain prices especially those for fresh food such as fruit, vegetables,meat and fish and for imported raw materials are subject to fluctuationsarising from external or seasonal causes. Where such prices rise, enterpriseshandling these products without applying any manufacturing process tothem will not be required to obtain specific consent for raising their prices by the same amount. Increases beyond this will be subject to the controlsprovided in the Bill. Where there are price reductions, enterprises will beexpected to pass them on in full.8. The Government intend that the principles of the standstill shallapply to the prices of the nationalised industries, and to central Governmentfees and charges.9. Prices determined by bodies such as the Traffic Commissioners andthe Civil Aviation Authority will be subject to the standstill.Employment Incomes10. The standstill applies to all increases in pay and to other improve-ments in the terms and conditions of employment, e.g., hours and holidays,though not to occupational pensions. All concerned in the determination of pay and other conditions of employment in both the public and private sectors, whether at industry, company or plant level, will be subject to therequirements of the standstill. Arbitrators, independent review bodies and statutory wage fixing bodies are expected to take account of the standstill.11. The term &quot;pay&quot; covers all rates of pay. In addition to the basic rate, this includes rates of pay for overtime or weekend work, piece rates andall allowances which are normally considered as pay.12. The standstill will not apply to increases in earnings resulting directly from extra effort or output under existing arrangements, e.g., increases inpiece-work earnings stemming from increased output. Nor will it apply to increases arising from genuine promotion. Where the existing pay is expressed in terms of ranges or scales they should not be increased. the standstill will not of course apply to direct reimbursement of expenditure incurred, e.g., for travel and subsistence.Existing agreements13. In all cases where a settlement was reached before the standstill,and the operative date of the increase was on or before 6th November,the increase can be implemented.
14. However, there will be some agreements made before the standstillwhich provide for specified increases in pay or improvements in other con-ditions to take effect from an operative date falling within the period of the standstill. The operative date of such increases will be deferred until the standstill comes tto an end. Included in this category are any increases whichmay fall due during the standstill under existing cost of living sliding scalearrangements.Wages Councils and Boards15. Proposals from Wages Councils and Boards made on or before 6thNovember may be implemented if the operative date of the last increase was ait least 12 months before the standstill.Arbitration Awards16. Arbitration awards may be implemented during the standstill ifthe relevant hearings were completed on or before 6th November and the operative date was not later than that date.Deferred increases17. Apart from the cases in paragraphs 13, 15 and 16 above, wherepayment is permitted during the standstill, the implementation of pay increases or improvements in conditions negotiated or submitted to arbitrationbefore the standstill is deferred until the end of the standstill.Negotiation and arbitration during the standstill18. If negotiations or arbitrations take place during the standstill any increase resulting from an agreement should not take effect before the endof the standstill period and will in any case be subject to the policy whichis in operation after the standstill period.Other employment incomes19. Many individual salaries and other forms of remuneration are not determined through collective bargaining. The standstill will apply to theseforms of employment income. It will apply also to charges and fees(including all forms of professional fees) for services by self-employed persons.Rates20. The Government will consult the local authorities in the forth-coming rate support grant discussions with a view to moderating the rateof growth of local rates.Rents21. The rents charged by local authorities and new towns are governed by the Housing Finance Act 1972 and the corresponding Scottish Act.Under these Acts the tenants of these authorities are covered by rebateschemes from 1st October, 1972, and certain authorities were required toincrease the rent of their dwellings for 1972-73 in October 1972. as these rent increases were due to take place before the standstill they arenot affected by it and any authorities who have not so far dischargedthis statutory obligation will not be relieved of it by the standstill.
22. About half of the tenants of private unfurnished accommodationare at present subject to rent control. Some of them are due to move from control to regulation on 1st January, 1973, and to be liable to have their rent increased if a fair rent is subsequently registered for theirdwelling. This date will be postponed to the end of the standstill period.For those private tenants whose rent is regulated and who are thus alreadywithin the fair rent system, and for tenants of housing associations whocome within that system on 1st January 1973, any fair rent registeredduring the standstill which is higher than the existing rent will not take effect until the end of the standstill.23. The rent of business premises and land has a direct effect on theprice of many goods and services, and unlike housing rents these rents are subject neither to statutory controls nor to rebate provisions. They will besubject to the standstill provisions.Dividends24. The standstill will apply to dividends declared by companiesincorporated in the United Kingdom. During the standstill period companies will be required not to declare dividends (whether final or interim) in excessof the corresponding amount in the same calendar period a year ago. Becauseof their special character the standstill will not be applied to dividendsdeclared by investment trusts or to certain companies such as close companies to the extent that they increase distributions in order to comply with thespecial tax rules. The Treasury will be issuing further explanatory guidance to assist companies.The Powers25. In support of the standstill, the Bill (which applies throughout theUnited Kingdom) will give Ministers powers to make orders or issue noticesdirecting that incomes or prices and charges should not exceed the levelsprevailing before 6th November. This will enable unjustified increases whichtake place during the standstill period to be reversed. The Bill will also provide for fines in cases where an individual or firm fails to comply witha direction to reduce incomes, prices, charges or dividends and where anyonetakes action designed to force an increase to be made which would be contrary to an order.26. The Bill will give the Ministers concerned discretion to defer forthe duration of the standstill the effective dates of wages regulation orders made under the Wages Councils Act and the Agricultural Wages Act.27. The Bill will enable orders or notices to be made to prohibit a company from declaring a dividend higher than the corresponding dividendpaid in the same calendar period in the previous year. The Bill will providepowers to make orders to prevent increases in rents above the level payablebefore 6 th November.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office3135631   Dd.
