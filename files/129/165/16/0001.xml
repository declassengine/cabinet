THIS  DOCUMENT   IS   THE PROPERTY OF HER   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of .^&amp;w^..V.^M^VsO-(;.TOP secret copy No. .3.1.........CP(72) 1163 November 1972CABINETINFLATION (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) bill note by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord President of the council, I was asked to eo-ordinate the preparation of this Bill,    (Thelatest print is annexed).    When considering it my colleagues may find the following brief explanation of some difficult aspects helpful.2,        In essence, the standstill provides a simple and draconian methodof buying time to implement our longer-term policy.3. We believe the standstill will work most effectively if people are asked to implement it voluntarily.    But they will only do so if they are convinced that others will.    The Bill accordingly confers powers to make orders or notices prohibiting increases in contravention of the standstill.But we must still rely mainly on the force of public opinion.4.        If the Bill is too complicated it will in my judgment attract much less public support than a simple, easily understood measure.    We must therefore be prepared to accept that there will be some hard cases andsome which slip through the net.    But it is important that there are not too many striking and well-reported breaches of the standstill.5. The public will, however, expect the standstill to cover dividendsand rents as well as prices and incomes. If it does not do so much public support will be lost.RENTS6. Provision for rents does, however, present some difficulties.    Inparticular, Clause 3, which is deliberately drafted very simply, is wide enough to allow the Secretary of State to order local authorities, in effect,to continue defaulting on the housing financial legislation.    Naturally hewould not use his power in this way.    It is stated clearly in paragraph 13of the draft White Paper that the standstill will not relieve theserecalcitrant authorities of their obligations.
AUTHORISATION OF BREACHES OF AGREEMENTS7.        My colleagues will wish to give especial consideration to Clause 4.The Clause is intended to authorise breaches of contracts made before the standstill but due to be implemented during it (including staged agreements).But it is proposed to permit increments (eg public service increments) and&quot;merit increases&quot; on a predetermined incremental range of scale.    the distinction is a real but fine one and very difficult for the public tounderstand.    We must be careful to avoid the charge that we are giving an unfair advantage to anyone, particularly to Crown servants.    If mycolleagues decide that implementation of any prior agreements is to becaught by the standstill, Clause 4 would ensure that an employer who was prepared to observe the standstill voluntarily was not legally prevented from doing so.    Without such a provision, orders or notices would haveto be issued in every case.    That is said by the Treasury and theDepartment of Employment to be administratively impracticable.I am concerned, however, about the effect of such a provision onour industrial relations policy, the cornerstone of which has beenthat agreements once made should be honoured.    Many of our supporters would strongly oppose a Clause encouraging employers to breakagreements.    I am not sure how many employers would take advantageof it, in view of the risks of doing so to their industrial relations.    despite the administrative difficulties, I therefore consider on balance that theGovernment should take responsibility for any necessary breaking of agreements by making orders or notices.    I therefore conclude thatthe balance of advantage lies in deleting Clause 4.    While I recognisethat trade union opposition would be aroused if we did not permit publicservice or other increments in the standstill period, I believe we would find it very difficult to permit them if we retained this Clause.PENALTIES8,        In an earlier draft of the Bill provision was made that a warrantshould not be issued for imprisonment unless the court was satisfied thatno other means of enforcing a fine was available.   I am advised, however,that under the existing laws (as amended in the Criminal Justice Act 1967)there are substantial restrictions on the powers of a court to commit anoffender to prison for non-payment of a fine imposed for an offence notpunishable with imprisonment; and none of the Bill offences is punishablewith imprisonment.    The court can order imprisonment for non-paymentonly if they have considered or tried all other methods of enforcing payment and it appears to the court that they are inappropriate or unsuccessful.The provision in the earlier draft has therefore now been deleted.THE SCHEDULE TO THE bill.        This contains a number of provisions which are summarised inthe Annex to this paper.    Some of them will involve the need for ordersimmediately after the passage of this Bill.    Some of the powers aresweeping and we may be criticised for providing for them by order and notin the Bill itself.    But I believe the objective of keeping the Bill as short and simple as possible is right.R CPrivy Council Office3 November 1972
TOP SECRETANNEXNOTES ON THE SCHEDULEParagraph1.     This paragraph provides very wide powers concerning theprevisions which may be contained in orders or notices.     Thepurpose of the paragraph is to ensure that all necessaryprovisions can be made in orders.     It avoids setting them out at length in the Bill itself.     Without this paragraph the provisions could not be included in the orders.2.     This paragraph provides power to prescribe what the legalconsequences for contracts, leases and other transactionsare where they are affected by the restrictions imposed byClauses 1 and 2.     For example, to enable a person over-charged to recover an excess;    or to prevent a revival of aright to the excess payment after the end of the standstill.The paragraph would also enable an order to include provisions to ensure that pay increases prohibited duringthe standstill should not be paid afterwards or be unlawfullyexacted, e.(r. by strike action.     Without this paragraphthere would be considerable uncertainty as to the effect ofthe standstill in matters of this kind.3c     This paragraph ensures that the standstill overrides other legislation which regulates wages, prices, charges, etc.In particular, it would enable the recent award of theAgricultural Wages Board to be overridden.     It is a very far-reaching provision.4.     This paragraph contains necessary powers to amend or revokeorders already made.5.     This paragraph provides for orders to be subject to the negative resolution procedure.6.     This enables regulations to be made about the giving of notices.7.     This would enable an order to be made with the effect ofprohibiting increases of pay for Crown servants and wouldmake them liable to penalties in the event of industrial action and deprive them of any right to sue for withheldincreases.
