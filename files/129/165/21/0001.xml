PUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1976-77Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. At the Cabinet meeting on 13 July (CM(72) 36th Conclusions,Minute 5) the Cabinet agreed that the growth of public expenditure between 1971-72 and 1976-77 should not exceed an average annual rate of3.8 per cent in terms of use of resources,,    This was the rate consistent with the existing programmes set out in the 1972 Report of the public expenditure Survey Committee (PESC).    The Chief Secretary and I were invited to discuss with the Ministers concerned the problems of prioritiesentailed in the proposals for additional expenditure noted in the PESCReport, and I was asked to report the outcome.    This I now do.2. The Prime Minister circulated a minute to the Cabinet on15 September stressing the importance of keeping within the 3.8 per centlimit.    I set out in the Annex to this paper a table summarising theoriginal bids for additional expenditure (expressed in terms of the costin 1976-77) and the present state of play.    From this it will be seen thatnet bids of some  200 million are still outstanding (which would put the3.8 per cent up to 4 per cent).3. If these bids are accepted without being offset by savingselsewhere, they will automatically pre-empt part of the contingency reserve which stands at  750 million in 1976-77.    But there are alreadyother claims on that Reserve viz:  million. The development of existing poHcies in supportof industry in the fields of the Departments of Trade andIndustry and of Employment, which could cost about - 125(The Department of Employment element is ripe for transfer to the programmes themselves fromthe Contingency Reserve.)ii. The deficit finance (not to be confused with thecompensation for price restraint, which I assume to be phased out by 1976-77) which might be needed by somenationalised industries, particularly the railways and coal, unless they can be made structurally viable by1976-77.    This would cost a further - 125COPY NOfinU 0CP(72) 12113 November 1972CABINET
iii. Social security:  the 1972 PESC Report allowed for the hypothecation of a sum to cover one earningsuprating within existing Cabinet rulings.    This would cost - 300iv. The pressure on the Defence Budget at the agreedprovisional figure is so great that we might have to face a further call, say - 1006504. If in addition the outstanding bids in the Annex (which would vary from  130 million to  300 million) were added, it is clear that, on almostany reckoning, the whole of the Contingency Reserve would already represent-empted, leaving us do room for manoeuvre at all in the way of new policy developments.    Yet in ordinary circumstances I would reckon that 200 million should be left uncommitted as a matter of common prudence.5. There is one further and most important development.    Inaddition to the matters I have already referred to, we must recognisethat, following the tripartite talks and the counter-inflationary action weare now taking, we may well find ourselves faced with additional commitments, the duration of which we cannot at present foresee,6. There would be no more certain way of sapping confidence in thegeneral management of our affairs than - in the latter part of this parliament - to have to cut back on specific items of expenditure already announced or, alternatively, to have to reverse our taxation policies.Although we aim to maintain a higher growth rate in the economy, itwould be both economically and politically naive to fall into the old trapof making firm commitments on public expenditure without allowing foreven the possibility that we may be faced with problems when the existingslack in the economy has been taken up.7. I am grateful for the efforts which my colleagues have made toreduce expenditure or rephase it, or to offset extra spending.    But I havehad to consider very seriously asking for a further general examination oftheir programmes to provide sufficient further savings to give us thenecessary uncommitted margin while maintaining the 3.8 per cent limit.But this would take still more time, and I am sure that we ought now toproceed to publish the White Paper as near as possible to the normaltimetable.    Delay would be the subject of comment, and would threaten the confidence which is now being re-established as a result of our latestaction on pay and prices.8. In the White Paper we shall present the programmes on the usualfive-year base, starting with 1972-73;  and over this period the average rate of increase should come down towards 3. 5 per cent.    But it will beat once apparent to commentators and our supporters in Parliament that expenditure for 1972-73 is at an exceptionally high level (6, 5 per cent upon last year), and that the average rate of increase over the periodtherefore provides a superficially rosy picture of the real situation,
Treasury Chambers13 November 19729. I am therefore prepared to recommend the Cabinet to accept theposition now reached, as summarised in the Annex, as a basis for drafting the &quot;White Paper, subject to three conditions:a0 Favourable answers on the outstanding points in notes (2),(3), (4), (5) and (6(i)) in the Annex, because of the extremepressure (paragraph 4 above) cn the Contingency Reserve,b. We must ensure that our continuing examination of the programmes and projects within the PESC period, and reassess-ment of policies is necessary, is fully effective in keeping the totalsunder control and the balance of priorities right.c. We must have a clear understanding now that as plans forthe programmes are rolled forward this winter for 1977-78 weshall not run again any such risks as we shall be taking this year with 1976-77;  this means that the rate of increase of eachprogramme will be submitted to critical scrutiny with nopresumption that the rates in this year&apos;3 White Paper can becontinued.10.       Finally, given agreement on these points I shall do my best toensure that the presentation of our plans on the White Paper will not leave us vulnerable to criticism.    But presentational devices will certainlyfail us if we have not got adequate substantive control.A B

Note(1)    The Defence Budget is *under great pressure and may needadditionally to claim on the Contingency Reserve.(2)    The figure for 3(b) is not yet firm;      both items are subject to confirmation.(3)    These proposals await discussion in ES Committee.    I hopethey will not be pressed.(4)   Virtually the whole of the * 4 9 under item 11 ( at xssue mthe current Rate Support Grant negotiations) is attributable to Education.      Against this excess the Secretary of state has offered reductions of 181 under item 7-    Possible further reductions totalling 22 are still unresolved, of which 1\ hasbeen asked from Scotland.(5)    Subject to the Secretary of State&apos;s agreement to absorb thecost  ( 4 million for Great Britain) of the family planningproposal.(6)    This figure assumes:(i) that proposals for specific improvements of benefits(except for  6 million for increments for deferredretirement) are withdrawn.      This has yet to be confirmed.(ii) that as regards upratings - on which no immediate decision can be taken - there will be adopted the principleof differential  (lower) upratings for supplementary and short term benefits.      This is not yet agreed.    If allbenefits were uprated annually in line with earnings, itwould cost  100 million more.(8)    If the expenditure is held as in Notes  (2),  (3),  (5) and (6)(i)and the further reductions referred to in Note (4) above are achieved, the total would fall to  130 million;    if the possibleadditional  100 million in Note (6)(ii) materialises, the totalcould rise to  300 million.(7)For separate consideration.
