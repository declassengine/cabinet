Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1964Copy No. 6 5CABINETDECIMALISATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will wish to know the results of the intensive study of theHalsbury Report on Decimalisation which has taken place in the Treasury, and ofthe main issues for consideration and decision which seem to me to arise.2. The first, and crucial, point concerns the merits of decimalisation.Halsbury was not asked to enquire into this, but to confine himself to theadvantages and disadvantages of alternative systems and the practical problemsof transition. The Committee indeed considered that benefits, though likely to be substantial, were not measurable. Since, however, the main benefits arise from a saving of time in handling money and doing calculations in it, the Treasury hasattempted to estimate what this saving might be worth in the main fields where these activities are prominent banks, offices, and shops. On deliberately modestassumptions, the &quot; return &quot; comes out as large possibly a minimum rate of15 per cent on capital cost of the change-over; with a range up to 30 per cent ormore. From the point of view of the national economy, this is a large prospectivereturn, with benefits widely spread.3. But this is only the direct return. There is little doubt that a change in the currency as basic as this would cause a big shake-up in industry and commerce and result in much re-thinking of accounting and other methods. The indirectbenefits to efficiency could be large.4. Against all this has to be set the cost of a change-over. This was estimated by Halsbury to amount to  109 million, divided as to:  millionRe-equipment by firms    ......      .........      11\Coinage and requipment by Government Departments ...      22^Nationalised bodies and G.P.0.............       9109Of this, about  60 million would probably ultimately fall on the Exchequer, either as direct public expenditure, or additional investment by nationalised industries,or by virtue of tax relief.5. The great bulk of the expenditure would arise from conversion and purchase of office machinery which might be felt significantly in increased imports and reduced exports of office machines and in striking coinage.CP.

The present plans for expansion of the public sector already pre-emptresources during the next few years to the point at which there is doubt whetherenough room has been left for the necessary growth of exports, private investment,or the increase in private consumption that income-earners will expect. to accommodate the extra load on resources in the peak year ( 55 million), it mightbe necessary to moderate consumption by additional taxation equivalent to, say,3d. or 4d. on the standard rate of income tax. In other words, though the direct and indirect benefits of decimalisation may be large, the cost is heavy and meetingit as well as our other commitments will be difficult.8. This is the main problem. The next most important question is the choice of system. The Halsbury Committee recommended retention of the  ; a basic unit(which they called, for convenience, the cent) worth 2-4 present pence; and a half-cent worth 1-2 present pence. Ultimately the choice is between this system and one based on 10s. Most commentators have tended to favour a 10s. systemlargely because of the easier &quot; associability &quot; of new coins in it with existing coinsthan under the   system. There has also been a disposition to decry the argument -based on the international position of the   which played a big part in theHalsbury Committee&apos;s choice and is very strongly supported by the City, led bythe Bank of England.9. In my view, that choice is the correct one. Indeed, it is possible that theHalsbury Committee itself under-estimated the internal (as distinct frominternational) advantages of retaining the   as the familiar key standard of value.I believe we shall be on strong ground in arguing in favour of the Halsburyrecommendation based on the  ; but this is a matter to which my colleagues will wish to give careful consideration.10. Another major problem is compensation. There will be pressure for cashcompensation from the Exchequer for the costs incurred on conversion orreplacement by owners of business machines, who will point to the fact that SouthAfrica paid generous compensation and Australia is, apparently, preparing to dothe same. On the other hand, there are strong arguments against compensating thosewho stand to benefit considerably from decimalisation, and who, in the absence ofit, will have a strong incentive to reduce the costs of going over to the new system to a minimum. A possible exception is the small retailer, owning a single cash-register,whose costs might greatly outweigh any benefits he receives. The possibility of devising a scheme of compensation confined to this single class is now being urgentlyinvestigated by the Treasury and Board of Trade.11. The effect of decimalisation on the cost of living was fully examined bythe Halsbury Committee. Their view was that a rise of the order of f of a pointin the all-items index was likely, but that this might to some extent draw offsubsequent price rises. There would be little to choose so far as price increases were concerned between the   and 10s. systems.12. For the most part, the Halsbury recommendations on coinage seemacceptable. Among the most important is the proposal to abolish the half-pennybefore D-day (a change which is not very popular with the cigarette manufacturers6. The expenditure on resources would be expected to fall in the followingpattern:
HiPtid other producers of small-value goods). A new name will have to be found forthe minor unit (assuming the   system is adopted) the choice probably lies between&quot; cent &quot;, &quot; decimal penny &quot;, and &quot; new penny &quot;. New coins, worth \ and 1 &quot; newpenny &quot; (to use what may be the most acceptable name) smaller than the existinghalf-penny and penny-would be issued on D-day. The present Is. and 2s. would remain in circulation as the equivalent of 5 and 10 new pennies, and be replacedprogressively by new 5 and 10 new penny coins of the same size. There is some doubt whether a 2 new penny coin is needed from the outset, and furtherconsideration will have to be given to this. The present sixpence and half-crownwould be abolished some time after D-day. There is doubt about the acceptabilityof the Halsbury Committee&apos;s proposed 20 new penny coin, which would be as bigas the crown, and this may have to be dropped. All these are questions which willhave to be settled in due course.13. Administration. This will also need careful examination. The provisionalview reached by the Treasury study is that Ministers will be expected to answer in Parliament for the action of the body set up to carry decimalisation into effect,and that it should be a temporary Government department. This points to a subordinate department of the. Treasury, supported probably by an AdvisoryCouncil representative of a wide range of interests.14. Possible courses of action. In my view, there are four courses which theGovernment could take:(a) To decide to decimalise at the earliest practicable date. On the time-tablelaid down by Halsbury this would be February 1967. To meet it, anannouncement would have to be made almost immediately, and legislation passed (preferably) in the current Session;(b) To decide to decimalise in February 1968. Legislation could be left to thenext Session;(c) To defer a decision and announce that the issue was too fundamental tobe decided before the Election;(d) To decide not to decimalise.15. Course (a) will commend itself to those of my colleagues who are convinced that a decimal currency ought to be adopted. It would put an end touncertainty. Business machines companies are restive and fear that their sales of  s. d. machines will suffer if uncertainty continues. This course would also enablethe Government to meet its critics in the House and outside who complain abouttue long delay since the subject first came to life again four years ago. On theother hand, the time-table is tight, and legislation in this Session does not seemvery practicable. As a variant of Course (a), a firm decision could be announced,but legislation postponed to next Session, the risk of D-day slipping to 1968being accepted. Uncertainty, however, would remain.16. Course (b) is more realistic on the time-table. It admits from the outset that legislation this Session is impracticable. There is the same element of uncertainty as in the variant of (a).17. Course (c) would remove some uncertainty, in the sense that every one would know that there could be no decision to decimalise for some time, and mightnever be. My colleagues will be more concerned with the wider implications. Somecommentators have looked on decimalisation as an item in the programme forModernising Britain. Against this, it is not entirely clear that decimalisation hasmuch of an appeal to the public generally. Course (c) will also probably lead todecimalisation becoming a political issue. The Opposition may exploit any hesitationon our part, and even take over decimalisation as part of their own programme.18. Course (d), like Course (a), would have the merit of being a definite decision. Decimalisation has often been rejected by previous Governments. the choice between the   and the .10s. might be said to be an impossible one so long as acoin more or less equivalent to the present penny is needed. If that is so, then itmight be better to wait a generation or so until the value of money has declinedenough to make the \ cent (or \ new penny) in the   system unnecessary. It wouldnot necessarily, however, end uncertainty altogether; because the Opposition might say that they, if returned, would decimalise.
Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,21st January, 1964.19. My colleagues will want to consider which course they wish to adopTAny decision in favour of decimalisation would have to be accompanied by a firmstatement of our intentions on:(1) The choice of system.-Do we support the Halsbury recommendation infavour of a system based on the  , or prefer a 10s. system?(2) Compensation. Are we against it in principle, subect to a possible exception for the small shop-keeper with a single machine?It would probably be desirable at the same time to promise a White Paper sometime in the future setting out the Government^ intentions on these and the lesscrucial, though still very important, questions referred to above.R.
