M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,21st January, 1964.THE CHANNEL CROSSINGMemorandum by officials the Economic Policy Committee, at their meeting on 16th January (E.P. (64)2nd Meeting, Item 1) took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrangefor the submission to the Cabinet of a memorandum setting out the arguments forand against a decision in principle in favour of British participation in a ChannelTunnel; and an analysis of the prospects of obtaining external private finance andthe terms likely to be relevant. This paper deals with these two matters; it must beconsidered in conjunction with the paper on Government Expenditure after 1968(CP. (64) 19) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Chief Secretary to theTreasury and in particular public investment, and the competing claims uponresources.The Tunnel Project2. Since the cost and navigation hazards rule out the bridge and its variants,the choice lies between a tunnel and the development of the existing sea and airlinks in order to meet the prospective expansion of cross-Channel traffic. The choiceis between two quite different ways of meeting the same need: the tunnel is alarge capital-investment project, most of the expenditure falling in the two years1968-69 and 1969-70, but with low operating costs. The total initial capital costof the tunnel would be about  143 million (United Kingdom share about half) andthe costs in the subsequent 50 years, discounted to the year in which the tunnelstarted operation, would be nearly  70 million. Continued reliance on sea and airlinks (including possibly such developments as Hovercraft) would involve much higher operating costs and higher total capital costs, but these would be spreadover a long period. The sum of these capital replacements and operating costsover 50 years would (also discounted to the year of opening the tunnel) be nearly 310 million (United Kingdom share rather more than half). The choice, therefore,is between a large bunch of capital expenditure between 1968-70 with lower coststhereafter, and considerably higher costs spread over a much longer period.3. It has been estimated that the economic benefit (i.e., to users as well as tooperators) of the tunnel compared with the continued reliance on establishedmeans as they expand, would be 13-3 per cent on the &quot;upper&quot; level of traffic3805
The Case for the Tunnel4.   The arguments in favour of a tunnel are as follows:(a) It would be likely to benefit our policy, following the breakdown of theCommon Market negotiations, to foster and maintain the European-mindedness of the United Kingdom; to develop practical links with european countries in the interests of United Kingdom trade and western solidarity; and in relation to France specifically, to pursueco-operative enterprises which are of positive advantage to the UnitedKingdom. The Channel Tunnel could be regarded as a striking anddramatic gesture in this field.(b) As indicated in paragraph 2, on the basis of the return to the economy generally over a long period, the tunnel can be regarded as having afavourable advantage over continued reliance on existing means. If,for the reasons explained below, the project were a public one and were then so judged, the prospective financial return on the investment would-be adequate.(c) This country would stand to benefit economically from a new facility whichwould both reduce the costs and improve the quality of the links with europe and would benefit from the increases in goods and passenger traffic. The tunnel would certainly benefit the movement of goods wherethere was a high cost in relation to transport charges, though this would only help, of course, as long as United Kingdom export prices werecompetitive. The United Kingdom would stand to gain more overall.  from the tunnel than France and other European countries.(d) The load imposed -by the tunnel on the building industry would be fairly small since the main part of the work would fall uponspecialised firms and the civil engineering firms which were used to bringing labour and equipment from afar.Arguments against the Tunnel5.   The arguments against the tunnel are as follows:. (a) If the project were divided fifty-fifty with France, the United kingdom share of the capital costs at current prices would be about  80 million,including small amounts of complementary road and rail works on theUnited Kingdom side. Three-quarters of this expenditure would fall inthe two years 1968-69 and 1969-70 if work began in 1964. The tunnel would be competing with other items in the rapidly rising public. investment programme, the major elements of which are all of high priority. Yet, unlike some other items in the public investment programme, the Channel Tunnel is clearly optional from the economicpoint of view. The Economic Policy Committee felt that the tunnel wasa sound proposition economically and one which it would be difficultto reject because of the political consequences of doing so. nevertheless the harsh fact remains that the accommodation of the tunnel withinthe investment resources available gives rise to great difficulty. This isexamined in the Chancellors paper CP. (64) 19.(b) Much of the economic benefit of the tunnel would go to users rather than to the operator; this is the reason why the economic benefit referredto in paragraph 2 is noticeably higher than the financial return which an operator may expect. It is significant that the private promotershave all along said that they would expect a guarantee for the bondswhich in effect is a form of subsidy. Apart from this the return expected,while adequate in the context of other nationalised industries&apos;investment, is not so high as to indicate any significant advantage.ragwhich is now thought to be realistic. The financial return is rather lower becaus?some of the economic benefit would accrue to the users, and it is estimated that itwould be between 9 per cent and 11 per cent. A comparison of yearly expenditure by the United Kingdom on the tunnel (assuming fifty-fifty sharing with the French)and on existing means made by the Anglo-French Official Side Group, shows thatthe existing means have an advantage up to about 1977, but that thereafter thetunnel has an increasing advantage.
Organisation and Finance6. The tunnel would constitute a man-made link between the UnitedKingdom and France; the railway undertakings on both sides of the Channel arenationalised and will, of course, be closely concerned in the operation of the tunnel.Moreover, once the project had started the Governments would be morallycommitted to seeing it through whatever the formal arrangements between themand the private promoters. For all these reasons, therefore, a project of this nature would have to be subject to a high degree of control over its construction and financing; and also, once completed, over the charges to be levied, the type of services offered and the prevention of discrimination between different types ofusers. Following long-standing United Kingdom policy towards public utilities itwould probably also be necessary to prevent the interests of shareholders frompredominating over those of users of a monopoly or quasi-monopoly; this couldinvolve a degree of limitation of distribution of profits but would probably besatisfied by control of charges levied. The United Kingdom and french governments would inevitably insist that they and they alone (and on a fifty-fiftybasis) should exercise these controls. Against this background the success of anysizeable equity issue must be seriously in doubt. These requirements would haveto be embodied in a concession if the enterprise were private and would themselves affect the attitude of private investors.7. The Channel Tunnel Study Group&apos;s original proposals for a privateventure tunnel include requests for tax concessions and Government guarantees of the bond capital (which would form much the greater part of the finance).Following the publication of Cmnd. 2137, the request for tax concessions, though not formally withdrawn, has not been pressed but the request for guaranteesremains. The fact is however that a private venture of this kind is not reallyprivate at all. Government guaranteed bonds would in practice form part ofthe gilt-edged market. With the guarantee, fixed interest capital could be raised at a lower rate than would otherwise be possible: this would in effect be a subsidy from the Governments to the equity investors, and by involving themselvesin this way with such a large proportion of the finance the Governments wouldin effect be sharing the risks proper to the equity investors.8. For both reasons therefore the requests by the private promoters forGovernment assistance and the public policy aspects discussed in paragraph 6 the Economic Policy Committee concluded that, so far as the United kingdom is concerned, it would be best for the project to be undertaken as a publicenterprise. The French are understood to be anxious to take up what private capital there is that is available and interested in the project, but this attitudedoes not necessarily imply a difference of view over the public nature of the project (the indications from, for example, the arrangements for the MontBlanc Tunnel suggest an approach not far removed from the views in paragraph above); and there are no reasons why the French contribution to the financing of the project should not be arranged in their own way. What is clear is that private equity in any sense normally understood in this country is not appropriate,and as far as fixed interest finance is concerned, it is our practice to make issuesfrom the Exchequer (e.g., to the nationalised industries) rather than to guaranteebond issues.9. Given the insistence on governmental control, finance can to some extent be treated separately. It would not be necessary for the two countries each to find50 per cent of the total finance the capital markets of other countries mightcontribute. On the other hand, it would probably not be desirable for the amountto be raised by the London Market to fall below (say) 25-30 per cent of the totalfinance required, and it would be acceptable for a higher amount to be raised by thiscountry if this seemed desirable in the event.10. Raising finance in foreign markets would depend partly on the positionof London vis-a-vis other centres, and partly on the terms offered. As regards theterms, if a higher rate of interest were attached to the securities, this extra cost tothe project would have to be balanced against the advantage of securing these foreignfunds. Furthermore, due advantage of an inflow would turn on the extent to whichit was additional to the normal inflow of foreign funds to the London Market.11. If a Government guarantee were attached, the rate of interest could beheld but this would inevitably mean that the money was being raised on the credit
Her Majesty&apos;s Treasury, S.W. 1,21st January, 1964.of the Government and not that of the project; and the question would arise agai^Pwhether the funds would be a true addition to the normal inflow to the london market. Hitherto, moreover, it has not been considered acceptable for bonds to befloated in foreign markets with a United Kingdom Government guarantee but thepossibility of &quot; Channel Tunnel Company Bonds &quot;, as they might be called, beingfloated on some foreign markets, either with a United Kingdom guarantee or jointlyguaranteed by the United Kingdom and French Governments is not to be ruled out as impracticable. (The Bonds might be assisted by being made bearer securities andif issued in the United Kingdom freed from United Kingdom tax at source forforeign holders.) And these might well form part of the total contribution to bearranged by the London Market, and thus reduce the extent of a direct exchequer contribution. The benefit to be obtained by such arrangements requires carefulanalysis, however, in the light of the terms and market conditions at the time; forthe present it seems sufficient to conclude that the possibility of raising extra financein foreign markets by some such methods should be kept in mind.Conclusion12. The way in which the detailed financing, construction, management and operation of a tunnel would be carried out will depend on the outcome of further negotiations with the French. As regard financing, although the French approach is somewhat different from the United Kingdom&apos;s, the difference does not seem to beso large as to preclude eventual agreement-given a decision to go ahead inprinciple. If the tunnel is accepted into the Governments forward plans, these further discussions should take place as socm as possible and, subject to the viewsof the Cabinet, the United Kingdom representatives should be guided by the views*:expressed above on the public nature of the project. If the decision on financingand organisation are not announced at the same time as a decision in principle,there would be undesirable speculation in the shares of the existing Channel TunnelCompany. These discussions should therefore precede any announcement by either government that it favours the tunnel in principle.
