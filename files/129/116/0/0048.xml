IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC M A JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1964     . ..  -CP. (64) 48 Copy No.   6218th February, 1964 &apos;CABINETPENSION RIGHTS OF DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC - PROSECUTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and theChief Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster general we much regret that although the matter has twice come before the HomeAffairs Committee (FLA. (63) 12th Meeting, Conclusion 3 and H.P. (63) 4thMeeting, Conclusion 1) and discussions among the Ministers concerned havebeen going on for the best part of two years, it has not been possible to reach agreement about the pension rights of the Director of Public Prosecutions.2. The Director is a civil servant who has hitherto been pensionable underthe Civil Service Superannuation Acts. No use has up to now been made of thepower to grant &quot; added years&quot; in calculating the Director^ pension. If, therefore,a new Director were appointed on the same terms as the present one and hispredecessors, his salary would be  6,750; his pension after 15 years&apos; service wouldbe  1,266; and his lump sum (after deduction of up to one-third in respect ofwidow&apos;s pension) would be not less than  2,531.3. Recognising, as we do, the need to secure the appointment of a newDirector of suitable calibre, we are agreed that if the appointment is made from outside the Civil Service the maximum number of added years should be given.This would mean, with a salary of  6,750, a pension after 15 years of  2,025 and,on the same basis as above, a lump sum of not less than  4,050. As an alternative,the Treasury are prepared to maintain a private insurance contract within anannual limit of 10 per cent of salary. We understand that if an insurance contracthad been entered into in the late 1950s to provide for an annuity of  2,500 perannum, beginning at age 65, in the late 1970s the amount of premium for aperson of normal health would probably just fall within this limit.4. The Attorney-General has in the course of our discussions made a numberof proposals for higher benefits, which we have been unable to accept. In bis present paper he proposes that the Director should have the same pension benefits as a judge, namely, after fifteen years, half salary, i.e.,  3,375. But, if the proposal is tooffer the full superannuation terms of a judge, the Director would get in additiona lump sum of  3,375 and a one-third pension for his widow.5. This proposal would involve specific legislation directed to the improvementof the superannuation terms of this office alone.6. The proposal, then, would give the Director a right to a judge&apos;s pension.Judicial pensions are more generous than those for any other form of public service.The Director is not a judge, nor are his functions of a judicial character. To attachjudicial terms to the post of D.P.P. would blur the present dividing line betweenjudicial officers, on the one hand, and legal appointments in the Civil Service on theother; and it is much to be feared that there would soon be pressure to extend these terms to other legal appointments and to other Civil Service posts, particularlyprofessional posts to which people can be recruited late in life from outside.Moreover, the terms are more generous than those which the Inland Revenue isprepared to accept in relation to private industry.3954
7. Special legislation to provide extremely generous pension terms for a paalready attracting a large salary and a pension of the order of  2,000 a year (whtiother benefits) might well attract public criticism. There is a good deal of currentfeeling about alleged &quot; anomalies &quot; in public service pension and superannuationarrangements, and there are unsatisfied claims commanding a considerable measureof Parliamentary support, e.g., for &quot; full reckoning &quot; of unestablished civil serviceand for improvements in the arrangements for pensions increase. It may well be suggested at least that Parliamentary time should be found for these problems inpriority to the creation of new benefits for one highly-paid post.8. We remain, therefore, opposed to the Attorney-GeneraFs proposal, andwe suggest that every effort should be made to fill the post on the basis of one orother of the arrangements described in paragraph 3 above.H.
