Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 13 Copy No.   6 29th January, 1964CABINETRESALE PRICE maintenance memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate this memorandum as Chairman of the Economic Policy Committee.2. The Committee has discussed a proposal by the Secretary of State for industry that he should announce before 17th January that the Government will introduce legislation this Session to make the practice of resale price maintenanceillegal this as one of a package of measures covering also monopolies, mergersand restrictive practices in the fields of goods and services on which he is circulating a separate memorandum.3. The Secretary of State drew attention to a number of developments sincethe last of several inconclusive discussions which Ministers have had in recent years on this subject.(a) Following investigations over several years, the Monopolies commission have recently issued a report on the industry making electricalcomponents for cars, which, among other things, declares the practiceof resale price maintenance by that industry to be against the publicinterest and recommends that it be abolished. The Opposition are seekingan early debate on this report.(b) The Commission is on the point of issuing a similar report, following two years of study of the wallpaper industry, making the samerecommendation.The Secretary of State cannot act on the recommendation in either case, as hehas no power to do so at present.(c) The Consumer Council has come out strongly in opposition to retention ofresale price maintenance.(d) Impatience with present conditions under resale price maintenanceexpressed itself recently in the popularity of trading stamps.(e) The Secretary of State has repeated his predecessor^ promise of an early statement of Government policy.(/) Mr. Stonehouse has introduced under the ballot a Bill to abolish resale price maintenance. This is due for second reading on 17th January.(g) The modernisation of Britain has become our dominant theme in economic policy.4. Against this background, previously divided opinion in the Committeeon the wisdom of challenging resale price maintenance has given place to a unanimous view that some Government action against the practice should be announced before the debate on Mr. Stonehouse&apos;s Bill.5. The Committee are not agreed on the nature of that action, and submittwo alternatives for consideration by the Cabinet.!S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT3746
6.   Some Ministers, including the Secretary of State for Industry himself,attracted by immediate legislation banning resale price maintenance outrightwithout exception. The main arguments in favour of this are:(i) We need the benefit of anti-inflationary measures now in 1964. resale price maintenance weakens incentives to find and apply more efficientmethods of distribution; and few disinterested authorities question that its abolition would bring down prices.(ii) Where it has been brought to an end, here (in the grocery trade) and overseas, fear that this would put many small retailers out of businesshave proved unfounded.(iii) If the choice is between abrupt action and gradual action, and theopposition is largely from small men for fear of the consequences, theremay be little to be gained by leaving them to worry instead ofconfronting them with those consequences. Their place in thecommunity rests not on the prices they command but on the specialkind of service they give.(iv) The Government^ performance on Mr. Stonehouse&apos;s Bill may be widelyawaited as the test of our sincerity over modernisation.(v) The boldest measures may secure the widest support, especially from our younger generation who ardently support rapid modernisation,less cossetting and more real opportunity.(vi) In the longer run, too, it is likely to be better to have killed the problem at a blow than to have to deal with it again and again in particular cases.7. Other Ministers, however, favour the proposal put forward by the ministerial Sub-Committee on Monopolies last summer, under the Secretary ofState&apos;s predecessor. They suggested that we should use the monopolies commission; we could take one by one the classes of goods in which resale price maintenance is at present operated and in each case ask the Commission to look into the practice and report on whether it was against the public interest; wherethe Commission condemned the practice, the Government would be ready (butnot obliged) to prohibit it for the goods concerned. This would involve taking thenecessary powers in an early Bill. The advantages seen in this course are :(vii) Resale price maintenance has been examined and exonerated in two cases tobacco and books. There should be provision for such exceptions. (It can be argued against this that the verdicts might wellbe different to-day with change of circumstances and amendedinformation.) We could take the line that we are opposed to the practicewhere it is against the public interest. People would have an opportunityto argue the case for it in the circumstances of their own particulartrade. There would be no presumption that the practice generally was against the public interest.(viii) We should avoid making the practice a statutory offence; where it was prohibited this would be by an Order, and procedure against anydisobedience of the Order would be by way of a court injunction (withan action for contempt in the last resort).(ix) The mere fact that the Government had provided for investigation wouldprobably bring about the collapse of the practice, piece by piece. Inany case we could start at once with some popular, proven cases,including wallpaper and electrical components for cars.(x) Such a gradual process might arouse less protest from small retailersthan a sudden end to the practice. It might be significant that the processhas been gradual in the grocery trade where it has aroused little protestdespite the numerous small shops.(xi) If the practice were ended suddenly in this Parliament, the consequences of its ending might remain uncertain until much later, and this couldbe a disturbing influence on opinion inside and outside Parliament.(xii) A gradual start would not rule out general legislation later if experience showed this to be justified.
P 8. The choice involves some general considerations. Approval among thegeneral public may not be matched by credit to us. Small retailers, who are well organised, number about 500,000 of our 580,000 retail establishments. The grocersare no longer in point; we are concerned now mainly with chemists, tobacconists,confectioners and retailers of electrical goods, who must number substantially less than half the 500,000. The chemists may be particularly difficult; they willclaim that if their profits on perfumery and photography are cut, their charges for dispensing must rise. Publishers, too, will be influential antagonists if our policy entails revising the verdict which is regarded as exonerating resale price maintenance for books.9. The Economic Policy Committee consider that the Secretary of State for industry should be authorised to announce the Cabinefs decision before thedate of the debate on Mr. Stonehouse&apos;s Bill (17th January), and invite the Cabinetto decide which of the two methods should be adopted.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,9th January, 1964.
