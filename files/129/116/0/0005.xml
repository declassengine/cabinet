It is issued for the personal use of............................................................;.Copy No.  7 4CP (64) 56th January, 1964CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS INDONESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at our meeting of 17th December, 1963 (CM. (63) 13th Conclusions, Item 4),my colleagues invited me to examine the political and military factors affectingthe United Kingdom&apos;s policy of support for Malaysia. It seemed to me that themost useful answer I could make would be to summarise the various policies opento us and to examine briefly the advantages and disadvantages of each. I now circulate to my colleagues the attached paper setting out the possible alternatives,under the following broad heads:(a) intensifying the struggle;(b) maintaining our present defensive posture;(c) reaching a settlement.2. I have covered the whole range of possible courses starting with offensivemilitary action (also considered in more detail in a separate paper for the defence and Oversea Policy Committee, which I am circulating) in order that my colleagues may consider what (if any) change in our policy over Malaysia is required or wouldbe desirable. We have incurred criticism in some quarters for not taking more vigorous action towards Indonesia and in others for not being more active in meetingIndonesian demands for a negotiated settlement. We have shown our determination to support Malaysia not only in the military field, but also by our public decisionto cut off arms supplies and to suspend, at some cost to ourselves, the Decca radarcontract. There are some signs that the Indonesian leaders are beginning to realise that their policy of aggressive confrontation towards their small neighbour ishurting themselves; but this is unlikely in itself to bring about any substantial change of policy on the part of President Sukarno unless he can be brought to feelthat the United States attitude is more wholeheartedly with us. Nor are other western Governments (notably Germany and Japan) likely to stop trying to conciliate Indonesia as long as the United States Government hesitate to commit themselves. Even Australia and New Zealand are influenced by the United states attitude.3. It is because of this ambivalent attitude of our major ally that I hesitate to recommend a departure from our present policy in favour of any of the moreforcible courses of action set out in this paper. Similarly it is because the UnitedStates Government would only be too glad to seize upon any opening for a negotiated settlement, in which a reluctant Tunku might be forced from concession to concession, that I hesitate to propose any initiatives intended to pave the way for negotiation at this stage. From my talk with Mr. Rusk on 19th December, I did not derive great hope of any drastic change in United States policy, although I think they may be more helpful in certain matters and the despatch of an aircraft carrier task force to the Indian Ocean has already agitated the Indonesians.TOP SECRET3727 aTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
4. In seeking the views of my colleagues on any possible change in our policy\towards Indonesia, my own inclination is that our present defensive policy is justabout right since it has the great advantage of keeping a number of options open,at least some of which could be exploited as opportunity offers. In short we shouldcontinue to maintain our military defensive posture, while increasing our capabilityby such accretions of Malaysian, Australian and New Zealand strength as we can;we should avoid as far as possible any extension of the conflict outside the island of Borneo. Reference to the United Nations is likely to do Malaysia and ourselvesmore harm than good and should be avoided as long as it is reasonable to do so.Even though a negotiated settlement may have to come in the long run, we should remain wary of well intentioned but misguided initiatives to this end. Lastly weshould continue to attempt to persuade our reluctant allies, the United States first and foremost, and the Germans, our other NATO allies and the Japanese, thatthe possibility of influencing Sukarno does not rest in pandering to his threat to turn Communist but rather that failure to stand up to him now will only increasethe risk of Indonesia becoming Communist later.5. The attached paper has been agreed with officials of the commonwealth relations Office and Ministry of Defence.R. A. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,6th January, 1964.annex .-INTRODUCTIONOur present essentially defensive policy is already encountering criticism andthis is likely to increase the longer Indonesian confrontation continues. It seemsworth taking a brief look at the alternative courses open to us on the assumptionthat the Indonesians persist in their present policy and refrain either from overtaggression or from initiating negotiations on an acceptable basis. The various possibilities examined below cover the whole range open to us from outright war to various forms of negotiation. They fall into three groups: policies for intensifyingthe struggle; defensive policies; and policies aiming at a settlement.II-POLICIES FOR INTENSIFYING THE STRUGGLEOffensive military action by regular forces. The Chiefs of Staff have examined various plans intended to causeIndonesia sufficient damage to induce her to call off confrontation against-Malaysia.During the Indonesian independence struggle, however, the Dutch twice inflicteda complete defeat on Indonesian military forces. On the second occasion theycaptured President Sukarno and most of his Ministers. Nevertheless the DutchCommander-in-Chief had to report that even this had effected little significant reduction in Indonesian guerilla activity. Admittedly the Indonesians were thenfighting for. their independence and on their own soil, but Indonesian national unity and the authority of the Indonesian Government have greatly increased since thatperiod. The importance of this is that no military action we contemplate could makeit militarily impossible for the Indonesians to continue and even intensify guerillaactivity. Our offensive could only put a stop to this if iV succeeded ;in breaking the determination of the Indonesian Government or their authority over their own people. In the light of past experience, it seems unlikely that offensive military actionon our part could achieve this, unless such action were of so drastic a character(i.e., nuclear bombing) that it would invite retaliation from, for instance the soviet union. We should in any case be exposed to international censure, which would
in turn fortify the morale of the Indonesian Government and people. We wouldliave to expect such censure, because international opinion generally does not regardfomenting a rebellion in someone else&apos;s country (which is all the Indonesians admitto doing) as justifying the victim in openly carrying the war into his tormentor&apos;scountry (cf. international, including United Kingdom reactions to the Frenchbombing of Tunisian territory during the Algerian war).Securing the support of our Allies3. Unless the Indonesians resort to overt aggression, when the United StatesGovernment have indicated that they would support us, there is little prospect of inducing any country except Australia and New Zealand to give us military assistance. Other forms of assistance are considered in Section III (paragraph 8)below.Securing United Nations support4. Malaysia probably commands more sympathy in the United Nations thanIndonesia (who nevertheless has her supporters there), but there is little support for the United Kingdom military presence in South-East Asia as such and a widespread disposition to think that there are faults on both sides. The probableresult of approaching the United Nations would be:(a) A vote of sympathy for Malaysia with no provision for sanctions againstIndonesia; or(b) A  recommendation  that  Malaysia   and  Indonesia   should  resume negotiations, perhaps under United Nations auspices, but almost certainly not on the conditions demanded by Malaysia.The second result would be particularly likely if there had at the time been noovert act of Indonesian aggression by regular forces. It is most unlikely that any sort of majority could be found for sanctions, for a United Nations peace-keepingforce or even for the despatch of observers, unless Indonesia meanwhile commitsovert aggression or negotiations have first been tried and failed. Moreover, evenif the United Nations could be persuaded to take such action, it would notnecessarily be to our advantage. United Nations observers, for instance, mighthamper the operations of our regular forces more than they would Indonesianinfiltration and subversion. Finally, the more the United Nations intervene, thegreater the voice they would demand in negotiating a settlement. And, oncenegotiations are internationalised, Malaysia will be subjected to pressure, as theprice of peace with Indonesia, to abandon her defence agreement with us and to deprive us of the Singapore base. Briefly, therefore, recourse to the United Nationscould help to mobilise sympathy for Malaysia or it could provide an excuse forescaping from our commitments to Malaysia; it would not, however, significantlyassist to end Indonesian confrontation on acceptable terms.Bringing the conflict into the open5. All the courses considered above would do this in varying degrees, as wouldan official propaganda campaign intended to expose the extent of Indonesian bad faith and aggressiveness. This would provide a satisfying outlet for much UnitedKingdom indignation, but it would also stimulate demands for stronger action.Abroad its benefits would probably be confined to the United States and commonwealth public opinion. Elsewhere it would be more likely to stimulatea demand for the resumption of negotiations than for effective assistance to malaysia and ourselves. Its greatest disadvantage, however, which it shares with all the othercourses so far considered, would be to reduce the range of options open to us.As long as our conflict with Indonesia remains unofficial and bilateral, we retain the initiative. We can choose either to intensify it or to seek a settlement. once we either internationalise it or turn it into war (declared or undeclared)1 against awicked aggressor, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be restricted in their freedomof action both by public opinion at home and by international pressure. So will the Indonesian Government, whose pretence that they are only giving limited help to an indigenous resistance movement, however irritating in its mendacity, doesat least leave them the possibility (which we should be careful not to destroy) of withdrawing from confrontation without intolerable loss of prestige. Once we turn3727
the present ambiguous struggle into an open Anglo-Indonesian conflict, neither ofns will be able to withdraw without admitting defeat. Moreover, it would be mos;cunWise to contemplate bringing the conflict into the open without the approvalof the United States, Australian and New Zealand Governments. This is most unlikely to be forthcoming in the present state of the Indonesian threat.III.-DEFENSIVE policies the strategy of attrition6. Our present policy is to remain on the defensive militarily; to minimise,in official statements and propaganda, the importance of Indonesian confrontation;and to maintain diplomatic and commercial relations with Indonesia to the extent that Indonesia will permit. This entails a prolonged but restricted struggle to defendMalaysia against Indonesian infiltration, subversion, intimidation and boycott. we hope that the Indonesian Government, realising that confrontation is not weakeningour resolution, will eventually weary of the struggle under the pressure of internal,particularly economic, stresses. The advantage of this policy is that it need not close the door to the possibility that the Indonesian Government may change their mindsand seek a negotiated solution. The danger is rather that United Kingdom publicopinion might lose patience first and insist on either escalation or negotiation.The impression that our soldiers have been condemned to fight an interminable warwith one hand tied behind their backs is, of course, precisely the reaction for whichthe Indonesians hope. Moreover, when our policy really begins to make itself felt in Indonesia, there will be some risk that the Indonesians might resort to furtherretaliation against United Kingdom interests in that country or even (though this seems unlikely) to overt aggression.Retaliatory components (diplomatic and economic) of the defensive policy7. Our present policy does not, of course,- exclude certain measures of retaliation against Indonesia intended to expedite Indonesian weariness withconfrontation. An important element, for instance, is persuading other countries,particularly our Western allies, to give Malaysia diplomatic support and to denyIndonesia arms and aid. The denial of economic aid is particularly important,because of the acute economic difficulties already being experienced by Indonesia,which her Government are beginning to realise may prove impossible to alleviatewhile confrontation continues. So far the response to such requests to our allieshas been half-hearted, since we have so far supported these requests only byreasoned argument. If we were to apply sufficient pressure, we might obtain greater co-operation. To take an extreme case, West Germany would probably comply if wethreatened to recognise East Germany. Even without going so far, we could securemuch additional co-operation by making Indonesia a kind of &quot; King Charles&apos; head &quot;in our diplomacy throughout the world and refusing our co-operation on issuesaffecting the interests of other countries, unless those countries adopted an acceptable attitude towards Indonesia. Such a policy would require great care inits application, if the benefits obtained were not to be outweighed by the resultingloss of goodwill among our friends and allies. The latter might also react by applyingconcerted pressure on Malaysia and ourselves to reach a negotiated settlement with Indonesia. Many of them have only been induced to suspend earlier movesof this kind by our assurances that we could cope with Indonesia unaided.IV.-POLICIES AIMING AT A SETTLEMENTPromoting negotiations between Malaysia and Indonesia8. There are many ways in which such negotiations could be promoted;through the United Nations (see paragraph 5); through the good offices of one ofthe countries that have previously shown themselves disposed to mediate (Germany,Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and the United States) or by a direct UnitedKingdom appeal to both sides. Similarly such negotiations could either be bilateralor have a neutral Chairman or even be expanded to the status of an international conference. However such negotiations are approached and whatever their formalcharacter, there must always be one major obstacle to be overcome. The
Indonesians have repeatedly declared their readiness to negotiate &quot; without priorconditions&quot; (i.e,, while continuing confrontation), whereas the Malaysiansunderstandably insist that Indonesia must call off confrontation and recogniseMalaysia before any negotiation is possible. Unless prolonged attrition or UnitedStates pressure on a scale not hitherto contemplated by the United StatesGovernment induce the Indonesians to modify their attitude, it would accordingly be necessary for the Malaysian Government to make considerable concessionsbefore negotiations could even begin. In present circumstances it is unlikely thatthe Malaysian Government could be brought to consider concessions without suchUnited Kingdom pressure as would destroy Malaysian confidence in their defencerelationship with the United Kingdom. From the Malaysian point&apos;of view thereis nothing to negotiate about. Indonesia arbitrarily started the quarrel&apos;and it is forher to stop her aggressive activities. It is for this- reason that we have not onlyourselves refrained from suggesting any Malaysian initiative to resume negotiations^but have also discouraged other countries from doing so. In the last resort,Malaysia can afford to ignore attempts at mediation by third parties as long as she is still confident of United Kingdom support and, whoever takes the initiative in trying to get negotiations started again, the success of their efforts will ultimatelydepend on the answer to two questions:(a) Will the United States put such extreme pressure on Indonesia that sheconcedes a basis for negotiation acceptable to Malaysia?(b) Will the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand put such extremepressure on Malaysia that she concedes a basis for negotiation acceptable to Indonesia?9. Getting negotiations started, however, would only be the first hurdle.Unless negotiations ended in something tantamount to unconditional surrender byIndonesia and it is hard to foresee this being possible for a long time to come-the result would have to be a compromise. Such a compromise would surely either be damaging to Malaysia (a plebiscite in the Borneo territories or concessions tothe Philippines over North Borneo) or to the United Kingdom defence positionin South-East Asia (restrictions on the use of the Singapore base and possiblyprovisions for its gradual liquidation). It would be useless, therefore, for us to contemplate a negotiated solution unless Indonesia had first been brought to herknees by a prolonged process of attrition or unless Malaysia and we were ready tomake concessions as well as to receive them;A temporary modus vivendi10. What might be more possible is some form of agreement intended notto provide a complete and lasting solution, but only to give the Indonesians an excuse for suspending confrontation. It has often been argued by the United StatesGovernment and others that another &quot; Manila type&quot; meeting between representatives of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines would be able to produce a formula to save the Indonesian face and enable them to suspend confrontation.At the prompting of the Philippine Government, the Thai Government, for instance,suggested on 16th December a month&apos;s truce, to be followed by a meeting in Bangkokof the Tunku and the Presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines. The MalaysianGovernment are seeking clarification of this proposal, which has certain snags. the indonesian attitude is not yet known. Even if the Indonesians could be persuaded to accept this proposal on a basis satisfactory to the Malaysian Government, which seems doubtful in present circumstances, the difficulty of finding an acceptable basis on which definitive negotiations could start would still have to be overcome. Anotheralternative would be to enlist the good offices of, say, the Government of Pakistan.Anglo-Indonesian negotiations11. The position of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is somewhat ambiguous. Onthe one hand we are merely supporting Malaysia, herself the principal victim ofIndonesian confrontation. On the other hand, the Indonesians have often declaredthat the United Kingdom is the true object of their hostility and that they wouldhave no quarrel with Malaysia but for Malaysia&apos;s connection with us. Moreover, asthe consequences of Indonesian hostility bear at least as heavily on us as onMalaysia, we have as much right (and duty) as Malaysia to try to settle ourdifferences by negotiation. Unfortunately normal diplomatic contacts between the
United Kingdom and Indonesia have almost ceased. The Indonesian Ambassado^fein London carries no weight with his Government and Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador^in Djakarta is seldom permitted access to Indonesian Ministers or even senior officials. In these circumstances if it were thought desirable to make one lastUnited Kingdom effort to talk to Indonesia before the danger of having to fighther comes any nearer, it would be necessary to take some special initiative. Insome ways this would be an advantage. Asian love of dramatic gesture would givea special United Kingdom initiative more chance of success than if normaldiplomatic channels were employed. It would also appeal to our allies and otherfriends abroad and might finally persuade them, whatever the outcome, that wewere less stubborn and intransigent than they had supposed. The danger, however,would be that public opinion in the United Kingdom or Malaysia (to say nothing ofthe Indonesians) might misinterpret such a move, not as a last chance for the indonesians, but as a sign of weakness or appeasement on our part.An invitation to President Sukarno12. If we wished to consider a United Kingdom peace initiative, by far themost dramatic and effective gesture we could make would be for the Prime Ministerto invite President Sukarno to come to London for a personal discussion of anglo-Indonesian relations. The President is known to be frustrated at the failureof confrontation to make any impact and anxious at Indonesian popular discontentwith increasing economic privations. His concern for his own personal prestige isone of the main factors deterring him from modifying his policy. If this prestige,together with his personal vanity and travel fever, were to be satisfied by the invitation to London he has always sought, this might induce him to consider more substantial concessions. It would, of course, have to be made clear to everyone, inparticular the Tunku, that these discussions would be informal, exploratory andconfined to points directly at issue between Indonesia and the United kingdom but, if Anglo-Indonesian talks paved the way, it might prove much easier to arrangetalks between Indonesia and Malaysia on terms acceptable to both sides.A special United Kingdom envoy to Indonesia13. It is quite clear that, for a variety of reasons, the Indonesians have no intention of dealing with Mr. Gilchrist. If we could not consider inviting PresidentSukarno or some other Indonesian to London, an alternative might be to send aspecial envoy to Indonesia. To make any impact, however, it would be necessaryto send a senior Minister (Indonesians are quite accustomed to visits by the presidents and Prime Ministers of other countries). This would look far more likeappeasement than inviting an Indonesian to visit London.
