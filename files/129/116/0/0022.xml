CONFSDEMT8AL93ggH(THIS DOCUMENT 3S THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department........On Thursday this week I have to answer a Question by Sir JohnEden, who asks what further consideration has been given to the need ofsmall traders to be allowed to keep their shops open for longer hours.The Question will be reached for oral answer.    There is anotherQuestion on shop closing hours down for answer next week.    Therenev/ed interest in this subject is obviously prompted by the statement on resale price maintenance.2. The present law on shop closing hours is in the Shops Act 1950,which was a consolidating measure.    It includes also provisions relatingto the employment of adult shop assistants (weekly half holidays,intervals for meals and Sunday employment), the working hours ofjuveniles, and Sunday trading.    The Act has many serious defects.An attempt to remedy them was made in the Shops Bill of 1956, whichwas based on recommendations in the Gowers Committee Report onthe Closing Hours of Shops, modified after exhaustive consultation withthe shopkeepers&apos; associations, trade unions and local authorities.    TheCabinet may recollect that the Bill passed through the House of Lordsafter prolonged debate and disagreement on its detailed provisions, andthat the Government decided not to proceed with it in the Commons.3. In July, I960 my predecessor reported to the Cabinet(C.(60) 109) the conclusion then reached by the Home Affairs Committeethat, in the light of experience of the Shops Bill, reform of the statutoryrestrictions on weekday shop hours was not practical politics.    it seemed clear that the restrictions were no longer needed for theprotection of shop assistants or small shopkeepers;&apos;   and the right course appeared to be to repeal them outright.    Since, however,repeal was likely to be controversial, it was proposed that politicalsoundings should be taken before a final decision was reached.    Thiswas done, and there was strong support from our side of the house for outright repeal.    The Home   Office proposed to include thenecessary provisions in the Offices, Shops and Railway PremisesBill of last Session; but objections were seen to dealing with the two matters in the one Bill.copy NO. -21st January, 1964CABINETSHOP CLOSING HOURS-1-
4. This opportunity having gone, I have felt that the matter mustwait for the next Parliament.    There has recently been no great pressure for legislation.   Small traders have not been asking me to beallowed to keep their shops open for longer hours; indeed, the pressure in years gone by was for earlier closing, and the Shops Bill made provision for this.5. But in the changed situation created by our decision to legislateagainst resale price maintenance I do not think it would be wise to saysimply that v/e have no proposals for legislation about shop hours.    Ihave in mind therefore to reply to Thursday&apos;s question that I proposeto invite the up-to-date views of interested organisations, including representatives of shopkeepers, trade unions, consumers and localauthorities, as to the need, if any, for further legislation: but thatthere is no intention to legislate on the subject in the present Parliament.6. I will then bring the &quot;matter before the Home Affairs Committeeagain in due course.    But in the meantime I shall be grateful for theapproval of my colleagues to the line I propose to take in answeringQuestions.H.B.Home Office, S.V/.1.21st January, 1964-2-
