THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1964CP. (64) 7 Copy No. 607th January, 1964CABINETRATESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general and the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh AffairsWe were asked to submit a paper on rates for early discussion by the Cabinet.This paper deals only with England and Wales.Total rate-call2. This year (i.e., 1963-64) the total collected in rates is expected to be about 931 million, of which domestic ratepayers will contribute rather less than one-half.This represents an increase of more than  80 million over the amount collected in 1962-63, which in its turn showed a similar increase. In fact every year sincethe war has seen an increase in the amount collected in rates; but whereas it tookfrom 1945-46 to 1955-56 for the total to rise from  221&apos;million to  400 million,it has more than doubled in the eight years since.3. It is clear that a further substantial increase must be expected next year.Comprehensive estimates of expenditure are not available, but estimates for thegeneral grant services (education, local health, fire, child care, etc.) show anincrease of not far short of .11 per cent compared with the current year. Rather morethan one-half of this increase would be the result of development of services, andthe rest, of increases in pay and other costs. Education accounts for about 37 percent of all expenditure met from rates.4. The increase in total rate-call would probably be rather less than this, say10 per cent, since expenditure on the general grant services has tended to growrather faster than on local services generally. The natural growth of rateable valueaverages about 2\ per cent per annum, so that finding this amount of money wouldinvolve an increase in individual ratepayers&apos; bills of about 1\ per cent.5. This figure is very much an average. What happens in the individualrating area may be very different; it will be affected, not only by what is likely tobe spent next year, but by the outturn of the present year, the state of balances andby electoral considerations. Experience suggests that there will be some areas wherethe increase in rate-call will be as much as 20 per cent; and at the other extremesome areas will probably show a small decrease.Impact on the individual6. The impact of rates on householders up and down the country is nowbeing studied by the Committee under Professor R. D. G. Allen, with particular regard to circumstances likely to lead to hardship. It became clear early in the inquiry that an extensive survey would be necessary to provide the information which the Committee needed to do their job. The field work was carried out in theautumn, but the work of processing the data will not be complete before the endof March, and it is likely to be May or June before the Committee&apos;s report is inour hands.3731
--(Certain-iacts.-are-however-,clear-from  the data already available. The first is that rates meet rather less than &quot;one-half of local authorities&apos; net expenditure.;!As house property produces less than one-half of the total rate income, this means that householders pay in rates less than one-quarter of the cost of local services.8. Second, taking the country as a whole, the burden of rates on the averagehouseholders is probably no heavier than before the war when allowance is madefor the Mange in the purchasing power of money. In 1931 rates on dwellings inEngland and Wales averaged nearly  10; the corresponding figure this year is 30 12s.9. Third, householders in some areas pay much more in rates than those inother areas. Of 1,467 rating areas, there are over 400 where the average householder^rate bill is above the national average of  30, and in 40 of them it is above  50; atthe other extreme there are almost 400 areas where the average payment is  20 ayear or less. To some extent it is probably true that the higher-rated areas have thericher householders, but by no means always. A proper assessment must await thereport of the Allen Committee.10. A fourth point of importance is that the bulk of the complaints aboutrates come from a relatively small group of areas, in particular, coastal resorts andother districts favoured by retired people. They are areas where rate bills tend tobe high because there is little or no industry to carry part of the burden, and theassistance received from Exchequer grants is below average. The revaluation hasin many cases meant sharp increases in rates, which have to be met by people livingon fixed incomes whose living standards are already being eroded by inflation.Rising rates are only one of the factors at work.11. The Bill already before the House is aimed at giving interim relief to this last category. It provides for extra grants to rating authorities with high proportions of elderly people. It also gives rating authorities discretion to give relief in 1964-65&apos;(and after) from hardship caused by exceptional rate increases associated withrevaluation. The Exchequer will bear at least half, and in some cases up to two-thirds of the cost of this relief of hardship.Conclusion12. It will be seen from paragraph 4 that it would cost  90 to  100 million topin rates in 1964-65 to this year&apos;s level. But even if the Government were preparedto find such a sum, or a proportion of it, it would not be possible to gauge how mucheach authority would need to keep its rates from rising, and to direct the moneyto the right quarters. If additional Exchequer money were to be given to localgovernment in anticipation of next April&apos;s rate-call, it could only be givenindiscriminately to lightly-rated areas as well as to those where the burden is heavy.Rush legislation would be necessary if the assistance were to affect the rate demands for 1964-65. It seems to us that we simply cannot contemplate this; and that in any event to do so on the eve of an Election would look disreputable.13. Nor is there in our view any need to contemplate anything more than thepower to relieve individual hardship which is given in the Rating (Interim Relief) Billalready introduced. There can and no doubt there will be argument aboutwhether that goes far enough; it is limited to cases where there has been a steepincrease due to the revaluation. But the principle of the Bill, directing help whereand only where the real trouble is, must be the right one for an interim measure which is all we can manage at the moment. Meanwhile rate revenue appears to becoming in normally, and the number of appeals lodged against the new valuationlists is actually lower than at the corresponding stage after the 1956 revaluation,which operated to the advantage of householders. Despite all the heat whichrevaluation has generated, evidence of actual hardship is hard to find; and if thereis.any, the Bill will deal with it.The review14. Now that the Bill is published, our supporters are above all worriedabout the trend. They fear that, while relief may be given to those in trouble atthe moment, the inexorable growth of rates is a dominant worry of the independentelderly. They look to us therefore to conduct a thorough-going review of thefinancial basis of local government in the light of inevitably rising expenditure.
15. This we have already undertaken to do. The review will include thepossibility of the centre taking over some more functions from local authorities,e.g., teacher training. We shall need to estimate the likely growth of local authority expenditure and receipts, and in the light of that estimate to consider the adequacy of present sources of finance. This will involve examination of the effectiveness ofthe rating system and the scope for possible improvement, and of the possibilityof additional sources of revenue; as well as consideration of the case of changing the proportion of local authority expenditure financed from the Exchequer andchanging the grant structure. Throughout we have to bear in mind the need to preserve the independence and efficiency of local government. The review must bean internal one with the Treasury and the Local Government Departments in the lead, though the local authorities will have to be consulted at the appropriatestages.16. If we give sufficient publicity to the fact that we are undertaking this review we shall, in our view, do much to reassure those of our supporters whoare genuinely worried about the system. But an undertaking of this sort, properlycarried out, is bound to take time and there is no prospect of reaching evenprovisional conclusions before the Election, particularly as some of the essentialmaterial will not be available until the Allen Committee have completed theirjob. We must avoid, meanwhile, allowing the impression to spread that the reviewis bound to lead to a substantial switch from rates to taxes. Some of the points made in this paper still need to be more generally understood.J. A. B.-C.K. J.6th January, 1964.
