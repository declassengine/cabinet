V/.114th February, 1964
SOUTHERN RHODES IAN INDEPENDENTMemorandum by the Chairman of theDefence and Oversea Policy (Official) CommESteeBACKGROUNDIn talks with British Ministers during his recent visit toLondon, the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. WinstonField, stressed that with the approaching independence of nyasaland, independence for Southern Rhodesia was now an urgent and pressing issue.   While he would like SouthernRhodesia to remain within the Commonwealth, he would beprepared to forego this, if necessary, as the price of independ-ence.   Southern Bhodesia did, however, value her links withthe Crown and with britain.2.      Mr. Field rejected the proposal previously made by theCommonwealth Secretary that the question of Southern Rhodesia8 independence should be informally discussed with representativesof a few selected Commonwealth countries, but said that hewould welcome visits to Southern Rhodesia by representativesof Old Commonwealth Governments individually.   The Common-wealth Secretary has since communicated with the external affairs Ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealand,pressing them to arrange for such visits, asking them toexercise such moderating influence as they can on Mr. field and seeking their views generally.3.      Mr. Field presented the Commonwealth Secretary witha memorandum which, after developing Southern Rhodesia!scase for immediate independence, set out what he described as the maximum conditions which he was prepared to put to his cabinet in return for an undertaking from the Eritish Govern-ment that they would grant independence without delay.These were :-(a) Discrimination on grounds of race alone to beoutlawed in all public places;(b) The L.and Apportionment Act to be repealedprogressively in stages;(c) The property qualifications for the &apos;A&apos; Roll tobe modified;(d) The !B&apos; Roll to be enlarged to permit universaladult suffrage, and cross voting to be abolished.4.       Considering these proposals in turn, items (a) and (b)above go rather less far than what Sir Edgar Whitehead promisedat the last election.   Item (c) would be designed to bring anumber of African farmers on to the &apos;A&apos; Roll but would do nothing-1-
to shorten the time before the Africans could hope to gain amajority in Parliament.   As regards item (d), the enlargement of the &apos;B! Roll franchise would not give the Africans a singleextra^afce&apos;, while the abolition of cross voting would in factrestrict the influence which the Africans might bring to bear inan election.5.       The Commonwealth Secretary told Mr. Field that v/erecognised that recent events in Sast and West Africa hadstrengthened the case for caution.   We were, however, con-cerned about the possible reactions of other members of theCommonwealth.   While the British Government accepted thattheir&apos;s was the ultimate responsibility for any decision to grant independence, they were not prepared to take any action whichmight result in resignations from the Commonwealth.   Theproposals which Mr. Field had put forward would not resolvethis problem.6.      Mr. Field returned to Salisbury against the background of persistent reports that the Right Wing of his party wereintending to supplant him as Prime Minister if he did not bring back an assurance of independence on terms acceptable to them0For the moment at any rate Mr. Field appears to have weatheredthe storm and has stated that reports of a crisis within hisGovernment were &quot;a figment of the imagination&quot;.   He has also stated that he would continue negotiations on independence withthe British Government up to the point where no further negotiation was possible, and that that point had not yet beenreached.7.       On his arrival in Salisbury Mr. Field stated that theBritish Government had agreed that Southern Rhodesia should nolonger be called a Colony.   This was a consequence of an assurance given to Mr. Field by the Commonwealth secretary that so far as possible the use of the term &quot;Colony&quot; would be avoided in the future when referring to Southern Rhodesia.   Asthe Commonwealth Secretary stated in the House on 11th February,there is no constitutional significance in this.   It is the usual practice to avoid so far as possible the use of the term &quot;Colony&quot;when referring to territories which have reached an advanced stage of internal self-government.8.       In the light of recent events it seems most unlikely thatMr. Field will have been granted any more room for manoeuvreby his Cabinet and Party than they have so far given him.   Hehas now sent the Commonwealth Secretary the letter at Annex Ain which he asks for the British Governments views on his personal proposals as summarised in paragraph 3 above for the granting of independence to Southern Rhodesia. He has asked fora reply to his letter by 18th February when he returns from aholidy in South Africa.   The Southern Pjiodesia parliament meetson 25th February,-2-SEGSftET
FUTURE prospects .       If the decision is taken to confirm to Mr. Field thatthe British Government are not able to grant independence on thebasis of his proposals, and if no new element can be injectedinto the situation, the Southern Rhodesian Government will be faced with two alternatives -(a) To decide not to pursue the question of independence for the time being;  or(b) to declare Southern Rhodesia&apos;s independenceunilaterally.   There are several ways in whichthis might be done which are set out inparagraph 11 below.10.       Jf cotirse (a) were adopted, there is a risk that thesituation might continue to deteriorate.   On the other hand, theinternal situation might develop favourably and we should then have time to. exert our influence on moderate European opinion in Southern Rhodesia to prevent unconstitutional action beingtaken, and to persuade the African population to play a more constructive role.   While it will be very difficult for the presentSouthern Rhodesian Government to play the issue long, it is greatly in our interest that they should do so and it should be our primary objective to move them in this direction.   We turnlater to the means by which we might achieve this aim.11.      Before adopting course (b) the Southern rhodesian government might press further their request for independence on the terms now proposed by Mr. Field.   Ministers xvillprobably continue to find these terms unacceptable and there seems no room for negotiation on them.   Moreover, there is nofurther constitutional step short of full independence which couldbe offered as an alternative.12.     If they decided to adopt course (b) the Southern EhodesianGovernment might declare themselves independent while continuing to recognise the Queen as Head of State.   They might then go on to pass legislation purporting to validate theirdeclaration of independence.   Alternatively, they might breakaway entirely, abandoning their allegiance to the Queen andplacing themselves in a state of open revolt.CONSEQUENCES OF A UNILATERAL DECLARATION of independence&quot; - &quot;       &quot;13.      The constitutional and legal consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence are set out at Annex B.14.     A simple declaration of independence with or without legislation in the Southern Rhodesian Parliament would not makeSouthern Rhodesia legally independent unless the necessary-3-
legislation were passed by the British Parliament.   Ti wedeclined to do this, we could take the view that the southern rhodesian action had no validity, ignore it, and go on as before.But we have reached the conclusion, for the reasons given below,that such a state of affairs could not last long.15.     In the first place, the position of the Sovereign would be bound to be raised and the Queen might have to be advised thatas a result of Southern Rhodesia^ actions, she could no longerremain as Queen over Southern Rhodesia.   This might be on theground that to do so would be tantamount to countenancing therepudiation by Southern Rhodesia of the powers of the UnitedKingdom Parliament, or because of protests from other commonwealth countries on constitutional grounds.16.     Moreover, apart from the constitutional consequences ofthe Southern Rhodesian Government declaring their independenceunilaterally, certain practical consequences would followquickly and almost inevitably.   The following are examples -(i) International reaction would be sharp and violent.The issue would be raised immediately in theUnited Nations, probably in the Security Council,particularly in view of statements which have beenmade by Ministers in Parliament and consequentlyin the United Nations about the conditions on which britain would be prepared to grant independence to Southern Rhodesia.   The Old commonwealth countries would be deeply disturbed and the attitudeof the New Commonwealth, particularly in Africa,would be one of extreme hostility to SouthernRhodesia.(ii)  Leaving Britain aside, other countries with thepossible exceptions of South Africa and Portugal,would refuse to have relations with SouthernRhodesia.(iii)  Economic relations with Northern Rhodesia wouldbe disturbed or broken, and Southern rhodesia would be forced inevitably to look towards SouthAfrica.   Northern Rhodesia might cancelarrangements for the joint power, railways andair boards which are at present contemplated;the United Kingdom would then be faced with serious financial loss because the Governmenthave guaranteed loans by the International bank for R.econstruction and Development for theKariba Dam and for Rhodesia Railways amountingto  37 million in all and in addition the colonial development Corporation has invested  15 million in the dam.-4-
(iv) Southern Rhodesia would be faced with an internal security situation (which for the timebeing at least she could probably deal witheffectively although not without repressivemeasures which would produce a stronginternational reaction.(v) The Southern Rhodesian African nationalistswould set up a government in exile, probably ina neighbouring Commonwealth country, which many countries would recognise; SouthernRhodesia would become increasingly a target of subversion by other African States.17.     The cumulative effect on us of these pressures might lead to a serious breach in our constitutional and political relations with Southern Rhodesia.   The main legalconsequences would be:-(i) Southern Rhodesia would no longer remain part ofHer Majesty&apos;s dominions, and Southern Rhodesiancwould no longer owe allegiance to the Queen,(ii) A number of Acts would therefore cease to apply toher.   In particular she would no longpr be withinthe Commonwealth Preference area unless theImport Duties Act were expressly amended toinclude her,(iii)  The British Nationality Act would have to be amended to remove Southern Rhodesians from the category of &quot;British subjects or Commonwealth citizens&quot;(assuming she were no longer within the Commonwealth).(iv) The whole basis of the Southern Rhodesian constitution would go and she would have to give herself a new-constitution presumably by forming a ConstituentAssembly for the purpose.18,      The consequences of a breach for our trade with southern Rhodesia would be complex and require further study.If Commonwealth Preference ceased on both sides, there wouldbe implications for the Southern Rhodesian tobacco crop andBritish exports to Southern Rhodesia would also be affected.At present British imports from Southern Rhodesia amount tosome  30 million a year, of which  20 million is in respectof tobacco.   British exports to Southern Rhodesia consist mainly of engineering, textile and electrical products and motorcars and amount to about  35 million a year.   In the financialfield United Kingdom aid to Southern Rhodesia is comparatively small, amounting to less than  10 million.   However, duringnegotiations for the break up of the Rhodesian Federation weundertook to examine the financial situation, with the implication that we might have to give Southern Rhodesia additionalfinancial assistance.   Presumably we could not continue to give-5-
Southern Rhodesia financial assistance and such indirectmilitary assistance as we still provide would also cease.   but one of the consequences of our failure to continue aid might bethat the Southern Rhodesian Government would repudiate theirexternal debt amounting to some  80 million.   On the otherhand, before taking such a step they would have to take intoaccount the possibility of our taking action to exclude SouthernRhodesia from the Sterling Area although they would realise that we have not taken such action in the case of South Africa;exclusion would inter alia subject the movement of capital fromthis country to Southern Rhodesia to exchange control.   a detailed examination of the economic and financial implications of Southern Rhodesia declaring her independence is at present being undertaken by officials.19.     In the light of what he has already said, Mr. Fieldwould hope that on independence Southern Rhodesia would betreated by Britain &quot;as well as she treated South Africa&quot;.   Theposition of Southern Rhodesia would not be parallel to that ofSouth Africa, which was already independent when she left the Commonwealth on terms which were mutually agreed bythe other Commonwealth Governments.20.     In any case, like South Africa, Southern Rhodesiamight find herself debarred from various Commonwealthactivities, including the routine supply of information on international affairs, defence and security liaison and member-ship of expert committees.21.      There would be serious difficulties in respect of theHigh Commission Territories.   While their economies mightsuffer some damage the most important implications wouldbe in the defence field.   At least so long as we are responsiblefor the High Commission Territories and possibly thereafter,we must be able to move troops into thern and for this wedepend to a large degree on the use of Salisbury for long rangeaircraft.   While the airfields in Northern Rhodesia can providelimited facilities, there is no guarantee that particularly after independence, these will be available for this purpose.THIS POSITION OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT22,     In the light of these considerations, our first andprimary objective should be to prevent a declaration of independence by Southern Rhodesia, and to this end werecommend that the full extent of the consequent difficulties should be brought home to Mr. Field and his Ministers as quickly and as forcibly as possible.   The position of theBritish Government on the major issues of concern to southern Rhodesia should be made quite clea.r in confidence,especially that we see no way in which the Queen could properly remain as Head of State in a Southern Rhodesia whichhad declared itself unilaterally independent.23.     We might also try in other ways to bring home to southern Rhodesian public opinion some of the consequences whichwill necessarily flow from any action they take to declarethemselves independent,-6 -
There is an influential body of European opinion in SouthernRhodesia which is strongly opposed to unconstitutional action;there are probably many other Europeans whose attitude wouldtuirn on the attitude of the United Kingdom.   They would be severely shaken if they knew that they would be regarded by us as being &quot;in rebellion&apos;^ and would have to accept the consequences which flow/ed from it in terms of their relationship with theCrown and with Britain.24.     Cur main objective would be by this means to providemoderate European opinion in Southern Rhodesia with sufficientencouragement to assert itself.   At the same time we shouldtake steps to avoid forfeiting the confidence of Africans both within Southern Rhodesia and outside and to carry theCommonwealth with us.   If these tactics were successful a new situation would have been created.-  25.     If, in spite of all these efforts, the Government ofSouthern Rhodesia declared itself independent, we believe thatthe following would be the only real courses open: -(i)  To take no action, i. e. to ignore what would be anunlawful act.   For the reasons given in this paperwe do not think it would be possible to hold this position for more than a few days at the most, bywhich time we might have lost the opportunity to influence the course of events and would havejeopardised our international standing.(ii)  To legalise the unconstitutional action taken bySouthern Rhodesia and recognise her as independent(with or without the Queen as her Sovereign).   Thiswould involve us in the international odium arousedby Southern Rhodesia&apos;s action; we would split theCommonwealth;  and would have forfeited, probablyirretrievably, the confidence of the Africans.(iii)  To regard the action of the Southern rhodesian government as severing the relationship with britain and consequently with the Crown and theCommonwealth, in which case the consequences would be as indicated in this paper.26.     Before adopted either of the alternatives (ii) and (iii)one final effort might be made by a public statement of theconsequences which must follow a unilateral declaration of independence in the hope that, even at that late stage, pressure of opinion in Southern Rhodesia might cause the Government to reverse its action.
SECRET AND PERSONALFROM:    The prime Minister of Southern RhodesiaTO    :    Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations at the last meeting which we had in London on Friday/the 31st January, I handed you a document which I prepared,at your request, outlining the case for granting SouthernRhodesia full independence within the Commonwealth.As was agreed &quot;between us, our conversations and discussions during that week in London were to he regardedas private and confidential, and especially so since I wasnot there for the purposes of official negotiations with her Majesty&apos;s Government0Having now discussed my visit with my colleagues inthe Cabinet in Salishury and with members of my Party inthe Southern Rhodesian Assembly, I feel it is desirable,for my own position, that I should have a formal decision from Her Majesty&apos;s Government on my personal proposals,I emphasised to you that what I had set out in thememorandum, to which I refer above, represented, not the considered views of my Government, but a course of actionwhich I was prepared to put to them as the terms for a grantby Her Majesty&apos;s Government of full independence to thiscountry,,     The proposals, therefore, are my own at this juncture;   but, in order that I may take matters furtherhere I must have Her Majesty&apos;s Governments decision on theseproposals.     What I want to know is whether the BritishGovernment is prepared to pass the necessary legislation togrant us our full independence if I carry out what I have said I will endeavour to do in the memorandum.I am asking the Southern Rhodesia High commissioner in London to deliver this message to you and to emphasise,once again, my point of view and to request the favour ofyour answer, in writing, giving me the decision ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government by 18th February, on which date Ireturn from a few days&apos; holiday in the Cape.Office of the Prime Ministerof Southern RhodesiaSECRET AND PERSONAL
-1-SES1ETLegal Effect of &quot;Independence&quot;A. - Present Constitutional position .     The provisions of the Southern Rhodesia Constitutionaffecting the position of the Sovereign and the Governor canonly he altered &quot;by Her Majesty in Council, i.e. on the advice of the Secretary of State.     These- provisions, briefly summarised, are -Section 1 .     Governor appointed by Commission under HerMajesty7^ Sign Manual and Signet.     Holds office during her majesty&apos;s pleasure.     The Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesiais to be consulted before any appointment is made.     TheGovernor takes an oath of allegiance to The Queen, and an oaththat he will well and truly serve The Queen in the officeof Governor.Section 2.     Subject to the provisions of the Constitution andof any lav/, the Governor is to perform his functions in accordancewith such Instructions as The Queen may give (instructionsrequire the Governor to preside over the Governor&apos;s Council,lay down the procedure for considering capital cases, providefor the use of the Public Seal, and require him not to leavethe territory without The Queen&apos;s permission),,Section 5 provides for the appointment by Commission of anActing Governor (in case the Governor is unable to perform his functions due to absence or other cause) after consultation asin Section 1 .      (The Commission appoints the Chief justice of Southern Rhodesia, and, falling him, the Senior Judge, tobe Acting Governor.)     The Acting Governor must take the oathsmentioned in Section 1 .Section 5.     Salary and allowances of the Governor.Section 6.     The Legislature &quot;shall consist of Her majesty and a Legislative Assembly&quot;.Section 29.     No Bill is to become law until the Governor hasassented thereto in Her Majesty &apos;s name and on Her behalf, (or hasreserved it for The Queen&apos;s assent in the case mentioned inparagraph 2).     The Governor must declare whether he assentsor refuses assent (and under Section h5 he must act inaccordance with the advice of his Ministers),Section &quot;;2 enables The Queen to disallow Acts which eitheroperate to the detriment of stockholders holding stock registered under the Colonial Stock Acts, or are inconsistent with treaty obligations.Section U2 vests executive authority in The Queen;    it may beexercised on The Queen&apos;s behalf by the Governor, or such other persons as may be authorised by the Governor or by any law.Section 1+9.     The Governor may in The Queen&apos;s name and on Herbehalf exercise the prerogative of mercy.
2,     A number of the provisions of the Constitution areentrenched;    that is to say, they may not he amended withouta referendum, or alternatively approval by Her Majesty (onwhich the Secretary of State would advise).     Subject to this,all provisions of the Constitution, except those enumerated in the preceding paragraph may he added to, amended or repealedby an Act of the Legislature passed with a two-thirds majority.3.     Southern Rhodesia is, of course, subject to any Act passedby the Parliament of the United Kingdom;    and to Section 2 ofthe Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865* under which any law ofSouthern Rhodesia repugnant to any Act of the United kingdom parliament is void.h.      Other legal consequences flow from Southern Rhodesia&apos;position as a part of Her Majesty&apos;s dominions, and a territorywithin the Commonwealth;   for example, under Section 2 of theImport Duties Act 1958 she is within the Commonwealth PreferenceArea as part of Her Majesty&apos;s dominions;    she is a countrynamed in Section 1 (3) of the British Nationality Act 19^8,and has her own citizenship law, so that by virtue of these provisions Southern Rhodesia are British subjects or commonwealth citizens;     here are numerous other Acts affectingher as part of Her Majesty&apos;s dominions.5.     The British Government is responsible for SouthernRhodesia&apos;s external relations, and she has only such limited powers of entering into agreements with other countries as areentrusted to her by the British Government,     It is intendedto entrust to her power to enter freely into agreements withother Commonwealth countries;    and with foreign countriessubject to the British Government&apos;s approval of the agreement.She is also to be allowed to have High Commissioners in commonwealth countries and consular representatives in foreigncountries (in South Africa she can have diplomatic representa-tives, the senior to have the status of an Ambassador).B. - Independence by Constitutional Means6.     An Independence Act would he passed &quot;by the United kingdom parliament in the usual way, abrogating the limitations onSouthern Rhodesia&apos;s sovereignty stated in paragraphs 1 to above.      (The limitation in paragraph 5 would fall away.)C. - Independence by Unconstitutional Means7.     If Southern Rhodesia were merely to issue a declarationof independence, it would, of course, have no legal effect,and the above position would not legally he altered in any way.If Southern Rhodesia were to pass an Act purportingspecifically tc abrogate any of the limitations inparagraphs 1 to 3, it also would have no effect in law.     Forexample, no Act attempting to alter the sections of theConstitution enumerated in paragraph 1 would have any effect.Nor would any Act purporting in general terms to make SouthernRhodesia &quot;independent&quot; have any legal effect.-2-
8.     On the assumption that there were no attempt to withdrawallegiance to The Queen, any legal difficulties arising out of unilateral action are likely to relate -(a)   to the appointment and position of the Governorj    and(h)    to the power of disallowance under Section 32.Southern Rhodesia would obviously use the referendum procedure for any amendments of entrenched provisions, so there would heno reserved Bills.9.     As to (a), the Commission appointing the Governor is signed by Her Majesty and countersigned by the Secretary of State.The Constitution does not contain an express requirement thatthe Governor is to be appointed on the advice of the Secretaryof State, this results from the general constitutional position;but the provision for consultation with the Southern RhodesiaPrime Minister clearly implies this requirement.     If however the Southern Rhodesia Government has unilaterally declaredindependence, she is not likely to accept a Governor appointed on the advice of the Secretary of State, even assuming that thelatter would feel able to advise The Queen on the appointmentin such circumstances.     The Secretary of State could not advise the Queen that his advice was not necessary on the appointment,since, apart from anything else, that would mean our acceptanceof the unilateral declaration of independence.10.    The Governor would be in grave difficulty as soon as any bill were presented to him for his assent deriving in any way from the notion of &quot;independence&quot;.     In particular, any Billpurporting to amend any provision set out in paragraph 1  abovey/ould be invalid.     The (Governor would be placed in the dilemmaof either observing that part of the Constitution which requireshim to assent to a Bill if so advised by the Southern RhodesiaMinisters, or observing the other part which would render anysuch Act invalid.     Other embarrassments to the Governor wouldhe likely to follow from the requirement of the Constitutionthat he is to act in accordance with the advice of SouthernRhodesia Ministers.11.    As to (b), if the Southern Rhodesia Legislature were topass an Act contrary e.g. to a treaty obligation, the Secretaryof State would have to advise The Queen to disallow it, and she would presumably do so.     In this event, the law would cease tohave effect, though it would presumably still be regarded asin operation hy the Southern Rhodesia Government.Legal Adviser,Commonwealth Relations office Oth February, 196k-3-SECKETD. - Constitutional difficulties arising from C
