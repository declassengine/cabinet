PRIME MINISTERResale Price MaintenanceToday&apos;s &quot;Times&quot; reports that in my address to the1922 Committee last night I created the impression that the onus of proof for showing that resale price maintenance isin the public interest might be shifted to the Board of Trade.2.       You may like to know that this report, which did notappear in any other press account of the Committee&apos;sproceedings, is totally inaccurate.    I said nothing to suggestthat the Government were preparing to move the onus of proofand I maintained completely the position agreed in cabinet and set out in my statement to the House on Wednesday,15th January.    The Chief Whip tells me that the Whipsconfirm this.3.       Incidentally, I understand from the Lord Chancellorthat it would, in fact, be quite impracticable to draft an effective Bill in such a way as to put the onus of proof on tothe Board of Trade.4.       I am sending a copy of this minute to the minister without Portfolio.(Signed)  EDWARD HEATHBoard of Trade, S. W. 1.24th January, 1964
