CONFIDENTIALiflf DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. February 1964CP. (64) 45 Copy No.      6514th February, 1964CABINETSOUTH-EAST STUDY: MACHINERY FOR IMPLEMENTINGMAJOR development memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand Minister for Welsh affairs in circulating the draft White Paper which is to cover the South-East study the Secretary of State for Regional Development has said that paragraph r8 aboutthe machinery for implementation will need discussion by the Cabinet.2. There is in fact a big issue of policy concealed here, involving our wholeattitude both to land and to regional development agencies (on both of which weare under fire); and it is for consideration whether we ought not to write a gooddeal more into the White Paper than has so far been suggested.The major developments3. The point arising on the Study is this. It is envisaged that about two-thirds of the growth expected in the South-East can be looked after by the normal processof getting the planning authorities to allocate enough land, and so enablingdevelopers, mainly private, to meet the demand for building to match the growth.4. But over the 20 years there will be nearly 1^ million people who have gotto be moved out of London, or who, drawn to the South-East from elsewhere bythe pull of employment, have got to be dissuaded from making for London bythe provision of alternative centres of growth.5. The Study suggests that the only effective way to gather up these people and to settle them where there will be work as well as homes, is to organise a fewmajor development schemes by way of more new towns, and of big expansionsof existing towns. Such schemes might be expected to exert a real pull away from london.6.   The question is how such major development schemes should be organised.Public ownership and public agencies7. I take the view, and the Regional Development Committee agreed generally(though with some dissentients) that these schemes must be organised on the basisof public ownership of the land, in the hands of public agencies empowered to seethat the necessary development takes place as it is required, whether carried out by private developers, by local authorities or by the agencies themselves.8. This of course is what happens now in new towns, and the machineryexists. All I am proposing is that we should envisage a similar machinery to see.through the few really big expansions of existing towns, though here acting in partnership with the authorities of these towns.9. There are two issues here. The first is whether the conception of public ownership and public agencies is right. The second is whether if it is right it shouldnot in any case be left to the local authorities.3949
, 10. On the first, the argument is that these major development schemes \(bgot to be planned and phased. Freeholds have to be amalgamated to ensur^ranoverall and comprehensive plan. Further, unless the land is publicly owned, andowned by an agency whose business is to see that development takes place whenit is required and for the purposes for which it is required, the schemes will notmature at the pace related to our priorities elsewhere and in the form needed.And they are vital to the better distribution of employment and populationthroughout the South-East which is a main object of the Study.11. There is another argument. Unless the land is publicly owned the appreciation in value due to its being planned for large-scale development will allremain in private hands. Speculators will buy it; and once we get employmentexpanding in these places, prices for building land could go very high. public expenditure will be needed on the provision of roads, water and sewerage, and thiswill increase the value of the land. If the land is publicly owned the cost of theservices can be recouped by subsequent disposal for development or, if necessary,by public development. This has happened in the new towns. But if the land is left in private hands the value created by the public expenditure will all go to the owners,some of whom will have bought simply to cash in.12. We are under heavy fire from the Opposition about land prices and theprofits being made out of land by private owners, including speculators. There isa good deal of feeling about this within our own party. I am discussing with theChancellor whether there is anything we could and should do to recover someof the betterment due to planning or of the profits from land transactions. but whatever may come out of that, we shall be heavily criticised if, where we are proposing deliberately, by our own initiative, to induce major development, wedo not secure both control over the prices at which the land is disposed of for development, and a profit for the public sufficient to recoup the expenditure whichthe public must incur.13.- The Opposition would certainly do this; and indeed would go much further. They would buy not just the land needed for the big developments whichhave to be induced, but all the land released for development that is all the landfor the 3\ million population growth covered by the Study; and there is a gooddeal of public sympathy with that approach.14. Public acquisition of the land required for the major developments doesnot mean that the land will therefore be publicly developed. Nor does it mean that the land must remain in public ownership. I envisage that a great deal of thedevelopment will be private, on land sold or leased for the purpose by the ownershipagency. All the development indeed could be private if private developers will do what is needed when it is needed; though, as much of the housing will have tobe rented, and rented to the people for whom these new developments are intended,it is likely that much of it will have to be undertaken by public authorities orhousing associations. But this is a separate and subsequent question. All this canbe suitably emphasised.Local authorities15. If it is agreed that the major developments should proceed on the basisof public ownership and public agencies, the next question is whether, in the bigexpansions of existing towns, we should proceed, as I propose, on the basis of town expansion corporations, corresponding to new town corporations andappointed by the Government, or should rely on the local authorities.16. I still have to discuss with the local authorities exactly what thearrangements should be. They will want to take some part in the expansions oftheir towns. But we could not rely on them to see through such big expansions,to a time-table dictated by regional and national considerations. Nor would they feel able to finance the advance acquisition of the land and the necessary provisionof the public services, without substantial Exchequer assistance. If the exchequer has to find money the Government should own the land in order to recoup. Butthe main argument for the Government undertaking the responsibility is that only so can we control the timing of the developments and ensure that it servesthe purposes for which it is intended.
MB 17. My colleagues will be aware that we are being much criticised for hayingrefused to endorse Sir Geoffrey Crowther&apos;s proposal, made on the BuchananReport, for regional development agencies to carry through traffic improvements in the towns. The Minister of Transport and I have maintained that this isproperly a job for local government. When it comes to controlling and promotingmajor new developments to secure a better distribution of employment and population there is a real case for regional development agencies; for I envisagesingle agencies to carry through a group of expansions in order to phase these developments. This would give us the opportunity to show ourselves ready to have such agencies when the need exists.Conclusion18. I ask my colleagues to agree that major developments required to buildup new centres which will pull growth away from London should be carried outon the basis of public ownership in the hands of public agencies (new town or townexpansion corporations) whose job it will be to see that development takes place as and when it is needed.19. If this is agreed, I seek the views of my colleagues on the question whetherthe policy should be spelled out more fully in the White Paper. We shall certainly be questioned about it. We shall be questioned even if the White Paper says nothing.20. If it thought that we should spell it out at greater length we have toconsider whether it would be best to present the policy as no great innovation simply a logical extension of new town activity and of what local authorities alreadydo, to a limited extent, when expanding their towns; or as a new initiative designedon the one hand to control programming and on the other to reduce speculationand to recover betterment from these major public initiatives.K.
