S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 2929th January, 1964CABINETCHANNEL tunnel memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 23rd January the Cabinet (CM. (64) 6th Conclusions, Item 7) agreedthat the Minister of Transport and I would consider the terms in whichthe Governmenfs attitude towards the channel tunnel might most appropriately be announced; and agreed to resume discussion later. As explained below wehave not been able to agree whether or not an announcement should be issued;and I am therefore circulating this memorandum.2. I am convinced that it is essential to make an announcement of theGovernments tentative decision, subject to further discussions with the French,before these discussions start. With further delay there would be a serious dangerof a leak which, in view of the number of financial interests involved wouldcertainly lead to major stock exchange speculation.3. The Minister of Transport believes that nothing should be said beforeofficials have further talks with the French on the grounds that the french have accepted the proposal that any announcement in principle should be madejointly. I believe, however, that this can be met provided that we do not announceany acceptance in principle at this stage; and indeed, the terms of the statement by Monsieur Jacquet, French Minister of Transport, on 30th October, 1963, tothe National Assembly show that there is room for some announcement in viewof the exigencies of the situation on this side of the channel in terms which wouldnot give the French any room for objection.4. I accordingly propose that the announcement should be made in the terms set out below. This form of statement leans very heavily on what the French havealready said, so they can scarcely object:&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that a channel link has been shown to be technically possible and that, in economic terms, it would in the long runrepresent a sound investment of the nation&apos;s resources, They agree, as theFrench Minister of Transport said on 30th October, 1963, that neitherGovernment should reach any firm unilateral decisions on the issues ofprinciple or on the method of construction for work which is of equal interestto both Governments and that the final decision can only be made jointly. .Her Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly propose to discuss the technical and financial problems with the French Government. When these discussions have been completed it should be possible to decide how the cost of. the tunnelcould be met, bearing in mind the very heavy burden of existing commitments and the many other competing claims on national resources and what, in thelight of these, should be the timing of the project.&quot;Private Finance -5. This draft statement says nothing about the organisation or ownership of the channel link, because these are matters which will have to be discussed withthe French. But I must emphasise that there is a grave danger of undesirablespeculation in the shares of companies concerned with the channel link; the BankCopy No.3852
of England strongly supports this view. It is essential to prevent stock exchil pspeculation of a kind which could be very damaging both politically and to thechannel link. The reason is this. In view of the vital public utility significance of achannel link if it is constructed, the two Governments would inevitably have tosee through the construction if unforeseen difficulties were encountered; theywould also have to have control over charges, dividends and be in a position todeal with discrimination against a particular group of users. The concept of aprivate equity interest in the ordinary sense does not therefore apply to the channellink. I believe it to be essential therefore that some guidance should be given tothe Press after an announcement on the lines of the draft in paragraph 4. Thisshould be done through the normal channels to indicate that in the United kingdom governments view a private equity interest in the ordinary sense as suggestedby the interests involved in the channel link does not appear to apply; and that avery large degree of public involvement is inevitable.6. It is vital to have clear this question of private finance; if we do not weshall be in serious danger of courting a scandal of a damaging kind. It may be helpful to my colleagues therefore if I set out the position as I see it.7. Private finance means either equity or fixed interest capital. The case against equity is that (a) The two Governments would have to have effective joint control overcharges, dividends and means by which complaints of discrimination against groups of users were investigated. These would have to be laiddown in the original concessionary instrument. In the light of thelongstanding policy of successive United Kingdom Governmentstowards public utilities, which existed long before there was anyquestion of direct public ownership, it is not practicable to imagineotherwise. Yet the imposition of this control makes it improbable that private finance would regard the equity favourably.(b) A great deal of the capital would have to be provided on a fixed interestbasis. The promoters have demanded a guarantee which is the equivalent of a considerable subsidy (for otherwise they would have topay much more if indeed they could raise it all) and would put the riskon the shoulders of the Government. A Government guarantee of thiskind is objectionable on political grounds.8. Apart from the question of subsidy, private fixed interest capital whichneeded a United Kingdom Government guarantee would be just another gilt-edgedsecurity and no more likely to be attractive either at home or abroad than theexisting gilt-edged securities. In other words there is no reason to think that theguarantee would bring in extra stock in the manner hoped for. If, however, therewere no guarantee the rate of interest would be higher as already indicated andthis would itself undermine the basis of the private finance proposed. Apart fromthis it is difficult to see how a private debenture could be secured on what isclearly a major national facility.9. At the same time it has to be recognised that the French Governmentmay nevertheless wish to give a guarantee to some private capital, though probablythis would be carefully controlled, somewhat on what we could call public utilitylines. I should not therefore wish to rule out completely in advance the possibilityof guaranteed bonds in suitable conditions. A joint guarantee by the twoGovernments of an international stock would be a different kind of propositionfrom gilt-edged whether United Kingdom or French. I would therefore wish tofind out in the forthcoming discussions how the French Government would regardsuch a stock. ThiSj however, would be a form of capital very different from anequity interest in the ordinary sense.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,28th January, 1964.
