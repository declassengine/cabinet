Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1964CP. (64) 4011th February, 1964CABINETPAY CLAIM FOR POSTMEN AND POSTMEN HIGHER GRADEMemorandum by the Postmaster-general in December 1963 the Union of Post Office Workers presented a pay claim foran unspecified increase for Postmen and Postmen Higher Grade. These grades arenot covered by the central settlement for the non-industrial civil service.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed last month that the Union couldbe offered a three-year pay agreement similar in form to that proposed for the civilservice, and giving pay increases of 4 per cent, 3\ per cent and 3\ per cent on the1st January, 1964, 1965 and 1966 respectively. The central agreement providedfor annual increases of 3 per cent, 3\ per cent and 3-J per cent, and the largerfirst-year increase proposed for the Post Office grades was mainly because the lastcentral pay settlement dated from 1st April, 1963, while the last increase forPostmen was made three months earlier.3. The Union were accordingly offered a long-term agreement for thePostmen (numbering 115,000) and certain other grades (about 61,000) whoseposition was not covered by the central negotiations; the opening bid was threeannual increases of 3  per cent.4. The Union have told me that, subject to ratification by a special conference, they would be willing to accept this offer for all but the Postmengrades. Here, the Union rejected the offer, saying they cannot hope to persuadetheir Special Conference to accept it. Their attitude is affected by the feeling whichhas existed among Postmen over the last two years, following their industrial actionon pay early in 1962. This was aggravated by what they regard as an unjust awardby the Arbitration Court last year of less than 2 per cent at the Postmen&apos;s maximum.The Union say that Postmen are in no mood to listen to rational arguments. they point out that the general wages index has increased by 4 - 2 per cent since January3 196\ and that staff in many other public services have had substantial pay increases in the last few months.5. My own view is that there would be great advantage in reaching an amicable settlement with the Union if we can. The responsible elements are havingdifficulty in restraining their militant colleagues and we are not getting Unionco-operation. This affects productivity, especially in the postal service, which relieson the willingness of the Postmen force to meet tight timetables: to take upsurgesof traffic in their stride: on occasions to work protracted overtime: and to bescrupulous in their handling of the vast sums of money which now circulate throughthe post.6. I am sure that there is a real risk of industrial trouble if we fail to achieve a settlement, and my instinct is that public opinion would be against us. I feel thatthere is a prospect of agreement on the basis of a 5 per cent offer for the first year.Overall this would mean an average percentage increase of 4^ per cent. We might and I should try hard get a settlement on A\ per cent for the first year. This wouldgive an overall average of 4-2 per cent. I hope my colleagues will agree to an approach on this basis without prejudice.J. R.
