SECRETl^frl   IIiiH11 (JMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 26 Copy No. 6 628th January, 1964CABINETTHE HOLY LOCH MEMORANDUM: CLAIMS AND INDEMNITYPROVISIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister of defence as requested by our colleagues, we have further examined this problem withthe Departments principally concerned. The conclusions which are set out in thisMemorandum have been drawn up in consultation with the Attorney-General.2. The assurances given to Parliament in February 1961 are contained in the annex to this Memorandum. They meant in effect, that claims would be processedin accordance with United Kingdom laws and regulations and that, in determiningliability, the principle of sole and absolute liability of the operator would apply.They also meant that claims were to be met by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in thefirst instance, but 75 per cent was recoverable as of right from the United StatesGovernment. These assurances were given on the basis of the formula then underdiscussion with the United States. When this formula was eventually agreed inNovember 1962, it was put in the form of a statement of intent because of theabsence of United States legislative authority to cover the payment of claims onthe basis proposed. We accepted this as adequately fulfilling the assurances toParliament.3. The NATO Status of Forces Agreement, on which the 1962 formula was based, applies to all United States Forces in this country, including the United StatesPolaris submarines in Holy Loch. Article VIII (5) sets out the procedure for dealingwith &quot; claims . . . arising out of acts or omissions of members of a force or civiliancomponent force in the performance of official duty, or out of any other act, omissionor occurrence for which a force or civilian component is legally responsible, andcausing damage in the territory of the receiving State to third parties, other than any of the Contracting Parties&quot;. The effect of Article VIII (5) (h) is to restrict theapplication of the Agreement in the case of any claim arising out of the navigationor operation of a ship to claims for death and personal injury, excepting even fromthis limited class claims for any members of the armed forces of the receiving Statewho suffered death or injury on duty. In the 1962 formula the United States agreedto waive the limitation to claims for death and personal injury in the case of HolyLoch.4. On liability, the position in the United Kingdom is that, under the atomic energy Authority Act, 1954, and the Nuclear Installations (Licensing and Insurance)Act, 1959, sole and absolute liability is imposed on the Atomic Energy authority and on other operators of land-based nuclear reactors. There is as yet no UnitedKingdom legislation applying the principle of sole and absolute liability to the operators of nuclear ships, but the United States expressly stated their intention,in the 1962 formula, of applying this principle to Holy Loch claims. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have supported the adoption of this principle in the BrusselsConvention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships (1962). In the absenceof the necessary legislation, however, the United Kingdom has not ratified this3837
Convention. A decision to introduce legislation on this subject would affecyanumber of Departments, and we understand that the Minister of Transport is ^convinced of its desirability for merchant ships at the present time. Until, however,such legislation has been enacted (at least in relation to warships),(a) the rights of citizens of this country to recover anything from anybody inrespect of a nuclear accident in a Polaris submarine will remain highlyspeculative;(b) in the absence of any such right in the citizen any settlement of claims by Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be ex gratia and there would therefore be no right to recover from the United States government under the Status of Forces Agreement 75 per cent of the cost of settling any claims and the undertakings given to Parliament inFebruary 1961 would remain at least in part unfulfilled.5. The United States accept, in paragraph 1 of the latest draft Holy LochMemorandum, that the NATO Status of Forces Agreement shall apply &quot; unless otherwise specified in this Memorandum &quot;. However, the new formula they have proposed on claims specifies otherwise by providing that &quot; claims will be dealtwith through diplomatic channels in accordance with customary procedures forthe settlement of international claims under generally accepted principles of lawand equity &quot;. They have offered to add an explanatory phrase to the effect that&quot; the United States Government, at international conferences where this subjecthas been discussed, has supported the principle of sole and absolute liabilitychannelled exclusively to the operator of a nuclear reactor &quot;. The State Departmenthave told the British Embassy in Washington that, in their view, the language of this formula is consistent with the assurances given to Parliament and that,since the principle of sole and absolute liability represents the &quot; best trend in lawand equity &quot;, it would be &quot; encompassed &quot; by this language.6. We do not agree that the new United States formula is consistent withthe assurances to Parliament. Moreover if, as appears to be the United Statesintention, the Holy Loch arrangements were to be excluded from the applicationof the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, an announcement to this effect wouldnave to be made under Section 9 (2) of the Visiting Forces Act, 1952. This would inevitably draw attention to the inconsistency.7. The explanatory phrase about liability in the United States formulaimports no legal obligation on the United States Government. But it is the mostwe are likely to get, since the United States Administration, like us, have nolegislative authority for explicit acceptance of the principle of sole and absolute liability. We therefore see no point in pressing them further on this. On theother hand, we should be justified in taking the line that, since the United Kingdomand the United States are both parties to the NATO Status of Forces Agreement,we intend to rely on this Agreement to the extent to which it is applicable andnave recourse to settlement through diplomatic channels only where the Agreementdoes not apply.8. This conclusion means that we should have to rely on settlement through diplomatic channels of all claims for damage to private property and of all claimstor personal injury and damage to property within the United Kingdom arisingfrom any incident or accident outside British Waters. These are substantialexceptions to the application of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement. They werespecifically waived in the 1962 formula. We see no prospect of getting them waivednow, since this would presumably require new legislation in the United States,to which the United States Administration have made it clear they cannot commitCongress. Moreover, under the new American formula there will be no provision,as there was in the 1962 formula, for consultation between the two governments on the possibility of decreasing the United Kingdom contribution (25 per cent)towards claims paid under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement in the eventof damage being widespread or exceptionally severe. This provision is of lesssignificance in view of the restriction of claims to death and personal injury. Inview of its omission and the restriction on claims, we should resist any UnitedStates request to restore the provision which was included in the 1962 formulator a maximum of $100 million for total claims for any one incident settled underthe Status Agreement.
recommendations.   We invite our colleagues to agree that:(a) we should inform the United States that we regard the Status agreement as applicable to claims arising from the Holy Loch arrangements and agree to settlement through diplomatic channels of claims not coveredby the Status Agreement;(b) we should seek United States agreement to the following wording:&quot;Except in cases covered by the NATO Status of ForcesAgreement claims following from a nuclear incident or accidentinvolving one of the submarines or their supporting craft will bedealt with through diplomatic channels in accordance withcustomary procedures for the settlement of international claims under generally accepted principles of law and equity. In thisconnection the United States Government, at international conferences where this subject has been discussed, has supported the principle of sole and absolute liability channelled exclusively to the operator of a nuclear reactor.&quot;and(c) an examination should be put in hand of the form of legislation now required to fulfil the undertaking to Parliament that principles similarto those embodied in the Nuclear Installations (Licensing and insurance) Act, 1959, shall apply to the United States polaris submarines in Holy Loch.R. A. B.P. T.28th January, 1964.AnnexHANSARD February 28, 1961, Col. 121POLARIS BASE, HOLY LOCH81. Mr. Manuel asked the Minister of Defence to what extent, during thecourse of his discussions with the representatives of the United States Government,he discussed the question of how British citizens living in the neighbourhood ofthe Polaris base in Holy Loch would be compensated in the event of radioactivecontamination.Mr. Watkinson: I am not prepared to disclose details of confidential discussions, but I can say that in the extremely unlikely event of a nuclear accident,claims would be dealt with, and compensation paid, in accordance with arrangements made under the Visiting Forces Act, 1952.In determining liability, it is Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ intention thatprinciples similar to those embodied in the NUCLEAR Installations (licensing and Insurance) Act, 1959, should be followed.
