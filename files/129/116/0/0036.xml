C. P. (64) 36COPY NO.5th February, 196-1.cabinet british GUIANA:  OIL imports memorandum, by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations andjEqr the ColoniesVfhen in 1940 the Rumanian Government expropriated United Kingdomrefineries without adequate compensation, the United Kingdom Governmentbanned the import of Rumanian oil.    There is also a general embargo on oil imports into Britain from the Soviet bloc.    (No formal ban has been placedon Russian oil supplies to Colonial territories but there is no record of anysuch supplies having been imported since 1959.)   Similarly, when theAnglo-Iranian properties were nationalised in 1951, the United KingdomGovernment instituted proceedings against Iran in the International Courtof Justice and, pending the outcome of the ca.se, refused to allow UnitedKingdom Nationals to purchase Persian oil.2.       In I960 the Castro Government took over United Kingdom and UnitedStates oil refineries in Cuba without compensation.    Towards the end oflast year the British Guiana Electricity Corporation placed a contract with a British Guiana firm named Gimpex, which is linked to Dr. Jagan&apos;political party, for the supply of oil from Cuba.   This oil is Russian crude oil, refined wholly or mainly in the expropriated refineries in Cuba.3.      In these circumstances I think v/e should instruct the Governor ofBritish Guiana to arrange for the importation of oil from Cuba to be prohibited after the first shipment which is already on the way.    It isprobable that if we take a firm line, Cuba will not risk sending further supplies.4.       The prohibition of oil from Cuba will involve a small increase of cost to British Guiana, of the order of 2j per cent on a contract worthabout  100, 000.5.      I ask the Cabinet to approve the action proposed.D.S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S. W. 1.5th February, 1964(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
