^pHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTcPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1964Copy No.   6 4CABINETPLOWDEN COMMITTEES REPORT ON THE REPRESENTATIONALSERVICES OVERSEASMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIntroductionThe Plowden Committee, whose report is unanimous, have recommended thatthe Representational Services overseas should be amalgamated into a single service to be known as Her Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Service; and that this Service shouldstaff the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office, which should remainseparate offices in Whitehall, and all Foreign Service, Commonwealth relations office and Trade Commission posts overseas. In the Committee&apos;s view theAdministrative Departments of the two offices in Whitehall should then be mergedto form a combined Administration. The report does not advise any significantchanges in the functions performed by the Representational Services but doesmake extensive recommendations for the improvement of their conditions ofservice. A summary of the Committee&apos;s conclusions is in paragraph 613 of thereport. The major recommendations are listed in Annex A.2. Legal advice has been received to the effect that a unified diplomatic service could be set up by Order in Council. Legislation would be needed forsuperannuation purposes; but it does not seem to be essential that it should be passed before a unified Diplomatic Service is established.3. The Committee&apos;s recommendations reflect a wide measure ofinterdepartmental agreement; my own recommendations in this paper are putforward in agreement with those of my colleagues who are directly concerned. Itseeks decisions on those issues raised in the report which, because of their importance, need to be referred to the Cabinet.A New Diplomatic service. The Committee conclude that the division of the world for representationalpurposes into Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries impedes thedevelopment and execution of a coherent foreign policy, and that the logic ofevents points towards the amalgamation of the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices. They recognise that the amalgamation of the two Offices mightbe misinterpreted as implying loss of interest in the Commonwealth partnership.They therefore hesitate to recommend this but instead put forward their proposal,as a reform urgently required, for the creation of a unified Diplomatic Service.5. There would be political difficulties in the amalgamation of the two Offices,but these would not apply to the formation of a unified Service as proposed. Thepractical advantages to be gained by this proposal would be many; and theestablishment of a common Administration serving the two Offices in Whitehalland posts overseas should lead to greater economy and efficiency.6.   I recommend that the Committee&apos;s proposal should be adopted.CP. (64) 343rd February, 19643883A
Conditions of Service ^7. One of the main purposes of the 1943 reforms which led to the establishmeSjof the Foreign Service was to ensure that members of the Service would be able to live on their emoluments and not need private incomes. Throughout the past decadeit has become increasingly difficult for members of the Service to do this. the plowden Committee were much impressed by the difficulties created for membersof the Overseas Services over the maintenance and education of their children.Although they have recommended no increase in the basic salaries of the overseas services, they have put forward proposals designed particularly to help officers with children, whose heavy educational commitments arise solely from their membership of an Overseas Service. The most important of these recommendationsis that for the payment of substantially higher boarding school allowances basedon the current cost of boarding school education. There is little doubt that no singleother measure could do more to free the members of the Overseas Services fromthe financial troubles incurred by reason of their employment overseas. Unlikemembers of the Home Civil Service and members of the Armed Services who oftenhave access to Service schools, members of the Overseas Services have not; and,because of the fact that they must often serve at small isolated posts where nolocal facilities are available, they must send their children to boarding school inthe United Kingdom.8. The Committee have also recommended that a new system of foreignallowances should be adopted for the Overseas Services which should be based onthe system of Foreign Service allowances paid to members of the Home CivilService serving abroad, with the addition of a Diplomatic Service allowance; andfor the more senior grades, provision to cover their representational commitments.9. The Committee&apos;s proposals have been carefully worked out to ensurethat they can be automatically adjusted to take account of changes in conditionsboth at home and abroad, and, once they have been put into effect, they shouldnot require major revision in the foreseeable future.10. Discussions between the Departments concerned have shown that, subjectto certain minor modifications; the Committee&apos;s recommendations on conditionsof service can be accepted; and I recommend that the Cabinet should approve their adoption.Premature Retirement from the Diplomatic Service11. The Committee recommend that the system of compulsory prematureretirement instituted by the 1943 Foreign Service Act should be applied to thenew Diplomatic Service as a whole; that it should be extended to cover officers ofthe present Foreign Service Grades A.9 and B.5 and their equivalents, and thatmodified arrangements should be applied to officers in Branches C, D and T(paragraphs 595 to 598 of the report).12. These recommendations are inter-departmentally agreed and will require legislation. I recommend that they should be adopted.Secondment between the Diplomatic Service and Departments of the Home CivilService13. In the past members of the Home Departments who have served abroadwith the Foreign Service have either been seconded for the purpose and in that event have received the same emoluments as their Foreign Service colleagues atthe post and been a charge to the Foreign Office Vote; or they have been attachedto the post and have received smaller allowances which have been a charge onthe Vote of their parent Department. The Plowden Committee have recommendedthat with the exception of members of the Armed Services and of the TreasuryDelegation at Washington where special circumstances apply, all government servants working in a Foreign or Commonwealth Service post abroad should infuture receive the same basic conditions of service at any given post. For thispurpose they have recommended that, with the exceptions mentioned above,members of the Home Civil Service should be seconded to the diplomatic service when serving abroad at Diplomatic Service posts. They would thenreceive the same emoluments as their Diplomatic Service colleagues of comparablegrade and responsibility, with the exception that they would not receive the
iplomatic Service allowance. Such seconded officers should be borne on theiplomatic Service Vote and be administered in the same way as their diplomatic service colleagues.Future of the Colonial Office14. It was agreed some time ago by the Ministers directly concerned that itwould be appropriate that in due course the Colonial Office should be amalgamatedwith the Commonwealth Relations Office, but proposals for the timing of theannouncement and the date of the merger were held up until the Plowden committee reported.15. It is now suggested that an announcement about the future of theColonial Office should be included in the statement of the Government^ decisions on the Plowden report. It is important to make an early announcement for thefollowing reasons:(a) The Colonial Office has shrunk in recent years, partly because of coloniesbecoming independent and partly through transfer of work to otherDepartments, notably the Department of Technical Co-operation. it now consists of less than 530 administrative, executive and clerical staff.It is bound to shrink further and has no long-term future as a separateDepartment.(b) The staff are anxious about their prospects. Although as members of theHome Civil Service they can be transferred to other Departments as andwhen opportunity occurs, they feel that, with no settled future for theOffice, they are at a great disadvantage compared with colleagues of equal seniority and merit who are in larger Departments which havea settled future. Promotion prospects in the Colonial Office for the senior staff are virtually non-existent.(c) The problems of staff management become very difficult in an Office whichis already small and is still contracting. For example, recruitment of junior administrative staff is not feasible; there are now only twoAssistant Principals.16. The date of the merger is a separate question. It is not suggested that the merger should take place until after the new Diplomatic Service has been broughtinto being; but it is suggested that the aim should be to effect it as soon as possible thereafter. It would hardly be practicable to do this in less than six months afterthe vesting date which on present, plans would mean merger on 1st July, 1965 and it would seem safer to announce that the merger will be effected in the latter half of 1965.17. The intervening period between the announcement and the carrying outof the merger would be used to plan for the disposal of the present staff of theColonial Office. They will fall into three groups:(a) Those willing and suitable to transfer to the Diplomatic Service.(b) Those who can be absorbed by other home Departments and can be spared.(c) Those not within (a) and (b) who will move to the commonwealth relations Office; endeavours to find new postings for them would continue after the merger, and in the meantime they would no doubt be employed on the the Colonial Office work which would have goneover to the Commonwealth Relations Office.Publication18. The existence and activity of the Plowden Committee have been reportedin the Press and questions about its work have been tabled in Parliament. It wouldnot be practicable to lay an Order without providing an opportunity for parliamentary debate (though there is no indication that the Opposition, who were represented on the Committee by Mr. Arthur Henderson, would demand a debate),and this would presumably have to be based on an official publication of some kind which would also be relevant to legislation. The best course of action thereforeseems to be for the Report, subject to some minor deletions which have been agreed3883
by the Committee, to be published as a White Paper. In that event, an announcementsof the Government^ policy on the Committee&apos;s recommendations could be issue&quot;/either(a) simultaneously; or(b) at a later date.The great advantage of course (a) would be that the Government would be seen tohave taken a clear decision. In view of the unanimity of the Committee&apos;s Reportthe adoption of their recommendations would be more readily understood. Theadoption of course (b) would enable the Government to test the reaction of thepublic and of the staffs to the White Paper. While this might have some advantages,it would open the Government to the criticism of lacking decision and the resultantdelay might be fatal to a favourable decision. I feel strongly that the balance ofadvantage lies with course (a).19. I therefore recommend that a simultaneous announcement should bemade in the terms of the attached draft, or a shorter version of it. Some interval willbe required to enable Commonwealth Governments and the Staff sides to beinformed in advance.R. A. B.Foreign Office, S.W. J,3rd February 1964.
REPRESENTATIONAL SERVICES OVERSEASDraft Statement by the Prime Minister on the Report of the committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Plowden, 1962-63The Government are deeply grateful to Lord Plowden and the members of his committee for their report and for the great amount of effort and thought whichthey put into it.The report shows that our need for efficient Overseas Representational services is likely to increase and that their tasks will grow wider in scope and become more complex and exacting. It contemplates that they will need a total operationalstaff of at least their present strength, plus a margin. The Committee believe that,while there will always be scope for changes in direction and emphasis withina scale of activity, this ought not in aggregate greatly to exceed the present scale.The report concludes that the division of the world for representationalpurposes into Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries impedes thedevelopment and execution of a coherent foreign policy and that the logic ofevents points towards the amalgamation of the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices. It recognises, however, the importance of continuing to demonstrate the special nature of the Commonwealth relationship. It thereforerecommends that the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices should remainseparate but that a unified overseas representational service to be known as&quot; H.M. Diplomatic Service&quot;, should be created. Her Majesty&apos;s government accept the views of the Plowden Committee and have decided that the unified service proposed should be formed on 1st January, 1965. The Queen has graciouslyagreed that it should be called Her Majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Service.One of the main purposes of the 1943 reforms was that the Foreign service should be able to seek recruits to the Administrative Branch from the widest possiblefield; and to this end its conditions of service were designed to ensure that its officers could live on their emoluments and had no need of a private income as was necessary in the pre-war era. Over the past decade, members of the foreign service and of the Commonwealth Service have found it increasingly difficult to live on their emoluments. The Plowden Committee have been much impressed by this, and particularly by the often serious financial difficulties occasioned tothose with several children who must, as a result of their parents&apos; peripateticcareer, be provided with boarding school education in the United Kingdom. TheirReport therefore recommends an improvement in the conditions of service of the overseas Services designed particularly to meet the needs of those with children.It also recommends a common system of foreign allowances to be provided for members of the Representational Overseas Services and members of the home civil Service when serving abroad. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted these recommendations subject to a few minor modifications and propose to put them into effect as soon as is practicable after 1st April, 1964.As membership of the Diplomatic Service will alter in important respects theconditions of service of Commonwealth Relations Office staff, the latter will beallowed a period in which they may opt for transfer to Home Civil service departments. Members of the Trade Commission Service will have the opportunityof opting to enter the Diplomatic Service.Though the future of the Colonial Office did not fall within the terms ofreference of the Plowden Committee, the Government have had it under review and have decided that as soon as possible after the new Diplomatic Service is brought into being which must be the first step the Colonial Office should be merged with the Commonwealth Relations Office. It will take some months aftervesting date to put into full effect the arrangements for the new Diplomatic Service,so that the merger of the Colonial Office with the Commonwealth Relations office could not take place until the latter half of 1965, although it will be effected on theearliest possible date in that period [and if practicable on 1st July, 1965]. In the intervening period, the staff problems involved in this decision will be worked outin detail, in consultation with the staff associations concerned.
This change in our arrangements for discharging our Commonwealth^!responsibilities continues the process of integration which my predecessor thJ8P&apos;Right Honourable Harold Macmillan began in July 1962 by the appointment ofmy Right Honourable Friend Mr. Duncan Sandys to fill the office of Secretary ofState for the Colonies in addition to that of Secretary of State for commonwealth relations.In the implementation of the decisions announced in this statement, the staffproblems involved will be worked out in detail in consultation with the staff associations concerned.Annex a major RECOMMENDATIONS(I) The Foreign, Commonwealth and Trade Commission Services should beunified to form a new &quot; Diplomatic Service &quot; (paragraphs 44, 45 and 51).(2) Secondment between the &quot; Diplomatic Service&quot; and the home departments, particularly the Board of Trade, should be encouraged(paragraph 613).(3) A combined Administration should be set up for the new diplomatic service under a Chief of Administration (paragraphs 63-65).(4) The establishment of common services, including in particular a unifiedsystem of communications (paragraphs 72-74, 152-167).(5) There should be a greater degree of unification in financial controlprocedures (paragraphs 78-83).(6) A new structure of gradings should be introduced and the new service should have latitude in varying certain staff gradings (paragraphs 91-104 and113-116).(7) The new Service will need to have about the same number of officers inoperational appointments as the three existing services now have but should have in addition a margin of manpower of 10 per cent to cover training, travel and leave and sick-leave (paragraphs 24, 30, 31, 86-90).(8) There should be a new procedure for ensuring a correct distribution of effort in the new Service between one post and another and one activity andanother (paragraphs 195-207).(9) The marriage bar on women in the Foreign Service should be modified in the new Diplomatic Service (paragraphs 117-123).(10) There should be more specialisation in languages, areas and functionswithin the career structure of the proposed unified service (paragraphs 180-194).(II) A Head of Chancery should be appointed at all overseas missions(paragraphs 216-218).(12) &quot; Policy Planning &quot; machinery should be improved both at departmentaland interdepartmental level (paragraphs 219-234).(13) Economic and commercial work must be regarded as a first charge onthe resources of the proposed Diplomatic Service. Proposals are made for agreater degree of selectivity in work priorities in this field and for greatercontinuity in staffing (paragraphs 235-237).(14) Information work should be closely related to specific policies andshould be undertaken by career members of the proposed Diplomatic Service(paragraphs 258-280).(15) Consular procedures should be modernised and steps taken to limit the pressure of work on consular staffs. In particular frivolous applications for repatriation at public expense should be discouraged (paragraphs 281-294).(16) The need for formal consular facilities in Commonwealth countries shouldbe accepted and there should be a closely knit and co-ordinated chain of command in all non-capital cities in the Commonwealth where there is British representation(paragraphs 295-300).(17) Efforts should be redoubled to widen the basis of recruitment to the newDiplomatic Service, especially from the Universities (paragraphs 352-383).
(18) More use should be made of the services of those from outside thepublic Service who have special knowledge or experience, particularly by meansof period of temporary service (paragraphs 384-388).(19) Civilian officers from home Departments in Whitehall who serve for periods at Missions overseas should be treated as seconded officers rather thanAttaches. This should help to knit Missions closely together and would help to rationalise foreign allowances as between members of the new Diplomatic Serviceand Home Civil Servants (paragraphs 389-397).(20) Officers from the Armed Forces should continue to serve on attachmentto overseas Missions but the procedure by which requirements for Service Attachesor Advisers are assessed should be improved (paragraphs 398-408).(21) More time, money and effort should be spent on training in the newDiplomatic Service. The emphasis should be on pre-post training (i.e., a period oftraining related to an officers needs in his next post) and to improved training in european languages. &quot; Hard &quot; language training should be extended to includelanguages used in the Commonwealth. Arrangements should be made to enable thenew Service to share the facilities of the Treasury&apos;s Centre for AdministrativeStudies in Regent&apos;s Park (paragraphs 421-436).(22) A new system of foreign allowances should be introduced (paragraphs458-480).(23) A new and improved system of boarding school allowances should beintroduced (paragraphs 495-508).(24) A second annual concessionary journey should be granted to enablechildren at school in this country to join their parents overseas during the schoolholidays (paragraphs 509-515).(25) There should be provision for travel to Britain at public expense oncompassionate grounds (paragraphs 518-519).(26) Compensation for service at certain especially difficult posts should takethe form of annual home leave (paragraphs 520-525).(27) An increase in expenditure on amenities is called for, particularly atdifficult posts (paragraphs 531-534).(28) Less restricted arrangements should be made governing the frequency atwhich climatic clothing allowances can be provided (paragraph 536).(29) Medical facilities should be improved and all members of an officer&apos;sfamily should be medically examined before appointment overseas (paragraphs537-544).(30) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should own a far higher proportion of the living and working accommodation occupied by members of the new diplomatic service overseas (paragraphs 548-549).(31) A swifter and more flexible service should be provided by the Ministryof Public Building and Works in the maintenance and furnishing of accommodationoverseas. The new Diplomatic Service should also improve the standard of its ownadministration (paragraphs 551-554).(32) The building to be provided in the future for the Foreign Office and commonwealth Relations Office should be fully adequate to its purpose(paragraphs 555-558).(33) The present system of Home Service Allowances should be overhauled(paragraphs 559-570).(34) The status and conditions of service of locally-engaged staff overseasshould be improved. In particular, a world-wide contributory superannuationscheme or schemes should be introduced for locally-engaged officers (paragraphs585-598)(35) The system of compulsory premature retirement now applied in theForeign Service should cover the new Diplomatic Service and should be extendedto cover the grades corresponding to A.9 and B.5 in the present Foreign Service.There should be modified arrangements for premature retirement for officers in grade B.6 and in the secretarial, messengerial and communications branches(paragraphs 591-598, 602-603).(36) An officer who retires voluntarily after 20 years&apos; service should&quot; be permitted on reaching the age of 60 to draw the pension earned up to the time ofhis retirement (paragraphs 599-600).
