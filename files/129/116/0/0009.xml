jHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY QF HER BRITANNIC MAJESWS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1964CP. (64) 9 Copy No, 5 4&amp;/z January, 1964CABINETCOMMONWEALTH policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional development and the President of the Board of TradeI thought that it might fee helpful to my colleagues&apos; discussion of the PrimeMinister^ memorandum on Commonwealth Policy (CP. (64) 6) if I were to circulatebefore the meeting some comments on those of the proposals canvassed in it which affect my departmental responsibility.2. I accept of course that it is desirable for every reason to &quot; take all possible steps to strengthen the links between the Governments and peoples of theCommonwealth &quot;. The problem in the economic field is to decide which steps arelikely to be fruitful and which would simply lead to frustration.3. The first point I would make is that The Queen&apos;s Speech made it clearthat the &quot; maintenance and development of commerce between commonwealth countries &quot; must find its place in our general effort to expand world trade. TheCommonwealth does not constitute a natural economic unit to-day. Moreover anyattempt to build up economic relations of an artificial kind would not be acceptable to the other member countries. They have realised that their own future prosperitydepends upon their ability to develop trade world wide. The United kingdom market of 50 million people can be expected to take only a small part of all the primary products, agricultur ah commodities, temperate and tropical, and industrialgoods that their expanding economies are able ;to export. Already four-fifths of thetrade of all other countries of the Commonwealth is outside the United Kingdomand two-thirds of it outside the Commonwealth altogether.4. This seems to me to be the,essential background against which any detailed proposals should be considered.5. On the proposals listed in the paper which concern me, I would offer thefollowing comments:Paragraph 2 (1). I do not believe that it would be wise to press upon areluctant Commonwealth a plan for setting up a Commonwealth economic development Council. The objections to this are well known, and the response to the initiative which we took at the meeting of Trade Ministers in May 1963,was entirely negative.In the much more limited initiative which the Chancellor took at theFinance Ministers&apos; Meeting in September 1963, we proposed no more thanstudies. Even so, this proposal had a mixed reception, ranging from someshow of interest on the part of India to undisguised hostility from Canada.A further message about this initiative has just been sent to commonwealth governments. In it, we have proposed that fuller annual studies should bemade, in an international economic context, of the prospects for trade of eachCommonwealth country. We shall be fortunate, in my view, if even this verymodest proposal wins sufficient acceptance; anything going beyond it wouldbe doomed to failure.3736
Paragraph 2(2). We have already had full exchanges of views in th .Commonwealth Economic Consultative Council on the United Nations TradWand Development Conference, and on the Kennedy Round at the meetingsof Trade Ministers last May and of Finance Ministers as recently as last september.These discussions revealed clearly the sharp divergencies of view anddifferences of interest among the various member countries. A further conference now could do nothing to narrow the gaps, but would certainlyserve to increase the pressure on us and on the older Commonwealth countries to do more in providing aid for the less developed members. It would alsoenable them to press us for trade advantages which we could not concedeexcept at the expense of our domestic industries (already, in the case of cotton textiles, suffering heavily from the inroads made by Commonwealth imports)or of our agriculture and our overseas commercial interests.The usual preliminary meetings between Commonwealth delegations willbe held immediately before the United Nations Conference and the kennedy round meetings of the GATT. I believe this is the arrangement which bestsuits our interest.Paragraphs 2 (3) and (3) (/). In my view, Export Councils are useful only where the climate for promoting export trade to a particular area is generallyfavourable. This is the chief reason for the great success during the past threeyears of the Export Council for Europe. It was formed at a time when UnitedKingdom interest in Europe was growing and when the economic situationboth in the E.E.C. and in the rest of Europe was one of great expansion.Interest was focused on it throughout the Brussels negotiations. It has alsobeen especially fortunate in its Chairman.The Western Hemisphere Export Council, formed three years ago as the successor to the Dollar Exports Council (which did very good work in theperiod soon after the war when our most pressing need was to increase our dollar earnings), has been a great disappointment. In the commonwealth countries which it covers (Canada and the Caribbean) our exports have fallenduring the past few years. It is now being wound up. It will be replaced bya tripartite and I believe more effective committee organisation.The Council on Middle East Trade, formed a year ago, has also been adisappointment and its future must now be reviewed.Our export trade with the countries of the Commonwealth is too diverseand presents too many different problems to be satisfactorily covered by oneexport council. I believe we shall get better results by other means directed tothe special situations of the individual member countries, where these aresusceptible to normal techniques of export promotion. In many commonwealth countries, including all the Asian members, except perhaps Malaysia and HongKong, trade is so hampered by currency shortages and import restrictions thatexport promotion of the normal kind is pointless. Any expansion of our tradein these countries depends more than anything else upon the amount of aid thatwe can afford to provide. New Zealand is also difficult because of her periodicalbalance of payments crises and the import restrictions that she has maintained,with varying degrees of severity since 1938.Australia, the most important of our Commonwealth markets, is also theone most susceptible to normal export promotion techniques. The Federationof Commonwealth Chambers of Commerce is setting up an Action Council underthe chairmanship of Lord Baillieu for the purpose of promoting our trade inAustralia. At the same time we are mounting a large programme of promotionalactivities, throughout 1964 culminating in the largest overseas exhibition thatwe have ever staged; this is to be held in Sydney next September.I believe that we are already doing all that we can, and that any furtherinitiatives would not produce useful results.6. I believe that this a realistic assessment. We still have preferences andother advantages in Commonwealth countries which, combined with effective means of export promotion, ought to lead to an increase in United Kingdom trade.Indeed, this I regard as one of our most urgent needs. We must however fit our
4k. trade with Commonwealth countries into the general pattern of our world tradeand not seek to develop arrangements with Commonwealth countries at theexpense of our general commercial interests. Nor must our businessmen thinkthat Commonwealth countries owe us a living simply because of theirCommonwealth membership. To some extent our trade with commonwealth countries has suffered simply because of our long-standing links which have ledindustry to take these markets more for granted than those of non-commonwealth countries in Europe and elsewhere. Our industry needs to develop its structureparticularly in marketing and selling, so that it can tackle all the opportunities for trade which present themselves in Commonwealth countries and elsewhere. Ageneral raising of the level of efficiency of industry will in my belief do more topromote our trade with the Commonwealth than any devices specifically directed to particular Commonwealth countries.E. H.Board of Trade, S.W. 1.7th January, 1964.
