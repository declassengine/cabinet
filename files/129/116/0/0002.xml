(THIS^JCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)CP. (64) %2nd January, 1964-Cyprus memorandum by the Prime minister have not called the Cabinet together over Christmas and theNew Year because the decisions which the Ministers most concerned had to take were related to whether or not we should accept a rolewhich we were pressed to undertake by the Greek and turkish governments and by the two communities in Cyprus.   We saw no alternative to doing so if widespread civil war was to be avertedwhich would inevitably have spread to Greece and Turkey.   I would now like all Ministers to have the complete story as we are approach-ing the point where we may have some very difficult decisions tomake.   The account of events is as follows.2.       The inter-communal fighting which broke out in Cyprus on21st December reached its height on Christmas Day.   On 24thDecember Her Majesty1^ Government, together with the Greek and turkish Governments, as the three Guaranteeing Powers, of the I960Agreements, issued a joint appeal to the Government of Cyprus andthe Greek and Turkish communities in the island to put an end to thedisorders.   The three Governments further offered their joint good offices to help to resolve the difficulties which had given rise to thepresent situation.   When it became clear that this appeal had failed,the three Guaranteeing Powers, on 25th December, informed theGovernment of Cyprus of their readiness to intervene, if invited todo so, to restore order, by means of a Joint Intervention Force,under British command, and composed of the forces of the UnitedKingdom, Greece and Turkey stationed in Cyprus.   This offer was accepted by the Cyprus Government and the Joint Intervention force was established under the command of Major General Young,Commander Cyprus District.3,      A Political Liaison Committee was later set up consisting ofrepresentatives of the three Guaranteeing Powers and of the two communities in the island.   Under the chairmanship of theCommonwealth Secretary, the Committee reached a satisfactory agreement on 30th December on a cease fire, the establishment ofa neutral zone, and arrangements for patrolling.   In practice, it hasnot proved possible to employ the Greek and Turkish contingents ofthe Joint Force for patrolling and this task has fallen to the Britishcomponent, consisting of the two infantry battalions, whose normaltask is the protection of our base areas (the Glosters and the3rd Green Jackets).   A battalion of Foresters was flown out on27th December to replace these troops in the bases, and in response-1-COPY NO.v v- V..CABINET
to an appeal by General Young, two further battalions and a brigade headquarters are being flown out this week.   We have resistedproposals by the Turks that they should send reinforcements since this would inevitably lead to a most dangerous situation to which theGreek Government might feel bound to react.4,       The Greek Government had hitherto remained steady and hasbeen taking a helpful attitude.   But the new caretaker government justformed has latterly been showing signs of undue anxiety over Turkishproposals for joint reinforcement and without any firm Ministerialguidance the Greek press is full of wild rumours.   Greek forces arein a state of readiness but no special movements of troops, ships or aircraft have been made.   The Turkish Government have been taking .the situation much more seriously and have made no secret of their intention to intervene militarily in the last resort to protect theircommunity in Cyprus!   and they have concentrated ships and troops at Iskenderun and Mersin.   They have, however, repeatedly assuredus that they have no intention of taking unilateral action so long asthe present tripartite arrangements succeed in maintaining order,and that their fleet movements are of an entirely precautionarynature.   Nevertheless, the Cyprus Government requested a meetingof the Security Council on the morning of 28th December to considerreports that a Turkish invasion fleet was approaching the island.The Turkish representative^ explanations appeared to satisfy theCouncil which adjourned without taking any action.5.       On 1st January Archbishop Makarios addressed a telegram tothe Heads of all States except the Guaranteeing Powers laying the blame for the present situation on the aggressive actions of theTurkish Government and announcing that, as a consequence, the cyprus Government had decided to abrogate the Treaties of Guaranteeand Alliance which gave Turkey the excuse to intervene.   After ameeting with the Commonwealth Secretary, he subsequently issued aclarification to the effect that his statement did not mean that the treaties had been abrogated but only that it was the CyprusGovernments &quot;desire to secure the termination of these Treaties by appropriate means&quot;.   We have urged the Turkish and GreekGovernments to take no unilateral action on this matter, and there isno present indication that either of them intend to do so, although anofficial Turkish Government statement has denounced Archbishop Makarios&apos;s expressed intention to abrogate the Treaties as&quot;completely illegal&quot;.6.      Archbishop Makarios&apos;s message is an obvious attempt to enlist international support for the Greek Cypriot case, and it is apparently his intention to follow this with an appeal to the united nations to declare by a vote of the General Assembly that the treaties of Guarantee and Alliance are invalid.   He is, therefore,holding back on the proposal for a conference of the three Guarantee-ing Powers and two communities in Cyprus (although the Turkishcommunity have expressed their agreement and other Greek Cypriotleaders seem disposed to agree);  and the Commonwealth secretary is at this moment pressing him for an answer.
7.       In order not to lose the initiative in the United Nations, andin the hope of avoiding wider United Nations involvement, we have proposed to the Turkish and Greek Governments that we should approach the Secretary-General of the United Nations to ask him toappoint a representative to act as a United Nations observer in Cyprus.Our idea is that the role of this observer would be (a) to observe theprogress of the peace-keeping operation and report on it to theSecretary-general (b) for this purpose to sit as a member of thePolitical Liaison Committee;  (c) to join in considering what measures could be taken to resolve the difficulties which had given rise to thepresent situation.   For this proposal to succeed, the full co-operationof the Cyprus Government would be essential.0.      Meanwhile, the patrols of British troops on the Island have succeeded so far in preventing a further outbreak of serious fight -ing, but arson and looting continue in parts of Nicosia, and thesituation remains highly explosive.9.       We have no intention of allowing ourselves to be manoeuvredinto supporting one side or the other.    If the Turks invade or if weare seriously prevented from fulfilling our policing role we have made it quite clear that we will retire into our base.   It will be clear,however, that this would be the signal for a Turkish invasion  and weshould only do this with the greatest reluctance.A. D. -H.10, Downing Street, S.W.12nd January, 1964-3-
