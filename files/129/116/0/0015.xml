Primed for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 15 Copy No.   6 613th January, 1964CABINETBRITISH POLICY AND THE BRUSSELS AGREEMENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at Cabinet on 9th January (CM. (64) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 2) the Ministerof Housing raised the question of British policy in the light of the agreement reached among the Six in Brussels last month; he was supported by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries. I undertook to circulate a short paper to mycolleagues on the situation.2. What the European Economic Community (E.E.C.) did was to take afurther step towards the completion of the Common Agricultural Policy and toagree upon a negotiating position for the Kennedy Round. I attach the main features of the agreement as an Annex.3. The decisions taken are not, of course, final and are in many respects farfrom clear. The agricultural regulations have to be worked out for final adoption by April and the proposals for the Kennedy Round represent a first basis for negotiation. It seems, however, unlikely that the Germans will be able to insistvery far upon the implementation of the liberal principles of Article 110 when it comes to actual negotiation.4. It is, of course, difficult at this stage to make any final judgment. Oneor two things are, however, reasonably clear. General de Gaulle has secured ashort-term political victory. He delivered an ultimatum to his partners and it was,in its essentials, met. On the other hand, the Germans did well for themselves,particularly their dairy farmers, and secured some concessions of principle which ought to be helpful in the Kennedy Round negotiations.5. The main significance of this package is, however, for the developmentof the Community. Its cohesion has been notably reinforced. The demonstrationthat agreement can be reached in spite of the divergence of national interests willstrengthen the Community&apos;s habit of survival and it will face its next test, wheneverit comes, with greater prospects of successfully surmounting it.6. For ourselves, the decisions now taken will do nothing to make a solutionof the problem of our relations with the Community easier. Our trade with theE.E.C. countries is in a flourishing state. Exports to those countries have risensteadily over the last few years by nearly 12 per cent per annum, and now account for one-fifth (20 per cent) of our total exports, against one-eighth (13 per cent)five years ago. Our total exports to the E.E.C. over the first eleven months of 1963amounted to  688 million as compared with  599 million for the comparableperiod in 1962. But we cannot remain content. The Community will continue to concentrate on its own affairs rather than its relations with us and the chances of achieving a wider European market are accordingly diminished. I am convincedthat our next aim must be to work for a successful outcome to the kennedy round with a linear cut in tariffs of 50 per cent as suggested and with theminimum disparities. This will not solve our problems but should be our immediateobjective, and the Germans, by securing agreement to a possible negotiating position by the Community may have made its prospects slightly better.7. We shall need to exchange ideas with the United States on all this,because their position on the Kennedy Round is crucial; as a first step we have in mind discussions between officials.3750IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
AnnexMAIN FEATURES OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITYAGREEMENT ON COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY ANDNEGOTIATING POSITION FOR KENNEDY ROUND(a) Agricultural RegulationsThe Council approved the main features of the regulations on rice, beef andveal and milk products and fats. This was the main requirement of the FrenchGovernment and they got their way, although some important concessions had to bemade, in particular arrangements to allow the Germans to continue to subsidisetheir dairy farmers, probably even after 1970, and to comply with their agreement to import Danish cattle. However, a clause is to be inserted in the regulations,linking them with Article 110 of the Treaty of Rome which states that the aim ofthe Community is to contribute to &quot; the progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade and the lowering of customs barriers &quot;.(b) Cereals prices the Commission had recommended the adoption in 1964-65 of a commoncereals price at a level roughly halfway between the French and German prices.This was left unsettled, but it was agreed that by 15th April a further Set of transitional prices should be fixed for the 1964-65 crop and there may be an attempt by the Commission to have the proposed final price taken as a target for 1966-67and thus in practice as a basis for the Kennedy Round negotiations.(c) Kennedy Round(i) agriculture the Commission^ proposals for the treatment of agriculture in the kennedy round were broadly approved. Under these the Community will be prepared toundertake not to increase its own support arrangements (i.e. its levies) if other agricultural exporting and importing countries will agree to bind their own supportsystems, whatever these may be, and if agreement is reached on price arrangements in international trade. The accompanying proposals for a series of internationalagricultural commodity agreements do not seem to have been considered.(ii) Industrial TariffsThe 50 per cent cut Was accepted by the Community &quot; as a working hypothesis &quot;but the right was reserved to reconsider this in the light of other problems,i.e., exceptions, disparities, agriculture, non-tariff and para-tariff barriers. On thequestion of tariff disparities (i.e. Cases in which one country Has a much higher tariffthan another for the same product) Ministers approved an elaborate and, at first sight, not very satisfactory procedure.2 CONFIDENTIAL ^f)8. We shall be able to go over the question from the German angle witnChancellor Erhard and Dr. Schroeder on 15th and 16th January. Then, with theSecretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development and theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries, I shall be discussing this whole complex of matters with Ministers of the other Western European Union countries at theW.E.U. meeting which is to be held in London on 23rd and 24th January. Ishould welcome any suggestions which my colleagues may wish to make on thesequestions. -R. A. BForeign Office, S.W. 1,10th January, 1964.
