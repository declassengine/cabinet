Printed for the Cabinet. February 1964CP. (64) 49 Copy No.  6 618th February, 1964CABINETDIPLOMATIC SERVICE ALLOWANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that at their meeting on 6th February (CM. (64)IOth Conclusions, Minute 9), when the Plowden Committee&apos;s Report on theRepresentational Services Overseas was considered, I was invited in consultationwith other Ministers concerned to arrange for further consideration to be givento the proposal that the Diplomatic Service Allowance should not be paid toseconded officers serving with Missions overseas.2. It has not been possible to reach agreement on this point and I now attach a paper prepared by officials setting out in more detail the arguments for and against.3. I would like to discuss orally with my colleagues ways and means of getting past this impasse while preserving the main objectives of the plowden committee^ recommendations. These represented an agreed compromise acceptedby both Government and Opposition members of the Committee.4. I would only add that it is in my view vital, for the efficiency and morale of the new Service, that the Committee&apos;s recommendations should be put intoforce as soon as possible, and with the least possible controversy.R. A. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,17th February, 1964.3955rTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
DIPLOMATIC SERVICE ALLOWANCENote by officials. The Cabinet remitted for further consideration the proposal thatDiplomatic Service Allowance should not be paid to seconded officers serving withmissions overseas.2. This note sets out the problem and the arguments for and against theproposal.3. There are at present two main systems of foreign allowance. The firstapplies to the Foreign Service, the Commonwealth Services, Overseas TradeCommissioners, and Attaches. But there are minor differences between thesedifferent Services; and the Attaches, unlike the Trade Commissioners and officersloaned to the Foreign Office to fill posts on their establishment, receive only90 per cent of the foreign allowance. The second system applies to all other civilservants from Home Departments, including subordinate staff in the offices ofCivil and Military Attaches.4. The Plowden Committee found these arrangements, which involve differentpayments to officers on the same kind of work, unsatisfactory and indefensible.They proposed, instead, a single system of allowances, to be built up in layers asfollows:(i) Local Allowance, including provision for maintenance of children at post.This would cover cost of living; and would remove the present anomalywhereby officers posted to the same foreign country may get differentcompensation for the extra cost of living there.(ii) Representational Supplement. This would be payable to officers whohave representational duties, irrespective of the Service to which theybelong.(iii) Entertainment Allowance. This would be payable to cover the cost ofmeals and drinks provided in the course of representational duties.(iv) Diplomatic Service Allowance. Unlike the other three, this would be payable only to officers with an overseas career, whilst they are serving abroad.It would have nothing to do with representational costs, whichwould be covered by allowances (ii) and (iii). It would be payable toall career members of the Diplomatic Service, not only to those withrepresentational responsibilities. Its purpose would not be to increaseliving standards en poste. It would be paid to compensate membersof the Diplomatic Service for having accepted the obligations of anomadic career, and to-provide them with an unallocated margin toenable them to meet the unforeseen contingencies resulting from sucha career. These extra expenses can be of a very wide variety. examples are the cost of breaking commitments when there is a posting to a newcountry at very short notice; the cost of coping with family illnessor troubles not strictly in the compassionate class; and the expense ofdealing with damage to a home in England by a series of tenants, andhaving to handle such matters through paid agents. The secondedofficer goes to a comparatively limited number of posts abroad, andwill not be sent if he has acute family difficulties. The career overseasofficer, who is liable to be posted to any part of the world, at short notice, and at any stage of his career, is likely over the total periodof his employment, and on his retirement, to incur additional expenditure in a variety of ways as a direct consequence of his conditionsof service.5. The Committee recommended that officers of Assistant Secretary rankseconded to the Diplomatic Service for the first time should have an enhancedoutfit allowance.6. The Committee recommended the abolition of the Trade CommissionerService as a separate entity. They hoped that most of its members would transfer to the new Diplomatic Service (in which case they would, of course, get the
^Diplomatic Service Allowance), but were also anxious that there should be&quot;Short-term secondments of officers from the Board of Trade. These officers would return to the Board of Trade at the end of their tour and would therefore, in theCommittee&apos;s view, be eligible for the allowances at (i)-(iii), but not for the diplomatic Service Allowance.7. The Board of Trade argued before the Committee that the diplomatic service Allowance should be payable to Board of Trade officers seconded to the diplomatic Service. The Committee rejected this argument (paragraph 575). Butthe Board of Trade maintain their case. Their main points are as follows:(i) There would be difficulty in persuading their officers, in sufficient numbers and quality, to accept overseas postings if on secondment they receivedless than colleagues of the same rank doing the same sort of job in thesame place. They had experience of this difficulty when at one timetheir officers secured less than Foreign Service officers when occupyingForeign Service posts abroad.(ii) Members of the Trade Commission Service at present receive substantially the same allowances as the members of the Foreign Service and theCommonwealth Service. The Plowden arrangement would thereforeinvolve a deterioration in present conditions.- (iii) The Diplomatic Service Allowance is to enable an officer to meetunforeseen contingencies while serving overseas. An officer secondedfrom the Board of Trade is liable to suffer such unforeseen contingencies.It is particularly expensive to go overseas for a tour of secondment inthe middle of a home-based career.(iv) The Board of Trade do not consider that the grant of the diplomatic service Allowance to seconded officers would have any materialinfluence on the decision of their officers whether to accept permanenttransfer or not.8. The Board of Trade accept that it may be difficult to distinguish between their officers and officers seconded from, for example, the Ministry of Labour orMinistry of Agriculture and that it might be right to give Diplomatic ServiceAllowance to all seconded officers. They do not consider that this forms a precedent for giving it to home civil servants who are serving abroad. They thinkthat the difference between someone who is serving in a representational capacity and someone who is not is fundamental and that the line can be held. In particular they feel that the make-up of the allowances for such a post must include aprovision for contingencies as it has in the past on approximately the scale of the diplomatic Service Allowance.9. The arguments which led the Committee to reject the Board of Tradecontention and on which the Treasury, the Foreign Office and the commonwealth relations Office support the Committee, are as follows:(i) A clear distinction can be drawn between the seconded officer whovolunteers for one, or even two, tours of duty abroad, and the officer who by the very nature of his contract is committed to a peripateticcareer.(ii) The argument of the Board of Trade is primarily addressed to the need to compensate their officers for the costs of taking a representationaljob. But the Diplomatic Service Allowance has nothing to do with this.If there is a case for giving more help here, it should be given by adjusting the allowances for initial equipment and representationalduties.(iii) The new system is designed to remedy the existing anomalies by providingallowances which are payable where the needs exist, and which do notdifferentiate between the services to which the officers incurring theexpenditure belong subject only to the addition of an allowancelimited to the overseas diplomatic career officer. The committee considered that there was a clear and defensible justification for payingthis allowance only to the overseas career officer; and that once it was paid to other individuals, there would be anomalies comparable withthose which the Committee have tried to remove for the following reasons.
The Board of Trade concede that, if the Diplomatic Service!Allowance is paid to their seconded officers, there is no logical reasonfor differentiating the seconded officer from other Departments. Butthere would be no logical reason to refuse to pay the allowance to theseconded officers&apos; clerks, some at least of whom will come from home departments; given the purpose of the allowance, the fact that they: ;. were not on representational work could not be used as a convincingreason for refusing to pay them the allowance.But, further, there would be no defensible reason for stopping atseconded officers. If the Diplomatic Service Allowance is to be paid toseconded officers on the grounds that, by being posted abroad, they become subject to unforeseen expenditure other than the expenditure incurred by representational duties, then this argument applies withequal force to all home civil servants posted abroad; and it is difficultto see what grounds there would be for refusing a similar allowance to the 8,000 civil servants from home departments who are serving abroad at any one time.Once Diplomatic Service Allowance is paid to people other thanthose with an overseas career, therefore, any stopping point would bearbitrary, difficult to define, and anomalous; but if there were nostopping point, and the allowance were granted to all civil servantsserving abroad, it would cease to be an allowance to cover the special needs of an officer with an overseas career who could point to the plowden Report as justifying the payment of such an allowance to him.(iv) If the seconded officer was in all respects treated as a full career officer,the incentive to transfer to the new Diplomatic Service would be diminished and. the objective of an integrated Diplomatic Service wouldbe prejudiced.10. Lord Plowden, Chairman of the Committee, and Lord Harcourt,Chairman of the sub-committee which considered conditions of service, both fely strongly that their recommendation on this issue was a cardinal feature of theirreport and an essential part of the new allowance system. There could be noquestion therefore of presenting the rejection of this recommendation as beingonly a minor modification of the report.
