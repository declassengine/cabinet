DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 30 Copy Nof    6229th January, 1964CABINETCHANNEL tunnel memorandum by the Minister of TransportMy colleagues agreed on 23rd January (CM. (64) 6th Conclusions, Item 7)that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I would consider the terms in whichthe Governmenfs attitude towards the Channel tunnel might most appropriately be announced.2. The Chancellor^ memorandum (CP. (64) 29) notes that I am unableto agree entirely with his views. It may help my colleagues if I also make myposition clear.3. I have no objection to the general terms of the announcement proposedby the Chancellor (except that it should refer specifically to a tunnel and not toa &quot; link &quot;). And I agree that if there is any possibility of a leak we should put outsomething to prevent speculation in the shares of the Channel Tunnel Company or at least speculation for which Her Majesty&apos;s Government might be blamed.4. My main point is that it would be intolerably discourteous and a clearbreach of faith with my French colleague (M. Jacquet) if Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment made any unilateral statement implying either a simple decision ofprinciple in favour of the tunnel or a predisposition for or against any particularmethod of finance without first giving the French a reasonable opportunity to comment on the terms of that statement.5. My agreement with M. Jacquet is that decisions of principle will be announced jointly. It has been honoured by the French side in spite of lengthydelays. It would be indefensible for us, after keeping the French waiting four months for a decision, to announce it without consulting them in advance.6. It is true that the terms of the Chancellor^ draft statement are little different in substance from a statement made by M. Jacquet to the National Assembly on30th October last. But the context is quite different. There is no doubt that theproposed statement will now be taken as a green light for the tunnel. Indeed, it isnot worth making a public statement unless it gives that impression.7. Moreover, the Chancellor^ proposal essentially involves a further statement whether or not in the form of non-attributable guidance to the Press-on the question of private equity. Here, we do not yet see eye to eye with the French.They certainly want to see private loan capital in on their side guaranteed by theGovernment. And they may want some form of equity too. Moreover we cannotensure that our own statement would not have some unwelcome effect on the shares of the separate French Concessionary Company which is their counterpartof the Channel Tunnel Company Ltd.8. In the circumstances, I think it is essential to let them comment in advance on what we propose to say. I do not believe that it should be impossible to keepour decision secret for long enough to enable a short draft text to be cleared withthe French by our Ambassador.3853
9. The.guidance to be given to the Press ought also to be cleared, at le.. /in outline, with the French. I suggest that this might be in these terms: &quot; It shouldnot be assumed that a Channel tunnel project would necessarily go ahead on thebasis put forward by the private promoters, who envisage, inter alia, a measureof private equity capital.&quot; This formula, though less explicit about the positionof private capital than what the Chancellor has in mind, would seem ample toensure that Her/,Majesty&apos;s Government could not be criticised for any speculativeshare dealing which may occur. And the French could not well object to it.E. M.Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1.29th January, 1964.
