secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT &apos;Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 3 Copy No. 666th January, 1964CABINETECONOMIC PROSPECTS, 1964Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee recently considered reports, annexed toE.P. (63) 40, on economic developments and the balance of payments prospectsto the end of 1964, together with a covering note by Sir William Armstrong.I attach the texts of these for the information of my colleagues. The work ofanalysis and forecasting has been done with the usual meticulous care, and it issummed up with clarity and conciseness in Sir William Armstrong^ covering note.2. The reports show that during 1963 developments have followed broadly the course which I suggested to my colleagues at the time of the Budget and before. Contrary to the views then expressed by many outside critics the stimuluswe have given to the economy has been enough to achieve vigorous expansion.It is clear that industry&apos;s estimates of spare capacity were greatly exaggerated,and that, as we have always maintained, labour supply, and particularly skilled labour, rather than machine capacity, is the limiting factor on output. As aresult pressure on incomes has emerged as the main problem for 1964, as wepredicted.3. The problems of 1964 set out in the reports come therefore as no surprise.They follow naturally upon the results of 1963. In a free economy like ours everyperiod of vigorous expansion based on taking up existing slack is bound tocall for some restraint as we approach capacity working. This is the position weshall reach in 1964. The problem is to achieve a transition from the current growth rate of nearly 6 per cent to the highest feasible long-term rate, which cannot on present indications exceed 4 per cent and might be less. In political terms our object must be to explain that this is not &quot; stop-and-go &quot; again but rather, inthe classic motoring analogy, settling down to a high cruising speed after a periodof acceleration.4. The official forecasts look for a steady rise in demand in 1964 of abouts 5\ per cent. The most vigorous element of growth is public investment. The mostunpredictable are stock building and private manufacturing investment, both ofwhich, we must recognise, may be affected one way or the other by politicalprospects over the coming months. But whatever the margin of error, it is clearthat pressure on resources by the second half of 1964 will have become severe.The balance of payments forecasts provide for no more than rough balance on current account together with an outflow of long-term capital, of about 300 million a figure which, though large, is by no means abnormally so by paststandards. The picture for world trade seems encouraging and therefore we shouldhave some confidence in the growth of our exports, which is fortified by the recenttrend of export orders. On the other hand it is difficult to be certain about the trend of imports. Allowance has been made for a considerable increase, which is inevitable and indeed desirable at a time of expansion, but this bill could rise stillfaster, either by more rapid stock building or by an increase in import prices.The extent to which an overall deficit of some  300 million would fall upon the reserves would of course depend upon the willingness of overseas holders of sterling to increase their holdings, and on the surplus of foreign exchange earnedby the main sterling area countries. But in any case a substantial fall in the reserves seems inevitable, concentrated, apart from any movement in confidence in the meantime, in the second half of 1964.5. I think we are justified as a Government in accepting the prospect ofa deficit on this scale, so long as we recognise clearly that it can be sustained only for a limited period, and we are consciously accepting it as part of the initial stages of building up production. If an adequate share of the increase in productiondoes not go into increased exports then we shall be faced with serious problems.
I believe that we have now adequate resources in cash and credit to deal withspeculation against sterling in the short-term.&apos; I also consider, and have saidpublic, that we should be entitled to draw on the International Monetary Fun^Fto finance a temporary deficit arising from substantial imports of materials for industrial stock building. But the underlying consideration in both cases is that ourown costs and prices should remain reasonably under control and that our productsshould remain and be seen to remain competitive.6.  The policies that we should follow in these circumstances appear to meto fall under three heads:(i) We should not stoke the boom up further by adding to our already verylarge commitments in the field of public expenditure, whether affectingconsumption or investment. The Chief Secretary is circulating a separate paper on this head.(ii) We must do all we can to make more rapid growth possible. As labour supply is the limiting factor, it is this field that needs particular attention. On economic grounds there are strong arguments forspeeding up the release of labour from the railways, coal-mining, andother declining industries. Anything that can be done to stimulatetraining and retraining and to break down barriers to the use of newskills will be immensely valuable. In general it seems clear that substantial increases in production can be obtained, quite apart fromthe installation of new machinery, by the acceptance of modernmethods. I suggest we might consider what contribution by way ofleadership the Government can make to this.(hi) It is essential to put all the emphasis we can on the maintenance of a competitive price structure. Here incomes policy comes in. I have nodoubt at all in my own mind that the key to success in this field liesfirst of all in getting some conscious personal acceptance ofresponsibility for incomes policy by all members of the national economic Development Council. I intend to put this vigorously beforethem at the next meeting on 8th January, and I will inform mycolleagues of the outcome. Other matters such as resale price maintenance and the possible use of unilateral tariff reductions alsoarise. The Economic Policy Committee will soon be considering thesematters with the advice of the Secretary of State for Industry, and i will arrange for the result of their consideration to be brought to theattention of my colleagues.Summary7. 1963 followed the course we predicted. In 1964 we are again facing theproblem of how to control a boom. It is much easier to start one than to controlit; and many may have an uncomfortable feeling that &quot; we have been herebefore &quot;. In a sense we have. But this time there are some new and encouragingfeatures. First, we are tackling the problems of incomes at an earlier stage in thecycle and, as a result of the efforts of the last few years, there is a much greaterpublic understanding of the facts of life. Secondly, we can look to much closerinternational co-operation in the defence of sterling, for which large resources areavailable. Thirdly, we have better control over the monetary situation; there is notthe same scope as there was in 1958-59 for the rapid expansion of consumercredit either through hire purchase or bank advances. Fourthly, we do not haveto face the special stimulus to imports which came in 1959 from the dismantlingof import controls. Finally, as a result of the investment over recent years, thereare presumably fewer bottlenecks in industrial capacity. On the other hand, therise in public expenditure now has a stronger and more sustained impetus andpublic opinion is even more averse than before to measures of restraint. This lastwe may turn to our advantage if we can show that our policies are necessary toenable expansion to continue without inflation.8. In paragraph 6 above I have indicated the areas of policy where I think we could take immediate action appropriate to the situation. But I also believethat at some time in the next few months we shall have to take more positivesteps to bring the boom under control; and one cannot expect that any such measures would in themselves be of a popular character.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,3rd January, 1964.
ft ANNEXN.I.F. REPORT AND BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROSPECTS report note by the Chairman of the Economic Steering (General) CommitteeI attach two reports, one on the economic outlook to the end of 1964 (basedon assessments completed in November), and the other on the prospects for thebalance of payments over the same period. They have been examined by theEconomic Steering Committee.2. We said in our report to the Economic Policy Committee last summer(E.A. (63) 136) that the picture for 1963 and 1964 was one of steady economic expansion and the emergence during 1964 of a tighter situation at home; and we expected that the balance of payments would be roughly in balance in 1963 butthat there would be some deterioration in 1964, though not a serious one. Weadvised Ministers that no special measures of a general character were called for,since the 1963 Budget provisions were only then beginning to take effect and the policies adopted to bring about the growth of the economy were developingsatisfactorily.3. The general picture that we now see is of demand at home continuing to expand rapidly at a somewhat faster pace than we previously expected, and at ahigher rate than our potential output at full employment, through 1964 (andprobably into 1965).4. In all the main elements of demand the expected trend is upwards. Therise in exports, which was the dominant feature in the first half of this year, isexpected to be less marked in 1964, and the rise in retail trade and consumers&apos;expenditure, which has occurred in the last few months as the Budget measurestook effect, is likely to slacken. But the pace will be taken up by investment andstock-building. Generally, though with variations from industry to industry,private investment is expected to be rising. There is recent evidence of this in private housing, and in manufacturing industry a rise of nearly 10 per cent by theend of 1964 is expected. But the main expansionary force is in civil public investment, where the Government have special responsibility: after allowing for delays in mounting the programmes of the recent White Paper and for somefrustration of demand because of the limited capacity of the building industry, arise is expected in the coming 12 months of 13 per cent. Since the level of stocksis still low in relation to the current level of output and since output itself is risingrelatively fast, there is likely to be an increasing rate of stock-building throughout1964 and this will be one of the main elements in the growth of demand.5. Employment incomes are expected to grow at an annual rate of about per cent. Part of this about If per cent corresponds to additional employment,including overtime, and the remainder represents the expected increase in earnings from higher wage rates or through wage drift.6. Taking account of all the factors mentioned in paragraph 5, the forecastimplies a steady rise in demand at an annual rate of about 5^ per cent. against this, the normal year-to-year rise in our potential output at full employment hasalmost certainly not reached 4 per cent; indeed it is probably between 3 and 3  percent. We expect the pressure of demand, therefore, to rise during next year andthe slack that now exists in the economy to be gradually absorbed. By the end of1964 there is likely to be an increasingly tight labour market and we can see noreason to suppose that the pressure of demand will cease to grow in 1965.7. The picture will differ widely from region to region and industry to industry. In the Northern Region and in Scotland the current rates ofunemployment are 4 - 5 and 4 - 2 per cent respectively; in London and the Midlandsthey are 1-2 per cent and 1 - 4 per cent. While there may be some slight closing ofthe gap between these extremes, it is likely that the shortage of labour will becomeacute in London and the South while there are still reserves of manpowerelsewhere. It will be some time before the full effect of the measures that have beentaken by the Government to assist industrial growth in the North is felt and itwould be unwise to count on a substantial change in the relative situation in thelabour market in the different regions in the course of 1964.
8. It would be on the balance of payments that strains would fall first. In1963 the surplus on current account is likely to be much bigger than in 1962 atjpshould be sufficient to cover the larger part of the probable net outflow OTrlong-term capital, which has also increased substantially. With an adversebalancing item the expected deficit of some  60 million on current and long-term capital account may mean an adverse balance of monetary movements exceeding 100 million. As is well known the figures are incomplete, and if all items were fully recorded the true position would be seen to be better than this.9. The balance of payments has already begun to weaken during this year,however, and a further deterioration is expected in 1964. A larger deficit is likelyon visible trade, and a slightly smaller surplus on invisibles, so that there will be only a slight surplus on current account to set against the net outflow of long-term capital. This is expected to increase markedly, perhaps to  300 million.* This mayproduce an adverse balance on current and long-term capital account of about 280 million; and in the circumstances foreseen a substantial fall in the reservesis likely, concentrated in the second half of the year.10. Much in the forecast is uncertain. On the one hand, the quantities weimport and the prices we pay may well prove to be higher than has been allowed for; food prices may not fall later next year, particularly if there are further cropfailures; and the assumption of unchanged prices for raw materials may also turnout to be optimistic. On the other hand, later information about the course of world trade in manufactures this year suggests that the rise next year may be slightly greater than was expected when the forecast of our own exports was prepared. Then again the forecast of the capital account, which is always aspeculative one, has had to assume that interest rates will remain unchanged; andthe view has been taken that in an election year opinion abroad will not be favourable to certain kinds of investment in the United Kingdom. It is difficult toweigh up these uncertainties, but we do not think that the forecast as a wholeoverestimates the deterioration which is likely to take place. It certainly envisagesa less serious deterioration of the balance of payments than accompanied the lastupswing of the economy.11. In considering how this problem is to be dealt with it is relevant to askhow far the deterioration of the balance of payments next year (and quite probably also in 1965) can be attributed to factors which would not be present over a longerrun of years. The rise in demand and in stock-building would be exceptionallyrapid. Were it not an election year somewhat larger overseas investment in thiscountry would be likely, and in more normal circumstances movements ofinternational short-term capital would not be expected to be adding to our difficulties. Much of the deterioration foreseen is associated with these factors,though that does not mean that the balance of payments would right itselfautomatically once they pass. Excessive increases in incomes are again threateningour future competitive position.12. We want to draw the attention of Ministers to the change in the economic climate which is taking place. There is no longer any fear of under-employment inthe country as a whole. The danger is rather of excessive pressure of demand, with over-employment in the Midlands and the South. Incomes policy is increasinglythreatened, and costs and prices may well be rising damagingly before the end of next year. All these developments would tend to react adversely on the balanceof payments and are indeed among the main reasons for the deteriorationexpected.W. ARMSTRONG.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th December, 1963.* The large oil investment mentioned at the foot of page 13 of B.P. (63) 17 (Final) has beendecided upon since the Balance of Payments Prospects Report was completed. This raises the forecast of the net outflow of long-term capital in 1964 from  240 million to about  300 million, but some 20 million of this will not fall on the reserves.SECRET
mINTRODUCTIONThis report reviews the economic outlook to the end of 1964. The forecast isbased on the conventional assumption that current credit and fiscal policies are maintained throughout the period.2. The report is divided into four sections. Section A is a brief summaryof recent developments. Section B is a summary of the forecast for demand and activity. Section C discusses the implications of this forecast for the developmentof the pressure of demand and unemployment. Section D attempts a comment onthe forecast and discusses some of the uncertainties in it.A. Recent developments3. It is clear that, as envisaged in our last report which was completed earlyin July, there has been a rapid recovery since the early months of this year. Therehas been a renewed rise in exports: in the third quarter they were, in volume andseasonally adjusted, 3- - per cent more than in the first quarter and 5 per cent morethan a year earlier. At home, consumer spending has risen. Sales of cars havebeen maintained at the very high rate reached in the second quarter and retailsales have increased since the middle of the year, when the tax reliefs of theBudget began to affect pay packets: in the third quarter the volume of retail saleswas 3i per cent higher than a year earlier. Public expenditure is on a rising trend,particularly on capital account. The fall in industrial investment has at leastslackened and private housing starts are currently at very high rate. In total, fixed investment is probably now rising, after nearly two years&apos; stability, with the risein public investment no longer being offset by a fall in the private sector. Thereis no sign yet, however, that any marked upturn in stock building has begun.4. Industry seems confident that a strong expansion is continuing. Theresults of the last two industrial trends enquiries held by the Federation of BritishIndustries in June and October are strikingly reminiscent of the correspondingenquiries held in 1959. Their results, the results of official surveys in June-July ofbusiness investment intentions and other forward looking indicators all suggestthat some increase in industrial investment is imminent.5. The recovery in demand and expectations has been reflected in the risein industrial production and in new orders. In the three months June-Augustindustrial production was nearly 3 per cent higher than in the previous three months and more than 3 per cent higher than in the third quarter of 1962. In manufacturing industry alone the rise has been faster. Order books generally have beenlengthening.6. Unemployment has continued to fall back rapidly: by about 8,000 a month(wholly unemployed in Great Britain excluding school-leavers, and seasonallyadjusted) in the three months July-October, and by mid-October it was a littlelower than a year earlier. The number of outstanding job vacancies registered for adults, which had not changed much for about a year, has risen sharply since August and in October was distinctly higher than a year ago, though the totalremains low roughly one-third the size of the number unemployed.7. These labour market indicators are the best quick guide we have to the degree of pressure of demand. They suggest that the rise in demand and activitythat has taken place so far has been sufficient to take up the extra margin of slackthat began to develop during the second half of 1962; but there is a good deal still to be absorbed.B. The outlook for demand and activity8. In our forecast the gross domestic product rises by a full 8^ per cent in the forecast period as a whole that is, between the second quarter of 1963 and thefourth quarter of 1964. This is equivalent to an annual rate of close on 51 per cent.We think that the increase in the current half year between the second and fourthquarters of 1963 may be a little faster than this, helped by the special factor of thecoming into effect of the Budget concessions on personal taxation. But we envisageoutput rising pretty steadily at an annual rate of some 5\ per cent throughout 1964.
9.   The main ingredients of the forecast of demand are as follows.(a) Exports of goods in volume rise at an annual rate of about 2\ per cent^jThis is close to the rate of increase on average for most of the last decade. Exports of services rise only a little.(b) Current expenditure on goods and services by central and local governmentrises in volume at an annual rate of about 4 per cent throughout the forecast period.(c) Total fixed investment rises at an annual rate of nearly 9 per cent duringthe forecast period as a whole. The increase would be larger than thisbut for the delays we think there will be in practice in stepping uppublic investment to the levels envisaged in the new civil public investment White Paper, and also because we expect demand for construction work to be effectively limited by the capacity of thebuilding industry. The major item in the increase is civil public investment, which rises strongly throughout the period and by up to13 per cent between the fourth quarters of 1963 and 1964. We expect the fall in manufacturing investment in total to end during the currenthalf year. Investment by the steel industry is forecast to level out in1964 and we expect investment by other industries, taken together, to berising fairly briskly. Total manufacturing investment rises by 7-8 per cent between the fourth quarters of 1963 and 1964. Investment in new ships is likely to be a little higher next year as a result of orders placed in response to the new credit scheme and we expect other private investment, including housing, to be rising moderately.id) The prospects for incomes, prices and saving start from the index ofhourly wage rates, which is assumed to rise at an annual rate of 4^ percent from the third quarter of 1963 onwards, or rather more than therecent rate. (Since not all wage earners get an increase every twelvemonththis is equivalent to a rather larger average size of settlements.) average earnings rise considerably faster than wage rates: we expect moreovertime to be worked and we are expecting employment to rise rapidly,by just under 2\ per cent between the second quarter of 1963 and thefourth quarter of 1964. Other incomes, apart from social security benefits(whose present rates are assumed to be maintained) also reflect the expected rapid rise in activity. Consumer prices are expected to rise atan annual rate of about 2 per cent. Real personal disposable incomerises by 4f per cent between the fourth quarters of 1963 and 1964,following an even faster rate of increase in the current half year whenthe tax concessions become effective. We expect a renewed rise in theproportion of income saved. This tends to happen most markedly whenreal incomes are rising strongly. We do not expect much furtheracceleration in the rise in consumer borrowing.(e) Consumers&apos; expenditure rises rapidly in the current half year, helped bythe Budget concessions. We have put the increase between the second and fourth quarters of 1963 at an annual rate of over 5 per cent.Between the fourth quarters of 1963 and 1964 the increase is not quiteso rapid about 4 per cent..(/) A substantial rise in the rate of stock building, induced by the general risein activity, is included in the forecast. Both the timing and extent ofthe change should be regarded as very uncertain. At the period fromwhich the forecast starts the rate of investment in stocks was low well below the average rate over a period of years. What the forecastallows for is a rise to a terminal rate of  140 million (equivalent to 560 million per annum), which would be well above any long-termaverage over a run of years. The forecast v/ould involve a fall in the ratio of stocks to turnover continuing during most of the forecastperiod; this is not unusual in the first part of the upswing of the tradecycle. The stock/turnover ratio is still relatively low at the end ofthe forecast period. The increase in the rate of stock building betweenthe second quarter of 1963 (when it appears to have been negligible)and the fourth quarter of 1964 accounts for an eighth or more of therise in production during the period (1 per cent on G.D.P.).
sjp. The outlook for the pressure of demand and unemployment10. A rise in output on the scale forecast would certainly exceed the simultaneous growth of productive capacity (potential production at full employment) and so lead to a rising pressure of demand on resources and fallingunemployment.11. We have no precise measures of the current or prospective growth of capacity. In our recent reports we have guessed it to be 3-3-1 per cent per annum and we have worked on this assumption in this report also. This rate is rather more than the highest estimate than can be made for, say, the last decade as awhole and implies that there has been some acceleration in the last few years,perhaps associated with the large amount of industrial investment that has beencarried out since 1959. Looking ahead there seem likely to be fewer industrialbottlenecks than have impeded progress on some occasions in the past. There isample capacity now in the steel industry, and generally speaking, the only major problem of plant capacity seems likely to be in the supply of electricity. This shouldbe a factor increasing the potential growth of production. Against this, the pace of the recent tightening of the labour market argues against there having been any marked fresh acceleration of the growth of capacity: demand for labour does not seem to have risen at all slowly in relation to production. Moreover the latest estimates show that the demographic increase in the labour force that is in prospectis rather less than in most recent years.12. The rise in activity so far this year has taken up some of the slack inthe economy but its productive resources are still under-employed. There is noobjectively &quot; right &quot; pressure of demand to aim at, but our experience is, we think,fairly summarised in the judgment that a level corresponding to unemployed of2 per cent or more is too low, while a level corresponding to unemployment ofabout 1-5 per cent or less is likely to have undesirable consequences for costs,prices and the balance of payments. Measured against the centre of this range we estimate (making the best estimate we can of the relation between utilisation of capacity and unemployment) that in the third quarter of this year the slack was ofthe order of 2-2^ per cent. Our forecast of the rise in production from the thirdquarter onwards implies that capacity utilisation would increase at the rate ofabout one half per cent a quarter. The present slack would thus be taken up entirely in four or five quarters, that is to say by some time late in 1964. The economy would then be fully loaded and any further increase in the pressure of demand would bring it into the range which in the past has been found to have difficulties and dangers.13. This is the main conclusion. Estimating its implication for the level ofunemployment involves the difficulty that there is a time lag between changes incapacity utilisation and changes in unemployment but that time lag is not exactlyknown and almost certainly not constant. A change in capacity utilisation of the size suggested in itself is &quot; worth &quot; a fall of the order of 100,000 in unemploymenton the basis of the normal.relationship, i.e., roughly 0-4 points of the unemploymentpercentage which in mid-October was equivalent on a seasonally adjusted basis toabout 2 -1 per cent for Great Britain as a whole. Whether unemployment would fall as much as this within the time-span of the forecast period may be doubtful;it would depend both on the development of capacity utilisation and on thedevelopment of the time lag. But it is clear that the production forecast impliesfalling unemployment throughout the forecast period.D. Comment on the forecast14. We are now forecasting a higher level of demand in 1964 than we forecast in our last (July) report; and the rise in activity during 1964 is more sustained thanit was then. We now expect the gross domestic product to be rising at an annual rate of over 5 per cent all through the year where in our July report we thought there might be some slowing down in the rate later in the year to little over 4 percent. Faster increases are now allowed for in exports, consumer spending andstockbuilding. The view that expansion will continue, at any rate for some time,seems now to be quite general outside Whitehall and to have become much morefirmly established in the last few weeks. How far commentators are looking aheadis not clear: as yet, it may not be very far, and it is probably an important feature of our review that in trying to look more than a year ahead we see a sustained risein all sectors of demand.
15. The uncertainties inherent in the outlook for demand can perhaps bj&amp;fcdivided into two kinds. First there are two questions that stand rather on their owriWAre we right to allow in the forecast for a rather slower growth of exports than there.has been in the past year? And how quickly in fact will all the many authorities concerned succeed in stepping up public investment within the very big totals nowauthorised? (On this latter we can hope before our next report in February to have some better indication of how things are progressing from the outturn for the thirdcalendar quarter.)16. The other major uncertainties stem in one way or another from the general question: have we made a good judgment of the scale and pace of business and consumer reactions to the new upswing of the trade cycle that we see now to bedeveloping? Any rapid rise in activity is liable to generate so-called acceleratoreffects on business investment both in fixed plant and in stocks, facilitated by increasing company liquidity, and they are extremely hard to quantify in advance.Have we allowed enough for them within the forecast period for it is a feature of the forecast that it implies a high rate of stock building and further increases in industrial investment in 1965? For fixed investment we have the benefit of bothofficial and unofficial surveys of intentions which help to narrow the range and theresults of the next official enquiries which will be held late this year will give fresheyidence for the February report. But a forecast for stock building must always bevery uncertain. In the personal sector, how will consumers choose to divide the rapidrise in their real incomes the first substantial sustained increase since early 1961 between spending and saving; and how much will they increase their borrowing?In considering these questions we have paid a good deal of attention to the courseof developments in the 18 months between the beginning of 1959 and the middleof 1960 when activity rose much as we are now envisaging for the six quarters ofour whole forecast period: but even with this fairly recent precedent we are left with a fairly wide margin of uncertainty.17. The basis of our forecast for the development of the pressure of demand and unemployment was indicated in Section C above. The behaviour ofunemployment and the other labour market indicators in the last few months haverather allayed the doubts we had last winter about the possibility of using past experience as a guide to the underlying growth of productivity and the amount ofslack in the economy. But the fact remains that we cannot know precisely at whatpace capacity is growing and if we have misjudged the prospective growth of productivity this will falsify pro tanto our forecasts for employment and unemployment.18. This uncertainty, however, does not much affect the general picture that,if our demand forecast is right, pressure on resources will rise strongly and this raises the whole question of what effect easier profits and a tightening labour marketwill have on the pace of wage increases. In our forecast we have assumed only a moderate acceleration of the rise in wage rates in the forecast period. This is of some importance within the forecast because, even after allowing for the feedback throughprices, a faster rise in many wages would add something to real demand beyond what we have forecast. But it has of course a much wider importance than this.19. It was the conclusion of the July report that the risks for the future lay onthe side of having too much demand rather than too little. Such an assessment ofrisks involves asking the question: would it be more dangerous if the rise in demandturned out (as it easily could) to be greater than the forecast by a certain amount,or if it turned out (as it just as easily could) to be less by that amount? It is evenmore plainly true of the present forecast that the answer to the question is that the risks are on the side of having too big a rise in demand. Output could probably risea good deal less quickly than the forecast suggests and still ensure a continuing fallin unemployment. But a substantially faster rise in output than is now forecast would almost certainly produce within the period a dangerously heavy load of demand onour productive resources.
REPORT OF NOVEMBER 1963 ON BALANCE OF PAYMENTSPROSPECTS TO END-1964I.-summary the balance of payments in 1963The improvement in the current account of the balance of payments which took place in 1962 has been carried further in 1963. Imports and exports have been rising strongly, and, although the rise in imports has recently accelerated, thebalance of visible trade will probably show no more than a small deficit over theyear as a whole. The surplus on invisible transactions is likely to be somewhatlarger than last year. The surplus on current account, though declining in the latter part of the year (even after allowing for seasonally), seems likely to reach about 140 million in 1963 compared with about  70 million in 1962.2. The net outflow on long-term capital account increased sharply in the first half of 1963 and over the year as a whole is expected to amount to about 200 million, thus approximating to the rate common before 1961. Official lendingwould contribute a little to the increase of  110 million compared with 1962, butthe bulk of it arises on private investment, including a substantial fall in inwardportfolio investment. A deficit of  60 million is expected on the balance of current and long-term capital transactions compared with a deficit of about  20 million in 1962.3. The balancing item was negative in the first half of the year, in contrast to its normally high positive value at that time, and may well be negative by 50 million or more over the year. Thus the balance of monetary movements islikely to be unfavourable by an amount exceeding  100 million.Prospects for 19644. Imports will increase substantially between 1963 and 1964, and exports arenot expected to keep pace. The balance of visible trade may deteriorate by some 110 million. With no change on invisibles account, the surplus on current accountmay virtually disappear next year.

accompanied by some increase in the net outflow of long-term capital, perhaps tflfc* 240 million. Although no change in the net total of private investment abroad ifPenvisaged, official lending and loan repayments will be larger. Taking the current account and the long-term capital accounts together, an identified deficit of some 220 million is forecast. This seems unlikely to be alleviated by the balancing item,which could indeed be negative.II.-COMMENTARY ON THE FORECAST5. In the report we made last summer we foresaw some weakening of thebalance of payments in 1964, though not a serious one. The present forecastpresents a more unfavourable picture. The prospect has changed in a number of ways. The outlook for exports is better, but the faster expansion of the UnitedKingdom economy now expected and the less favourable development of pricesled to bigger imports and a slightly larger trade deficit than we previously envisaged. Prospects also seem to have altered for the worse as regards the outflow of long-term capital and the balancing item.6. As usual, our forecast is subject to a wide margin of error and shouldnot be regarded as providing more than a broad indication of the likely outcome.At certain points the uncertainties are especially great and these deserve specificmention.7. The import bill is bound to increase substantially with an upswing in the economy, and imports will almost certainly rise faster than output next yearbecause of the associated increase in stock building. But the amount and timing ofthis effect is very uncertain. Also our assumption about import prices may beoptimistic: it envisages stability from now on in raw material prices as a whole and a slight fall in food prices later next year, largely reflecting an expected drop in the world price of sugar. Our view on raw material prices could be challengedin the light of a number of specific increases recently and of the relatively buoyantprospect for world industrial production. It rests on experience over a decadeor so, in which the trend of prices has been slowly downward while worldindustrial production has been increasing on average nearly as fast as our forecastassumes next year. But it may be that the supply situation is becoming tighterand that raw material prices will in fact rise.8. The export forecast envisages a rise in the value of exports in 1963 and1964 well above the average increase over the last decade. It implies that in contrast to experience over most of that period there will not be any marked decline in our share of world exports of manufactures. To that extent it is a bold forecast. Onthe ether hand, we have not taken quite such a buoyant view of the world economy as would be implied by some of the national forecasts recently provided by member countries of O.E.C.D. To that extent our forecast would be characterised ascautious.9. Furthermore we have assumed that, with the balance of paymentsdeteriorating and the inevitable uncertainties of an election year, the state ofopinion abroad is not likely to favour the purchase of United Kingdom securitiesby overseas residents or their continuing to hold short-term funds here of a kind which at present escape our statistics. This partly explains the low inflow ofportfolio investment we expect. Together with the assumption of unchanged ratesof interest, it also underlies our expectation that the balancing item is unlikely tobe positive and may be negative.10. This is a short-term forecast, and we must try to put it in longerperspective. We can approach this in several ways.11. One is to look back at the past. A rapid upsurge of the domestic economy,with increasing pressure of demand on resources, has normally been accompaniedby deterioration in the current account of the balance of payments. Taking onesuch period, G.D.P. increased by about 9\ per cent on an output basis (less on an expenditure basis) between the second half of 1958 and the first half of 1960 andthe visible balance deteriorated by  145 million (seasonally adjusted). From the
Jirst half of 1963 to the second half of 1964, G.D.P. is expected to rise by aboutp^O per cent,C) but the visible balance would deteriorate, according to our forecast,by only about  90 million on a half-yearly basis.12. Our forecast means that we believe there are good grounds for expectinga less serious worsening in the present up-phase. Many such considerations aresubsumed in our forecast. Among these is the different pattern of demand envisagedthis time, with somewhat less emphasis on private investment and exports (bothof which have a relatively high import content); also there will not be theliberalisation of imports from quota restrictions, such as occurred in 1958 and 1959.13. Another approach is to consider how far the deterioration we expectcan be attributed to factors expected to prevail in the coming period which wouldnot obtain over a longer run of years. L964 is expected to be a year forming partof a cyclical recovery when the rise in total demand (some 6 per cent over 1963)and the associated rise in stock building would be bigger than the annual increases to be expected over the longer run. Consequently, the forecast increase in imports is well above average and the associated rise in expenditure abroad on invisibleaccount offsets in our forecast the otherwise moderately improving tendency ofthe invisible balance. 1964 is also likely to be a year of adverse confidence in sterling, and on our assumption of no change in United Kingdom rates, interestrate differentials may remain relatively unattractive. Consequently the inflow ofportfolio capital is expected to be depressed and no help from the balancing itemis looked for. Assuming no changes in policy, it is probable that such adversefactors would also persist, though not necessarily to the same extent, in 1965.These points cannot be quantified in any precise way but much of the deteriorationcan probably be attributed to factors which would not persist over a longer run of years.14. Seen in perspective, then, the forecast is a bold one in that the balance ofpayments is expected to respond less unfavourably in the period ahead than it did at the time of the last upswing in the economy. Much of the deteriorationforecast can be attributed to factors which should not persist over a longer run of years. But the prospect is one of a substantial deficit in 1964, quite probablycontinuing into 1965.Ill-ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDExternal situation15. The balance of payments forecast is founded on a view about thedevelopment of economic activity in the main industrialised countries. The chiefelements in this view are an expanding United States economy and a growth of output in Western Europe continuing at about the same pace in 1964 as in 1963,though somewhat slower than in most recent years; measures to arrest priceinflation would be holding back the rate of expansion, e.g., in France and Italy.16. Trade between industrial countries seems likely to expand less rapidly in the course of 1964 than during recent years. World industrial production should, however, be proceeding fast enough to avert a fall in raw material pricesfrom their recent level and food prices are expected to be slightly higher in thefirst half of next year because of major crop failures in some countries. In general,exports from the primary producing countries should do well. Exports of manufactures to them, which were slack in 1961 and 1962, have recently been rising, and this increase should continue.Internal situation17. There has been a rapid recovery in activity since the early months of1963, and the gross domestic product is forecast to rise at an annual rate of over5l2 per cent from the second quarter of 1963 to the fourth quarter of 1964. Theyear-to-year change in gross domestic product would be an increase of rather(x) Making no allowance for the abnormal weather in the early part of this year.
more than 6 per cent between 1963 and 1964, output in the first quarter of thi^year having been depressed by severe weather. All the main sectors of demaiwp?are forecast to be rising, with a strong growth in fixed investment, particularly inthe public sector, and in stocks. Total stock building is put at over  400 million in 1964 compared with about  100 million in 1963. The pressure of demand willbe rising over the period, and by the last quarter of next year it may be approaching the limit to which it is safe to go.IV-FORECASTS IN DETAILImports18. Total imports valued f.o.b. in the balance of payments are forecast torise by  240 million (6 per cent) between 1962 and 1963, and by a further  340million (8 per cent) in 1964. The increase in volume between 1963 and 1964 wouldbe about 8 per cent.19. With a larger home output in 1962 and more normal spring weather in1963, the volume of imports of food and feedingstuffs has fallen back this year from the high level in 1962. The value of total imports of food, drink and tobacco(c.i.f.) may be some  110 million more than last year, mainly on account of the exceptionally high world prices for sugar.f) The forecast for 1964 is for a furtherrise of  55 million. Sugar apart, the increases would be  5 million in 1963 and 25 million in 1964.20. The forecasts take account of the sharp rise in cereal prices caused bythe Russian purchases of wheat from Canada and Australia. It is too early to assess the effect of the arrangements now under negotiation with our suppliers ofcereals and meat to secure greater stability in these markets. These arrangements could make a further addition to the import bill as forecast, but probably onlya small one.21. Imports of industrial materials have risen rapidly in recent months. Asmanufacturing output grows and stock building rises with it, a further big increasein imports of this kind is likely; the volume may be about 14 per cent higher in1964 than in 1963. Although there have recently been some signs of buoyancy ithas been assumed that prices do not change on average, and the value of imports is forecast to rise by  260 million next year.22. The rise in the tonnage of oil imports between 1963 and 1964 is expectedto be about 8 per cent, but the increase in value will be slightly less as theproportion of crude increases. The c.i.f. value of fuel imports would rise by 40 million in 1963 and  40 million in 1964..23. Imports of finished manufactures have risen strongly in recent years andthis is expected to continue. They are forecast to increase by  50 million (8 percent) this year and by  85 million (13 per cent) in 1964. Among consumer goodsthere has been a recovery, aided by reductions in purchase tax and the tariff, in imports of cars from the low levels of 1961 and 1962. Imports of clothing also have increased rapidly. With rising consumer demand imports of consumer goodsin total in 1963 may be 19 per cent more than in 1962, and a similar increase is forecast in 1964. With declining investment in plant and machinery and lowerarrivals of ships this year than last imports of capital goods in 1963 are not likelyto be much higher than in 1962. But private investment is likely to be rising later in 1964 and imports of capital goods are expected to be 9 per cent more than in1963.Exports24. We do not expect the rate of growth of imports to be matched byexports in the period to the end of 1964.(*) Sugar imports are valued in the trade accounts at world prices, although nearly three-quarters of them are brought at prices fixed under agreements with Commonwealth and other countries whichare currently much lower than world prices. The trade account figures are adjusted before arriving at imports in the balance of payments. The increased balance of payments cost of sugar in 1963compared to 1962 is forecast to be some  41 million; this compares with an increase in c i f termsof some  108 million. In 1964 the increased balance of payments cost as compared with 1963 is forecast to be  12 million; this compares with an increase in c.i.f. terms of some  32 million.
^ 25. So far this year exports have risen very sharply-in the third, quarterpiey were .8 per cent higher than at the end of 1962; we expect the increase in1963 compared with 1962 to be over 7 per cent, the best result since 1956. the exceptionally rapid rate of increase this year owes something both to our relativelypoor performance late in 1962 and to an above average increase in export prices.These factors alone would militate against expansion continuing at the recent rate,and this is not expected. Nevertheless the increase we forecast from 1963 to1964 5\ per cent in value and 3^ per cent in volume would be above theaverage of the last decade. (During 1964 we expect the increase in the volume of exports to be about 2\ per cent, compared with about 7 per cent during 1963.)26. During the past two years our exports to the overseas sterling areahave recovered strongly. We expect a further expansion next year, reflecting inpart the better export earnings foreseen for primary producing countries. our exports to the overseas sterling area are likely to increase by 8 per cent in 1963compared with 1962, but. we think it unlikely that further growth will be as fastand the increase in 1964 is put at 5 per cent. The rate of growth of our exportsto Western Europe has been slowing down: it was 14 per cent between 1961 and1962 and may be about 12 per cent this year. No sharp recovery in private investment is expected in Western Europe, and the outlook in France and Italy,to which our exports have been increasing very rapidly, is uncertain. These areamong the reasons leading us to expect a slowing down in the rate of growth of exports to Western Europe to 6 per cent next year. Exports to North Americawere adversely affected at the end of last year by the pause in the United Stateseconomy and the United States dock strikes and by a large fall in exports to canada at that time. This year there has been a good recovery in exports to theUnited States and further growth is expected as the United States economycontinues to expand. In Canada the removal of the surcharges in April has not sofar been followed by any substantial increase and little further expansion can be counted on. Nevertheless we expect exports to North America as a whole to do better next year than for some time an increase of 8 per cent is forecast between1963 and 1964 compared with a 3 per cent rise in 1962 and a \\ per cent fallthis year.27. The forecast of total exports does not allow for any further sharpincrease in exports of non-manufactures which contributed more thanproportionately to the expansion in 1962 and 1963. It implies a relatively slowgrowth m per cent) in 1964 in exports of machinery, which rose sharply earlythis year but have since been flat. The engineering order book appeared to befalling earlier this year but the stock of orders remains substantial and the latestavailable figures of orders on hand show some recovery. Exports of cars should do well and may increase by 15 per cent in 1964; the rise of less than 5 per cent in1963 partly reflects the big loss sustained in Canada. Steel exports are expectedto fall.28. In the first half of 1963 we were probably about holding our share of world trade in manufactures. The forecast implies that we will roughly hold our share for the time being, though some resumed loss of share might be developingbefore the end of next year.29. We expect the rise in export prices this year to be about 3 per cent,compared with an average rise of 1 per cent over recent years. There has been asubstantial rise in the prices of non-manufactures. There has also been a sharpincrease in textile prices and the downward drift of chemical prices appears tohave been reversed. There has, however, been little if any sharpening in the rateof increase in the prices of engineering goods. We assume that for exports as awhole prices will increase by 1^-2 per cent next year. That we assume export prices to be rising faster than in recent years does not mean that we think our ability to compete on costs will diminish.Visible balance30. The forecasts of imports and exports taken together suggest that the visiblebalance will show a considerably larger deficit next year, about  155 millioncompared with  35 million in 1963. Allowing for seasonal factors there would belittle change in the deficit between the first and second half of 1964.31. There would be a small improvement in the terms of trade over the forecastperiod as a result of the increase in the average price of exports exceeding that ofimports.
Invisibles ^32. After the large improvement which took place in 1962, net invisifrUearnings are expected to increase again this year, though by a smaller amount. Nextyear there may be no change. In figures the surplus was about  140 million in 1962and is expected to be about  170 million in both 1963 and in 1964. That we expectno further increase in net invisible earnings next year does not mean that we thinktheir resumed upward trend has come to an end. The explanation rather is that theimproving elements are temporarily masked by the rise in debits which accompaniesa rapid expansion of the economy.33. Compared with the past a relatively small increase in net expenditureabroad by the Government is foreseen this year and next, and the deficit on travelis expected to increase slightly in each year. The important changes, however, arein the field of interest, profits and dividends. Oil earnings are likely to rise much lessin 1963 and 1964 than in 1962, which was a very favourable year. The volume of thecompanies&apos; sales is increasing, but there is continuing pressure on their profit margins. The present negotiations with O.P.E.C. are likely to lead to increase inpayments to Middle East Governments. If the latest offer by the companies were accepted it might reduce net oil earnings next year by  10 million or more from thelevel forecast. There will not be in 1964, as there was in 1962 and 1963, a benefit tothe I.P.D. account by way of lower interest payments on external sterling liabilitiesas a consequence of lower interest rates. Indeed the assumption we necessarily make that United Kingdom interest rates will not change next year may be an optimisticone in this context. Also the favourable movement of net earnings on direct investment would virtually flatten out in 1963 and 1964, largely as a consequenceof the higher level of activity and profits in the United Kingdom. The rapid expansionof imports and the rise in tramp freight rates counteracts the favourable effect on shipping account of prospectively better receipts from the tanker cross trades and lower charter payments for tankers as a number of the Suez charters expire.Current balance34. The above analysis leads to a forecast surplus on current account of about 140 million in 1963 and of about  15 million in 1964. On a seasonally adjustedbasis the surplus might be a little larger in the second half of 1964 than in the first.This should not, however, be taken as indicative of what is likely to happen in 1965,which is beyond the range of our forecast.United Kingdom Balance of Payments million)       I.

^ong-term capital35. The position on long-term capital account was exceptional in 1961 and1962. In 1961 we had the benefit of the Ford transaction and of substantial advancerepayments of Government debt, as well as of large overseas purchases of UnitedKingdom securities; the latter continued in early 1962. As a consequence there wasa small net inflow of long-term capital in 1961 and in 1962 a net outflow well belowthe average of earlier years. The first half of this year showed a (substantial netoutward movement, amounting to  85 million. The second half of the year is moreunfavourable than the first, and the net outflow over 1963 as a whole may thereforebe of the order of  200 million, thus approximating to the rate of outflow commonbefore 1961. A somewhat higher figure is forecast for 1964, namely, about  235million. These forecasts are, necessarily, of a very speculative kind.36. The level of loan aid disbursed is expected to be only slightly higher in1963 than in 1962. Disbursements have lagged well behind commitments. There aregrounds for expecting some catching up in 1964, e.g., drawings on Section 3 loansby India during 1963 have been unusually low and a substantial increase is expectednext year. The forecasts of Departments responsible for the aid programme haveshown a tendency to over-estimate disbursements in the past, and this has been allowed for in preparing the figures included in this Report. Another item whichgoes to explain the increased outflow on official account next year is the repayment of the 1961 Swiss loan of  18 million. The net outflow on official account would increase by  7 million this year and  40 million next year.37. No very great net change is expected in the direct investment sector. the upward trend of both outward and inward investment is expected to continue, witha small increase in the net outflow in both 1963 and 1964.38. A sharp deterioration in the balance of outward and inward portfolio investment is taking place between 1962 and 1963. The actual swing is expected tobe about  120 million although its full extent is obscured by a change inclassification^1) Borrowing on the London market will be at a higher level, includingthe flotation of a substantial loan by Australia, as well as the effects of opening themarket to a wider number of borrowers. The impact of this is expected to be relieved by increasing disinvestment in South Africa. The strong overseas interestin United Kingdom securities which was evident in 1961 and early in 1962 has sincelapsed and this accounts for most of the substantial deterioration on inward portfolioaccount between 1962 and 1963. Conditions in the United Kingdom in 1964 do not seem likely to attract investment in company securities, but a small allowance hasbeen made for further purchases of gilt-edged securities by overseas residents. little change is foreseen in the net total of portfolio investment between 1963 and 1964.39. Outward investment by the oil industry, which was at a low level in 1962,was roughly in balance with inward investment. The gradual reappearance of a netoutflow seems likely, though probably on a small scale this year and next. If anythingthe estimated net outflow may be on the low side, since the United Kingdomcompanies have liquid reserves(2) ready for investment abroad and since part of the funds for the Milford Haven refinery might be found in the United Kingdom.Identified balance of current and long-term capital v40. The above forecasts lead to a deficit on current and long-term capital account of some  60 million in 1963 and of some  225 million in 1964.(*) In accordance with our usual practice the figures in this report relating to 1962 and earlier years are those which appear in the latest publications on the balance of payments. The figures forthis year and next year, however, are based on a new classification of investment and disinvestmentin United Kingdom gilt-edged securities by certain official bodies overseas and of certain holdings of local authority securities and mortgages, as well as on a new treatment of disinvestment throughthe security dollar market. Allowing for these changes the deterioration on portfolio investment as awhole from 1962 to 1963 is  40 million more than the forecast reveals.(2) As this report is being completed a large investment by Shell in Italy is being considered. Atthe moment its outcome is too uncertain for inclusion in the forecast. But if it materialises it wouldmean that the deficit on current and long-term capital account would be increased by at least  60million, of which at least  45 million would fall on the reserves.

To arrive at a forecast of the balance of monetary movements it is necessaryto consider the possible value of errors and omissions as measured by the balancingitem. Our views on its likely value this year and next are set forth more extensivelyin the Annex. In brief, we expect the balancing item to be negative by  50 million or more this year, and we think it would be optimistic to expect more than a fiatposition next year, and it could again be negative. In conjunction with our forecasts of the identified deficit, this would mean that balance of monetary movements maybe unfavourable by an amount exceeding  100 million in 1963 and is unlikely tobe less than the identified deficit of  220 million in 1964.42. We do not attempt to forecast the amount of the change in the reserves and in the other components of the balance of monetary movements. Much would depend on the pattern of interest rates and on confidence, which, in an electionyear with the balance of payments deteriorating, may be unfavourable. A separatestudy of the prospects for the balance of payments of the overseas sterling areasuggests that next year will be a good one for them. The first half of the year isseasonally favourable, both for their balance of payments and for ours. Theirsurplus with the non-sterling countries should be exerting a favourable influence onthe reserves in the first half of next year, but with our joint seasonal deterioration in the second half of next year there may prove to be a period of serious strain onthe reserves.
annex the BALANCING ITEM1. On the basis of the latest statistics the average level of the balancing itemover the five years up to 1962 is plus  75 million. The difference between this and the figure of  100 million previously quoted as the average balancing item inthese reports is due to the identification of additional credits on current account for these years, which have improved the current balance and reduced thebalancing item. It still appears, however, that a substantial underlying positiveelement remains. On past experience the bulk of this could be expected to arise in the early part of the year.2. In contrast to this experience the balancing item was negative to the extentof  21 million in the first half of 1963. The explanation probably is that duringthe period of pressure on sterling early in the year some unrecorded withdrawal of funds took place (in addition to the large amount recorded) and that an adverse&quot; leads and lags &quot; position developed. Although the pressure subsided after thefirst quarter, United Kingdom interest rates were not very attractive to short-terminvestment here and there was some tightening in credit conditions abroad. Thesecircumstances were not conducive to a reflux of funds or to a rapid unwinding of&quot;leads and lags&quot;: indeed there could have been some further outflow of funds.The strong rise in export shipments probably led to an increase in creditoutstanding, not all of which is recorded, so that this too is likely to have beena negative factor.3. Somewhat similar conditions have continued so far in the second half ofthe year. Thus on the whole it seems unlikely that the balancing item will resume a,positive sign in this period, and its value for the year as a whole may be negativeby  50 million or more.4. In normal circumstances, the underlying positive element might beexpected to reassert itself next year. The slower growth of exports that we foreseeshould mean that unrecorded export credit will be less strong as a negative factorthan in 1963. Interest rate relationships, however, on our assumption of no changein United Kingdom rates, are likely to continue to favour some outward movementof funds; and with the balance of payments deteriorating and an election in theoffing sentiment about sterling is likely to be adverse. We think it would beoptimistic to expect more than a flat position on the balancing item in 1964, andit could again be negative.3722r
