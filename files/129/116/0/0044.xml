(64) 4414th February, 1964CABINETTHE SOUTH-EAST STUDY: DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional Development, ,With, this note I am circulating a draft of a White Paper designed to bepublished at the same time as the South-East Study. The Study itself has been put before the Cabinet by the Minister of Housing and Local Government withCP. (64) 37. The draft White Paper has been discussed by the Committee on regional Development and reflects their conclusions, together with a morearresting final paragraph. The reference to new machinery to implement townexpansions (paragraph 20), however, needs to be settled by the Cabinet.Main Points2. The Study by officials forecasts that the population in the South-East area(east of a line from the Wash to Dorset) is likely to increase by 3% million in theperiod 1961 to 1981. About 2-4 million will be excess of births over deaths, and1 -1 million will represent net inward migration from elsewhere in Britain and overseas. Together with the growing number of jobs in the London conurbation,especially office jobs in Central London, this presents a number of problems whichcall for fresh initiatives by the Government.3. Given the guidance in the Study, most of this population growth can be looked after by local planning authorities, though they will need to makesubstantially increased allocations of land for building (for 2-2^ million extrapeople) in their development plans. To relieve the problems which the Londonconurbation itself will present, the Study recommends also a programme of new and expanded towns, larger than at present, to take by 1981 1-1  million people.Some would be big enough and far away enough from London to act as importantalternative centres for the growth which would otherwise take place aroundLondon itself.Endorsement of Objectives4. The Regional Development Committee agreed that these 20-yearpopulation forecasts, though necessarily subject to review, should be accepted asa realistic, and indispensable, basis for land use planning. It also agreed that new and expanded towns would be needed to take the 1-1 -j- million, though it wouldbe premature in advance of public discussion and consultation with individualplanning authorities to decide where these expansions should take place. Thedraft White Paper endorses these points, but in paragraph 14 avoids any explicitacceptance at this stage of the concept of major alternative centres of growth.Priority for Other Regions. 5. The draft White Paper stresses that the priority the Government havealready given to the development of Central Scotland and the North-East region of England is to be maintained. This will be done (paragraph 31) by determining the extent and location of public investment and industrial building, and phasingCopy No.   673943THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT

SOUTH-EAST ENGLANDForeword1. Today, 18 million people thirty-five out of every hundred in GreatBritain live in South-East England. In the last thirty years the populationof the area has gone up by 3 million. During the next twenty years it islikely to increase by another 3  million, mostly by the process of natural growth. Such a rate of increase creates major problems of land, housing,employment and transport. Their solution is of crucial importance, not only for the very large numbers of people who live and work in the South-East,but for the whole country. Much of our national prosperity depends on the prosperity of South-East England and the distribution of its population and employment must, therefore, be planned so as to promote its maximum efficiency. At the same time a balance must be kept between the growth of the South-East and the needs of other parts of the country.2. The Government decided in 1961 to assess the land requirements ofthe whole South-East over the next 20 years, and to seek solutions for london&apos;s problems over a wide front. The growth of population andemployment in Greater London and the area it dominates had been muchgreater than could have been predicted when the post-war plans wereprepared. The birth-rate had risen and was rising fast and the continuingdecline in the average size of households meant that more homes were needed for the same number of people. London was in danger of choking.Much more land is required for its current needs, and for the future needsof the whole South-East.3. The outcome of this decision by the Government is &quot; The South-East Study &quot;, a report by officials, published at the same time as this white paper, with which it should be read. The Study covers the area south-east of a line from the Wash to Dorset. It is a comprehensive examination ofthe housing and land use problems of Greater London and the South-Eastduring the period up to 1981.Expected Population Growth4. The Study finds that nearly 2\ million of the expected 3^ millionpopulation increase in the South-East over the period 1961-1981 will beexcess of births over deaths, and just over one million net inward migrationfrom other parts of Great Britain, both for employment and for retirement,and from overseas. Further growth probably at a higher rate so far asnatural increase is concerned is likely after 1981.5. It is the Governments intention to build up the prosperity of otherparts of the country, and they are satisfied that the Study takes full accountof this. They accept the Study as a reasonable assessment of the nature and scale of the South-Easfs population problem. Population forecastsover a 20-year period are, inevitably, subject to a considerable margin of error and must therefore frequently be reviewed. This will be done ; andthe sample census already announced for 1966 is being devised with this in mind. Meanwhile the Government are satisfied that these populationestimates provide a realistic basis for planning to meet future land needs.
The Broad Strategy6. The Study&apos;s Proposals. Much of the population growth in the J^-Uh-East will be dealt with through the release of land by local planning afP jri-ties, followed by development, in the ordinary way. The amount of landallocated will have to be increased considerably in order to make proper provision for the expected growth. The Study suggests that such additionalallocations should provide for 2-2J million more people.7. But the central problem of the South-East is disproportionate growth of population and employment in and around London. The Study examinesthree main approaches to this problem.8. One possibility is to have no plan at all, in the hope that the situation would be self-correcting. This would mean that no attempt was made to influence the future pattern of growth in the South-East. Experience sincethe war, however, shows that, if things were left to take their course, too much of the population would continue to concentrate on London and thering around it, thus creating ever more intractable problems of housing and road and rail transport. Such an approach would lead to increasing over-crowding and congestion in London, and to extreme pressure on the metro-politan green belt.9. A second possibility would be to go on as at present. This wouldmean continuing with new towns and town expansions, of a moderate size,designed simply to provide accommodation for London&apos;s overspill population.This would indeed meet a pressing need, but would fail to prevent its recur-rence. It would not solve the basic problem.10. The Study suggests instead a third approach which should, in thecourse of time, alter the distribution of population growth in the South-East,and thus relieve the pressure on London and the surrounding countryside.This would be done through a fresh and much larger programme of new and expanded towns, the individual expansion schemes being on a biggerscale than those in the current programme. They would be centred on placeswell away from London.11. For many years now the number of people living in the Londonconurbation has been falling, although the number of jobs has been rising.London, however, has a high birthrate and there will be many new house-holds with a consequent increase in the demand for houses. But, although many more houses will be needed for Londoners, there is little undevelopedhousing land left in the conurbation and, with the need to redevelop to modern standards, there will have to be an overspill of about one million during the Study period.12. This overspill is included in the 3  million net population growth of the South-East, all of which will have to be accommodated outside theLondon conurbation. The pattern of distribution over the next 20 yearscontemplated by the authors of the Study therefore is :(i) The population of the London conurbation would by the end ofthe period be at about its present level approximately 8 million.(ii) Outside London, land for housing an additional 2-2  million people would be provided by allocations in the development plans of thelocal planning authorities.
(iii) There would be a second generation of new and expanded towns^    planned on a large scale, to accommodate 1-1 \ million people, wellaway from London.13. The Government&apos;s Initial Conclusions. The Government agree thatthe magnitude of the task in the South-East calls for further initiatives. Tosecure a better distribution of the inevitable growth, and to reduce thedominance of London, a radical change in the pattern of development. isrequired. In the Governments view, this can best be achieved if some ofthe population and employment increases which would otherwise take placein London and the congested metropolitan region are brought about inalternative centres of growth.14. The Government, while not departing from their policy of channellingeconomic growth from the South-East to other parts of the country wherever possible, accept the basic objectives of the Study. Accordingly, they acceptthe need for new and expanded towns to accommodate 1-1  million people,in ways which would provide effective relief for the pressures on London.Both private and public enterprise should contribute towards this programme.15. The processes necessary to bring about this development will take some years : in the meantime development of Central Scotland and North-East England, to which the Government have given priority in public invest-ment, will be going ahead.16. Public opinion within and outside the South-East must have anopportunity to express itself before final decisions are taken. At this stage,therefore, the Government do not think it would be right to commit them-selves to the selection of any particular place for expansion, or to the scale and rate of progress of expansion at any particular place.17. The consequences of the Government&apos;s initial conclusions. Accept-ance of the broad objectives will have important implications for policy ina number of related fields.  These fall into three categories:. (i) the pattern of development in the South-East;(ii) problems of employment growth ;(iii) implications for the country as a whole.The Pattern of Development in the South-East18. Development Plans. In the South-East itself, the essence of theproblem is the provision of more land. Local planning authorities will need to bring the land allocations in their development plans into line with up-to-date population estimates, and the Study will enable them to do this. Thisis a matter to which the Government attach the greatest importance. De-velopers whether meeting private or public needs-must be assured of along forward supply of land for development.19. Confidence in the supply of land and the certainty of long termbuilding programmes will contribute towards the development of new build-ing techniques which make better use of skilled labour. This will help towards greater productivity in the construction industry, which the NationalBuilding Agency is designed to promote, and which is essential for the new,higher programme of building.
[20. Machinery for planned expansion. In the planned expansion schemes it will be necessary to keep a close control over the provision ofland for two reasons. The first is to enable the whole programme (g&amp;be phased correctly. The second is to ensure that land is brought forearowfc itis required for development, whether by private enterprise or public agencies.Where the development takes the form of new towns, broadly satisfactorymachinery already exists. The Government intend to work out fresharrangements for carrying through major town expansion schemes in partner-ship with the local authorities, and they envisage that the land needed forthese schemes should be acquired well in advance of needs.]21. The Green Belt. The Study draws attention to the heavy pressures on the green belt around London. The Government have already undertaken to maintain the approved metropolitan green belt and to make substantialadditions to it, and they have no intention of departing from this policy.They will not permit any general extension of the built-up area of London,and they intend that the approved green belt should be substantially extended and strengthened by the addition of hundreds of square miles of open country. They consider nevertheless that, in their search for more housingland, the local planning authorities should consider the possibilities offered by such land as there is in the green belt which in itself contributes little of value to the purpose of the belt. This could only be very small in relationto the whole but such as there is ought to be considered. The local planning authorities must also have the opportunity to re-examine, in the light of thelatest estimates of population growth, the proposals they have made for extending the green belt. The Minister of Housing and Local government does not therefore propose to approve these in their present form.22. Agricultural Land. The Government endorse the view expressed inthe Study that high quality agricultural land should not be taken for urban development wherever there is a practical alternative.23. Railways. There is little likelihood of serious conflict between british railways&apos; plans and the general pattern of future development outlined inthe Study. Where passenger closure proposals are concerned, the Govern-ment, before reaching decisions, will in each case take full account of thepossible developments put forward in the Study. In particular, they will consider whether the possibilities of future development make it desirablethat a line should remain available for future use if required.24. The Channel Tunnel. The Government have recently announced their agreement in principle to the construction of a Channel Tunnel. In reachingthis decision they satisfied themselves that the clear national economic advan-tage which, given certain conditions, is to be expected from the completionof this project would be reinforced by its benefits to other parts of thecountry than the South-East. The plans for reshaping the railway system to meet future demands will naturally include any proper through links between the tunnel terminal and other parts of the country. In this way thebenefits of improved communications with the Continent will be spread far beyond the area of the terminal itself and indeed far beyond the South-East.25. Consultation with Local Authorities. The Study as a whole, and theparticular proposals contained in it, raise many important issues in the South-East.  The Minister of Housing and Local Government will now consult all
the local planning authorities affected and any other local authorities whomaybe concerned. They will be invited to give their views as soon asrJOSjH   and discussions will be arranged with them.Problems of Employment Growth26. Present position. Employment has been growing faster in the* South-East than in any other part of the country. A great part of theemployment growth has been in service industries, such as in commerce,building, distribution, transport and other forms of employment closely5 tied to the populations they serve. There is, however, tight control overexpansions of manufacturing industry, particularly in London, and theSouth-East has been an important source of industry for the development districts.27. Expansion Schemes. On present indications there will certainly bejobs,enough for the increased population of the South-East. The problem is essentially one of distribution. Enough employment will be required inthe right places and at the right time for the new expansion schemes whichare intended to relieve the pressures on London. This will not be an easymatter. The Study suggests various possible sources of employment.However, the provision of employment for these schemes will not beallowed to detract from the effort to develop other parts of the country.In particular, there will continue to be a rigorous examination of individual firms&apos; proposals for industrial expansion in the South-East.28. Offices. It will be of particular importance for the implementation of the Governments decisions on the Study to secure much more de-centralisation of offices from London and this should be an importantsource of employment for some of the expansion schemes.29. Office building in London has been meeting a strong economicdemand, and commercial growth, just like industrial growth, contributesto prosperity. Further much of the commercial activity in London iscomplex and interlinked. The rapid growth of office employment has,however, caused big housing and transport problems over a wide area.The Government have concentrated on improving planning control and providing alternative centres. They have set up the Location of OfficesBureau to encourage and help firms to leave London, and on the basisof the recommendations made by Sir Gilbert Flemming they are pressingahead with more decentralisation of Government work.30. Travel to Work in London. The London White Paper* showed thatgrowth in office employment in London was threatening to exhaust the capacity of the suburban railway lines to carry more workers into central london. British Railways have therefore been making a fresh examinationof their services. The preliminary results show that technically their presentnetwork could cater for many more commuters, though very considerablechanges in the pattern of railway services would be involved. The VictoriaLine, which was approved by the Government in 1962 and is now under construction, will be an important supplement to London Transportsservices but further additions to their network may be needed. british railways and London Transport are developing detailed proposals to* London-Employment:  Housing:  Land (Cmnd. 1952).
increase their capacity. The Government will work with them and withthe local authorities concerned to evolve, in the light of the results ofthe London Traffic Survey, a comprehensive transport plan for J/felon.This must take full account of the plans for new housing and-oSF thefinancial implications.Implications for the Country as a whole- a31. As the Study makes plain, population pressures in the South-Eastare such that planning must begin now even though the greater part ofthe development in the expansion schemes cannot take place until the o1970&apos;s. By determining the extent and location of public investment andindustrial building, and by phasing the release of land for development in expansion schemes, the Government will ensure that the proper develop-ment of the South-East is carried out without prejudicing growth in otherparts of the country. Their machinery which keeps under examinationpolicies which have the most direct bearing on regional development will assist in this. They will modify the existing policies if this should benecessary.32. The Government believe that the process of regional planning can contribute greatly to the wellbeing and prosperity of the country as awhole. They have already published programmes, which are now being implemented, for Central Scotland and the North-East. Studies of other regions are being prepared. In this way the special needs of individualregions can be identified and a proper national balance achieved and maintained. The problems of the South-East are of a different kind fromthose of most other regions, but it is clearly in the national interest thatthey should be dealt with effectively ; the Government intend to ensurethat this is done.Printed in England and published by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office(31434) Wt.   -    75 2/64 St.S.
