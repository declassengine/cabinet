THE SCHOOL LEAVING AGEMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council and Minister for science the Education and Research Policy Committee have considered a proposal by the Minister of Education that the school leaving age should be raised to 16 in1970. A majority agree with the proposal, but the Secretary of State for Scotlanddoubts the wisdom of deciding now to raise the age on a specified date, and theChief Secretary, Treasury, the wisdom of raising it at all. Both recognise, however,that if a date should have to be announced now it could not appropriately be onelater than 1972.The need for a decision2. The Government are committed to the principle of raising the age and todecide before the end of the present Parliament. The Central Advisory council for Education has twice recommended, in the Crowther Report in 1959 and theNewsom Report last year, that the age should be raised in the near future;Crowther proposed some time between 1966 and 1969; Newsom in 1969. TheLabour Party are committed to raise the age &quot; by the end of the decade &quot; and theLiberal Party to start immediately with compulsory part-time education to 18.If an announcement is to be made during the present Parliament it should be madesoon.Arguments in favour of raising the age in 19703. The arguments advanced by the Minister of Education in favour of raising the age not later than 1970 may be summarised as follows:(i) More children are staying at school for an extra year voluntarily, but evenby 1970 the proportion who do so is unlikely to be much above40 per cent, and will be considerably lower in areas where it is thetradition to leave school arid start Work as early as possible. among those who will not stay voluntarily are considerable reserves of talentwhich we need for our economic development. Automation and technological advance demand an increasing supply of technicians and skilled men and women. The Newsom Report emphasised that eventhe 40 per cent of children in the lowest range of ability need a longer period of education for personal development and the consolidation oftheir attainments.(ii) Progress in improving the standard of secondary modern educationdepends on the schools being free to plan a iive-year course for all theirpupils. Not only does the hew Certificate of Secondary Educationpresuppose such a course, so that those who do not stay and take the certificate will get much less than four-fifths of the value of the fullperiod, but those who should be applying themselves to thedevelopment of curricula appropriate to the needs of average and belowaverage children are unlikely to do so seriously until they are assured that a compulsory five-year course is shortly to be introduced.(hi) Some sections of public opinion contrast the Governments readyacceptance of the Robbins Report with Our silence on Newsom. We areaccused of neglecting the great mass of average children in the interestsOf aft elite minority.3714i HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

. (iv) Raising the age with effect from 1970 would mean that the extra yeg^^would begin in 1969 the decision could be announced as raising tfliPKage in 1969 and would apply to children entering secondary schoolin 1965.4.   These arguments would of course largely hold good in Scotland also. Itshould be noted, however, that (a) the projections used in Scotland for the number of pupils staying ohvoluntarily suggest that by 1970 the proportion will still be under 30 percent; y^^--;.y \ aq^d^ti mHb^iti;h(b) in Scotland, where transfer from primary to secondary education takes place one year later than in England, junior secondary courses are designed at present to run for three years: the raising of the age would therefore make it possible to provide not five- but four-year courses of secondary education; and(c) because of the longer primary and shorter secondary course in Scotland,the first pupils to be affected by a change in the leaving age with effect from 1970 would be those entering secondary school in 1966.Arguments against raising the age in 19705. Even from the educational point of view, raising the age in 1970 would notbe pure gain. The Education and Research Policy Committee recognised that therewere educational arguments against it, though only a minority thought themconclusive. They are:(a) By 1970 the supply of teachers will be increasing, but it will still not besufficient to prevent a set-back in staffing standards in the year in whichthe leaving age is raised when the schools will have to accommodate,.over and above their normal increase in population, some 350,000extra children in England and Wales and 60,000 in Scotland. forecasts of the number of teachers who will be available are necessarily uncertain,but it is reckoned that the effect of raising the age, given the full expansionof higher education recommended by Robbins for 1973-74, will be to- postpone the point at which we can expect to have eliminated oversizeclasses from 1976 to 1978 in secondary schools and from 1978 to 1980in primary schools. The delay on the secondary side is not serious,since, whether the age is raised or not, we shall be very near toeliminating oversize classes from 1970 onwards. It is in the primary schools that the immediate impact would be most severely felt, because there would be a tendency (encouraged possibly by the promotion of&quot;teacher training colleges to university status) for teachers to preferservice in secondary schools, and staffing standards in primary schoolsmight deteriorate to the level of the early and mid-1950s. The positionin Scotland will be particularly serious. The elimination of oversizeclasses on Scottish standards (which are lower than English) would be postponed from 1970 to 1975 and English standards of class sizes wouldnot be reached until 1977 or 1978. Since there will be little scope forthe transfer of teachers from primary schools without a completechange in the attitude of the teachers&apos; associations-the shortage injunior secondary schools would seriously depress the quality of theeducation that could be given.(b) Some educationalists, particularly in Scotland, doubt whether raising theage of compulsory attendance would be in the best interests of thechildren of average or below average ability. They also fear that the inevitable overcrowding will do damage to the education of the aboveaverage if the age is raised before adequate teaching staff are available.A Scottish Working Party, which covered much the same ground asthe Newsom Report, recently emphasised that the provision of a largevariety of vocationally centred courses for non-academic children was an essential preliminary to the raising of the age. There is a risk that unless courses followed by these children can be related more closely to their needs an extra year will not merely be wasted but will intensifythe frustration which some already feel in the last year at school. Itmay be significant thut when the leaving age was raised from. 14 to 15the peak age for juvenile delinquency rose similarly.
(c) Some parents may oppose raising the age, either because they do not wanttheir children to stay at school, or because they do and fear that thechange will be detrimental to the interests of children prepared to stay voluntarily. Voluntary education to 16 or beyond could indeed befurther encouraged by other means if the age of compulsory attendancewas not raised.Vocational training in the final year6. The Education and Research Policy Committee considered how thedifficulties involved in raising the age in 1970 could be reduced. They rejected aspolitically unacceptable fixing a different date for Scotland from that fixed for england and Wales; and thought that raising the age by a term, or six months, ata time would be unlikely to yield benefits sufficient to justify the inconvenience tothe schools. They agreed, however, on the importance of ensuring for the non-academic that the additional year was given a strong vocational bias. What theEducation Act requires is not school attendance but &quot; full-time education &quot;, whichmight be provided wholly or partly outside school in colleges of further education,or in colleges of a new kind. (Indeed, in Scotland, the Act simply refers to educationat school or &quot; by other means &quot;.) The extra year might be more acceptable both toparents and pupils if it were made clear that this would not necessarily mean an extra year&apos;s schooling on the present basis. Plans would be worked out for theprovision of new kinds of full-time tuition, perhaps, merging for some with pre-apprenticeship training, designed to help children to make the transition fromschool to the adult world of work and independence. In Scotland, in particular,courses provided at technical colleges might be used fairly extensively to reduce the strain on school staff and accommodation.Raising the age of entry7. One means of making more teachers available for a longer secondary coursewould be to raise the age of entry into whole-time primary education by making thefirst year&apos;s attendance either part-time or voluntary. Although a number of states in Europe and America have, or intend to adopt, the age of 16, or above, as theleaving age, this country is alone in starting compulsory schooling as early as five and almost alone in providing compulsory education for as much as 10 years; eight years is the commonest period in Western Europe, though there are many plans to increase this to nine, and in France it will go up to nine in 1967 and 10 in 1968.The problems of primary education are at present being considered by the central advisory Council for England under the chairmanship of Lady Plowden. TheirReport, expected in 1966, may well comment on the age of entry, and, subject toinformal consultation with Lady Plowden, it might be useful, if we decide to raisethe leaving age, to give some indication that the age of entry will be considered inthe light of the Councils report. We recognise, however, that raising the age of entrymight aggravate the problems of working mothers and create a demand for greaterprovision of nurseries. Owing to the inflexibility of the teacher training regulations in Scotland (already noted in paragraph 5) it is not practicable to redeploy the primary school teaching force in the secondary schools, and raising the age of entrywould therefore afford little relief in Scotland.cost. Particulars of the estimated cost of raising the age in 1970 (on theassumption that all the extra education is given in schools) are shown in the annex.Capital expenditure is estimated to be about  150 million. The net additional current expenditure on education (allowing for the fact that not all the necessary teacherswill be available at first) is expected to be about  45 million a year. This would increase the rate of growth of educational expenditure in real terms between 1967-68and 1971-72 from an estimated 4-5 per cent per annum (if the leaving age were left unchanged) to 5 - 6 per cent per annum. There would also be an indirect cost of nearly  20 million to the Exchequer and (theoretically) up to  13 - 5 million to theNational Insurance Funds. It is estimated that the immediate loss of production from the withdrawal of 15-year-olds from the labour force would be about  150million, equal to one-half of 1 per cent of the Gross National Product, It is notpossible to quantify any potential gains in productivity which might accrue in later years.    &apos;&apos;*0.
Conclusions ^9. The majority of the Committee thought that the balance of advantafllay in raising the age to 16 at the turn of the decade. If our colleagues agree withthis view, it remains for consideration -(a) should the operative date, i.e., the beginning of the extra year, be 1969or a later date?(b) should it be indicated that the concept of full-time education will been larged to comprise largely vocational courses, possibly Outsideschool?(c) should any indication be given that the age of entry to primary educationwill have to be considered when the Central Advisory Council present their report on primary education?Q:  H.Office of the Lord President of the Council. and Minister for Science, S.W. 1.2nd January, 1964.AnnexCOST OF RAISING THE SCHOOL LEAVING AGE IN 1970(a) Current. The theoretical additional educational expenditure is estimated at 65 million a year. This figure, which covers all public authority expenditurein Great Britain, at 1963-64 prices, includes salaries for the extra teachersneeded (22,000 in England and Wales, 4,200 in Scotland) other educationalcosts, and loan charges on the additional building required. But, in practice,many of the additional teachers are unlikely to be forthcoming, and some part of the building would be done within the normal programme; on theother hand, allowance should be made for the trend towards higher standards in the schools. To take account of all these factors, it is thoughtreasonable to assume a net addition of  45 million.(b) Capital. The Departments estimate, that capital expenditure of  115 million will be required on building, which, with additions for sites and equipment,implies a capital investment approaching  150 million. The Ministry ofEducation is of the view that there would be no need to increase buildingstarts agreed up to 1966-67, nor to increase the size of the starts programmeenvisaged for 1967-68. They estimate that additional starts of  43 million would be required in the years 1968-69 to 1970-71. The additionalbuilding starts needed in Scotland would be similarly spread.(c) Effect on growth of educational expenditure. It has been estimated that totalexpenditure at constant prices on primary and secondary schools will rise from  690 million in 1963-64 to  820 million in 1967-68: a growth rate of4-4 per cent a year. It is now estimated that if the school leaving age wasnot changed, expenditure Would rise to  975 million in 1971-72: a growth of 4-5 per cent per annum between 1967-68 and 1971-72. If the age was raised in 1970, the figure for 1971-72 would be  1,020 million: a growth of5-6 per cent per annum in that period. It is not possible to say what effect this would have on the growth rate for education as a whole in the laterperiod, since no useful forecast can now be made of rate of expenditure on higher and further education.(d) Indirect costs. In addition to the direct expenditure from public funds, therewould be indirect effects upon the Exchequer and National Insurance Fund:a loss of  .12-15 million in income tax, almost wholly because of increasedclaims to child allowances; about  4 - 5 million additional family allowances;theoretically, up to  13-5 million in respect of National Insurance benefits and contributions, etc., but in practice this figure would be much less, sincesome jobs filled by school leavers would be taken by those otherwiseunemployed or non-employed.(e) Cost to the economy. In addition to these financial consequences, the cost tothe economy must take into account the loss cf production from thewithdrawal of 15-year-olds from the labour force. This has been roughlyestimated at  150 million. It is not possible to quantify the potential gainsin productivity which might accrue in later years.
