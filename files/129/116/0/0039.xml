Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1964CP. (64) 3911th February, 1964CABINETSHORT BROTHERS AND HARLAND AND THE SKYVAN aircraft memorandum by the Minister of AviationAs a result of the Cabinet decisions to underwrite the Belfast and Seacatprogrammes and to allocate to Short Brothers and Harland sub-contract work on other aircraft, a reasonable level of employment at Belfast on the production sideseems assured. A decision now has to be taken, about the Skyvan civil freighterproject. The details of this are given in the note attached.2. The importance of the decision relates to the design side of Shorts. Thepresent design strength at Belfast is 536 which is a reduction of 145 on the figureof 681 a year ago. Uncertainty about the future is eroding the team, and the betterpeople tend to leave first since it is easier for them to get work elsewhere. It seems unlikely that there will be a long-term future for Shorts as designers of aircraft and guided weapons. But for the next few years we must maintain a small butefficient team if we are to complete the Belfast and Seacat. If we decide not tocomplete the Skyvan, the morale of the Shorts design team will suffer seriously.The danger of key specialists seeking other jobs on the mainland or in the UnitedStates will be greatly increased. The programme on the Belfast would then be setback and made more expensive. If we approve the Skyvan the design team will beheartened and the rate of erosion slowed down.3. The commercial basis of the Skyvan project is set out in the note attached.Shorts are optimistic about the market prospects for the aircraft. But there is, ofcourse, a risk that not enough aircraft will be sold for the Company to break-evenon their total investment. On balance I would judge that the advantages to be gained by continuing the project outweigh the risks of loss of part of the further investmentneeded to complete the programme. The firm are satisfied that they can find thenecessary money to put the Skyvan into production  1-6 million within the 10 million already allocated to them under the conditional grant made in 1962&apos;for the completion of the Belfast and Seacat programme. The Government ofNorthern Ireland have, I understand, agreed to assume a 25 per cent share of theliability arising from this commitment on the same basis as their participation inthe initial conditional grant agreement.4. I seek the Cabinet&apos;s approval to authorise Shorts to complete thedevelopment and initial production of the Skyvan at an additional cost estimatedat  1-6 million on the understanding that(i) they can do this with no increase in the maximum sum of  10 millionalready allocated to them under the conditional grant arrangements forthe completion of the Belfast and Seacat programme.(ii) That this approval should be conditional upon the Northern ireland government agreeing to assume a 25 per cent share of the liabilityarising from this commitment, on the same basis as their participation in the initial conditional grant agreement.J.

annex the SHORTS TURBO-SKYVAN     -The design of this aircraft was conceived by Short Brothers and Harland in1959-60 and the prototype project launched by them as a private venture. Theaircraft is rugged and unsophisticated, with a box-like compartment as a hold,which can carry up to 18 passengers, or 3,500 lb. of freight, for about 500 miles ata cruising speed of 170 m.p.h. It is intended for both military and civil uses, beingparticularly suitable for &quot; bush-type &quot; operations.2. The piston engined prototype first flew in January 1963. Subsequently fortrials purposes this was re-engined with the French Astazou II turbo-prop engine,but the production version of the aircraft will have the more powerful Astazou Xengines. The results of the flight trials have satisfied the Company that theproduction aircraft will fully meet its specification and the Company are confident that the Air Registration Board will issue a Special Category Certificate of airworthiness in March 1964.3. Ministers will recall that in 1962 it became clear that Shorts would be unable to complete the Belfast and Seacat programmes unless the Government eitherincreased the number of Belfasts on order or undertook to underwrite their expectedcumulative losses. The Government agreed to provide a conditional grant up to 10 million for this purpose ( 2-5 million of which was to be provided by theNorthern Ireland Government). Because of these arrangements the Company arerequired to seek Government approval before embarking on any new project. Butthey had already started on the Skyvan and, in order to enable a judgment to bemade on the soundness of the project, the Ministry of Aviation allowed them tocontinue development work, including the preliminary trials programme on theturbine engined version, which first flew in October 1963. They now needGovernment approval before proceeding further.Market4. In the view of the Ministry of Aviation there is evidence that a considerabledemand for an aircraft of this type exists in various parts of the world. A numberof foreign companies are known to be planning similar aircraft and although this may mean that the world market will have to be shared, it confirms Shorts&apos; ownassessment of the potential.5. The Company are unable to accept firm orders until they can give customersan assurance that the project will be carried through, and a reasonably reliableindication of delivery dates. British United Airways are now interested in acquiringat least two aircraft for their Channel Islands service. In addition Shorts have secured letters of intent from Wien Alaska Airlines Inc., and Northern ConsolidatedInc. covering some nine aircraft in all. Other likely purchasers according to Shortsare Trans Australia Airlines, Ansett / A.N.A. and Connellan Airways, who areexpected to acquire three or four each. In addition, thirteen other airlines are showinginterest and enquiries have been received from a further twenty-two throughout theworld.Employment6. On the design side, completion of the project is expected to employ anaverage of 70 men for the first year, 45 for the second, and about 30 thereafter todeal with special customer requirements. But in full production, employment onthe basis of an output of 25-30 aircraft per annum direct and indirect would amount to 500 to 800 per annum. Shorts estimates of forward loading indicate thattowards the end of the decade, provided they attain the benefit of the maximumprogramme of sub-contracting on the HS-681, their total labour force should notbe much short of its present level of 7,000. They are, however, expecting employmentin 1966 and 1967 to fall to between 4,000 and 5,000.
Twarket Cost of Project7. The Company have spent  1 -2 million on the Skyvan programme. Of this about  400,000 had been written off from the Company&apos;s accounts before theconditional grant of  10 million for the Belfast was approved. They now estimate that a further  1-6 million is needed to complete the development programme, toprovide a set of production jigs and tools, and to cover education costs on an initialproduction batch of 10 aircraft. They would propose to embark on the constructionof these 10 aircraft at once and the programme will cost about  800,000. Only about 250,000 of this will, however, be committed in the first year and by then theCompany would expect to have covered their production expenses by firm orders.8. The Company estimate the cost price of the aircraft as  81,500 and theprobable selling price as  97,500. Thus, with a potential margin of  16,000 on eachsale, if 173 aircraft are sold, the whole of the  2-8 million investment would be recovered. If 98 were sold, the  1 -6 million still to be invested would be recovered.9. The Ministry of Aviation have investigated the estimates of development and production cost put forward by Shorts, and are satisfied that they are realisticfor the programme proposed. Naturally, as with any new aircraft development,there can be no guarantee that unforeseen problems will not arise and invalidatethese estimates, but a reasonable margin has been included to cater for contingencies,and the R.A.E. at Farnborough are assisting the Company with its programme.10. The Company claim that even if the whole of the investment on this project is unrecovered from production sales it would still be possible for it to be written off from the Company&apos;s accounts without any increase in the existingmaximum of  10 million on the conditional grant provided that, as the Companyexpect, the first 10 production aircraft are sold in good time. In the last 18 months the outlook for the Company has improved by reason of several items of income which could not be taken into account in the original calculations, such as estimated profits on the VC-10 sub-contract, some increased capital grants fromthe Northern Ireland Government, increased profits on some earlier projects,notably the Britannia, and increased sales of Seacat guided missiles. They nowreckon to be between  2 million and  3 million better off in 1966 than originallyexpected. It would be reasonable therefore to expect that the whole of the launching costs of the Skyvan, including the  1-6 million that has yet to be committed, could be accommodated within the current  10 million limit.11. If it were agreed that Skyvan should be assisted in this way, it wouldhave to be made clear to the Northern Ireland Government that their share of the 10 million conditional grant would still stand at  2-5 million notwithstanding that some of this money would be used to support Skyvan. It was understood thatthe Northern Ireland Government would see no objection to this.
