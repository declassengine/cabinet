miHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 46th January, 1964Copy No.   58CABINETDISREGARD BY THE NATIONAL ASSISTANCE BOARD OF THENATIONAL INSURANCE INCREASES FOR WIDOWS&apos; CHILDRENMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance on 9th December, 1963, the Cabinet approved the national insurance increasesnow to be given for widows&apos; children, and proposed (CM. (63) 10th Conclusions,Item 2, Conclusion (2)) that these increases should be disregarded in the calculation of national assistance payments. Some members of the Committee on Pensions and national Insurance subsequently agreed with me that there were great difficulties about providing exceptionally for such a disregard; and I was asked to circulate amemorandum for the further consideration of the Cabinet, setting out the arguments for and against the proposal.2. When the Cabinet considered this matter in connection with the proposalsfor the improvement of the national insurance allowances for the children ofwidowed mothers, it was presented only with the argument for such a disregard.It was argued that without it the proposals would leave 14,000 widowed mothersat present on national assistance no better off, because their national insurance benefit increase would be offset by an equal national assistance reduction. It is truethat, in the absence of a disregard provision, there would be complaints on behalfof this small minority of widowed mothers who received no immediate benefit, butprevious experience suggests that there would be no serious difficulty. The positionwould be one which I would not feel unhappy to defend on Second Reading, and thiswould be the only occasion on which it could be raised if there were no disregardclause in the Bill.3. On the other hand, there are strong arguments against introducing a specialdisregard into national assistance:(1) It has for a long time been the policy to accompany overall increases in national insurance by smaller increases in national assistance, in orderto make sure that about a million retirement pensioners whose incomesare supplemented derive some net benefit. On the other hand, it wasnot thought necessary in 1956 to accompany the preferential national insurance benefit for widowed mothers&apos; children by any similarpreferential treatment in national assistance. Indeed, to have done so would have defeated the primary object of the exercise, which was toreduce the proportion of widowed mothers on national assistance.Subsequent increases in the preference for widowed mothers&apos; childrenhave also been unaccompanied by preferential treatment on national assistance. To take special action on this occasion, which would have theeffect of maintaining the numbers of widowed mothers on national assistance, would be a complete reversal of this policy.(2) The national assistance scheme provides for a number of disregards, but what is now suggested would be the first disregard of any part of an ordinary national insurance benefit. It would strike for the first time at the basic principle of the relation between national insurance and assistance, whereby assistance payments are intended to supplementinsurance payments in cases where these would otherwise be inadequate to meet need.3723
(3) If this principle were abandoned and a disregard of a part of a mam-national insurance benefit were conceded, it would be extremely difficultto resist its extension. I could, for example, see no reason to disregardonly the present increases, and refuse to disregard the whole of theamount by which the children&apos;s allowances for widowed mothers exceed the other children&apos;s allowances. It would greatly increase the difficultyof resisting the persistent pressure for a disregard of graduated pension and increments for postponed retirement, seeing that the Board^alreadydisregards the first 15s. of private occupational pensions. Concessionsof this kind would be very expensive.(4) One effect of a national assistance disregard in relation to widowed motherswould be to oblige the Board to differentiate in favour of widowed mothers, as against the far larger number of other lone women with children, such as deserted wives, for whom the Board is providing. Itis difficult to see any justification for this differentiation in a schemewhich aims to deal with people in accordance with their needs. It wouldcertainly put the Board itself under pressure to extend the concession in other ways.4.  I hope the Cabinet will therefore agree that no provision for a disregardshould be made in the Bill.R. W.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C. 2.3rd January, 1964.
