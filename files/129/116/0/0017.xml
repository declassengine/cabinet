Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 17 Copy No. 6521st January, 1964.CABINETTHE HOLY LOCH MEMORANDUM-CLAIMS AND INDEMNITY PROVISIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Minister of DefenceDuring the negotiations with the United States Administration about theadministrative arrangements covering the facilities for United States polaris submarines in the Holy Loch, the attitude adopted by the United States on thequestion of claims and indemnity arising from a nuclear incident or accident hasraised issues on which we wish to consult our colleagues. Both the principle onwhich liability should be assessed and the basis on which claims should be metare in question.2. Negotiations for a Memorandum of Understanding covering theadministrative and financial arrangements started shortly after Mr. Macmillan&apos;announcement to the House of Commons in November 1960 of the offer of facilities in the Holy Loch. They have been protracted, largely owing to the difficultyof reaching a mutually acceptable formula for the claims and indemnity provisions,and it was not until the end of 1962 that one was found. The formula explicityrecognised that claims should be settled under the terms of the NATO status of Forces Agreement, which applies automatically to all claims arising from theofficial activities of United States forces in this country except those for damage to property (as distinct from personal injury and loss of life) resulting from theactivities of United States warships. The formula removed this exception andwould have enabled us, as of right, to process all such claims ourselves and to recover 75 per cent of the cost from the United States. The formula also providedthat claims should be resolved in accordance with the principle of sole and absolute liability of the operator. We agreed to a maximum of $100 millions for claims arising from any one incident, with provision for negotiation through diplomatic channels in respect of any claims beyond this amount. We also accepted a 10-yearlimit on claims. We had to accept this formula in the form of a statement of intentby the United States Administration, in which it was made clear that theAdministration would have to seek appropriations from Congress for claimsaccepted.3. The United States have now withdrawn their agreement to the 1962formula. They have explained that, since the formula was adopted, they have had discussions with other countries about visits to their ports by United Statesnuclear-powered warships and that these countries have shown increasing interestin the Anglo-United States arrangements for the use of the Holy Loch. Theyconsider that these arrangements will become a precedent for movements of nuclear-powered warships throughout the world. They say that they cannot offerIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
other countries who are not parties to the NATO Status Agreement the formWfagreed with us in 1962, and they maintain that the negotiation of individualarrangements on liability with each country prior to visits would seriously restrict the freedom of movement of the growing United States nuclear-powered fleet. Forthese reasons they wish to avoid any detailed formula on liability and suggest thatthe United Kingdom and other countries can have confidence that, in the unlikely event of any nuclear damage occurring, the United States Government will actpromptly to make full restitution. The United States have offered to express their position in the Memorandum in the following terms:&quot; Claims following from a nuclear incident or accident involving one ofthe submarines Or their supporting craft will be dealt with through diplomatic channels in accordance with customary procedures for the settlement ofinternational claims under generally accepted principles of law and equity.&quot;After further discussion they have agreed to add:&quot; In this connection the United States Government, at international conferences where this subject has been discussed, has supported the principleof sole and absolute liability channelled exclusively to the operator of a nuclearreactor.&quot;4. Annexed to this Memorandum is an account of the legal position in theUnited Kingdom with regard to nuclear liability. It will be seen that, so far as her majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, the principle of sole and absolute liability of the operator is accepted policy. Although the United Kingdom legislation onthis point is so far restricted to land-based reactors, it has been agreed that legislation should be introduced applying the same principle to the operators of nuclear ships. Its inclusion in the Holy Loch Memorandum would be in line withthe general attitude we have adopted on this subject, e.g., in the negotiations forthe Brussels Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships. Moreover,Parliament was told, on 28th February, 1961, by the then Minister of Defence,that claims arising out of the Holy Loch arrangements would be dealt with underthe Visiting Forces Act, 1952 (which enabled effect to be given to the NATOStatus of Forces Agreement), and that liability would be determined in accordancewith principles similar to those embodied in the Nuclear Installations (licensing and Insurance) Act, 1959 (under which the principle of sole and absolute liabilityis applied to the operators of nuclear installations on land). The claims andindemnity provisions we accept in the Holy Loch Memorandum must be consistent with these assurances to Parliament.5. Our object is, as it has been from the start, to ensure that, in the unlikely event of a nuclear accident, people who have valid claims should have them settledexpeditiously and in full, and that this should be done from public funds of either the United Kingdom or the United States. A further requirement is that the cost,or a least a substantial part of it, should be borne by the United States.6. The 1962 formula covered these requirements. The United States formulaquoted in paragraph 3 above, even with the addition of the explanatory phrase,falls some way short of them. There are as yet no &quot; generally accepted principlesof law &quot; applicable to the settlement of claims for nuclear damage. In the absenceof explicit acceptance in the Memorandum of the application of the principle ofsole and absolute liability, it would be open to the United States to reducecompensation because the negligence of the claimant had contributed to the nuclearaccident, or to contend that the United States should pay part only because thenegligence of a third party was a contributing cause. This might be awkward in thecase, for example, of a nuclear accident resulting from a collision at sea in which both the submarine and the other vessel involved were at fault. Moreover while we should be able to quote the explanatory phrase in support of our diplomaticrepresentations, the formula establishes no right to restitution.7. The other main defect of the new United States proposals is that theUnited States have made it clear that they do not intend the NATO Status of forces Agreement to apply to any claims for nuclear damage under theMemorandum. There are two consequences of this:(a) Under the Status Agreement, all claims to which the Agreement applies(which are restricted to death or personal injury in the case of claims
8. If no action was taken to exclude the application of the Status Agreementwe would be entitled to hold, in the event of a nuclear incident or accident, that theAgreement applied and covered claims for injury or loss of life. It is however a mootpoint whether, in view of the attitude the United States have so far adopted, weshould in practice be able to enforce the Agreement. The only way of ensuring this seems to be to persuade the United States to accept an explicit reference to theStatus Agreement in the Memorandum.9. It is of course open to us to insist that since we are providing the facilities,the provisions on claims and indemnity should be drafted in accordance with our requirements. But if we failed to secure these we could not contemplate terminating the offer of facilities on this account. The position therefore would be that the submarines and their supporting craft would continue to use the Holy Loch, as theyhave done for nearly three years, without any formally agreed arrangementsconcerning safety, finance and claims. Although there have been no practicaldifficulties so far, this is not a satisfactory state of affairs and would be indefensiblein Parliament if anything should go wrong or even if it should become known thatthere was no proper cover. This emphasises the importance to us of pressing forexplicit reference to the Status Agreement.10. There is a further consideration. Admiral Rickover, who has virtualcomplete control of everything to do with marine nuclear propulsion in the UnitedStates, has taken a close personal interest in the Memorandum, particularly in the safety provisions, with which he is directly concerned. We depend heavily on hisco-operation for the supply of essential equipment for our nuclear submarine and Polaris programmes, and he has already used this position to insist that formsof words he had agreed in the course of ad referendum negotiations with the ChiefScientific Adviser to the Minister of Defence should not be subsequently amended.We have accepted this position. The only outstanding issue is the matter of claims and indemnity. Since we have reason to fear that until the whole memorandum is concluded the supply of certain vital equipment for our submarines may beheld up, it is important to find a compromise soon on the claims and indemnityprovisions.11. There is no prospect of getting the United States to go back to the 1962formula. Nor is it likely that they will commit themselves any further on theprinciple of sole and absolute liability than they have done in the new formulathey have offered. They are in fact likely to resist any changes in this formula onthe grounds that it has already been approved by the Congressional Committeesconcerned and that they cannot afford to be more detailed in a formula which willbe regarded as a precedent for future agreements in this field. As explained abovehowever the formula is inadequate for our purposes.arising from the operation of a ship) are dealt with in accordance withour own laws and regulations and we are entitled to reimbursement of 75 per cent of the cost we incur in meeting them. The United states proposals mean that we should have to rely entirely on diplomaticnegotiation for the satisfaction of claims. While it would be open tous to seek 100 per cent restitution, our ability to secure this would depend not only on the good faith of the United States government but also on the willingness of Congress at the time to authorise thenecessary appropriations. Practical experience has shown that wherethe United States authorities deal with claims, or claims cannot be paidwithout their agreement, negotiations are liable to be very protracted.(b) The Status Agreement applies automatically to the United States Forces inthe United Kingdom. (The restriction to death and personal injury wasexplicitly waived in the 1962 fomula.) To give effect to the UnitedStates intention there would have to be agreement between the twoGovernments that the Status Agreement should not apply. Anannouncement would then have to be made under Section 9 (2) of the visiting Forces Act, 1952, that Holy Loch Claims were excluded fromits application. This would immediately be seen to be directly contraryto the assurances given to Parliament in 1961 (see paragraph 4), and forthe United States to argue, as they have done, that their new formula is consistent with these assurances is wholly fallacious.
12. We must recognise that we are in a weak negotiating position. We havdto find a formula which stands a chance of acceptance by the United States and yet fulfils our minimum requirement. We consider that, as the next step, we should attempt to secure United States acceptance of a formula on the following lines:Explicit recognition that the NATO Status Agreement applies.Explanatory statement about liability as in the formula the Americans have offered.$100 million maximum for total claims from any one incident settled underthe Status Agreement (if the United States insist on retaining this fromthe 1962 formula).Settlement in accordance with the new United States formula of any claimsnot covered by the Status Agreement (i.e., claims for property damage and claims for damage arising from an incident or accident outside Britishwaters) or where the $100 million maximum is exceeded.We invite our colleagues to agree to this course.R. A. B.P. T.20 th January, 1964ANNEXIt is possible that the common-law principle of absolute liability would applyto the operation of a nuclear reactor, but this question has not been tested in thecourts. It is now, however, an academic question in the United Kingdom, since theliability of operators of nuclear reactors is governed by statute, in particular the nuclear Installations (Licensing and Insurance) Act of 1959 which imposes absolute liability on the Atomic Energy Authority and on other operators of nuclear reactorsin the United Kingdom. As to the application of the principle to nuclear-poweredships, the Law Officers have advised that it is doubtful whether the principle wouldbe held to apply to damage caused by a nuclear ship. There is as yet no legislation in this field in the United Kingdom but Ministers have decided that legislation whichwould apply the principle to nuclear ships should be introduced.2.  The main reasons behind the acceptance of the principle are:(i) Absolute liability places the increased risk on the person who creates it.At least for the time being, the use of nuclear reactors is unusual andmust be regarded as relatively hazardous, either by reference to the likelihood of accidents occurring (the difficulty of controlling the materialused) or by reference to the uncertainties which must follow fromrelatively short experience of reactors in operation.(ii) It would be unusually difficult to prove what specific act of negligencecaused the plaintiffs damage, by reason of the manner in which reactorsoperate and also by reason of the kind of damage which they would cause, including in particular the possibility of considerably delayeddamage. It would be inequitable if an injured person failed to recoverdamages through his inability to point to the crucial act of negligence.3. The principle of sole liability places liability on the operator of a reactorto the exclusion of suppliers of equipment, employees, to the exclusion of theliability both of a tortfeasor, i.e., a third party whose negligence contributes tocausing the damage, and normally of the claimant himself whose negligence may also have contributed. Sole liability is generally a concomitant of absolute liabilityand is particularly important in the nuclear reactor field. It enables the plaintiff to identify a defendant with relative ease and it enables a defendant to controlsettlement of all claims arising from one incident. The principle is accepted UnitedKingdom policy, particularly because of a third reason, namely that it avoidsduplication of insurance cover (which the insurance market could not support) by enabling cover for a nuclear installation to be concentrated on one person.
p&apos; 4. The application of the principle of sole and absolute liability to theoperation of nuclear reactors has been consistent United Kingdom policy at leastsince 1954 when it was applied to the Atomic Energy Authority in the atomic energy Authority Act. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have supported the adoptionof the principles as the basis for a series of international conventions concerningthird party liability in relation to the use of nuclear energy:Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy,of 29th July, 1960.Brussels Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships of25th May, 1962.Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage of 19th May,1963.The United Kingdom has taken a leading part in the drafting of these conventions(it is probable that we will become a party to all of them). There can be nodoubt that, internationally, it is now accepted as a fact that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment consider that the principle of sole and absolute liability is appropriate to the operation of nuclear reactors, including reactors on board ships. many other countries have already adopted the principle in their internal legislation.Indeed, it can now be expected that any countries which introduce legislation on the question of nuclear liability will adopt sole and absolute liability as the basic principle of that legislation.5. In the United States where, at present, the various laws of the individualStates determine the circumstances in which liability arises for nuclear damage(some providing for absolute liability, others not), there would presumably haveto be further legislation if the United States intended to participate in any of theinternational Conventions. In the case of the United States nuclear merchant ship Savannah, United States legislation provides for determination of liability in accordance with the local law, (e.g., in Scottish waters, the law of Scotland).Once the legislation referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 1 above is ineffect, the United States Government will have to accept the application of theprinciple of sole and absolute liability to Savannah in respect of damage sufferedin the United Kingdom, including United Kingdom territorial waters.6. United Kingdom acceptance of the principle of the sole and absolute liability of the operator of a nuclear installation can be seen as a reflection of the concern, which is particularly felt in Parliament, that private individuals shouldnot have to carry any additional risk involved in the use of nuclear energy.
