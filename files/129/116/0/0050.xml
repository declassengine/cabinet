(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE FRCFERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT;PROGRESS OF THE WORKOF THE RAIL AND ROAD TRANSPORT committee memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Cabinet invited me at their meeting on 17th January(C.M, (64) 5th Conclusions, Minute 4) to keep them informed of theprogress of the Rail and Road Transport Committee&apos;s considerationof the problems arising out of the British Railways Board&apos;s programme for rail closures.   I can now report on the problem of holiday resorts,and on proposals, which the Committee have approved, to announce a .representative group of decisions by the Minister of Transport at a press conference at the end of February as a means of illustrating tothe public the care that is taken to weigh the savings expected from aparticular closure against the hardship which may be caused to thepublic.Holiday Resorts2.       The Minister of Transport announced in a written reply to a parliamentary Question on 12th February, with the agreement of theChairman of the Railways Eoard, that closure proposals affectingholiday resorts which had not yet been published would not take effect,even if approved, until after 1st October, and that in consideringproposals already published he would bear in mind the possible effecton holiday travel arrangements this summer.   In this context the term&quot;holiday resort&quot; is not confined to seaside places: it includes, forexample, Buxton, Crieff and Keswick.Announcement of decisions3.       Out of a total of 330 proposals listed in Appendix 2 to &quot;ReshapingBritish Railways&quot; 177 had been published up to the end of January.   Oneof these was not objected to and the Board are free to proceed;  103 arebefore the Transport Users1 Consultative Committees;  and 73 havereached the Minister of Transport.   The Ministers decision has been announced in 16 cases:  consent was refused in one and given in 15.Twelve decisions have been taken but not announced.    By the end ofFebruary this number will be about 20 and the group will include thefirst refusal to approve a proposal to discontinue passenger services on a main-line (the Central Wales line from Shrewsbury to Swanseavia Craven Arms and Llanelly) and possibly one or two refusals relat-ing to proposals in Scotland,   A number of the consents are subjectto conditions requiring the Railways Board to provide alternative meansof transport.4.       These 20 cases will therefore constitute a representativeselection.   The announcement of these at a press conference can be usedto impress on the public that consent is given only after carefulCOPY NO.18th February, 1964CABINET-1-
462 WDconsideration of all aspects of a proposal, social as well as financial;that it is by no means automatic;  and that detailed conditions are laiddown to ensure that where a closure might cause hardship appropriateremedies are provided.   The Committee believe that the value of this operation will outweigh any criticism there may be that the announce-ment of consents has been delayed to enable refusals to be announced at the same time.5.       The press conference will be timed in consultation with theMinister without Portfolio.   It is not intended to be repeated.   There-after decisions will normally be announced as they are taken; but ifseveral proposals affect one area they may be announced as a group,particularly where consent to one of them is being refused.Deferment of the publication of certain proposals,       The Cabinet approved on 17th January the proposal that theMinister of Transport should seek the postponement of the publica-tion of proposals indicated in paragraph 9 of CP. (64) 16.   TheMinister has approached the Chairman of the Railways Eoard about these, and on one more of a similar kind (Birkehhead - Helsby), andhas secured his agreement to the postponement of the publication ofall but one - Manchester - Gloss op, the arrangements for thepublication of which had gone too far to be reversed.   The Chairmanhas thought it right, however, to draw attention to the fact that the eight postponed proposals are expected to produce a net saving of  829, 000 a year if the lines are closed to passenger traffic alone and an additional  456, 000 if they are also closed to freight traffic.B.Office of theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, S.
