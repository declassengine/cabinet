Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1964CP. (64) 41 Copy No.11th February, 1964CABINETBRITISH SUGAR corporation memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodFollowing our discussion on 4th February (CM. (64) 9th Conclusions,Minute 4) the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have discussed the position withtrie Chairman of the British Sugar Corporation (the B.S.C.). He and his board would be prepared, if we insisted, not to increase the dividend in respect of the1963-64 financial year, or until the new financial arrangements come into effect inOctober. He would, however, want to be able to say that the Board intended tomake an interim distribution early in the financial year beginning in October.2. In the course of the discussion, the question arose whether there organisation scheme discussed in 1961 would be a better approach than the oneoutlined in CP. (64) 24.3. Briefly this involves the conversion of each ordinary share into twopreference shares. These would need to carry a dividend of \\ per cent or 5 per centin order to persuade the majority of shareholders to accept the change. In effectthey would be getting an increase in their effective dividend from 7 per cent to or 10 per cent in exchange for giving up all claims on the assets and profits ofthe B.S.C. other than those required to meet the preference dividend.4. The equity of the Corporation would then be left in public hands. either the present Treasury holding would be left unconverted; or a new share could be created and given to the Sugar Board. Either way all growth in assets and profitswould accrue to the public. Tate &amp; Lyle would strongly object to the B.S.C. being transferred into the ownership of the Sugar Board, but not to the Treasury. there might, however, be some difficulties in deciding exactly what dividends theTreasury ought to receive on its shareholding. It would also be necessary to make arrangements to ensure fully efficient management.5. The advantage of this scheme is that it merely gives formal expression towhat is in practice the existing state of affairs. It is also much simpler. As against this it transfers 100 per cent of the effective ownership and control to the Treasury.Amd we shall have to concede a significantly higher dividend to the existingshareholders in return for their giving up their rights as ordinary shareholders.In 1961 my colleagues felt that the balance of argument was against carrying through this scheme, but a final decision was never taken because of theChancellor^ request to commercial firms not to increase their dividends.6. I ask my colleagues to agree that a reorganisation scheme for the B.S.C.should be introduced and put to shareholders for approval; and to decide whetherthe scheme should be the one outlined in CP. (64) 24 or the one outlined inparagraphs 3 to 5 above.C.
