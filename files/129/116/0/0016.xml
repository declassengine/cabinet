!S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 16 Copy No.   6014th January, 1964CABINETTHE BRITISH RAILWAY BOARDS PROPOSALS FOR CLOSING CERTAINPASSENGER services memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i was invited to report to the Cabinet on the consideration which the rail and Road Transport Committee has given to the British Railway Board&apos;s proposalsfor withdrawing certain passenger services listed in Appendix 2 to their report&quot; Reshaping British Railways &quot;.2. The Rail and Road Transport Committee have continued the workinitiated last June by a Sub-Committee of the Committee on the reorganisation of the Railways under the chairmanship of my predecessor. Our purpose has been to consider to what extent it was possible for the Government to influence the sequence in which the Railway Board brought forward their proposals in such aWay as to minimise controversy and to ensure that due regard was paid to relevantGovernment policies such as regional development and the management of urbantraffic.The Statutory procedure3. The procedure laid down by the Transport Act, 1962, for the considerationof the Railways Board&apos;s proposals is briefly as follows:(a) The initiative in bringing forward proposals to withdraw passenger servicesrests with the Railways Board. When they do so depends partly on commercial considerations and partly on the volume of preparatory work which their small administrative staff can handle.(b) Seven weeks&apos; notice must be given of a proposal. During that periodobjections can be lodged by users of the service with the local TransportUsers&apos; Consultative Committee (T.U.C.C.).(c) The T.U.C.C., after, if they think fit, a public hearing of objectors and theBoard, report to the Minister of Transport on the hardship, if any,which they think the closure would cause, and may put forward proposals for alleviating it. The T.U.C.Cs. are not concerned with anyissue other than hardship, and have no authority to considerrepresentations on any other issue.(d) The proposal is then considered by the Minister of Transport, who hasbefore him the T.U.C.C.&quot;s report and all other relevant material,including the views of.other Government Departments. This is thefirst point at which all the relevant facts and considerations are brought together. The Minister can either approve or refuse to approve theproposal, approve it subject to conditions, e.g., as to the provision of alternative means of transport; and it is possible to defer a decision.4. The extent to which the Minister of Transport can usefully seek to influence the timing of the Board&apos;s publication of their proposals is limited by thefact that the Board have the statutory right to bring forward proposals when theythink fit in the light of their statutory duty to make the railways pay and by thepractical difficulty of judging how long the consideration of a particular proposal will take. The T.U.C.Cs.&apos; hearings are arranged to suit the convenience of their members, who serve part-time and are unpaid, and that of the objectors. It isdifficult for the Government to interfere too much with the Board&apos;s discretion particularly to secure the deferment of proposals-without appearing to withdraw3763
a72our support for their efforts to make the railways pay; and we cannot seek.influence the T.U.C.Cs.&apos; programme of hearings without undermining public confidence in their independence. Any interference with the normal procedure islikely to attract public attention.Proposals advanced5. With these limitations in mind, my Committee and its predecessor have sought to limit the amount and duration of public controversy by identifying (a) proposals the publication of which might be advanced so that where publicopinion was already alarmed a decision would be reached as soon aspossible; and(b) proposals the publication of which might be deferred because for reasons connected with other developments of Government policy it was unlikelythat they could be approved, or in some cases it was unlikely that anearly decision could be reached.6.   The Railways Board agreed in the autumn to advance the publication of proposals to withdraw certain Scottish services so that the following could bepublished together in November:Dumfries-KirkcudbrightInverness-Wick /ThursoInverness-Kyle of LochalshAyr-StranraerDumfries-StranraerThe Scottish T.U.C.C. have been unable, however, to arrange to hear objectionsto these proposals &amp;a late February or early March; and considerable intervalsare occurring in other areas between the publication of proposals and the T.U.C.C.hearing. Since there is no advantage in advancing the publication of controversialproposals if the T.U.C.Cs. cannot dispose of them, my Committee have concluded that no further requests should be made to the Board for publication dates to be advanced.Proposals to be deferred7. This consideration points, on the contrary, to deferring publication ofsome proposals which might otherwise overload the T.U.C.C. machinery. some members of the Committee have thought that it was undesirable that either theRailways Board or the T.U.C.Cs. should spend time on proposals which clearlycould not be approved. They had in mind, in particular, proposals to discontinuecommuter services, which, in view of the emphasis laid in the Buchanan Reporton Traffic in Towns on the importance of maintaining good public transport, itmight be found necessary to maintain on social grounds even if they ran at a loss.The need for these services will have to be considered in the light of the trafficsurveys now being undertaken in large conurbations. In addition, some lines listedfor closure in Appendix 2 to &quot; Reshaping British Railways &quot; serve areas wherein the next few years industrial or housing development may well increase thedemand for rail passenger services, though the extent of the increase will be limited by the contemporaneous growth in the use of private motor cars.8. The Minister of Transport sees difficulty in asking the Railways Board to defer publication of proposals on these grounds, partly on the general ground thatany extensive interference with the discretion which the Act gives to the board is undesirable, partly because it may not be clear for some time what the futurepattern of travel in the areas in question will be. He would prefer to leave theseproposals to take their course through the statutory procedure and to consider them when they reach him with the relevant financial and other information, whichuntil that point is reached is not available. It may then appear, for example, thatwhile a service will be required in some years&apos; time considerable saving could beeffected by discontinuing it in the meanwhile, and that the right course is to approve the proposal subject to a condition that the track is retained so that a service can be re-introduced if and when development in the area renders itnecessary.9. The Minister of Transport is prepared, however, to ask for the defermentof a small number of proposals the publication of which may be particularlyembarrassing in the light of our policy for regional development or the problem of urban traffic. The Committee have selected eight of these:
CJ)        Liverpool Exchange-Southport Chapel StreetManchester Victoria-Bury-BacupEdinburgh-Hawick-CarlisleManchester Victoria-Bury-Accrington-ColneWrexham-Chester Northgate-New BrightonManchester Piccadilly-Hadfield / GlossupManchester Piccadilly-Romiley-Hayfield/MacclesfieldSt. Pancras-BarkingSubject to the Cabinefs concurrence, it is proposed that the Minister should ask the Chairman of the Railways Board to arrange that these should not be publishedduring the next six months, or thereafter until it appears that the relevant T.U.C.C.can consider objections soon after the expiration of the statutory period of notice.Holiday resorts10. Among the stations which the Railways Board propose to close, 127 serveplaces which may be regarded as holiday resorts. Some of these are very small andothers are part of a cluster of resorts. Few of them receive large numbers of visitorsby rail. A recent study by an official working party has shown that, while the numberof people who take holidays away from home is rising, the proportion travellingto holiday resorts by rail has fallen (from 37 per cent in 1955 to 26 per cent in 1962).As more families acquire cars, any loss of visitors which holiday resorts in generalexperience as a result of the closing of their stations is likely to be compensated bythe increasing numbers arriving by car, and the effect of the closures on hotels andemployment in these places is expected to be negligible in relation to other normalfluctuations in the numbers of visitors they receive. We do not think, therefore, thatholiday resorts need be considered as a special class. Individual proposals which,because of special local circumstances, seem likely to cause difficulty can beconsidered on their merits. Since, however, proposals to close a station shortly before or during the holiday season may do unnecessary harm to local interests,the Railways Board have been asked when they expect to publish proposals relatingto holiday resorts and we shall consider whether it is desirable to suggestpostponement in a limited number of cases.Procedure11. Part of the criticism which falls on the Government in connection withthe closure of rail passenger services arises from misunderstanding of theprocedure. The Railway Board&apos;s proposals are widely attributed to theGovernment, and decisions by the Minister of Transport to reject or modifyproposals are represented as a victory won by the objectors at the Governmentsexpense. There is also criticism of the fact that the T.U.C.Cs. are confined to considering the issue of hardship, and there is no public examination of wider questions such as the possibility of running a threatened service more economically.The procedure could not be changed without legislation, however; and the broaderquestions of management which objectors seek to raise could not usefully be examined by a public enquiry. An independent accountant appointed in August toconsider the most appropriate financial information for the Railways Board tosupply to the T.U.C.Cs. endorsed (in a published report) the Board&apos;s existing practice and commended &quot; the meticulous care&quot; with which the figures werecompiled.12. In these circumstances we see no way of improving the present procedure,but it is important that every available occasion should be taken to remove publicmisunderstanding of its nature.Conclusion13. I would like my colleagues&apos; views on the Committee&apos;s suggestion to seek the postponement of the publication of the proposals listed in paragraph 9 above and to examine proposals relating to holiday resorts on the lines indicated inparagraph 10; and to seek their advice as to whether we should attempt to secure any more drastic rearrangement of the Railways Board&apos;s programme.B.Office of the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, S.W. 1,14th January, 1964.
