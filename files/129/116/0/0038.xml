CP. (64) 38 Copy No.10th February, 1964CABINETEXTENSION OF DIVORCE JURISDICTION TO THE COUNTY COURTSMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorThis question was considered by the Home Affairs Committee on the31st January and while the Committee were generally in favour of my proposal,it was felt that it should be considered by the Cabinet (H.P. (64) 3rd Meeting,Minute 5).2. In 1964-65 legal aid for civil proceedings in England and Wales and for criminal proceedings in the Magistrates&apos; Courts is expected to cost the taxpayerabout  5 - 6 million which is about three times what it cost in 1960-61. The increased cost is due primarily to the extension of the scheme, so that many people who could not previously obtain legal aid can now get it, to its extension to domesticproceedings in the Magistrates&apos; Courts and to the introduction of the legal aidservice.Another factor has been the considerable increase in the cost of litigation andcourt fees.3. As I foresaw this increase in cost, I undertook a review of the whole schemelast year to see whether any economies could be made. Divorce cases, the vast majority of them undefended, are likely to cost the taxpayer well over  3 millionnext year.At my request the Bar Council and the Law Society considered whether any changes should be made. They have made a number of suggestions for effectingeconomies, mostly of a procedural kind, but the total saving from all of them islikely to be quite small.A substantial saving, estimated at over  300,000, could be made if the county courts were given jurisdiction to try undefended cases and possibly short defendedcases as well.4. Such a proposal is not novel and is bound to arouse some controversy.The Gorell Royal Commission in 1912, the Denning Committee on Procedure inMatrimonial Cases in 1946 and the Morton Royal Commission on Marriage andDivorce in 1956 were all in favour of the jurisdiction to try matrimonial cases beingvested in the High Court exclusively. Their reasons were that the importance ofthe questions at issue in divorce cases (affecting as they do the family life and status of the parties to them, the interests of their children and the interest of thecommunity in upholding the sanctity of marriage) made it desirable that they shouldbe determined by the superior courts with the assistance of the Bar. The DenningCommittee argued that if there is a careful and dignified proceeding such as obtainsin the High Court for the undoing of a marriage, then quite unconsciously the people would have a much more respectful view of the marriage tie and the marriagestatus than they would if divorce were effected informally in an inferior court.5. In spite of these arguments, both the Gorell Commission andthe DenningCommittee recommended that County Court Judges should sit as specialcommissioners to try divorce cases, but it was not until the flood tide of divorcehad reached its peak immediately after the last war that this system was introduced.3908IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1964
Since then the County Court Judges both in and outside London have sabJfeCommissioners of the High Court to try undefended and short defended (nwestimated to last more than three hours) divorce cases.In practice the London County Court Judges sitting at the Royal Courts ofJustice try only undefended cases.Nearly 90 per cent of the undefended divorce cases are tried by County court judges sitting as Commissioners: some 8 per cent are tried by Queen&apos;s Counselsitting as Commissioners leaving the Judges of the Divorce Division with less than percent.When sitting as a Commissioner, a County Court Judge has the authority ofa High Court Judge, wears a black robe instead of the robes of a County court judge, and is addressed as &quot; My Lord&quot; instead of &quot; Your Honour&quot;. Notinfrequently he sits as a Divorce Commissioner in the very same court as that inwhich he sits as County Court Judge.6. I very much doubt whether the trial of undefended divorce cases beforeCounty Court Judges sitting as Commissioners has any greater beneficial effect onthe sanctity of marriage.than trial before the same persons sitting as County court judges; indeed it may be doubted whether there really is any substance in the viewof the Denning Committee and the Morton Commission that confining divorcejurisdiction to the High Court has any beneficial effect on the sanctity of marriageor tends to make people take a more respectful view of the marriage tie. The present state of the law has not led to any fall in the divorce rate, which in 1963 was about four times greater than it was immediately before the last war.7. Transfer of undefended and short defended cases to the County court would reduce the legal costs both for those who do and those who do not receive legal aid. The principal reasons for this are that in the County Courtssolicitors have the right of audience and in a substantial number of cases couldbe expected to appear without counsel; the procedure in the County Courtis simpler and cheaper than in the High Court (it being possible to prescribescales of costs for counsel and solicitors). If the County Courts were given thisjurisdiction, such cases could be tried at many more places than they are atpresent and this would lead to a reduction in the costs now incurred in bringing the parties and their witnesses, it may be a considerable distance, to the townswhere divorce is now tried and of keeping them there until the case is heard.8. Trial of such cases in the County Court would be greatly welcomed bythe Law Society. It would be unpopular with the Bar and with most if not all of the Divorce Court Judges. It will be said that the nature of undefendeddivorce cases and the interests at stake are such that the Judges should be ableto rely implicitly on the advocates appearing before them and that this couldnot be done to the same extent if solicitors were given the right of audience.I do not believe that at the present day this argument should be given muchweight. Undefended divorce cases and most short defended divorce cases raiseissues of no greater difficulty than those which solicitors are accustomed tohandling at the present time in other cases in the County Courts as well as inthe Magistrates&apos; Courts, where matrimonial cases often raise issues of considerablecomplexity. Further, in cases of difficulty one would expect solicitors to briefcounsel.9. This proposal may also be attacked on the grounds that it will make it easier to obtain a divorce. This is only true, in my view, in the sense that thecost of undefended divorce and short defended cases will be reduced. I do not propose that there should be any transfer to the County Court Judges of workwhich they do not already do as Commissioners. It is really rather farcical thatthe taxpayer should have to pay at least  300,000 a year because the county court Judge trying these cases wears a different robe and is addressed as &quot; MyLord &quot;.10. It would be possible to transfer only the undefended and not the shortdefended cases to the County Court. The additional saving in the cost of legal aid if short defended cases were transferred would not be very great, and theproposal to transfer short defended cases would be more controversial.But unless the County Court Judges are to be deprived of their presentpower to try short defended cases when sitting as Commissioners (which I should
lleprecate) there would,be obvious objections to undefended cases being triedWy a County Court Judge sitting as such and short defended cases being triedin his capacity as Commissioner of the High Court. It would, for instance, beabsurd for the Judge to have to change his robes after he had disposed of ashort defended case before dealing with the list of undefended cases. , .11. I contemplate that a case would, as now, be begun in the High court and would be transferred to the County Court when the time came to set it down for trial or, at the discretion of the Court, if it became undefended at some later date, and that a short defended case would be transferred when it becamepossible to estimate the length of the trial. There may be some administrative problems to be worked out, but none are, I think, insuperable.12. It is not without interest that Lord Gardiner in his book &quot;law reform Now &quot; (at p. 15) recommends this transfer of jurisdiction in respect ofundefended divorce cases to the County Court. In my view he is right in doing so. It would not be right merely to base the case for the change on the prospectivesaving to the taxpayer.13. When the Public Accounts Committee were questioning the permanent secretary of my office on Legal Aid Costs he indicated that transfer of thisjurisdiction to the County Court would lead to a substantial saving of expense andwas being considered.Questions have been tabled to find out what decision has been reached onthis and it is therefore necessary for a decision to be taken without delay.14. An alteration in jurisdiction of the kind suggested will focus attentionon the fact that since 1946 Commissioners who are Q.C.&apos;s have been trying Divorce,cases. They are remunerated by fees, have no security of tenure, and are notpensionable. They are men of considerable seniority but who have failed to beappointed to either the High Court or County Court Bench. The practice of appointing such Commissioners is inherently unsatisfactory and has been thesubject of repeated criticism.The Morton Commission recommended that these Commissioners should bereplaced by Judges. Many representations have been received from the Bar Counciland the Law Society to the same effect and we have announced in Parliament our intention of getting rid of the Commissioner system (House of Commons Debates,11th November, 1960, Col. 1395).15. Despite the increase in the judicial strength of the Divorce Division from10 Judges in 1960 to 13 Judges in 1964, the increase of divorce business has made it necessary to employ two Silk Commissioners (and until recently, three)permanently in London and two or three Silk Commissioners fairly regularly inthe Provinces. In 1962 Commissioners had to be employed on 794 days and in1963 on 969 days.16. I consider that the present position is not defensible and is contrary tothe public interest. Litigants on such important matters as divorce are entitled to expect that their cases will be tried by Judges. The President of the Probate, Divorceand Admiralty Division has made the strongest representations to me on this matter.He thinks that if he can be given two more permanent Judges, he may be able to dispense with Commissioners almost entirely, provided that jurisdiction inundefended and short defended cases is given to the County Court.The cost to public funds of two more Judges will be largely offset by the saving on Commissioners&apos; fees and expenses.17. I have not asked before now for authority for the appointment of moreDivorce Court Judges but I am satisfied that action must be taken to do so as soonas possible. It is becoming increasingly difficult to find competent Q.C.&apos;s willingto act. It is really unfair to ask a busy Silk to forgo a substantial part of his income to sit as a Commissioner and it is not easy to find suitable Commissioners from the ranks of the Silks who have not been successful.18.   To sum up, I would like to secure:(a) the transfer of jurisdiction to try undefended and short defended divorcecases to the County Court;(b) authority for the appointment of two more High Court Judges, which would bring the total number of High Court Judges to 57 (assuming two moreJudges are authorised to deal with resale price maintenance).
19.  Legislation would be necessary. I am advised that the necessary Bill wouMfebe of three or four clauses. I fully appreciate the difficulty of legislating this SessioWbut I would rather see a Bill introduced and fail to pass all its stages than not make the attempt. I ask my colleagues to agree that the attempt should be made and I apologise for the length of this paper on a somewhat complicated subject.D.Lord Chancellors Office, House of Lords, S.W. 1,6th February, 1964.
