Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 19 Copy No.   6221 st January, 1964CABINETGOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE AFTER 1968Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the chief secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster general as our colleagues are aware, the Government are now faced with the need to make decisions on a number of projects all of which will involve substantialGovernment expenditure at the turn of this decade. It is clearly essential thatwe should not take decisions on them piecemeal. The Plowden Committee report has made it clear enough how piecemeal decisions in the past have led to unwisecommitments.2. We have published our estimate of the cost of our existing commitmentsup to 1967-68 in the recent White Paper. We said that these represented the most that could be afforded even with a 4 per cent growth rate (in itself a boldassumption). No one has disputed this, not even the Opposition.3. The White Paper shows that public expenditure which in 1957-58 took36 per cent of gross national product will by 1967-68 be taking 41^ per cent. the implications of this for taxation levels are clear. Unless there is some remarkableup-surge in savings some of the resources for meeting our existing programme willhave to be found from increasing rates of taxation. The warnings we have givenabout this in the White Paper and in public statements have so far been relativelymild.4. It is to our minds essential that the plain fact be realised that the commitments we have undertaken up to 1967-68 do not cease then; they willcontinue, and they will continue to call for rapidly rising levels of government expenditure. While the programmes have not been precisely costed for the late1960s the following items, which represent the major heads of government expenditure, show clearly the position as it already exists:(a) defence the implications of present weapons policy are that expenditure mayrise very fast in the late 1960s; and of course such projects as the fifthnuclear submarine and participation in the mixed-manned force would pushit up faster still.(b) RoadsInvestment on major roads is rising 12 per cent a year and theprogramme is fixed up to 1968-69. In the light of the Buchanan report and growing regional pressures it seems quite unreal to suppose that the rising curve will then flatten out; indeed there will be continuing pressure to make it even steeper.(c) HousingWe are committed to an ultimate total of 400,000 houses which in itselfwill ensure that the cost of the housing programme will be continuing torise after 1968.HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT3801
5. To sum up therefore, the commitments we have already accepted involve a sharp increase in expenditure not only up to 1967-68 but for several years beyond.While it is true that the figures have been published only up to 1967-68 the sheermomentum of our programmes will continue long afterwards. These existing commitments are already such as to be regarded by responsible opinion as themaximum that the economy can reasonably carry; indeed many would go further and say that they were already excessive. The prospects of any useful tax reductionsover the next few years are slight, and there is a real danger that we shall not be ableto finance our programmes without substantial tax increases.6. It is against this background that we must consider such items as theChannel Tunnel, decimalisation, raising the school leaving age and the additional demands for the University Grants Committee over and above the previous estimates of the cost of Robbins. We think it is manifest from the facts stated above that itwould be entirely wrong to add these new proposals to our existing programme. If asa Government we are able to to accept all or any of them then something else mustbe cut back to make room.Channel Tunnel7. The argument is set out in CP. (64) 20. If work begins in 1964-65 mostof the expenditure will fall in the two years 1968-69 (about  30-35 million,including extra roads) and 1969-70 (about  25-30 million).Decimalisation8. This issue is summarised in CP. (64) 18. The estimated cost is  109 million(partly private and partly public, but all a charge on national resources) spreadover five years but heavily concentrated in the third and fourth years. If D-day wasin February 1967, the heavy expenditure would be in 1966-67 and 1967-68  55 million and  35 million respectively.(d) education the cost of education is rising very rapidly, and, quite apart from thenew proposals mentioned below, the existing programme, including theestimate of the cost of Robbins allowed for in the public expenditure white paper, means that without further commitment the total cost will still berising steadily at the turn of the decade.(e) Health .At the moment the annual rate of increase in current expenditure is held to 2\ per cent in real terms. This looks modest in comparison with, e.g.,education, and we certainly cannot expect any reduction; indeed there maybe pressure for further increases.(/) Benefits and assistance we are committed to ensuring that beneficiaries continue to share in the rising prosperity of the country. The minimum interpretation of this is thatpensions should go up in step with wages and salaries. In the past of coursewe have increased them substantially faster. To do this throughout the 1960swould lead to a formidably higher total than we are now assuming. In addition there is the growing pressure for wage related benefits which could be extremely costly.(g) Nationalised Industry investment the electricity programme is the dominant factor here. It will be risingstill in the late 1960s.(h) Assistance to Agriculture, Industry and TransportOne big increase in this field looks like being the Concord, the cost ofwhich has already risen from  150-170 million to over  200 million and willbe at its peak at the end of the 1960s. As some off-set to this and otherincreases of expenditure we hope to get savings on the railways. We havealready counted on a good deal of this in our calculations.
hool Leaving Age9. The facts are set out in CP. (64) 21. If the age is raised in 1971 or 1972,the cost in the late 1960s would be predominantly the extra capital cost. In the longerview, there would be extra current expenditure of  45 million a year; and a lossof Gross National Product of the order of  150 million a year. The extra capital cost is difficult to ascertain, for much of it could be accommodated within a continuing school building programme of the level now planned for 1966-67 starts;but the extra might be of the order of  10-15 million a year in the late 1960s.Universities10. The University Grants Committee has put forward proposals involvingbuilding starts of the order of  225 million in 1964-67 (present programme 33^ million in each of 1964 and 1965), plus about  100 million for equipment,land and fees. These proposals are very much higher than anything envisaged when we were considering the Robbins Report and about 40 per cent should be regardedas &quot; optional&quot;, i.e., not provided for in the White Paper. The Chief Secretary is considering this with Lord President; and it is a large factor in the situation bothup to 1967-68 and in the early following years (although Robbins involves virtually no increase in student numbers then).Conclusions11. We are not attempting to argue that we have been wrong as a Governmentin accepting a programme of the magnitude to which we are already committed.We agree with our colleagues&apos; assessment of the merits of their various deparmental programmes and we are convinced that all of them are desirable in the national interest. We also consider that it is right for the Government to accept a levelof public expenditure on desirable economic and social projects fully consistent with the ambitious growth assumptions of the National Economic development council 4 per cent target. But we suggest that the limits of prudence and financialprobity have now very definitely been reached and that any further net additionswould be economically unsound and politically unwise. In other words, if we decide now to add any of these new items to our programme, we must also nowdecide to reduce some of the existing programmes by an amount sufficient to cover the probable cost of the new item.R. M.J. A. B.-C.20th January, 1964.
