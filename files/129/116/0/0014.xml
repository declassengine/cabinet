CABINETUNILATERAL TARIFF REDUCTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional development and President of the Board of trade the Economic Policy Committee recently asked me (E.P. (63) 11th MeetingConclusions, Minute 3) to circulate a paper examining the contribution whichmight be made to stability of prices by the reduction or suspension of tariffs.2. As this subject is relevant to the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ paper onEconomic Prospects for 1964 (CP. (64) 3), I am, with his agreement, circulatingthis paper direct to Cabinet.3. The subject of unilateral tariff reductions has been given much thought inrecent years. At first blush there seems clear scope for influencing prices in thisway. A good deal of our industrial tariff is high, many rates, e.g., 25 per cent forcars, 33-^- per cent for numerous chemicals, exceeding a reasonable level ofprotection for efficient modern industries. Some of these rates could clearly comedown; and there would certainly be some downward pressure on prices.4. A reduction of tariffs imposed by the Government for general economic reasons would, however, have to cover a wide range of industrial goods if it wereto be accepted as fair; and it would have to be wide-ranging if it were to have any significant effect on the allocation of resources in the economy. A selective decreasemight have some effect as a warning signal on prices, but would not be accepted as fair by the industries who were the victims. I would except from this general statement such reductions as it might be desirable to make as a result of adversereports on individual industries and firms by the Monopolies Commission.5. A tariff reduction might also be a suitable weapon against a sector ofindustry that had been convicted by the National Incomes Commission of grantingan excessive wage increase, though it would have the disadvantage of being punitiverather than preventative and have the effect on a large exporting industry, whichwas selling abroad on very narrow margins, of weakening its position in the moreprofitable home market so much that it might no longer be able to afford to export.Any such action could clearly not be contemplated against the engineering industryuntil the Commission had reported. Tariff reductions would be of no avail againstindustries which are not subject to foreign competition, e.g., the railways.6. Selective reductions in the highest range of the tariff might be a salutaryindication to industry as a whole of the Governmenfs intention to keep prices down;but the choice of victims would be very invidious and the risk of damage to exportsconsiderable. This would apply particularly to motor cars at the present time.7. The basic problem raised by a unilateral reduction of the industrial tariffas a whole is the risk that the benefit of pressure on prices might be outweighed byan immediate and sharp increase of imports which would throw extra strain on thebalance of payments at a time when inflation was already threatening it. We arenow entering a phase in which the balance of payments is likely to weaken. The risk is clear and the benefits uncertain. A better moment for considering such a movewould be when our balance of payments is strong and expected to improve.3748THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majestys GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 14 - Copy No.   g210th January, 1964
Board of Trade, S.W.1,10th January, 1964.(8. Our situation is very different from that in which the Federal German&quot;Republic reduced tariffs some years ago. Between April 1955 and August 1957 theGermans made four unilateral reductions in their industrial tariff. This was a period when Germany&apos;s increasingly strong creditor position in the European payments union had led to a recommendation by O.E.E.C. and pressure in the international monetary Fund that she should stimulate imports as a means of reducing a paymentsdisequilibrium. At the same time the inflationary effect of Germany&apos;s vast exportsurplus was itself a principal source of pressure for higher wages. The German tariffmeasures were thus a deliberate attempt to increase imports in order to right thebalance of payments and bring about some measure of disinflation.9. The selective tariff reductions which the French made last year, thoughcertainly intended to put pressure on prices, took place in conditions of very amplegold and currency reserves and a strong current balance of trade and payments. our situation is very different; the problem which faces us is how to prevent an undueweakening of our reserves in the next two years.10. The other principal difficulty which I see in a unilateral tariff reductionat the present time is in connection with the Kennedy Round. If the reductionswere made by way of suspension of tariffs, we should technically be in a positionto restore the cuts at any time and our bargaining position in the kennedy round would thus in theory be preserved. It would however be unrealistic to expect that other countries would attach as much weight to our arguments in international negotiations for tariff reductions if we had previously shown our willingness to make reductions without receiving any return from other countries for the benefits which we had thereby conferred upon them. This argument wouldnot apply with such force if no international negotiations were impending butthe Kennedy Round is now less than six months away (assuming that it beginson time) and we should certainly weaken our bargaining position if we madeaiiy changes in our tariff now.1.1. I do not suggest that we should abandon any idea of making unilateralreductions, either on the whole of our industrial tariff or on some more selectivebasis, and I intend to keep the matter in the forefront of my mind. I am not convinced however that the present would be a good time to make such reductions,for two main reasons:(i) we might harm the balance of payments at a time when it is enteringa phase of weakness.(ii) we should damage our bargaining position in the Kennedy Round.E.
