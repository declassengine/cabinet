^ secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP. (64) 27 Copy No.     3829th January, 1964CABINETSALARIES OF CHAIRMEN AND MEMBERS OF BOARDS of nationalised industries memorandum by &quot;the Chancellor of the exchequer this paper sets out the proposals of the Wages Committee for increases inthe salaried of Chairmen, Deputy Chairmen and Members of Boards of nationalised industries.background. For some time there has been pressure for improved salaries for the boards of nationalised industries. The salaries were last revised in 1957. an interdepartmental Working Party of officials was set up in the spring of 1963 toconsider what changes might be called for. The Working Party recommended anearly general increase in Board salaries. They found that, since the last review, the pay structure within nationalised industries was becoming distorted because therewas not enough room for senior executive salaries within the limit set by existingBoard salaries, with growing risks of difficulty in recruiting new staff of the rightcalibre and of losing some of their best men to private industry. As regards the salaries of Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen, the Working Party thought thatconsiderably higher salaries were justified by the need to obtain first-classcommercial management in the nationalised industries, the exceptional responsibilityfalling on the individuals concerned, and the need for more room if the distortionof the career structure at lower levels was to be avoided.3. The recommendations of the Working Party were considered by theEconomic Steering (Incomes) Committee, who endorsed the case for a general increase, though with some modifications of the amounts recommended by theWorking Party. The Wages Committee, after preliminary consideration last autumn and further study of particular points by the Working Party, recommend increasesas set out in the following paragraphs.Proposed Increases4. The increased salaries for Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen which theWages Committee recommend, compared with existing salaries, are set out in thefollowing table:Present Proposed. Salaries New Salaries   Chairmen of National Coal Board, British Railways,Electricity Council and the Central electricity generating Board*...............Deputy Chairmen of National Coal Board, british railways, Electricity Council       .........Chairmen of other major Boards    .........Deputy Chairmen of other major Boards    ......* Until there is a change in the present occupancy of the Chairmanship when the salary shouldbe the same as that of the &quot; other major Boards &quot;.10,000	12,5008,000	10,000(one at 7,500)	8,500	11,0007,500	9,500(one at 7,000)	3851
:; - 5; - At present differences in salaries for full-time members of different Boardsreflect assumed differences of status and responsibility between Boards. They varybetween  6,000 and  7,500. In order to meet the need for a more flexible system under which salaries would be more closely related to individual responsibility and ability, the Wages Committee propose that salaries should be determined for individual Board members within a fixed salary band. The range of the band agreed by the Committee is  7,000 to  9,000.6. The changes proposed in paragraphs 4 and 5 amount to a general orderof increase of rather less than 25 per cent which, over a period of six and a half years, is equivalent to annual increases each year of 3^ per cent.7. No specific recommendations have been made for the salaries of the Boardof the Atomic Energy Authority. Changes in the Authority&apos;s salaries, which wouldbe determined in the light of decisions on the nationalised industries, would need to be announced at the same time as any announcement about the other Boards.Publication8. At present all salaries are published in an annual White Paper, but thisis. not a statutory requirement. There is, however, a statutory requirement thatcertain salaries should be shown in statements laid before Parliament as and whennew appointments are made. The position varies from Board to Board. The wages committee have considered whether present practice should be altered in order tobring the nationalised industries more into line with private industry, by notpublishing in the White Paper the salaries fixed for individual Board memberswithin a known range. The Committee&apos;s conclusion is, however that the existing practice with regard to publication of salaries should be maintained.9. The proposals involve one alteration to practice in relation to the salaries of full-time Board members. If the proposal in paragraph 5 for a salary band for full-time Members were adopted, the Committee envisage that only the banditself would be announced at the time of the general announcement of increasedsalaries, but it would be necessary to disclose individual salaries subsequently toParliament, as and when they were determined by Ministers, and where requiredto do so by statute. Comprehensive details would be published in the annual white paper at the end of the year.10. If the increases proposed are approved they must be announced as soonas any necessary consultations on the application of the proposals ban becompleted. The Committee consider that the timing of the announcement shouldbe supervised by the Minister without Portfolio, and arrangements have beenmade to supply him with information which might help him in the presentation;for instance, on the trend in recruitment to the Boards from inside and outsidethe industries.Conclusion11. I seek the approval of the Cabinet to an announcement as soon aspossible of the salary increases proposed in paragraphs 4 and 5.TimingR. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.28th January, 1964.
