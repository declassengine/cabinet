INTRODUCTIONWe were appointed by the Prime Minister:&quot; To review the purpose, structure and operation of the servicesresponsible for representing the interests of the United KingdomGovernment overseas, both in Commonwealth and in foreigncountries; and to make recommendations, having regard to changesin political, social and economic circumstances in this country and overseas &quot;.We held our first meeting on July 30, 1962, and since then have heldthirty-three meetings in full Committee. In addition, we set upSub-Committees on &quot; Structure&quot;, &quot; Conditions of Service&quot; and&quot; Communications&quot;. Between them these Sub-Committees heldtwenty-two meetings.We received written and oral evidence from a wide range of individuals and organisations. A list is given at Annex A. We wish to record our thanks to all those who prepared evidence for us and took part in our discussions.We felt it right to see for ourselves something of the work andconditions of service of members of the overseas representational services.We therefore visited departments of the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices and arranged a series of visits to posts abroad. For thepurpose of the visits overseas, we split into groups, usually of two;this enabled us to cover a wide range of posts in the time available to us.A list of the forty-two posts visited is given at Annex B. These visitsallowed us to talk on the spot not only to Ambassadors, high commissioners, Consuls-General and their staffs but to distinguishedcitizens of and British residents in the countries visited.It was in the nature of our task that we should require muchevidence from officials; indeed we took formal evidence from no fewer than seventy-five officials representing over a dozen different departments. Throughout we were in almost daily touch with membersof the Departments most directly concerned: the commonwealth relations Office, the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade and theTreasury. We should like to acknowledge the help and co-operationwe received in fullest measure from them.
We owe a great debt to our Secretaries, Mr. D. C. Tebbit of theForeign Office and Mr. J. A. Annand of the Treasury, whose wideknowledge of the Foreign and Home Civil Services was of the greatesthelp in clarifying the issues before us. The main burden of preparingour report has fallen on them. Without their patience and wise counselour task would have been immeasurably more difficult. We are most grateful to them.We also wish to thank Miss V. King and Miss J. Clarke of theForeign Office and Mrs. J. Haglund and Mrs. M. Blackman of theTreasury, who have provided most efficient secretarial assistance.The passages printed in italics in the text and annexes are those which the Committeewould wish to see omitted from any published version of the report
CHAPTER ONETHE CONDUCT OF COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS AND FOREIGNPOLICYThe Case for review the British representational services overseas have been shaped by manyyears, and in some cases centuries, of organic development and consciousplanning. For practical purposes, however, any detailed review of their present structure and effectiveness must begin with the series of reforms thought out andprogressively introduced during and shortly after the Second World War.2. The Foreign Service, as we know it today, was formally established asa separate Service of the Crown in 1943. The staff of the Foreign Office inLondon and the staff of the Diplomatic Service abroad had been amalgamatedin 1919 and 1920 in accordance with a recommendation of the Royal Commissionof 1911-1914. Within the Consular Service, the process of amalgamation camesomewhat later, but by the end of 1935 the General, Levant, Japan, Siam and china branches had all been amalgamated as far as new entrants were concerned.Finally, the Foreign Service Order in Council of 1943 brought together into one service the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service, the Consular Service and theCommercial Diplomatic Service, thus fulfilling the main intention of the white paper (Cmd. 6420) of that year. The Commercial Diplomatic Service had been,throughout the inter-war period, the responsibility of the Department of OverseasTrade, set up in 1917. Its members served in foreign countries and were thuscomplementary to the Trade Commissioners who had first been appointed to serve in the Dominions in 1908. The Department of Overseas Trade appointedCommercial Diplomatic Officers and issued instructions to them in the nameof the Foreign Secretary; the Department, however, dealt with TradeCommissioners in the name of the President of the Board of Trade.3. The present Commonwealth Service has its origin in the amalgamationin 1947, under the title of Commonwealth Relations Office, of the formerDominions Office and India Office. From 1928 onwards officers of the dominions office had been posted to Missions in the then Dominions; but with few exceptionsofficers in the India Office were not called upon to serve in India. Theadministration of the sub-continent was the responsibility of the Indian CivilService. The staff of the Commonwealth Service have remained members of theHome Civil Service but the nature of their work has in practice led to theirbecoming members of a Service more akin to the Foreign Service than to theHome Civil Service.4. The present Trade Commission Service operates in commonwealth countries only. It came into being in 1946 when the Department of Overseas Tradewas absorbed by the Board of Trade. Commercial representation in foreigncountries had become an integral part of the Foreign Service; responsibility forstaffing Trade Commission posts in Commonwealth countries, however, was assumed by the Board of Trade. The Trade Commission Service has no careerstructure of its own but is composed of volunteers from the staff of the Board ofTrade. Some go abroad for one appointment only but others spend the greaterpart of their careers abroad.5. The Foreign and Commonwealth Services and the Trade CommissionService have thus been in existence in their present form for periods of up to twenty years. In considering them and their suitability for the tasks they are likelyto have to undertake in the future, we have had to bear in mind that the changes made in the past twenty years in recruitment, training and structure may notyet have had time to make their full impact. However, recruits of the early post-war years now dominate the middle ranks of all three Services and are beginning to find their way into some of the most senior posts. Thus by now the post-war reconstruction can be seen in sufficient perspective to enable a judgment to be formed of its consequences, good and bad. Part of our mandate was therefore toexamine the three Services critically in the light of two decades of experience.
6. The world in which the overseas Services now have to operate is nolonger the world of 1943 or even a world which could be foreseen in 1943. Theinternational scene has greatly changed and Britain&apos;s position in the world hasaltered. We therefore begin our report with an attempt to assess the consequences for our overseas Services of the changes in the national and international scenewhich have occurred in the last twenty years or so and those further changes which can reasonably be expected.Britain&apos;s representational needs in a changing world7. There has been an undeniable change in the balance as well as in thenature of military power throughout the world. The United States and the soviet union have grown more powerful, both in absolute terms and in relation to other major powers. In relative terms, the military strength of Britain, as well as that ofother European countries, has declined. This must not, however, be overstated; ina thermonuclear age even the giant powers are inhibited from making other thancautious and circumscribed use of their military potential. On the other hand, while accepting the strength of our own nuclear potential, we must recognise the effecton Britain&apos;s power of her relinquishment of control in many strategic areas of theworld since 1945. No longer, for example, can we deploy the military and strategicresources, such as the Indian Army, with which we once effectively controlled thewhole area astride the trade route from Malta to the Far East and Australia.8. There have been comparable changes in relative economic power. our economic resources as a whole are now less adequate than once they were to serve as a lever for exerting influence or pressure overseas. In part this is the consequenceof a considered policy of leading dependencies to independence: we have accepted that we no longer have within our control the economic resources of a world-wideempire.9, There are, however, other measurements than those of physical strengthalone. Britain retains many wide responsibilities and a high degree of world-wideinfluence. We believe that the British people wish to sustain that influence andshare Sir Winston churchill&apos;s view that Britain should not be content to be&quot; relegated to a tame and minor role in the world &quot;. If our influence is not felt,not only national but international interests and objectives will suffer. It is in thegeneral interest that Britain&apos;s voice should continue to be heard and to carryweight in the world. If this is to.be achieved, despite the narrower limits of our economic and military resources, we shall require to make the best possible useof &quot; diplomacy &quot; and &quot; persuasion &quot;. What we can no longer ensure by poweralone, we must secure by other means. In this, our &quot; diplomatic &quot; Services havean indispensable part to play. The strength and quality of their performance mustbe fully maintained.10. A second and related change is that the problem of earning our living in the world has become more difficult. It is now a major preoccupation whichinfluences all our international actions and attitudes. An alert and efficientdiplomacy can exercise an influence disproportionate to physical strength but itcannot operate effectively on the basis of prolonged economic weakness. Thestrength of our diplomacy depends on and must be related to our economic strength. The survival of Britain, let alone her influence, depends on trade. Thework of our representatives overseas must be increasingly dedicated to the supportof British trade. Economic and political motives intertwine throughout our foreignpolicy and have always done so; but economic and commercial work has nowassumed a position of fundamental importance. It must be regarded as a first charge on the resources of the overseas Services.11. Third, we are no longer concerned only with our relations with a fewGreat Powers. Since 1945, no fewer than fifty new independent States have comeinto being, many of them as a result of our own policies. Their emergence hasplaced an additional burden on both the Foreign and Commonwealth Services.New overseas Missions have had to be opened, often in remote places with tryingclimates, unpleasant living conditions and difficult political situations. Thespectacular growth in the number of independent countries has almost doubled thenumber of capitals where Britain is now represented. At present Britain maintainsresident representation in 106 countries; the Foreign Office in 90, theCommonwealth Relations Office in 16. There is non-resident representation in
12 other foreign countries; only in 10 of the 128 independent countries of the worldis there no British representation of any kind. Annex C gives a list of theindependent countries of the world and shows the extent of British representation.12. These new commitments have stretched the manpower resources of the overseas Services both quantitatively and qualitatively. There have not been enoughpeople to go round. Officers have had to go short of leave and training. Many ofthe new posts have been of a kind to require special resources of character,personality and technical proficiency. The range of tasks has also been increased.For humanitarian as well as political and economic reasons, we have played our part in helping new independent countries to achieve the rapid social, economicand political progress they desire. The countries of the world are becoming moreinterdependent, though they do not always recognise it. The need to reconcileindependence with interdependence has added another dimension to the work ofdiplomacy.13. Fourth, there has been a major change in the nature of theCommonwealth. Before the war, the relationship of Britain to other commonwealth countries was still largely a maternal one in the sense that BritishAmbassadors in foreign countries normally looked after the interests of theDominions as well. Only Canada then had a separate Foreign Service of any size.Commonwealth countries habitually looked first to Britain in all circumstances,irrespective of their geographical position. This is no longer true. The &quot; OldDominions &quot; are now deeply involved in political and military relationships intheir own parts of the world and have their own regional interests to safeguard.Australia, for example, has to concern herself with what goes on in the wholePacific area and has established extensive diplomatic and trade links of her own.This does not mean that everything has changed or that nothing of the oldexclusive relationship has survived or can survive. Far from it. But it does mean that new interests have come in as well and made the relationship more complicated. The&quot; Old Dominions &quot; will pursue their own regional objectives, although they willcontinue to be influenced by their close ties of culture and sentiment with Britain,by the still wide areas of common interest, including trade, and by the habit ofintimate conversation. Although there are wide areas of common interest with thenew Commonwealth countries, our link with them is of a different character. like other newly independent countries, these Commonwealth countries have an acutelydeveloped sense of national consciousness and are anxious to develop links with countries other than Britain. We cannot expect to have the same intimacy with them as we have with the &quot; Old Dominions&quot;, with whom there has always been an&quot; easiness of understanding &quot; irrespective of the points of view held.14. The continued Commonwealth link remains a bridge between thecontinents of the world. Nothing should be done to weaken it. We should continueto cultivate relations with Commonwealth countries on as deep a level as possible and to take the fullest advantage of the key provided for us by the widespreaduse of the English language. But our diplomacy must recognise the maturity of commonwealth countries and their determination to play their part as individuals in regional and world affairs.15. Fifth, there has been a marked trend towards multilateralism;international organisations have proliferated. This trend is likely to continue.International organisations, including the specialised agencies of the united nations and regional, economic and defence pacts, will continue to developas the international family gradually approaches a one-world concept. To maintain our influence, therefore, we shall need to work increasingly through the united nations, through our alliances and through multilateral agencies. We must giveour representatives the flexibility, training and resources which will enable themto come fully to terms with this situation.16. The growth of international organisations has given rise to additional work, both in British Missions at the headquarters of the organisations and inLondon, without diminishing the amount of work which has to be undertakenbilaterally in the capitals of the other members. The trend towards multilateralismhas also had implications for the whole of Whitehall. As matters affecting trade,military and financial policy and aid are increasingly handled multilaterallythrough international agencies, a significant proportion of the members of theBritish delegations to these bodies have been drawn from the Home Civil Service,CONFIDENTIAL3610 B
including the Service Departments, and the Armed Forces. For administrators ofdifferent countries to get together to discuss common policies is a fruitful way of developing international relations. It is important for relations between the overseas Services and the Home Civil Service to be close and cordial and forexchanges of staff between the overseas Services and the rest of Whitehall to be facilitated.17. A sixth change has been the growth of Communism as a world force.This has led to the intensification of a struggle for world domination, with apolarisation of power blocs around the United States and the U.S.S.R. The free world has had to keep itself free and, in this, diplomacy has played its part to thefull. The spread of Communism has put upon our representational services a newrange of activities and problems on a world scale. Experts in Communist theoriesand methods have been needed in greater numbers. Much attention has had to be concentrated on detecting and countering Communist non-military offensives andsubversion. Emphasis on security and security procedures has had to be on atotally new scale and this has created many administrative problems for the overseas Services as well as subjecting members of the staff and their families to greater personal strains. For the same reason, the use of locally-engaged staff hashad to be restricted although the effects in terms of efficiency and expense havebeen unwelcome. Most important of all has been the consequence that manyinternational problems, which of themselves might have been relativelystraightforward, have acquired an ideological content. This has greatly complicatedthe handling of our overseas relations.18. This situation will not, however, stand still. We must expect changes inthe aspect and nature of Communism, in relationships between individualCommunist countries and in our relationships with them. Changes of this kindare already evident. Many of those who call themselves Communists today havedifferent ideas from those who professed Communism fifteen or twenty years ago.No doubt fifteen years hence the ideas and attitudes of many Communists willhave undergone further changes. Some may move closer to western ideas and itmust be an objective of our diplomacy to seize any opportunities which flow fromthis. On the other hand, changing relationships between Communist countries may well constitute dangers rivalling those which arose from &quot; East-West&quot;tensions. Here again the need for an alert and well-informed diplomacy is evident.The overseas Services must have insight into contemporary ideological questions and be equipped to cope with struggles of an ideological nature.19. A seventh change is the growth of extreme forms of nationalism incertain areas of the world. This, in its cruder manifestations, can pose problems which rival those created by Communism in the days when the Cold War was at its most intense. The most serious problems stemming from extreme nationalistpolicies and attitudes in other countries may yet have to be encountered. It doesnot follow that, because most territories of the world have now become independent, the dangers arising from extreme nationalism and anti-colonialistmemories are likely to subside quickly. In recent years, racialism has committedsome of its worst excesses in countries which achieved their independence someyears ago. Iraq and Indonesia are cases in point. We cannot assume that suchmanifestations have run their course or even reached their peak. Violence, whethergenerated by anti-colonialist feeling or motivated by more primitive desires, may still be a problem for our diplomacy for some years to come. Violent nationalismof this sort not only creates obstacles to British policy but brings british representatives and their families into positions of personal stress and danger.20. Major developments in science and technology constitute an eighthchange in the international scene. These have had and will have an appreciableinfluence on our foreign policy. In the field of disarmament, for example, the impact of scientific developments will continue to be of vital interest. There havebeen revolutionary improvements in communications. Ministers and officials cantravel quickly from one country to another. Instructions can be secured by telegram or telephone in a matter of hours or minutes. Improved communicationsthus tend to limit the independent authority of the man on the spot. But, althoughthe frequency with which Ministers now travel abroad may take away some ofthe prestige of the role of an Ambassador, there are many posts throughout theworld which Ministers have to visit only rarely. In any case, these visits do not reduce the need for an Ambassador or the burden and importance of his work.
Tasks, Priorities and Costs24. Our need for efficient overseas representational services is likely toincrease rather than decrease. The tasks of those services are growing wider in scope and becoming more complex and exacting.25. The nature of the work is not always readily understood by the general public. The range of business transacted between governments is so wide andvaried that the man in the street has often no clear or accurate image of it. much is conducted in secret. Successes are seldom heard of, for quarrels averted orresolved do not often make news. But the failures of diplomacy are trumpetedabroad. Moreover, criticism of failure is often misdirected: even the most skilleddiplomatist will meet with failure when the other side lacks the willingness toreach an acceptable solution. One cannot negotiate successfully with intransigence;and independent countries have every right to withhold co-operation if they wish.26. Another barrier to understanding is that of terminology. The word&quot; representation&quot; is suspect. We have been obliged to use the term&quot; representational&quot; to distinguish the Foreign Service, the Commonwealth Serviceand the Trade Commission Service collectively from H.M. Oversea Civil Service(formerly known as the Colonial Service), on the one hand, and from the armed forces on the other. But we are conscious that, to many people, &quot; representation &quot;suggests, though wrongly, little more than a round of cocktail parties andattendances at formal gatherings of little practical consequence. We want to makeit clear that by a representational service we mean a civilian service whose dutyit is to make known and to defend British interests by diplomatic as opposed to military or other means. The interests which have to be represented, promoted ordefended are substantial and vital. No one can doubt the prime importance of safeguarding peace throughout the world. The promotion of British trade is equallyessential to us. In both of these our representational Services have an indispensablepart to play. When the tasks of the overseas Services are expressed in examples of this kind their immediacy and relevance is not likely to be challenged. The mainconcern will be rather to ensure that the Services are staffed and equipped on thescale necessary to carry out such duties with the greatest possible skill, integrity and diligence.3610(The necessity for him to be in touch with local personalities and sources ofinformed opinion is all the greater because reliable advice is required from himmuch more quickly and on a vastly increased range of subjects. An Ambassadormay still have to make rapid decisions without instructions. The tempo of foreignaffairs has quickened as the sphere of governmental activity has widened.International problems not only interact upon each other but do so with increasingrapidity.21 The revolution in communications has also made it possible for many more members of the public to travel abroad. Businessmen and holidaymakersnow travel overseas in unprecedented numbers, bringing with them much new workfor commercial and consular staffs.22. A ninth change is that foreign policy has a greatly increased publiccontent. Foreign affairs are no longer concerned almost exclusively with relationsbetween governments. The impact of policies upon public opinion at home andabroad has increasingly to be taken into account. Broadcasting and television, aswell as foreign travel, have made their contribution. The appeal to peoples as opposed to governments has added a new element to diplomacy. Information and cultural activities are now a regular part of the work of the overseas Servicesand occupy the undivided attention of a sizeable number of the staff. All membersof the overseas Services need to see international problems in greater depth andto consider their implications not only for governments but for groups and interests which will influence governments.23. Finally, those who represent Britain overseas must be truly representative.They should, therefore, reflect the widening of educational and social oppertuinities which has occurred in recent years. This has important implications in the fields of recruitment, training and conditions of service.
27. We see the following as the main tasks on which the three overseas services are engaged:(a) AdviceThis is the function of advising Her Majesty&apos;s Government on everyaspect of foreign policy. For this purpose the Foreign Office,Commonwealth Relations Office, the Board of Trade and otherDepartments in Whitehall must be quickly and comprehensivelyinformed about political and economic developments overseas whichare of significance to us. Reports, by telegram, telephone, despatch andletter, have to be analysed and correlated with other information,including the conclusions of research and long-term planning. Thevolume of reporting has increased year by year. In 1939 for example,the Foreign Office alone received 25,088 telegrams and sent out 18,351;the corresponding figures for 1962 were 75,391 and 155,020. In the sameyears the total volume of correspondence received by the Foreign office was 270,968 and 665,951 respectively. The major increase in correspondence from home and abroad came before 1953; in that yearcorrespondence &quot; in &quot; was 586,289. These figures show clearly howgreat has been the increase in reporting and in sending instructions by telegram. It may be said that the present volume of correspondenceshould be reduced and indeed we make recommendations elsewhere inour report which should lead to some reduction. But this criticism canapply to only a relatively small part of the range of reportingand instructing. It is of interest to note that the slower and more formalmethods of reporting are now less used; in 1939 despatches in and outwere about 35,000; in 1962 the figure was about 14,500.(b) NegotiationIn practice this is the art of trying to persuade other independentpowers to our point of view without effective sanction. It covers a widespectrum of subjects and is to be distinguished from that other function of administration which is the implementation of legislation enacted by Parliament.(c) Cultivation of friendly relations in the widest sense, Ambassadors and High Commissioners andtheir staffs represent the image of Britain abroad. It is therefore their duty to give that impression of Britain and the British people which weshould like foreigners to have and to establish friendly relations at all levels of society and over as wide a range as possible.(d) Trade promotionThis includes assistance to exporters by the provision of market and tariff information, reports and advice on sales opportunities and help in finding agents. In addition, British investors must be helpedand their investments protected. The importance of trade work requires the greatest emphasis.(e) InformationHere the aim is to explain, support and gain acceptance for Britishpolicies.(/) The protection of British persons and interests the many-sided interests of British subjects and communitiesabroad must be fully looked after and supported.(g) Aid and Technical assistance the overseas representational services have recently acquiredduties in connection with the giving of British aid and the administrationof technical assistance abroad. Work in this field is increasing rapidly as aid and technical assistance programmes expand.28. These duties have to be carried out in both foreign and commonwealth countries, not only at Embassies, High Commissions and Consulars posts but inmost instances at the headquarters of international organisations as well. Ourrepresentation at the headquarters of international organisations may take the formof a Mission specially accredited to it, as in the case of the United Kingdom
Delegation to the United Nations, or may be undertaken by the staff of an embassy in the country where the organisation has its seat, as in the case of the food and Agriculture Organisation in Rome. The Commonwealth Service has theadditional and special responsibility for consulting and exchanging views and information with other Commonwealth countries and for encouraging activities,both governmental and non-governmental, which strengthen the Commonwealthlink.29. All these duties are important; some are vital. From the evidence wehave received and the studies we have made both in this country and abroad, weconclude that the present scale of activities of our overseas representationalservices must broadly be maintained. This means that they will need a totaloperational staff of at least the same size as at present: we refer later (para. 88) tothe need for an additional &quot; reserve &quot; of staff.30. The overseas Services should not, however, allow themselves to acceptmore and more duties simply because those duties are desirable in themselves.Some limit must be. set. The existing scale of activity ought not, in aggregate, to be greatly exceeded.31. In no circumstances must work be stinted which can be expected to havea significant bearing on issues affecting war or peace or is in support of trade.Subject to this, there will always be scope for changes in direction and emphasis.Priorities will constantly change, both geographically and functionally. Countriespreviously regarded as political backwaters can become almost overnight areasof critical importance. Countries which were closed to our trade can again becomepromising markets, whilst existing markets can be closed by financial, economic or political changes. At some posts there will be a need to devote the main effort to commercial work at the expense of political, information or consular work.At other posts a quite different order of priorities will be justified. The imperativeneed is for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. Our recommendations aretherefore directed at securing a high degree of alertness to changing circumstances and of administrative flexibility in meeting them.32. We have not ourselves attempted to make detailed recommendations about the work and staffing priorities at individual posts. It was not possiblefor us to visit and make a detailed study of British requirements in every country,let alone every post throughout the world. Even if we had been able to do this,our findings could, in the nature of things, have remained valid only for a short time. In any case, what is needed is not a once for all operation but a recurringprocess of self-criticism and reappraisal for which the overseas Services themselvesmust take responsibility and be equipped. We are not entirely satisfied that thepresent systems of control in the Foreign Service and Commonwealth relations office, excellent and detailed as they are in many ways, are fully able to ensurethat effort is correctly directed towards the most important functions and areas and away from those which are now less important or have ceased to be importantat all. Some periodic overall review procedure is needed to supplement thereports on the staff establishment of each individual Mission which are regularlycompiled by the Inspectors. Departments must decide their priorities in a particular country or area, making it clear what work they want their staffs there to do and what need not be done. This is not to recommend constant chopping and changingon a short-term basis; this is disruptive, uneconomic and bad for morale. On theother hand, changes of a drastic nature and on a considerable scale should not beshirked if long-term trends and priorities justify them.33. There will have to be a mechanism for redirecting effort and resources.The assessment of priorities will not only involve the Administration and the inspectors but will require greater and more effective attention from Ministers and senior officials concerned with policy. It will also require Inspectors of high quality and broad approach. Later (paras. 205-207) we make a specific recommendation which, we think, will go far towards meeting these requirements.34. We have asked ourselves whether there are clear economies of scale which we could recommend now. By far the highest proportion of the expenditureof all three Services is on staffing. Major reductions in expenditure could not therefore be achieved without a comparable reduction in total activity and this we do not think justified. It seems to us, however, that there must be places in theworld where it is not worthwhile to have resident British representation at all.
In future, we should not feel bound to open new Missions simply because furthercountries have become independent. We should only set up new Missions in newlyindependent countries if there are strong reasons for doing so. While, for example,there will be clear reasons for establishing resident representation in Kenya, weshould not on present evidence think there would be sufficient justification for establishing a resident Mission in Chad. Some existing small posts overseas are of minor value to us but we recognise that the withdrawal of representation, once ithas been established, raises problems of pride and of face and may do positiveharm to our interests. &quot; Multiple representation&quot;, whereby an Ambassadorresident in one capital is accredited to several others, is ineffective in some ways and unpopular, but it can be better than having no representation at all. It iscertainly less wasteful than having resident Ambassadors everywhere. We do not recommend the extension of this system but it can be retained and rationalisedwhere we already have it. Occasionally there might be a case for asking a commonwealth country to represent our interests. What we are sure of is that atposts where it is considered necessary to open or maintain a Mission, this must bedone with dignity. Every Mission must be properly housed and equipped.Recently this has not always been the case, especially at newly opened posts. AnEmbassy or Mission which is not well set up and equipped and its staff well housedmay be worse than none at all.35. The cost of maintaining the overseas representational services can be assessed in various ways. In the functional analysis of the 1963/4 Estimates(Cmnd. 1965, Table II) projected expenditure in &quot; Support of External Policy &quot; is divided into &quot; Defence &quot; ( 1,904 million) and &quot; External Relations &quot; ( 220 million).Within the latter figure, which covers Foreign, Commonwealth and Colonialexpenditure,  100 million represents expenditure on aid,  26 million expenditureon Information and  12 million on subscriptions to international organisations. Thecost of administration within this figure is  35 million; this includes that of theForeign Service, the Commonwealth Service and the Trade Commission Serviceof the Board of Trade. Another way of assessing the cost of the overseasrepresentational services is to consider the Estimates for the Foreign and commonwealth Relations Offices in respect of staff and related costs, togetherwith the expenditure undertaken on their behalf by the Ministry of public building and Works, H.M. Stationery Office and the Central Office of Information.On this basis, the estimated cost in 1963/4 of the Foreign Service is  30-5 million and that of the Commonwealth Service  10 million. A breakdown of this expenditure is given at Annex D. Estimated expenditure on the Foreign Servicerepresents 0-87 of a penny out of every pound budgeted for by the Governmentfor 1963/4.36. Proper economy must clearly be exercised in the spending of theseconsiderable sums of money. They are not, however, unreasonable and we do notbelieve that what we require of our overseas Services could be got for less. Thefigure of  40-5 million clearly cannot be invariable. There is no way of laying down an optimum cost and many of the expenses involved, such as those related to the cost of living in countries overseas, are outside our direct control. The realtest is the efficiency of the Services. It is against their continuing efficiency thattheir value in relation to the taxpayer^ money will be judged. Our recommendationsthroughout are therefore aimed at increasing efficiency while keeping additional cost to the minimum.Commonwealth Relations and Foreign Policy37. A unique feature of Britain&apos;s method of handling her external affairs isthat she has one mechanism for dealing with Commonwealth affairs and anotherfor dealing with foreign affairs. This division reflects Britain&apos;s special position asthe centre of the Commonwealth. The weight of the evidence placed before us has emphasised that, quite apart from ties of sentiment and kinship, there are good reasons for maintaining and cherishing the Commonwealth link. This does not mean, however, that we should regard our present administrative arrangementsfor conducting our external affairs as either perfect or immutable. In fact, thepresent system is in many ways inconvenient and at times wasteful and inefficient.38. The Commonwealth Service is at present part of the Home Civil Service.We can see no sense in this arrangement. A career spent in the Commonwealth
Service is, by any yard-stick, a career of overseas service. It would be more logicalto recruit staff for an overseas Service as such rather than to do so through theHome Civil Service as at present. Members of the Commonwealth Service havethe same kind of duties in relation to Commonwealth countries as Foreign service officers have towards foreign countries. These are of a representational character and require conditions of service like those needed in the Foreign Service.39. Most officers of the Commonwealth Service at present do no economic or commercial work. In Commonwealth countries this work is mainly carried out by officers of the Trade Commission Service drawn from the Board of Trade, whereas in foreign countries it is carried out by Foreign Service officers. This arrangementdeprives the great majority of Commonwealth Service officers of the opportunityof acquiring a familiarity with economic and commercial matters which are at thecentre of our relations with any country. If it is right for suitable Foreign service officers to gain this experience, and we are sure that it is, it is right for commonwealth Service officers to have it too.40. A possibility which might be suggested would be to take theCommonwealth Service out of the Home Civil Service and set it up as a separateoverseas Service of the Crown parallel to the Foreign Service and with responsibilities for trade. There are several objections to this. It was stronglyrepresented to us that the Commonwealth Service had expanded so rapidly inrecent years and had been obliged to undertake so many new commitments that itwould be unreasonable to require it to undertake at the present time a range ofnew and important duties of an economic and commercial character. It was alsoput to us that the tendency to advocate the interests of Commonwealth countries,a tendency inherited by the Commonwealth Service from the days whenCommonwealth countries were not themselves fully equipped in the representationalfield, would work to the detriment of Britain&apos;s trade requirements, in which the promotion of purely British interests must take priority. Moreover, we think it right in principle and sound in practice that officers with experience in the BoardOf Trade should continue to play a significant, though not an exclusive, part in economic and commercial work overseas. Finally, if a change is to be made we donot think that a change of the kind suggested would go far enough, as it wouldnot touch other shortcomings of the present system.41. The most serious of these is that the division of the world forrepresentational purposes into Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countriesimpedes the development and execution of a coherent foreign policy. It cuts acrossevery other kind of international grouping and association. Membership of theCommonwealth is only one of the factors which helps to shape the policy of anyCommonwealth country and it is rarely the decisive one.42. We need a system which recognises that individual commonwealth countries have developed regional interests and relationships of their own and cannot regard their relationships with Britain as paramount. The breadth of ourrepresentational requirements with Commonwealth countries is perhaps bestdemonstrated at the United Nations; there members of the Commonwealth expressviews on every sort of international issue, well beyond the range of commonwealth affairs. Most of these issues are the primary concern of the Foreign Office and it isthe Foreign Office which is responsible for our Mission to the United Nations.Again, we cannot consider our attitude to Malaysia without considering at thesame time our relationship with other South-Easi Asian countries and other worldpowers. Australia no longer thinks of her defence policy solely or even primarily in terms of her relations with Britain but in terms of her relations also with theUnited States, Indonesia, China and her Pacific neighbours. Equally, Canada hasto look at least as much to the United States as to the Commonwealth in decidingher attitude to any international question. We cannot work out a coherent foreignpolicy unless we are able to take fully into account the non-Commonwealth interestsof Commonwealth countries and deal with them in their regional or world context.Our present system does not make this easy.43.. The makers of British policy must be in a position to see internationalproblems broadly and to see them whole. At present they are not so placed. Totake one example, the division of responsibility between the Foreign Office andthe Commonwealth Relations Office for our relations with neighbouring countriesin West Africa constitutes a weakness. This division makes it much more difficultto form a coherent picture of the political, economic and other interests of West
Africa as a whole. The fact that our Missions are differently organised, thattheir personnel are drawn from separate Services and that they lack any directmeans of communicating confidentially with each other makes effectiveconsultation and identity of thought between them harder to achieve. We accept that every effort is made in London to harmonise our policies towardsCommonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries. But where this succeeds, itsucceeds in spite of the system and involves much duplication and expenditureof time and effort. With two Ministries, two overseas Services and twocommunications systems, the process of trying to hammer out a sensible world-wide policy is, with the best of goodwill, a wasteful and time-consuming process.At times of crisis these shortcomings can prove disastrous. The division ofresponsibility is becoming an anachronism.44. The logic of events points towards the amalgamation of theCommonwealth Relations Office and the Foreign Office. The unified control and execution of our external policy as a whole which would result would be a rationaland helpful development. This must, in our view, be the ultimate aim. However, totake such a fundamental step now could be misinterpreted as implying a loss ofinterest in the Commonwealth partnership. We therefore hesitate to recommend the establishment of a single Ministry of External Affairs as an opportune stepto take at the present time, although this is the practice in all other commonwealth countries. But we do recommend, as an immediate and urgently needed reform, the creation of a unified Service which will take in the duties,personnel and posts of the Foreign Service, Commonwealth Service and TradeCommission Service. We also propose a combined Administration for the unified service, common recruitment and common conditions of service. The staff of thenew Service, which should hold the same position vis-a-vis the rest of the publicservice as the Foreign Service now has, would be available throughout their careersfor assignment to posts in foreign and Commonwealth countries, the ForeignOffice and the Commonwealth Relations Office.45. Separate Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices would be retained in Whitehall but would draw their staff from the combined Service. This proposalcannot bring with it all the advantages which would flow from a totalamalgamation. However, although the two Departments would retain their separateidentities, they would inevitably under our plan grow closer together in policyand practice; this is desirable in itself and will prove of help and advantage if inthe future a full amalgamation is carried out. The less radical change we wishto see take place at once has solid advantages of its own:(a) There would be one Service engaged in what is fundamentally one job,that of representing and furthering British interests throughout theworld. The same professional skills and personal qualities are requiredin those who handle our relations with either Commonwealth or foreigncountries.(b) The political and economic considerations dominant in determining Britishinterests overseas increasingly cut across the divisions between commonwealth and foreign countries; the broader outlook and experience required can best be cultivated in a unified Service.(c) A unified Service would facilitate a much greater interchange between those with foreign and those with Commonwealth experience. Thiswould lead to an increased awareness of Commonwealth issues in theexecution of our foreign policy as a whole and a greater facility inour handling of foreign policy issues at our posts in commonwealth countries. The end result would be a corps of officers with experienceboth of Commonwealth and foreign affairs.(d) A unified Service could ensure that economic and commercial work inthe Commonwealth was brought into closer relationship with politicalwork. It would be neither desirable nor possible to exclude the TradeCommission Service from the amalgamation. We propose that members of the unified Service should undertake economic and commercial duties in both Commonwealth and foreign countries butthat they should be supplemented by officers from the Board of Trade.Some Board of Trade officers with Trade Commission experience wouldtransfer to the new Service permanently; other officers from the board would be seconded to it for periods of service. Board of Trade officers
3610would thus be available for service not only in Commonwealth countries as at present but throughout the world. We make detailed proposals on how these changes should be brought about later in this report(especially paras. 57-62).(e) A unified Service could make a more rational use of specialist skills;regional specialisation in areas like South-East Asia and West Africawould be facilitated.(/) There would be a broader field of talent and experience upon which todraw. A unified Service would be more flexible and better able toproduce the best man for any given job.(g) There would be wider career prospects for members of the presentServices and new recruits. This should be good for recruitment and morale.(h) A unified Service would make it possible to rationalise work of the samenature. A unified Administration, a single Inspectorate and unifiedsystems of Communications and of training should be set up. the handling of day-to-day problems would be simplified. Functionaloverlapping and duplication of effort would be reduced and someeconomies in staff should result.(/) It would be easier to introduce common conditions of service and commonretirement procedures in the context of a unified Service.(/) Common standards of security, which we believe to be desirable, wouldbe easier to apply.46. We recognise that the existence hitherto of a separate cadre of officers with responsibilities solely in the field of Commonwealth affairs has been a preciseacknowledgement of the special position of the Commonwealth in Britain&apos;srelationships. We do not believe that unification of the Commonwealth and ForeignServices would represent any diminution in the special importance of commonwealth affairs. Moreover, we were told by a number of leadingCommonwealth figures that the change would create no problems for them.Nor are we impressed by the argument that integration would dilute theexperience and special contacts which the members of the Commonwealth Servicehave built up. There is no reason why the special knowledge of commonwealth affairs which has been acquired by the present members of the CommonwealthService should be misapplied in a unified Service. Indeed, the quality of ourrepresentation in both Commonwealth and foreign countries should be enhanced.There is a greater ease of understanding and a greater intimacy in our relationships with many Commonwealth countries than there is in our relations with manyforeign countries; but this intimacy should not be lost under the arrangementswe propose.47. Clearly, there will be administrative problems in the transitional stage.We believe, however, that with care these problems can be overcome withoutinjustice, hardship or loss of efficiency.48. We have also been careful to ensure that the creation of an integratedService should not destroy the contribution which members of the Home CivilService make and can continue to make to the conduct of our overseas affairsboth at home and abroad. There should be no reduction in the extent to which the unified Service calls on the advice and special skills of Home Civil Servants aswell as officers from Service Departments. We believe that secondments from theHome Civil Service are valuable and should be more frequent.49. The Colonial Office and the Department of Technical Co-operationlie outside our terms of reference. We have, however, thought it right to ascertain whether our proposal for a unified Service would be likely to conflict in any way with any arrangements which may be made for the future of those Departments.We have been assured that it will not.50. We believe that steps towards the amalgamation of the Foreign,Commonwealth and Trade Commission Services should be taken immediately.
CHAPTER TWOTOWARDS A NEW DIPLOMATIC SERVICE51. We recommend that the new unified Service should, subject toThe Queen&apos;s approval, be known as &quot; H.M. Diplomatic Service &quot;. This style wouldcommend itself to members of the existing Services and the form &quot; diplomatic service &quot; is already in use in some Commonwealth countries.52. The new name should not imply any narrowing of function. Diplomacyis &quot; the management of international relations by negotiation: the method bywhich these relations are adjusted and managed by ambassadors and envoys &quot;.The new Diplomatic Service will be concerned with international politicalrelationships in the widest sense. It will have trade, aid, consular representationand information amongst its many functions. These are all strands from which thecord of our international relations is woven.The composition of the new Service53. Later (para. 449 et seq.) we set out the conditions of service which, in ourview, should apply to the new Diplomatic Service. In essence, we propose that members of the new Service should be committed in theory and in practice to a career the major part of which will be spent in overseas appointments. Membersof the new Service should also be liable to compulsory premature retirement.In other respects conditions of service should, subject to certain changes and measures of rationalisation we shall recommend, be akin to those by which theForeign and Commonwealth Services are at present governed.54. We have asked ourselves how the creation of the new Service, with theconditions of service we shall propose, will affect the interests of the staffs of thepresent Services. For existing members of the Foreign Service no material change will be involved in the formation of the Diplomatic Service and their incorporation in it. They will, it is true, be more likely than they now are to serve in commonwealth countries. They will also in due course take their places inseniority lists alongside colleagues from the Commonwealth Service and from theBoard of Trade who, owing to different rates of promotion in the different services, may have several years&apos; advantage in seniority. However, althoughseniority will necessarily have to continue to be taken into account in promotionpolicy in the new Service, greater weight must in future be given to merit andsuitability. In particular, no promising member of the new Service, irrespective of his Department of origin, should be penalised by reason of differentials inseniority scales.55. The changes for present members of the Foreign Service are not in ourview sufficiently serious to warrant giving them, as could perhaps be suggested,the right to express an option to join or not to join the Diplomatic Service. we propose therefore that, as from a pre-announced &quot; vesting date &quot; which might be1st January, 1965, the Diplomatic Service should be formally established and all members of H.M. Foreign Service incorporated in it.56. The position of members of the Commonwealth Service is different. Atpresent they are members of the Home Civil Service. Although they are in boththeory and practice liable for overseas service, their expectation is that they willas a rule be required to serve in Commonwealth countries only. As members of a unified Service, they would be expected to serve at any post throughout theworld. There is probably little difference on average between living conditions atposts where members of the Commonwealth Service already serve and at those towhich their sphere of service would be extended. On the other hand, they wouldhave to accept a liability to compulsory premature retirement and this would represent a definite change in terms of service. When the existing Foreign service was formed in 1943, certain Foreign Office employees who were Home CivilServants were given an option to remain Home Civil Servants. We think it wouldbe fair and wise to give existing established members of the Commonwealth3610
Service the right to opt either to join the new Diplomatic Service as full members ior to remain Home Civil Servants with their full existing rights and obligations.All established members of the Commonwealth Service (and members of the TradeCommission Service-see para. 57 below) should be given, about six months before&quot; vesting day &quot;, details of the conditions which will attach to membership of the diplomatic Service; they should then have one year from the &quot; vesting date &quot; inwhich to express an option. Most members of the Commonwealth Service will,we believe, wish to join the new Service as it is likely to be in their career interestsand in accordance with their professional aptitudes to do so. Those who elect notto join would retain an unrestricted liability for service in the commonwealth relations Office and in Commonwealth countries but should be transferred to home departments as opportunity offers over a period of about five years. The special position of members of the Information Class of the Commonwealth Service willbe discussed in the section on Information work (paras. 271-273); we do not propose,however, that they should be granted any form of option beyond that open to allother members of the Commonwealth Service.57. Members of the Trade Commission Service, as officers of the Board ofTrade, are also Home Civil Servants at present. Unlike members of theCommonwealth Service, however, they are not members of an overseas department. It is clear to us that they should not simply be incorporated in thenew Diplomatic Service but should be given the opportunity of expressing a wishto join. This opportunity should be extended to Board of Trade officers at presentserving in Trade Commission appointments, officers serving on loan with theForeign Service and officers serving in this country on Home Service Allowanceterms*. It should be the aim of the Administration of the Diplomatic Service toaccept all those Trade Commission officers who apply to transfer. But it shouldnot be under an obligation to do so where there are substantial grounds for refusing a particular application. As in the case of the option granted to commonwealth Service Officers, the period during which this opportunity totransfer would remain open should be twelve months from the establishment ofthe new Service. Trade Commission officers who elect not to transfer should notnecessarily be removed from their present posts immediately. In some cases theymight stay until it is convenient to replace them either by a member of the new service or by another officer seconded from the Board of Trade. We wish to recordour view here that, both in the short and long term, the Board of Trade shouldcontinue to be consulted on appointments of all officers to fill commercial postsoverseas.58. When the initial twelve-month period is over, members of the Board ofTrade and other members of the Home Civil Service should be able, subject to theconsent of their Departments in each case, to apply for transfer to the diplomatic service. Similarly, members of the Diplomatic Service should be able to apply for transfer to the Home Civil Service. The receiving Department would retain fullfreedom to approve or refuse such applications. This is indeed the situation whichobtains at the present time, but we should like to see the machinery for suchtransfers used rather more often.59. We are anxious to ensure a full measure of interchange of staff on atemporary basis between the Home Civil Service, particularly the EconomicDepartments, and the Diplomatic Service. This will be to everyone&apos;s advantage.It is particularly desirable that there should be a high proportion of secondmentsfrom the Board of Trade. Many Board of Trade officers who have had recentcontact with industry in this country are well suited to serve abroad for a period in commercial posts, provided they are given facilities to learn the local languageand stay long enough to acquire the necessary local knowledge and contacts. Ontheir return their experience will make them of additional value to the Board ofTrade and the public service as a whole. We should like to see a traditionestablished by which a period of overseas service is regarded as a looked-forqualification in those who aspire to the higher ranks of the Board of Trade.60. It is difficult to predict at all precisely the calls the new Service will need to make upon the Board of Trade for seconded officers. Much will depend on, forexample, the extent to which trade work expands, the number of present membersof the Board of Trade who opt to join the new Service and the number of members* home service allowance terms apply to officers who have served overseas within the previousfive years and have accepted a liability to serve overseas again.
of the present Commonwealth Service who will be required to gain experience ofcommercial work. It would be a mistake to lay down a fixed quota of posts to be filled by seconded officers. This would make for rigidity and militate against theprinciple of appointing the best man available to each job as it falls vacant. Thenew Service will, however, always need, and should always have, a sizeable numberof secondments at all levels from the Board of Trade. The precise numbers, gradesand posts at any one time will have to be worked out by agreement betv/een theAdministration of the new Service and the Board of Trade; but we hope it will prove possible to have at least one officer with Board of Trade experience servingat one level or another at each major commercial post.61. Selected members of the permanent staff of the Diplomatic Service at all levels will benefit from periods of secondment to the Board of Trade, Treasury,Ministry of Defence and other Departments. Young officers from the diplomatic service should be accepted, especially by the Board of Trade, mainly for thepurpose of training and should be appointed to posts which will bring them intodirect touch with commerce and industry. More senior officers will be able to bring their knowledge of British industry and commerce up to date and at the same timebring their overseas experience to bear on the work of the Board of Trade.Secondments both to and from the Diplomatic Service are of great potential value,though we do not underestimate the difficulty of arranging them.62. If options are granted and secondments encouraged, the new Service will get off to the best possible start. It will not then be open to the dangers of havingincorporated within it a body of unwilling conscripts. It will be staffed by those towhom a life of overseas service is, on a balanced judgment in the light of the new conditions of service we recommend, an attractive and challenging proposition.The new Service will be constantly refreshed and invigorated by seconded officers from Home Departments. And, by means of secondments from the new diplomatic service to Home Departments, members of that Service will acquire special expertknowledge and at the same time broaden the experience available in Whitehall.Principles for the establishment of a combined Administration63. The full advantages of having a single world-wide Diplomatic Service willbe secured only if it is well administered. There should be a single administration to organise the unified Service abroad, to administer both the Foreign and commonwealth Relations Offices at home and to run common services throughoutthe world.64. The officer in charge of the combined Administration and common services will occupy a position of pivotal importance, particularly during the transitional period. This officer, who might be known as &quot; Chief of Administration &quot;,should be appointed by agreement between the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. His appointmentshould carry with it membership of the highest grade in the Diplomatic Service.This grading would match the responsibility of the post. The Chief ofAdministration would be responsible, through the Permanent Under-Secretary ofthe Foreign Office, to the Foreign Secretary for matters relating to the ForeignOffice and overseas posts under the direction of the Foreign Office. Similarly, hewould be responsible, through the Permanent Under-Secretary of theCommonwealth Relations Office, to the Commonwealth Secretary for matters relating to the Commonwealth Relations Office and overseas posts under thedirection of the Commonwealth Relations Office.65. It will be essential, especially during the transitional period, to ensurethat there is a reasonable balance in the combined Administration betweenpersonnel drawn from the present Foreign Service and from the presentCommonwealth Service. There should always be at least one senior officer withspecial Commonwealth experience within the sections dealing with establishments and personnel. It will also be essential for members of the combinedAdministration to be housed together from the start, so that they can consult eachother readily. Mutual confidence and understanding between the administratorsof the new Service will be vital in its early stages.66. Control of postings, promotions and retirements should be vested inJoint Promotions Boards on the lines of those at present used by the Foreign Officebut   with   membership   reconstituted   to   include  representation   from   the
Commonwealth Relations Office. The senior of these Joint Promotions Boards,making recommendations to Ministers for appointments at the Counsellor leveland above, should have the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office as its Chairman and the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Commonwealth relations office as its Deputy Chairman. Cross-posting of senior officers, of Counsellorrank and above, between the Foreign Office and foreign posts, on the one hand,and the Commonwealth Relations Office and Commonwealth posts, on the other,should be subject to the concurrence of both Permanent Under-Secretaries. the senior Joint Promotions Board would include Ministers and Under-Secretariesfrom both the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office. We hopeit will not be allowed to become too large and unwieldy a body. We do not wishto be dogmatic about its precise composition but suggest that membership on thefollowing lines might prove suitable:Permanent Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office (Chairman)Permanent Under-Secretary  of  State,  Commonwealth  Relations  Office(Deputy Chairman)A Minister nominated by the Foreign secretary Minister nominated by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the Chief of administration the Chief InspectorA Deputy Under-Secretary from the Foreign office a Deputy Under-Secretary from the Commonwealth Relations office the Head of the combined Personnel Department (Secretary)67. Agenda for meetings of this Board should be prepared by a Sub-Committeeover which the Chief of Administration would preside. The Sub-Committee should include the Chief Inspector and the Head of the combined Personnel Department.68. By these arrangements both Secretaries of State would be fully consulted,through their Permanent Under-Secretaries, on all senior promotions andappointments. Each would be able to exercise a veto over appointments within his own sphere. Junior Joint Promotions Boards, with appropriate Foreign Officeand Commonwealth Relations Office membership, would operate in accordancewith the same general principles. In practice, however, responsibility for applyingthem would rest mainly with the Head of the Personnel Department.69. Common recruitment, with single seniority lists for new entrants, should begin as soon as the new Service is formed. But the preparation of common senioritylists for the new Service as a whole will take time. This is a matter which will need careful handling. We think it would be wise to maintain for a period separateseniority lists, except for new entrants, within a common promotion system. Theselists would relate to former members of the Foreign Service, former members ofthe Commonwealth Service and former members of the Board of Trade. Theremay be other aspects of staff policy in which some phasing of the mergerarrangements would reduce administrative dislocation and avoid damage to staff morale.70. Promotions which take place after the inauguration of the combinedService should, of course, automatically form the basis of the new seniority lists,since the field of choice for such promotions will include all members of thenew Service. We do not in any case wish to see an over-emphasis on presentseniority when future promotions are under consideration. Seniority must play a part in promotion policy, especially at the lower levels, but merit and suitabilitymust always be the determining factor. We were assured by representatives of theStaff Sides that they would not object to this or to the abolition of devices, suchas &quot;Promotion Fields &quot;, which can restrict the Administration^ freedom to promoteable officers irrespective of their position on a list of seniority. We strongly recommend that neither &quot; Promotion Fields &quot; nor any other device having theeffect of enforcing &quot; Buggins&apos;s turn &quot; at the expense of merit should be carried overinto the promotion mechanisms of the new Service. Any efficient promotionssystem must be in a position to pick out a &quot; flyer &quot; and promote him over the heads of less gifted colleagues. It does not follow that the latter should not be promoted later if they are fitted for higher duties, still less that they should necessarily become candidates for premature retirement. But those who appearlikely to be called upon later in their careers to fill posts of the highest responsibility
Joint Services and Standard Procedures72. The policy-making parts of the Foreign Office and the commonwealth relations Office in London will continue to be separate for as long as a politicalneed for the retention of separate Offices is felt. Meanwhile, the two Offices shouldmake the maximum use of common services and adopt common standards anduniform procedures.73. As part of the combined Administration there should be, at least, a singlePersonnel Department, a single Establishment and Organisation Department withits own Organisation and Methods Section, a single Training Department and asingle Inspectorate. There should also be a single department or departments toarrange conferences and travel and look after buildings and supplies.74. Another field in which unification must be undertaken is communications.At present the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office have separatecommunications systems. These dual arrangements are wasteful and causeneedless delay in passing messages between British Missions in commonwealth countries and those in foreign countries (see para. 152). A joint communicationscentre and a common communications system should be brought into being as soonas possible. As a first step, equipment and methods should be standardised for the handling of both telegraphic and bag traffic. There should be a single system of telegram distribution and a uniform system of cyphers. Arrangements fordespatching diplomatic bags and ensuring their safety should also be undertaken on a co-ordinated world-wide basis.75. Many of these changes, particularly in the field of communications,presuppose common security standards and common procedures for applying them.Common security standards and procedures are needed, for example, in methodsof safeguarding diplomatic bags, in the use of diplomatic and commercial wirelessfacilities, in the use of locally-engaged staff and in personnel security generally. Itis therefore urgent to review security standards in both services in order to ensureuniformity and we recommend that the assistance of the Whitehall Committees onPersonnel and Physical Security, which include Security Service representatives,should be sought in laying down such standards for the new Diplomatic Service asa whole. A single Security Department for both Offices and the whole of the diplomatic Service should be introduced as soon as possible. The Head of thisDepartment should continue to be a member of the Diplomatic Service itself buthe should have special training and should have members of the Security Serviceseconded to his Department to take their place alongside members of the diplomatic Service.76. Other fields, such as Archives and Registry work, in which common services should be considered are dealt with in our recommendations aboutparticular branches of work. All joint services should be under the supervision of the Chief of Administration. The staff of joint services would need to be carefullychosen so as to provide a balance of Commonwealth and foreign experience as wellas the requisite technical knowledge.* Cmnd. 1432, para. 44.CONFIDENTIALmust be given accelerated promotion so that they may have time to be tested andacquire experience in the intermediate ranks of the Service.71. At this stage we should like to draw attention to the importance we attach to good management. The authors of the 1961 Report on the Control ofPublic Expenditure* observed that, as their investigations proceeded, they became&quot; increasingly conscious of the importance of management&quot;. This also has beenour experience. Good management is a matter which, both at home and abroad,must not be regarded as in any way inferior to policy work. All senior staff must accept that they have a responsibility for good management. If Administrationwork is regarded by senior officers as something which merits only their passingattention or if the Administration Officers are not up to their job, the effectiveness of the entire Service will be reduced. In a number of posts abroad, better trainedAdministration Officers of higher calibre, and sometimes of higher rank, arerequired. The new Service must be ready to vary the gradings of Administrationposts overseas, particularly at &quot; difficult &quot; places, in order to ensure the appointmentof the right man for the job.
Financial Control78. At present the Permanent Under-Secretaries of the Foreign Office andthe Commonwealth Relations Office are each answerable to Parliament asAccounting Officers for the expenditure of public funds by their respective departments. As the two Departments will continue as separate entities, no question arises about responsibility for what may be described as the &quot; political &quot; Votes ofthe two Departments. Responsibility for these must remain with the permanent under-Secretaries. At present each Permanent Under-Secretary is also responsibleas Accounting Officer for the &quot; administration &quot; Vote of his Department, in effect the cost of running and staffing the Foreign Office or Commonwealth relations office and the overseas posts for which each is responsible. The problem whicharises is who should assume financial responsibility for administrative expenditureof this kind when both the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices and their overseas posts are staffed by members of a single Diplomatic Service.79. The most logical and practical arrangement would be a single&quot; administration &quot; Vote with the Chief of Administration as the Accounting Officer.He would be assisted by two Finance Officers, one in the Foreign Office and one in the Commonwealth Relations Office. It would be contrary to our aims in proposing a unified Service with a unified Administration if it had to be split up again into its component parts for purposes of Vote structure. Any Vote structurewhich does not reflect a unified Administration would not only weaken theadministrative unity of the new Service but lead to an unnecessary and wastefulsystem of cross-accounting.80. The Treasury in evidence said that the arrangement we favour would be contrary to the principle that an Accounting Officer, as the person responsible tothe Public Accounts Committee and the Treasury, should be the person with whomthe final responsibility in fact rests. It was, in the Treasury view, necessary to preserve in principle and in practice the responsibility of the Permanent Under-Secretaries of the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices for theconsequences of policy decisions taken by them.81. We felt that the principles put to us by the Treasury had already beenbreached by the arrangements within the Ministry of Defence whereby the seniorPermanent Under-Secretary is not to be the Accounting Officer. Nor are weconvinced that the doctrinal objections are in the present case overwhelming. we hope that these objections will not prevail. Nevertheless, if the solution for financial control which we prefer is not considered acceptable, there is a possible alternativewhich we put forward as a second best. This alternative proposal we set out at annex E.82. Under this arrangement there would be separate commonwealth relations Office and Foreign Office Votes for which the two Permanent Under-Secretaries would be the respective Accounting Officers. Each Permanent Under-Secretary would have a &quot; political&quot; and an &quot; administration&quot; Vote. The&quot; administration &quot; Vote of the Foreign Office would cover the cost of staffing and running the Foreign Office and the overseas posts responsible to it; the&quot; administration &quot; Vote of the Commonwealth Relations Office would cover the costof staffing and running the Commonwealth Relations Office and the overseas postsfor which it is responsible. The cost of providing common services, includingcommunications, and the cost of running the combined Administration in london would be accounted for on the larger of the two &quot; administration &quot; Votes. TheCommonwealth Relations Office would make an appropriation in aid from its mainVote to the Foreign Service main Vote in respect of common service work done onbehalf of the Commonwealth Relations Office. Separate Finance Officers atCounsellor level would be retained in the Foreign Office and Commonwealth77. Although the Commonwealth Relations Office will still need to have aseparate Ceremonial Officer, there should be a single Protocol Department for bothOffices. Commonwealth Missions form part of the Diplomatic Corps in Londonand in many respects require the same forms of assistance as Missions from foreigncountries. New Missions establishing themselves in London, whether from foreignor Commonwealth countries, are already given advice and help on the problems of settling in. The new Protocol Department should continue this tradition.
. Relations Office. These officers would have direct access to their respective permanent under-Secretaries; but they would normally report through the Chief ofAdministration. The two Finance Officers must work in close co-operation andcontact with each other.83. We wish to make two points about this compromise scheme. First, allconcerned must ensure that inter-departmental accounting arrangements are keptsimple so that time is not wasted in working out unnecessary interdepartmentaldebits and credits. Second, even if it should prove impracticable to have a singleVote for all staff and administration expenditure in the early years of the diplomatic Service, such a Vote should nonetheless remain the aim.Ministerial Responsibility in Administrative Matters84. Occasions arise when a Ministerial decision is required in matters affecting individual staff members. Under present Foreign Service Regulations,decisions by the Foreign Secretary are called for in certain disciplinary cases andalso in such matters as divorce, marriage to foreigners and premature retirement.Similar decisions in respect of members of the Commonwealth Service may haveto be taken by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. The question arises where in a single Diplomatic Service Ministerial responsibility for suchcases should lie. There must be uniformity of treatment. At the same time itwould be invidious and burdensome to make one Minister rather than the other the ultimate authority. The right solution, we think, must be for the foreign secretary to be the final disciplinary authority for officers of the combined Serviceworking in the Foreign Office or in posts in foreign countries and for theCommonwealth Secretary to be the final disciplinary authority for those working in the Commonwealth Relations Office or in the posts in Commonwealth countries.The Chief of Administration, however, would use his discretion in cases in whichit would be desirable to ensure that both Ministers were consulted. If, forexample, a Ministerial decision were required in the case of an officer serving ina foreign country, the Chief of Administration would submit it to the permanent under-Secretary at the Foreign Office and through him to the Foreign Secretary.If, however, the officer had originally joined the Commonwealth Service and spenta large part of his career in that Service, the Chief of Administration would ensure that the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Commonwealth Relations Officeand the Commonwealth Secretary were also consulted.85. A definition will be needed in the regulations of the Diplomatic service to make it clear that the term &quot; Secretary of State &quot; is to be interpreted as meaningthe Foreign Secretary or the Commonwealth Secretary in accordance with these principles. We are confident that uniformity and fairness of treatment can besecured by proceeding in this way, particularly as all recommendations willoriginate in the combined Administration and be submitted through the Chiefof Administration.Manpower Requirements86. The staff needs of the Foreign and Commonwealth Services are governed by swiftly changing and frequently unpredictable international developments. Ifthe unified Service is to be in a position to respond quickly and in time to changingrequirements, it must have flexibility in the control and deployment of manpower.87. One of the greatest needs is for a sufficient margin of manpower tocover the time which officers necessarily spend away from their desks. time spent in travel, training, home leave and sick leave represents a severe drain on manpower resources in any overseas Service. We received convincing evidencethat the lack of an adequate reserve of manpower has been a serious impedimentto the efficient deployment of the present Foreign and Commonwealth Services.This has led to over-strain. There have been lengthy gaps at posts between the departure of an officer and the arrival of his successor; leave has had to be cutshort, hurried transfers arranged, family plans disrupted and training programmesabbreviated or cancelled. Officers at overseas posts have not been able to travelwithin, and get to know, their country of appointment as much as we thinkdesirable. We consider it vital to remedy this situation. Given a reasonable margin of manpower, it should be possible for the Administration of the diplomatic service to plan ahead, relating training programmes to future appointments and ensuring that due leave can be taken without leaving gaps between appointmentsCONFIDENTIAL3610 n
at busy posts. There will, of course, be occasions when emergencies will call for emergency dispositions but these should be the exception, not the rule.88. We have considered what reserve of manpower is required. A margin of 10% was suggested and, although a precise calculation is not possible, we are convinced that a reserve of this order is reasonable. We recommend, therefore,that the authorised manpower of the new Diplomatic Service should be calculated to include such a reserve. This reserve will have to be built up gradually.89. What we are proposing here is a permanent reserve to be retained forpurposes of training, travel, leave and sick leave. If a reserve were created onlyto be squandered by the creation of new operational posts the same stresses andstrains would simply reappear on a larger scale. Firm management must thereforeensure that this reserve is held and used for the purposes intended. It should alsoensure that, as requirements change and new commitments are accepted, oldcommitments which have ceased to be worthwhile should be dropped.90. The unified Service must feel primarily responsible for the commitmentsit accepts requiring the use of manpower. The Diplomatic Service, in the same way as Home Departments, will have to dispose its staff within a manpower ceilingagreed with the Treasury. It may be suggested that the operation of such a ceilingcan diminish a Departments sense of responsibility. We believe that the incentive to achieve a saving in actual manpower is reduced if the effect of achieving this isto invite a reduction of authorised manpower. The prospect of such a reductiondestroys the incentive to economy within a Department. Arbitrary reductions inauthorised manpower to meet the requirements of short-term economy driveshave much the same effect of diminishing the feeling of departmental responsibility.There is the added hazard that to close a post down and reopen it later may costmore than keeping it going. Moreover, &quot; chopping and changing &quot; cannot fail tohave a bad effect on morale. In our view, only the unified Service can judge wheretrue and lasting economies, relating to true changes in departmental policy, canbe achieved. For example, if a policy of disengagement in the Middle East makesstaffing economies possible, the overseas Departments should be in the best positionto know and take the necessary action.Branch Structure91. We have sought to devise a branch structure which will fit therequirements of the new Service and at the same time cure certain ills in the structure of the existing Services.92. The staff of the Commonwealth Service at present consists of 1,059officers serving in London and 2,422 officers overseas. Of these, the establishedofficers who would be eligible for transfer into the Diplomatic Service are dividedinto the following Home Civil Service Classes: Administrative (203),Executive (355), Clerical (386), Clerical Officer/Secretaries (113), ShorthandTypists (68), Security Guards (38), specialist staff (44) and messengerial grades (166).In addition, those eligible would include the 188 members of the separateInformation Class which, for purposes of pay and grading, is equated to theExecutive Class. Representational work overseas is undertaken by members ofthe Administrative, Executive and Information Classes. At present thirteen Headsof Mission (High Commissioners) in Commonwealth countries are CommonwealthService Officers; the remaining High Commissioner posts are at the moment filled by appointees from outside the Commonwealth Service. Most other appointmentsat senior and intermediate levels are filled by officers of the Administrative Class.Commonwealth Service officers do not do commercial work, though they do someeconomic work and reporting. Officers of the Information Class are employedalmost exclusively on information duties and fill nearly all the information posts.In our recommendations on information work (paras. 271-273) we propose theabolition of the present Information Class as a separate career structure. For thepurposes of the Diplomatic Service, we shall need a structure which will be ableto accommodate members of all other classes of the present CommonwealthService.93. The Trade Commission Service comprises at present 197 establishedofficers, divided into the following Home Civil Service classes: Administrative 38;Executive 133; and Clerical (including Secretarial) 26. The Service uses locally-engaged staff extensively for clerical and typing duties. A structure which would

A somewhat similar process has taken place in the CommonwealthService. In the main, the pattern has been for members of the administrative class to undertake the political and economic work, for the Executive Class todo consular, technical assistance and administration work and for the ClericalClass to do &quot;clerical &quot; work. As new Commonwealth countries became independentthe work of the Commonwealth Service increased dramatically. One means ofaccommodate members of the Commonwealth Service would, therefore,conveniently accommodate also those members of the Trade Commission Servicewho would join the new Service on transfer and those members of the Board ofTrade who would serve with it on secondment. The senior Trade CommissionService officer in a country is normally a member of the Administrative class; hisgrade depends upon the size and importance of the country. Other members ofthe Administrative class serve in capital cities where there is a high proportion ofeconomic and trade policy work or, as heads of post, in non-capital cities whichare of high commercial importance. Chief Executive Officers and Senior executive officers serve in some capitals, where they are engaged mainly on trade promotionwork, or are heads of post in outstations where most of the work is commercial.Other Executive class officers concentrate on trade promotion work but may alsoundertake general economic work and administration.94. The Foreign Service has a structure of its own. It is at present composedof five main &quot; Branches &quot;, namely A, B, C, D and T. Branch A, the senior branch,corresponds to the Administrative Class of the Home Civil Service. It has 759members, who occupy nearly all senior posts concerned with policy, both at homeand abroad. The greater number are engaged in political, economic and commercialduties; others are engaged in information and consular work and in administration.Branch B corresponds in the range of its responsibilities to both the Executive andClerical Classes of the Home Civil Service. With 1,839 members it is the largestbranch in the Foreign Service comprising nearly half its total permanently-established strength. Its members perform a great variety of duties both at homeand abroad, including consular, information, commercial, administration, accounts,communications and registry work. Branch C, which numbers nearly 700, iscomposed entirely of women. Their duties are secretarial. Branch D providesChancery Guards and messengers for posts abroad. It is the smallest branch ofthe Service with 213 men. Branch T consists of just over 300 non-industrial officersof the Diplomatic Wireless Service. This Service is responsible for transmittingtelegrams to and from posts overseas.95. It was envisaged in 1943 that members of Branch A would do all thepolitical and economic work of the Foreign Service and that officers of thatBranch would also occupy most of the consular posts which entailed holdingThe Queen&apos;s Commission. But as the commitments of the Foreign Service grewover the years, Branch A was increasingly unable to staff all the &quot; representational &quot;posts in the political, economic and consular fields, despite a fairly substantial increase in its size. Thus, over a period of nearly twenty years, many posts of a kind which it was expected would be held by officers of Branch A were graduallytaken over by members of Branch B. By August 1963 this process had resultedin the following broad distribution of senior posts between the two Branches:
helping to cope with the increased work has been to use Executive Class officers for duties to which Administrative Class officers might have been appointed had they been available.97. In terms of the scope and interest of the work there can be no doubtthat the trend towards the filling of Branch A posts in the Foreign Service byBranch B officers has improved and brightened the career prospects of many members of Branch B. It is entirely right that opportunities of this kind shouldbe open to all on the basis of qualifications and of merit judged by performance.But the pressure of circumstances during recent years has prevented a systematictreatment of this question. We have devoted special efforts to finding a new structure which will meet the problem more adequately in the future. We have alsotaken account of the feeling of dissatisfaction which we heard expressed aboutthe existing title &quot; Branch B &quot;. Some members of the Branch are unhappy because,in their view, the title carries with it a suggestion of inferior status.98. With the growth in its size and range of duties, Branch B has becomesomewhat amorphous. With responsibilities ranging from the diplomatic andadministrative through the executive to the clerical, its functions and the careerexpectations of its members are not as clearly defined as they should be. Thishas complicated recruitment, training and deployment.99. A still more important question is the fitness and suitability of Branch Bofficers for the duties they are likely to be called upon to do. We have little doubtthat the process of filling large numbers of posts requiring &quot; Administrative Class &quot;(Branch A) abilities with men of only average &quot; Executive Class &quot; (Branch B) talentsis unsatisfactory. There is a justifiable difference between the standards required of Branch A officers and those required of Branch B officers at the recruitingstage and it is only to be expected that this distinction will continue to show itself in greater or lesser degree throughout the career span of most of them. Therewill certainly be Branch B officers who show themselves fitted to undertake afull range of Branch A work. For these, the correct answer should be a permanenttransfer into Branch A; a process known as &quot;bridging&quot; already exists for thepurpose but has been somewhat conservatively used. We want to make &quot; bridging &quot;a more regular feature of career planning in the Diplomatic Service and we latermake proposals which should facilitate this (paras. 101-104). There will alsobe good Branch B officers who are well qualified to fill certain Branch A posts,though not a sufficiently wide range of post to warrant their permanent transferinto Branch A.A new Grades Structure for the Administrative, Executive and Clerical Classes100. Various remedies were proposed. These fell into two main groups.On the one hand, it was proposed that Branch B should be split into two partsto form an &quot; Executive Branch &quot; and a &quot; Clerical Branch &quot;. This would be on thelines of the split which is already accepted practice in the Home Civil Service.On the other hand, it was put to us that, if no formal distinction at all were made between Branches A and B and they were amalgamated into a single Branch witha single ladder of promotion, many of the present difficulties would disappear.Neither proposition is really satisfactory. A division of Branch B into separateExecutive and Clerical Branches might ease the problems of management but itwould exacerbate rather than relieve the problem of the relationship betweenBranches A and B. The alternative proposal for a &quot; one-branch &quot; Service with different points of entry corresponding to different educational standards andlevels of ability is at first sight attractive. But so radical a change would createserious problems. It would require the new Service to adopt a structure and set of pay scales divorced from those of the Home Civil Service. This we cannotadvise for a number of reasons. It would make transfers and secondments to andfrom the Home Civil Service more difficult. It would go contrary to what webelieve is required in the field of foreign allowances, namely, a rational system which can be applied equitably to all classes of public servants serving overseas.Moreover, taking into account relative bargaining strengths, we seriously doubt whether the introduction of grade and pay scales divorced from those of the home civil Service would work to the advantage of the Diplomatic Service. A single-branch system has not proved an unqualified success in other countries where ithas been tried. It does not take sufficient account of genuine and valid distinctions
29between different types of work and the different qualities needed for these. Such asystem could have an adverse effect on recruitment. Nor, by any means, would all members of Branch B or of the Executive Class in the Commonwealth andTrade Commission Services relish the creation of a system in which they wouldbe in direct competition with colleagues of higher educational attainments. Somewould feel that they had lost a career best suited to their abilities and had exchangeda career structure giving them reasonable promotion prospects for one offeringonly an illusion of unlimited possibilities.101. We have therefore tried to avoid the extremes of integration and offragmentation. The system which is needed ought to give proper opportunitiesand status for members of all branches of the present Foreign, commonwealth and Trade Commission Services. It should at the same time acknowledge truedifferences of function and ability. It should preserve present links with the salary structure of the Home Civil Service. And it should meet the special needs of arepresentational Diplomatic Service. We think the following scheme, embracingten grades, offers the most promising solution:NewGrade1.1Classes included in new Grades2. ^Administrative only.J4/Administrative and Executive6.

Accelerated promotion from Grade 7 to Grade 5 would be possiblefor outstanding Executive Class Officers &quot; bridging &quot; to the Administrative Class.(iv) The present Bl A Grade ( 2,683- 3,l 15) should be abolished, its posts being regraded over aperiod of time as 4 or 5. The same would apply to the Grade of Senior Chief executive officer in the Home Civil Service.102. This scheme maintains separate Administrative, Executive and Clericalpay scales, entry points and promotion streams. But it brackets grades in such away as to make it difficult for anyone to be publicly labelled as in one stream or another. An officer who may now feel bound to describe himself as a member ofGrade 3 of Branch B of the Foreign Service rather than by his diplomatic orconsular rank could, under our proposal, describe himself simply as a memberof Grade 6 of the Diplomatic Service. He could, but need not, add that he was amember of the Executive Class. Similarly, an existing B2 officer in the foreign service or Chief Executive Officer in the Commonwealth or Trade CommissionService would become an officer of Grade 5 of the Diplomatic Service.103. There is perhaps some awkwardness in having different salary scaleswithin one grade; but in no case is the salary variation large. If pressure should develop to unify salary scales within grades it could properly be resisted on theground that the link with Home Civil Service salary scales should be preserved,that its preservation is in the interests of the members of the new Service and thatit is justified by the different methods of entry, educational attainments and careerperformance.
104. It is a cardinal point in our plan that the containment of separate Classeswithin a single grades structure will make &quot; bridging &quot; easier and more natural.An Executive Class officer in Grade 7 could be tried out in an Administrative Classappointment within the same Grade. If he made good, he would be &quot; bridged &quot; tothe Administrative Class; if not, he would remain in the same Grade with no loss offace. A member of Grade 6 might&quot; bridge &quot; into Grade 5 as an Administrative Classofficer or be promoted into Grade 5 as an Executive Class officer.Problems of Branch A and the Administrative Class105. One important structural problem affects Branch A of the Foreign Serviceand the Administrative Class in the Commonwealth Service. For some years therehas been a serious promotion blockage in the A7 (First Secretary) Grade in theForeign Service and to a lesser extent the Principal Grade of the CommonwealthService. This has damaged career prospects. We have examined this situation withgreat care and sympathy. It does not contribute to the efficiency of a service, in thelong run or in the short, to hold down good officers below the levels for which theyare suited and qualified. And it is frustrating for such officers to be held back intheir careers.106. However, none of the solutions proposed which asked for immediateor dramatic action seemed to us wise. One possibility we considered was to splitthe existing A7 (Principal) grade into two by forming a new &quot; Junior Counsellor &quot;grade. It was put to us that there is a range of posts, including those of AssistantHeads of Foreign Office departments and Heads of Chancery or Sections inEmbassies abroad, for which such a new rank would be appropriate. To keep anable man who is judged likely material for senior appointments later on for twelve years or more in the same rank, as can happen at present, is not the way to enable him to develop his full potential. But there are dangers in making permanent changes of structure to deal with difficulties which, however painful, are at root of atemporary nature only. Their basic cause is that a large number of officersof the same age-group were recruited to fill vacancies at the end of the war. It ispointless at this stage to argue whether in the particular circumstances of the time this could have been avoided. For the future, however, only the maintenance of even recruitment, the avoidance of sudden large changes in the size of the unified service and a more selective promotions policy will avoid a repetition of presenttroubles. Whatever changes are made in the grades structure, promotion blockageswill still occur unless these conditions are met.107. We seriously doubt whether the creation of an intermediate gradewould be helpful. It would simply provide a further means of delaying the realadvancement of outstanding officers.108. Officers of exceptional promise should be promoted to Counsellor(Assistant Secretary) at the earliest possible age so as to give them time to gainexperience in that rank and continue up the ladder to the highest posts. Good officersought to be promoted in their early forties. Average officers can be promoted later;for them the rank of Counsellor can be an honourable climax to their career.109. We are conscious that the promotion blockage has meant financialdifficulty for a number of officers. This difficulty is not in itself an argument forthe creation of an extra grade. It does, however, reinforce the need for changes in conditions of service and we hope and believe that our recommendations under this head will be of particular benefit to officers involved in the A7 promotions blockage.110. The ideal size of the Administrative Class in the new Service poses afurther problem. It has been the tradition, and a good tradition, that the seniorBranch of the Foreign Service, like the Administrative Class of the Home CivilService, should be small in numbers but of undeniable quality. When the diplomatic service is formed, the Administrative Class cadre within it is likely to number about1,000. We recognise that too many posts which call for Administrative Class qualitieshave been handed over to Executive Class officers and that some of these postsought to reclaimed. But it would clearly not be possible to re-staff all such posts withAdministrative Class officers without expanding the size of the Administrative Class.A further increase in the size of the Administrative Class cadre will in any case berequired in the process of building up its share of the reserve of manpower needed to permit more training, give greater flexibility and reduce strain.
Power to vary staff gradings113. The Foreign Office has delegated authority, provided its total manpowerdoes not exceed an authorised ceiling, to vary gradings up to and including the rank of First Secretary (A7). If the Foreign Office wishes, for example, to raise oneof its posts from Second to First Secretary level or to down-grade a post from first secretary to Second Secretary, it has power to do this without seeking approvalfrom the Treasury. If, however, the Foreign Office wishes to up-grade a first secretary post to Counsellor or a Counsellor post to Minister or to create a newAmbassadorial post, it must first secure Treasury authority unless it is possibleto make an equal and opposite down-grading at the same time. In the interestsof flexibility, the Foreign Office would like to have their present authority to varygrades, without simultaneous equivalent down-grading, extended by one grade toinclude officers of Grade A6 (Grade 4 in the new Service). It was represented tous that this grade is a multi-purpose one and that it is necessary to be able to switchofficers in it freely and quickly to fill many different kinds of appointment. An A6officer may be a Counsellor of Embassy, a Consul-General or an Ambassador ata small post, the Head of a Consular, Information or Administrative Section at alarge post or a Head of Department in the Foreign Office.114. The Treasury agreed that there was a need for flexibility at this levelbut pointed out that a small &quot; float&quot; of A6 posts had been given to the ForeignOffice to enable it to deal with this problem. Possibly, however, this &quot; float&quot; wasnot big enough. At present specific authority for all regradings at or above the comparable grade in the Home Civil Service had to be sought. In the Treasuryview, the similarities in this respect between Home Civil Service and foreign service conditions outweighed the dissimilarities and justified the maintenance ofthe requirement that the Foreign Service should seek Treasury authority forregradings at A6 level.115. We are not convinced that the needs of an overseas representationalservice are truly comparable in this matter with the needs of the home departments. Requirements overseas can change rapidly, unexpectedly and in away which is not due to any British initiative and indeed which we often cannotprevent. We recommend, therefore, that the new Diplomatic Service should have more latitude than the Foreign Service has at present. We also recommend that,if the new Service is given authority to regrade posts at Counsellor level, its administration should accept a clear obligation to use this authority wiselyand with moderation. The extended discretion is intended to give a greater degreeof administrative flexibility and not to bring about a general change in the basicproportions of the different grades.116. The new Service should also, we think, be more flexible in the grading of Ambassadorial and High Commissioner posts. It should grade such postsaccording to current requirements and responsibilities and not according totradition alone. The Diplomatic Service will not need any specific new authorityat this level, mainly Grade 3 and above. What we have in mind is a matter of administrative practice.111. Some limit must be set to the size of the Administrative Class in thenew Service if quality is to be maintained. We were advised by the First CivilService Commissioner that it would be possible to expand Administrative Classrecruitment for the new Service by between five and eight recruits a year. Ratherthan aim at any larger expansion than this, we should prefer to see the additional staff requirements which the new Service will undoubtedly have met by extraExecutive recruitment of an improved quality.112. The new grades structure we propose can, we believe, make a usefulcontribution. In our recommendations on recruitment in Chapter Four, we shallpoint to the desirability on general grounds of widening the entry into the new service. If recruitment of high quality entrants to Grade 9 of the new Service canbe increased, further expansion of the Administrative Class can be kept to aminimum. It is also our hope that outward distinctions between the administrative and Executive Classes will be less marked than the present ones betweenBranches A and B. If care is taken to ensure that members of the administrative class cadre are sent to fill posts where they are really needed, members of theExecutive Class cadre could well be chosen to fill the remaining posts.
The Role of Women117. We received evidence from a number of women&apos;s organisations on thepart which women should play in the overseas representational services. these organisations were principally concerned to ensure that women should have thesame opportunities and obligations as men at every stage of their career. the irrepresentations were therefore mainly directed at the present rules about the recruitment of women into the Foreign Service and at the &quot; marriage bar &quot;.118. When the Foreign Service was opened to women in 1945, a rule wasmade limiting their recruitment to posts in Branch A to 10% of the total intakein any one year. This 10% limitation is in fact a dead letter. There has never beenoccasion to apply it. Its retention is a pointless irritant and we recommend that itbe dropped.119. The &quot;marriage bar&quot; represents a more serious problem. Even forunmarried women diplomats, there are often severe difficulties in arranging suitableoverseas appointments. We were assured, and we accept, that these difficulties arenot due to any restrictive attitude on the part of the Foreign Office but are related to the customs and practices of some foreign countries, in the Middle East forexample. The difficulties in the way of posting married women overseas could inmany cases prove overwhelming. If the husband has a job of his own, this will normally preclude him from accompanying his wife on her postings abroad. If,on the other hand, he is able to move from post to post with his wife, and few willin fact be able to do so, it is hard to see what contribution he can make to the workof the Service. We are convinced that there are valid reasons for the existence ofthe &quot; marriage bar &quot;, although none of them reflect in any way on the fitness orability of the women themselves.120. The Foreign Secretary has, however, discretion to make exceptions.The Foreign Service Regulations state that &quot; as a rule a woman member of theService will be required to resign upon marriage, but the Secretary of Statereserves the right in special circumstances to permit her to continue as a memberof the Service, either unconditionally or subject to conditions &quot;. Exceptions underthis formula have on occasion been made but we think its emphasis is undulyrestrictive. We suggest that a new formula should be introduced for the DiplomaticServices on the following lines:&quot; Any woman member of the Diplomatic Service who proposes to marrymust notify the Personnel Department of her intention. The Secretary ofState reserves the right to require her to resign either upon marriage or lateror to attach conditions to her continuation as a member of the Service &quot;.121. We doubt whether it will often happen that a woman will wish toremain in the Diplomatic Service after marriage. In most cases it will be herintention to settle down with her husband in this country or wherever he maybe living. But a revised regulation on the lines we have suggested should encourage a more liberal attitude wherever practicable.122. When a woman member of the Diplomatic Service wishes it, it maybe possible to arrange for her on marriage to be offered a transfer to the home civil Service. The Treasury have assured us that they will always be preparedto give sympathetic consideration to an application for transfer to the home civil Service in such cases, but they should not, of course, be expected to givea guarantee of employment. Other factors than the competence of the individualwould necessarily have to be taken into account.123. We endorse the view that women officers should be employed aswidely as possible in the Diplomatic Service. No artificial or unnecessaryrestrictions should be placed on their duties or postings. There are someappointments for which women are especially well suited and others in whichthey are less likely to be successful. But we should like to make it clear that we received no evidence which would suggest that women in the Foreign Servicehave proved &quot; tender plants &quot;. We came upon not a few instances in which, toput it no higher, they had withstood disagreeable climatic, political or living conditions with fully as much resource and fortitude as their male colleagues.124. We wish in this context to emphasize and pay tribute to the part played by the wives of Foreign and Commonwealth Service Officers. Their role
Secretarial Assistance125. We recommend that members of Branch C of the Foreign Serviceand established typists, shorthand typists and Personal Assistants in theCommonwealth Service should together form the &quot; Secretarial Branch &quot; of the diplomatic Service. In addition, established secretarial staff (Clerical Officer/Secretaries) in the Trade Commission Service should have the opportunity to join.126. Branch C of the Foreign Service has at present an establishment of678. This comprises 3 senior or supervisory posts, 225 Personal Assistants, 300Shorthand typists, and 150 copy typists. Details of the numbers, grades and payscales are given in Annex F. The Commonwealth Service has 109 PersonalAssistants, known as Clerical Officer/Secretaries, 66 shorthand typists and 58copy typists. The Trade Commission Service has a complement of 19 ClericalOfficer/Secretaries. The rates of pay for these members of the commonwealth and Trade Commission Services are the same as those for Branch C of theForeign Service.127. A woman joining Branch C of the Foreign Service is at first appointed on a temporary basis but arrangements for her establishment are made withinher first year of service if she proves satisfactory. On establishment she is appointed to Grade C2 if she is a copy typist or to Grade Cl if she is a shorthandtypist. A copy typist who becomes proficient in shorthand can be transferred from Grade C2 to Grade Cl. Substantive promotion for Cl&apos;s is to Grade B6C,the junior grade of Branch B Personal Assistant; the suffix &quot;C&quot; differentiatesthis grade from Clerical Officers. Thereafter, promotion to B5C and B4C ispossible. Alternatively, a woman may transfer to general duties in Branch B.She then becomes eligible for promotion through the normal Branch B grades.128. An established shorthand typist (Cl) can normally expect substantivepromotion to B6C after about three years. She can look forward to becoming aB5C after a further five to ten years, depending on ability. Promotion for a copytypist (C2) is much slower. A C2 is normally considered for promotion to B6after ten years; promotion to B5 becomes possible after a further ten years.129. For every shorthand typist and Personal Assistant needed for service in the Foreign Office in London two are needed at Foreign Service posts abroad.The Commonwealth Relations Office, on the other hand, needs two establishedshorthand typists in London for each one abroad since it can make more use oflocally-engaged shorthand typists overseas. The Commonwealth Relations Officemaintains Personal Assistants (Clerical Officer/Secretaries) in approximately equal numbers at home and abroad. Both Services have found it necessary to insist that established Personal Assistants and shorthand typists should accept an obligation for world-wide service. It has not, however, proved necessary or desirable to insist that copy typists should in all cases undertake to serve abroad.The Foreign Office needs only one copy typist overseas for every five copy typistsrequired in London; the Commonwealth Relations Office does not at present sendcopy typists overseas at all. The Foreign Office relies to a large extent onlocally-engaged staff to do copy typing overseas and the Commonwealth relations office exclusively.130. Both the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office have great difficulty in recruiting enough typists and shorthand typists for their needsdespite a continuous programme of advertisement and recruiting campaigns in schools and secretarial colleges. Branch C of the Foreign Service is belowstrength and has been for some time. The problem of recruiting copy typists isparticularly great. Indeed, we were told that the promotion of existing copy typistshas had to be held back because of the difficulty of finding suitable replacements.The Commonwealth Service is up to strength in copy typists but the situation is nevertheless unsatisfactory because they come and go rapidly. The commonwealth relations Office is 26% below strength in shorthand typists.is important both from a private and a public point of view. A wife has to cope with the special family problems inherent in a career of constant movement andat the same time make a contribution with her husband to the work, welfare andway of life of an overseas Mission. It is no easy task to combine these roles andour proposals on conditions of service take account of this.
131. The Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office describedtheir recruiting problems as serious. They ascribe their difficulties primarily tothe inadequacy of the pay scales for typists and shorthand typists. They considered,in particular, that starting pay for certain age ranges was too low to meet outsidecompetition. For shorthand typists, promotion and long-term pay prospects, they thought, compared favourably with outside employment but the incentives of promotion and long-term pay prospects did not in their experience solve the recruitment problem. For copy typists not only was the starting pay unattractivebut promotion prospects were poor. Where promotion could reasonably beexpected, this took a long time to materialise. Special proficiency allowances of9s. 6d. a week for audio typists were too low to afford an effective incentive toundertake this type of work, which is not always popular. We asked how farmechanical aids had been introduced to help counter-balance shortages of personnel and to speed up the work. We were told that security requirementsrestricted the use which could be made of mechanical aids abroad.132. A further obstacle to the recruitment of typists, we were informed, layin the fact that work in the overseas Services often runs into leisure hours. Hoursof work for senior members of Branch C are particularly long and erratic.Overtime is not paid at overseas posts. At home, the loss of leisure, although tosome extent compensated by overtime, has the effect of deterring recruits andcauses resignations. Both Departments believe, however, that it is mainly in thefield of pay and gradings that changes are necessary to improve recruitment.133. The Foreign Office proposed that an improvement in salary scales,particularly in starting pay, should be accompanied by a revision of the structure of Branch C. These proposals are set out at Annex G. Under this scheme, the branch would have five grades. This, it was suggested, would permit more evenrecruitment and allow members of the Branch to seek advancement within thesecretarial field rather than by transferring to Clerical or Executive duties.134. The Treasury said in evidence that the shortage of typing staff was nota problem peculiar to the Foreign and Commonwealth Services. It affected thepublic service as a whole, as well as industry and commerce. The supply of typists,particularly in London, was well below total demand; almost all employers hadrecruitment difficulties. There was some reason to hope, however, that the supply would improve as the number of girls leaving school increases in the next fewyears.135. The Treasury informed us that the rates of pay of the Civil Servicetyping grades had been fixed in 1959. This had followed reference to the CivilService Arbitration Tribunal on the basis of a pay research survey of the remuneration, including benefits in kind, paid by good outside employers. since then the rates had been improved by over 15% as a result of central pay increases which reflected trends in outside pay. There was therefore a prima facie case for believing that pay rates for Civil Service typing staff were not greatly out of line with those paid outside. The Pay Research Unit were currently completing afresh survey of outside rates. They would report on outside levels of pay andfurnish evidence of fringe benefits such as luncheon vouchers and travel assistance.On the basis of this evidence, negotiations would take place with staff representatives and new scales of pay would be introduced with effect from 1st January, 1964. The Treasury appreciated that the typing problem was a seriousone in the public service as a whole. Independently of the survey of the pay research Unit, the Treasury were conducting a domestic review of the structure,pay and recruitment of the typing grades in the Civil Service. Whatever changesresulted from the pay research review and from the review of the structure wouldbe applied to the Foreign and Commonwealth Services as to the rest of the publicservice. In the Treasury view, it would not therefore be desirable to makeadjustments in the pay and structure of the typing grades in these Services inadvance of the review as a whole.136. We are persuaded that the Foreign and Commonwealth Services have serious problems in regard to the recruitment and retention of shorthand and copytypists. These problems cannot be other than a threat to efficiency. No permanentcure can be expected until recruiting improves. We are not satisfied that the presentgrading structure is correct or that the present pay scales are adequate throughout.We also think it wrong that the promotion of experienced typists who have thenecessary qualifications for promotion should be held up because new recruits
&apos;    196CONFIDENTIAL 35 &apos;cannot be found to replace them. Moreover, the problems of the overseas Servicesdo not seem to us in all respects the same as those of the Home Civil Service. the overseas Services have to relate recruitment policies to overseas as well as to domestic needs and are restricted for security reasons in the use they can make of mechanical aids. A secretary in one of the overseas Services may be called uponto show more resilience and adaptability in the course of her career, especially when serving abroad, and to accept more responsibility than a secretary in theHome Civil Service. We draw special attention to the contribution made by the personal Assistant of a Head of Mission and believe that a way should be found of matching her grading to her status.137. On the other hand, we think it desirable as a matter of general principle to preserve a direct link between the pay scales of the overseas Services and thoseof the Home Civil Service and to give any necessary compensations or inducementsto members of the Diplomatic Service in other ways. It is, moreover, clear that theproblem of recruiting secretarial staff is, in its main impact, a general one affectingthe Home Civil Service and the overseas Services in broadly the same way. Itwould not therefore be right or realistic to recommend the introduction of special and separate pay scales for secretarial staff in the overseas Services in advance ofthe investigation being undertaken on a wider basis by the Pay Research Unit andby the Treasury.138. We believe that the Treasury review should be pressed forward withall speed. A settlement of the pay scales, based on the Pay Research Unit report,must be regarded as urgent. We hope this will overcome the main recruitingdifficulties. We should like the proposals in Annex G to be carefully andsympathetically considered in the course of the review. The present possibilities of promotion into the Executive Grades should not be prejudiced in any new gradesstructure.139. We accept that the possibilities for employing technical aids may be somewhat restricted, mainly for security and organisational reasons, in the foreign and Commonwealth Services. But the new Diplomatic Service, and particularly the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices in London, should invest in and experiment with modern reproduction equipment and systems. These, webelieve, would not only mitigate some of the consequences of the shortage of typistsand shorthand typists but help to overcome it by making some of the work more attractive. Some of the drudgery might, for instance, be removed from theday-to-day tasks of copy typists.140. It was put to us that many shorthand typists dislike the anonymity ofworking in &quot; pools &quot;. It would help if an intermediate grade were introduced foraudio typists who might then be allocated to one or more First Secretaries/Principals. The arguments for and against &quot; pools &quot; are well known. On the onehand, &quot; pools &quot; allow work to be shared evenly; the arrangement is held to be efficient from the administrative point of view. On the other hand, copy typistsworking in &quot; pools &quot; may have to take dictation on subjects which are new tothem. Lack of knowledge increases mistakes and diminishes interest. Shorthand oraudio typists assigned to small groups of officers might welcome the chance of taking an interest in a limited group of subjects and of becoming one of a team.We think that this idea has possibilities.141. It has also been argued that shorthand typists might be used to take some of the burden of paper work from the officers for whom they work and thusenable these officers to achieve a higher productivity. It is difficult to strike a balance but we believe that the present scale of secretarial assistance to officers is somewhat too low. The new Diplomatic Service should make more flexible use ofthe powers the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office already have to allocate available typing resources to best advantage. The aim should beto bring shorthand and copy typists more closely into the work of their departments and, wherever possible, to relieve more highly paid officers of tasks which might be better done by others. Better-designed accommodation would bea great help.142. At present there is a rule in the Foreign Service that typists andshorthand typists are not normally appointed to serve at overseas posts on aresidential basis until they reach the age of 21. This is a sensible rule which
should apply in the Diplomatic Service. It need not, however, prevent youngerwomen from being sent overseas when required for conferences and other briefvisits.143. At some Commonwealth posts, we think there is an undue reliance onlocally-recruited secretarial staff. Locally-recruited staff are less costly and weshould not wish to see them replaced on any larger scale than may prove desirable for security reasons. In many cases locally-recruited secretarial staff have givenyears of efficient and devoted service and action should therefore not be undulyhurried. But there are inevitably some secretarial appointments abroad which arenow better held by home-based staff if the risk of embarrassment is to be avoided.Chancery Guards and Messengers144. Branch D has at present 133 established men and 80 unestablished.They are employed abroad only. They maintain the physical security of Embassies,Missions and Consulates, help guard diplomatic mail and carry out generalmessengerial duties. There are three grades, with the following rates of pay:145. At Commonwealth Service posts there are 38 unestablished SecurityGuards who were recruited in Britain. Their rates of pay and conditions of service are the same as for members of Grade D3 in the Foreign Service. At posts wherethere is a Chief Security Guard he is paid an extra allowance of  100 &quot;per annum.There are also 69 locally-engaged Security Guards. In many commonwealth countries it was at first possible as a rule to engage suitable Security Guards locally.This course was much cheaper than employing home-based staff and was widelyadopted. Local recruits also have the advantage of knowing local languages and customs. But it is now becoming increasingly necessary in most commonwealth countries to have a higher proportion of home-based guards. We understand that commonwealth Relations Office Security Guards carry diplomatic bags despite the fact that the locally-engaged officers among them are not necessarily UnitedKingdom citizens. This cannot be regarded as satisfactory.146. Recruits for Branch D and for the home-based cadre of theCommonwealth Service are often ex-Servicemen or ex-members of the policebetween the ages of 30 and 50 and already in receipt of a pension. Preference isgiven to married men without dependent children, although some single men arerecruited. All members of Branch D are engaged on a temporary basis in the firstinstance. After three years&apos; service, including a tour in an Iron Curtain country,an officer becomes eligible for establishment. His unestablished service counts forthe purpose of calculating his pension rights.147 Wastage is fairly high, occurring mainly in the junior grade (D3).Although promotion prospects are not good, this does not appear to be a cause for concern to men who, for the most part, are making a second pensionablecareer. We found some discontent, however, that it had been the practice in thepast not to establish more than 100 officers out of the complement of 170/180 D3posts. We are glad to learn that this arbitrary limit has now been dropped.148. Of the posts in which members of Branch D are employed, forty-sixare in Communist countries, where for security and other reasons the tour of dutyis only one year. This frequent movement to and from posts in Communist countries has a chain reaction and effectively reduces the length of stay of officers at otherposts. It is rarely possible for a man to be left more than eighteen months at anyone place. This increases the personal problems of the members of the Branchas well as the cost of running it.149. The sickness rate among officers in the Branch and their wives is abovethe average for the Foreign Service as a whole, partly because the average age is higher. This further increases posting problems. The need to find replacementsat short notice for officers who fall sick or have to be moved for other reasonsmakes it difficult to plan ahead or to give officers and posts reasonable notice of transfers. A main cause of complaint amongst members of the Branch is that they receive insufficient notice when they are to be moved elsewhere.DlD2D3 784- 923 729- 830 623- 678
150. At present Branch D has ten &quot; overlap &quot; posts to make up for time spent on leave or travel. This overlap &quot;pool&quot; is sufficient to enable transfers atsensitive posts to be made without gaps but it is not large enough to be used asa reserve on which to draw to fill unforeseen vacancies. A project to form a &quot; Londonpool&quot;, consisting of newly recruited men who would work in the Foreign Officeuntil required to go abroad, has not proved possible because most new entrantscome from the provinces and cannot afford to keep two homes going. We enquire whether a lodging allowance would enable this project to go forward but were informed that it would not be a sufficient inducement unless the rates were extremely high.151. In the preceding paragraphs we have concentrated on Branch D of theForeign Service as it is at present because, we believe, a study of its methods,conditions of service and problems is the best guide to what will be required forthe Diplomatic Service. We recommend that (a) there should be a Messengerial and Chancery Guard Branch formed byamalgamating Branch D of the Foreign Office and the Security Guardsof the Commonwealth Service;(b) the proportion of home-based to locally-engaged Guards in commonwealth countries should be increased as necessary to ensure the maintenanceof security standards;(c) a greater reserve of man-power should be built up so as to enable postingsto be planned in a less piecemeal fashion and to allow of longer noticeof transfer. There will be administrative problems about where and how members of this reserve should be stationed and maintained.These will require administrative action by the new Service and further consultation with the Treasury;(d) transfer to the Executive Grades for suitably qualified members of theMessengerial Grades should be possible.We believe that these changes would go far towards meeting the legitimatecriticisms we have heard about some aspects of the work of Chancery Guardsand Messengers. Their work may not often be in the limelight but it should notbe allowed to go unnoticed. Much depends upon it.Communications Branch152. The Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office systems of communications are for the most part separate; this arrangement is open to serious criticism. The most obvious weakness is that there is no direct link whicha post in a Commonwealth country can use if it wishes to send a confidentialmessage to a post in a neighbouring foreign country. Such a post has to send itsmessage to London, where it is transferred by a complicated process from theCommonwealth Relations Office to the Foreign Office. Only then can it be transmitted to its destination. The same time-wasting process would be involvedin the reply. Our overseas representational services cannot be expected to operateefficiently if they do not have an effective interconnecting system of communications. There have, we were told, been moves recently to bring the communications systems closer together; but more than this is needed. A unified service will demand a unified system of communications.153. At present, the normal method of transmitting messages between theCommonwealth Relations Office and posts in Commonwealth countries is byCable and Wireless. Only in a few places has Diplomatic Wireless been installed,though the number is growing. The great majority of telegrams and messages toand from Foreign Service posts are transmitted by the Diplomatic WirelessService. This Service was formed in April 1947 by the transfer of a militarycommunications organisation to the Civil Service. Since then it has been a CivilService Department under the Foreign Office with the Director of Communicationsat the Foreign Office as its head. Apart from its basic work of transmission, theService installs and maintains its own equipment which, in some instances, it hasalso designed and produced. It operates three broadcasting stations overseas forrelaying B.B.C. programmes; design work is being carried out on a furtherstation. Another branch of the Service the Foreign Service TechnicalMaintenance Service (F.S.T.M.S.) is concerned with the technical security of premises occupied by British Government Departments and agencies in the
United Kingdom and throughout the world. It is also concerned with Canadianoverseas missions and a number of the overseas missions of other commonwealth governments. Resident Maintenance Engineers are provided for principal foreign service posts and certain Commonwealth Relations Office establishments overseas.Telephone systems are installed and maintained at posts abroad.154. The total number of staff in the Diplomatic Wireless Service is 1,349;of these, 1,051 are non-industrial civil servants. 307 are members of Branch Tof the Foreign Service. This Branch was formed in 1959 when residentMaintenance Engineers of the F.S.T.M.S. were re-certificated into the foreign service.155.  Branch T is at present divided into eight grades:Grade	Number of Posts	Salary ScaleTl (Wireless Officer)	10	 1,682- 1,852T2 (Wireless Officer)	12	 1,507- 1,656T3 (Supervisor Operator/Technician)	43	 1,270- 1,479T4 (Operator/Technician)	201	 778- l,270TE1 (Engineer/Technician)	-	 1,268- 1,547TE2 (Engineer/Technician)	6	 1,119- 1,268TE3 (Engineer/Technician)	35	 941- 1,119TE4 (Engineer/Technician)	6	 769- l,002Unestablished officers and staff in other Diplomatic Wireless Service sections,including overseas broadcasting stations staff, are normally regarded as beingattached to Branch T when serving abroad. It is the usual practice at the close of each tour abroad for an officer to return to Britain for a spell of duty. This isnecessary to bring each officer up to date with technical developments in his field.Double tours at the same post are rare.156. There is considerable competition to join the Diplomatic WirelessService as an operator. Career prospects are better than those available to wirelessoperators elsewhere. The Service is in the happy position of being able to take itspick of recruits; when two or three vacancies were advertised recently nearly 400applications were received.157. We are convinced that present difficulties in communicating speedilyand effectively between posts in Commonwealth and foreign countries and between those posts and Departments in Whitehall must be removed.Contemporary methods and techniques of communication are, however, highlytechnical and we have not thought it desirable to make specific recommendations on how or over what period a unified communications system is to be achieved.There will be problems of technique, management and cost to be considered.We should like, nonetheless, to indicate some aspects which we believe shouldbe taken into account.158. It may well be necessary to increase the number of DiplomaticWireless Service posts overseas where this can be arranged. In certain capital citiespublic communications are notoriously unreliable in times of crisis. There is astrong case for installing Diplomatic Wireless Service in posts where breakdownsin public communications in times of crisis are likely. The value of a Mission is often greatest at times of crisis; it cannot be right to risk having it out ofcommunication and its advice unheard. We think that for this and other reasons,partly economic, partly technical, Diplomatic Wireless Service posts should beextended to cover more posts in the Commonwealth and elsewhere, for example,in South America. This would imply some switch of traffic to Diplomatic WirelessService from commercial channels. The financial consequences of such a movewould need careful study. A unified communications system such as we advocateneed not, however, necessarily carry with it a complete rejection of the use ofcommercial channels.159. Whatever common system of communications is devised for the diplomatic Service, it should be capable, as far as is technically possible, of beinglinked with any other communications systems which may be found necessary inother Departments, for example, the Ministry of Defence.160. The unified communications system would be run, we envisage, bymembers of the &quot; Communications Branch &quot; of the new Diplomatic Service. This
Branch should be formed broadly on the basis of the present Diplomatic WirelessService. We think, however, that the name &quot; Diplomatic Wireless Service &quot; mightwell continue.161. It was put to us that improvements were necessary in certain aspects ofthe conditions of service of the present members of the Diplomatic Wireless Service.We have considered these in some detail and set out below the changes weshould like to see implemented. These changes should be made when the newCommunications Branch is formed.162. As a general principle, conditions of service and allowances for membersof the Communications Branch should be equated with those of non-representationalofficers in corresponding salary bands in the present Branch B, wherever this is practicable. We say &quot; wherever this is practicable &quot; advisedly, as any attempt toapply this principle rigidly throughout would lead to anomalies. We doubt, forexample, whether such a formula ought to be applied to the question of leaveentitlement. We believe, however, that the Administration of the Diplomatic service will be able to base acceptable allowances and conditions of service on this general principle.163. On the evidence put forward to us, we feel that some improvement in the&quot; manning &quot; position is called for. There are at present twelve one-man posts wherethe officer is on call 24 hours a day and is unable to take local leave. In somelarger stations there is a 24-hour commitment and regular shift work is essential.Coupled with leave difficulties, which, we were told, are caused by too rigid staffceilings, these long hours without relief lead to a higher rate of sick leave and this in turn places a greater strain on the remaining officers. The unified Service should do everything possible, either by way of regrading or increasing its staff complement,to minimise these problems. It may not, we suspect, be possible to do away entirely with one-man posts. In such one-man posts as remain, however, arrangements should be made to ensure that at least one other member of the staff is able to operate the equipment.164. There are other posts where at certain times of the year wireless operatorsare under-employed through no fault of their own. It was submitted to us thatmorale might be improved if other duties could be found for such officers at times when they are under-employed which, without interfering with normal DiplomaticWireless Service work, would help to bring them into the general life of the Embassy.We recommend that these officers should be given, to the extent practicable, theopportunity to undertake other additional duties. We recognise, however, that security problems may restrict the range of possible jobs.165. We heard complaints about promotion prospects. It was suggested tous that for Branch T officers of real ability a promotion outlet ought to be foundin the Foreign Service Communications Organisation at present staffed entirely by Home Civil Servants. This would ease promotion in the lower grades where thepresent structure is such that the majority of officers of T4 rank are likely to remainin this grade throughout their careers. The promotion pyramid in Branch T is flatand where outlets can be found these must be welcome. It must be remembered,however, that outside the Diplomatic Wireless Service most appointments open toWireless Operators offer virtually no promotion at all. These promotion problemsapply with at least equal force to the specialist cypher staff. Here the nature of thework imposes limits on career structure.166. We also received representations about the present Postings andPromotions Boards. These Boards are composed of Home Civil Servants and it wassuggested that they should include serving Branch T officers with recent overseasexperience. An alternative proposal was that the posting and promotion of Branch Tofficers should be transferred to the Administration of the Foreign Service as awhole. We cannot endorse either of these proposals, though the latter might bere considered when the joint Administration of a unified Service settles down. we hope, however, that the appointment as Chief Establishment Officer of the diplomatic Wireless Service of a man with considerable experience both overseas and in the Personnel Department of the Foreign Office will help to overcome present difficulties.167. A special problem arises on F.S.T.M.S. Engineers and Inspectors. Theyhave to possess a high standard of technical knowledge and exercise a wide range of skills. They have to be discreet, security-minded, able to stand strain and to fitinto Embassy communities overseas. Many are required to spend each year four
periods abroad of approximately six weeks unaccompanied by their families. Theyexperience a combination of unusual conditions of life not met with by other civilservants on periods of overseas duty. Special allowances have been introduced byway of compensation but the life is disagreeable and unpopular and there is a highwastage among recruits. We understand that wastage has been as high as 75%over the past five years. The establishment of Inspectors is seriously below strength.This seems to us particularly unfortunate in view of the highly confidential and essential work which members of the F.S.T.M.S., particularly the Inspectors, haveto perform. It was put to us that it has become difficult to retain the services of qualified and reliable men on the present pay scales, and that some furtherinducement was necessary. The figures for recruitment and wastage suggest that either pay will have to be improved or a special allowance instituted. The latter maybe preferable. We believe that something must be done at an early date.
CHAPTER THREETHE WORK OF THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE168. Earlier (para. 27) we listed the principal categories of work on whichthe three overseas Services are now engaged and which will become theresponsibility of the Diplomatic Service we propose. We now consider these tasksin more detail. We wish, however, to preface our observations with some comments of more general application. We look first at requirements for representation andthen at the problems of specialisation and of controlling the volume and directionof the work of the new Service as a whole.Representation169. British Ambassadors and High Commissioners overseas have broadlytwo inter-related sets of functions. The first is to be the main point of contact withthe overseas governments to which they are accredited and the principal channelthrough which intergovernmental exchanges of view take place and negotiations are conducted. These functions are essentially &quot; diplomatic&quot; in origin and character. The other set of functions, mainly &quot; consular &quot; in origin, relates to theprotection of British subjects and their overseas interests, including commercial interests. Because the two sets of functions increasingly impinge on one another and require unified treatment, particularly by Heads of Mission, most countries have found it necessary to bring them within the scope of a single Service. We aresure this is right.170. In order to carry out its &quot;diplomatic&quot; and its &quot; consular-cum-commercial &quot; activities effectively, a Mission must be in close touch with what maybe called the &quot; points of power &quot; in overseas countries. In some countries this meansmaintaining contacts at all levels in the governmental machine and outside it;issues of some substance can often be settled well below the top political level. Butin some countries, particularly the newer countries where democracy does not existor is not at all advanced, effective power is held by a handful of people.Representations, if they are to have any chance of being fruitful, must in thesecountries be made at the top and nearly always by the Head of Mission himself.171. Representation as a means of acquiring a position of influence ispre-eminently a function of the Ambassador or High Commissioner himself. Thisis why his personality is so important. If he is not known and respected by thosein positions of power and authority, not only will his own prestige and influence and that of his Mission suffer but that of his country too. If the reputation of anEmbassy is high, its work becomes more effective since there are greater opportunities to acquire information and to exert influence.172. This raises the question of representational entertainment about whichwe fear there is still no small degree of public uncertainty and misunderstanding.We have therefore looked into this question with care. In our view, representationalentertainment remains indispensable as a means of acquiring and maintaining thecontacts necessary to advance British policies and protect British interests. It has apart to play in making policies informed, effective and persuasive. Members ofthe Government and Parliament of the country to which a Head of Mission isaccredited as well as leaders in all walks of life ought to come to look on theBritish Embassy or High Commission as the house of a friend. There is nosubstitute for this kind of personal relationship; this applies even in countries whereofficial relationships are easy. In countries where there are difficulties, it is the task of the Head of Mission and his staff to make these difficulties less. Representationalentertainment may be among the best means open to them.173. Contact cannot be confined to formal meetings. Receptions, luncheonsand dinners given by a Head of Mission allow him and his staff to get to knowthose with whom they have to do business. Such occasions also provideOpportunities of learning about local developments, attitudes and policies. Theycan create the right atmosphere for explaining British policies and outlooks. The
most significant advantage these occasions offer is the opportunity of winning theconfidence and goodwill of influential citizens in countries overseas. Well-directedhospitality is rarely wasted.174. A Head of Mission and his staff should travel widely and be preparedto make public appearances throughout the country. It is not enough to represent;one must be seen to represent. A Head of Mission must be present, sometimes withhis staff, at a number of official ceremonies. Attendance at these cartnot be avoidedwithout giving offence and occupies a great deal of time. But this need not be lost.These occasions can lead to useful contacts which can be consolidated later.However, it must be recognised that the heavy social life at many posts abroadimposes a burden on senior officers and particularly on their wives. They entertainand are entertained not because they want to do so but because it is part ofthe job.175. In major capital cities there may now be over a hundred foreignEmbassies. Each celebrates its own National Day with official functions to which local dignitaries and diplomats are invited as a matter of course. Attendance at these functions has become a burden for senior diplomatists of all countries.176. Some reduction in the extent of National Day celebrations is desirable.We should not wish to see the end of National Day parties to which only the nationals of the host country are invited. Members of local British communitiesoverseas look forward to the celebration of The Queen&apos;s Birthday at the british embassy or High Commission. But we think there should be some limitation ofNational Day celebrations-given by diplomatists outside their own countries fornationals other than their own. This is not something which could be achieved byunilateral action. Any limitation would have to be negotiated on an internationalbasis. Any initiative to this end should be welcomed.177. The Head of Mission and his staff will need to keep in close touchwith local British businessmen and other leading British subjects abroad. Theyentertain prominent British visitors including Ministers, Members of Parliament,officials, Service chiefs, businessmen, Trade Unionists and journalists. The visitorsnormally wish to meet their local counterparts and, in arranging this, the Missioncan often take the opportunity to widen its contacts.178. It is sometimes argued that, if the Head of Mission himself entertainswidely, this should be enough and that there is no need for his staff to do muchentertaining. We do not accept this view. For a Mission or Consular post to be fully effective, all representational staff must seek to make the maximum impactin their own fields and at their own levels. If this is not done, it will not bepossible for the staff to put together a comprehensive view of trends of opinion,to report accurately on developments or to get British views and policies fully understood and accepted by a wide range of influential people. When it isnecessary to go into action to put over a particular British policy, a co-ordinatedoperation should be undertaken by the staff at all appropriate levels. exchanges of hospitality develop contacts and friendships essential to successful diplomaticwork.179. We have heard it said that it is a waste of time to entertain diplomaticcolleagues. The work of a Mission must, of course, be primarily directed towardsthe citizens of the country in which it is established, but it is essential to co-operate with diplomatic colleagues. They are an essential and reliable source of information and guidance. They, too, are professional observers of the local scene.Specialisation180. One of the principal tests of an effective Diplomatic Service is itsability to find the right man with the right qualities, experience and knowledge and send him to the right place at the right time. This is a particularly difficulttest for any overseas representational service to pass. Probably no questionaffecting representational work is argued over more hotly than what is the best means of solving the problem of specialisation.181. The new Service will require to have at its disposal a wide range ofabilities. One obvious need is for proficiency in languages. Another is for deepand intimate knowledge not only of individual countries but of areas of the world
where there are common attitudes, common problems and common ways of doingbusiness. A third need is for sufficient knowledge and experience of the specialranges of work which members of an overseas representational service have tocarry out. Certain items of knowledge and certain techniques are especiallyvaluable in officers doing political work; other special skills are needed by thosedoing information work, economic work, commercial work, consular work,administration work, accounts and registry work.182. The trend of development in the overseas representational servicesof our own country and of other countries in the last forty years has been consistently away from separate specialised and localised services such as theformer regional consular services. Britain is almost alone in continuing to divide the world into two parts on a geographical and political basis for purposes of overseas representation. We have already drawn attention to the disadvantages of having two overseas representational services and have recommended theirintegration (para. 44).183. The earlier separate specialist services were able to build up a high degree of intimate knowledge of the local scene but they were not without theirdisadvantages. First, they were not able to deploy their expert staff in other thana rigid and narrow system. In consequence, it was not always as easy for thestaff to acquire perspective and breadth of vision as it was for them to gain in depth of knowledge. Second, the expert services were not always large enough toprovide a viable career structure.184. International politics are by nature unstable and the impact of brokeninternational relationships and changed political circumstances on a smallregional service could be devastating. The former China Consular Service maybe cited as an example. Our wide representation in China of pre-war days hasnow been reduced to one post only. The members of the China Consular service would have faced grave career problems if it had not proved possible to absorbthem into the wider Foreign Service. A larger service is more flexible and canadjust itself to changed circumstances with less pain and hardship. Reducedcommitments in one part of the world or one section of work can be used to helpmeet increased demands elsewhere. Third, the world is now much smaller than it wasand events are moving much more quickly. What happens in one part of theworld reacts intimately and immediately everywhere else. An area expert with little or no experience outside his area of specialisation is of less value than onewhose horizons have been widened by service elsewhere. Artificial barriers canbe an impediment to the appointment of the best man for the job. It can inpresent circumstances make excellent sense to deploy an Arabic specialist in washington, an expert in Communist ideology in Latin America or South-east asia, an officer with African experience in New York or a Chinese speaker inBangkok. At least, there must be the possibility of making such dispositionsquickly and easily.185. We do not believe that to re-create a series of small expert services would serve present purposes. Even if it were desirable, it would certainly notbe possible. For one thing, such services would have great difficulty in attractinggood recruits in the numbers required for life-long service in restrictedgeographical areas. For another, we are in no doubt that any return to smallspecialist services would be strongly opposed by the staff.186. This does not mean that we think specialisation has evolved perfectly,or even satisfactorily, in the Foreign and Commonwealth Services since the war.With hindsight it can be said that the reformers of the Foreign Service in 1943were less successful in dealing with the problem of specialisation than they werein most other directions. They were abundantly right in wanting to give everyonean equal chance of getting to the top, in aiming at greater flexibility and in seeking to create a Service with an identity of its own and a strong esprit de corps.But their proposal that &quot; every officer of the combined Service will be called uponto serve in consular and commercial diplomatic as well as in diplomatic posts and in the Foreign Office &quot;* carried with it, or was widely misinterpreted ascarrying with it, the implication that everyone would do everything and becomeexpert in everything. In practice, this could only result in their not being expertin anything. There was undoubtedly some loss at first in regional, linguistic and* Cmd. 6420, para. 6.CONFIDENTIAL3610 F 2
functional expertise. This was accentuated by the need in the immediate post-war years to make up quickly for the cessation of recruitment during the war and to resume normal representation in many countries where it had been cut off orcurtailed. New recruits had therefore to be set to work at once with a minimum oftraining or with none at all.187. The Foreign Office soon recognised that a new theory of specialisationwas needed and has gradually evolved a more realistic policy. The object nowadaysis still to produce &quot; general-purpose &quot; officers but to give them at the same timethe opportunity to acquire one or more specialist qualifications. These are eitherregional and linguistic or functional. Thus, breadth of view and of experience iscombined with specialist knowledge. In order to meet its language requirements,the Foreign Service has made a practice of training about half its Branch Aentrants and some of its Branch B entrants in &quot; hard &quot; languages each year. Giventhe general background of expanding commitments and shortage of manpower,this often represented an act of self-denial. The Foreign Service now disposes of168 officers who have a knowledge of Arabic, 123 of Russian, 62 of Japanese,55 of Chinese, 46 of Persian, 32 of Turkish and 30 of Polish. A stricter test isthe number of officers who have not only passed one of the Civil service commission^ language examinations and have qualified for a language allowancebut have kept their knowledge up to an approved standard. These numbers are:Arabic 94, Russian 27, Japanese 28, Chinese 14, Persian 16, Turkish 5, Polish 5.188. Specialisation has become a serious problem for the CommonwealthService. In one sense, the Commonwealth itself has been regarded as a form ofspecialisation. The Commonwealth Service has not had the same stimulus as theForeign Service to promote linguistic skills, particularly in &quot; hard &quot; languages. It isstill possible at all Commonwealth posts to transact business in English. Moreover,the Commonwealth Service has not had to undertake commercial work. The objectof the Service was to build up a wide knowledge of the Commonwealth as a whole and to provide officers of wide experience. At small posts especially, all-roundexperience was needed. In its evidence, the Commonwealth Relations Office made it clear that this traditional approach was now having to be substantially modified.The Commonwealth has grown so fast in recent years that the old concept ofregarding it as a specialisation in itself is no longer sufficient. This would be trueeven if the Commonwealth Service were retained as a separate organisation. Thereis already an urgent need in the Commonwealth Service to build up the numberof experts in African and Asian languages and cultures. A start has been made,none too soon, in training a few officers in these languages. The expertise of officersrecruited from H.M. Oversea Civil Service has proved helpful but this barelyscratches the surface of requirements. The real need is to train more young officersin these languages.189. Many of the linguistic and functional specialisations required in commonwealth countries are already of the same kind as are required in foreigncountries; this trend is becoming more marked. We see real advantage in providingfor these specialisations within the same administrative framework. With goodmanagement, there is no reason why this should mean that Commonwealth expertisein the traditional sense need be so dispersed as to be deficient at any Commonwealthpost. The real danger is that, unless rapid progress is made in supplying our missions in Commonwealth countries with more linguistic and functional specialists, ourrepresentation there will become ineffective and out of touch.190. We think it fair to conclude that, in the Foreign Service, the pendulumwas allowed to swing too far away from specialisation in the post-war years, thatthe readjustment now taking place is necessary, has some way to go and shouldbe pressed ahead vigorously. In the Commonwealth Service, the problem ofproviding specialists, except in information work, has not yet been fully tackledand is urgent. In the next ten years or so, requirements for specialisation willcontinue to increase and we recommend that the number of people with specialskills linguistic, regional and functional should be built up, as part of a plannedtraining programme of the combined Service. There will be a special need for those who combine functional skills, for instance in commercial work, with experience of a particular region and knowledge of its language.191. A major effort in organisation is called for. There must be a diligentand unremitting process of career planning. Selection for specialist training should
be on the basis of aptitude but everyone should be encouraged, indeed required,to acquire at least one specialisation. The number of skills which should be acquired by any one officer should be related to the need to ensure that the diplomatic service secures reasonable value for its training efforts in terms of his subsequentservice at posts where a specialist is required. We would regard it as reasonable,generally speaking, to require officers to spend at least half of their careers inthe area or subject of their specialisations.192. At the same time, the period of consecutive service in any oneappointment should be lengthened. There has been a tendency for staff to be moved from one post to another too fast. This is costly, inefficient and unsettling to anofficer and his family. There must be exceptions but, in general, we think a postis likely to need a new man and an officer is likely to need to be faced with newproblems only after four or five years.193. Area specialisation involves not only learning a language but living inan area long enough to gain the confidence of the local people. A specialist may therefore have to spend much of his career in some of the less pleasant parts ofthe world. We hope this will be borne in mind in considering our recommendations on conditions of service.194. We believe that, in addition to having career officers with specialistlinguistic and functional skills, most major posts should have a &quot; local expert&quot;.Such officers can be invaluable in providing continuity, local knowledge andcontacts. Recruitment of such officers is inevitably somewhat fortuitous. But where an appointment proves possible, this should be welcomed. We do not, however, thinkit desirable to rely exclusively on the &quot;local expert&quot;; he should be one of an&quot; expert &quot; team composed mainly of career service officers.Volume and Direction of Work195. If the changes we propose are carried out, Britain will have a first-classinstrument for the conduct of her overseas policies. But any instrument can onlyaccomplish efficiently a certain volume of work and no more.196. The tasks which might be given to the new Diplomatic Service arelimitless. There is often no natural or obvious point at which it ceases to beworthwhile for its officers to undertake extra work. Yet some limit must be set to the range of activities which the new Service is required to undertake. otherwise the consequence must be either indefinite expansion, at the expense of quality,or the inability to give enough attention to the issues which matter most. neither of these possibilities can be contemplated.197. The problem of controlling the volume of work is inseparable from thatof ensuring that what is done is purposeful. Most of those engaged on policy work,especially at home, seem to be overburdened. This may to some extent be inevitablebut the pressure might be eased if a more stringent view were taken of what is tobe considered essential. There must be a limit to the amount of work which is worth the expense from the point of view of the taxpayer. The criterion must always be whether the work advances British interests or is required to enable us to fulfil our responsibilities. Sometimes, it seemed to us, work in the overseas Services was being undertaken not for these reasons but because as part of a ritualised diplomatic orbureaucratic process it was difficult to refuse. If no clear line is drawn and heldat the point where substantial British interests and responsibilities cease, minutingand consultation will become increasingly unprofitable. They will amount to littlemore than marginal comments on events which we are either powerless to affector with which we have insufficient cause to be concerned.198. Consultations with other governments and representations to them should wherever possible be confined to subjects which are of demonstrable concern to Britain and are likely to be in our power to influence by diplomatic means.Our representatives overseas should be kept well informed on all matters but theyshould not be asked or encouraged to use up time, energy and good will trying to influence other governments on issues which do not affect us.199. There will be difficulties of interpretation. These can perhaps best be illustrated in the matter of report writing. A report should not be offered or called for simply because the subject is historically or academically interesting in itself or because similar work has been undertaken in similar circumstances in the past. One
touchstone should be whether there is any direct British interest which would belikely to suffer if the information is not reported through official channels. On this basis reports on political and economic developments in other countries would beregarded as necessary when these could be shown to have a significant effect on ourown political or trading position. But there is a second criterion. We are a majorpower with far-flung responsibilities and interests. We are a member of theCommonwealth and of a global network of alliances and commitments. We are apermanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations. In consequence,we have a responsibility to take a position on issues of international importance.In practice, therefore, we need to be well informed about a wide range of worldquestions, including many which on the surface may appear to be of little concern to us. Without this information, we should not be able to exercise the degree of influence which we ought to exercise and of which we are capable. There are manyoverseas issues of general background interest about which we need to be informed,for example, the colour problem in the United States, apartheid policy in SouthAfrica, the position of former Nazis in Germany, the &quot;chicken war&quot; between theUnited States and the European Common Market countries, the Kashmir dispute,Indo-Chinese border troubles, unrest in Vietnam, the question of birth control inpopulous Asian countries or the state of Sino-Soviet relations. We cannot affordas a nation to be ignorant or out of touch with any of these issues.200. Nevertheless, there is scope for some reduction in the present volume of report writing. Those who initiate or call for reports must discipline themselves toask first why a report is necessary at all. If a report is necessary, its justificationshould be clear to anyone who reads it. The emphasis should be on ad hoc reportingtailored to the need of an occasion rather than on routine reports at pre-ordainedintervals. Particular restraint should be shown in issuing standing instructions forannual or periodic reports. We should endorse such restraint even if it means someinconvenience to would-be recipients. Departments in Whitehall or Members ofParliament may sometimes have to be told that information for which they askis not immediately available or not obtainable without an unwarrantable expenditureof time. There are occasions when Ministers and senior officials are asked to comment on or give information about events which in any real sense are onlymarginal to British interests, activities and responsibilities. In such cases, it shouldnot be considered impolite either to reply in the briefest of terms or to disclaimresponsibility entirely.201. Some curtailment of departmental minuting is also desirable. So-called&quot; ideal minutes &quot; which summarise a situation for a Minister or senior official and recommend a course of action will always be necessary. The kind of minuting whichwe think could be reduced is that which in effect only summarises or repeats thetenor and conclusions of the report it discusses. Formal reports from overseas postsare now accompanied by their own summaries. If, therefore, there is nothing to besaid about an incoming despatch other than that one agrees with it and that no immediate action is called for there should be no shame in saying no more than that.202. One of the most exacting aspects of work on international affairs isthe high degree of speed and accuracy required. It is inescapable that much of thework of the overseas Departments and Services has to be undertaken at high speed.International events take place with great rapidity; news of them travels fast;and there are dead-lines to meet. Speed must not, however, become a fetish. issues which are not of the highest urgency should not be treated as if they were. nor should speed be achieved at the expense of accuracy. If unreasonable speed isdemanded, particularly when there is no real urgency, the quality of policyrecommendations may suffer and so may the quality of the decisions which are based upon them.203. We are disturbed by the extent to which senior officers in the gradesbetween Permanent Under-Secretary and Head of Department or assistant secretary appear to be rushed off their feet and caught up in a ceaseless round of discussions on day-to-day problems. Our fear is not just that these officersmay not be able long to withstand the pace at which they are working; our majorworry is that there is some maldistribution of function. Under-Secretaries may,in effect, be usurping the proper functions of their subordinates, particularly thoseof Heads of Departments. Whilst Under-Secretaries are busily engaged in tasks which, if we are right, could well be done by Heads of Departments, some ofthat work which Under-Secretaries can do best may not be getting done at all.
CONFIDENTIAL $g   47We see a particular problem about the Deputy Under-Secretaries of State. these officers, whose functions correspond in many ways to those of members of theboard of a major industrial company, ought to have time to think about profitablepolicy trends in their areas, to maintain touch with outside bodies such as the universities and learned associations and generally to act in a supervisory role to guide, to stimulate and to restrain. If, however, they are too much caught upin the hurly-burly of day-to-day business, the consequences cannot be good forthem personally, for their subordinates, for the higher management of the office or for the steady and sensible evolution of policy. The art of delegation is in someways more difficult to practise in the public service than it is in industry.Nevertheless, a way ought to be found of returning to the tradition wherebyDeputy Under-Secretaries and Assistant Under-Secretaries keep relatively clearof detailed current work not involving changes of policy. This would give themtime to think and plan on a wider and more leisurely basis. The main method of achieving this will be to allow, and indeed expect, a wider measure of delegation to Heads of Departments. A corollary must be the appointment as Heads of department of officers capable of taking on the extra responsibility left to them.Ministers will also have to be ready to call more on Heads of Department for advice.204. If this change in emphasis is brought about, Under-Secretaries willhave more time to devote to another aspect of their work which we think somewhatneglected at present. This is the need for senior officers to pay more frequentroutine visits to the overseas posts within their parish. In this way, a closerunderstanding can be built up between headquarters and the men in the fieldOn broad policy aims and means of achieving them. When possible,Under-Secretaries should take the opportunity of such visits to attend meetingsof Heads of Mission organised on a regional basis. Meetings of this sort have,we think, a useful part to play.205. We have drawn attention to the need for the new Diplomatic service to be highly flexible and well adapted to meet rapidly changing requirements.We believe some new mechanism is required to assess each year whether thedistribution of effort at posts throughout the world corresponds to needs. from such an assessment detailed action for the redeployment of resources would flownaturally. We have studied several schemes but it has proved difficult to find-an acceptable one. Some demanded a procedure so elaborate and detailed as tobe either unworkable or not worth the time and effort involved. Others fell intothe danger of purporting to be scientific in their methods of evaluation when in fact they could not be so.206. We wish to recommend a scheme which is simple and unpretentious.Each Head of Mission should be invited annually to give his views andrecommendations on the work and staffing of his post. Essentially, he would be consulted on two points. First, he would be asked whether, in his view, his mission was having to undertake work which was not necessary and ought to be dropped and whether there was any work which ought to be undertaken but was not being done. Second, he would be asked what staffing changes he would recommend if his proposals for alterations in the work load were accepted. such recommendations from Heads of Mission throughout the world would beconsidered by the relevant geographical and administration departments and related to an annual review of the priorities in specific countries or areas. this review of priorities would be conducted at the highest level in the overseas departments which would, where appropriate, consult other Departments in whitehall. In the light of the priorities thus agreed, the administration departments would be in a position to carry out those recommendations by Heads of Missionwhich were consistent with the agreed broad pattern of emphasis.207. Reluctant as we are to institute a new annual report and review, webelieve this one to be necessary to ensure the correct orientation of the work and deployment of the staff. It would also be of great assistance to Inspectors intheir visits abroad.&quot;Political&quot; Work: its nature, conduct and organisation208. &quot; Political&quot; work is easier to define by saying what it is not ratherthan what it is. The description &quot;political&quot; work is wrongly used if it impliesthe existence of a separate area of work in which &quot; pure policy &quot; can be pursued
irrespective of economic and other considerations. The fact is that all the workof the overseas representational services at home and abroad is directed to political ends. From this point of view there is nothing to be gained fromattempting to make an antithesis between &quot; political&quot; work and economic work or between &quot;political&quot; work and information policy work. Any major policyproblem in the international field has economic and public relations aspects.Similarly, any important economic problem has political and public relationsaspects. All aspects of international problems are interrelated and foreign policyquestions are essentially indivisible. It was upon this principle that the unification of the Foreign Service in 1943 was based, rightly in our view. When we speak of&quot; political &quot; work we must not be taken as implying that it is desirable, or indeedpossible, to deal sensibly with the &quot; political&quot; strands of international problems in isolation from the relevant considerations of economics, finance, defence or public relations.209. There is, however, an organisational context in which the phrase&quot; political work &quot; can be both legitimate and useful. In this, the phrase is shorthandfor the broad responsibilities which fall to the &quot; geographical &quot; and &quot; functional &quot;departments of the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices in London.The present grouping of work in the two Offices is set out at Annex H. the parallel abroad is the division of work between the Chanceries or Political Sectionsof Embassies, High Commissions and Delegations and the other sections of theseMissions. Here again, &quot; political&quot; work does not denote a closely defined area ofwork so much as that work which, organisationally, has been kept in a centralsection of the Mission and not allocated to the commercial, information or otherspecialised sections.210. The ability to see and understand the political implications of events and developments is an essential qualification for any officer in a senior grade ina diplomatic Service. Without this, his work will be in vain. It is not enough fora man to be a specialist in commercial or information work if he does not alsopossess an alert and informed political awareness. Officers who work in&quot; political&quot; departments of the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations offices and in Political Sections or Chanceries abroad have a particular need to possessthis faculty. They should be quick in recognising political implications and deftin handling them. They should have to a special degree the flair for recognising the human factor in international relationships. The &quot; political touch &quot;, togetherwith the knowledge of places, people and techniques which is necessary to sustainand inform it, is no less of a specialisation than those other types of skill whichare more readily recognised as specialist. This is the central skill of an efficientDiplomatic Service.211. Since all the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth Services ispolitical in purpose, we cannot consider the organisation and conduct of&quot; political &quot; work in isolation. What is true of &quot; political &quot; work is also true, to agreater or lesser degree, of work in other specialised fields. The practice ofgrouping work together on a geographical basis has been shown to be the most practical way of handling the bulk of the problems dealt with in the foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices. These geographical departments should sofar as possible be responsible for the whole range of our relations with thecountries in their parish. Their duties must include, and accord a prominent place to, our economic relations with the countries in their areas. In the Foreign Office,geographical departments already have responsibility of this kind. In thepast, some geographical departments may have tended to shuffle off to continue departments within the Office responsibility for economic workin their areas or to give it a lower priority than it deserves. This tendency has,we believe, been greatly reduced if not altogether eliminated as a result of the unified approach to foreign affairs introduced by the 1943 Reforms. Geographicaldepartments now contain officers who have served in economic and commercialposts. It would help to remove any lingering misapprehensions if care were taken not to refer to geographical departments as &quot; political&quot; departments. the description &quot; political&quot; departments can mislead outsiders and, on occasion,members of those departments about the scope of their responsibilities.212. In the Commonwealth Relations Office, the practice is for eachgeographical department to be matched by separate Economic RelationsDepartments, each with special responsibility for economic matters in particular areas of the world. If, in this way, geographical departments are absolved or
debarred from handling economic problems directly, they may tend to form anunbalanced view of our bilateral and regional relationships and to underestimatethe importance of trade and economic developments. We therefore recommendthat, as opportunity offers, the Commonwealth Relations Office should reorganiseits work so as to place responsibility for bilateral and regional economic matters within geographical departments.213. Even if most economic matters are handled on a geographical basis, itwill still be necessary for the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices tohave economic departments to deal with economic matters which cannot be handled bilaterally or regionally but have to be treated on a multilateral orcommodity basis. Such departments can also usefully act as a clearing house for economic information, give advice to geographical departments and thus help toensure that what we do in one part of the world makes sense in relation to whatis being done elsewhere. But primary responsibility for dealing with economic matters within their areas must lie with geographical departments.214. In addition to geographical and economic departments there must bespecialist functional departments. There is, for example, a General Department inthe Foreign Office which has among its duties an oversight of matters affectinginternational transport, telecommunications and fisheries. Such departments are clearly necessary; otherwise, it would not be possible to ensure that what was donein a specialised field in one part of the world was done in full knowledge of whatwas going on elsewhere. Separate departments with world-wide responsibilities,in matters such as disarmament, are also necessary. Equally, the &quot; hiving off&quot; ofinformation work in specialist departments is justified provided, as is the case atpresent, the Information Policy Departments of the Foreign Office and commonwealth Relations Office are themselves organised on a geographical basis and act in close co-operation with geographical departments. Again, it is necessaryto have departments responsible for, dealing with international bodies ormultilateral organisations such as the United Nations and the European economic community. However, care must be taken throughout to avoid extending the sphere of specialised departments in such a way as to diminish the responsibility and effectiveness of geographical departments. If the work in relation to aparticular area of the world increases, we should prefer to see the geographicaldepartment concerned strengthened or, if necessary, divided into two departments.This is better than the alternative of &quot; hiving off &quot; into functional departmentswork which belongs essentially to our relations with countries within the jurisdiction of the geographical departments.215. Whilst it makes sense for the work of the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices to be organised primarily on a geographical basis, a different set of arguments prevails when assessing the best way to organise work at overseas posts. Since normally each Embassy or High Commission is concerned primarily with one overseas country only, the Head of Mission and his senior staff areautomatically in a position to survey the whole pattern of our relationships withthat country. At posts abroad, therefore, the organisation of work at subordinatelevels should be such as to provide the greatest degree of specialisation compatible with an economical and flexible use of manpower. It would not be possible without an unjustifiable increase in the size of staffs to split off every identifiable group ofwork and allocate it to separate sections or specialist officers. The smaller the post,the less scope there is for specialisation of this kind. In most cases it will besufficient to have a separate Economic and Commercial Section and separateInformation, Consular and Administration Sections and to concentrate all thework not allocated to them in the Chancery or Political Section. If the Chanceryis of any size, each member of it should be allocated his own subjects so that hemay become expert in them. However, no attribute of Chancery work is morestriking than its diversity. The aim will always have to be to rely for most matterson a Chancery staffed with officers who have been given the opportunity to acquire a good knowledge of the particular country, its language, interests, politics andpersonalities and combine this with an experience of proved diplomatic techniques.The quality of such officers will always be more important than their numbers.Their role is fundamental to the success of a Mission. It is upon them that theHead of Mission must principally rely for co-ordinated advice based on all theknowledge available in the Mission as a whole.216. At Embassies and Foreign Office Missions overseas it is standardpractice for an officer to hold the appointment of &quot; Head of Chancery &quot;. This
officer combines with his duties as Head of the political section of the Missionthe responsibility of co-ordinating, under the direction of the Head of Mission,the work of the post as a whole. A good Head of Chancery is the best guarantee of the cohesion of a Mission and its work. This system greatly lightens the burden on the Head of Mission, for whom the Head of Chancery acts as a kind ofadjutant. The fact that the Head of Chancery is Head of the political section doesnot imply that commercial or other types of work are inferior. It is simply thatthe diverse nature of the responsibilities of the Chancery makes it more convenientand practicable for its head, rather than for any other officer, to play theco-ordinating role.217. The practice of having a Head of Chancery should be introduced at high Commission posts. We received evidence that this innovation would be welcome and would add to efficiency.218. We should not wish to prescribe exactly the extent to which a Head ofChancery should be required as part of his job as co-coordinator to superviseadministration and welfare work. This will vary from post to post and from timeto time, depending on the size of the post, the pressure of political, administration and other work, and the seniority, skill and experience of the officers concerned.We should prefer, however, not to see busy Heads of Chancery too burdened withdetailed duties of administration. This, we recognise, could mean the appointmentof a more experienced Administration Officer at certain posts. The Head ofChancery should, of course, supervise and co-ordinate administration. But it willnot always be right for him to undertake the duties of direct administration himself.Policy Planning219. In the past some policy problems have not been anticipated or preparedfor sufficiently. This is easy to say but difficult to legislate for. Some situations areunpredictable and surprises cannot be eliminated. Nevertheless, many issues canbe foreseen at least in outline and it is better to prepare for these in advance than to improvise when they have arisen. Some of the most intractable internationalissues in which we have been involved in the last two decades could, in our view,have been handled better if their implications had been explored more fully inadvance. It will probably not be contested that more could have been done wellin advance before Abadan and Suez to study the merits of the various courses ofaction open to us in certain eventualities and to secure broad policy directives.More comprehensive studies might have been begun earlier of the advantages and disadvantages of going into Europe and the tactical means of achieving whateverpolicy was decided upon. To give a further example, more interdepartmentalplanning might have been undertaken of the likely international reactions to theformation of the Federation of Malaysia and the Southern Arabian federation and how to deal with them.220. The difficulty as a rule does not lie in having to foresee that a problem is likely to arise. The difficulty in the first instance is much more one of machinery.First, there has to be a mechanism by which to select the most important fromthe many possible subjects for policy planning studies. Second, a means has to befound of providing staff who are free enough from current work to be able togerminate and develop ideas without being so remote from current work that theirthinking becomes too academic. Third, policy planning papers must be studied and taken into account by senior officers with the firm responsibility for takingeffective further action. Fourth, there has to be inter-departmental machinery toco-ordinate studies in the field of foreign policy with defence policy and financial policy. Finally, there must be a means of bringing these studies andrecommendations on them to Ministers.221. These are the necessary parts of an effective apparatus for what is called&quot; policy planning &quot;. In fact, &quot; planning &quot; is probably a misnomer for this work sofar as the Foreign and Commonwealth Services are concerned. What they normallydeal with are not plans having the precision of military plans but studies orappreciations of likely future problems. These studies have of course some of theattributes of detailed plans. They are not simply interesting essays but are designedto lead to broad practical conclusions.222. A formal planning section in the Foreign Office has existed since 1957.A planning unit in the Commonwealth Relations Office was started in 1959. Since
511961, the Planning Section in the Foreign Office has been closely integrated withthe department dealing with European organisations, including N.A.T.O. It was thought that, if the Planning Section was not to be divorced from all currentresponsibilities, the right link for it to have was with the department concernedwith European political and military affairs. It was also arranged for the PlanningSection to be responsible for &quot;co-ordination&quot;: this includes such tasks asorganising briefs for Ministerial visits and speeches.223. We have no doubt that the planning staff ought to be relieved of theseco-ordination functions. And we are not convinced that planning work ought tobe kept in double harness with work connected with European organisations. Ifpolicy planning work is combined with the work of an executive department itsuffers in two ways. In practice priority is given to current work and the views ofthe planners can become coloured by the special responsibilities of the executivedepartment to which they are attached. We are therefore glad to know that theForeign Office intends to free its planning staff from responsibility for current policyproblems.224. The planners must not develop an &quot; ivory tower &quot; mentality. This dangercan be overcome in a number of ways. First, the principal planners should be careerofficers. An experienced general service officer will be less likely to approach his task from too academic a point of view. Second, planning officers should see currenttelegrams and despatches and be brought into office meetings on current aspectsof problems in their field. Otherwise, they will not be fully aware of the flavour ofthe thinking of Ministers and senior officials. This may not be easy to arrange butit should be attempted. Third, the questions for study must be carefully chosenand formulated. The planning staff should not spend too high a proportion oftheir time scanning the horizons of the distant future. In international affairs it ismore profitable to concentrate on problems which are likely to become actualwithintwo to five years rather than on those which are likely to appear in, say, twenty years. Moreover, policy planning papers should not simply be generalisedstatements of British policy in particular fields, as we fear has sometimes been thecase in the past. They should be directed from the outset to answering specificwell-defined questions and should lead to well-defined conclusions.225. Basically, there are two kinds of planning to be done. There is, in thefirst place, direct contingency planning. One example of this is the politico-military-economic work which has been done against the possibility of a squeeze on Berlin.Other examples are the studies which have been made of the consequences of possible changes in the regimes in countries like Iraq, Egypt and Spain. This is atechnique fairly close to military planning. But it is of limited usefulness in the field of foreign policy. It is difficult to foresee all the variables and make assumptionsaccurate enough to justify detailed contingency planning. The second kind ofpolicy planning, and the one we think more useful, attempts to foresee the choiceswith which Britain is likely to be faced at some stage in the future and to consider how we can use the intervening time to place ourselves in the best position to makea final choice when we have to. There is no shortage of subjects on which it would now be valuable to carry out studies and to attempt to formulate broad lines ofpolicy. Wherever possible, the attempt should be made to evaluate in quantitativeas well as qualitative terms the likely consequences of alternative courses of action.Perhaps the classic case at present is our policy towards the European Communities.Is the time coming when we shall be able or anxious to apply again for membership?If so, how will the Communities have developed meanwhile? How can we adjustour policies now so as to leave open the option of joining the Communities and put ourselves in the best position to do so, if we wish, without damaging our short-term interests in the meanwhile?226. Policy planning must be geared in with policy making. In the caseof the Foreign Office, papers produced by the Planning Section should, as atpresent, be submitted to and mainly commissioned by a Steering committee presided over by the Permanent Under-Secretary. This ensures that planning workmeets the requirements and receives the attention of senior officials who are ableto consult Ministers. The planners should be responsible for seeing that anyfurther action is taken on planning papers approved by Ministers and the steering committee, though they will not necessarily carry out the action themselves.227. The planning staff in the Foreign Office consists of a Counsellor, a first Secretary and one other at present. They are, however, able to get help on3610G 2
particular projects from the Foreign Office Research Department, executive^departments in the Foreign Office, planning staff in the Commonwealth relations office and other Government Departments. On some subjects it may be possiblefor executive departments to do much of the drafting. Even so, we doubt whetherthe present planning staff will prove large enough. There are many subjects to tackle and the planning staff will have to maintain closer and more frequent contact with outside experts.228. It will often be valuable to set up panels to study particular projects.Outside experts should be invited to take part in the work of these panels. Whenoutside experts are invited to participate, they must have access to appropriateconfidential information, subject to normal security requirements. Though their work should normally be on a part-time basis, it should not be honorary. Whenappropriate fees are paid the whole relationship is much more business-like.229. An alternative method of harnessing outside knowledge and experience is to organise seminars. A few such seminars have already taken place and, weare glad to know, more are contemplated. A seminar might be organised by theForeign or Commonwealth Relations Offices, by a university faculty or by anon-governmental body such as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, theRoyal Institution, the Institute of Strategic Studies, the Federation of BritishIndustries, the Hispanic Council or the Ditchley Foundation. The essential differencebetween a panel study and a seminar is that in the former the experts co-optedfrom outside take a hand in drafting reports and recommendations, whereas after a seminar it is left to officials to draft their own papers on the basis of the discussion.We believe there will be a place for both study groups and seminars.230. The planning staff at the Commonwealth Relations Office consists of four officers who combine the writing of planning papers with research work.There is already close contact with the planners of the Foreign Office: this shouldbe developed still further. We doubt, however, whether it is right to maintainseparate planning sections in the Foreign Office and in the Commonwealth relations office. We should be happy to see the establishment of a combined PlanningDepartment. This would not undermine the current responsibilities of the foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices as separate Departments of State. It would,however, help greatly to ensure that future policies develop in harmony. It wouldbe specially valuable in relation to regions of the world where the two Officeshave contiguous responsibilities.231. Effective policy planning on most major overseas policy issues cannotbe carried on by the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices alone. nor should departmental planning in other parts of Whitehall be carried out in isolation.We have, therefore, at the risk of straying somewhat beyond our strict terms ofreference, considered the machinery in Whitehall for policy planning in matters affecting overseas policy. We have been particularly concerned with the machineryfor bringing together considerations of foreign policy, defence and finance.232. The 1963 White Paper on Defence Organisation (Cmnd. 2097)foreshadows the creation of a Committee in the Cabinet Office which would haveamong its duties the task of keeping the military plans of the Ministry of defence in line with the planning of the overseas and economic Departments. Such a centralPlanning Committee is to be welcomed so long as it does not become simply aforum where Departments arrive, with the help of a neutral chairman, at thehighest common factor of inter-departmental agreement and no more. If, as wethink it should be, the object of policy planning is not merely prognosis butrecommendations for action and preparations for it, something more dynamicwill be needed than the provision of secretarial services and an umpire. It is easy to get Departments to agree on forecasts of what is likely to happen; what isnecessary, but more difficult, is to get them to agree on what action should betaken in the light of agreed predictions.233. It was put to us that a central Planning Committee in the Cabinet office would need staff of its own, apart from regular Cabinet Office secretarial staff.We agree with this and think that the Planning Committee should be able, and, ifnecessary empowered, to borrow personnel with experience of policy planningfrom other Departments, including the Foreign and Commonwealth RelationsOffices. These officers should have the duty of seeing that planning studies are
Economic and Commercial Work235. Our basic views on economic and commercial work have already beenmade plain. These are that it should be regarded as a first charge on the resourcesof the new Diplomatic Service and recognised by members of that Service as animportant, though not exclusive, specialisation. Members of the Service should begiven special training for economic and commercial work and be reinforced by officers seconded from the Board of Trade and other Departments.236. Economic and commercial work are two sides of the same coin. Anofficer in a commercial appointment overseas is at his most useful in tradepromotion when he has thoroughly grasped the economic background to his work.Equally, an officer reporting on economic developments in a country overseas can easily become academic without the realities of day-to-day commercial and business affairs to guide him. There must be some division of labour between individual officers at a post but we are convinced that it is right in principle for economic and commercial work to be handled in the same section of our overseasMissions.237. Our commercial services overseas must have as their main object the promotion of British exports. This they do mainly by providing firms in britain with information about markets and export opportunities overseas, by supplyingadvice on agents, by publicising British goods and services and, above all, by giving advice and assistance to travelling representatives of British firms. To carryout these tasks successfully, commercial staff overseas need to have a wide circleof acquaintance not only in the world of commerce but in the sphere ofgovernment. They should spend much of their time visiting local firms and trade organisations and seeking out market opportunities for British goods. They must also make it their business to know the ins and outs of local tariff and importregulations. These are the tasks on which the great majority of firms and businessorganisations in this country expect our commercial services overseas to concentrate. We believe this is right.238. The second main task of commercial staff is to keep Whitehallinformed about the economies of countries overseas. In this way, Departments are able to assess the prospects and viability of other countries or groups of countries,to discern broad economic trends and consider their impact on our own positionand policies. Such reporting is essential. It should be designed to interpretdevelopments of political, economic or commercial significance. What is required from posts overseas is not just an assembly of factual material but an attempt toplace what is happening in perspective as seen from their own vantage point.239. It is often said that commercial staff should not become &quot; desk-bound &quot; but should get out into the &quot; market-place&quot; and see people more.This is good advice. The main obstacle is the pressure of the paper work. Muchof this is inescapable. But there is scope for some reduction. This applies both to continue reporting and to trade promotion work. Less emphasis should, webelieve, be placed on routine periodic economic reporting, especially from postswhere statistical and other information can be secured on a regular and reliablebasis from other sources. It was made clear to us that industry in this country setscomparatively little store by the type of detailed periodic economic report whichhas hitherto been circulated to firms through the Board of Trade. Firms in thiscountry prefer to receive ad hoc economic reports heralding new trends ordevelopments likely to have a bearing on their interests. Similarly, the marketreports which British firms value most highly are those which contain informationrelated to the needs of particular industries and, indeed, particular firms. more time will be freed for this type of work if reports of a routine or periodic natureare reduced. However, firms in this country must make their needs known asprecisely as possible in asking for market information. Indiscriminate requestspressed forward to the point of action. At this level, as well as in the Foreign and commonwealth Relations Offices, a more systematic use should be made of outsideexperts on a consultant basis.234. We believe that a Cabinet Office Committee reinforced in the ways wehave proposed would be in the best position to bring to Ministers interdepartmentallyagreed papers with specific recommendations for action on matters of foreignpolicy, defence and finance.
(simply clog the machine. We are glad to know that the Board of Trade have taken steps to minimise requirements for economic reports and have given overseas posts wider discretion in deciding what market reports they should prepare.240. Commercial staff might, we feel, allow themselves a greater degree ofselectivity in their export promotion work. Some export enquiries are moreimportant than others. Some posts are already trying to discriminate. Posts abroadmight justifiably save themselves considerable effort by referring to the Board ofTrade enquiries which are not properly documented or market enquiries of the questionnaire type sent out by Market Research organisations.241. There is scope, too, for selectivity at home. An inevitable by-product of general publicity about exports and export services is an increase in the numberof enquiries sent to overseas posts by firms unlikely to be able to sell successfullyabroad in particular markets. Publicity at home should be aimed at those firms and industries most likely to be able to sell in particular overseas markets. Thisis work for the Export Services Branch and the Regional Controllers of the Boardof Trade with the advice and help of Trade Associations and Chambers ofCommerce. We believe that &quot; targeting&quot; export information will pay exportdividends. In this way, the volume of work can to some extent be controlled andthat which remains directed to real prospects in the export field. We recognisethat a policy of &quot; targeting &quot; may give rise to complaints. Ministers, Members ofParliament and Departmental Heads must be prepared to accept this.242. If the advantages of the unified Service are to be fully realised in thefield of economic and commercial work, the following points will need attention.243. First, continuity is essential if effective contact with local importersand agents is to be maintained and the goodwill of local businessmen and government officials fostered. In the past, there has been a tendency to move stafftoo frequently. We hope that our recommendations on manpower (para. 88)will permit a slower rate of transfer and allow for overlaps where necessary.Commercial staff should normally be expected to serve from four to five years at one post, unless conditions there are exceptionally trying. Whilst four to fiveyears should be regarded as the normal tour of duty, we certainly should not want to discourage the Diplomatic Service on occasion from leaving commercial staff at posts for longer periods. The danger is that even the best officer can becomestale if left too long in the same job. With this reservation, the longer a memberof the Service remains in a commercial appointment, the more valuable he islikely to become.244. Second, officers must be properly trained in commercial work from the start of their appointments. We give our views on this in more detail in the chapterof our report dealing with training (paras. 439-440). Suffice it to say here that tosend out commercial personnel without proper specialist training or languagequalifications is to waste good material and, possibly, to hinder rather than helpexport promotion.245. Third, the need to ensure that manpower is deployed where it is mostproductive applies particularly to export and commercial work. One factor to betaken into account in assessing the need for commercial staff is that at present80% of our exports go to thirty-five countries. However, the actual level of tradewith any one country is by no means the only criterion for determining the proper-strength of our commercial staff there. In some countries whose trade with us is so high and steady relatively little help from official commercial staff is required tokeep it flowing. Problems of trade in such countries are more often than not thosewhich relate to major international economic and commodity questions. Thus, inthese countries, more of the staff may have to concentrate on economic than onstraightforward commercial work.246. Different considerations apply in developing countries. Such countries may have balance of payments difficulties or may want to protect their owndeveloping industries. They may feel unable to give import licences for consumerand capital goods of the kind we wish to export; or they may wish to linkcontracts with the promise of aid or long-term credits. These countries might seemunpromising areas in which to post a sizeable commercial staff. There may betruth in this, but it is not- the whole truth. International loans to developing countries can provide opportunities for British contractors and for exports ofBritish capital goods. Such opportunities will be lost unless we have a man on
the spot. And, as developing countries develop, the greater are the opportunities of trade. There is also a great need for skilled commercial staff in countries whichare remote from us and in those where trading is on a state-controlled basis. Inthe remote countries, the number of visiting British businessmen is small but thosewho do come often need a great deal of help and advice. In state-trading countries,such as those of the Soviet bloc, the need is for commercial staff who remainlong enough to acquire experience in dealing with state monopolies and export and Import Agencies.. 247. Locally-engaged personnel are particularly useful in commercial work.They amass a detailed knowledge of the local scene, its personalities andpossibilities and, as they are not normally liable to be transferred elsewhere, they provide essential continuity. At present, overseas posts make extensive use oflocally-engaged staff as &quot; Market Officers &quot;. We should much prefer the term&quot; Commercial Officers&quot;. Their main function is, and will remain, the handling of individual export and agency enquiries. In general, we believe, the status of locally-engaged commercial staff is too low. We should like to see their experience andskill recognised to a greater extent in terms of promotion to higher gradings andpositions of greater responsibility. Later (paras. 585-589) we set out proposals on conditions of service for locally-engaged staff. We see no reason whyan experienced locally-engaged officer should not supervise the work of a juniorand inexperienced home-based officer. We wish to get away from the tendency for locally-engaged officers to handle all case-work and for home-based officers to play only a supervisory role in this field. Home-based commercial staff should in their early years acquire personal experience of handling detailed market work.This will stand them in good stead when later they are appointed to commercialposts in more senior ranks.248. It has to be recognised that locally-engaged staff cannot be appointed with the prospect of a life-long career. Most locally-engaged Commercial Officersbecome less effective if they stay too long in the same job in the same place. Thereare few opportunities for offering these officers a commercial post at another mission and, as a rule, they have personal reasons for not wishing to move. It may well happen in many countries that about ten years is normally the longest period for which even the best commercial officer should expect or be expected to remain. We donot, of course, envisage an absolute ban on the employment of locally-engagedCommercial Officers for a longer period where desirable. The proposal we makelater (para. 586) for a superannuation scheme makes possible a more flexibleapproach to this problem.249. The Foreign Office has recently begun a scheme whereby a limited number of young men from industry work in the Foreign Office for a period ofone year. The Foreign Office in turn hopes to be able to lend to industry officersin their thirties who have shown promise in their careers and would benefit by aperiod of service in industry. These are useful attempts to increase mutual understanding between the Foreign Service and industry. We hope that they willbe continued within the framework of the new Service.250. We have also considered the possibility of arranging for men from industry to be used on commercial work at posts abroad. Even if firms provedwilling to release really good men and we doubt whether in practice manywould be able to there is real objection to this proposal. It was put to us by trade associations that commercial staff overseas often have to be given a confidential insight into business transactions which those concerned would not wish their competitors to have. If, therefore, businessmen on temporary secondmentwere to serve abroad in a commercial post, representatives of other firms in thesame line of business might not feel able to approach them with the sameconfidence as they would approach regular career officers. We see force in this argument. The objection would not, however, apply to permanent recruitmentthrough the over-age competition (paras. 376-379) of men and women with experience of work in business firms.251. Where British Chambers of Commerce and similar organisations havebeen set up overseas they sometimes provide the same type of export service ascommercial sections of official British Missions. We therefore considered whetherit would be possible to leave more of the work to Chambers of Commerce.However, some Chambers of Commerce overseas are not equipped to handle a
large volume of export promotion work. Most of the evidence we received afhome and abroad did not support the idea that British Chambers of Commerceshould take over all agency and commercial enquiry work, leaving the commercialsections of official Missions to deal with matters involving negotiation with overseas governments. We believe that commercial case-work can, as at present,best be done by government staff abroad with the help of Chambers of commerce and other non-governmental organisations, such as the Export Councils. What isrequired is co-operation and consultation, not duplication. In some instances,non-official organisations abroad seem to be duplicating work, particularlycommercial case-work, which can be more effectively done by Foreign Serviceand Trade Commission Service posts. Some of these non-governmental organisations are subsidised, directly or indirectly, by the Exchequer. The principle should be that no non-governmental body should be assisted financially for doing the same work in the same place as an Embassy, High Commission or Consularpost. This, of course, does not rule out assistance to non-governmental bodies todo other work which they are best able to do.252. Regular consultations with industry about commercial work overseasare valuable. There is still among some British businessmen some lack of knowledge about the full range of facilities offered by the official commercialservices. It is essential to dispel this and to overcome any lingering prejudicesthere may be. Apart from such general publicity as is necessary, this can probablybest be achieved by more personal contact. We therefore support the arrangements being made for commercial staff from overseas posts to visit firms and businessorganisations in this country.253. Overseas, it is one of the major tasks for information officers to arrangepublicity in support of British exports.254. At some posts abroad the standard of the offices in which commercialsections work is below that which we think necessary to create a good impression of British efficiency. When new accommodation is being planned adequate spaceshould be allocated to commercial sections and this should be properly furnishedand equipped.255. There would be advantage in introducing a standard records system with appropriate equipment which would apply to all commercial posts throughoutthe world. Commercial staff would be able, with such a standard system, to adaptthemselves more rapidly to work in a new post.256. &quot; British Weeks&quot; and Trade Fairs, which can make a valuable contribution to our export effort, are being organised more frequently and on alarger scale. They call for the services of relatively large numbers of experiencedstaff for periods of up to about a year. It is beyond the capacity of anormally-staffed post to supply the necessary personnel without disrupting its ownday-to-day business. Commercial staff should not be diverted from their normal,and essential, tasks for any length of time in order to undertake special duties.The overseas posts concerned should therefore be consulted before a programmeof &quot; British Weeks &quot; or participation in Trade Fairs is adopted. This would enablethem to express their views about the timing of the operation and about the staffing problems which would arise. Specialist staff should then be made available as necessary.257. We cannot emphasise too strongly the importance of the commercialwork of the new Diplomatic Service. The country cannot afford to entrustcommercial work to any but the best. The custom is growing of ensuring thatpromising officers get experience of commercial work in the early and formativestages of their careers. This custom should become the rule. We look forward to the day, in the not too distant future, when every Ambassador and HighCommissioner will have served in a commercial capacity and have acquired atfirst hand a detailed knowledge of export promotion and what it entails. EachAmbassador and High Commissioner must regard commercial work as a primefunction of his Mission and its subordinate posts.Information Work258. In October 1952, an Independent Committee of Enquiry, under thechairmanship of the Earl of Drogheda, was set up &quot; to assess the value, actualand potential&quot; of British overseas information work and &quot; to advise upon the
^relative importance of different methods and services in different areas and circumstances &quot;. A summary of the Committee&apos;s report was published in April1954 (Cmd. 9138). The Committee concluded that information services to supportBritish policy overseas were essential and should be maintained on a stable basis and on an adequate scale. The report led to a considerable expansion of the overseas information effort. Since then, the Ministers responsible for co-ordinatinginformation work have conducted two enquiries of their own. The first resultedin some further expansion of the overseas information effort in selected places.Later, in 1961 and 1962, some contraction took place as part of the national economy drive. The second review concluded that the need for overseas information work had greatly increased in the years since the Drogheda Report.As a result, the budget of the Information Services as a whole for 1963/4 was increased by over a million pounds.259. The field of our own enquiry has been in some respects wider and in others narrower than that of those reviews. They were concerned with the entireinformation effort overseas, including that of the Central Office of Information, theBritish Council and the British Broadcasting Corporation. We have been directly concerned only with the information work of the Foreign and CommonwealthServices. The work of the Central Office of Information, the British Council andthe British Broadcasting Corporation falls outside our terms of reference. But wehave been bound to consider some of the functions of those organisations where theydirectly affect the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth Services. We have notattempted, as the reviews of information work did, to prescribe in geographical termswhere the main weight of the information effort should be placed.260. What we have been concerned to do has been to analyse and evaluate the relationship of the information work of the Foreign and Commonwealth services to their other activities and to consider its effectiveness and worth in proportion tothe effort devoted to it. We have also sought to establish the best methods of organising and staffing information work in the new Diplomatic Service.261. The Drogheda Committee recorded that at first they were inclined tobe sceptical about the value of overseas information activities many of which were then comparatively -new and had been the subject of much criticism. They alsofelt suspicious of &quot; the invasion by Government of a field which in the not verydistant past could be left to non-official agencies&quot;. Nevertheless, they found itimpossible to avoid the conclusion that a modern government had to concern itself with public opinion abroad and be properly equipped to deal with it. Theywere forced &quot; by sheer weight of evidence&quot; to make the following principalrecommendations:&quot; First The Overseas Information Services play an important and indeedessential role in support of our Foreign, Commonwealth and Colonialpolicies.Second This work should be done well, continuously and on an adequate scale.Third If all these requirements are to be met, more money must be spenton the Overseas Information Services.Fourth Changes are required in the pattern of work in order to bring it into line with our political, strategic and commercial needs &quot;.We accept these recommendations as statements of general principle.262. Information work is essentially an activity designed to further policies.The Information Services grew out of the need, in two world wars, to help achievepolitical aims by means of propaganda. The word &quot; propaganda &quot;, for all itsdispleasing overtones, conveys a sense of purpose and direction which is lackingin the word &quot; information &quot;. It is easy to see why it was necessary to adopt the moreurbane label and it is certainly vital not to jeopardise our reputation for truth.What is important is not the word or the title but the need to have always this sense of purpose and direction. The Information Services must not come to regard themselves as purveyors of information as an end in itself. As the Drogheda Reportputs it, &quot; overseas propaganda which meets a demand without producing someultimate political or commercial benefit for this country represents so much public money wasted &quot;. A certain amount of background information activity has to beundertaken by the Foreign and Commonwealth Services primarily in order to
acquire goodwill abroad and to establish an accepted and attractive channel of^communication. A foreign editor is more likely to be receptive to our view on a subject which matters to us if we have done our best to provide him with what hewants on other subjects and have convinced him that Britain is a country whose views on important questions are themselves important. The essential requirement,however, is to present the facts and the British point of view on issues where some definite and specific British interest is at stake. The more closely the informationeffort can be related in the mind of each Information Officer to the pursuit of aconscious British interest, the greater his worth is likely to be.263. There are issues on which it is not necessary for us to put out a &quot; Britishline &quot; at all. There are others in which Britain may have some interest but about which it may still not be worth while to run any widespread or intensive informationcampaign. To try to disseminate a point of view on everything would be to inviteridicule rather than respect. Our propaganda, like our policy itself, should be related to our strength and to reasonable expectations of what is attainable. Itwould be worse than useless to attempt to achieve, by propaganda, aims for which our strength is plainly insufficient. Sometimes the ground may be so stony that it isa waste of effort to sow seed in it at all. Sometimes, however, effective propagandacan make the vital margin of difference between the success and failure of a policy.When important issues arise where there is a reasonable prospect of this happening,we should strive relentlessly to make our views heard. The aim should be to beselective and realistic. Our information effort should concentrate on projects whichreally matter to us and generally not over-reach itself.264. There will, of course, be issues which do not affect us alone but in whichwe share an interest and responsibility with other friendly countries. We shouldnot exclude British information activity in such cases, provided the cause isworthwhile and is susceptible of being furthered by means of publicity.265. We should also concentrate, as the Drogheda Report proposed, on reaching &quot; the influential few &quot;. Public opinion, in democratic countries at least,is nowadays a highly important factor; but in most countries it is moulded byrelatively few. Our information effort should therefore be as discriminating inits choice of targets as in its choice of themes. It must be concentrated wherenews is made. The object should be to get as much of the dissemination aspossible done by local mass media. A story put out, even withoutacknowledgement, by a major news agency, newspaper or broadcastingnetwork can be of far more value than an official handout.266. We have said that information work can be valuable so long as it isnot regarded as an activity on its own but is clearly and consciously linked to specific policy objectives. We are therefore sceptical of the value of information work of a generalised character such as the &quot; Projection of Britain &quot;. Where,however, a &quot; Projection of Britain &quot; campaign is called for, it should be related to specific areas and to our policy requirements in them. For example, a campaign to stimulate the tourist trade may well be worth while in certain countries. but such a campaign should aim to do more than simply convey the idea that britain is a fine country, with a fine past and a promising future.267. Although the British Council lies outside our terms of reference, wehave felt it right to have regard to its activities in assessing the limits of the workof the Diplomatic Service in related spheres. We are in no doubt that activitiesof an educational and cultural nature overseas should remain the responsibilityof the British Council. Indeed, we consider the work undertaken by British Councilrepresentatives overseas to be vital.268. Because information work was regarded primarily as a means of supporting policy, it was thought right, when the Ministry of information was wound up after the War, to make the Foreign and Commonwealth RelationsOffices responsible for overseas information work in their own spheres. TheForeign Office carried this concept to its logical conclusion by using careerForeign Service officers for information work. The Drogheda committee considered, and we agree, that this arrangement is sound in principle. It makes the Foreign Service as a whole &quot; information-minded &quot; and more aware of theimportance and uses of publicity and of the requirements of the press, radio and television. Moreover, the qualifications required in an Information Officer atpolicy level are not primarily technical. What an Information Officer needs first
and foremost is close collaboration with political and commercial colleagues, an appreciation of what they are trying to achieve and the personality and ability to put this over at his particular post. An Information Officer must be, and beseen to be, a full member of the Embassy or High Commission team. If he is seen to be in the confidence of his colleagues and, above all, of the head of hispost, his effectiveness is that much the greater. The effectiveness of the Head ofthe Foreign Office News Department is enhanced by the fact that he accompaniesthe Foreign Secretary to all important international gatherings and is known tobe in his confidence. The same must be true of the relationship between anInformation Officer abroad and his Ambassador or High Commissioner. It iseasier for a career member of the Service to achieve such a position of intimacyand confidence.269. If information work is handled by career members of the Service, themajority of them, at an early stage of their careers, get the feel of working with thepress and develop a sense of public relations. The more experience they have ofinformation work, the less cause should there be for criticisms which are sometimeslevelled against Government Departments that they handle press and public relations badly. Contact with the foreign press is not only a job for the informationstaff but something in which all senior members of the staff of overseas missionsshould play a part. An Ambassador or High Commissioner has a particular need to be aware of the possibilities of publicity and to be adept at public relations.270. In endorsing the principle that information work should be undertaken by career members of the Foreign Service, the Drogheda Committee added tworiders which still need emphasis. The first was that, at the technical level, specialistsshould be recruited for posts which required qualifications such as personalexperience of journalism or knowledge of film work. The second proviso wasthat career men with no previous knowledge of publicity media should undertake a period of training before their first appointment overseas as Information Officers.Subject to these safeguards, the Drogheda Committee recommended that &quot; theCommonwealth Relations Office should consider the possibility of adopting asimilar policy for the staffing of their information posts abroad &quot;.271.- At present, information work in the Commonwealth Service is carriedout by members of an &quot; Information Class&quot;. They are recruited separately andemployed exclusively on information duties for the whole of their careers. Inevidence, representatives of the Commonwealth Relations Office said that they had now reached the provisional view that the balance of advantage lay in goingover to the system already adopted by the Foreign Office. They said that information work was not purely technical. Much information work had to be doneby officers not formally in information appointments at all. If information workwere handed over entirely to specialists, it might become regarded as esoteric.The essential link with other types of work would then be broken. On the otherhand, the Commonwealth Relations Office would have the same need as theForeign Office for technicians, for example to run publications which would be technically proficient and suited to local requirements. There would be difficulttransitional problems; the members of the separate Information Class would benaturally anxious about their future careers.272. The Foreign Office informed us that their continued experience of the unified system had convinced them that it was right. We share this View, whichis supported by what we saw and heard during our overseas tours at bothCommonwealth and foreign posts. We recommend therefore that the unifiedsystem should be adopted throughout in the new Diplomatic Service.273. This proposal will, we recognise, concern members of theCommonwealth Relations Office Information Class. These officers know their work and are dedicated to it. But we feel they occupy, and are conscious of occupying, a somewhat invidious position, as though they were permanentlyattached to the Commonwealth Service rather than part and parcel of it. this sense of isolation is increased at posts where the Information Section is housedin a separate building. It seems to us that members of the Information Class wouldbe able to make a greater contribution as full members of a unified diplomatic service. Not only that, but their status and career possibilities would be improved.274. We asked members of the Information Class and their Staff siderepresentatives about the change we propose. Many thought the change would, on3610H 2
balance, be in the public interest. Some thought that it would also be in the best interests of their own careers. Others, however, had personal anxieties. The mainfear was that, with their specialised and therefore limited experience, they mightbe at a disadvantage in competing for senior posts in the unified Service and might also stand to lose some of the specialised posts they now hold. These are naturalanxieties, particularly for older men. However, given sympathetic handling bythe combined Administration, these difficulties should not become serious or causehardship. Unification will be taking place against the background of a shortage of trained staff. There is no reason why an able man should fear for his job. In order,however, to reassure members of the Information Class, we recommend that allover the age of fifty on the date of the establishment of the new Service shouldbe permitted, if they wish, to spend the rest of their careers on information workonly. We also recommend that the changeover to the new system of handlinginformation work in Commonwealth countries should be introduced gradually andthat care should be taken not to rush existing members of the Information Classinto other work. Given time, most will recognise that it is in their own interests to widen their experience.275. Editors, film experts and other technicians should continue to be specially recruited for particular appointments. The Central Office of Informationcan make a contribution here by loaning officers for overseas work on a ratherlarger scale than at present. In the long run this will be of value to the central office of Information itself. The more of its officers who have served overseas,the more it will be able to relate its own activities to overseas requirements bymeans of first-hand knowledge. We think, however, that the scope for secondmentsin the reverse direction, to the Central Office of Information from the diplomatic service, is likely to be rather limited. But it may be valuable for some membersof the Executive grades who are to specialise in information work to serve fora period at the Central Office of Information. The aim would be to train them ina specialised technique.276. It would be wrong, in the new Service, to have any arrangement bywhich the number and location of information posts was controlled separately from other posts. To keep a separate pool or establishment of information posts,as the Foreign Office now does, would run counter to the need for flexibility.We should deprecate any tendency to chop and change the number of informationposts for short-term reasons. But there should be no pre-ordained decree that information work, any more than any other branch of work, should be entitled toa fixed share of the resources of the Service as a whole. The need for some types of work will grow and that for others will diminish. An advantage of a unifiedAdministration will be that it can respond to changes by a reallocation of its resources. This would be nullified if the control of the information establishmentswere not within the central control of the Chief of Administration.277. Information work needs its full share of good people. It is the kindof work which must be done really well if it is to be worth doing at all. To setpeople of unsuitable talents to do an information job is total waste. A proportionof the more promising members of the combined Service, including a fair shareof Administrative Class staff, must be encouraged to train for and specialise ininformation work. Thus, even if less information work were attempted, thatwhich continued could be better done.278. Finally, there is scope in the information field for the development ofcommon services between the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth relations office. The Central Office of Information itself is, of course, an important commonservice on which the unified Diplomatic Service will continue to rely. But furtherrationalisation should be considered. The Information Executive Department ofthe Foreign Office and the Information Services Department of the commonwealth relations Office might be brought together into a single joint department. their work is of the same kind. They both act as a link between overseas information officers and the Central Office of Information in obtaining press material,feature articles, films, television material and radio tapes for overseas posts. Ifthese two departments were fused, but separate Information Policy departments in the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Foreign Office maintained, itshould be possible to keep the work of the new joint department in harmony with policy. Any functions which do not lend themselves readily to amalgamationmight be transferred to the Information Policy Departments.
Consular Work281. We have looked at consular work mainly from three aspects. First, wehave examined the broad purpose and functions of British consular poststhroughout the world. Second, we have considered whether changes are needed in the methods and scope of consular work in the strict sense of the services provided for the protection of British subjects and interests overseas. Third, wehave given attention to the special problems of the extent of the need for consular services in Commonwealth countries and of the way in which our representation in Commonwealth cities, other than capital cities, ought to be organised.282. Consular posts throughout the world have acquired a range of duties and responsibilities far wider than might be implied by their name. To some people, the title &quot; Consulate &quot; or &quot; Consulate-General&quot; may suggest that the dutiesof these posts are confined to ensuring the safety and protection of British subjects in their districts. In fact, the range of work is much broader.283. The Head of a Consular post is responsible for all British commercial interests, including export promotion, in his district. He must maintain good relations with the local authorities, keep his Ambassador posted about politicaland economic developments, support British information and cultural activities and provide a focus and rallying point for the local British community. Thus,within his district, a Consul has the same broad representational responsibilitiesas an Ambassador or High Commissioner has in relation to an overseas country as a whole.284. The value to Britain of the consular posts now maintained seemed tous to vary greatly. Their staffing for the most part reflected this. Some consulardistricts cover some of the richest and most populous markets in the world. british exports to such districts can be greater, and susceptible of greater growth, than british exports to some independent countries as a whole. Some consular postshave a key role to play in political and economic reporting. Opportunities forinfluencing overseas opinion in a sense favourable to British interests and policiescan sometimes be found more easily in provincial cities, where our Consulatesare, than in capitals. At other consular posts, however, the work has diminished in importance. In some areas, the scope for export promotion may have been reduced.There may be places where an honorary or locally-engaged official could carryout any work necessary.285. In general, however, we formed the view that consular work is so important as to require reinforcement rather than contraction. By this we do not mean an increase in the number of consular posts but rather the strengthening ofthose posts where the range of the work is great and its value and importanceincreasing. There are places where the general range of activities carried out byConsuls-General and their staffs transcends in importance that of minor embassies.Consular posts will require a fairer share of the manpower resources of the new279. It was suggested to us that the two Information Policy departments should also be amalgamated. This, it was thought, would have administrativeadvantages in facilitating the production and clearance of guidance andbackground telegrams. However, in present circumstances, it would be going too far to merge these two departments. So long as there are two Departments ofState, responsible for our policies towards different countries of the world, eachwill need to retain control of the department responsible for directing the publicity line to be taken in support of these policies.280. We regard the work of the News Department of the Foreign Officeand the News Room of the Commonwealth Relations Office as of particular importance. Their task is not only to keep the British press properly informedbut to maintain close contact with representatives of the foreign press. Withoutthe work of the News Departments in London the task of our overseas missions in trying to ensure that British policies and motives are properly understood wouldbe much more difficult. We view as premature proposals for merging the NewsDepartments. Correspondents would probably find it convenient to be able togo to a single source for information relating to British overseas policy generally.But, we think, the Foreign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary will eachneed to have sole control of his own public spokesman so long as the foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices remain separate.
Diplomatic Service, not only in quantity but in quality. As soon as recruitment!permits, we should like to see more Administrative Class officers appointed toconsular posts, especially during their early years of service. Much consular work iseminently suitable for officers of the Executive grades. But it should not be leftentirely to them and there is an area of consular work which is best done by administrative Class officers. In any case, consular posts are excellent traininggrounds.286. Consular Officers should not be moved from appointment to appointmenttoo rapidly. A Consul-General is perhaps the best example of an officer who oughtto be left at his post for a considerable period of time. Some officers who would notbe happy in posts of the greatest political complexity and responsibility are admirablysuited to build up for themselves and for their country a position of respect and influence in a senior consular capacity. Over a period of years such officers can cometo exert a disproportionate influence and make their special qualities, even theiridiosyncracies, speak for them. In the former Consular Services it was regarded asa fitting climax to a career to serve for a number of years as a Consul-General. Thisexample could with advantage be followed in the new Service.287. We now consider consular work in the sense of watching over,safeguarding and assisting British subjects and British protected persons.288. Heads of Consular posts and their staff have to devote much of their timeto trade promotion, political and economic reporting, information work and otherrepresentational functions. These functions, and particularly trade promotion, maybe of more importance in national terms than routine consular work. However, itis routine consular work which for most members of the British public is the shopwindow of the overseas representational services. The man in the street has no directdealings with the Foreign or Commonwealth Relations Offices or their overseas posts except when faced with some personal problem. He may be brought into touchwith consular officials after an accident or a relative^ sudden death abroad. in circumstances of tragedy or anxiety, a high degree of tact, promptness and goodjudgment is needed in meeting the needs of next-of-kin. Special care must be taken over the performance of consular work and in selecting officers for it.289. The Head of a Consular post must pay special attention to the supervision of the routine consular work and be ready to interview personally British subjects in distress. His wider representational duties have a direct bearing on his ability torender effective consular services. He must cultivate such relations with theauthorities and leading citizens in his district as will enable him, in case of need,to act on behalf of the local British community and British visitors.290. The nature and emphasis of consular protection work in many partsof the world has changed since 1939. Some British communities overseas are stillgrowing but, more often, there has been a run-down of large British residentcommunities, such as those in China and parts of South America. But it does not follow that the dwindling of a community necessarily lessens the amount of consularwork to be done. British communities which find themselves in straitenedcircumstances or under political or economic pressure may be in greater need of consular assistance and encouragement than they were at the height of theirprosperity.291. However, the most important change in recent years has been thedramatic increase in the number of British subjects travelling abroad, particularlytourists. This increase in foreign travel has so far been most keenly felt at postson the continent of Europe. But as tourists extend their horizons, the impact of tourism on consular representatives will be felt more widely. The pressure of increased tourism on consular facilities is largely seasonal. This makes it harderto cater for the needs of tourists and has caused serious organisational problems.The Consular Department and Treaty and Nationality Department of the ForeignOffice, the Passport Office, and the Nationality and General Department of theCommonwealth Relations Office have been affected as well as posts abroad.292. The problem is not only one of increased numbers. The travellers areof a different kind. Many who now take their holidays abroad have little or no experience of overseas travel and tend to require more official help. Necessaryextra work is readily accepted. However, among the four million Britons who gooverseas each year there is a small but growing minority who fail to makeproper travel arrangements, to purchase return tickets, to cover risks by insurance
r to take adequate funds with them. This minority make for consular staffs agreat deal of work of a kind which we believe to be avoidable. Some seem to expectfrom consular posts a kind of travel agency service on a 24-hour basis. The numberof BritLh subjects who have to be repatriated at public expense is increasing atan alarming rate. This increase is due almost entirely to those who have failedto take reasonable care over their holiday arrangements. In 1962, 604 people hadto be repatriated as &quot; Distressed British Subjects &quot; from Paris alone as comparedwith 372 in 1954. By the end of the first nine months of 1963, the figure for 1962had already been exceeded and stood at 640.293. Members of the public clearly and righly expect consular protectionwhen they are in trouble or difficulty. Help must not be withheld from Britishsubjects who find themselves in genuine need of consular assistance. But we are strongly of the opinion that consular offices must not be expected or encouraged to provide a free round-the-clock travel agency service.294. Against this background we recommend that the following proposals should be examined:(a) Temporary staff. Since the pressure of tourist work is largely seasonal,temporary staff might be recruited either from Britain or locally tohelp on a contract basis during the busy seasons of the year at consularposts abroad and in departments dealing with consular work in whitehall. Many types of consular work are suitable for women andwe believe that many women would welcome the opportunity of suchservice. Senior undergraduates might be considered for employmentin their vacations. We understand that a number of womenundergraduates were employed in the Passport Office this summer andthat this experiment was a success. The main requirements are a sense of responsibility and helpfulness, common sense, tact and a knowledgeof the local language.At present, there is a small panel of retired officers who can becalled upon by the Passport Office if a natural disaster or the breakdown of law and order in a country abroad suddenly increases the load of work in London. This is a useful insurance, for use inemergencies. The panel might be enlarged and made available for temporary employment in all consular departments in Whitehall.(b) Measures to limit the volume of work and costs. Foreign Office postsspent over  60,000 on the repatriation of Distressed British Subjects inthe financial year 1962/3. The practice is to provide those needingrepatriation with tickets home and a small sum for subsistence, againsta written promise to repay. We recommend that, in all but the mostgenuine cases of hardship, H.M. Government should insist on obtainingrepayment of all repatriation costs in order not to encourage abuse of repatriation facilities. At present it seems that only about two-thirds of the sums expended are recovered.Frivolous applications for repatriation at the public expense mightbe further discouraged by charging a fee for administrative expenses.The fee could be remitted in cases of genuine and unpredictablehardship. Travellers should be persuaded in all possible ways, andparticularly through the good offices of travel agents, to take outinsurance against accidents, illness, death and travel risks.A useful booklet of &quot; Essential Information for those intending to travel overseas &quot;, prepared by the Passport Office, is handed out with every passport. It is also supplied freely to travel agents and banks.This booklet should be revised in such a way as to make it absolutelyclear what services in the way of consular assistance can reasonably be expected and what cannot. This would help to preventmisunderstandings. At the same time, the booklet could be made more attractive in form and the facts presented in a more readable way.(c) Consular Procedures. Many consular procedures are of considerableantiquity. It seemed to us that some needed to be revised andstreamlined. For example, the use of fee stamps for charges forconsular services is cumbersome and time-consuming. Nor is it easy tojustify the present laborious procedure of accounting for each fee. A
review of consular procedures is required. We recommend that worlfstudy experts should be associated with the review.A revision of the Merchant Shipping Acts is now underconsideration. These Acts impose a wide range of detailed duties onconsular staff and there is a confusing multiplicity of shipping forms.Conditions have greatly changed since the Merchant Shipping Acts were passed. Many of the duties at present required of consular staff mayno longer be necessary; others could be entrusted to agents of shipping lines. We recommend that in considering legislation every effort shouldbe made to reduce or simplify the duties laid upon consular officers.Consular Representation in Commonwealth Countries295. In the past it has been held that United Kingdom citizens in commonwealth countries do not need formal consular services. The traditionhas been that, as British subjects, they are not regarded as &quot; foreigners &quot; and can rely on the normal facilities of the Commonwealth country where they happen to be. This concept is no longer realistic. In Commonwealth countries as in othersproblems are bound to arise for United Kingdom citizens in which they need the help of properly equipped officials from their own country. The principle thatconsular work on behalf of United Kingdom citizens in Commonwealth countries is unnecessary has often had to be breached already. Consular services in theCommonwealth have had to be provided on an ad hoc basis by officials who donot enjoy normal consular facilities or recognition. Often Information Officersand Trade Commissioners have had to do the job. There is a real need in many places in the Commonwealth to face the fact that open and formal Britishconsular facilities are needed to enable consular help and protection to be givento United Kingdom citizens. This need not mean that United Kingdom citizensin Commonwealth countries should cease to avail themselves of the special facilities which other Commonwealth countries continue to make available to nationals of Commonwealth countries. Commonwealth governments took partin the negotiations which resulted in the drawing up of the Vienna convention on Consular Relations in 1963. This should lead to greater standardisation of consular practices and privileges throughout the world, including theCommonwealth. Thus, the time is opportune for placing British consularrepresentation in Commonwealth countries on a more regular basis.296. A second factor, this time of an organisational character, has animportant bearing on consular facilities in Commonwealth countries. At present,British representation in cities of the Commonwealth other than capital cities is divided in a way which, organisationally, is neither rational nor efficient. Insome non-capital cities of the Commonwealth, there is a Deputy HighCommissioner with supporting staff from the Commonwealth Service and a trade commissioner with supporting staff from the Board of Trade. At posts wherethere is both a Deputy High Commissioner and a Trade Commissioner, the relationship between the two officers is often obscure and can be unsatisfactory.Where there is a Trade Commissioner but no Deputy High Commissioner, thereis sometimes an Information Office staffed from the Information Class of theCommonwealth Relations Office. In such cases the relationship of the InformationOfficer to the Trade Commissioner is unsatisfactorily defined.297. Thus, there can be more than one official British representative inseparate offices in important Commonwealth cities without any clear chain of command except that they are all subordinate to the High Commissioner.Everything therefore depends on the success with which individual officersestablish good personal relations with one another and manage thereby tosurmount the difficulties inherent in the system. Nobody to whom we spokethought the system defensible. High Commissioners, Deputy High Commissioners,Trade Commissioners, Information Officers, representatives of commonwealth countries and local British citizens were all agreed.298. In Commonwealth cities where there is a Trade Commissioner only,the situation is not complicated by problems of relative status and spheres ofresponsibility but is nonetheless not satisfactory. When a Trade Commissioner isthe sole or senior British representative, he is bound in practice to acquire broadrepresentational and consular duties. At present. Trade Commissioners do nothave proper support for this role and can sometimes undertake it only at somedetriment to their commercial work.
Visa Work301. At most foreign posts, applications from nationals of other countries for visas to enter Britain and Commonwealth territories not represented in thecountry of application are handled by consular staff as part of their normal range of duties. At all Commonwealth High Commission posts, this work is carried out as part of the normal work of the Passport Section.302. At certain foreign posts, however, where large numbers of visaapplications are received and where these need to be scrutinised with particular care, there are separate Visa Sections. These are staffed by officers of the PassportControl Department of the Foreign Office. The staff of this department is recruitedseparately from that of the Foreign Service. All applications to visit Britain whicha Visa or Consular Officer at an overseas post does not have authority to decideare referred to the Passport Control Department. This department in turn referscases as necessary to the Home Office and to other interested Departments.Doubtful applications for visas to enter Commonwealth countries are referreddirect to the Commonwealth Governments concerned by the Visa Officer. Ifsecurity considerations are involved, simultaneous reference is made to PassportControl Department.303. It seemed to us that there might be advantage in abolishing separateVisa Sections and a separately recruited Passport Control Service. If visa workeverywhere were conducted as part of normal consular work, there could be greater uniformity in staff selection and conditions of service and, in some cases,administrative economies. However, we were advised that the Home Office would prefer to retain the service of specialist Visa Officers at those posts where thereis a need for particular care in the scrutiny of applications. We were told that theinstructions by which Visa Officers are guided are necessarily complicated andthat consular staffs, because of the multiplicity of their other duties, cannot reasonably be expected to attain the high degree of specialised visa knowledgewhich is called for at particular posts. In the circumstances we accept thatseparate Visa Sections, staffed from the Passport Control Department, should beretained at certain Missions abroad so long as applications either heavy in volume or tending to be difficult in character continue to be received there.304. Special care should be taken, in particular at the recruitment stage,to apply to members of the Visa Sections security and other standards no lessstringent than those applied to the Diplomatic Service as a whole. We were not altogether sure in our minds about the quality of some of the junior staff employed in Visa Sections abroad. The senior staff were somewhat frustrated intheir career prospects. There are only six senior Visa Officer posts and there isno possibility of home postings. It might help if, from time to time, some officers from Visa Sections could be given a tour on general consular duties. We hopethis can be done.299. We recommend strongly that British representation in commonwealth countries should be unified to correspond to present-day needs. The creation of a unified Diplomatic Service will offer the opportunity for carrying out this necessary reform. In all non-capital Commonwealth cities where there is officialBritish representation, one officer, under the High Commissioner, should beappointed to take charge of all aspects of the work, trade, representation and consular. As a result, we would have, for the first time, a closely knit and properlyco-ordinated representation in subordinate Commonwealth posts.300. The unification of commercial, representational and day-to-day consularactivities will need to be introduced with careful regard to local circumstances,especially where it is desired to change present styles and titles. Where localsusceptibilities permit, the most practical course will be to adopt consular stylesand procedures completely. Elsewhere, it may be preferable to keep the name&quot; Deputy High Commissioner &quot; for the Head of the Post, although he will be incharge of a unified organisation including officers with consular designations.Whatever other changes in title are made, we see no occasion to alter the title of&quot; High Commissioner&quot; as applied to the senior British representative in a commonwealth capital.
Passport Office307. The Passport Office is primarily responsible for issuing and renewingBritish passports in the United Kingdom. The Office is also responsible for issuingUnited Kingdom re-entry visas to foreign nationals resident in this country,diplomatic and official re-entry visas to members of foreign diplomatic missions in London and entry and transit visas for British Colonial territories.308. Overseas, passports are issued to British subjects by consular officersin foreign countries and by United Kingdom High Commissioners in commonwealth countries. The Passport Office maintains a central index of allUnited Kingdom passport facilities granted in foreign and Commonwealth countries.309. The Office is part of the Foreign Office. It is, however, separatelyhoused and its staff are nearly all members of the Home Civil Service. The staff numbers over 600, of whom 485 are employed in the London Headquarters. Theremainder are stationed in Liverpool, Glasgow and Belfast. In addition, some170 temporary staff are employed during the peak summer travel season.310. The Passport Office performs an essential function well and we do not propose any changes.Aid and Technical Assistance311. The provision of aid and technical assistance plays an increasingly important part in our overseas relationships. It is of great significance in politicaland economic as well as humanitarian terms. What we are able to do in this fieldwill have a real and in some cases decisive effect on our future influence and tradein many areas of the world.312. The overseas Departments and their economic and commercial staffsoverseas have a major constructive role in the formulation of financial aid policy.There is thus more need for the overseas Services to have staff with some knowledgeof regional and world-wide economic development and international financing.313. Technical assistance is distinct from financial aid, though of courseclosely related to it. It consists essentially of helping other countries to develop their own resources. The principal means of doing this is to make expert adviceavailable. Responsibility in Whitehall for technical assistance to bothCommonwealth and foreign countries at present lies with the Department of technical Co-operation. This Department, established in 1961, has no overseas posts or staff of its own, with the exception of the Middle East DevelopmentDivision in Beirut which it took over from the Foreign Office. Foreign and commonwealth Relations Office posts abroad therefore deal with all matters affecting the Department of Technical Co-operation overseas. Thus, although theDepartment of Technical Co-operation lies outside our terms of reference, we have thought it right to consider the work done on its behalf overseas.314. Officers engaged on technical assistance work overseas have five mainfunctions.(i) They act as a link between the Department of Technical Co-operation and governments who wish to have technical assistance.(ii) They keep in day-to-day touch with the thoughts and plans of Ministriesin overseas countries. Close contact of this kind is most likely to leadto the discovery of suitable projects for technical assistance. They alsoseek to make the administrative task of applying for assistance as simpleand straightforward as possible.305. We asked whether it was possible to speed Hp and simplify the wor&amp;of issuing visas. Some improvement is, we think, desirable. We suggest that theOrganisation and Methods Section of the Treasury might help to examinepossible improvements.306. So long as it is necessary to maintain a separate cadre of Visa Officers,conditions of service should, where applicable, conform broadly to those in the diplomatic Service.
^    (iii)(iv)(v)Legal Advice318. The overseas Departments have been increasingly faced with problemscalling for legal advice, particularly in the field of international law. We have &quot;been concerned to ensure -that adequate legal advice will be available in the newDiplomatic Service.319. The arrangements by which the legal staff in the Foreign Service are atpresent recruited and organised are satisfactory and their numbers are broadly inscale with requirements. The same cannot be said for the Commonwealth RelationsService.320. Legal advisers are an integral part of the Foreign Service. broadly speaking, they serve on the same pay scales and have the same conditions of service as other members of Branch A. In theory they are interchangeable with othermembers of the Service, though this rarely happens in practice. Legal advisers arerecruited through the Civil Service Commission by application and interview.Appointments are open to any barrister or solicitor or equivalent in Britain. Infact, all the present legal advisers are members of the English Bar.321. There are twelve legal advisers serving in the Foreign Office and threeat Foreign Office posts abroad. In addition, there is the post of Judge of her majesty&apos;s Chief Court in the Persian Gulf. Legal advisers have their own supportingstaff and there is a separate Legal Library. Their functions are wide. For example,they advise on the drafting of treaties, on litigation in foreign countries and onlegislation in the Persian Gulf States. They advise on and conduct cases beforeInternational Tribunals. They co-operate with Parliamentary Counsel on parliamentary Bills, prepare cases for the opinion of the Law Officers and adviseother Government Departments on questions of international law and treatydrafting. For this work a measure of independence is essential. In some respectslegal advisers must act like the governor of an engine: sometimes their function isto restrain. They must be free to express their own opinions on legal issues butthey must also understand and support the foreign policies of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and work in harmony with their colleagues in the Foreign Office.They do all they can to help the progress of technical assistance schemes and to see that British experts are used to best advantage.They assist British experts abroad in administrative matters such as housing and transport. This task takes a great deal of time.They provide a link with the aid-giving agencies of other countries andthose of international organisations like the United Nations. Theselinks need strengthening. This is work which, can only be done effectivelyon the spot in the recipient country.315. We recommend that technical assistance work overseas should beregarded as an integral part of the tasks of the new Service. Wherever possible,technical assistance staff should be regular members of the Service, though thereis scope for secondments from the Department of Technical Co-operation. Thoseseconded would be able to contribute their knowledge of departmental procedures and work, acquiring at the same time practical experience of technical assistanceproblems in the recipient countries. Only where the volume of technical assistance is substantial will it be necessary to have an officer concerned solely with it. TheDepartment of Technical Co-operation should be consulted about appointments to full-time technical assistance posts or posts where technical assistance occupies a major part of an officers time.316. There is a fairly widespread need to provide adequate Executive staff for the work of looking after the needs of visiting experts who are engaged to givetechnical advice. It is wasteful to have this work done by Administrative staff asis too often the case at the moment.317. Although the British Council is outside our terms of reference, weobserve that in some countries the Council covers similar ground to that coveredby officials working on behalf of the Department of Technical Co-operation. Thereis in fact overlap. The dividing line between the field of operation of the BritishCouncils representatives and those of the Department of Technical Co-operation is ill-defined. Further clarification is needed.
Claims Work330. The Foreign Office receives and examines two broad categories of claims. First, there are cases in which British nationals or their property, rightsor interests have, or may have, suffered injury, damage or loss in a foreign country.Second, there are cases in which the government of a foreign country allege thattheir nationals have similarly suffered in any territory for the foreign relations ofwhich Her Majesty&apos;s Government are responsible.322. Unlike their colleagues, legal advisers serve for long periods at home.No legal adviser is likely to serve abroad more than twice during his career. Theselong periods of service at home make for a measure of stability, though perhaps atthe cost of some staleness. They enable legal advisers to act to some extent as thememory as well as the conscience of the Foreign Service. Although legal advisersare for the most part stationed at home, they have to travel abroad a great deal to international conferences.323. We believe that Foreign Office legal advisers ought to participate more in the work of bodies such as the International Law Association. The limiting factorwill be the availability of staff.324. The Commonwealth Relations Office shares a joint legal service withthe Colonial Office, both Offices having a legal adviser of their own. This, wewere told, was a pragmatic arrangement in a period of transition, but we cannotbelieve it adequate to present requirements. It will certainly not be adequate for future needs.325. At present, the legal staff in the Commonwealth Relations Office consists of a Legal Adviser, detached from another Department, an Assistant Legal Adviser,two Temporary Senior Legal Assistants and one Legal Assistant. There is noregular recruiting arrangement other than that which operates in respect of thejoint legal service with the Colonial Office. The continued existence of the jointestablishment with the Colonial Office has on occasion led to difficulty in findingstaff to cope with the growing amount of legal work within the commonwealth relations Office. No members of the Commonwealth Relations Office legal staff are posted abroad on a resident basis and there has not been enough staff to meetdemands to send people to conferences.326. The legal staff in the Commonwealth Relations Office advise on thelegal aspects of every part of the Office&apos;s work. They are consulted, for example,on the constitutional relationship of Commonwealth countries and on theinterpretation of agreements between Commonwealth countries. They are also concerned with legislation by other Commonwealth countries which may affectBritish interests and with questions of citizenship and diplomatic immunity arising in relation to the Commonwealth. The Legal Adviser also advises the Central AfricanOffice and, on Commonwealth aspects of its work, the Department of technical co-operation.327. We believe the Diplomatic Service must have a unified legal section,with a structure of its own and common recruitment. Recruits would be assigned to either the Foreign Office or the Commonwealth Relations Office and would tend to specialise in one or the other, though they would remain interchangeable.Legal posts overseas would be staffed by the best candidate from either Department.Legal advisers would remain eligible for transfer to non-legal posts in the new service.328. We see no serious problem about the concept of a unified legal section in the unified Service. It can have positive advantages in terms both of administration and recruitment. There will continue to be a requirement for specialised advice on commonwealth questions in which detailed knowledge of Commonwealth law willbe valuable. But, in general, the questions to be dealt with by legal staff are closelyakin, whether they arise in Commonwealth or in foreign countries.329. In the transitional stage there may be problems of personnel becauseof the limited number of higher-ranking legal posts. But we do not believe these will prove insuperable. For some time, at least, senior legal staff in theCommonwealth Relations Office will have to be chosen from those with recent experience of the legal problems special to the Commonwealth.
Research Work and Libraries335. The Research Department of the Foreign Office and the Planning and research Unit of the Commonwealth Relations Office employ a number of researchspecialists. Their work is both historical and political. They provide historicalbackground to and detailed information on current issues. Such specialists are clearly needed. Full use should be made of their services by executive departmentsso as to ensure that action on current problems is not taken in ignorance of the lessons of the past. For this reason, it is valuable to have members of the research department associated with study groups for long-term policy formation.336. The Planning and Research Unit of the Commonwealth Relations office was established in 1959 and at present comprises four research posts. The ResearchOfficers are members of the Commonwealth Service and in theory, therefore, liable for service overseas. In practice, they have so far served only in the commonwealth relations Office since there are no research posts in our Missions in theCommonwealth.337. The Research Department of the Foreign Office has a strength of rather more than forty research posts, of which about thirty are reserved for members ofa special Research cadre. This cadre, as now constituted, was formed in 1957. the research Department is organised in sections, mainly on a geographical basis.Each section has, as a rule, a Research Assistant Grade I as its head, with a numberof Research Assistants of Grades II and III in support. Transfers between sectionsare rare because of the specialist nature of the work. Research Assistants arerecruited by a special competition run by the Civil Service Commissioners and)331. The Foreign Office gives an aggrieved British subject such assistancein the form of consular or diplomatic support as the facts of the case justify.If an intergovernmental claim is possible under either the general principles ofinternational law or the provisions of a specific international agreement, the ForeignOffice, either itself or with the assistance of the Foreign Compensation Commission,collects, scrutinises and prepares the individual claims. It then presents these tothe foreign government and seeks to negotiate a satisfactory settlement either of individual claims or by a lump sum. If successful, it arranges for the distributionof the compensation, either by itself or by the Foreign Compensation Commission,in accordance with Orders in Council for the preparation of which it is responsible.The majority of claims arise from war, riots, nationalisation and similar deprivationsunder foreign municipal law, and wrongful acts by governments, for exampleshooting down of aircraft.332. Claims work is handled within the Foreign Office mainly by ClaimsDepartment, although there is also a special &quot; British Property in Egypt Section &quot;.The Claims Department is staffed in part by officers having legal qualifications and experience. These officers, some of whom are engaged on a contract basis, areseldom called upon to serve abroad for any length of time. The work is highly specialised and is not of a kind which can be done by staff serving for short spellsonly. Length of experience is a positive advantage. To the extent that general-service officers are employed on claims work, this requirement needs to be borne in mind.333. New claims are constantly arising and it is not likely that claims workin the international field will decrease in volume in the foreseeable future. Themajority of future claims are likely to arise in relation to nationalisation ordeprivations of property under foreign municipal law. There is a continuing needfor officers skilled in claims work.334. The small amount of claims work which has up to now arisen withinthe Commonwealth has not made it necessary to set up a separate claims section in the Commonwealth Relations Office. Most claims work relates and will, weimagine, continue to relate to foreign rather than Commonwealth countries. Wetherefore see no reason to call for a unified Foreign Office and commonwealth relations Office Claims Department. If, however, Commonwealth claims work should become greater in volume, we believe there would then be a case for anamalgamated claims organisation, as the machinery and processes of claims workvary little from country to country. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office ClaimsDepartment should remain in its present form, though its present established staff should become full members of the unified Service.
are required to have a good Honours degree. They form a specialist group and^promotion is. possible only within the&apos;cadre. There are, however, opportunities for service abroad. At present seven members of the Research cadre are at postsoverseas. The Research cadre is augmented by officers with specialist knowledgefrom the ordinary career service. Among other posts, that of Director of Research,which is combined with that of Librarian, is held by an officer of Branch A of theForeign Service. At present, the Deputy Director of Research is also a careermember of Branch A.338. We were told that, within the Research cadre, promotion prospects arenot good: a cadre of about 30 officers can allow only limited scope. It was put tous that, in order to improve career prospects, the post of Deputy Director should in future be filled by the promotion of a Research Assistant, the post thus becomingthe apex of a research career. We do not think that the Research cadre couldnecessarily expect promotion prospects of the same order as those of regular careerofficers; nor is there any sufficient reason why suitable members of. the careerservice should not do research work. But some outlet must be provided for membersof the Research cadre and we recommend that the post of Deputy Director of research should normally be held by one of its members.339. Members of the Research staff in both the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices should have close contact with other specialists working in thesame fields in universities and elsewhere. Exchanges of staff with universitiesshould be encouraged. Members of the research staff may be well suited toUndertake work at universities on a sabbatical basis and there is scope for university and other outside experts to work part-time in the Foreign and commonwealth Relations Offices. At the moment four senior university lecturersare working on this basis in the Foreign Office. This seems a useful arrangement.340. It was put to us by the Staff Side that rates of pay for members of the research cadre were inadequate and that more of the staff should be on an established basis. We are not in a position to make recommendations on either of these matters as they cannot be considered in isolation from conditions ofservice for equivalent officers in other Departments in Whitehall.341. The Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office staff threelibraries. The Foreign Office has its own library. The Commonwealth relations office shares a library with the Colonial Office and is responsible for the IndiaOffice Library. These three libraries are staffed partly by specialists and partly by members of the general service grades of the two Services.342. The Foreign Office Library has two main sections: a Printed Librarycontaining published material and a Reference Room which holds records morethan two years old. The staff of the Printed Library are mainly Home CivilServants, some of whom have professional qualifications as librarians. The staffof the Reference Room are largely career Foreign Service officers who may stay in the Reference Room only for a comparatively short period. It was put to us that, as a result, few members of the Reference Room had time to acquire detailedknowledge of the records kept or of the methods of indexing. It was also argued that the function of the Reference Room is specialist in character and that it canbe adequately discharged only by officers who have concentrated on that type ofwork. We think this a matter on which a balance must be struck. A proportion ofspecialists is clearly necessary. At the same time, it would be unreasonable to saythat places should never be found in the Library for career officers. There maywell be good reasons, for example, on grounds of health, for assigning a careerofficer for a spell of duty there. However, when a career officer is appointed to the library, he should be left there for a reasonable length of time.343. At present, the Library is a considerable distance away from the mainForeign Office building. This physical separation from the Research and otherdepartments of the Foreign Office is a handicap. Because the Library is not within easy reach full use is not made of the material available.344. There are good grounds for unifying the Research and Libraryfacilities of the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices. We see no reason why within the next few years a single Research Department should not beestablished. A single, unified Library will become possible only when new premises are built or found. When plans are drawn up, account should be taken of the
need to have the Library close at hand, if possible in the same building. Meanwhile,there seems to us to be a case for improving and modernising the standard of equipment in the present libraries.Registry and Archives Work345. One of the most important parts of any large organisation is themachinery for handling, recording and filing its correspondence and papers. Thisis of particular importance in world-wide organisations like the Foreign and commonwealth Services which each day receive and send out large numbersof telegrams, letters and despatches. This is the task of the Archives and Registrystaff of the two Services. It calls for speed, accuracy and reliability.346. Registry and archives arrangements within the Foreign Service andthe Commonwealth Service are not the same although their tasks differ hardlyat all. At home, responsibility in the Foreign Office for classifying and filingpapers rests with a self-contained Archives Department. This is numerically thelargest department in the Foreign Office with about 270 officers. The department,which is under the control of a Registrar, consists of central Classification, MainIndex and Training and Methods Branches as well as numerous CorrespondenceDivisions. The central branches receive, classify and allocate papers to executivedepartments. They also provide a central subject index and enforce uniformprocedures and methods. The correspondence divisions work directly to executivedepartments. Overseas, the registries where papers are classified and filed arean integral part of the posts or, in the case of the largest Embassies, of the sections they serve. The staff of registries abroad thus feel part of the operationalteam in a way which is less easy to achieve at home.347. The Commonwealth Relations Office, unlike the Foreign Office, hasno formal &quot; Archives Department&quot;. It runs its registry work more on the linesof a Home Civil Service Department. A Chief Registrar is responsible for theefficiency of the registry service. He controls all staff employed on registry workand those who handle incoming and outgoing mails. Overseas, broadly the sameprocedures apply.348. The Foreign and Commonwealth Services do not use the sameregistration and filing systems. The system used in the Commonwealth relations office and at Commonwealth Service and Trade Commission Service posts abroadis what is known as &quot; the Treasury system &quot;. The Foreign Office has developedits own system to meet its special requirements and those of Foreign Officeposts overseas.349. It is clear to us that these divergences of method should not continue in the unified Service. We recommend that, in the new Service, there should be asingle registry and filing system at all posts and in the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices. We are not in a position to recommend which features of thetwo present systems should be carried over into the unified Service. We suggestthat, as a first step towards standardisation, a post of Senior Registrar should be created. This officer, with supporting staff, should be responsible to the Chiefof Administration for introducing the system to be made standard throughoutthe new Service. In this, the Senior Registrar should have the advice of organisation and Methods experts.350. It was suggested that, in the new Service, registry or correspondencedivisions should be formally attached to the executive departments they serveand not, as at present in the Foreign Office, be part of a self-contained butgeographically dispersed Archives Department. This change might improve morale and efficiency, in particular by creating more team-spirit between registries andthe departments they serve. On this plan, the subordination of registries toexecutive departments would not derogate from the responsibility of the SeniorRegistrar for the classification of papers and filing procedures. We recommend thatthis suggestion be given full consideration as part of the preparatory work to becarried out, under the Chief of Administration, by the Senior Registrar with the help of Organisation and Methods experts.351. The Senior Registrar would also be in charge of a combined ArchivesTraining Section. Subject to the general direction and authority of the combinedTraining Department, this section would train all staff assigned to archives andregistry work at home and overseas.
CHAPTER FOURRECRUITMENTRegular Recruitment352. In this section we consider primarily recruitment into theAdministrative, Executive and Clerical Classes, corresponding to Branches Aand B of the present Foreign Service. Questions of recruitment into other brancheshave been considered in the sections in Chapter Three dealing with those branches.353. The regulations for entry into Branch A of the Foreign Service and theAdministrative Class of the Commonwealth Service at the normal age* givecandidates a choice of two types of competition, Method I and Method II.Method I has some resemblance to the traditional pre-war type of examination;there is a short qualifying examination in general subjects followed by an interviewbefore a Final Board and written papers in academic subjects at honours degreelevel. Candidates with first class honours degrees who do well in the qualifyingexamination and interview may be exempted from the written examination.354. Method II has three parts. First, there is a short qualifying examination,with the same papers as in Method I; candidates with first class honours degreesare exempted. The second stage is at the Civil Service Selection Board (C.S.S.B.)where candidates take a series of written and oral tests. These include group testsand individual interviews. The C.S.S.B. process lasts two and a half days. AtC.S.S.B. it is possible to obtain a full picture of a candidate^ personality and ability and to relate this to his record at school and university and in the Forces. The third stage is an interview before the Final Selection Board. Representatives from bothinside and outside the public service sit on this Board. Whereas in Method I theFinal Board mark is not decisive but is added to the mark for the written work,the Final Selection Board in Method II awards a mark which determines successor failure in the competition as a whole. In awarding this mark, the Board takes account of the candidate^ intellectual and personal qualities as shown by hisrecord and by his performance in all stages of the competition. To be successfulby Method II, candidates must have, or obtain in the year of the competition, a firstor second class honours degree.355. The annual pattern of recruitment by means of these two Methods intothe Senior Branch (Branch A) of the Foreign Service and into the administrative class of the Home Civil Service, including the Commonwealth Service, is shownin Annex I. This shows the number of advertised vacancies each year and thenumber of successes. The number of applicants each year has greatly exceeded thenumber of advertised places. The ratio of applicants to successful candidates forthe Foreign Service in 1962 was 17 to 1. The Foreign and Commonwealth services have always been able to attract a wide range of candidates for the posts theyoffer. The annual rate of recruitment, however, has fluctuated considerably. Therehave been periods when recruitment was below requirements. In some yearscandidates of the right quality have been scarce. The First Civil service commissioner assured us that standards for acceptance had remained constant.356. At present, the Commonwealth Service is regarded as part of theHome Civil Service for purposes of recruitment. It seems to us illogical to treat an overseas Service like the Commonwealth Service in this way. Oneadvantage of the formation of a single Diplomatic Service with a single recruitingsystem is that it will do away with this illogicality. We have had to ask ourselves,however, whether recruitment to the overseas Services as a whole is likely to beaffected by a unified system. The best evidence we have been able to obtain from representatives of the Civil Service Commission and of the Universities isthat no particular recruiting problem will be caused. Indeed, a Service offering a career in both foreign and Commonwealth countries could well prove more attractive to candidates.2g I For both the Foreign Service and Home Civil Service,9S   j    including Commonwealth Service.In 1964:/20-28 for the Home Civil Service;\ 20-27 for the Foreign Service.

357. In the past, most candidates for the Commonwealth Service have alsobeen candidates for the Foreign Service, though some expressed a special interestin serving in the Commonwealth. A small proportion, however, have competedfor the Commonwealth Service only. Of these, some may have felt a positiveattraction for the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Service. Others mayhave opted for the Commonwealth Service because they lacked languages or,it has been suggested, because they thought they might have fewer, or less difficult,social obligations to face in Commonwealth countries than they would have inforeign countries. It might therefore be suggested that a unified Service, with an obligation to serve in foreign countries as well as the Commonwealth, might detersome candidates of the kind whose preference in the past has been for theCommonwealth only. We do not believe this need be so. So far as the languageproblem is concerned, arrangements already have to be made to teach foreignlanguages to most new entrants to the Foreign Service. There would therefore beno special difficulty in extending this to cover recruits who, if there were nounified Diplomatic Service, might have chosen to enter the Commonwealth Service.It is in any case clear that, in a unified Service, particular care will have to be takenin planning the careers of individual members and in selecting and training officers for particular forms of service in the light of their personal interests and aptitudes.An officer who shows himself particularly interested in and fitted for handlingCommonwealth problems should have every opportunity to specialise in them.358. Thus it seems that the inclusion of the Commonwealth Service withina new Diplomatic Service will not bring about any major change in the pattern of recruitment. The question now is whether the pattern itself is right and what scopethere is for maintaining and improving recruitment in respect of both numbers and quality.359. There is a continued interest in the public service at universities. Butthe service faces increasingly stiff competition from other employers. It cannotreckon to get effortlessly and.automatically the full number of high quality recruitsit needs. The main sources of competition vary from time to time. Once indusrty was the main competitor. At the moment, however, the universities themselves arethe more formidable competitors. The growth of existing universities and thecreation of new ones has opened up the possibility of an academic career to alarger proportion of good university graduates. We have been advised, however,that, in spite of competition, it will be possible to recruit at the required ratewithout lowering standards.360. The suggestion was made to us that the standards at present looked forin recruits for Branch A of the Foreign Service and the Administrative Class ofthe Commonwealth Service might be a shade too high. All examination andinterview methods are fallible and it is no doubt true that some good people donot succeed in the present competitions. A surprisingly large number of candidatesfail the preliminary qualifying examination and some of these might have made good in an overseas career. But some test is clearly necessary to reduce tomanageable proportions the number of candidates to be interviewed at C.S.S.B.and this form of preliminary test provides initial evidence of intellectual quality and powers of clear and concise expression on paper. We suspect that many morecandidates could pass the qualifying examination if they took more trouble to acquaint themselves with the requirements of the examination and the type of questions set. The subject matter is broad enough, and the examination tests skills,for example, in writing and comprehension, which members of the overseas services will need.361. Nor do we think that good candidates by Method II are being rejected as a result of the C.S.S.B. tests. The alternative of Method I is available for thosewho feel that Method II may not suit them. Candidates who fail by Method IIcan succeed by Method I.362. It would be a serious mistake to lower standards of entry. The work ofthe Diplomatic Service will call for high intellectual and personal qualities and thecountry cannot afford to accept a lower quality of recruit. We do not in anycase want to make it easier, as a lowering of standards would do, for men who areplausible, but are not of more than average intellectual ability, to gain admission.A successful candidate by Method II should continue to be required to have asecond class degree as an assurance of academic ability. With this safeguard,Method II is well suited to ensure that successful candidates have not only academic
vital step, in which the Appointments Boards can be of great help, is to securethe interest of the teaching staff, especially in those universities where there is atutorial system. We cannot rate too highly the importance of contact with the teaching staff; it is they who are best placed to influence their good students inthe choice of a career. The aim should be to build up at individual universities atradition of expecting to provide recruits fairly regularly to the new diplomatic service. Even a single success from a university can be sufficient to stimulate interest,particularly if good use is made of the new recruit by sending him back as an officialevangelist.374. Complementary to entry into Branch A of the Foreign Service, therehas for some time been a limited amount of recruitment of university graduatesinto Branch B. A special competition has been introduced with the object of attracting those who would be particularly suitable for training for information,commercial and consular duties. This competition has been successful in attractingcandidates from a wider range of universities. Of the fifteen candidates declaredsuccessful in the 1963 competition, five were educated at London University, threeat Dublin, two at Cambridge and one each at Belfast, Glasgow, St. Andrews,Southampton and the University of Natal, though later three of them declinedappointments. We strongly recommend that a special competition of this typeshould form a prominent part in the recruiting arrangements of the newDiplomatic Service.375. Although the work assigned to graduate recruits in Branch B of theForeign Service has been worthy of their mettle, we suspect that the idea of applying for a vacancy in the less senior branch has in itself proved a deterrent tosome potential candidates. We have had this much in mind in devising the newgrades structure and in the improved arrangements for &quot; bridging&quot; which wehave recommended (paras. 101 et seq.). We hope that university-educated menand women who feel they are unable to pass an examination for entry intoGrade 8 of the new Diplomatic Service will have less hesitation in applying to becandidates for entry into Grade 9. We believe that a competition of this kind forGrade 9 of the new Service could do much to stimulate a wider field of universityrecruitment. If, in addition, it is possible to arrange a fair method by which suitablecandidates who do not quite come up to the standard of entry to the new Grade 8can be offered entry into Grade 9 without taking part in a further competition,this would, we think, be beneficial to the new Service and might at the same timeimprove the rate of recruitment from all universities.Over-age Entry376. Supplementary competitions for Branch A of the Foreign Service havebeen held annually since 1947 for candidates over the normal age limits. For thiscompetition, which is designed to attract experienced candidates from such sourcesas the Forces and H.M. Oversea Civil Service, the Foreign Office prescribes a listof specialist qualifications^ The upper age limit is thirty-five with an extension to forty-five for former members of the Services and of the Oversea Civil Service.In the years from 1959 to 1962 the Foreign Service took twenty-three entrantsfrom this competition, eleven from the Oversea Civil Service.377. The Civil Service Commission held a special over-age competition forPrincipal posts in the Commonwealth Service for the first time in 1962, thoughposts in the Service had been filled from four previous over-age competitions forthe Home Civil Service as a whole. Like the over-age competitions for the foreign service, this special competition dispensed with a formal written examination.Special attention was paid to the nature and quality of candidates&apos; previous experience.* Preference is given to candidates who, in addition to the basic qualities of intellect and personalityrequired, have experience or knowledge of matters of particular use to the Foreign Service. these include:(a) A knowledge of a Middle Eastern, African or Oriental language;(b) Experience of Africa or South-East Asia;(c) A knowledge of economic, commercial, or financial matters;(d) A scientific education or background;(e) Experience of journalism or public relations;(/) Post-graduate academic experience, especially work on some aspect of foreign or public affairs.
378. There should be no difficulty in continuing to run this type of over-agecompetition for the new Diplomatic Service. It provides an excellent method of recruiting older people with useful experience. The special talents sought by meansof the competition can be varied from time to time according to the changingneeds of the Service. If emphasis continues to be placed on special experience, this need not exclude the good all-rounder. The main factor likely to limit the usefulnessof this type of competition is the natural reluctance of good people to enter for it if they are already making a success of their existing careers. There is no advantage in providing a means of entry for proved misfits from other walks of life.379. Recently, the running down of the Oversea Civil Service has provided a valuable source of recruitment to both the Foreign and Commonwealth Services.There are numerical limitations to the extent to which these Services or the newDiplomatic Service can provide an answer to the problem of finding newemployment for members of the Oversea Civil Service. In any case, not all who might wish to join the new Service will be found suitable. Others will not wish totake up a second overseas career. Nevertheless, the over-age competition can beof some assistance towards resettlement.Executive and Clerical Recruitment380. The creation of a unified Diplomatic Service will not adversely affectrecruitment to the Executive grades. Indeed, we were advised that it might wellhelp recruitment at this level. The various channels into the Executive grades andthe educational and other requirements should be clearly defined. The examinationfor graduate entrants into Grade 9 should be distinct from, but complementary to,the competition for non-graduate entry at that level. There should also be acompetition or competitions for the new Diplomatic Service specially designed for candidates between the ages of 17  and 20. These should be on the lines of thecompetitions now held for Grade B5 of the Foreign Service and for the ExecutiveClass of the Home Civil Service including the Commonwealth Relations Office.381. Good Executive recruits straight from school must not be discouraged by the graduate competition for the new Grade 9. There will be ample room and opportunity for both graduate and non-graduate entrants. The new grades structureshould make it easier to test the suitability of Executive entrants for &quot; bridging &quot;irrespective of the examination by which they entered.382. The quality of Clerical recruits varies greatly, but the main problem isthe high rate of turn-over. About a third of each year&apos;s intake of school leaversresign before reaching the age of 21, the age by which they are fully trained and become eligible for overseas service. The answer to this problem is not to permitthese young people to be posted abroad earlier. To some extent the problem reflects the unwillingness of young people generally to settle down until they have triedout several jobs. We think, however, that it would be wise in the Diplomatic service to lay greater emphasis on the recruitment of the older type of Clerical recruit.More mature recruits, for example those with a pension from a previous career,settle down well as Clerical Officers, especially at posts abroad. This type of clerical Officer is a good investment.Evenness of Recruitment383. We wish to stress the importance of an even flow of recruitment to allgrades of the new Diplomatic Service. Uneven recruitment such as occurred in thenineteen-forties and fifties leads to shortages in some age groups and surpluses in others, difficulties of deployment, disruption of training programmes and promotionblockages. All these are bad for morale and for efficiency. Particular care shouldbe taken in the methods used to make good gaps caused by serious under-recruitment in any series of years. If such gaps are made good all at once, furtherpromotion blockages can be caused. The recruitment of officers on a contract basisis, as a rule, a better method of filling gaps which cannot be filled by recruitingestablished officers of approximately the right age-group. Such temporary recruitsshould not normally be retained for more than five years.Lateral Entry384. The public service as a whole is sometimes accused of being too closeda society. The apprehension is that, after recruitment, members of the public service
are too cut off from outside thought, experience and influences. There is something in this view. It is, however, fair to acknowledge that the public service is not alone in this tendency to form &quot; closed societies &quot;. It is a characteristic of British life notto welcome or encourage free movement between one profession or way of. life &quot;andanother. Be that as it may, the new D iplomatic Service would be enriched andinvigorated by closer contact with the universities, cultural and other organisationsactive in the field of foreign affairs and the world of business. The most promisingpossibilities lie in the direction of setting up joint study groups in which men and-women from outside Whitehall work together with members of governmentDepartments. We made proposals for this in our remarks on policy planning(paras. 228-229). Another valuable means of helping the Diplomatic Service tobroaden and deepen their views is to send selected officers to spend sabbaticalperiods at universities; we look at this possibility in our recommendations on training (para. 442). At this point, we wish to examine the contribution whichmight be made by a policy of freer recruitment comparatively late in life of menand women with experience gained in other fields.385. There is already the &quot; over-age &quot; competition, through which those with special experience of interest to the Foreign Service can enter on a permanent basis. We have said that this competition should be retained as a regular feature of the recruiting mechanism of the Diplomatic Service. It may well attract, among others, a proportion of young research fellows who, after some years in universitywork, decide against a life of scholarship. We do not think, however, that it wouldbe practicable to recruit for a permanent career men and women over the age of thirty-five in any large numbers. Few men and women who are doing well in othercareers will want to transfer permanently. In any case, an over-age competition ofany size would prejudice the reasonable career prospects of regular entrants and could have an adverse effect on the main stream of recruitment. The newDiplomatic Service must cater, however, for occasions when a particular need calls for a man or woman with special qualifications who would welcome a permanenttransfer. In such cases, the recruiting machinery of the Civil Service commission would, we hope, be sufficiently flexible to make appropriate arrangements.386. We see greater scope for borrowing university and other talent for aperiod of. temporary service. Universities and firms normally find it difficult to release men and women of high promise or attainments for more than one or twoyears. But, we believe, in many cases this would be long enough to be of value. such temporary periods of service have many advantages not possessed by a system ofpermanent transfer and should prove attractive to both sides. For the overseas service there is the advantage of being able to use men and women with a freshapproach and recent close contact with outside opinions. Those appointed from outside will be able to learn something of the governmental approach to problemswithin their fields of interest. Moreover, since the appointments will be temporary,they will not damage the career structure of the Diplomatic Service; and, since they/ill normally be for no more than two years, they will not make a serious break inthe professional careers of those who come in from outside. A further advantage isthat contacts made in this way between Whitehall and universities and businessfirms can be maintained when the periods of attachment come to an end.387. The Foreign Service already takes men from both universities andthe business world on such a temporary basis. More must, however, be done,particularly in arranging temporary periods of service for men and women whohave a fairly senior rank in their own profession. Recruitment of this kind willnot happen of its own accord. Able people already successful in an academic or business career and happy in it will not be found knocking on the door of agovernment Department to offer their services. A number of them might, however,welcome a period of public service if the need for it were put to them and ifthe tasks they were to be given were carefully chosen to correspond directly with their special talents.388. These arrangements can apply at all levels, including the most senior.Ambassadors and High Commissioners are sometimes appointed from outsidethe career public service. Appointments of this kind can be notably succesful and should continue to be made from time to time as opportunity offers. such appointments should, however, be the exception rather than the rule.
IllQAttached and Seconded Staff389. Whereas an attached officer remains on the pay-roll and the strengthof the Department from which he comes, a seconded officer is transferred, forthe period of his secondment, to the strength and pay-roll of the overseas department. There are at present 206 Attaches or Assistant Attaches serving atmissions in foreign countries and 67 Advisers or Assistant Advisers serving atMissions in Commonwealth countries. Service Attaches and Advisers are drawn from the Armed Forces and Civilian Attaches and Advisers from home departments. Attaches and Advisers are at present allocated as follows:Foreign        CommonwealthPosts PostsNaval, Military and Air Attaches and advisers and their Assistants         ... 124 42Civilian Attaches/Advisers and Assistants 82 25Comprising:Labour   ............ 14 civil Air............ 7 2Scientific......... 8 4Atomic Energy......... 2  Supply    ............ 3Agricultural      ......... 5 3Veterinary        ......... 3  Petroleum        ......... 1  Shipping............ 3 1Colonial............ 3  Financial......      ...... 8 2Pensions............   defence Research       ...... 3  Cultural............ 22 6Detailed notes and observations about the functions of the main categories of civilian Attaches and Advisers are given at Annex P.390. There are, in addition, Ministry of Works representatives at fifteenForeign Service posts, some of whom have one or more assistants, and six Ministryof Works representatives at Commonwealth Service posts.391. We are satisfied that there are posts in both foreign and commonwealth countries which require the full-time services of experts qualified in certain highlytechnical subjects. We are speaking here of the kind of technical knowledge and experience which goes beyond specialisation in the sense in which we haveused the term in relation to career officers of the overseas Services. It would notbe possible for career members of the Diplomatic Service to master thesetechnical subjects in a reasonable time and, even if they were to master them,their new knowledge would not be fully utilised in the rest of their careers. Wetherefore consider that at large Missions the Diplomatic Service should continueto rely for technical expertise of this kind on officers specially detached from the armed Forces and from home Departments. The present scale of attachment isin our view about right, although in some categories there may be a case for a modest increase.392. There must, however, be a clear need for the full-time attention of an expert before any specialist appointment of this kind is made. Otherwise, thenumber of specialist officers brought in from other Departments might become so large as to be out of scale with the central core of the Mission as a whole. Thisis a danger which needs to be guarded against. An Attache, by reason of hisnarrower technical function, is not as versatile as a member of the Foreign or commonwealth Services.&quot;He is not normally expected, as a member of theForeign or Commonwealth Services is, to turn his hand to any subject in whichhis Mission may be heavily involved. If, therefore, a Mission were composed toa disproportionate extent of specialist officers from other Departments, it wouldlack flexibility and be uneconomical in its use of manpower. As a general rule,it is sufficient to allocate work which otherwise might be done by an Attacheto members of the career Diplomatic Service, arranging for an expert to payable visit from London if occasion demands it.393. When it is necessary for specialist officers from home departments or elsewhere to be appointed to overseas missions, they must be fully integratedinto the team of the Head of Mission under whom they are to serve. They shouldnot feel either that they are not accepted as members of the team or that they
have some kind of independent mission of their own. Moreover, they shouldhave, for the period of their overseas appointments, conditions of service which,in all relevant respects, are the same as those of their colleagues in the diplomatic service. These considerations prompt us to make a recommendation which webelieve to be of substance. We propose that, in future, all civilian staff selected for service at Foreign Office or Commonwealth Relations Office posts should besent out on secondment and not on attachment. Special considerations, however,arise in the case of Service Attaches generally and the staff of the United KingdomTreasury and Supply Delegation in Washington which make it inappropriate toinclude them within the scope of this recommendation. Nor do we propose thatBritish Council Representatives serving as Cultural Attaches should be seconded.394. If most civilian officers who are now attached to overseas Missions arein future seconded, they will more easily be regarded as and feel themselves to be inall respects full members of the staff of the Ambassador or High Commissioner.This change need not cause any alteration in the arrangement by which specialistofficers from other Departments correspond directly with their home department on matters of a non-political character. Attaches are already instructed onappointment to place themselves under the orders of their Head of Mission andare reminded that they do not hold an independent post but form part of her majesty&apos;s Mission. To this extent then, the impact of the change we propose willbe primarily psychological. But it will be none the less important for that.A seconded officer feels more directly responsible to the Head of Mission and istherefore all the more useful.395. A further advantage would be that the change would simplifyaccounting arrangements and make for simpler administration at overseas posts.Moreover, if civilian officers from home Departments serve in overseas missionson secondment only, a radical simplification of their terms of service will become possible. It is most undesirable that officers from different Departments servingwithin a single Mission should have, as at present, conditions of service which areirrationally and inexplicably different from those of their colleagues. All unjustifieddifferences would be removed by the adoption of secondment as the normalmethod of appointing civilian officers from home Departments to serve at overseasMissions. We make detailed recommendations in Chapter Six (paras. 572-581).396. An allocation of posts for seconded officers would have to be added tothe establishment of the Diplomatic Service. These posts should be kept separate from the rest of the Serviced staff complement. Any changes in the allocationwould require Treasury approval. It would continue to be for the sponsoringDepartment in Whitehall to make the initial proposal for a post to the Treasury.397. Under our proposal, some change in nomenclature would become necessary. For example, a Labour Attache or Adviser would become Counsellor(Labour) or First Secretary (Labour) according to his rank. This should occasionno difficulty. Indeed, in some cases officers serving with an overseas Mission havealready made special arrangements to adopt this form of address in preference to the title Attache.Service Attaches and Advisers398. We do not think it would be practicable for Naval, Military and AirAttaches and Advisers and their Assistants to be treated as seconded officers in theway we have suggested for civilian Attaches. Conditions of service and amenitiesprovided for members of the Armed Forces as well as their system of remunerationare fundamentally different from those of civilians. Given the basic differences between the military and civilian systems, it would create more problems than itwould solve if Service Attaches were to be seconded to the overseas departments and to become subject to the general run of conditions of service applicable to thenew Diplomatic Service. Moreover, the practice of appointing and receiving service attaches is a time-honoured one to which overseas governments have becomeaccustomed. A unilateral step on our part to change the system might give riseto misunderstandings and have the effect of restricting the usefulness of our service attaches.399. In general we found at the posts we visited that Service Attaches and advisers were doing useful work which was highly valued by their Ambassadors andCONFIDENTIAL3610 L
2/J--2-High Commissioners as well as by the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices.Naval, Military and Air Attaches and their Assistants are primarily appointed forintelligence purposes but have many other duties. Of these, the primary task is tomaintain links with the Armed Forces of the countries to which they are accreditedand to act as a channel for the exchange of military information. They also handlerequests for training facilities in this country and help to promote sales of british equipment. They arrange naval and other visits. Service Attaches are under theorders of the Head of Mission and form an integral part of his staff. our recommendation that they should remain on attachment rather than onsecondment is not intended to imply any weakening of this relationship.400. In Commonwealth countries there are either Military Liaison Missionsor Service Advisers. Their relationship to High Commissioners is the same as the relationship of Service Attaches to Ambassadors and we recommend no change inthis. In many Commonwealth countries, a high proportion of the work consists ofgiving technical advice or arranging training programmes.401. Service Attaches can represent more than one of the three ArmedServices and be accredited to several countries. The optimum size of their parishdepends on a variety of local circumstances and may change considerably fromtime to time. We heard some criticism of the system of accrediting Service, and indeed other, Attaches to more than one country. Attaches should not be askedto be responsible for a larger parish than they can cover effectively but it will, inour view, sometimes be manageable as well as economical for an Attache to covermore than one country. This will sometimes be better than leaving an importantarea without such representation altogether.402. Where an Air Attache has to cover a large number of countries, especially if local air communications are unreliable, he should, if possible, be equipped withan aircraft. Where an aircraft is provided, it should of course be available for dutyjourneys by other members of the staff, particularly the Head of Mission himself.403. There is room for improvement in the procedure by which the need for service Attaches at particular posts is assessed. Present difficulties seem to stemlargely from the fact that Service Attaches and Advisers have hitherto been borne on the votes of the individual Service Departments and not on the Vote of theMinistry of Defence. In the past, the Directors of Intelligence have been at pains to co-operate with each other and with the overseas Departments in trying to workout the most effective, economical and mutually acceptable disposition of service attaches and Advisers. It is not easy to reach conclusions which satisfy all thedifferent interests involved. This is especially true at times when economies haveto be achieved and there is particular difficulty, by reason of financial restrictions,in meeting all requests for the appointment of Service Attaches. At such times, thespecial requirements of parent Departments are bound to carry the greatest weight,especially if they control the purse strings. The creation of unified defence staffs,as announced in the White Paper (Cmd. 2097) on Central Organisation for Defence,should lead to the reform and improvement of the methods and machinery by whichrequirements for Service Attaches and Advisers are assessed as between serviceinterests. There will still, however, be a need to give greater weight than at present to political and commercial considerations in determining the need for service attaches and Advisers at particular posts. It is often invaluable, from a political point of view, for an Ambassador or High Commissioner to have at hand a Serviceofficer of the right age and with the right personal qualities. A way must be found of ensuring that the policy requirements of the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices are given weight in the new machinery for determining whereService Attaches and Advisers should be stationed.404. Improvements are also possible in the system of selecting service attaches and Advisers. It is essential to choose the right man. Service Attachesshould ideally be men who are going on to bigger things. A. tour as a Service Attacheshould not be the prelude to retirement, as sometimes still seems to be the case. a service Attache or Adviser must also come from the &quot; right &quot; Service in relation tothe needs of the post in question. There should be no rigid rule that the appointeeat a particular post should always come from a particular Armed Service and fromno other. If only one Service Attache can be appointed to a post, particular care should be taken to see that he comes from the Service which has the most tocontribute to the effectiveness of the Mission as a whole. An Air Attache would
obviously not be the best choice for a country or group of countries where the army is predominant or where it is likely to be possible to sell equipment for the Armyrather than for an Air Force.405. Age and rank are also important factors. The concept of a Senior Attachefrom one Service supported by a junior Attache from one of the other Services hasmuch to commend it. This arrangement will be particularly valuable in countries where the Armed Forces play a significant political role and where many of theleading &quot;personalities are young. We assume that this idea, or the alternative oneof having &quot; Defence Attaches &quot; rather than separate Naval, Military and AirAttaches, will be pressed forward by the new Ministry of Defence. Taking a broadview of the national requirements in this field, political and commercial as wellas military, we are convinced that a rationalisation of the present arrangements onthese lines would be an important advance.406. It was put to us that the help which Service Attaches and Advisers can give to companies selling aircraft or other military and civil products to foreign government is not sufficiently widely known to firms in this country. Major firmsselling military or other equipment are well aware of the help they can get from service Attaches but smaller firms may not always be, especially if their producthas civil as well as military uses. We recommend, that more should be done to make this function of Service Attaches more widely known; it is complementary to thework of commercial staff overseas.407. We recommend strongly that Service Attaches and their wives shouldbe given tuition in the local language before taking up their appointments.408. Although we have not felt it wise to recommend that Service Attachesand Advisers should in future be seconded to the new Diplomatic Service, weare convinced that it is a mistake to have unnecessary divergencies in conditionsof service, such as in qualifying periods for home leave. We also hope that everyeffort will be made at overseas posts to bring Service Attaches and their staffs withinthe scope of common administrative services and practices.

CHAPTER FIVETRAININGTraining and Manpower409. No matter how promising or talented a new recruit may be, he will notachieve his full potential and become a thoroughly proficient diplomatist withouthelp and guidance. He will need this help throughout his career, but particularlyin its early stages. He must acquire a balance of experience related to his ownaptitudes and the requirements of the Service; and he must have formal trainingin his profession. Those who have entered the Foreign and Commonwealth Servicessince the war have not, in our view, received their full measure of this help. Thereason is not a failure on the part of management to appreciate what was requirednor any lack of good intentions but the inadequacy of the resources of the two services. Both have been short of the resources, particularly of manpower, necessaryto translate good intentions into action.410. If the manpower resources of a service are over-stretched in relationto its commitments, training goes to the wall. Mere exhortations to give a higher priority to training cannot, in the nature of things, be enough to prevent this. It iseasy to say that an enlightened management ought not to agree to release officers to undertake duties for which they have not received the necessary training. Inpractice the demand to fill an urgent vacancy becomes irresistible and training isabbreviated or sacrificed altogether. The only remedy lies in the creation of the margin of manpower which we have recommended in paragraph 88. Within thismargin, a block of posts must be set aside for training. There should be enough ofthese posts and they should not be diverted to other purposes.411. Training in the overseas Services has cost remarkably little, partly because not enough has been done. The Commonwealth Relations Office spendsonly  4,200 a year on training. The Foreign Office now spends  40,000 a year onits Middle East Centre for Arab Studies (M.E.C.A.S.), the Arabic language schoolin the Lebanon; more than half of this sum is recovered in the form of the fees of non-Foreign Office students. Apart from expenditure on M.E.C.A.S., theForeign Office spends less than  25,000 a year on training programmes. It maybe unfair to make direct comparisons, but the annual cost of the United StatesForeign Service Institute is in excess of  1,600,000. It would be unrealistic to propose expenditure on this kind of scale. It is, however, clear that the diplomatic service will need to spend appreciably more than the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices do at present if it is to train its staff properly.412. The new Service should also, we recommend, have authority to assessand meet its training requirements within a total sum allotted to it for training purposes. Under present arrangements, the Foreign and Commonwealth RelationsOffices have a series of detailed and specific authorisations from the Treasury,allowing them to train a certain number of officers in certain categories in certainways each year. This is not flexible enough. What is needed is a total annual sum for training to be allocated to the Diplomatic Service for use at its discretion. Thetotal sum would be negotiated with the Treasury; the new Service would be fullyaccountable for what it spent.The relationship of Training to Specialisation and Career Planning413. There is more to training than having the necessary staff and thenecessary money. The nature and extent of training required is directly related tothe system of specialisation adopted in the Diplomatic Service. Training will haveto be arranged so as to provide the right number of officers who have acquiredthe various skills the new Service has to have at its disposal; and it must beconsciously related to the probable and desirable pattern of the career of each individual officer. Thus, training and career planning go hand in hand.414. Although young officers should be given experience in their early yearsof a number of different aspects of the work, the aim must be to form an idea assoon as possible of their individual aptitudes and abilities. Only in this way can
the new Service avoid wasting training resources and be able to devote the greatestweight of effort to training officers for types of work for which they are particularlysuited and which they are likely to perform for long enough to justify the training.This makes sense in terms of finance, efficiency and morale. Expert knowledgecan not only enhance an officer&apos;s value but give him self-confidence and a sense of professional status. A carefully planned system of specialist training can be of help here.415. Career planning needs particular attention. No single member of theAdministration can hope to know personally everybody in each grade. This makesan orderly system of career planning essential. The objects of such a system shouldbe to ensure that(a) the best possible use is made of the talents and aptitudes of each individualofficer;(b) all members of the Service feel that their careers are being directed in a planned and intelligent manner and not haphazardly;(c) the Service is adequately equipped with specialists and that expertknowledge is properly distributed within it;(d) officers who rise to positions of special responsibility will have had a wideand balanced experience, including specialist experience.Against this background, we now consider Various aspects of training.Training on the job416. Despite the value of formal training courses, it remains true that thebest way to acquire professional competence is by actually doing the job, both at home and abroad, under the guidance of good chiefs. There are those whobelieve that learning the job by having to do it is the only worth-while form oftraining. We do not subscribe to this view in its entirety. There are many things,beginning with a knowledge Of languages, a member of the overseas Services oughtto have before he takes up any appointment and for these specific training isnecessary. The absence of such training can only mean that an officers usefulnessat a post is much less than it ought to be, particularly in the first year or so ofhis appointment.417. Nevertheless, no amount of specific training can dispense with the needfor members of the overseas Services to learn their job by serving an apprenticeshipin a variety of junior posts at home and overseas. In the process they must begiven guidance and instruction by experienced officers. The increase in the volumeof work in the Foreign and Commonwealth Services and the speed at whichbusiness nowadays is transacted has made training on the job harder than once itwas. Senior officers have, we think, sometimes failed to find time to take juniorsthrough their work, point out their errors and show them how it should be done.Many senior officers, under pressure of time, find it easier to take over the workthemselves. This may sometimes be inevitable but as a general practice it is a mistake. Senior officers should, we feel, be reminded of their personal responsibilityfor the practical training and guidance of the juniors working under them. It isparticularly important that the immediate superiors of junior officers the Headsof Chancery and Heads of Sections in Embassies and High Commissions andequivalent ranks in Departments at home should give continuous attention tothis side of their responsibilities. We hope that the proposals we have made on manpower will make it easier for them to do so. For we believe that, with the help of their seniors, good officers train themselves to a considerable extent. Butit will still be necessary for the Administration to give them other opportunities to learn by means of formal training courses.Introductory training418. It is not easy to judge how much initial training new entrants to theAdministrative Class (Branch A) should receive before being given a job of work todo. The 1943 White Paper (Cmd. 6420) on the Reform of the Foreign Serviceproposed that there should be two examinations, separated by a period of18 months&apos; study abroad at public expense and followed by a further year&apos;sprobationary training in this country. This plan was never carried out and was from the first impracticable, if only because the manpower which such a scheme would require has never been available. Instead, all that new entrants to the
Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices have been given by way ofintroductory training is a joint course lasting three weeks. This course has the limited aim of giving new entrants a general idea of the work of the two services at home and abroad and of the major problems of foreign and Commonwealthpolicy. Thereafter, about half the new entrants to the Foreign Office are putstraight on to learning a &quot;hard&quot; language. The rest, in some cases after athree-month course in French, German or Spanish, are given a fortnights trainingin archives procedures before taking up a regular post, usually in London. Thismeans that the knowledge which an officer taking up a post for the first time mayhave of languages, history, international relations, economics and developments inscience can vary greatly. It will depend largely on what he has read at university and learned, perhaps from travel abroad, before entering the public service.419. We asked ourselves whether the new Diplomatic Service ought tointroduce a more ambitious programme of introductory training on the lines ofthe 1943 proposals or on the lines of the training given to French public servantsthrough L&apos;Ecole Nationale d&apos;Administration (E.N.A.). Taking first the proposals put forward in 1943, we think that a system of two and a half years&apos; study at public expense before any work at all is done is both costly and undiscriminating. If all new entrants were to be given the same course, some would be repeating studieswhich they had taken, perhaps in much greater detail, at university. Second, mostnew entrants, who come direct from concentrated studies at school and university,unbroken now by national service, are impatient of further periods of academicstudies on first taking up their duties. Third, university graduates of the qualityrequired for the Diplomatic Service are not likely to accept a system under whichthey would not know whether they had been finally accepted until at leasteighteen months after passing the original entry examination. The introduction ofa further examination would, in our view, drive many candidates into the arms of other employers who do not insist on such an arrangement. Moreover, we are convinced that the main emphasis of the training programmes of the new service should not be on lengthy preliminary training of a rather generalised characterbut on giving officers training throughout their careers in the linguistic andtechnical skills they will need in their next appointment.420. The French Ecole Nationale d&apos;Administration has justly attractedattention as an imaginative and thorough experiment in the training of publicadministrators. It has produced administrators who have made their mark in french and European public life. We would not presume to try to assess E.N.A.in relation to the requirements which it was established to serve; it was designedto fit a particular pattern of education and administration. We are concerned only with the question of its application and relevance to contemporary Britishconditions. In this respect, many of the comments we have made on the trainingproposals in the 1943 White Paper apply equally to the E.N.A. It would beextravagant to give recruits to the Diplomatic Service a period of preliminarytraining as long as three years, much of it spent in studying and practisingthe work of an administrator in home affairs. Again, under the French system, arecruit does not know until after the examination at the end of his second year oftraining whether he will finally be accepted. As we have said, candidates in britain would find such a limitation hard and such an arrangement could only serve tomake it more difficult to recruit high-quality candidates, in the face of stiffcompetition from the academic and industrial world.421. We were interested to receive evidence about the Centre for adminsitrative Studies in London, recently established by the Treasury. Membersof the Home Civil Service Administrative Class are to attend this Centre after about two years of departmental experience. The idea is that after two years atwork young civil servants will no longer be as impatient of courses of backgroundknowledge and training as when they first joined the service. And, after two years&apos;experience, they are better able to appreciate the relevance to their work ofbackground courses. These considerations will apply equally to new members ofthe Diplomatic Service.422. At present, three members of the Foreign Service are attending the initial fourteen-week course at the Centre. Their experience will provide information on the extent to which the course, which is at present designedmainly for Home Civil Servants, is also relevant to the needs of the overseasrepresentational services. Many of the subjects in the present curriculum seem
relevant to these needs. The curriculum includes public administration, the structure of industry, the operation of business enterprise, science and technology,statistics, the international scene and economics. The seven-week extension coursedesigned for staff from economic Departments on such questions as the balance ofpayments, economic forecasting and reporting, incomes growth and planning islikely to be even more valuable.423. What we should like to see develop is a special course, if possilbe within the new Centre, for members of the Diplomatic Service in about their third or fourth year of service, This course would concentrate on practical aspectsof subjects of particular interest and relevance to their Work. It might includeeconomics and finance, international trade and payments, Parliamentary andadministrative problems, and something of the background of science, togetherwith international and Commonwealth affairs. Alternatively, it might prove possible for the general course at the Centre to be adapted more closely to theneeds of officers of the Diplomatic Service. If, as we hope, training at the Centrecan be provided for all new and recent entrants to the Administrative Class ofthe Diplomatic Service, we should like to see the Service associated in themanagement of the Centre.424. We believe also, that when the manpower position permits, it wouldbe useful, after their short period of initial training, for young officers to be sent for a period of up to about a year to large Embassies. There they would work assupernumeraries, spending perhaps three months in each of the main sections ofthe Embassy.425. There are also introductory courses for all Executive and Clerical classentrants. These should continue and be related as closely as possible to the kinds of work which the officers concerned are likely to be required to do, particularlyin the early stages of their careers.Training for overseas postings426. The greatest single contribution which a training programme can makeis to give effective preparatory training to each officer before he takes up anyappointment abroad. We recommend, therefore, that as a general rule each officerselected for transfer to another post, and officers seconded to the Service, shouldbe placed for a period within the responsibility of the unified Training Department.This Department should equip each officer for his new duties. The period oftraining should be of any length up to about three months. The period would vary according to the qualifications already possessed by the officer and those needed in his new appointment. For example, a junior officer with no previous SouthAmercan experience appointed to an Information post at Caracas or Lima wouldbe given an intensive Spanish course as well as training in information techniques and general briefing about developments in Latin America and British policythere. These periods of &quot;pre-post&quot; training are necessary for all officers but willbe particularly valuable for former Commonwealth and Trade Commission service officers whose experience will have been mainly in English-speaking countries.427. &quot;Pre-post&quot; training is of greatest importance for officers who haverepresentational work to perform; but the aim should be to give some preparatorytraining of this kind to all home-based staff before they go abroad. Part of this&quot; pre-post&quot; training should be made available to wives; we must not forget thepart wives have to play abroad and they must be helped to play it well. Languagetraining in particular should be given to wives, though not on a full-timeresidential basis. There is, however, one anomaly we should like to remove. Thisis that, as a general rule, wives are entitled to fewer language lessons at public expense than their husbands. In future, husbands and wives should be entitled tothe same number of lessons.428. At present, junior officers who have never served abroad before, andtheir wives, are given what is called a &quot; Going Abroad &quot; course. This explainswhat they may expect and what will be expected of them in their overseasappointments. These courses are valuable and should be extended to cover all members of the new Diplomatic Service.
relevant to these needs. The curriculum includes public administration, the structure of industry, the operation of business enterprise, science and technology,statistics, the international scene and economics. The seven-week extension coursedesigned for staff from economic Departments on such questions as the balance ofpayments, economic forecasting and reporting, incomes growth and planning islikely to be even more valuable.423. What we should like to see develop is a special course, if possilbe within the new Centre, for members of the Diplomatic Service in about their third or fourth year of service. This course would concentrate on practical aspectsof subjects of particular interest and relevance to their work. It might includeeconomics and finance, international trade and payments, Parliamentary andadministrative problems, and something of the background of science, togetherwith international and Commonwealth affairs. Alternatively, it might prove possible for the general course at the Centre to be adapted more closely to theneeds of officers of the Diplomatic Service. If, as we hope, training at the Centrecan be provided for all new and recent entrants to the Administrative Class ofthe Diplomatic Service, we should like to see the Service associated in themanagement of the Centre.424. We believe also, that when the manpower position permits, it wouldbe useful, after their short period of initial training, for young officers to be sent for a period of up to about a year to large Embassies. There they would work assupernumeraries, spending perhaps three months in each of the main sections ofthe Embassy.425. There are also introductory courses for all Executive and Clerical classentrants. These should continue and be related as closely as possible to the kinds of work which the officers concerned are likely to be required to do, particularlyin the early stages of their careers.Training for overseas postings426. The greatest single contribution which a training programme can makeis to give effective preparatory training to each officer before he takes up anyappointment abroad. We recommend, therefore, that as a general rule each officerselected for transfer to another post, and officers seconded to the Service, shouldbe placed for a period within the responsibility of the unified Training Department.This Department should equip each officer for his new duties. The period oftraining should be of any length up to about three months. The period would vary according to the qualifications already possessed by the officer and those needed in his new appointment. For example, a junior officer with no previous SouthAmercan experience appointed to an Information post at Caracas or Lima wouldbe given an intensive Spanish course as well as training in information techniques and general briefing about developments in Latin America and British policythere. These periods of &quot; pre-post&quot; training are necessary for all officers but willbe particularly valuable for former Commonwealth and Trade Commission service officers whose experience will have been mainly in English-speaking countries.427. &quot; Pre-post&quot; training is of greatest importance for officers who haverepresentational work to perform; but the aim should be to give some preparatorytraining of this kind to all home-based staff before they go abroad. Part of this&quot;pre-post&quot; training should be made available to wives; we must not forget thepart wives have to play abroad and they must be helped to play it well. Languagetraining in particular should be given to wives, though not on a full-timeresidential basis. There is, however, one anomaly we should like to remove. Thisis that, as a general rule, wives are entitled to fewer language lessons at public expense than their husbands. In future, husbands and wives should be entitled tothe same number of lessons.428. At present, junior officers who have never served abroad before, andtheir wives, are given what is called a &quot; Going Abroad &quot; course. This explainswhat they may expect and what will be expected of them in their overseasappointments. These courses are valuable and should be extended to cover all members of the new Diplomatic Service.
Language Training429. A knowledge of foreign languages will be of fundamental importanceto members of the new Service. The fact that English is nowadays widely spokenmay disguise, but in no way removes, the need for a knowledge of the language of the country where an officer is stationed. Moreover, a knowledge of the more widely used European languages, especially French, will remain a basic andindispensable diplomatic asset. All members of the new Service must be given  an opportunity of acquiring, if they do not already possess it, a good knowledgeof French and at least one other important European language. Over and above this, a suitable number of officers should be specially trained to high standards in &quot; hard &quot; languages, such as Amharic, Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, Japanese,Persian, Polish, Russian, Thai and Turkish. The Foreign Service, it seems to us,has made a much better showing in the field of &quot; hard &quot; languages in the lasttwenty years than it has in ensuring that its members have an adequate knowledgeof French and other European languages. What happened after 1945 was that,faced with an acute staff shortage, those responsible for the administration of theForeign Service decided that they must give priority to the training of officers inthe difficult languages for which full-time study over a long period is essential.Officers posted to countries where European languages are spoken were set towork at once on their full range of normal duties and were expected to acquire the European languages they needed through spare-time study, with assistancefrom public funds for the payment of a limited number of lessons. The result ofthis policy, inevitable as it may have been, has been a falling off in the high standards of European language attainment as compared with pre-war entrants. Officers in overseas appointments are now, in general, too hard-worked to be able to learnlanguages quickly or effectively in their spare time. We think this will continue tobe the case and that the new Service should as a rule teach its members theEuropean languages they need to know on a full-time basis.430. Before 1939, entrants to the Diplomatic or Consular Services were required as a condition of entry to pass an examination in two modern languagesat a standard which could only be attained after many months&apos; residence and full-time study in each of the countries concerned. This requirement was not carried over into the unified Foreign Service after the War because it was held that only those candidates with the financial means of undertaking the necessary period of overseas residence and study would on this basis be able to enter the foreign service. To have maintained the requirement of a high standard of languages atentry would have been to discriminate against candidates who could not afford to undertake language training at their own expense and against candidates whostudied subjects other than Modern Languages at university. It would, of course,greatly reduce the language training problems of the new Diplomatic Service ifthe requirement for a good knowledge of two European languages were to be reintroduced. But we do not think that in all the circumstances it would be rightor possible to do this. It is undoubtedly easier nowadays for young men of moderatemeans to travel abroad. However, we think that one result of requiring candidatesto possess a good knowledge of European languages before entry, as opposed tomerely requiring them to demonstrate a capacity to learn languages, would be totilt the scales heavily in favour of candidates who study Modern Languages as their main subject at university. This would not be acceptable. It would involve cuttingthe new Service off from those who had studied other subjects, such as History,Classics, Economics or Science, which can provide an excellent background training for the public service. The study of modern languages has not shown itself to bethe best academic discipline for members of a diplomatic service. Candidates whohave studied other subjects and acquired the necessary languages in addition oftenturn out better in the end. We do not therefore recommend that an advancedknowledge of French or other European languages should be required as acondition of entry. We do, however, recommend that the linguistic attainments ofeach successful candidate should be studied by the Administration of the service before he takes up his appointment. Individual arrangements should then be madefor those who do not know French and one other European language up to areasonable standard to be given a period of full-time language training to make good these deficiencies. A period of up to six months in total should be set aside for this. For example, an officer might be given a three months&apos; course in Francefollowed, preferably after first posting in London, by a similar three months&apos; course in Germany or Spain. The Administration should also have full discretion, to train
officers in European languages at any convenient time during their careers, noUnecessarily immediately before or during a posting to a country where thoselanguages are spoken.431. There may be a special problem in the unified Diplomatic Servicebecause some of those who come into it from the Commonwealth Relations Officeand the Board of Trade may not have a great command of foreign languages. Thearrangements we have outlined should prove able, over a period of years, to overcome this problem.432. The arrangements for training &quot; hard linguists &quot; in the Foreign service are satisfactory and should be continued. Under present arrangements, the numberof speakers of Arabic and other &quot; hard &quot; languages required is worked out eachyear and the necessary number of officers assigned to full-time study of thoselanguages.433. As a general rule, it is desirable for an officers first posting to be to an appointment in the Foreign Office or Commonwealth Relations Office in London.An exception has been made of those selected for &quot; hard &quot; language training. these officers are as a rule assigned to language study immediately after the introductorycourse. Formal training in a &quot; hard &quot; language has to be followed directly by a first posting in the area where the language is spoken; otherwise the most favourable opportunity is lost of consolidating the language and learning about the people whospeak it and the region where they live. But one result of assigning young officers to hard language courses immediately on joining is that for several years they donot get experience of working at headquarters in London. First-hand experience ofwork in the Foreign or Commonwealth Relations Offices is an essential part oftraining and should not be unduly delayed. We hope, therefore, that the diplomatic service will consider, as an experiment, the alternative course of sending officers to learn &quot; hard &quot; languages after an initial posting in a department in London.434. Languages spoken in the Commonwealth, such as Hindi, should beincluded in the programme for &quot; hard &quot; language training in the combined Service.435. The Foreign Office uses private tutors, commercial language schools andacademic institutions, both in this country and abroad. It does not, as a rule,undertake language training itself. The only exceptions at present are that it employsa teacher of Russian and runs the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies (M.E.C.A.S.)at Shemlan in the Lebanon. Those of us who visited M.E.C.A.S. were impressed by its efficiency and high standards. We have no doubt that M.E.C.A.S. shouldcontinue its work.436. We are content that the new Diplomatic Service should for the momentcontinue to avail itself of existing outside facilities for language training. If, however,the need arises for the new Service to have separate language training facilities either of its own or shared with the Home Civil Service, we hope this need will besympathetically considered. We also hope that the Administration of the diplomatic service will not hesitate to use mechanical aids to language teaching and that any additional money required for this purpose will be made available. The presentsystem of language allowances to encourage officers to learn foreign languages upto an acceptable standard and to maintain it should continue.Functional Training437. At present, officers taking up a specialist &quot; functional &quot; post for the first time are given a course of training in the knowledge and techniques they will require.For example, a consular officer has to be trained for many tasks of a technical and complex nature, including the registration of births and deaths, the performance andregistration of marriages, service of legal documents, taking of evidence, performance of notarial acts, the administration of estates, and specific duties prescribed underthe Merchant Shipping Acts. The Foreign Office therefore runs a consular course which lasts for seven weeks and is followed by a three-month attachment to a busyconsular post in Western Europe. Information courses, now divided into basiccourses for those who have never done information work and refresher courses for those who are already familiar with the work, are run by the Central Office ofInformation. The overseas Departments also train staff in administration work,archives, cypher work and accounts. Courses in commercial work, arranged bv theBoard of Trade, are discussed below.
438. Functional training of this kind is of the highest importance. The present arrangements seem to us sensible and right. There is however not enough specifictraining in administration and management. We should like more attention to begiven to this in future. We also think that some courses could with advantage belonger and more thorough. When the manpower position permits, some coursescould be followed by attachments to posts overseas on a supernumerary basis asis already done with the Foreign Office consular course. No one taking up a consularappointment for the first time should do so without having completed a consularcourse.439. The same is true of first appointments to commercial posts. We havestressed the need for commercial work to be regarded as of first importance in thenew Service. For commercial work training is essential. Commercial officers must,before appointment, have an understanding of the practical problems of theproduction and marketing of exports. Heads of Commercial Sections at postsoverseas must then ensure that this basic knowledge is amplified by propersupervision at the post.440. The Foreign Office and the Board of Trade have recently consideredtraining requirements for commercial staff and have decided that changes are needed in the following main respects.(a) There should be separate courses for different categories of commercialstaff instead of one standard course as at present.(b) More locally-engaged Commercial Officers should be brought home from overseas posts for training courses so that they will have a better understanding of export problems as seen from Britain.(c) Courses for career officers should include a period of concentrated trainingin basic export practice, followed by a period in the export departmentof a large firm where this can be arranged.(d) Industrial tours and visits to firms should not form a major part of basiccommercial training courses but should be arranged as a matter ofroutine for officers in commercial posts when they come to this country on leave. The period spent on duty in this way must not, of course, be counted against their leave.We are glad to know that these changes are being put into effect.Refresher and Mid-Career Training441. Training is not required for the young entrant only. Opportunities shouldbe provided for officers in mid-career to get away from the routine of day-to-daywork and to widen their horizons by thinking about policy problems under lesspressure. The overseas Services already send a few officers to the Imperial DefenceCollege, the Administrative Staff College, the Joint Services Staff College, theN.A.T.O. Defence College and the Canadian National Defence College. The coursesat these colleges stimulate and refresh. Full use should be made of them.442. It is also useful for senior officers who are likely to go on to higherresponsibilities to spend sabbatical years at universities. The Foreign Office havealready sent a small number of officers for a year to the Harvard Center for international Affairs and two have recently been appointed to Fellowships atOxford. More of these attachments should be arranged in future, particularly toenable studies to be undertaken which can be done better by an officer freed fromthe pressure of departmental work.443. We also commend the &quot; Summer Schools&quot; now organised annually bythe Foreign Office at universities. These enable major issues to be examined againstthe background of academic and other outside opinion. The 1963 &quot; SummerSchool&quot;, which was held at Cambridge, was a case in point: at this the subject was &quot; Science, Technology and Foreign Affairs &quot;. The issue is not only of interest initself but directly relevant to the responsibilities of the overseas Services in ascientific age.444. It is probably too early to say whether the Diplomatic Service will ultimately require a Staff College of its own. Such a college would be a majoradministrative and financial undertaking. Because of the present shortage of manpower and the demands on finance for other more immediate purposes, wedo not think it is practicable now. The value of the more dispersed efforts we
Eligibility for training courses446. In principle, all members of all grades and branches are eligible fortraining courses. In practice, the determining factor in selecting officers for trainingmust be what they need in order to be effective in the appointments they will berequired to fill.Training in Britain for Overseas Local Staff447. Locally-engaged staff, principally commercial and information officers,are brought to this country from time to time to attend short courses. There ismerit in this scheme. The Administration of the Diplomatic Service should have discretion to continue it on a somewhat less restricted scale.Cost of Training448. The extra cost of carrying out training programmes on the lines werecommend would, we estimate, be of the order of  50,000 a year, though this figure would only be approached gradually over a period of years. This sumwould not, however, include the cost of the extra manpower needed to enableofficers to be released for training; nor would it include any extra expenses incurred in respect of members of the Diplomatic Service admitted to the centre for Administrative Studies or by the Board of Trade and Central Office ofInformation in respect of commercial and information courses. The cost of theprogramme we propose is modest in relation to the good it can do and werecommend an additional expenditure of this order.recommend should not be underrated. However, a Staff College may becomedesirable when the unified Service has been in existence for some time. Amongthe advantages of such a College would be the independent assessment it would afford of the abilities and promise of members of the Service.445. A number of ad hoc courses are arranged in London. These take insuch subjects as atomic energy and political theory. There will always be a needfor this type of course. The Central Office of Information organise courses andtours in Britain for officers on leave designed to keep them in touch with developments in this country. These ought also to be retained.
CHAPTER SIXCONDITIONS OF SERVICEPrinciples and Aims449. It may be helpful to preface our detailed recommendations on conditions of service with a statement of the main principles which have guidedus. Our underlying purpose throughout has been to devise proposals which will contribute most to morale, efficiency and security and will do so at reasonablecost.450. Since a greater degree of specialisation is needed both functionallyand geographically, we have tried to devise conditions of service which will encourage specialisation and not discourage it. At a number of posts, especially those for which special qualifications are needed, conditions of life are trying ordisagreeable for climatic or political reasons. In recent years the number andproportion of such posts have increased with the spread of the &quot; cold war &quot; andthe emergence of newly independent countries. The effectiveness of british representation overseas depends on the readiness of officers and their families toundertake service at such posts and the degree of enthusiasm with which theyprepare themselves for it. Equally, recruits should not be deterred by unattractiveconditions of service from seeking to join a Service in which such assignmentsare to be expected. The administrators of the unified Service must have at their disposal rules and regulations allowing them to make life as tolerable as possiblein such places.451. We have also had in mind certain objectives of a social character. Aslong ago as 1922 the regulations for the former Diplomatic Service contained thestatement that &quot; no assurance as to the possession of private means will berequired of candidates &quot;. One of the aims of the reforms of 1943 was to create aForeign Service open on merit to recruits &quot; from any social sphere &quot; who wouldbe able to join it with the assurance that they could have a full career without having to rely on private means. In important respects these aims have still notbeen achieved. Men without private means have joined in considerable numberssince 1945. But many, particularly those who have families, have since found themselves in financial difficulties. Our recommendations are designed to rectifythis situation and avert the danger that the field of recruitment will once againbecome too narrow. The overseas Services should be representative of the nation as a whole and not only of the wealthier segments of society.452. Members of the unified Diplomatic Service and their families will inevitably face strain, frustration, upheaval and danger at intervals throughout their careers. Avoidable difficulties caused by faulty administration or failure toprovide reasonable amenities must not be allowed to aggravate matters. the distinctive requirements and needs of those who undertake to spend their careersin a representational service overseas must be recognised and met. There is aparticular need to create conditions which conduce to a normal family life. Anofficer in the Service should be provided with the physical conditions for living and working necessary to counter-balance any disadvantages of his post. Theseconditions should include recreational facilities and leave. He should also be ableto secure for his family as nearly as possible the same advantages and facilities,especially in the matter of education, as those which would be available if he were resident in Britain.453. At the same time, differences in allowances and conditions of service,where these should properly exist between one Service and another and between onegrade and another, must be both justifiable and explicable.454. We have recommended that the existing Foreign and CommonwealthServices and the Trade Commission Service should be reformed into a singleworld-wide Service (para. 44). We have therefore taken as a starting point existing conditions of service in these three, at present separately organised, Services. Wehave had to bear in mind that, whereas the Foreign Service has separate regulations
of its own, members of the Commonwealth Service and of the Trade CommissionService have been regarded as members of the Home Civil Service, though their conditions of service are in many respects similar to those of the Foreign Service.We have also been conscious of the need to maintain provision for government servants from other Departments who undertake tours of duty at Missions abroad.These home-based officers are supported at overseas posts by a further group of employees, British and foreign, engaged locally. Our proposals have therefore been framed to meet the needs of a unified overseas Service composed of permanent members drawn from the present Foreign, Commonwealth and Trade CommissionServices, supported from time to time by officers from other Departments and byother officers engaged and employed on a local basis.455. Throughout we have had careful regard to the probable cost of our recommendations, both direct and in terms of likely repercussions. We do notbelieve that our recommendations should have repercussive effects; they are designed to meet conditions which are special and in our view without parallel inother parts of the public service. Where there has been a choice of equallysatisfactory methods of achieving the changes necessary, we have chosen the more economical. We have tried to make our recommendations particular and specific.In a few cases, we have felt it wise to confine ourselves to identifying the problem and indicating where we think the solution may lie. We have also been guided bythe need to ensure the simplicity and flexibility of administration which will allow the overseas representational services to adapt themselves effectively to a rapidlychanging world.456. Few join the Foreign or Commonwealth Services or will join the unified service because they see them as a safe or comfortable career. Still less will young people join purely as a means of earning a living; there are potentially morelucrative openings elsewhere. The real incentive to join should be a sense of publicservice and of adventure strong enough to outweigh the disadvantages of a life ofperpetual movement and disturbance. It would be unrealistic to expect to be ableto remove all these disadvantages. The special disciplines which apply to an overseascareer in the public service must necessarily be maintained and accepted. But wehave striven to make recommendations which can substantially mitigate the inherent difficulties of the career. Our recommendations, we believe, are fair to thepublic, both as tax-payers and as individuals whose security and well-being stand to be affected by the efficiency, devotion and dependability of its servants overseas.On the basis of such terms of service as we propose, the country can justifiablyexpect to be able to recruit, train and deploy a Diplomatic Service second to none.457. What we recommend is a set of interrelated and carefully balancedproposals. We have done our best to take an objective view of conflicting claims and interests and we have some grounds for believing that our proposals will beregarded by those concerned as an &quot; acceptable package &quot;. The Treasury, forinstance, are particularly interested in the reform of the structure of foreignallowances; the overseas Departments are more concerned with such items asprovision for children&apos;s travel and education. We put forward these proposals asa coherent whole and hope they will be regarded and implemented as such.Foreign Allowances458. The present methods of determining and controlling foreign allowancesat overseas posts are unsatisfactory in several important respects. At present, onesystem of foreign allowances, known as the Foreign Allowance or F.A. system, is applied to members of the Foreign Service. A similar system applies to members ofthe Commonwealth Service and the Trade Commission Service. But anothersystem, known as the Foreign Service Allowance or F.S.A. system, is applied to home Civil Servants serving abroad. This arrangement has led to anomalies andinvidious comparisons, particularly at posts where both Foreign Service Officersand Home Civil Servants are employed. Two officers of the same or equivalentgrade, doing essentially the same type of work in the same place, may under present arrangements be subject to different conditions of service and receivedifferent compensation, for example for the extra cost of living in a foreign country.There may, of course, be sound reasons for distinctions where special circumstancesaffect particular groups of staff overseas. But we are convinced that unnecessarydifferences should be eliminated and that necessary differences should beexplicable.
459. The F.S.A. system is controlled directly by the Treasury. The F.A.system is under the direct supervision of the Foreign Office, though subject tooverall, and in certain aspects detailed, Treasury control. Difficulties andmisunderstandings have arisen over the way the system of control has operated in specific instances. On the one hand, the Foreign Office have complained thatthere have been delays in dealing with recommendations by Foreign ServiceInspectors for adjustments in foreign allowances made necessary by increases inthe cost of living at overseas posts. These delays can cause hardship to overseasofficers and their families. The Treasury, on the other hand, whilst not wishing to check in detail recommendations by Foreign Service Inspectors, have not been ableto accept that Foreign Office proposals should necessarily be approved unamended.The Treasury would, however, like to speed up and simplify the processes ofapproving conditions of service, while retaining control of essentials.460. Our problem was to devise a new system of foreign allowances whichwould(a) be applicable throughout the world to all public servants of comparablegrade;(b) recognise that regular members of the overseas representational servicesrequire in certain respects different conditions of service from home civil Servants to compensate for their nomadic life;(c) enable officers with representational duties to play their part in representingBritain overseas at the appropriate level;(d) be easier to administer, give rise to less delay and provide less cause forfriction, without weakening necessary controls.461. We therefore asked the Departments concerned to co-operate indrawing up a common system of foreign allowances which would(a) produce an allowance, related to the cost of living in a given country orarea, which would be applicable to members of all Departments;(b) leave this basic cost of living allowance, which might be called &quot; LocalAllowance &quot;, under normal Treasury control of pay and conditions ofservice;(c) permit a greater degree of delegated authority for the overseas departments in the field of representational expenditure;(d) achieve a greater degree of simplification in administrative procedures.462. As a result of discussions with Departments, a new system of foreignallowances designed to accord with these principles has been worked out. Thissystem, which we now recommend, envisages that the emoluments of officersserving overseas would be built up in a series of &quot; bands &quot; or &quot; layers &quot; as follows(i) Salary(ii) Local Allowance, including provision for maintenance of children at post(iii) Representational Supplement(iv) Entertainment Allowance(v) Diplomatic Service AllowanceSalary463. At present, members of the Commonwealth Service and of the TradeCommission Service, as Home Civil Servants, receive salaries on normal home civil Service scales. Although the Foreign Service is not part of the Home CivilService, its members receive salaries which correspond, grade for grade, with thoseof Home Civil Servants stationed in central London. Salary is therefore already a common element in the emoluments of all public servants at overseas posts underthe Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office and Board of Trade. Thenew Grades structure which we have recommended (para. 101) for the unified service retains this feature. There will therefore be no difficulty in ensuring thatthe salary &quot; layer &quot; in the emoluments of officers serving at representational postsoverseas remains a common factor, irrespective of the Service from which these officers are drawn.464. There is no inherent reason of principle why members of an overseasrepresentational service should necessarily receive the same salaries as Home Civil
Local Allowance466. This allowance, related to grade and the cost of living in a given country or area, should be applicable alike to members of the new Diplomatic Service andthe Home Civil Service when serving overseas. We propose that the overseas departments and the Treasury should agree on common standards and on a uniform method of computing a Local Allowance. This should be based on theexisting &quot; objective &quot; budget used in assessing the present F.S.A. for Home CivilServants at overseas posts. This &quot; objective &quot; budget is calculated by an Inspectorby reference to the cost of an approved list of requirements varying from post to post but conforming to a general standard everywhere. An advantage of an&quot; objective &quot; budget is that it can be compiled by reference to local prices withoutdirectly troubling the officers concerned for detailed statements of personalexpenditure. The need for these detailed statements is sometimes resented because it can be interpreted as prying into the details of domestic life.467. The new system should begin with a number of joint inspections byInspectors from both the overseas Departments and the Treasury at places wherethere are considerable numbers of members of the overseas Services and of theHome Civil Service, for example the United States and Singapore. These jointinspections will facilitate the establishment and continuance of common standards which should then be applied at all posts. We envisage that the unified Service andthe Treasury will each maintain its own corps of Inspectors but that standards willbe determined and applied at posts irrespective of the Service from which the inspector comes.468. The &quot; objective &quot; budget thus produced would be the basis for theLocal Allowance of a Clerical Officer in the Home Civil Service or an officer ofthe present Grade B6 in the Foreign Service. In some cases there may have to bediffering basic rates where even junior officers of one Service have quite different conditions of life from their colleagues in the other Service, for example if one has accommodation in a Mess or has access to N.A.A.F.I. facilities and&apos;the otherhas not.469. When the required size of the Local Allowance has been calculated as described above for the basic grade of Clerical Officer (present Grade B6), a LocalAllowance would then be calculated in the same way for a Principal or first secretary without representational duties. For officers of other grades, the servants. It could be argued that, as the work of the former is sui generis, itcould appropriately have not only its own grades but its own salaries. There are,however, a number of strong practical arguments which persuade us that it wouldbe wise to retain the link between the salaries of members of the Diplomatic Serviceand those of the Home Civil Service. The first is that its retention makes cross-postings between the two Services easier; these we want to encourage. Second, the link has in practice proved satisfactory and, we think, it is better for the differences in treatment which a career of overseas service requires to be provided in otherways which can be more closely related to specific points of difference. Third,when they are serving at home, members of the overseas representational servicescarry out work which is in many ways comparable to that of Home Civil Servantsworking in London.465. The part which an officers salary plays in his total emoluments overseasis often misunderstood. It is one of the functions of Inspectors to assess the likelyand reasonable total expenditure of each grade of officer serving at each post abroad.This total includes the so-called &quot; A&quot; element for United Kingdom-basedexpenditure. This is identical for all members of the relevant grades and includessuch things as savings and insurance, with a margin for other sterling expenditurenot otherwise provided for. The other elements in the total vary from post to post,and from country to country, according to the local cost of living and other factors.From this estimate of the cost of an officers total requirements, the net mean salary of his grade is subtracted in order to arrive at the amount which must be provided in the form of foreign allowances of one kind or another. In other words, his salary is committed from the start. Although there is a provision for unspecifiedsterling expenditure in the &quot; A &quot; element, the salary as such is not in any sensewholly available to meet unexpected commitments. Either funds for a particularitem of expenditure have to be included somewhere in the total calculation of allowances or they have to be found by reducing other outlays, including savings.
Representational Supplement473. It will be necessary to add to the Local Allowance separate additionalallowances to provide, in appropriate cases, representational expenses. Wetherefore propose that a Representational Supplement, the third &quot; layer &quot;, shouldbe payable to officers who have representational duties to perform, irrespective ofthe Service to which they belong. The Representational Supplement is designedto enable an officer to carry out his representational duties; it is intended to meetthe extra expense of running a home in which official entertainment can be carriedout and of maintaining the equipment needed for that purpose. It does not cover the cost of food and drink; this is included in the Entertainment Allowancementioned below (paras. 476-478). The Representational Supplement should befixed by the Administration of the Diplomatic Service on the advice of itsInspectors, without requiring Treasury approval for individual cases. It will vary according to the post and duties of individuals. The total cost should, of course,be included in the Annual Estimates and the Treasury would discuss it with theDepartment concerned like any other item. It must be recognised that changes inthe amount of Representational Supplements may be called for because of circumstances outside our control, for example local cost-of-living increases. Thefigure in the Annual Estimates will therefore have to include a substantial marginto allow for such inevitable circumstances as well as for broadly foreseeablecontingencies. Special contingencies may none the less still have to be put to theTreasury in the course of any financial year. We believe that these arrangements are more flexible than those in force at present and place control where it properlybelongs.474. It seems likely that, in the initial stages, the Inspectors will be able toarrive at the Representational Supplement only by taking the total of allowanceswhich they have determined on the basis of past practice and experience and thendeducting from that total what is deemed to be the Local Allowance on the basisof the common standards agreed. We readily accept this as a necessary transitionalarrangement. Once the Representational Supplement has been assessed in this way for a particular grade at a particular post it can subsequently be calculated in thenormal way in the light of later changes in costs or requirements. The change-overto the new system should be effected as quickly as possible.475. At an early stage in our work, the Treasury suggested that the root ofthe difficulty they faced in considering representational expenditure lay in thefact that under the present Foreign Office system the &quot; Foreign Allowance &quot; covers^appropriate Local Allowance would be calculated on a proportionate basis,employing the same method as is at present used by the Treasury F.S.A. Inspectors.470. The Local Allowance would be determined by an officers grade andnot by his actual salary point in that grade.471. What we are proposing contains elements from both the Home CivilService F.S.A. and the Foreign Service F.A. systems but would call for changesin both. The terms adopted for allowances under the new system should therefore not be those associated with either of the two systems which it replaces. For thisreason, we should like the name &quot; Local Allowance &quot; to be used for the second&quot; layer &quot;, that is to say the basic addition to salary.472. In considering the make-up of the level of Local Allowance, our attention was drawn to the fact that the present system of foreign allowances for home Civil Servants (F.S.A.) in posts overseas includes provision for themaintenance of one child at the post in the case of all married officers. We havereservations about this, since it involves giving an uncovenanted benefit tocertain categories of officer. We understand, however, that there would be serious financial and administrative problems if this system were not adopted as part ofthe Local Allowance. In the circumstances, therefore, we do not wish to object. Werecommend, however, that provision for second and subsequent children shouldbe made by means of a percentage addition. It was put to us that this should inpractice be calculated as 4% of the total net emoluments, excluding rent, of aClerical Officer (present Grade B6). In the case of representational grades the same percentage would, it was suggested, be applied to the total net emoluments,excluding rent, of an officer in the grade corresponding to the present B4. We acceptboth these proposals.
two quite separate things an element to compensate for extra cost of living andian element to cover the additional costs of representation. They wished to see thesetwo elements separated. The overseas Departments had two main difficulties in agreeing to this. The first was that costs of representation are affected by increases in costs of living in the same way as other local expenditure; this is taken intoaccount in the proposals made above. The second apprehension of the overseas departments was that the separation of representational expediture from other local costs would involve the risk of exposing representational expenditure to aharsher scrutiny than other elements in allowances. We have, however, satisfiedourselves that the Treasury wish to delegate the main responsibility for financial control in the representational field to the overseas Departments themselves andthat a real change of policy is involved. The intention is for the overseas departments, as the proper authorities, to judge the amount necessary for representation and to allocate it between posts and individual officers subject onlyto the usual scrutiny applied by the Treasury to any item in the Estimates.Entertainment Allowance476. As part of the provision for representation, there will also have to bean Entertainment Allowance. This allowance should be subject to the same conditions in respect of financial control as the Representational Supplement but would be regarded as a separate allowance. It would cover the cost of the meals and drinks, as opposed to the cost of maintaining the setting in which they are served and the equipment necessary.477. In 1955, a Select Committee on Estimates criticised the fact thatentertainment allowances were granted to officers serving abroad without any requirement that these should be accountable. In deference to the wishes of theSelect Committee, the Foreign Office introduced a system of accountableentertainment allowances for First Secretaries and below. The system works in thefollowing way. Inspectors assess the number of meal guests and the number ofcocktail guests which officers of a certain grade might be expected to entertaineach year as part of their official duties. The Inspectors also prescribe a standardcost for entertaining each guest. Each officer then submits a list of the guests hehas entertained under each head each quarter. If the list is approved by his senior officers he is then reimbursed at the rate approved by the Inspectors.478. This system seems to us unduly rigid and too detailed. Its effect is oftento prevent entertainment funds from being spent in the most suitable and effective way. It is right that the expenditure of public funds should be accounted for. But,we think, the system now practised goes beyond what the Select Committee hadin mind. We recommend a simplified system of accountability. In place of thepresent system, an officer should in future be required to certify that, in thepreceding quarter, he spent a certain sum in total on the entertainment for officialpurposes of a stated number of guests. The Head of Mission or a senior memberof his staff would certify that the officer had performed his entertainment duties,in the period in question to the satisfaction of the Head of Mission. Heads of mission and Heads of Section would thus continue to concern themselves with thework of their staff in this field and to exercise general guidance. For this purpose,they will be entitled to see lists showing the names of the guests entertained; theselists need not, however, specify the type of entertainment provided. Nor need the lists be preserved for the Inspectors.Diplomatic Service Allowance479. We should have liked to recommend the payment to career membersof the Diplomatic Service of a special allowance to compensate them for havingaccepted an obligation to move as required and at unknown intervals from one country to another, with all the disadvantages and extra expense of having nosettled base. What we had in mind was a &quot; perpetual disturbance &quot; or &quot; peripatetic &quot;allowance payable whether an officer was serving at home or overseas at any given time. We have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the introduction of such an allowance may not be practicable at the present time.480. We recommend, however, that a &quot; Diplomatic Service Allowance&quot;should be payable whenever an officer is serving overseas. The basis for this fourth&quot; layer &quot; of the emoluments of an officer overseas is different from that of the first three. This relates to the &quot; A &quot; element. The &quot; A &quot; element, as we have said, is
Frequency of Inspections482. We recommend that inspections at all overseas posts should take place at least every three years.Application of Foreign Allowances483. It is an essential part of our proposals that an officer should receivethe same foreign allowances in respect of overseas expenditure in the sameappointment irrespective of the Class (Administrative or Executive) to which hebelongs. We hope that the new Grades structure which we recommend (para. 101)will facilitate the application of this principle.Publication of the Composition of Foreign Allowances484. It was represented to us that members of the staff ought to be told insome detail what items their foreign allowances were designed to cover. Wesympathise with this view. On the other hand, we recognise that to provide such information in too great detail would involve an unnecessary amount of administrative work. In the light of these conflicting considerations, we recommendthat the &quot; objective &quot; budget which we propose should form the basis for the LocalAllowance of a Clerical Officer (B6) should be published but that the other&quot; layers &quot; of allowances should be made known in total only.Introduction of new allowance system485. Every effort should be made to introduce the new system of foreignallowances as soon as possible. One means of achieving this might be by thetemporary appointment of additional Inspectors. Another possibility, which wefavour, would be for the Inspectors to make detailed calculations on the basis ofevidence at a few posts and for the new system to be applied at other postswithout an immediate inspectorial visit. In any event, the new system should beintroduced at the beginning of the financial year 1965/6. The new basic LocalAllowance should be introduced for officers in the Diplomatic Service as soon asit is agreed between the overseas Departments and the Treasury. //, thereafter, asa result of negotiations with the Staff Side, the Treasury increases the allowances for other comparable groups, the full new rates should be applied from the same date to members of the overseas Services.

In the rationalisation of foreign allowances we propose the &quot; A &quot;element will disappear entirely. It should be replaced, for career officers only, by anon-taxable Diplomatic Service Allowance calculated and expressed as a fixedpercentage of an officers salary. We recommend that this percentage should befor married officers 15% and for single officers 1\% of the gross mean salary oftheir grade. These figures would need to be reviewed if any of our other main recommendations on conditions of service should not be accepted. This new system would be self-adjusting.Variability of Overseas Allowance481. There must be proper arrangements for modifying the rates of the localallowances in the light of changes in local costs. We recommend that cost of livingindexes, approved by Inspectors, should be kept at every post. When such an indexshows an increase of 10% there should be an immediate adjustment of the local currency element in the allowances. It is also necessary to have a lower &quot; trigger &quot;to provide for a situation in which the cost of living index rises to a level somewhatbelow 10% and remains there for a considerable time. We recommend that, if thecost of living at a post rises by 6% and this increase is maintained for 6 months,there should be a review of the local currency element. The combinedAdministration should also revise or review the local currency elements of theRepresentational and Entertainment Allowances on the same basis.

Reduction of Foreign Allowances when home salaries are increased ortaxation is decreased486. We encountered much dissatisfaction because, under present arrangements, members of the overseas Services serving abroad do not enjoy thefull advantages of increases in salary scales or reductions in taxation. At present,members of the overseas Services abroad retain only one-third of any such benefits.The remaining two-thirds is in effect removed by a corresponding reduction inforeign allowances. We do not consider this just. In future, effective improvements in salaries, whether arising from improvements in salary scales or from income taxconcessions, should be passed on in their entirety to all officers serving overseas.The level of local allowances should, of course, be reviewed at the next inspectionwhen all relevant factors would be taken into account.Frais487. &quot; Frais de representation &quot; is the name given to the allowances of ambassadors and High Commissioners. They are specially calculated in each case.We do not recommend any major change in the system. We consider, however,that the elements at present included in the frais in respect of servants (other thantemporary servants for parties), chauffeurs, gardeners and the upkeep of gardensshould be removed and that these items should be paid direct from public funds.The cost of these items is determined by the nature and size of the residence inwhich the Ambassador or High Commissioner has to live and the staff needed tomaintain it. They are not determined by personal needs or wishes. The cost ofutilities (water, electricity and gas) should continue to be met as part of the frais.Special cases may, however, arise where it is not possible to separate the cost ofutilities for an Ambassador^ living quarters from those of the offices of theMission. Where Social Secretaries are necessary, provision for these should continueto be made through the frais.488. We recommend that retrospective revision of the frais, within a period not exceeding eight months, should be allowed. This would apply in cases wherethe original frais had had to be guessed, either because the post was a new one or because of a genuine change of circumstances in the post. We have in mind, forexample, when a change is made to a new Residence; when a bachelor is succeeded by a married man or vice-versa; or when a post is reopened after a long period of closure.Transfer Grants489. Transfer grants are paid to help meet the costs incurred by an officerwhen he is moved from one post to another. We recommend no change in thegeneral levels of these allowances.490. There is, however, an anomaly which we should like to see removed.At present, an officer whose last appointment before his retirement is at an overseaspost gets no transfer grant on his return home. We recommend that in future such officers should receive a transfer grant at 25 % of the normal rate.Delays in payments of emoluments491. Every effort should be made to improve the methods by whichemoluments are paid. We received strong representations from the Staff Sides thatmethods of payment should be simplified so as to make it unnecessary for balances of salary and allowances to be paid quarterly in arrears as at present. Weunderstand that arrangements, including the possible use of a computer, are beingmade which will help to overcome these difficulties.Provision for children of school age492. Of all the special difficulties which face members of the Foreign and commonwealth Services, that of educating their children and providing for them as normal a home life as possible is by far the greatest. All the evidence we receivedconfirmed and emphasised the fundamental importance of ensuring that membersof the overseas representational services have the means to cope with this problem.
t Local Education costs abroad493. Provision in the Local Allowance covers the cost of maintenance ofchildren living with their parents overseas but not the cost of educating them. Atpresent, the staff of the Commonwealth and Trade Commission Services, but notthe Foreign Service, benefit from a concession by which a contribution is made from public funds to the cost of educating children at posts abroad. We recommendthat members of the Foreign Service and of the proposed unified Service shouldbe given local education costs on the same terms as are now given to Home CivilServants serving overseas.Guardian Allowances494. Occasionally, an officer serving overseas is in a position to arrange forhis children to live with relatives or friends in Britain or to be accommodated ina third country. The allowances per annum granted to such officers are  50 forthe first child,  100 for the second child and  150 for subsequent children. Thehigher rates for second and subsequent children, which are payable only if thechildren are in Britain, were authorised as recently as 1960. The basic rate of  50per annum, however, has not changed since the early post-war period. Werecommend that it should be increased to  75 to enable an officer to make amore substantial contribution towards the cost of the child&apos;s maintenance.Need for boarding school education495. The greatest problem relates to boarding school education. Unlikemost members of the Home Civil Service, members of the Foreign or commonwealth Services are obliged to accept separation from their children forthe greater part of their careers. They cannot normally keep their children of school age with them. Nor can they as a rule send their children to day schools in Britain when they themselves are abroad, even if they might prefer to do so.It is true that at some posts abroad there are schools of an acceptable standard,at least for junior education. But this does not provide the answer to the problemfacing an officer in planning his children&apos;s education. Apart from the fact that thereare many posts where there are no adequate educational facilities, there comes a stage when a child, if he or she is to profit from education and acquire the qualifications necessary for a future career, must enter and remain in someestablished educational system. If this is to be the British system, sooner or latera boarding school education becomes a necessity. This is already recognised bythe provision of boarding school allowances. We consider that the case for continuing to grant such allowances is fully established. There have, however,been recurrent difficulties about the level at which these allowances should be set.At present the allowance is  175 per annum for the first child at boarding school, 300 for the second and  400 for the third and subsequent children. The ForeignOffice and the Commonwealth Relations Office requested that the allowances should be revised so as to provide  370 per annum for the first child,  575 forthe second and  565 for the third.496. Two points stand out about the present rates. The first is that theyfall well short of the actual average cost of keeping children at boarding schoolwhen, in addition to fees, the cost of clothes, equipment, travel and holidaymaintenance is taken into account. As representatives of the staff and of the wivespointed out in evidence, all these costs have risen sharply and are still rising.Second, the allowances are heavily weighted in favour of the later children in a family. It was explained that this was designed to give effect to the principle of&quot; parental sacrifice &quot;. According to this, parents are expected to save from theiremoluments in order to help pay for their children&apos;s education. The rate of allowance for the first child in each family was, we were told, deliberately fixed at a low level ( 175) because it was considered that parents had some latitude fromwhich to provide financial support for the first child. It was recognised that, after making up the deficiency between the education allowance for the first child andthe actual cost of education and maintenance, a parent without private meanswould have little capacity for making financial sacrifices for second and subsequent children. We make no comment on the question of the desirability as a matter ofgeneral principle of requiring parents to make financial sacrifices for the education of their children. But it is clear to us that members of the Foreign and commonwealth Services merit special consideration. The nature of their duties
prevents them, whether they like it or not, from taking full advantage of thesystem of free education in this country. In our view, the extent of the contributionrequired from parents under present arrangements is unrealistically high, especially for the first and second children.497. The question of boarding school allowances has an important bearing on the purpose and concept of the 1943 Reforms by which the Foreign service was intended to be opened to men and women from all walks of life whether ornot they had private means. On our journeys, we talked to a considerable numberof people who had entered the Foreign and Commonwealth Services on the basisof the assurance that private means were not necessary but had since found themselves in great difficulty about paying for the education of their children.This was particularly the case when they had no close relations in this countryable to look after the children during school holidays. We were given detailedaccounts of the private financial position of individual officers. These fully supportthe view that a serious situation exists which must not be allowed to continue.Unless boarding school allowances are substantially improved, there will be a danger that men without private means will be deterred for financial reasons, asthey were before 1943, from seeking to join the overseas representational services.We would deplore anything tending to narrow the field of recruitment to the diplomatic Service. This would be totally at variance with the need to have its members drawn from as broad a section of the community as possible. We have come to the firm conclusion that a radical change in the method of calculationand size of boarding school allowances is essential and urgent.498. We propose that, in future, the allowance in respect of a boy at boardingschool should be the current average fee (at present  365) of the schools represented on the Headmasters&apos; Conference. For girls, the boarding school allowance shouldbe the average boarding fee (at present  344) of all fee-paying schools listed in theGirls&apos; School Year Book, the official annual publication of the Association ofHeadmistresses. These allowances should be adjusted annually, so as to keep themin step with current costs and to avoid the need to renegotiate the basis of the allowance at frequent intervals.499. This proposal, as it stands, would still leave officers to find a substantialsum of money to clothe and equip children at boarding school and to pay for suchextras as holiday maintenance and travel expenses in Britain. This would bearparticularly heavily on those with more than one child. An officer in the Foreignor Commonwealth Services has only limited possibilities for saving. His expenses and his way of life are to a large extent dictated for him. Moreover, his foreignallowances are calculated on the basis that the whole of his salary will first be committed. Some provision for saving is provided, amongst other items, in thepresent &quot; A &quot; element. This provision will continue in the proposed diplomatic service Allowance which ought also to contain some &quot; unallocated margin &quot; toallow some freedom of personal choice. We think it would be reasonable to expectan officer in the Diplomatic Service to bear from these sources the cost, apart fromfees, of maintaining one child at boarding school. For the second and each subsequent child we propose that an additional allowance should be payableamounting to 25% of the average fees, on the basis set out in the preceding paragraph, for boys&apos; and girls&apos; boarding schools together. On current fees, thiswould be  89. For purposes of this additional allowance, no discrimination wouldbe made between boys and girls.500. The present system of Boarding School Allowances makes no distinctionbetween preparatory schools and schools for children of secondary school age.On average, however, preparatory school fees are somewhat lower than upperschool fees. The cost of maintaining a child of preparatory school age is alsosomewhat less. We therefore recommend that the boarding school allowance fora boy or girl at a preparatory school should be 10% less than the allowance for aboy or girl at upper school. The supplement for second and later children atpreparatory schools should also be 10% less than the supplement for second and later children at upper schools (in present terms  89 less 10% or approximately  80).501. We wish to add three important provisos. First, the basic allowance inrespect of boarding school fees should correspond to the average fee and not tothe fees actually charged at any particular school. If a parent wishes and has themeans to send his child to one of the more expensive schools, there is no reason why he should not meet the difference himself. Second, the improvements we
propose must be absolute improvements in financial terms and not balanced by reductions in other allowances. Educational allowances are designed to meetspecific needs and should represent a true increase over and above the emolumentsof officers without children. Third, the effective rate of the allowances should notbe reduced when an officer is transferred to London. At present, boarding schoolallowances are, rightly, tax-free when an officer is serving abroad but becometaxable when he is transferred to London. An officers return to Britain and thelength of his stay is determined by the needs of the Service and not by his ownwishes. It would be unreasonable to expect him to remove his child from boardingschool on his being transferred to London. It would also be unfair to the child.The justification for sending the child to boarding school in the first place was toavoid having to interrupt the educational process. We are therefore strongly of theopinion that the boarding school allowances we have recommended should remaintax free even when the officer is serving at home. Alternatively, if tax is to continueto be levied on them, the rate of allowance must be increased so as to provide thesame amount net after deduction of tax as the officer would have received had hebeen abroad.502. The cost of applying these improvements, apart from the proposed taxconcession, to the Foreign Service, the Commonwealth Service and the TradeCommission Service would be of the order of  185,000 annually. The improvementsrequested by the overseas Services themselves would have cost  228,000 annually.The cost of the changes we propose is modest in relation to the beneficial effects which can confidently be expected to flow from them. Indeed, it is our belief thatthe implementation of these proposals is a prerequisite for the maintenance of theefficiency and morale of the existing representational services and of the unified service we hope will succeed them. If the worry of what is at present an acutefamily and financial problem is removed, officers and their wives will be able to concentrate much more single-mindedly on the challenges and opportunities of theircareer.503. We recognise that there are other public servants who, because of theirobligation for overseas service or their performance of it, receive boarding schoolallowances, though not entirely on the same terms as those at present given to members of the overseas representational services. It would be out of place, as wellas outside our terms of reference, for us to consider whether, or in what respect,our recommendations should also apply to them. We seriously doubt, however,whether any other category of public servant faces problems of the same kind andorder in educating children as does a career member of one of the overseasrepresentational services. His career is governed by a number of factors whichcollectively and cumulatively warrant quite special treatment.504. By far the greater part of a Foreign or Commonwealth Service officerscareer is spent abroad. This normally covers a span of thirty-five years or more inthe course of which he is likely to serve at home for only relatively short periodsat unpredictable intervals. During his career, his children will have to go throug hall the stages of their school education and, in the vast majority of cases, they canonly do this in a boarding school in this country.505. We understand that the Armed Forces have adopted a policy ofproviding service schools in Command Areas throughout the world, therebyensuring continuity in the education of the children of servicemen. Any such arrangement would be wholly impractical and grossly extravagant as a means of meeting the educational needs of about 2,500 children of school age, whose parentsin the Foreign, Commonwealth and Trade Commission Services are scattered in250 posts throughout the world.506. We regard the provision of a fully adequate boarding school allowanceas the key requirement for members of the Foreign and Commonwealth Servicesand the new Diplomatic Service. The problem of boarding school education is inmany ways special to them in its total impact and importance. We strongly recommend that it should be recognised and dealt with as such.507. It is also relevant that the wife of an overseas representational officerplays an important part in the support of her husband&apos;s work. Many of her husband&apos;s representational responsibilities fall as a direct burden on her. These
Concessionary journeys for children509. Before the last war staff serving abroad had to accept that they wouldbe able only on exceptional occasions, or when they themselves had home leave,to see their children whom they had sent to school in this country.510. The time taken by sea voyages normally ruled out any possibility of having children to stay with their parents during the holidays. The introduction ofair travel has changed this. The only obstacle now preventing parents overseasfrom seeing their children during school holidays is the cost of the air fare. this can be a substantial item. At the same time, the problem of finding holidayaccommodation in this country for the children of officers serving overseas hasbecome much more intractable. Grandparents are less able to come to the rescuenowadays than they were in the days when they were able to rely more on domestichelp.511. At present, one annual concessionary journey is provided. Officersserving at distant posts are hardest hit because they cannot afford to pay fares fortheir children to join them during the two school holidays when fares are not met at the public expense. Their more fortunate colleagues who happen to be posted to Paris or Brussels can see their children every holiday at no great financialsacrifice. If we want to encourage officers not only to serve but to specialise insome of the more distant and difficult places it has become urgently necessary toconsider further concessionary journeys.512. The Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office Staff Sidesurged strongly that the cost of fares for children to join their parents should bemet at public expense three times a year. We sympathise with the request but thinkthat in present circumstances it goes too far. We do, however, recommend that thecost of two tourist return fares should be met at public expense in each period of twelve months from the date on which an officer takes up his appointment. Withthe other improvements we are recommending it should be possible, without unduehardship, for most parents to make arrangements for their children to be lookedafter during the third holiday.513. The cost of this improvement is likely to be of the order of  70,000a year. We hope that those concerned will consider to what extent spare seatingcapacity on B.O.A.C. aircraft might be used for these concessionary journeys.514. As a general rule, we should prefer the two free passages to be usedto enable children to fly out to see their parents abroad, since this brings thewhole family together. But we should not wish to rule out the use of theconcessionary journeys to enable a mother to join her children in this country ifthere are special reasons which make this course preferable.515. We wish to emphasise that this proposal and the proposal for improvingboarding school allowances are designed as an integral whole and are centralin our recommendations for the general overhaul of conditions of service. Webelieve that their acceptance and implementation should be regarded as mattersof importance and urgency.require of her much planning and physical and nervous effort, particularly at thoseposts where good servants are in short supply. She expects no financial reward for what she does but she cannot be expected to devote herself wholeheartedly to herofficial duties on behalf of the State if the State, in its turn, does not provide a fully adequate solution to the problem of her children&apos;s education.508. In putting forward our recommendations, we have had to have regardnot only to the educational needs of children of officers serving overseas but alsoto the educational facilities which are available. In the case of children of officersin the overseas representational services, the only practical answer is a boardingschool education in the United Kingdom. Since there is no alternative, we wouldnot accept as valid a criticism which might be levelled that our recommendations were calculated to favour what is sometimes called &quot; the Public School system &quot;.Our concern has been to provide access to the facilities which are available in thiscountry for residential schooling. It is not our wish, nor within our terms ofreference, either to criticise or endorse those facilities in their present form.
516. It was put to us that the responsibilities of parents do not necessarilycome to an end when their children reach the age of 18. The years between the ages of 18 and 21 may call for further, and often substantial, financialcontributions from parents.517. We do not think it reasonable to expect the State to make specialfinancial provision for the further education of the children of officers of the overseas Services after they leave school at the age of 18. Most young people at universities, Technical Colleges or the like go there on scholarships. We see no case for putting children whose parents are in the overseas representationalservices in a specially privileged position. There are, however, three changes which we think should be made in the present arrangements. These are set out below.(a) Concessionary journeys. The representatives of the staff and, in particular,of the wives impressed on us the need to enable parents in the foreign and Commonwealth Services to keep in touch with their childrenbetween the ages of 18 and 21 who are left to continue their education in Britain. We recommend that a free tourist return passage be grantedonce a year for those within this age group who are undergoing afull-time course of education in this country.(b) Modification of Boarding School Allowances. At present a higher rateof boarding school allowance is payable for second and subsequent children than is paid in respect of the first child. When the eldestchild leaves school and goes on to further education at a Universityor Technical College, the second child, who is still at boarding school,ceases to qualify for the boarding school allowance at the higher rate and reverts to the lower rate applicable to the first child. Our own proposals preserve in a somewhat different form the distinctionbetween the assistance to be afforded in respect of first children andin respect of subsequent children. Under our proposals, the grant inrespect of boarding school fees will be the same in all cases but therewill be a grant for other expenses in respect of second and subsequent children only. We do not, however, wish the second child to lose the additional allowance when his elder brother or sister leaves school at the age of 18 and goes on to some form of higher education. Wetherefore recommend that the second and subsequent children shouldcontinue to qualify for the additional allowance when their elderbrothers and sisters go on to further full-time education between the ages of 18 and 21. This is in line with the principle which permits thefull allowance for income tax purposes in respect of university education. We also recommend that a boy or girl should not losehis or her boarding school allowances until the end of the academicyear in which he or she becomes 18.(c) Medical facilities. At present, sons and daughters between the ages of18 and 21 who live with or visit their parents abroad are not entitledto have medical treatment at the public expense. Were the child in britain, he or she would qualify for treatment under the national health Service. We recommend that medical treatment at public expense up to normal National Health Service standards should beprovided for dependent children between the ages of 18 and 21 livingwith or visiting their parents abroad at the time of their illness.The proposals relating to sons and daughters between the ages of 18 and 21are not intended to apply to those who are married.Compassionate Travel518. There is at present no provision for compassionate travel to Britainat public expense if, for example, an officer has to return from his post because a close relative is dying. It is not possible to insure against having to meet the costof a journey in such a contingency if the relative is elderly or in poor health whichis, of course, more often than not the case. The Armed Forces provide forcompassionate travel in the event of the serious illness of a close relation. Thereis no ground for withholding the same concession from members of the unified

The Armed Forces provide forcompassionate travel in the event of the serious illness of a close relation. Thereis no ground for withholding the same concession from members of the unified
Compensation for service at difficult posts520. Members of the overseas services are called upon to serve at a growing number of posts which are &quot; difficult&quot; in one way or another. Some posts haveunhealthy climates; others are isolated and lack normal amenities; at others thepolitical atmosphere is oppressive and there are artificial restrictions on freedomof movement. Posts where these conditions prevail have been &quot; scheduled &quot; underthe terms of Section 42 of the 1949 Superannuation Act. Officers who serve atscheduled posts accumulate pensionable service at a faster rate than officerselsewhere. We encountered some dissatisfaction with the terms of the superannuation Act of 1949 in that it reduces the age at which a man may beretired by three months for each year of scheduled service. We therefore considered whether there were more satisfactory alternative ways of providing rewards for service at difficult posts. It would theoretically be possible, for example, to givecompensation in the form of additional financial emoluments paid at the time ofthe service itself. Such financial compensation could hardly, however, be paid inaddition to the increases in pension afforded by the Superannuation Act of 1949.The Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office were emphatic thatthe 1949 Superannuation Act contained important benefits which their officers would be unwilling to lose.521. We concluded that it would be necessary to devise a further way of encouraging officers to serve, and in some cases to specialise, in regions where living conditions are difficult. The main additional incentive required for service at difficultposts is, we feel sure, the introduction of annual leave in Britain. This is not a novelidea. Annual leave with home passage paid was granted in the former Sudan Serviceand is granted now to staff serving behind the Iron Curtain. The extension of thissystem to all especially difficult posts would be good not only for the morale of theService but for its efficiency. The annual renewal of contact with life in Britain would itself be an advantage. Officers would accumulate less leave in a year&apos;s service thanthey would in a longer period and so would be absent from their posts for shorterperiods at a time. The disruption of work would therefore be less severe, especially if, as we also recommend, leave passages in mid-tour have to be taken by air in both directions. We agree that, if the exigencies of the Service permit, there is a case for continuing to allow officers and their families to travel to or from posts abroadby sea at the beginning and end of their tour of duty at a post. But posts should notbe deprived of officers for protracted periods in mid-tour simply in order to makesea voyages possible. If a sea voyage is taken then, the extra time taken should be counted as leave. We estimate the cost of implementing this proposal for annualleave from particularly difficult posts at about  225,000 a year; this figure includesnot only the cost of travel but the cost of consequentials, such as extra staff.522. The term &quot; unhealthy post&quot; seems to have a disturbing psychological effect on some officers and their families. Posts which we would classify as difficultare not necessarily unhealthy in the strict sense. Though they would include placeswith bad climates, they also cover places with bad political conditions, posts withoutnormal amenities and posts where, as it was put to us, &quot; self-administration is aspecial burden &quot;.Service. We recommend, however, one variation from the privilege granted1to the Armed Forces. We understand that the discretion granted to the armed Forces applies in the case of the serious illness of a man&apos;s childrenor his parents but does not apply in the case of the serious illness of his wife&apos;sparents. We do not consider that in the case of the new Diplomatic Service itwould be right to exclude the possibility of granting a wife a free passage to visitone of her parents who is seriously ill. Both the Foreign Office and the.Commonwealth Relations Office set great store by the role played by wives atposts abroad and would take it amiss if a wife, without an exceptionally good reason, elected not to accompany her husband abroad. The wife is consideredpart of the representational team. We share this view. We therefore believe thatit is necessary to provide travel facilities for the wife in case of compassionateneed to visit either of her parents.519. If the new Service is given discretion to grant compassionate travelwith fares to Britain paid, a great anxiety will be removed. At the same time the concession should cost little; only a few cases warranting the grant ofcompassionate leave journeys will normally arise each year. Except where thereare special reasons to the contrary, compassionate travel should be by touristclass.
Leave524. We consider that the amounts of leave now permitted in Foreign ServiceRegulations will be suitable for the Diplomatic Service. We recommend no generalchanges. Every effort should, however, be made to see that officers are in practiceenabled to take leave due to them, as far as possible when it is due. If proper leaveis not taken, the quality of work suffers. We appreciate, however, that the timing ofleave has to be governed by the exigencies of the public service.525. We recommend that leave from scheduled posts, as described inparagraph 2 of Foreign Service Regulation 20,* should in future be granted to officerseven if they are not returning to a scheduled post after their leave. They should,however, take this leave before starting their next appointment.526. Single women, working full-time in the Foreign Office or commonwealth relations Office, are at present expected, on appointment abroad, to shop and equipthemselves in their spare time if they have no normal leave due to them. This isunrealistic. A girl cannot equip herself in the lunch hour for the major enterprise of moving overseas for a period of years, perhaps to a remote place with widelydifferent standards and needs. Whilst we do not recommend that extra periods of formal leave should be granted for this purpose, we strongly recommend that, asa matter of good management, &quot; time-off &quot; should be granted in reasonable amountsand counted as working time.Qualifying periods for home leave527. At present, the period of qualification for home leave with passage paidvaries considerably according to the category of the post. It is eighteen months oreven one year for all ranks at posts considered special for climatic and other reasons.The normal qualifying period for members of Branch A (except A9 officers) and senior grades of Branch B of the Foreign Service, and their counterparts, is twoyears.528. In principle, it would be desirable to make the period of qualification for home leave with passage paid one year at difficult posts and two years atnormal posts for those grades. This v/ould mean reclassifying as two-year or one-year posts nearly thirty posts in both foreign and Commonwealth countriesat which the period of qualification is at present 18 months. Such a reclassificationwould make for administrative simplicity by reducing the number of &quot; gears &quot; inwhich the new Service would have to be run. But we are persuaded that the postson the eighteen-month list are not at present susceptible of being reclassified fairlyas either two-year or one-year posts. We recommend, however, that, as conditionschange, any suitable opportunities should be taken of reclassifying individualeighteen-month posts in the way we propose.* &quot; Officers who are stationed at certain posts or in certain countries which shall from time totime be specified by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury as unhealthy for purposesof leave of absence . . . . , and who, at the expiration of that leave, return to the same post or anyother of the specified posts, are eligible for additional ordinary leave at the rate of 14 days a year,with a maximum of 28 days.&quot;523. We recommend that the list of &quot; difficult&quot; posts qualifying for annualleave should be reviewed in the spring of each year. As a guide to assessing whichposts should be included in the list, Inspectors should report on conditions at postsunder the following heads:(i) Diseases(ii) Sanitation(iii) Medical facilities(iv) Climate(v) Isolation(vi) Housing(vii) Absence of normal amenities(viii) Civil unrest(ix) Restriction on movement(x) Possibilities for local leave
529. We also recommend that the two-year qualifying period at normal postsshould cover all B4 officers and their counterparts in the Commonwealth Service(Grade 7 in the proposed Diplomatic Service). For other officers we recommendno change.Local Leave530. We recommend no change in the amounts of local leave at presentgranted. However, there is one improvement we should like to see introduced.Unlike other officers, members of grades Cl and C2 of the Foreign Service and corresponding grades in the Commonwealth Service have at present to serve for five years before qualifying for local leave at posts abroad. We consider thisdiscrimination unjust and recommend that it should be removed.Amenities531. There is an annual grant to the Foreign Office and the commonwealth relations Office for the provision at existing posts of amenities such as swimmingpools and tennis courts. In 1963, the total provision for such amenities was  17,500.This sum is seriously inadequate and needs considerable increase. Detailedrequests to the amount of  100,000 have already been submitted for amenitieswhich are known to be needed but which cannot at present be provided for want of funds. No doubt the real backlog is even greater than this. This backlog oughtto be reduced as quickly as possible.532. The amenities provided, particularly at difficult posts, ought to bearcomparison with those provided by good industrial employers. Their scope shouldbe extended to cover, where necessary, amenities like clubs and canteens. A moreup-to-date attitude should be taken towards the provision of amenities such asair-conditioning and deep-freezes.533. The Inspectors should provide in the foreign allowances reasonablesums to enable officers to join suitable local clubs. Inspectors will naturally haveto exercise their discretion. The need for club membership will vary with the postand with the duties of individual officers. At some posts, the primary justificationwill be recreational; at others it will be primarily representational.534. Where climatic or other conditions make it desirable, Inspectors shouldcontinue to include provision in foreign allowances for local leave, for example,in a hill resort or a neighbouring country. They should take into account the costof getting to and from the resort they have in mind.535. Our attention was drawn to a concession made to the TradeCommission Service by which, at posts where air conditioning is necessary inchildren&apos;s bedrooms, a contribution from public funds is made towards running costs. In principle this concession should be extended to the unified Service. But,in order not to extend unduly the number of separate allowances, we suggest that provision for these running costs should be made by the Inspectors as part of thenormal budget provision for electricity.Climatic Clothing536. Officers appointed to certain posts with extreme climates are given an addition to their normal allowances enabling them to buy special climaticclothing. However, the number of occasions in the course of any officers careerwhen this special addition may be paid is at present limited to three. We can see no justification for this. Strong representations were made to us about it on behalfof the staff. The limitation may have constituted rough justice when there werefewer posts in countries with extreme climates. But now many officers have toserve at climatically difficult posts more than three times in the course of theircareers. We recommend that the climatic clothing allowance should normally be payable whenever an officer is appointed to serve at a post where such clothingis necessary. The requalifying period should be not less than three years, exceptin special cases, for example when transfers from a hot climate to a cold climatetake place within that time.
Medical Facilities537. Medical care overseas is provided for members of the overseasrepresentational services as, in effect, an extension of normal National health service facilities. At most posts abroad there is an approved panel of local doctors and dentists who provide a service broadly comparable with National health service standards. At a few posts, however, there is a resident doctor recruitedin Britain on a contract basis by the Foreign and Commonwealth Relations Offices.At the moment there are five doctors, one sister and four nurses serving at postsabroad.538. At home, the Foreign and Commonwealth Services rely for medical advice and assistance on the Treasury Medical Adviser and his staff. The TreasuryMedical Service plays an essential part in maintaining the health and morale and,hence, the viability of the two Services. The help of the Treasury Medical Adviserand his staff is often necessary in ensuring that the medical needs of members ofthe two Services are properly catered for, especially when medical attention in britain is needed at short notice. Their advice is also especially useful and necessary at the stage when appointments are being made.539. Up to the end of 1958 the Commonwealth Relations Office had its ownMedical Board, headed by two doctors with special knowledge of tropical diseases,Its functions have now been taken over by the Treasury Medical Service. TheForeign Service has never had its own medical organisation in London.540. We have considered whether the new Diplomatic Service should havea medical service of its own. The medical and psychological problems of theForeign and Commonwealth Services are in many ways different from those of theHome Civil Service and are harder to deal with because their setting is more complex. The Treasury Medical Service has adapted itself to this by assigning oneof its Senior Medical Officers to take special responsibility for the Foreign Service.The work he has done has been of the greatest value to the well-being and efficiency of the Foreign Service. His appointment has brought to the Serviced medical needsthe benefits of a &quot; family doctor &quot;. The Commonwealth Relations Office told us thatthey would welcome the extension to them of an arrangement of this kind. the senior Medical Officer who has been given special responsibility for looking afterthe Foreign Service has been greatly assisted in his work by being able to call onall the staff and resources of the Treasury Medical Service as a whole. In particular,he has been able to rely on the personal interest and influence of the TreasuryMedical Adviser. The Senior Medical Officer with special responsibility for thenew Diplomatic Service would not be as well placed as he now is to do work forits members if he were cut off from the resources of the Treasury Medical service as a whole. We do not believe that a medical service for the new diplomatic service alone would be large enough to be viable.541. We therefore recommend that the Treasury Medical Service should cater for the needs of the new Diplomatic Service in the same way as it now looks afterthe Foreign Service. It should, however, be frankly recognised that the complexity of the needs of that Service will require a degree of attention disproportionate toits numbers. It may, we think, prove necessary for the Medical Officer who has the primary responsibility for looking after the medical needs of the new Service, andhis colleagues, to devote a larger part of their time to this work.542. We were glad to learn that the Treasury Medical Adviser himself andthe Senior Medical Adviser with special responsibility for the Foreign Service haverecently paid visits to some of the overseas posts where there are special medicalproblems. There should be a regular system of routine medical visits to overseas posts. A doctor from the Treasury Medical Service should also be available to payvisits in cases of special need or emergency. His presence can improve morale.543. Steps are being taken to incorporate the five medical posts nowmaintained at overseas Missions into the career structure of the Treasury medical service. We approve this plan. However, we received requests for the improvementof medical facilities abroad at other posts where local medical facilities are inadequate. We hope that, wherever practicable, the Diplomatic Service will arrange to share medical facilities overseas with Commonwealth and othergovernments, so that the best possible service is provided for the staff at each post.
Consideration should also be given to inaugurating a travelling nurse service,perhaps on a regional basis. Arrangements should also be made to use british service hospitals, wherever possible.544. We recommend that families should always be medically examined bydoctors of the Treasury Medical Service before going out to appointments overseas.Cards giving the medical history of officers and their families should be sent abroad to the country where they have been posted; in this way information about theirhealth will be known to local doctors from the outset. These cards should be kept up to date at all times so as to provide a continuous medical record.Welfare545. We do not as a general rule recommend the appointment at posts abroadof full-time Welfare Officers. Heads of Mission, Heads of Chancery, Heads ofSections and all other officers in positions of authority must feel responsible forthe welfare of their subordinates and their families. At large posts the problem isparticularly acute. Normally the Head of each Section and his wife should beresponsible for the welfare of their staff. It should be clearly laid down at eachpost that the welfare of each officer is the responsibility of a specific member of the senior staff. It is particularly desirable for a woman, preferably a married or olderwoman, to be given the duty at each post of taking special care of the welfare ofthe younger girls.546. There should be a Welfare Section attached to the combinedAdministration of the unified Service. There should always be a senior womanmember of the Section, perhaps a Foreign or Commonwealth Service widow. she should carry out the kind of duties which normally fall to an almoner and should,if possible, have been trained as such.547. Representatives of the Staff Sides said that they would welcome theintroduction of some official arrangements for helping staff to find accommodationon transfer to this country. There is room for a measure of self-help. TheCommonwealth Relations Office Wives&apos; Society and the Foreign Service Wives&apos;Association, both of which are doing excellent work in many other fields, are willing to give help and advice. In addition, the Welfare Section of the unified service should be in a position to give assistance. We do not wish to recommendanything more formal.Accommodation overseas548. During our visits to overseas posts, we received much evidence aboutthe difficulties encountered by members of the staff in obtaining, furnishing and maintaining dwelling accommodation. We were also told of the problems facingthose responsible, both in London and abroad, for official accommodation. Atpresent the Ministry of Public Building and Works is responsible for maintaining and furnishing residences and offices owned by the Crown. The Foreign Officeand the Commonwealth Relations Office are responsible in the same way for accommodation rented by overseas posts (&quot; post hirings &quot;). We recommend, on balance, that this system of divided responsibility should continue. But it requires the closest co-operation at all levels between the Ministry of Public Building and works and the overseas Departments. It also requires from those in Londonsympathetic imagination in visualising and catering for the needs of officers inother countries and in widely differing circumstances. Subject to this, it seemed tous generally preferable for senior staff of the Ministry of Public Building and works and those engaged on the management of government property overseasto be centralised in London rather than grouped in regional offices abroad.549. The first and greatest need is for H.M. Government to own a far higher proportion of the accommodation it uses abroad. This applies both to officialpremises and to premises occupied by members of the staff, but particularly tothe latter. Again and again, far too short a view has been taken when purchaseas opposed to rental has been considered. The tendency everywhere is for propertyvalues to rise steeply. Houses could often have been purchased at the cost of afew years&apos; rent. We came across some glaring examples. Much depends on localconditions but it should be the aim to own at least two-thirds of the residential accommodation required for staff abroad. We recognise that this will involvesubstantial capital expenditure, but this expenditure would be spread over aconsiderable period of years and would represent a major investment.
550. It will not, of course, be possible to acquire by purchase all the flatsand houses needed at a particular post. To this extent, the present system of RentAllowances should continue. By this system an officer, or the post on his behalf,rents accommodation, normally furnished accommodation. The authorised rentalis subject to maxima which are laid down in relation to local costs, an officer&apos;sgrade and his marital status. This, however, is not a system which should be administered too rigidly. An officer with a large family may need a higherallowance than a childless couple. Differences may also be justified where thereis a clear and marked distinction between the extent of the representationalfunctions of two officers of the same grade at the same post. Equally, with rising prices the rule almost everywhere, it may not be possible for a new arrival at a post to rent a suitable house or flat at the rental at which similaraccommodation was obtained by other officers at an earlier date. We came acrossinstances in which officers were paying out of their own pockets the amount bywhich the rental of their accommodation exceeded their rent allowance. We donot quarrel with this if officers deliberately choose to live in a more expensive housethan is strictly necessary. But it is not right to make a man pay this differenceif, after a diligent search, suitable accommodation in a locality appropriate to his appointment cannot be found at the old rate.Maintenance and Furnishing551. We shall not reap the full benefit from a policy of owning a larger proportion of our own residential and official accommodation abroad unless two other changes are made. Better administration and greater financial delegation arerequired. These desiderata are closely connected. Much depends on having well-trained and efficient Administration Officers. Part of their training should becarried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Building and Works. Inthis way close co-operation will be built up.552. A good Administration Officer is also a prerequisite for the secondchange we should like to see a greater use of delegated financial authority. we recognise the need for effective financial control by parent Departments ofexpenditure overseas on their behalf. But this is not incompatible with a greaterdegree of delegated authority to posts, for example for repairs, decoration,equipment, furniture and furnishing. The present levels of delegated authority are conservative and have been too conservatively applied. This has, in our view,caused needless delays, frustration and often unnecessary expense. These could have been avoided if the man in the spot had been allowed a greater degree offinancial responsibility and had been capable of discharging it.553. It also appeared to us that in certain instances the Ministry of public building and Works was out of touch with local conditions and the realrequirements of staff living overseas. There was criticism, much of which we thought justified, of the choice of furniture and furnishings. Sometimes, too littleaccount seemed to have been taken of the needs of varying climatic conditions andlocal customs. Often, this seemed to have resulted from too rigid adherence tosome &quot; rule of thumb &quot;. What seemed sometimes to be lacking was the ability and willingness to recognise and cater for special local needs. It might improvematters if there were some system of regular consultation between the Ministry ofPublic Building and Works and representatives of the wives.554. There may well be cases where local purchase is in all respects themost satisfactory arrangement and any &quot; rule of thumb &quot; which would seem to restrict this possibility should be avoided. Every effort should be made to supplynecessary furniture and furnishings quickly, whether from Britain or by localpurchase. In many cases there are unnecessarily long delays at present; this shouldbe remedied. Again, each post should build up a supply of equipment to suitlocal needs, for example, glass, refrigerators and deep-freezes. These should beavailable at the discretion of the Administration Officer. To the extent that havingsuch equipment on the spot makes it unnecessary for individuals to bring theirown with them, money will be saved. We think that too much public money is spent on transporting basic household equipment from post to post. We do not,however, want in any way to discourage or prevent families from taking withthem to posts abroad those personal belongings and ornaments which do so muchto turn a hired flat or house into a home.
555. We were glad to hear that both the Foreign Office and the commonwealth relations Office are now fully consulted about the design of new buildings abroad.This should continue. The views of those who are to occupy them should always be obtained. There is a close relationship between good working conditions and efficiency.556. The absence of adequate storage space is a marked weakness at manyoverseas posts. Even the most imposing building can be made to look shabbyand unkempt if its doorways and corridors are cluttered by packing-cases andequipment which cannot be stored elsewhere. We encountered far too many instances of this.557. When opportunities present themselves of rebuilding or rehousingconsular posts, consideration should be given to planning them as centres ofBritish influence and not merely as premises in which specific consular functionsare carried out.558. Working conditions in London are far from perfect and there is an urgent need for firm planning for the future housing of the London staff of the unified Service. The building being planned to accommodate the Foreign Officeand the Commonwealth Relations Office in the future should be fully adequate to its purpose. By this we mean three things. First, it must provide accommodationconducive to the efficient despatch of the distinctive tasks of the Foreign and commonwealth Relations Offices. This requirement includes the effective groupingof departments, registries, communications and typing facilities. Second, thebuilding should provide up-to-date working conditions and amenities. Third, andmost important, the building should be capable of accommodating under one roofin central Whitehall all the policy-making sections of the Foreign Office and ofthe Commonwealth Relations Office and the ancillary services on which thesedepend, including the Administration.Home Service Allowances559. The 1943 White Paper (Cmd. 6420) on the Reform of the foreign service said (para. 25):&quot; Foreign Service officers posted to London should not, if they are todo their work properly, be obliged, through lack of means, to cut themselvesoff from contact with foreign representatives or from those wider contactswhich are necessary if they are to be effective representatives of this countrywhen they go abroad again.&quot;560. In consequence, a system of Home Service Allowances was introduced for certain grades of Foreign Service officers serving in Britain. This system was extended, though with variations, to comparable officers in the CommonwealthService.561. The Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office complained that the levels of these allowances were now badly out of date and that repeatedrequests for adjustments to bring them into line with current costs had been rejected.No one disputes that costs have risen substantially since the Home ServiceAllowances were last fixed. The Treasury, however, expressed the view that, inlooking at the measure of assistance now necessary, account should be taken of improvements in total emoluments since then. We cannot agree with this too narrowview. Our opinion is that the measure of additional help required is in need ofrevision. The best way to deal with the problem, however, is not necessarily toincrease the rates of allowances on a simple pro rata basis.Rent and Representation Allowance562. The present allowance, which is taxable, is designed to cover the extra cost incurred by a Foreign Service or Commonwealth Service officer in having tosecure accommodation on a comparatively short-term basis, as compared with thelong-term arrangements which are possible for his colleague in the Home CivilService. It is also designed to ensure that officers in representational grades haveaccommodation suitable for entertainment. In addition, it helps towards maintaining the basic trappings required for entertaining such as linen, glass-ware and crockery.
A- Apart from an increase of  75 per annum for married officers and  25 per annum for single officers in 1949 and an increase for junior married officers in 1955, this allowance has remained unchanged since 1944. To take the Foreign Service asan example, the Rent and Representation Allowance ranges from a minimum of 25 a year to a maximum of  125 a year for single officers in Branches A and B;and from a minimum of  125 a year to a maximum of  285 a year for marriedofficers in the same Branches.563. These allowances are insufficient for officers whose appointments carry with them special representational responsibilities and make it necessary for themto have accommodation in central London where rents are particularly expensive.For other officers in representational grades no change is called for. We recommendthat the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office should have attheir disposal funds from which a &quot; variable rent addition &quot; should be paid toofficers who:(a) hold a post with exceptional representational responsibilities;(b) have to rent accommodation suitable to their grade and representationalresponsibilities within a 10-mile radius, of Whitehall; and(c) otherwise qualify to receive Home Service Allowances. Officers in thepresent grades Al, A2 and A4 and their equivalents should be eligiblefor the &quot; variable rent addition &quot; if they meet these conditions, althoughat present they have no allowance for rent and representation.564. We have discussed with the Departments concerned the principles onwhich the amount of the allowance should be calculated. Broadly speaking, theobject should be to provide these officers with a &quot; variable rent element &quot; calculatedagainst the cost of renting accommodation in central London within an upper anda lower limit. These limits should be reviewed every two or three years. For eachgrade there would be an upper and a lower notional limiting point for rent. Anofficer paying a rental between these two points would receive by way of allowancethe excess over the lower point. An officer paying rent at the higher point or above would receive the maximum reimbursement, that is the difference between thetwo points. The two points should be so fixed as to take into account an officersprobable tax liability in respect of the allowance.Entertainment Allowance565. Officers serving in London in posts carrying representationalresponsibilities receive what is known as the Home Service &quot; EntertainmentAllowance &quot;. The present allowance ranges from  20 per annum for an unmarriedofficer of Grade B4 to  200 for a married officer of Grade A4. No EntertainmentAllowances are at present payable to officers of Grades Al and A2. There is alsoa small entertainment fund, at present  2,300 per annum, available to the ForeignOffice for use, on special occasions, at the discretion of the Permanent Under-Secretary. The allowances for the Commonwealth Relations Office are broadly the same.566. The Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office complained that these allowances had been fixed in 1946 on the basis of costs prevailing in1945 and had not been increased since. Proposals for increasing the allowance had, we were told, been rejected in 1957 and 1962, although in the period between1945 and 1962 there had been an increase in Costs of the order of 80%. TheTreasury did not dispute that costs had increased since 1945 but were unhappyabout the present system. It took no account of the varying functions and needsof individual officers and the costs in aggregate were not inconsiderable,particularly when the separate expenditure of the Government Hospitality fund was added to the bill.567. We invited Departments to explore the possibility of abolishing thepresent system of Home Service Entertainment Allowances and replacing it bymore flexible arrangements. We suggested that these should be such as not onlyto allow for present costs but to ensure that available funds were allocated wheremost required. We made it clear that we did not necessarily wish any increased provision to apply equally to all officers at present drawing Home ServiceAllowances and that provision should be made for officers of the present gradesAl and A2.
568. Departments reported to us that, on this basis, a realistic entertainmentfund for the Foreign Office would be  45,000 at present costs and for theCommonwealth Relations Office  12,800. These figures would have to be adjustedif there were a significant change in the proportions of representational officers inLondon who had served a tour overseas and so were eligible for EntertainmentAllowances. Some similar arrangement would be worked out for the Board ofTrade if necessary.569. We recommend that the present Home Service entertainment provisions should be replaced by departmental entertainment funds on the lines described above. In our view, the Departments themselves should accept responsibility forthe allocation of the new entertainment funds. We suggest, however, that a smallbasic Entertainment Allowance might be made available to all representationalofficers but that a higher rate should apply to those whose appointments entail a specially large amount of entertaining. It may also be advisable to keep a largersum than at present for use at the discretion of the Permanent Under-Secretary.570. These entertainment allowances should be accountable in the same way as we have proposed for entertainment allowances abroad.Other Allowances571. We do not propose any change for career members of the Foreign and commonwealth Services in respect of other fixed allowances and conditions ofservice, for example, car advances, subsistence and travelling allowances andshipboard allowances.Conditions of Service for Seconded Officers572. We propose that seconded officers should have the conditions of serviceand allowances applicable to members of the Diplomatic Service, other than the diplomatic Service Allowance, whilst they are so seconded. Their secondmentshould, however, terminate at the end of their tour of duty with the diplomatic service. Specifically, seconded officers should be eligible, wherever applicable, forthe following conditions of service of members of the Diplomatic Service:Outfit AllowanceClimatic Clothing AllowanceTransfer GrantsLeave, including periods of qualification for fare-paid home leaveBoarding School AllowancesGuardian AllowanceRent AllowanceCar AdvanceSubsistence AllowancesTravelling AllowancesAllowance for Temporary duty in the United Kingdom between overseaspostingsEarned leave allowance in the United Kingdom on transfer from one overseaspost to anotherSick leave allowance in the United Kingdom on transfer from one overseas postto anotherAllowances paid to officers temporarily absent from their overseas stationAccommodation expenses on arrival in the United KingdomShipboard Allowances.573. Language tuition fees, but not language allowances, should be payable to seconded officers on the same terms as to career officers.574. Any distinctions in conditions of service resulting from these arrangements as between those members of the Home Civil Service who go abroadon secondment to the Diplomatic Service and those who go abroad in othercapacities would be justified by reason of the special duties of those for whomsecondment is the right method of appointment.
575. It was put to us that Board of Trade officers who serve overseas onsecondment to the Diplomatic Service should qualify for the &quot; Diplomatic ServiceAllowance &quot;. Those members of the Trade Commission Service who opt to transferpermanently and are accepted will qualify for this allowance in the normal way.This is entirely appropriate because such officers will be liable to serve for thewhole of their careers in an overseas Service. However, the same considerations donot apply to officers seconded from the Board of Trade or other home departments for one or two tours of duty abroad in the course of a normal home civil Service career. Such officers are not undertaking a full career of overseas service and the extension of the Diplomatic Service Allowance to them would undermine the whole basis on which we have sought to rationalise the presentsystems of foreign allowances. We have given the question most carefulconsideration. We are convinced that to extend the Diplomatic Service Allowanceio seconded officers would have the effect of reintroducing and indeed aggravatingmany of the old difficulties and anomalies.576. On the other hand, there are problems facing a Home Civil Servant whois asked, in the course of his career in this country, to undertake a period of dutyabroad. In particular, he is unlikely to have the equipment he will need overseas.We are especially sympathetic to the problem which faces a Home Civil Servantwho is called upon to serve abroad for the first time in a diplomatic post in a relatively senior rank, for example as a Commercial Counsellor. Such an officer is in special need of assistance.577. At present, a Trade Commissioner or Assistant Trade Commissioner on first appointment overseas receives an outfit allowance of  350 if he is marriedor  170 if he is single. Executive and Clerical Officers receive  170 if married or 85 if single. Shorthand typists and typists receive  85. These rates are the same asthose payable to broadly corresponding grades in the Foreign and CommonwealthServices. The problem, as we see it, is to revise these allowances in such a way asto achieve two objectives. The first is to provide a scale of outfit allowance on firstappointment abroad which is related to rank. This would give an increased measureof help to officers, mainly those on secondment, who on first appointment abroadhave to undertake representational duties in a senior capacity. The second objective is to express the outfit allowance in terms which will avoid the need for it to be revised at frequent intervals.578. We propose that outfit allowance on first appointment abroad for adminsitrative and Executive Class Officers (Branches A and B of the presentForeign Service), should be based on the mean point of the salary scale of a principal or A7. A married officer of the Administrative Class should receive a &quot; firstoutfit allowance &quot; of 15% of the mean gross salary of a Principal or A7. On thebasis of present salary rates, this would provide a First Outfit Allowance of  350for a married officer as compared with  340 at present. Single Administrative Classofficers would receive half the married rate. We recommend, however, that officersof Assistant Secretary or Counsellor level and above should receive one and a halftimes the Administrative Class rate (i.e.  350 -f-  175 ^  525 for a married officer and  175 +  87 10s. =  262 10s. for a single officer). Career members of the diplomatic Service would rarely qualify for this specially increased rate for senior officers as they would normally go abroad for the first time in a more juniorcapacity and draw the Outfit Allowance then. The arrangements we propose wouldbe of particular value to Commercial Counsellors and other senior officersseconded from Home Departments.579. We recommend that Executive Class or Branch B officers should normally receive First Outfit Allowances at half the married Administrative Classrate if they are married and at one quarter of that rate if they are single. Membersof the Executive Grades filling representational posts at Second Secretary level or above should, however, be eligible for the allowance at the full administrative class rate if they are being posted abroad for the first time. If they have servedabroad before in a non-representational capacity and have therefore already received a First Outfit Allowance at the Executive Class rate, they should qualify for the difference between the Executive and Administrative Class rates.580. First Outfit Allowances for members of the Secretarial Grades (presentBranch C) should be the same as those for single members of the Executive Grades(present Branch B). The rate of First Outfit Allowance for the Messengerial Grades
(present Branch D) and of the Communications Branch (present Branch T) shouldbe one-third of the married Administrative Class rate for married officers andone-sixth of the married Administrative Class rate for single officers..581. The effect of these changes will be to introduce a system of First OutfitAllowances which, as it will be related to current salaries, will be self-correcting. Itwill involve no substantial change for career members of the Foreign or commonwealth Services, though in most cases their First Outfit Allowance will be slightly higher. The major change will be for those who go abroad for the first time on secondment in a senior representational capacity. This change, together withour recommendation that seconded officers should also be eligible for transferallowances, children&apos;s education allowances and other benefits, will make asubstantial improvement in their conditions of service. In our view, these changes will provide fair and adequate compensation for members of the Board of Tradeand other Departments who volunteer or are selected for tours of duty overseas atdiplomatic posts.Conditions of Service for temporary Staff582. We recommend that those conditions of service of the new diplomatic service which are applied to seconded officers should also apply to temporary UnitedKingdom-based staff.583. We deprecate the practice of employing home-based staff overseas ona temporary basis for periods in excess of about five years. If their services are of continued value, they should be considered for establishment by competition. Onthe other hand, if their services cease to be necessary they should not be retainedout of sympathy, for example because they are not pensionable. By being kept on,some temporary officers have been placed in a false position. There is an undoubtedproblem here but it is not one which can be dealt with in isolation. It is part of the wider question of temporary staff in the public service as a whole.584. We understand that aspects of this wider problem are currently beingconsidered and hope that a satisfactory conclusion will be found.Locally-engaged Staff585. We are seriously concerned about the unsatisfactory conditions of service at present accorded to locally-engaged staff at many posts abroad. The work of overseas posts relies to a great extent on locally-engaged staff, who may or may notbe British nationals. At Foreign Office posts alone there are some 4,500 locally-engaged employees of whom 1,600 are British. The duties these officers carry outare many and varied. They make important contributions in the fields of information,administration and trade promotion and it is hard to see how the work could be sustained without them. Yet, we had an uneasy feeling we do not wish to exaggerate this that some posts have not altogether succeeded in ridding themselves of traces of the once prevalent idea that locally-engaged staff are in some undefinedway inferior to home-based staff. There should be no such antithesis; the meritswould sometimes argue the other way. Home-based and locally-engaged staff eachhave their special uses and their special limitations, but each fulfils an essentialrole. Nowadays, the worth of locally-engaged staff is generally recognised inprinciple. But this is not reflected in their terms of service. For example, for the mostpart they have no pension rights, although they receive gratuities, and little to look forward to in the way of promotion possibilities.586. We fully understand that it would be difficult to grant wide-spreadestablishment to locally-engaged officers. If the work on which a locally-engagedofficer is employed should cease to be required, he might not be suitable for other work at the same post or willing to move to another because of family ties.Establishment would not therefore be a suitable answer. We feel strongly, however,that locally-engaged employees should be paid a salary in no way inferior to ratesbeing paid for similar work by other &quot; good employers &quot; locally. Also, to the extentpracticable, incremental scales for the pay of locally-engaged staff should belengthened and gradings revised so as to offer reasonable prospects of advancementif efficient and loyal service is given. We also recommend with all possible emphasisthat a world-wide contributory superannuation scheme or schemes should beintroduced for all locally-engaged officers as soon as possible, taking into account the practice of &quot; good employers &quot; at the posts concerned. There is already a pension
scheme in operation for locally-engaged staff in North America. The introductionof a world-wide scheme or schemes would not only safeguard the good name ofH.M. Government as an employer overseas but help posts overseas to recruit and hold good men. The lack of a superannuation scheme can lead toinefficiency; there is a natural and human reluctance to dismiss officers after yearsof service if they have accumulated no superannuation rights. The cost with.M. Government of the superannuation scheme for locally-engaged staff of the diplomatic Service can be estimated at  500,000 a year; but, as there would be no need to continue the present arrangements for gratuities once the superannuationscheme was fully in operation, there would be a saving of about  250,000 a year atpresent spent on gratuities.587. By far the greater number of locally-engaged staff overseas are employedby home Departments, more particularly by the Service Departments. We considerit, however, outside our terms of reference to examine whether our recommendationsrelating to superannuation, or Our reasons for making them, apply in greater or lesser degree to the employees of other services. The Treasury has indicated to us that ithas reservations on this point.588. Even if, as we hope, superannuation schemes for locally-engaged staffs,whether British or not, are introduced quickly, there will still be the problemof those for whom such schemes will have come too late to be of real benefit.Whatever the legal position, we do not believe it is possible to employ an officer on a non-pensionable basis for a long period of years without incurring someliability towards him in his old age or towards his dependents in the event ofhis death in harness. A liability of this kind is accepted in certain individual cases but the scale is strictly limited. We now recommend that every effort bemade to give equitable and sympathetic treatment, if need be on an ad hocor ex gratia basis, in cases of hardship arising by reason of the fact thatlocally-engaged staff are not at present pensionable.589. Locally-engaged staff should be eligible for entertainment allowancesor reimbursement of entertainment expenses where their duties warrant it.Retirement590. We appreciate that, for the most part, the present statutory framework of superannuation applies to members both of the overseas and of the homeServices. We confine ourselves, however, to retirement and retirement policy inthe overseas representational services. In our view, our recommendations are fully justified in terms of the special needs and circumstances of these services.Compulsory Premature Retirement591. The Foreign Service Act of 1943 gave the Foreign Secretary authorityto retire, on immediate pension, established officers of the rank of second secretary or above with a minimum of 10 years&apos; service if such retirementwas &quot; desirable in the public interest having regard to his qualifications and theconditions existing in the Service&quot;. Compulsory premature retirement has been used in moderation. Altogether 90 Branch A officers and 18 Branch B officers have been retired under the 1943 Act. These powers have proved a valuableinstrument in the hands of the management. We believe they are reasonable inintent and have been justly used. We therefore recommend that compulsorypremature retirement on the terms specified in the 1943 Act, as amended by theForeign Service Act of 1960, should apply to the Diplomatic Service.592. The extent to which it will be right at any particular time to have recourse to the procedure for premature retirement under the 1943 Act will depend in part, as its wording stipulates, on &quot; the conditions existing in theService&quot; at that time. It must also be recognised that the Diplomatic service will need to retain the services of a number of experienced officers in the middleranks who may not be destined for advancement but who are continuing to dovaluable work. Subject to these two points, it will be in the interests of the combined Service to make use of the provisions for compulsory prematureretirement with reasonable freedom. Officers who are fully useful and needed in their existing ranks but are not clearly fitted for promotion should be passed over but need not necessarily be retired. Those, however, who have already reached ranks in which it has ceased to be in the public interest to retain them

The extent to which it will be right at any particular time to have recourse to the procedure for premature retirement under the 1943 Act will depend in part, as its wording stipulates, on &quot; the conditions existing in theService&quot; at that time. It must also be recognised that the Diplomatic service will need to retain the services of a number of experienced officers in the middleranks who may not be destined for advancement but who are continuing to dovaluable work. Subject to these two points, it will be in the interests of the combined Service to make use of the provisions for compulsory prematureretirement with reasonable freedom. Officers who are fully useful and needed in their existing ranks but are not clearly fitted for promotion should be passed over but need not necessarily be retired. Those, however, who have already reached ranks in which it has ceased to be in the public interest to retain them
should be retired without any stigma as a matter of normal practice. When^practicable, this should be done at an age when it is still possible for them to Wobtain other employment. We are glad to know that in the Foreign service a regular review is made of the position of those officers who have served for aconsiderable period in any one rank without being promoted. These arrangements should continue in the new Service. We were assured that, when it seemed likely that the termination of an officers employment under the 1943 Foreign service act might become necessary, it was normal practice to give him considerableprior warning of this possibility. Prior warning is, in our view, important. Itshould be given, with all relevant particulars, in every case.593. We note that in the Debate in the House of Commons on March 18,1943, there was some pressure for the premature retirement provision of the 1943Act to be made applicable to all officers, irrespective of grade. In the light of experience, the Foreign Office represented to us that the 1943 Act, as amended by the 1960 Act, ought to apply to all established staff who had completed tenyears&apos; service. We cannot accept this argument in full. A valid distinction canbe drawn in this field between the treatment appropriate for senior and junior officers. One of the reasons Why the 1943 Act contained special provisions forpremature retirement on immediate pension of relatively senior officers was thatthe only possible alternative, namely transfer to the Home Civil Service, wasconsidered unrealistic for officers of this level. We accept this. The question iswhere the line should be drawn.594. We have considered whether the level at which the prematureretirement provisions can be applied ought to be lowered. There is agood case for extending them to cover officers of the present Foreign Servicegrade B5 and its equivalent; and, for the sake of completeness, to include thepresent Grade A9 and its equivalent. We recommend this extension.595. For still more junior officers, on the other hand, the alternative of transfer to the Home Civil Service is likely to be feasible in most cases. The1943 Act dealt with the issue of suitability of continued employment in the foreign service only, taking into account the special requirements of that Service. Itwas not legislating for people whose usefulness to the public service as a whole was necessarily at an end. We feel that many officers below the present grades of A9 or B5 can usefully continue their careers in the Home Civil Service evenif they are no longer suited to life in an Overseas Service.596. The question arises whether special conditions will be required foran officer below the present rank of A9 or B5 who is unwilling to accept transfer to the Home Civil Service in spite of the fact that his past service in an overseas department will continue to reckon for the purpose of his eventualsuperannuation. Such an officer cannot reasonably expect to get better termsthan his seniors. Unlike them, he is being offered the chance of alternative employment. A refusal to accept would be a voluntary act on his part and insuch circumstances he could not justly claim more than the preservation untilthe age of 60 of such pension rights as he had already earned. An officer whorefuses transfer cannot, however, be left with no pension rights at all. We cannotignore the fact that existing officers accepted appointment specifically in theForeign Service or the Commonwealth Service and that, in the future, membersof the Diplomatic Service will have competed for or opted to join that Serviceand no other.597. We recommend that, wherever possible, a comparable opening in theHome Civil Service should be offered to officers in grades lower than the presentA9 and B5. An officer who turns down a comparable opening in the Home CivilService and therefore has to be compulsorily retired should not qualify for animmediate pension but should qualify for a deferred pension at the age of 60. Theremay be rare instances in which no comparable Home Civil Service post is available.In such cases retirement on immediate pension is the only fair and realistic solution.598. The modified arrangements we have proposed for officers in gradeslower than the present A9 and B5 should also cover officers in branches equivalentto the present Branches D and T of the Foreign Service and their counterparts inthe Commonwealth Relations Office. We do not, however, think that these provisions for compulsory premature retirement should apply to Branch C or itssuccessor in the unified Service; we make separate recommendations inparagraph 602.
Voluntary Early Retirement599. It was represented to us that the right of the State to retire officersprematurely at its discretion ought to be balanced by a corresponding provisionfor the individual officer to retire voluntarily on pension. We have not been ableto accept the argument that individual officers ought to have the right to retirewhen they choose on an immediate proportionate pension.600. On the other hand, we do not think it right that an officer who retiresvoluntarily after a long period of service should forfeit his pension altogether.We feel strongly that an officer with 20 years&apos; service who retires voluntarily shouldbe allowed on reaching the age of 60 to draw the pension earned up to the timeof his retirement. This would conform with pension practice in the country ingeneral. We think that the government as an employer has fallen behind in notpermitting its employees a privilege which has become more or less standard inother walks of life.Normal Retirement601. With rare exceptions, it has in recent years been the practice to retireail officers within a month or two of their attaining the age of 60. There is, however,no legal compulsion on the Foreign Office or the Commonwealth Relations Officeto retire their officers at this age. In the rigorous conditions which prevail in theForeign Service and the Commonwealth Service the number of people who arestill at the height of their powers beyond the normal age of retirement may notbe large. It is also true that the Service needs relatively young men in many of itssenior posts. Nonetheless, we wish to record our view that useful and experiencedofficers should not be retired automatically on reaching the normal age of retirementif their services are still needed and they themselves are able and willing to carryon. What we propose is that there should be an annual review to determine whichofficers should be offered retention beyond normal retirement age.Voluntary Retirement for established Secretarial Staff602. It was proposed to us that established members of the typing gradeswho no longer wished to serve abroad should be permitted to retire after a certainqualifying period of service with the same gratuity as is given to members of thetyping grades who leave the service in order to marry. We have some sympathy with this proposal. It often happens that an unmarried woman begins after a certainage to find service abroad less attractive; she may in such circumstances become lessversatile and useful. She may have compassionate reasons, for example agingparents, for wanting to leave the Service. On the other hand, there is a shortage oftyping staff in the public service generally. It would be wrong to encourage a typistto leave the public service altogether if other work is available for her in the home civil Service.603. We recommend that an established member of the typing grades whono longer wishes to have liability for service abroad should be offered alternative employment in the Home Civil Service whenever possible. If she accepts a transfer,her past service in an overseas Department would continue to reckon for eventualsuperannuation. If, however, she cannot be offered a post in the Home Civil Service,or if she is offered one and is unable to accept for good compassionate reasons, she should receive the same lump sum as she would have received had she left thepublic service on marriage. We do not consider that compensation should be payable to a member of the typing grades who is offered a job in the Home CivilService, or in any employment to which her pension rights can be transferred, but is unwilling to accept it for reasons which are not of a compassionate nature.Widows&apos; and Orphans&apos; Pension Schemes604. Representatives of the wives and the Staff Side put it to us that the widows&apos; and Orphans&apos; Pension Schemes were inadequate. They asked for these schemes to be improved by the provision of extra allowances to enable a widow,whose husband dies when they are overseas, to continue their children&apos;s education and to set up house in Britain. It was suggested that the widows&apos; pension scheme in the public service was by no means generous in relation to similar schemes setup by large commercial and industrial firms. It is clear to us, however, that it would
not be right to put forward proposals for improving the basic rates in respect ofthe Diplomatic Service without taking into account the rest of the public service.To attempt to evaluate this wider issue would be outside our terms of reference.605. On the narrower issue, however, we take the view that there is a difference between the position of a wife of a Home Civil Servant widowed in britain and that of the wife of an officer in the Diplomatic Service who is widowedabroad. We believe there is a case for helping from public funds the widow of a diplomatic Service officer to continue the education of children who might otherwise have to leave boarding school in the middle of an academic year or before an important examination. The problem of short-term assistance towards a widow&apos;s resettlement in this country merits serious attention. We do not feel able to make precise recommendations but we feel bound to call attention to theproblem and hope that it will be examined sympathetically.Injury Warrants606. The terms of the Injury Warrant are applicable to the public service as a whole. We do not therefore feel competent to make any recommendationabout the adequacy or otherwise of its general provisions. Representations were,however, made to us about the question of compensation for a man who, thoughretained in the Foreign or Commonwealth Service after sustaining an injury, isprevented from undertaking the kind of jobs for which he is qualified or to whichhe might have been promoted but for his injury. We have in mind the kind of casein which, had the injury occurred in this country, the officer might have had an effective claim in law on the ground of reduced earning capacity. We are convincedthat a real problem exists here, though it may affect relatively few people. We hopea way can be found of dealing with it. One possibility in certain cases would beto issue a certificate of liability at the time of an injury, leaving the extent of any financial liability under it to be assessed at a later date.Medical Reject Terms607. During our tours abroad we came upon officers employed on what are known as &quot; medical reject terms &quot;. The phrase is unfortunate. What is involved insuch &quot; permanent unestablished terms &quot; is that an officer does not qualify for apension unless he completes a minimum of twenty years&apos; service or is able at some stage in the intervening twenty years to satisfy the Civil Service Commission thathe has reached the normal standard of medical fitness for full establishment. we recognise the Governmenfs right as an employer to refuse in the first place to engage an officer whose health is suspect. But once the Government has engagedsuch an officer and derived benefit from his service for, say, fifteen years, it hardlyseems right for the Government to disclaim all responsibility in relation to pensionif at that point his health fails. Consideration might be given to the possibility ofproviding such a &quot; permanent unestablished officer &quot; with some compensation, inaddition to the gratuity of between three and twelve months&apos; pay for which he isnow eligible. This compensation should relate to the service he has given, between a minimum of ten years and the point after ten years&apos; service at which, under thepresent rules, he would become eligible for a normal pension.Protection of pension rights against rises in the cost of living608. The Staff Side pressed on us the view that pension rights ought to be protected against rises in the cost of living. Whatever the inherent merits of this request, it is not a matter on which it would be reasonable to ask for action to betaken on behalf of the overseas Services in isolation. The problem is common tothe public service as a whole. We hope, nevertheless, that progress can be made intackling the problem in the wider context in which it clearly has to be considered.Probation609. We recommend that in the Diplomatic Service the system should becontinued by which new recruits to the Foreign and Commonwealth Services arerequired to pass a period of probationary service before their appointments are confirmed. Probationary service is a valuable safeguard and it should not be aformality. A period of three years&apos; probation is recommended for all new staff. An
exception, however, might be made, as at present, for entrants through the supplementary (Over-age) competition; for these the probation period should be two years.Security610. In our investigations we paid special attention to security requirements.During our visits to posts abroad, we made a point of enquiring about the security arrangements in force and in London we took evidence on both physical and personnel security. We have not regarded it as part of our terms of reference tomake detailed recommendations on security procedures which have been thesubject of other investigations. However, we have felt it right to look withparticular care at aspects of security procedures directly related to the establishmentof a unified Diplomatic Service. Earlier in our report (para. 75) we havereommended that there should be a single Security Department rather than as atpresent separate Security Departments in the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices. We now propose that the system of positive vetting, as appliedto all members of the Foreign Service, should be extended to all members of the diplomatic Service.A &quot; Conditions of Service &quot; Code611. Existing regulations will have to be revised in the light of our proposals.When this is being done, the opportunity should be taken of issuing a full set of conditions of service for the Diplomatic Service.
CHAPTER SEVENCONCLUSION .612. Our recommendations are numerous and cover a wide range. But theirextent is not to be taken as implying that we found major deficiencies in the presentoverseas representational services or their personnel. What we are proposingamounts to a measure of rationalisation and adjustment which we believe wouldmake an already efficient sector of the public service more efficient. Some of our recommendations are general; some detailed. All, we believe, are important.613. We set out below our principal conclusions in summary form. We intendthis summary as a guide. It is not to be taken as exhaustive or as a substitute forthe text and detail of our recommendations.(a) Our need for efficient overseas representational services is likely to increase&quot;&quot;  rather tfemore complex and exacting (para. 24). They will need a totaloperational staff of at least the same size as at present (para. 29), plus a margin of 10% (see (i) below). Some bound to their possibleexpansion must, however, be set (para. 30). There will always be scope for changes in direction and emphasis within a scale of activity which,in aggregate, ought not greatly to exceed that at present undertaken(paras. 30-31).(b) The present cost ofthese Services is not unreasonable. There is no way^^&quot;of laying down an optimum cost; much M the expenditure abroad is outside our direct control (para. 36). The highest proportion of theexpenditure is on staffing; major reductions in expenditure could notbe achieved without a comparable reduction in total activity (para. 34).The real test is the efficiency of the Services (para. 36).(c) A unified Service should be created to take in the duties, personnel andposts of the present Foreign Service, Commonwealth service andTrade Commission Service. Separate Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices in Whitehall would be retained (paras. 44-45).id) This unified Service might be known as. &quot; H.M. Diplomatic Service&quot;(para. 51).(e) All members of H.M. Foreign Service should be incorporated in the newDiplomatic Service from a &quot; vesting date &quot; which might be January 1,1965 (paras. 54-55). Members of the Commonwealth Service and ofTrade Commission Service should be given the option either to join the Diplomatic Service as full members or to remain Home CivilServants (paras. 56-58). -   -(/) Secondments between the Diplomatic Service and Home Departments,particularly the Board of Trade, should be encouraged (paras. 59-62).(g) The Dip!omatiG,,Ser,v^ combined^Administration under a&quot; Chief of Administration &quot; (paras?&quot;63-65)7 Joint Promotions boards should be established (paras. 66-70). There should be a singlePersonnel Department, a single Establishment and OrganisationDepartment with its own Organisation and Methods Section, a singleTraining Department and a single Inspectorate. There should also bea single department or departments to arrange conferences and travel and look after buildings and supplies and a single SecurityDepartment (paras. 72-75).. (h) There should be a greater degree of, unification in financial controlprocedures (paras. 78-83).(i) The Diplomatic Service must have flexibility in the control and deploymentV of  manpower.  Without  a  larger  margin  of  manpower,  the! requirements of training, travel, leave and sick leave cannot be met.* A reserve of 10% is suggested (paras. 86-90). . ..
(;&apos;) There should be a new Grades structure for the new Service(paras. 91-104). The new Service should have latitude in varyingcertain staff gradings (paras. 113-116).(k) The existing Foreign Service &quot; marriage bar &quot; regulation for women shouldbe modified in the Diplomatic Service (paras. 117-123).(/) The Diplomatic Service will have serious problems about secretarial assistance unless recruiting improves. A settlement of pay scales andgradings must be regarded as urgent (paras. 130-138).(m) A Messengerial and Chancery Guard Branch should be formed byamalgamating Branch D of the Foreign Service and the SecurityGuards of the Commonwealth Service (para. 151).[n) A unified system of communications is essential. This should be run bymembers of a Communications Branch. Diplomatic Wireless should cover more posts than at present. Certain changes in conditions ofservice for communications staff are called for (paras. 152-167).(o) The need for representation and representational entertainment must berecognised (paras. 169-179).(p) A greater degree of specialisation in languages, areas and functions isrequired within the unified Service (paras. 180-194).(q) The volume and direction of the work undertaken must be carefullycontrolled. A new procedure is required to assess each year whetherthe distribution of effort at posts throughout the world corresponds to needs (paras. 195-207).(r) Although there is a need for functional departments in the Foreign and commonwealth Relations Offices, as much work as possible shouldbe assigned to geographical departments (paras. 211-213).(s) At all Missions overseas, a Head of Chancery should be appointed(paras; 216-218).&apos; v^^^^^^^^^,^^(t) &quot; Policy planning &quot; work should be developed and geared in with policy-making in the overseas Departments and within Whitehall as a whole.There should be close contact with outside experts (paras. 219-234).(u) Economic and commercial work should be regarded as a first charge onthe resources of the Diplomatic Service. There should be a greaterdegree of selectivity in deciding work priorities in this field. Thereshould be greater continuity of staffing at overseas posts and greaterrecognition of the value of locally-engaged Commercial Officers(paras. 235-257).(v) Information work in the Diplomatic Service must be regarded as essentially^as^ah&quot;a^vity designed to further policies and should be undertaken bycareer members of that Service. Members of the presentCommonwealth Relations Office Information Class over the age of fifty on the date of the establishment of the Service should be permitted to spend the rest of their careers on information work only.There is scope for the development of common services in this fieldbetween the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office(paras. 258-280).(w) Cgn^ular-.work.requires reinforcement. Steps should be taken to reducethe pressure of work on consular staffs. In particular, frivolousapplications for repatriation at public expense should be discouragedand consular procedures modernised (paras. 281-294).(x) The need for formal consular facilities in Commonwealth countries mustbe accepted. There should be a closely-knit and co-ordinated chain of command in all non-capital Commonwealth cities where there isBritish representation (paras. 295-300).(y) Work in relation to technical assistance overseas should be regarded asan integral part of the tasks of the Diplomatic Service. The Serviceand its overseas representatives have a major and constructive role to play in helping to determine policy on financial aid (paras. 311-317).(z) The Diplomatic Service should have a unified legal section with a structure of its own and common recruitment (paras. 318-329).

(aa) The Research and Library facilities of the Foreign and commonwealth relations Offices should be integrated (paras. 335-344).(bb) There should be a standard registry and filing system at all posts(paras. 345-351).(cc) Recruiting standards should be maintained but efforts should be redoubledto secure recruits for all grades from a wider range of schools and universities. There should continue to be a system of over-age entry.An even flow of recruitment in all grades is needed for efficiency and morale (paras. 352-383).(dd) There is limited scope for a policy of freer recruitment, above the normalage limits, of men arid women with/experienced Thereis greater scbpefbr borrowing university and other talent for periods of temporary service (paras. 384-388).(ee) With certain exceptions, all civilian officers now attached to overseasMissions should in future serve on secondment (paras. 389-397).Officers from the Armed Forces would continue to serve onattachment. Improvement is needed in the procedure by whichrequirements for Service Attaches or Advisers are assessed(paras. 398-408).(//) Greater expenditure of time, money and effort on training is required andthe Diplomatic Service should have wider discretion in meeting itstraining requirements (paras. 409-412). Arrangements should be madefor the Diplomatic Service to share in the training facilities of theCentre for Administrative Studies (paras. 421-423). &quot;Pre-post&quot;training is of greatest importance: for this purpose officers selected for transfer to another post, and officers seconded to the diplomatic service, should be placed for a period within the responsibility ofthe unified Training Department (para. 426). Language training in european languages should be improved; the arrangements fortraining officers in &quot; hard &quot; languages should be extended to coverlanguages spoken in the Commonwealth (paras. 426-436). Refresherand mid-career training should be continued; a Diplomatic service staff College is not practicable at present (paras. 441-445).(gg) If the Diplomatic Service is to be open to all men and women of merit,whether they have private means or not, there must be a new systemof increased allowances (paras. 449-457).^*^iaia!a^s^(hh) A new&quot;system of Foreign Allowances for the Diplomatic Service should cover (in addition to salary) a Local Allowance, RepresentationalSupplement, Entertainment Allowance and a Diplomatic ServiceAllowance (paras. 458-480). Improved arrangements should beintroduced to take account of changes in living costs overseas(para. 481).in) A new system of boarding school allowances is required. The levels ofthese allowances should be raised substantially (paras. 495-508).(jj) A second annual concessionary journey should be granted for children at school to join their parents overseas during school holidaysI (paras. 509-515).(kk) There should be provision for travel to Britain at public expense oncompassionate grounds (paras. 518-519).(//) Compensation for service at specially difficult posts should take the formof annual home leave (paras. 520-523).(mm) An increase in expenditure on amenities is called for, particularly atdifficult posts (paras. 531-534).(nn) Arrangements governing the frequency at which climatic clothing can beprovided should be made less restrictive (para. 536).(oo) The Treasury Medical Service should cater for the needs of the diplomatic service in the same way as it now looks after the Foreign Service;these needs may require a degree of attention disproportionate to thenumbers involved. All members of an officers family should bemedically examined before appointment overseas (paras. 537-544).
(pp) H.M, Government should own a far higher proportion of the living and working accommodation occupied by members of the diplomatic service overseas (paras. 548-549).(qq) The Ministry of Public Building and Works should be flexible in itsarrangements for maintaining and furnishing accommodationoverseas. Much will depend on well-trained and efficient administration Officers in the Diplomatic Service, especially atoverseas posts (paras. 551-554).(rr) The building to be provided for the Foreign Office and the commonwealth relations Office in the future must be fully adequate to its purpose.There is a close relationship between well-planned working conditions and efficiency (paras. 555-558).(ss) The present system of Home Service Allowances should be overhauled(paras. 559-570).(tt) Seconded officers should have the conditions of service and allowancesapplicable to members of the Diplomatic Service other than the diplomatic Service Allowance (paras. 572-575). Changes should bemade in the present system of First Outfit Allowances especially tohelp those, for example from the Board of Trade, who may go abroadfor the first time on secondment in a senior representational capacity(paras. 576-581).iuu) Conditions of service of locally-engaged staff should be improved. Inparticular, there should be a world-wide contributory superannuationscheme or schemes for locally-engaged officers (paras. 585-589)&apos;.(vv) The system of compulsory premature retirement instituted by the 1943Foreign Service Act should be applied to the new Diplomatic Serviceand extended to cover officers of the present Foreign Servicegrades A9 and B5 and their equivalents (paras. 591-594). Modifiedarrangements should be applied to officers in grades lower than thepresent A9 and B5 and to officers in Branches D and T and theirequivalents (paras. 595-598). Special considerations should applyto established members of the secretarial grades (paras. 602-603).(ww) An officer who retires voluntarily after twenty years&apos; service should be permitted, on reaching the age of 60, to draw the pension earned upto the time of his retirement (paras. 599-600).(xx) There is scope for changes in Widows&apos; and Orphans&apos; Pension Schemes,Injury Warrants and &quot;Permanent Unestablished Terms&quot; (paras.604-605).(yy) Probation in the Diplomatic Service should be on the same lines as inthe present Foreign Service (para. 609).(zz) The system of positive security vetting, as applied to all members of theForeign Service, should be extended to all members of the diplomatic service (para. 610).614.  Estimated Cost of Recommendations(a) Recurrent Cost:We estimate that the annual recurrent costs of applying our proposals to the existing Services or to the new Diplomatic service would be of the order of just under  2 million. Among the mostsizeable items are:Provision and Maintenance of a 10% Margin of;             ^   Manpower (para. 88)        ...      ...      ...  750,000Superannuation for locally-engaged staff (para,586)......      ...   &quot;......      ...  250,000Annual leave from particularly difficult posts(para. 521)    ...      ... :   ......      ...  225,000Improved Boarding School Allowances (paras.495-508);      ...      ...      .........  185,000,     Children&apos;s Journeys (paras. ,509-515) ...      ...  70,000Improved Training (para. 448) ...      ...      ...  50,000Climatic Clothing (para. 536)   ...      ...      ...  40,000
The full financial impact of some of these items would not be felt for some years. It would, for instance, take some time to buildup the proposed margin of manpower and to enlarge the training programme. There should also be economies resulting from themeasures of rationalisation, such as common services, we have proposed.(b) Capital CostOur main proposal for capital expenditure lies in the greatlyenlarged programme which we recommend for the purchase of staffaccommodation overseas (para. 549). This might call for non-recurringexpenditure of  25 or  30 million in all. But such a programme would necessarily be phased over a considerable period of years. It would represent, as we have said, a major investment and in the long runshould provide a saving to the Exchequer which might well be substantial. Our other proposals for capital expenditure might involve an outlay of about  350,000; this would cover amenities at hardshipposts (paras. 531-534) and maintenance and furnishings, for example,air conditioning and food storage equipment (paras. 553-554). this expenditure would also be incurred over a period of years.PLOWDEN (Chairman)a: D.

In 1962 the compulsory English and General papers formed part of the one long written examiniation. In 1963 these papers were used as a qualifying examination to admit candidates to the interview and written examination in academic subjects.The final mark did not include the marks gained in the qualifying examination.
305CONFIDENTIAL 149ANNEX PNote on Civilian Attaches and Advisers(i) We have recommended (paras. 393 and 397) that Civilian Attaches and advisers should, in future, serve on secondment terms and be known by normaldiplomatic ranks, such as Counsellor (Supply) or First Secretary (Civil Aviation).In this Note, however, we refer to them by their present names.Labour Attaches(ii) The first function of a Labour Attache is to keep his Ambassadorinformed about developments in local labour relations and Trades Unionactivities. A second is to inform Departments in Whitehall about overseas labourdevelopments, especially those in which we have something to learn from othercountries. A third duty is to supply information and advice to other countries,for example in helping to formulate new labour codes. A fourth function is to influence the policies of other countries in a way which suits our interests as wellas theirs; for example, we can help newly independent countries to develop trades union, Employers&apos; Organisations and conciliation machinery on well-triedWestern patterns. A fifth duty is to help British visitors interested in the labourand social problems of the country to which Labour Attaches are accredited.(iii) There are at present fourteen Labour Attaches in Missions in foreigncountries. All but four have to cover more than one country each. Some coveras many as eight or nine countries. We do not believe that Labour Attaches caneffectively cover as many countries as this.(iv) Present Labour Attaches have, with one exception, been recruited fromthe departmental or regional staff of the Ministry of Labour. The duties of LabourAttaches are such that they can best be carried out by officials of the Ministryof Labour rather than by members of the Foreign or Commonwealth Services.Their background provides them not only with special knowledge but with an easierentree into the organisations and movements with which they have to maintaintouch. It is, however, essential for a Labour Attache to know the language of thecountry or region to which he is appointed before he takes up his duties; otherwise,too much of the early part of his tour is spent in learning the language. wherever possible, Labour Attaches should stay in an appointment for at least four years.(v) There are four Labour Advisers and two Assistant Advisers in commonwealth countries. There is no sharp distinction between the work of a labour Adviser in the Commonwealth and that of his colleagues in foreigncountries. The kind of help given to developing Commonwealth countries is also given to foreign countries. On the other hand, it is only in foreign countries atpresent that the work of a Labour Attache has an intelligence aspect, for example in countering Communist subversion.(vi) A Labour Attache has to be accepted in government, employer and tradeunion circles. It has been suggested to us that there is sometimes a temptation for labour Attaches or Advisers to sacrifice some of the range of their contacts inorder to be completely accepted in trade union circles. We recognise the difficultybut the temptation should be resisted. Otherwise an Attached view and reports willbe lacking in balance and breadth.I (yii) We were impressed by the value of Labour Attaches and Advisers, notonly in their particular technical field but in relation to political and economic developments generally. We recommend that requests from overseas Missions forthe appointment of such officers should be examined with special sympathy.Scientific Attaches(viii) At present there are twelve Scientific Attaches or Advisers. They are accredited mainly to scientifically advanced countries.(ix) Scientific Attaches have several duties. One is to advise high commissioners and Ambassadors and to report on scientific and technologicaltrends. This task is of increasing importance in an increasingly scientific world.
Another duty is to cultivate wide contacts among scientists in the academic field and in non-governmental organisations. A Scientific Attache has to keepscientific opinion in Britain in touch with scientific and technological developments in the countries within his sphere. He also arranges for visits by scientists.(x) A Scientific Attache can, it was suggested to us, bring in commercialdividends by opening up new fields of contacts, particularly in the academic world.He can, we were told, play a useful role, in close co-operation with commercialstaff, in enhancing opportunities for British exports in the scientific field. we doubt whether it is the right policy to appoint Scientific Attaches with the main object of direct sales promotion. Sales promotion should be the responsibility ofthe Commercial Section of a Mission; any increased effort needed ought to becentred there. Scientific Attaches do, of course, help in this task and should do so;but their role is normally an indirect one.(xi) At present Scientific Attaches are normally selected from theGovernment^ Scientific Staff. On occasion Scientific Attache or Adviser postsmight with advantage be held by eminent scientists from outside the government service. We have in mind scientists who have earned a wide reputation but whosedays of active research are over and who are prepared to undertake a job whichmust involve a substantial amount of administrative work. Such men wouldenhance the influence of their posts.Cultural Attaches(xii) The British Council is responsible for educational and cultural workoverseas, except in so far as this work takes place under the auspices of theCouncil of Europe and UNESCO. In most countries, the British Councilrepresentative works independently of the official British Mission, though hemaintains close contact with it. In some countries, however, it has been foundconvenient for the British Council representative to be formally accredited asCultural Attache. His status should continue to be determined mainly by local circumstances and with due regard to the British Council&apos;s independent status.Civil Air Attaches(xiii) There are Civil Air Attaches at Washington, Paris, Bonn, Rome andBeirut and Civil Aviation Advisers at Melbourne and Singapore. The officers atBeirut, Melbourne and Singapore have regional responsibilities in the Middle East,South Pacific and the Far East respectively. Civil Air Attaches and Advisersmaintain contact with aeronautical authorities, particularly on matters concernedwith mutual concession of rights and provision of facilities for air services. Theyadvise the Head of Mission on all civil aviation matters and keep the Ministry of aviation informed of developments which have a bearing on civil aviation or areof concern to our aircraft industry.Supply Attaches(xiv) The duties of Supply Attaches are to promote the sale of British military equipment abroad.Attaches for Research and Development(xv) These Attaches are the Director General of the Defence Research staffin Washington and his assistants.Agricultural and Food Attaches(xvi) Their functions are to advise Ambassadors and High Commissioners andthe Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. They report on the economic,scientific and technical aspects of agriculture, food production and marketing.Veterinary Officers(xvii) These officers, all stationed in Argentina, represent the Ministry ofAgriculture. Their main duty is to control and inspect meat exports.Petroleum Attache(xviii) An officer is stationed in Washington to act as a link between theMinistry of Power and the oil companies and the United States authorities.
(xix) These officers are stationed in Washington and Singapore. They representBritish shipping interests and keep the Ministry of Transport informed aboutshipping legislation and policy in their areas. They keep contact with the localshipping industry and help the local representatives of British shipowners.Colonial Attaches(xx) At present there is a Colonial Attache in Washington who advises the ambassador on colonial issues. There is also a Colonial Office representative in the Delegation to the United Nations in New York.Financial Staff(xxi) The Economic Minister at H.M. Embassy in Washington is also theUnited Kingdom Executive Director of the International Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund and Head of the United Kingdom Treasury and supply Delegation. He is normally a Treasury official. Three other senior Treasuryofficials are accredited members of the diplomatic staff at Washington. Theydeal with International Bank and Fund questions, general economic and financial matters, establishment questions, procurement and contracts.(xxii) We asked whether the division of duties between the Economic and commercial Ministers in Washington was correct. It was in our mind that theCommercial Minister might be better placed in New York and that it might bepossible for the Economic Minister to become responsible for such of theCommercial Minister^ present duties as had to remain in Washington. However,we were convinced, on investigation, that the two posts must remain in washington with approximately the present division of duties.(xxiii) There are also Treasury officials serving abroad at certain posts otherthan Washington, for example New Delhi and Paris.
