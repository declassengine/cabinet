jfIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER-BRITANNIC MAJESTVSGOVERNMENTTHE EXPANSION AND MODERNISATION OF THE CONSTRUCTION.  industries memorandum by the Minister of Public Building and works at its meeting on 22nd January, 1964, the Economic Policy Committee invited me to report to the Cabinet on the means by which the expansion and modernisation of the construction industries might most effectively be promoted. The Cabinetremitted this question to the Economic Policy Committee on 14th January (CM.(64) 3rd Conclusion, Minute 2(3)).2. In 1963 the construction industries carried out new work to the value ofabout  2,100 million, a figure which was affected by the weather. Demand in 1964is expected to be of the order of  2,500 million and even if the weather is favourablethis will put the construction industries under considerable pressure. This pressure,particularly on building as opposed to civil engineering, is likely to be continuedinto 1965 and perhaps 1966 because of further increases in demand in these years.3. In the longer term it should be possible to bring the situation under controlprovided that from now on we pursue consistently policies which will enable theconstruction industries to expand and modernise.4. The most essential need is to maintain confidence within all sections ofthe construction industries. This means ensuring a steady and continuous flow of orders. As the public sector accounts for over half of all work any measures to restrict investment to meet the demand we have deliberately generated would be disastrous. The pressure that now exists is in fact the pre-condition of bringing about the changes which are essential in the construction industries.5. Any adjustment that has to be made if output does not rise fast enoughmust take the form of a moderation of the rate of increase of public sector demand and not a cut-back of approved programmes or projects which have been set inhand. Moreover any measures affecting the construction industries must haveregard to regional as well as to national considerations and to each class of buildingoperations.6. If pressure on resources is not met by increased productivity and leads to rising costs then the Government, like any other customer, will be entitled toreduce its programme to keep within its financial budget. I have publicly warned the construction industries that if their costs rise faster than their productivitythey cannot expect to be able automatically to make the customers pay for suchan increase.7. In my view we should take all necessary measures to achieve the followingobjectives:(i) The Spread of Labour-saving MethodsGood progress is now being made with the development of LocalAuthority consortia for both school building and housing. This will be supplemented by the National Building Agency which will serve both thepublic and the private sectors. The collation of orders into large programmesPrinted for the Cabinet.

confidential^will encourage the spread ^of,. modern methods of traditional and nop^ traditional building which will permit standardisation of components anWsave site labour. . \s a?&apos;We should how consider whether we ought to provide some furtherstimulus through our control of public sector building. We could offer some financial inducements to public bodies willing to use industrialised methods.This is open to the objection that it creates a new and unnecessary&apos;subsidy for the builders and for the many public authorities who are already showingincreasing willingness to use labour-saving methods. Alternatively we couldallow approved programmes to be increased if they conform to an approvedrate of site man hours per building. A third possibility, which I think offers the best prospects of success, is to withhold approval for any project involving a high content of site labour unless &quot;it&apos;can be justified in the particular circumstances.(ii) The Introduction, of a National.Building Code , ,   -    :,   , ,;The variety, in content and standard, of enforcement, of local authoritybye-laws is a serious obstacle to &quot;the efficient design and construction of buildings and to the introduction of new materials .and methods. A.centralcode of regulations to replace existing provisions is&apos;being prepared by the,Mini,stry of Housing and Local Government and the Ministry of public building and Works. The process is almost complete and I hope to make thenecessary regulations later this year. I think we must go further and introduce a Building Code Bill empowering me to introduce further improvements. i will shortly be bringing forward proposals for legislation in the 1964-65Session.(u\) The Improvement of Management:.. The quality of management in many construction firms is poor and not enough is being done to improve it. In direct Government building we are giving a practical stimulus to modern management techniques by specifying-their use in large contracts. I am also exploring the possibility of increasingformal training in management either by setting up a new College of BuildingManagement or by extending existing facilities provided through the Ministryof: Education. In addition we are- organising courses and lectures in management up and down the country: I intend to expand this effort as fast as possible to cover every section of the construction industries.(iv) The Intensification of Training and Retraining of Skilled CraftsmenOur present plans are based on the assumption that it will not be possibleto increase substantially the total labour force and that we must thereforeincrease both the proportion of skilled men and the output per skilled man.&quot;With the progress of technological redundancy more men may become available. It is therefore vital to give all possible support to the Minister ofLabour&apos;s plans for training centres and for an Industrial Training Board forthe construction industries. -(v) The Adaptation of Contract ProceduresSome of the contract procedures currently in use are not conducive toefficient large scale operations. The Banwell Committee which I set up toconsider the placing and management of building and, civil engineeringcontracts have already, in their interim report, recommended the wider use of selective tendering. I expect their final report shortly. Whatever their conclusions, I believe we shall have to promote the wider use of such methodsas negotiated and serial tendering. This would create the most favourable conditions for the national and more progressive contractors and encourage them to associate smaller local contractors with their operations in the most efficient way- -(vi) The Development of Research and Information ServicesResearch in the construction industries is inadequate and the dissemination of information haphazard. The building industry have responded very half-heartedly to our proposals for a jointly financed Research and InformationAssociation. A Working Party set up with the industry&apos;s approval has justrecommended the imposition of a compulsory levy to raise the very substantial
*: sums which it considers necessary and the possibility of a Development Council,: i:to administer these sums. My preliminary discussions with the representative organisations have shown a considerable measure of support in principle for. such a Development Council. I will be bringing this matter before the economic policy Committee at an early date. ,(vii) The Reduction of Bad-weather DelaysA great deal of output is lost in the building industry through delays andStoppages duririglbad weather. The winter of 1962-63, when we lost perhaps 170 million worth of work, illustrates this very forcibly. I have published a technical survey of the known ways in which these losses can be reduced. Ihave also appointed a Winter Building Adviser, with a representative standingcommittee, to pursue the matter. Even in a good winter there is much potentialoutput to secure. In the national interest I suggest we should be prepared toprovide in contracts for public building that work should continue in all butthe most extreme conditions.8. If my colleagues agree to action on the lines set out above, then I believewe will steadily increase the capacity of the construction industries to meet thegreater demands that will inevitably fall upon them. In the shorter term I am sure we must not reduce any programme or cut any project to which we arepublicly committed. The only case in which we could do this without being accused of destroying confidence is if the construction industries&apos; costs rose much faster than their productivity. However, until we can see our way more clearly, it wouldbe prudent to be prepared to adjust forward programmes of public service investment in so far as this is compatible with our declared commitments. Thiswould leave some room for manoeuvre for any specific proposals which for reasons of policy have to be brought forward in the meantime.G. R.Ministry of Public Building and Works, S.E. 1,29th January, 1964.
