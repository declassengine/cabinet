Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1964 &apos;CP. (64) 46 Copy No.   6114th February, 1964CABINETSHORT BROS. &amp; HARLAND AND THE SKYVAN aircraft memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general  doubt very much whether we should spend  1-6 million, as the Ministerof Aviation proposes, on the development and initial production of the Skyvan.2. As regards the commercial prospects of this aircraft, I think that theMinister^ comment that there is a risk that sales will not enable the firm to breakeven understates the position. But in any event I judge that the case for assisting the Skyvan rests less upon its commercial merits than upon the effect thatGovernment assistance for this aircraft would have on the morale of the designteam at Shorts.3. The Minister says that it is unlikely that there is a long-term future forShorts as aircraft designers. The position is, therefore, that Shorts cannot bemaintained as a balanced unit, designing and producing aircraft and guided weapons on its own, and that the future of the Company must be planned on this basis. The Minister^ proposal seems to me to be in direct conflict with this objective, since it will result in new design effort being started up. Once the Skyvangets under way, I do not doubt that we shall be pressed to agree to further projects in order to prevent the dissolution of the Skyvan team, in the same way that weare now being asked to agree to support the Skyvan in order to prevent the dissolution of the Belfast team. I expect it will also be argued that the salesprospects of the Skyvan will be seriously damaged if there is no design team tosupport it. In this way the design team would be kept going indefinitely, by usingpublic money to support the continuation of unwanted aircraft.4. The Minister of Aviation suggests that approval of the Skyvan will slowdown the erosion of the Shorts design team. I am not myself necessarily convincedthat, without the Skyvan, the design team will face an immediate crisis, since I am not sure that the Shorts designers will so easily find other jobs to go to. But I take it that the Ministers objective is to convince those who are now working on theSeacat and Belfast that there is sufficient of a future for the Shorts design teamto warrant their staying on with the Company. It seems to me unlikely that support for the Skyvan will change their assessment of the future of Shorts. If, however,as the Minister of Aviation says, there is no long-term future for the Shorts designteam, I doubt if it is wise to try to lead the designers to suppose the contrary.5. I do not know whether the Minister is suggesting that, if the Skyvan is approved, Shorts will be able to keep enough designers to complete the Belfast andSeacat. At an earlier stage I understood his view to be that even if the Skyvan wentahead, it would still be necessary to make special arrangements, probably with oneof the major aircraft groups, for continuing design support for the Belfast.6. As regards production, the number of new jobs created would only reach the figure of 500-800 if Shorts build 25-30 aircraft a year. This in turn assumesIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Treasury Chambers, S.W. /.14th February, 1964.that they will sell no less than about 150 aircraft in all an assumption that appegjito me to be very over-optimistic, in view of the fact that it is not even claimed thatthere is any domestic market for this aircraft and no certainty of any foreign sale.It is worth noting moreover that some 40 per cent of the production cost of theaircraft is attributable to the French-built Astazou engines which would, of course,involve support for the French aircraft industry and be at the cost of our balanceof payments.7. My view remains therefore that it would be a wrong use of public moneyto support the construction of this aircraft.J. A. B.-C.
