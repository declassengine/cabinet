^ confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1964CP. (64) 43 Copy No.   6212th February, 1964CABINETPENSION RIGHTS OF DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONSMemorandum by the Attorney-GeneralThe present Director of Public Prosecutions is due to retire shortly and the pension rights attaching to his office are highly relevant to the choice of his successor. This is a matter on which I have been unable to reach agreement withthe Home Secretary and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, both when the matter was considered by the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (63) 12th Meeting, Minute 3,and H.P. (63) 4th Meeting, Minute 1) and in the course of subsequent discussion.I accordingly have no alternative but to bring it to the attention of the Cabinet.2. The Director is appointed by the Home Secretary but works under mysuperintendence and is subject to my directions. The post is one of very greatimportance in the administration of the criminal law, particularly at the presenttime. It is essential that the Director, who is required by statute to be a barrister orsolicitor of 10 years&apos; standing, should be someone who is well known to andrespected by the Judges of the Queen&apos;s Bench Division and the Bar. He must notonly have an extensive knowledge of the criminal law, but must be a goodadministrator with a gift for distinguishing the type of case which is likely to cause trouble. The present Director was unique in certain respects since on appointmenthe was serving in the Home Office as head of &quot; C &quot; Division having previously beenboth a barrister and a successful solicitor. Each of his three immediate predecessorswas senior Treasury counsel at the Central Criminal Court before his appointment.The importance of the office to-day is certainly as great as ever, probably greaterwith the present heavy incidence of crime. It is essential that the terms andconditions of the appointment should attract men of very high standing. It is a postwhich calls for the constant exercise of completely independent judgment and anespecial characteristic of shrewdness in the early recognition of political contentin the decisions which the Director has to take. The ill consequences to any government and to the country by the appointment to this post of an inadequateman who is either too rigid or too pliable are obvious. Moreover, it needs a man withwide contemporary experience of the practice and procedure of the criminal lawand the calibre of man required would fall little short of that of a High Court Judge.Indeed there might be men suitable for the High Court Bench who would prefer thework of the Director to that of the Bench and would be content with the lessersalary ( 8,000 for the High Court Judge,  6,750 for the Director of public prosecutions), provided the pension terms were sufficient. It is in the markeddifference of terms of pension (with the High Court Judge after 15 years receivinghalf salary, namely,  4,000, while the Director appointed from outside the CivilService after 15 years&apos; service would receive only  2,025), which will surely detersuitable candidates and which jeopardises the chances of securing the services ofthe appropriate person to fill this extremely important post.3. The superannuation rights attaching to the office of Director of public prosecutions are at present the same as those of civil servants and are subject to the superannuation Acts. Under these Acts the Treasury may authorise the grant to aperson appointed with special qualifications from outside the Civil Service of&quot; added years &quot; sufficient to enable him to count each year of actual service as3918
Law Officers&apos; Department,10th February, 1964.eight-fifths of a year for pension purposes. The Home Secretary and the ChiPSecretary to the Treasury argue that this enables pension terms to be providedwhich will be sufficiently favourable to attract candidates of the right calibre.4. It is evident from what I have said above that it is highly unlikely that anyone would be appointed Director before the age of 50 and he would normally be expected to retire on reaching 65, so that it is reasonable to suppose that he willhave no more than 15 years in office and perhaps only 10. With the Directorspresent salary of  6,750 a year, and with a pension of  2,025 if appointed from outside the Civil Service after 15 years&apos; service, the post contrasts most unfavourablyeven with the position of a county court judge, whose salary is  5,300 a year witha pension of  2,650 a year after 15 years&apos; service but who is able to continue in office until the age of 72; and with that of the Judge Advocate General who has a salary of  5,600 a year and is entitled to a pension of  2,800 a year after 15 years&apos;service and does not have to retire until the age of 70. Between 65 and 70 theprospect involves the contrast between a low pension and a good salary for theperiod.5. I have no doubt whatever that the pension terms available to the Directorunder the Superannuation Acts are simply not good enough to attract candidatesof the calibre whom I regard as essential for this key post. This has indeed been recognised by the Treasury who, in an endeavour to meet my views, have offered(as an alternative to a pension under the Superannuation Acts) to pay the cost of keeping up any insurance policy which someone appointed from outside theCivil Service might have taken out to provide for his retirement in reliance on theprovisions of the Finance Act 1956. This enables an amount up to one-tenth of thenet earnings of the person concerned (up to a figure of  750) to count for tax relief and the Treasury have accordingly suggested that they should pay an amount equalto 10 per cent of the Director&apos;s salary towards keeping up the premiums on an insurance policy. This would provide for an annuity of approximately  2,500 ayear on retirement if the person concerned could be supposed to have made provision in the late 1950s for his retirement on reaching 65 in the late 1970s. Butthis assumes that a candidate for appointment had in fact made such arrangements.I regard this as highly unlikely since any good candidate would have strongexpectations of going on the Bench and may well have decided in consequence notto provide for his retirement in this way. In any case I do not regard a pension of 2,500 as good enough.6. In my view the Director is entitled to pension terms only slightly less favourable than those of a High Court Judge or perhaps of an Official Referee ofthe Supreme Court who have pension terms which provide for a maximum pension of one-half the salary after 15 years&apos; service. I recommend that the Director shouldhave a pension after 15 years of  3,375 if he is recruited from outside the CivilService.7. It is argued that the Treasury would be caused considerable embarrassmentif special pension terms were provided by statute for the Director in order to attracta candidate of the necessary quality, because it is said that the same consideration would apply to other Civil Service posts for which the Government might wish to recruit from outside. I do not think that this argument should be allowed to prevailif, as I consider is plainly the case, it is not possible to find the right person for thepost of Director on the existing pension terms or any other terms which theTreasury is so far prepared to offer.8. I therefore ask the Cabinet to agree that the pension terms of the Directorof Public Prosecutions should in future be on the basis of a maximum pension of half the current salary after 15 years of service.J.
