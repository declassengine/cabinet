Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1964CP. (64) 25 Copy No. 6428th January, 1964CABINETLEGISLATION ON THE LIABILITY OF OPERATORS of nuclear-FUELLED shipd memorandum by the Minister of transport to help resolve the difficulty over the reception of American nuclear-propelledwarships in this country, it has been suggested that legislation should be introduced in the current session to impose sole and absolute liability on the operators of nuclear-propelled ships in the event of an accident.2. I do not think the time is ripe for such legislation. There is every advantage in waiting until we and other nations are nearer having nuclearmerchant ships. I am not at all sure that establishing the principle of absolute liability would be in our interests. The normal procedure in matters of this kind is to wait until there is a fair consensus of opinion among the countries concerned.If we act unilaterally now we are liable to handicap ourselves. For example, weshould be placing the British operator of a nuclear ship (which means in practice the British tax-payer, since the Government would have to carry the risk on the operators behalf) in a position when he was always liable but foreign operatorswould not be liable except when within British jurisdiction. Other countries may apply different rules for or limits on the liability of nuclear ship operators. Wedo not know. All we know about the 1962 Convention is that the only countriesbesides ourselves with nuclear-fuelled ships, the United States and the USSR, haveno intention of ratifying it.3. So far as merchant ships are concerned therefore and I must emphasise that the nuclear merchant ship may in time come to be of great economic importance to us there have been cogent reasons for biding our time; and no positive reason for early legislation. (There are no nuclear merchant ships afloat the Savannah is a sea-going propaganda exhibit and the Lenin an ice-breaker.And we know of no nuclear ships at present building except warships.)4. These reasons still apply. We may do grave harm to our shipping and ourshipyards if we do not wait until we can discuss the question of liabilityinternationally in an atmosphere in which several countries, as well as ourselves,are seriously interested in operating and selling such ships.5. It seems a roundabout solution to the problem of imposing liability on american warships to impose on our own nuclear merchant ships (before we have any) a liability neither the American nor any other Government is imposing ontheirs. Moreover I understand that even after legislation diplomatic exchanges withthe Americans would still be necessary to cover damage to property. This damage is at least as likely as damage to persons. Would it not be best to cover the whole matter diplomatically?6. Finally, how do we explain it to Parliament, if we have to legislate now?Pressure on Government time has prevented me, for example, from introducing aGovernment Bill to enable us to ratify the 1960 Convention on Safety of Life at3835[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1,28th January, 1964.Sea. (The Bill now belatedly before Parliament is a Private Member&apos;s.) We should need to explain that the need to rush through a Bill on liability arose from suddentrouble over Holy Loch. If the Bill is indispensable now, it implies that the position has been unsatisfactory (despite Government assurances to the contrary) ever sincethe Americans arrived and will remain so until the Bill is passed. Do the Americansreally want to force us to stir up intense controversy about Holy Loch at this juncture?E. M.
