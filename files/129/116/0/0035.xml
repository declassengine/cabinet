Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1964CP. (64) 35 Copy No.  614th February, 1964CABINETSALARIES OF THE HIGHER judiciary memorandum by the Lord chancellor the paper circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the salaries of the Chairmen and Members of Boards of Nationalised Industries (CP. (64) 27)makes it essential for me to bring to the notice of the Cabinet the problem ofthe Salaries of the Higher Judiciary.2. I am satisfied that if the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals forthe nationalised industries are adopted and announced there will be a strongreaction from the Judges. Last October I received a letter from the Lord chief justice expressing his considered and emphatic view that the time for an increasein their salaries was long overdue. I fully agreed with him. The Judges have had no increase since 1954: that was their first increase for 120 years. On the other handI see that the salaries of the Chairmen and Members of the Boards of nationalised industries were last raised in 1957.3. When the Cabinet recently decided to adopt the recommendations of the franks Committee on the Pay of the Higher Civil Service, I pointed out that thedecision would have important repercussions on the Higher Judiciary. I called attention to the position again in the course of the discussion on the pay ofMembers of Parliament and Ministers CM. (63) 9th Conclusions, Minute 4.4. The Annex shows the present salaries of the Higher Judiciary in England,Scotland and Northern Ireland, the salaries of Permanent Secretaries in the CivilService, the salaries of certain classes of the subordinate judiciary and the proposed new salaries for Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen of Boards of nationalised industries as set out in CP. (64) 27.5.  It will be seen:(a) That senior Civil Servants have higher salaries than the English HighCourt Judges, and much higher salaries than the Scots and NorthernIrish Judges. This is the first time that senior Civil Servants have been paid more than the Judges of the English High Court.(b) That, as a result of increases given to the subordinate judiciary in thethree countries consequential on the increases granted to the higher civil Service, the salary relationship between the Higher and LowerJudiciary has become badly distorted. In terms of responsibility and status the salary differentials are now quite unrealistic.6. I already have evidence that the present salary of a High Court Judge inEngland ( 8,000) is not sufficient to be certain of attracting the best men to the bench. If nothing is done soon the situation will deteriorate, and our reputationfor the administration of justice will suffer.7. I recognise that there may be difficulty in according increased salaries tothe Higher Judiciary so long as the pay of Members of Parliament and Ministersremains unimproved. But if we now agree to deal with the nationalised industries and do not at the same time make it plain that we recognise an obligation to dealwith judicial salaries, we shall certainly be accused of neglecting the Judges, whoseclaim to a salary increase is unquestionably strong.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
8. Unlike the salaries of the subordinate judiciary which can be increasedby statutory Order or administrative action, those of the Higher Judiciary are a(present fixed by Act of Parliament and legislation would be necessary.9. The right course would in my view be to introduce a Bill to enable the salaries of the Higher Judiciary to be increased but not decreased by Order inCouncil subject to affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament. The lord chief Justice agrees with me that this proposal would not be regarded as interfering with the independence of the Judiciary in any way: their salaries would remaincharged on the Consolidated Fund.There is already power to increase by Order in Council the salaries of certainclasses of the Lower Judiciary, e.g., County Court Judges. It has enabled mypredecessors and me to keep the salaries of the Lower Judiciary in step with othersalaries in the public service and to maintain the position of the Lower Judiciary.10. Such a Bill would have manifest advantages, particularly for the Judgesthemselves. The salary differential of the whole Judiciary would be constantlymaintained: financial justice would be done to the Judges : and, most importantly,we should be able to ensure that we could always attract the best men from the bar to the High Court Bench.11. I would like to introduce such a Bill this Session even if it did not succeed in passing through all its stages, for to do so would give the Judges a clear assurance that we intended to put their position right.If my colleagues for one reason or another think that this is unacceptable, thenas a second best I should like to have authority to write to the Lord Chief Justice,the Master of the Rolls and the President of the Probate, Divorce and admiralty division to the effect that we intend to deal with this matter next session.,12. Some of the anxiety of the Judges may be due to the fear that anotherGovernment would not be prepared to do anything. Receipt of such a letter fromme would strengthen their position with another Government and would, I think,satisfy them for the time being.But I remain of the opinion that the right course would be for us to introduce a Bill on the lines suggested.13. I would like to consider with the Treasury machinery whereby advicecould be given to the Government with regard to increases in the future. the franks Committee does this in relation to the Civil Service. A Working Party doesit in relation to the Boards of Nationalised Industries. Such machinery may take alittle time to devise and should not, I think, delay a decision on what should bedone now.D.House of Lords, S.W. 1,3rd February, 1964.
