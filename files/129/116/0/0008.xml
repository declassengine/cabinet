CABINETCOMMITMENTS IN PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster GeneralThe Chancellor of the Exchequer^ paper CP. (64) 3 emphasises that &quot; weshould not stoke the boom up further by adding to our already very largecommitments in the field of public expenditure &quot;. This paper shows the implications of this, with particular reference to timing.Estimates for 1964-652. The 1964-65 Estimates were submitted to the Treasury in December ata total of  6,510 million. The final total, when they are presented to Parliament,may rise to about  6,550 million. This figure allows for reductions which havealready been made, or which may still be made: the prospective increase so farforeseen results mainly from the proposed improvements in Service pay and pensions,and the effect on the Railways and Waterways subsidy of the railway pay settlement and consequentials.3.  6,550 million would represent an increase of  411 million or more than6^ per cent over the 1963-64 Budget Estimates of  6,139 million. We have not finally settled the total of Defence Estimates; in particular the amount to beincluded for married quarters by way of increase in the Provision has yet to bediscussed by Cabinet. But it is clear that Defence Estimates for 1964-65 will showan increase of about 9 per cent.4. 6^ per cent is fortunately a considerably lower rate of increase than was envisaged in the paper which I circulated last July on the Forecast EstimatesC. (63) 125. This shows how some of my colleagues have responded to the appealwhich I then made for their co-operation in constraining the growth of theEstimates. The rate of increase in 1964-65 will now be lower than the very high rates of increase in the past two or three years. But the exceptional circumstances which justified these very high rates no longer exist. Last year the economy neededa stimulus. This year the requirements of the economy are the opposite. It hasbeen made clear that there can be little scope for any reduction in taxes in the nearfuture; and to avoid the need for higher taxes the rise in public expenditure of allkinds must be moderated.5. I must therefore ask my colleagues to do all they can, not merely to avoid further increases in the Estimates between now and the time when they are presented, but to co-operate with me in securing every possible saving in them.I shall have to put before the Cabinet all proposals for new services.Resources in 1964 and 19656. As the Chancellor emphasises, we may expect a steady rise in demand in1964, leading to severe pressure on resources in the second half of the year; andthere is no reason to doubt that these conditions of severe pressure will continueinto 1965. All public expenditure creates additional claims on resources, i.e., involves3735HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1964CP.

The public service investment programme for 1965-66 as indicated in the table above would divert resources to the public sector at a time when we areexpecting, and indeed hoping for, a high level of private house-building and arapidly rising level of private industrial investment. If we do nothing about this,it will lead us into difficulty.10. We should normally decide the 1965-66 investment expenditure finallynext July. We should then either maintain the figures that have provisionally beentaken into account in last year&apos;s consideration, or reduce them by a margin of, say,3 per cent, according to how the economic prospects for 1965-66 then looked.This year, it seems so likely that, particularly in this part of the economy, we shallbe under heavy pressure, that I would propose that we now decide to makereductions of, say, 3 per cent and decide to work on that basis. We can, of course,ease up later in the year if it then seems likely that the position is going to be easier than, we now expect. The effect of this would be to reduce the 1965-66programmes by something of the order of  40 million. I am sure that we shouldbe wise to do this, for if we are faced with an increase of, say, 7-\ per cent in publicservice investment (as the figures imply) and probably more in private investment,there will be great congestion in the construction industries, which clearly cannotexpand at anything like this rate. I propose that we ask officials to work out proposals for our consideration accordingly.Defence construction11. Defence construction makes demands on the same elements of our national resources as public service investment, and I suggest that it should alsocontribute to the lightening of the prospective load on the construction industries.Accordingly, I propose that building starts for the Defence Department in 1964-65and 1965-66 should be so arranged that expenditure on major defence works inthe United Kingdom in 1965-66 is not more than about 5 per cent greater than inthe previous year. This would involve some reduction in the number of new startsin 1964-65 now proposed by the Defence Departments. But as this is only areduction in a rapidly rising programme, the overall cost of defence constructionwould still rise by this substantial amount.the use of manpower and materials; and we must therefore make certain that^these addtional claims are as small as possible. It is the decision to start things mm1964 that creates the pressure in 1965 and this applies over the whole field ofpublic expenditure.7. This is most obviously true for public investment, because we know thatthe construction industries will be under pressure. I must make it clear, however,that this problem cannot be solved by expanding the construction industries. If wecan increase their output per worker, it is a contribution. But to draw more resourcesof manpower and machines into the construction industries will not necessarily helpat all; when resources as a whole are scarce which is the situation in 1964 and 1965 to move more to one industry simply means less for others. It is the totality of resources that counts, and which we must avoid overloading.Public sector investment8. The first essential is to ensure that the rate of increase of public service investment in 1965 is not excessive; and this turns on what we start in 1964. Thefollowing table illustrates the increases in the main elements of public service investment on the basis of the 1963 investment review:
Total defence expenditurew 12. Present forecasts of total defence expenditure in 1965-66 show anincrease of  150 million over 1964-65. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Defence will shortly be submitting to the Cabinet the report on thefuture growth of defence expenditure asked for by the Cabinet at their meetingon 12th September (C.C. (63) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 5). An increase of theorder of  150 million in 1965-66 would represent a formidable addition to the prospective load on the economy, and we shall have to seek whatever means maybe open to us for reducing it.Other expenditure13. Throughout the whole public sector the need at this stage is to postponenew projects which would result in expenditure in 1965-66.1967-68 and later14. We have now fully committed our resources for the period up to 1967-68,and have published our plans. There is a contingency allowance in our calculations,but this must be reserved for genuinely unforeseen requirements resulting from theexecution of existing policies.15. We should also be beginning to think about the period beyond 1967-68.During the summer we shall be carrying out the next public expenditure survey.In the light of the survey we shall be determining for a further year the permittedrates of growth which have been established for each public expenditure block,as proposed in my paper of last July on the Long-term Growth of public expenditure (C. (63) 140). It is only by aligning our future expenditure with futureresources that we can hope to remain solvent.16. Major new expenditure commitments are already under consideration for the late 1960s. We must examine these in the context of the programme for public expenditure as a whole. We cannot take sensible decisions on individual projects in isolation.17. Some of the major new commitments which we shall then have to dealwith are:(a) Defence. The total for defence Budget expenditure allowed for in theWhite Paper calculations for 1967-68 is  2,150 million. The Minister ofDefence has indicated that he regards this figure as too low by at least 50 million. In any event, defence expenditure on present plans mayrise by several hundred millions of pounds between 1967-68 and the early1970s. The present programme does not allow for extra commitments on which Ministers have yet to take decisions. A fifth Polaris submarine,for example, would cost another  80 million over the next 10 years,over half of which would fall in the period 1967-68 to 1970-71. If we take part in the NATO multilateral Polaris surface ship force, even witha contribution of only 10 per cent, some  20 million a year will probablybe added to defence expenditure in the late 1960s. There are uncertainties(which might involve very substantial additional expenditure) aboutTSR-2 numbers and equipment, future generations of guided missilesand the replacements of the Hunter and the Sea Vixen and of theBeverley/Hastings transport aircraft. Nor is there any provision in theprogramme for much expenditure on space.(b) Hospitals and Local Authority health and welfare services. investment in these services, calculated to increase from  80 million in 1963-64to nearly  115 million in 1967-68 is now forecast to rise to  125million in 1969-70. At the same time it is clear that there will be greatdifficulty in continuing to restrain the growth of current expenditure within the present figure of 2\ per cent a year.(c) Education. Additional claims arising from a raising of the school leaving age, from industrial training and from the Robbins Report, might increase the 1967-68 figure of over  250 million for educationalinvestment by  20 million in each of the following years. It is estimatedthat the additional current expenditure involved by raising the school leaving age would be about  45 million a year. I hear of quite fantasticproposals from the University Grants Committee for new building.
(d) Roads-Investment  on  major  roads,  calculated  to  increase  froisflfcsomething over  160 million in 1964-65 to  220 million in 1967-68, lWestimated to increase further to  260 million in 1968-69. The Buchananand Crowther Reports will create pressure for further increases in expenditure on urban roads.(e) Electricity. Investment by the Electricity Council and Boards in Englandand Wales already calculated as increasing from  510 million in 1963-64to nearly  700 million in 1967-68, is likely to show further increases to  720 million in 1968-69 and  740 million in 1969-70.Besides these large departmental programmes we are faced with other majoradditional claims and potential claims on our resources.There is, for example, (/) the Concord, which was originally expected to cost 150-170 million in research and development (of which the UnitedKingdom share is half). It is already clear that the cost will be over 200 million, and the figure is increasing all the time. Examples of projects to which we have no commitment but are expected to decidesoon are:(g) Channel tunnel. If work began in 1964-65 the bulk of the UnitedKingdom share of the expenditure would fall in 1968-69 ( 30-35 million)and 1969-70 ( 25-30 million).(h) Decimalisation. If we proceed to decimalise the coinage, with D-dayearly in 1968, the resulting total expenditure (over  100 million) willbe concentrated in 1967-68 and 1968-69.18. In other words, our prospective resources are booked up by the greatexpansion programmes on which we are engaged, and there is no room for more.Conclusions19.  I ask my colleagues to agree that:(a) We must do all we can, not merely to avoid further increases in Estimates1964-65, but to secure savings in them.(b) We must avoid starting new projects which would increase the load onour resources in the period immediately after 1964-65. In particular,we should decide now that:(i) the 1965-66 public service investment programme should be reducedby about 3 per cent;(ii) expenditure on major defence works in the United Kingdom in1965-66 should not be more than about 5 per cent greater thanin 1964-65;and officials should work on this basis.(c) Our existing programme of public expenditure has fully committed our resources for the years up to 1967-68. We cannot take decisions on major new projects of a long-term character involving expenditure inthe period beyond that year until we are in a position to look at themtogether and judge whether they can be accommodated within amanageable programme of total public expenditure.J.
