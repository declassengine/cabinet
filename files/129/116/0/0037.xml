It is a report by officials on the problems arising from the big increasein population expected in South-East England. It is now with the printers; in its final form it will include diagrams and maps.3. The Study is primarily concerned with the supply of housing land for the31 million extra people who will need to be accommodated in the South-East overthe next 20 years or so. It shows that about two-thirds of this increase can beprovided for by the normal processes of land allocation and development; andthat the remaining part will need to be accommodated in a number of new and expanded towns which would help to relieve the heavy pressure of growth on london and the ring around it.4. Land is the key to London&apos;s housing, and I regard the Study as anessential and urgent part of our whole attack on overcrowding and homelessness.Its publication will show that we are tackling these enormous problemscomprehensively and in a progressive way.5. The Study raises a number of important questions on which theGovernment will be expected to express a view. The Secretary of State for Industry,Trade and Regional Development is circulating separately a draft of a White paper to be published at the same time as the Study. This will set out the Government&apos;views on the analysis and proposals contained in it.6. As the Study is a document of some length, I am circulating it to mycolleagues in advance of the draft White Paper.K.

PREFACEThis is the report of a study of the problems that may be expected to arise in South-East England over the next 20 years, as a result of the biggrowth and movements of population that are likely to take place.One of the main purposes of the Study is to provide a basis fordiscussion with local planning authorities on the provision that should bemade, in one way or another, for this growth.The Study was undertaken by the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, acting in close consultation with the other GovernmentDepartments concerned, including the Board of Trade, the Treasury, theMinistry of Transport, the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food. Many of the local planning authorities inthe South-East have contributed information of great value, and usefulhelp has been received from British Railways and London Transport.The White Paper, &quot; South-East England &quot;, which is being published at the same time, explains how far the Government feel able to adopt the analysis of the problem and the tentative proposals suggested in this report.This Study should be read in conjunction with the White Paper.Ministry of Housing and Local Government,Whitehall, S.W. 1.

PART I.-THE PROBLEMCHAPTER 1.-THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM1.1. There are expected to be at least 3  million more people living inSouth-East England by 1981; it might prove to be more. Such an increase will presentformidable problems for what is already the most rapidly growing part of theUnited Kingdom. This report explains why such a large increase should be planned for and suggests the various ways in which the planning of it could most effectivelybe done.1.2. A good deal has been written recently about &quot; the drift to the South &quot;.It is essential to recognise from the start that much the largest single element in thepopulation growth of the South-East is natural increase excess of births overdeaths in the South-East itself. Similarly, the rapid rate of employment growth inthe South-East is not caused by jobs moving from the north, but through differingrates of growth more new jobs being created in the South-East than in otherparts of the country.1.3. Population is growing in every major region of England and Wales,though in the South-East it is growing disproportionately because its economic and social circumstances are particularly favourable to growth. This produces twoproblems-for the South-East itself, further overcrowding and congestion,particularly in London and the ring surrounding it; for other parts of the country,a loss of economic opportunities.1.4. The second problem is not one that can be dealt with in this Studybut the work has been done on the assumption that it will continue to be the government&apos;s policy to channel away economic growth from the South-East toother parts of the country and that, in consequence, the growth in the South-Eastwill be at a lower rate than if current trends were projected.1.5. Part I of the Study shows why it is considered prudent to plan for a population increase as large as 3\ million and considers some special problems inLondon. Part II proposes a broad strategy to be followed in planning for thispopulation, and suggests ways and means. Some of the broad estimates andassumptions made for the purposes of the Study require extensive statisticalillustration. This and material about water supplies has been gathered together inthe appendices.CHAPTER 2.-OBJECT AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY2.1. The main purposes of the Study were explained in the White Paper *&quot; London Employment: Housing: Land &quot;:&quot; The Government recognise that the need to match jobs, land, transport and housing over the next 20 years in London and South-East England calls for a regional plan. . . . The regional study is examining the growth and movement of population in the South-East, including overspill from London,and related employment and transport questions. It will examine the needfor a second generation of new and expanded towns which would provide bothhouses and work for Londoners, well away from London itself and draw offsome of the pressure on the capital.&quot;   ...2.2. A primary aim of the Study is to give the local planning authorities ofthe South-East a framework within which to fit their development plans. They havethe initial responsibility for allocating land for all foreseeable needs for houses,shops, schools, industry and so on-within their area over a period of 20 years,with a review every five years to keep their plans up to date.2.3. But though land has to be allocated locally, some of the issues whichcome into the calculation of the need are more than local ones in particular,population, employment and communications.* This White Paper (Cmnd. 1952 published by H.M.S.O., price 2s.), was presented to parliament in February 1963. It is subsequently referred to in this Study as &quot; the London White Paper &quot;.
2.4. Population change comes partly from migration, and partly from natural!change the balance of births and deaths. Migration movements are extremelycomplex. There is local movement both within and across local planning authorityboundaries; regional movement; overseas migration; migration for work;migration for retirement. Local planning authorities need guidance on how these movements will affect them so that they can make realistic plans. Even naturalchange cannot be calculated locally: national trends in the birth rate and householdformation have to be taken into account. Furthermore, the migration movementsthemselves modify the local balance of births and deaths.2.5. The nature and extent of probable changes in employment can, of course,have a profound effect on future population and on the location and nature ofland needs. Here too, national trends and national policies will influence localcalculations.2.6. It is the same with communications, which to-day play a vital role in planning decisions. Development of the motorway network, for instance, and improvements to the main road system obviously influence the rate of growth of existing towns and are one of the decisive factors in choosing the places for new towns and the towns to expand. These are all national developments, as arechanges in rail communications, port developments and new airports.2.7. Above all, it is necessary to look at the problems of the area as awhole and in a national context. No single planning authority can cope with london&apos;s overspill. No single planning authority can hope to identify for itselfall the complex effects of migration and employment growth, and find solutionswithin its own borders. The problems have to be presented as a whole so that wecan be sure that the solutions, the different elements of which will have to findlocal expression, measure up to the total need. For this growth and movement of population presents problems from which the South-East cannot escape.Scope of the Study2.8. The period taken for the Study is 1961-81, and it seeks to measure the changes likely to occur within that period. There is nothing critical about thesedates. 1961, a census year, makes a good statistical base-line; and 20 years is theperiod commonly taken for long-range land-use planning.2.9. The area examined for the purpose of the Study is the area from theWash to Dorset. In character it ranges from the congested centre of London toremote rural areas where little change is to be expected. London lies at the heart ofthe problems of the South-East, but the wider area was chosen because much of it comes strongly under the influence of London. To the north-west the area is boundedby the vigorously growing regions of the East and West Midlands while to theeast and south the coast makes the natural boundary. For statistical purposes themost convenient area includes Dorset and the whole of the three standardregions, London and South-Eastern, Eastern and Southern, adopted by the registrar-General for the census. But in looking for solutions, the possibilitiesoffered by places further afield have not been overlooked; and some of the townssuggested for large-scale expansion are in fact outside the boundaries of theSouth-East as defined for the purposes of this Study.2.10. There are several important sub-divisions of the region. The mostimportant is the London* conurbation itself. This is the almost continuouslybuilt-up area, with over 8 million inhabitants, lying inside the metropolitan greenbelt. The Study also refers to the small central area (a little more than the areabounded by the main line railway stations) where much of the recent growth in office employment has been concentrated (see Fig. 16 facing page     ).2.11. A much greater area than the conurbation is dominated by theemployment offered by the capital and comes under the pressure of the intensedemands thus created for more housing. The area where this influence is most strongly felt extends over a radius of about 40 miles from Charing Cross, and isknown as the metropolitan region. It contains 70 per cent of the population of theSouth-East and has had 75 per cent of the employment increase over the last seven years. 4  million people live in the outer metropolitan region (that is to say, theWhen this Study refers to &quot; London &quot; without qualification, the London conurbation is meant.
^metropolitan region less the conurbation). This is a crucial part of the South-East.It contains a good deal of the area&apos;s growing industries and population. It also contains nearly all of the existing metropolitan green belt and the green beltextensions proposed by the planning authorities as well as the first generation ofnew towns for London. It is in this ring that most London commuters will henceforthhave to look for homes.Maps2.12. Main sub-divisions of the South-East are shown on Fig. 3. The general reference map in the pocket in the cover shows the main features of the Studyarea on a larger scale (about 10 miles to 1 inch). In the chapters that follow,references are made to other broad divisions of England and Wales the northern region, the Midlands, the South-West and Wales. These areas are shown on Fig. 2.CHAPTER 3.-POPULATION GROWTH IN ENGLAND AND wales.1. Until recently, land use planning was based on the belief that thepopulation level of England and Wales would be static or nearly so and,indeed, that there might even be a fall in population towards the end of thecentury. Concentration in the South-East (particularly in the built-up area ofLondon) was recognised as a problem well before the war, but both the BarlowReport* and the Abercrombie Plan for Greater Londont assumed that it wasdistribution of population and employment, rather than growth that had tobe dealt with. They were right, on the evidence then available; and distribution isstill a major problem. But there has been a dramatic change in the birth rate, and itis clear now that the consequences of growth have to be planned for as well.3.2. Population changes stem from two main causes: natural change,representing the balance of births over deaths, and migration, which covers many different kinds of population movement. The changes that have taken place inEngland and Wales and within the South-East during the period 1951-61 are shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6.Natural Growth3.3.   The trend of natural growth of population has undergone a strikingchange in recent years. The annual number of live births had averaged about600,000 in England and Wales during the thirties and seemed then to presage a. static or even a declining population. As was to be expected, it rose sharply at theend of the war to a peak of 881,000 in 1947.3.4. At that time the Registrar-General, in making his first populationprojections for planning purposes, assumed that there would be a sharp fall fromthis peak, but his resultant projection for the period to 1971 did not, and indeedat the time could not, foresee the change in the birth rate which took place fromthe middle of the &apos;fifties on.3.5. The annual number of live births did in fact fall more or less as expected in the early &apos;fifties and reached a nadir of 668,000 in 1955. From then onwards a wholly unexpected rise took place, which is still continuing. In 1962, the last year for which figures are available, the number was 839,000, the highest for anypost-war year except 1947.3.6. This increase will have a very big effect on land use planning. the registrar-GeneraPs population projection in 1948 on which the first round of local planning authorities&apos; development plans were based supposed a civilian populationof England and Wales in 1971 of 45-28 million, a natural - increase of about million during the two decades 1951-71. But, between 1951 and 1961, natural increase in England and Wales, only marginally influenced by net inward migrationfrom Scotland and overseas, came to just under 2 million, or virtually the 20-year* Report of the Royal Commission on the Industrial Population (Cmd. 6135).f Greater London Plan, 1944.
expected increase in the first 10. In other words, the volume of natural growtflduring the decade 1951-61 proved almost twice as large as had been originallyexpected.3.7. The projections for England and Wales are revised annually. During thelast 10 years these revisions have shown an upward trend, and the latest takesfull account of the rise in births since 1955. Inevitably there is a considerable timelagbetween revising the projections and incorporating the revisions in development plans. Consequently most current development plans do not yet provide adequatelyfor the likely natural growth of population.3.8. The birth rate continues to rise, marriages take place earlier and couplestend to start having their children earlier. Wives of post-war marriages are stillgenerally of child-bearing age, so it is too early to draw firm conclusions aboutthe average number of children in families. But the general effect of these trendsis to speed up the whole reproductive cycle, and to build in more population growth for the future. In other words, the length of a generation is shorteningand it is becoming steadily more likely that the parents of to-day will live to see their great-grandchildren.3.9. Forecasts of natural increase for the future have to take account of thesetrends. The next detailed projection for planning purposes, expected in 1964, willbe based on the detailed demographic data made available by the 1961 census.The latest annual projection issued by the Government Actuary indicated a natural growth of the population of England and Wales of about 6 million for the period1961-81; only 15 years ago, the natural increase forecast for a 20-year period was2 million. The disparity shows how the prospects have been revolutionised by therapidly increasing birth rates.3.10. That is not the end of the story. Further big population increases areexpected after the end of the period covered by this Study; in the last 20 yearsof the century, the rate of growth is expected to be even higher. The projectionsof natural growth published in April 1963, were based on the assumption that therewould be 853,000 live births in 1962-63, an annual average of 870,000 in the years1963-67, with a gradual increase thereafter to 1,130,000 live births annually atthe end of the century (see Fig. 8).3.11. These figures of natural increase are in terms of persons. It is not atpresent possible to produce useful projections of the growth of households,because the household structure of the existing population will not be accuratelyknown until the full results of the 1961 census are available. But between 1951and 1961 the number of households grew by 12 per cent while the civilian population increased by only 6 per cent; a continuation of this trend would add further to land needs because of the increased demand for separate dwellings.There is the further point that there will be strong household growth in the periodof the Study as a consequence of the high national birthrate just after the war andthe return to a rising trend in the mid-&apos;fifties.Migration3.12. In addition to this natural increase, some further growth of thepopulation of England and Wales by immigration is likely during the period ofthe Study. During the years 1951-61 the net gain from this source amounted torather more than a quarter of a million (0 - 7 per cent of the indigenous population.)This was made up of two components (a) net immigration from overseas, and (b)net immigration from other parts of the United Kingdom. The relative size ofthese two components can only be guessed at, pending publication of the relevantpart of the 1961 census. It is clear, however, that there have been steady netmovements of population from Northern Ireland and Scotland into England andWales throughout the period. With overseas migration, there was a sharp changeof trend during the decade. In the early years, there was probably a small net lossof population to the older Commonwealth countries, a loss that was sharplyovertaken by heavy immigration mainly from the West Indies, India and Pakistanin the late &apos;fifties and early &apos;sixties.3.13. In 1961-62, there was an estimated net migration gain of 226,000 nearly as much as in the whole of the preceding decade. But this was an exceptionalyear the last of unrestricted movement before the Commonwealth ImmigrantsAct took effect. Forecasts for the future are necessarily very tentative, as
international movement is sharply influenced by economic and political changes,fjut it is clear that, given continued national prosperity, further immigration,though at a reduced level, is likely from overseas, quite apart from movement from Scotland and Northern Ireland. The national estimate is not of crucial importance for the South-East, for internal as well as international movementsmust be taken into account there. But the latest official estimate is that Englandand Wales may expect to gain 1 million in population by net immigration duringthe period of the Study, over and above the 6 million by natural increase.3.14. Thus, over the period 1961-81, the population of England and wales is likely to grow by 7 million from a starting figure of 45 - 9 million.CHAPTER 4.-EMPLOYMENT IN THE SOUTH-EASTEmployment and Population4.1. The following Table shows the population changes which have takenplace in the major regions of England and Wales over the last 10 years and illustrates the close relationship normally existing between changes in employment and population.Table IEmployment and Migration, 1951-61Employment Increase1952-62(per cent of insuredemployees)4-0:.. 4-412-413-314-northern EnglandWales        ......Midlands    ......South-West. EnglandSouth-East EnglandMigration Gain or Loss1951-61(per cent of total population)-2-0-2+ 1+2+2Total, England and Wales ...10-30-7These changes reflect the comparative prosperity of the south and the midlands onthe one hand, and the comparative lack of employment growth, on the other hand,in the north and (at any rate in the earlier years) in Wales. All these major regionsenjoyed population increases as a result of natural growth: but Wales lost 50,000migrants, and Northern England over a quarter of a million. The Midlands andthe South-East were able to absorb not only their natural increase, but immigrantsas well 413,000 in the South-East. Reliable employment figures cannot be producedfor exactly the same decade, but the link between employment growth and population increase is illustrated by the fact that during the 10 years 1952-62, thenumber of employees in the South-East grew by over a million. This represents an increase of almost 15 per cent, or more than twice the rate in the rest of Englandand Wales (7-4 per cent). Fig. 9 shows the differing rates of employment growth in the major divisions of the country during the period 1955-62.4.2. In the future, as in the past, the South-Easfs share of the total nationalpopulation growth will be strongly influenced by the structure of its economy.The forces making for increases in population and employment in the South-Eastare very strong. London itself naturally dominates the whole area and is a tremendous magnet. Its geographical advantages have marked it out as the naturalcapital since Roman times. For centuries it has been not only the seat ofGovernment and justice, but the biggest port in the country and the centre ofnational and international commerce as well as a main industrial area.Employment Structure4.3. With the development of motor transport and of power from oil and electricity, many of the newer industries are attracted by easy access to ports andairports, by proximity to the mass markets offered by the big centres of population and by the supply of scarce technical staff.
. 4.4. Northern England and the South-East each provide employment fo^almost exactly the same number of workers in manufacturing industry (2f million).But, when the different categories of industry are examined, the results are very different (see Fig. 10). In the country as a whole the industries which show the strongest employment growth (i.e., those which have increased their labour force by more than 20 per cent over the last three years) employed over half-a-million people in 1962. But more than half this employment was found in the South-East,and little more than a fifth in Northern England. At the other end of the scale,54 per cent of the employment in the industries declining most sharply (loss ofmore than 20 per cent in the labour force) was in Northern England, and only22 per cent in the South-East.4.5. This detailed analysis was based on a breakdown of employment basedon the Minimum List Heading classification,^ and it is impossible to extend this analysis back over a longer period. Special statistics, however, have been preparedto show changes in the numbers employed in all forms of employment by the broader Industrial Order classification for Great Britain as a whole over the10-year period 1952-62. This more general analysis similarly reveals an unevendistribution over England and Wales of the strongly-growing industries. In termsof total employment in 1962, 40 per cent of all jobs were located in the South-East,and 30 per cent in Northern England; for those Industrial Orders showing the strongest employment growth in the decade, about 45 per cent of employment wasin the South-East and less than 28 per cent in Northern England. Conversely40 per cent of employment in those Industrial Orders showing any decline in their labour forces was in Northern England and only 29 per cent in the South-East(see Appendix 2, Table 19).4.6. This difference in industrial structure has been reflected in current rates(1959-62) of increase in manufacturing employment in the South-East. The nationalrate of increase was 5 per cent; but in the South-East it was 6 - 6 per cent, and in thenorth only 1 - 5 per cent (see Appendix 2, Table 18).4.7. The pattern of other forms of employment also favours growth in theSouth-East as Fig. 11 shows. Agriculture and mining and quarrying are providing a diminishing amount of employment; but the South-East has -a small share of these industries. They provide 2-8 per cent of total employment in the South-East, asagainst 5 - 4 per cent in England and Wales as a whole. Service industry t (transport,distribution, building, commerce, entertainment, etc.) is growing faster than other forms of employment. This is most strongly represented in the South-East (64 percent of total employment as against 55 per cent for England and Wales as a whole).4.8. The general picture, therefore, is of an employment structure which already contains the seeds of much further growth. If new jobs were created in theSouth-East at the same rate as they have been for either the 10 years 1952-62 (over1 million) or the seven years 1955-62 (over f million), there would be 2 millionextra workers by 1981: equivalent to a population increase of about 4 million.But if the rate of increase over the last three years (1959-62) were to be sustained,there would be 3 million extra workers, corresponding to a population increase of6 million by 1981. These employment increases in the short term reflect normalfluctuations in trade and prosperity which are unlikely to be maintained over along period. But, given that a main aim of national policy is economic growth and the achievement of an annual 4 per cent growth rate, there is nothing inherentlyimprobable about the lower figures. These reflect conditions over the longerperiods 1952-62 and 1955-62, which included bad years as well as good ones.Effects of Government Action4.9. The rate of growth in the South-East is susceptible to government action, in the form of direct control over the location of new industry andof measures to build up the economic strength and attractiveness of the lessprosperous regions. In considering what allowance should be made for this, it hasto be recognised that the current employment increases in the South-East havetaken place over a period during which there have been vigorous efforts to divert* Standard Industrial Classification: Central Statistical Office. Consolidated Edition 1963(H.M.S.O. price     ).f Throughout this Study the term &quot; service industry &quot; is used to cover Industrial Orders XVII toXXIV of the Standard Industrial Classification i.e., construction; gas, electricity and water; transport and communication; distributive trades; financial, professional and miscellaneous services; andpublic administration and defence.
i&quot;ome part of the growth in manufacturing industry to other parts of the country,industrial projects new to the South-East are unlikely to receive industrialdevelopment certificates from the Board of Trade; and even extensions to existingfactories are not approved unless the Board of Trade are satisfied that the work could not be transferred out of the area.4.10. Industrial building authorised by the Board of Trade, and completedbetween 1952 and 1961, was estimated to provide 203,800 additional jobs in theSouth-East representing 2-8 per cent of all the employment there in 1952. Duringthe same years completions for Northern England provided 202,700 new jobs, or3-4 per cent of the total in 1952. For Wales, the percentage was as high as4-8 per cent. In the London conurbation it was only 1-0 per cent (see Fig. 12).4.11. The Board of Trade&apos;s control covers only manufacturing employment,and much of the growth is in the service trades. A good deal of this employment(e.g., retail trade, communications, and personal services of one sort or another) istied to the population it serves. It will grow with that population and is not easilysusceptible either to control or persuasion.Distribution of Growth in the South-East4.12. It is not only the total amount of employment growth in the South-Eastthat presents problems; both the distribution of this growth and its composition areuneven. Over the period 1955-62, over three-quarters of a million additional jobswere created in the South-East as a whole; this represented an increase of just over 10 per cent, as compared with 6-8 per cent for England and Wales. In Londonitself, the rate of increase was actually below the national average (6 - 6 per cent);in the South-East outside the metropolitan region it was TO-9 per cent. But in the outer metropolitan region, there were well over a quarter of a million extra jobs an increase of over 20 per cent.4.13. Although the percentage increase in the conurbation was comparativelylow, in terms of numbers it was large an increase of nearly 300,000. Very little ofthis growth was in manufacturing industry; five out of every six additional jobswere in the service trades, including offices. Much of the new employment was concentrated in the small central area and, although there are no separate statistics,it seems likely that the rate of growth within this small part of London was wellabove the national average.4.14. The size and composition of the employment increase in the outer metropolitan region reflected the policy of decentralisation of London by thecreation of new towns, and the drastic curbs which were placed on industrial expansion in the conurbation both by Government controls and by lack of spaceto grow. In this ring around London, manufacturing industry is far more stronglyrepresented than in the South-East as a whole (41-7 per cent of all employmentagainst 33-5 per cent); it is even above the average for England and Wales(39-2 per cent). During the period 1955-62 three-fifths of the employment increasein the outer metropolitan region was in manufacturing industry.Future Growth in the South-East4.15. All the factors point towards the conclusion that there is unlikely tobe any sudden decrease in the numbers of jobs being created in the region. special problems are presented by the concentration of growth in office employment in thevery small central area of London, and by the rapid rate of industrial growth inthe outer metropolitan region.CHAPTER 5.-POPULATION GROWTH IN THE SOUTH-EAST5.1. It was said in Chapter 3 that England and Wales as a whole can expecta population increase of 7 million during the period 1961-81, 6 million by natural increase and one million by net immigration. The next step is to estimate the share of this growth that will&quot; fall to the South-East.5.2. It is necessary to emphasise that the prediction of future populationchanges, over a period as long as 20 years, is a hazardous business, and that considerable margins of error are possible. Particularly where migration is
concerned, the sources of information are far from adequate. It will be necessargto amend the estimates made from time to time, as more information becomes1available (for example, when the migration stream analysis of the 1961 census is published at about the end of 1964) or as changes of trend become evident.Throughout the chapter, however, where there is a choice of assumptions the one that produced the smallest estimate of growth in the South-East has been selected;much higher figures would be produced by the straightforward projection of current trends.Natural Increase5.3. In estimating the likely change, the two main components natural increase and migration cannot be kept entirely separate. If there is a net balanceof migration into a region, there is a direct addition to numbers. Since the regionaltotal becomes higher, the level of natural increase will also be higher the more people there are, normally the more children they are likely to have.5.4. But there is an even more important consequence of migration.Migration is usually described in net terms i.e., the difference between the totalmoving into and out of a country or a region. It is known that these net totalsmask very much larger gross movements which, in a city like London, can makebig changes in the population and household structure even though there is no net increase or even a decline in the total population. Young people move in towork; older people move out (to other parts of the South-East or further afield)to retire. There is a constant rejuvenation of the population, and consequently separately of natural growth far higher than would be expected if the population werestatic.5,5. Over the last few decades there has been a steady increase in theSouth-Easfs share of the total natural increase of England and Wales. In thetwenties, this was 33 per cent.; in the thirties, 36 per cent. Between 1956 and1962 the period which saw the reversal of international migration trends thepercentage was higher still (39-3 per cent). -5.6. If this upward tendency were to continue, the South-East could expect to receive well over 40 per cent of the natural increase in England and Walesover the next 20 years. For the purposes of this Study, however, it has been assumed that the tendency for the South-East to increase its proportion of thenatural growth of the population at the expense of other parts of the country willbe arrested, and that each of the major regions referred to in paragraph 13 of chapter 2 will hold a higher proportion of its natural increase.5.7. On this basis, the natural growth in the South-East that is, the excessof births over deaths taking place in the region would amount to 39-3 per cent of the Government Actuary&apos;s national projection of 6 million in the period 1961-81,namely 2-4 million. The position in other major regions is set out in the followingtable:Table IINatural Increase, 1961-81	mil	ionsNorthern England         ...      ......	......       1	8Wales       ...      .....	......       0	2Midlands.................	......       1	4South-West England      .........	......       0	3South-East England       .........	......       2	4Total, England and Wales......	......       6	1The national total is higher than the figure of 6 million quoted in Chapter 3because of the effect of international immigration on natural growth.Past Migration5.8. To this estimate of natural growth must be added an estimate of increase by net migration. Some guidance is offered by the total figures of net movement for each region during the decade 1951-61. It is estimated, for example, that theSouth-East gained 413,000&quot;migrants over the 10-year period; but, until the detailed analysis of migration from the 1961 census is available, it is not known what overall
r&amp;fcolume of movement produced these net figures, nor. in numerical terms, where^nhe migrants came from or went to. It is impossible, therefore, to work on thebasis that the South-East received, for example, so many Scots and so manyNorthumbrians over the last decade and try to work out detailed adjusted figuresfor the future. This method would, in any event, produce cumulative errors.Indeed, it is not necessary to arrive at such figures for the purpose of the presentStudy, since the object is to determine the total population for which provision must be made in the South-East.Factors Governing Future Migration5.9. The method adopted has been to consider what total rate of migrationinto the South-East appears likely; having regard to the estimate made of immigration into England and Wales as a whole, and making allowance for thefact that the regional studies for Central Scotland and North-East England include in their objectives a reduction in the rate of migration out of those areas. In orderto make proper allowance for the migration assumptions in those regional studies,and for the more general objectives of Government policy to secure a more evenspread of prosperity and a more even use of resources over the country as awhole the present Study assumes that future net migration gain in the South-Eastwill constitute a smaller proportion of the national total than in the last decade.5.10. Past experience shows that, because of inter-regional movement, netmigration into the South-East has exceeded, by a considerable margin, the netmigration into England and Wales as a whole. During 1951-61, the net migrationgain for the South-East was 413,000 as against 287,000 for England and Wales.For the period 1961-81, the net gain for England and Wales is estimated atone million.5.11. If past ratios were preserved, a national migration gain of one million would imply a net migration gain of 1-4 million in the South-East; but such anestimate would be incompatible with the assumption that a more even distributionof prosperity should lead to a proportionately smaller allocation of migration gainto the South-East.5.12. It would, on the other hand, be unrealistic to assume that the amountof migration gain in the South-East over the next 20 years will be no larger thanthe mean rate between 1951 and 1961 (which would give a figure of 826,000) for there were clear signs that, during the last decade, the rates of immigration bothinto England and Wales as a whole and into the South-East were increasing,partly as a result of the change in balance in Commonwealth migration. The rateof employment growth in the South-East has also been faster than in the rest ofthe country; in the last three years, the rate of increase was double that in thepreceding three years. Allowance must also be made for migration which is noteconomic in its motive migration for retirement. Numbers of elderly people cometo the South-East, many of them to seaside resorts. This type of migration will certainly continue and may well increase.5.13. If nothing were to change, these factors would point to a sharp increasein the rate of net migration into the South-East over the next 20 years. There mustbe set against them the considerable efforts being made to stimulate the economies of the northern regions, to divert a greater proportion of the expanding industries of the South-East and to provide better housing and more modern towns in thenorth. But it will take time before the full effect of these measures is felt. If theeconomic incentive to migration is to be removed, the new industries in the northwill not only have to provide work for those now unemployed. They will have to offset future losses of employment in the older, declining industries, and producejobs for the strong natural increase in the population of these regions.5.14. The creation of new jobs in the north is not expected to have mucheffect on retirement migration; nor will it necessarily diminish the rate of overseasmigration into the South-East. Indeed, if the supply of migrant labour from thenorth is reduced, and if employment growth of a kind that cannot be divertedcontinues in the South-East, employers may seek more workers from elsewhere.5.15. Allowing for all these factors, it has been assumed that net migrationinto the South-East over the period of the Study will amount to rather more thanone million persons (say 1 -1 million). This estimate lies roughly mid-way betweenthe two extreme points (826,000 and 1-4 million) mentioned above.CONFIDENTIAL3878 c
The Basis for Planning5.19. Two questions may well be asked. What confidence can be placed in population forecasts for the future, when they have gone so badly astray in the past?And is it not an admission of defeat to plan for so large an increase in theSouth-East?5.20. The answer to the first question is that we must be alert for signs of change and ready to review plans as the passage of time brings new evidence tosupport or contradict the assumptions made. On the other hand, while many of the calculations are subject to a wide margin of error, most of the main trendsunderlying them are now well established. Mistakes in the forecasts are thereforebest considered as errors of timing rather than of quantity. In other words, it isnot so much whether a particular level of population will be reached as when.5.21. The second question is a vital one, and the answer to it lies in the main purpose of this Study. This is to give guidance on the amount of provision thatneeds to be made for likely population growth in the South-East. This meansprimarily the allocation by the local planning authorities of sufficient land for development, and, to the extent that this is necessary, the planning of new townsand town expansions. If this provision is to have real meaning it must be basedon realistic estimates of the amount of growth that is likely to take place in theSouth-East, and not on more comfortable assumptions that may quickly be falsifiedby events. It takes several years before the idea of a new town in a given area canbe translated into homes, factories, shops and offices on the ground. It is much easier to slow down the execution of plans, if the need develops later than expected,than to be forced into a crash programme because the needs were under-estimated.5.22. Similarly with land allocations. Through no fault of the planning authorities, the current development plans fall well short of real needs, and manyof them have not yet been revised to meet the requirements of the Seventies. Ifthese deficiencies are not corrected and corrected with a good margin of tolerancefor the future artificial land shortages are likely to be created, land prices drivenup higher, and the planning machine overwhelmed.5.23. Planning for a proper distribution of the future population of theSouth-East is not inconsistent with the effort to reduce the flow of migration fromthe north. For the north such a reduction is vital; but it will not alter the generalscale of the need to allocate land for development in the South-East. As was shownin Chapter 3, if employment growth were to continue at current levels, very heavypopulation increases could be expected. There can be little doubt that, over the20-year period, growth in the South-East will call for an increase in the labour forcecorresponding to a population growth of at least 3\ million. The region is thereforelikely to retain the whole of its natural increase and to attract the balance fromone source or another.5.24. The indications are that if the forecast of a population increase of3Jr million during the period of the Study proves to be wrong, it is more likely to bean under-estimate than an over-estimate.5.16.  Most of the migrants will be men and women of working age, sorrJfewith their families, but perhaps as many as 250,000 might be elderly peoplecoming for retirement. But pending publication of data from the 1961 census,these sub-divisions are highly speculative, and the figure quoted for retirementmigration may well prove to be too high.Total Population Growth5.17. Thus, the total population growth to be catered for in the South-Eastover the period 1961-81 is 3  million; a little over a million migrants, a little lessthan 2\ million born in the South-East.5.18. The distribution of the additional population over the South-East forms the main subject of the later parts of this Study. Of the natural increase, one million is likely to take place in the London conurbation, 870,000 in the outer metropolitan region, and only 475,000 in the whole of the rest of the South-East, onthe assumption that these areas continue to maintain their present proportion ofthe natural increase in the South-East.
CHAPTER 6.-LONDON6.1. The heart of the South-East problem lies in London and the ringsurrounding it. It is this metropolitan region that contains the greatest concentration of population and the greatest amount of employment growth in recent years. Thislimited area is likely to have a high percentage of the future growth in theSouth-East.6.2. It is also here that land pressures are at their greatest. There is strongnatural increase in the present population both of the conurbation and of the outer metropolitan area; and the growth of service employment (including offices) inLondon, and of manufacturing employment in the rest of the metropolitan region,tends to pull more workers in. Thus a keen demand for houses and housing landis set up. The conurbation itself is virtually built up, and there are only limitedpossibilities of adding to the total stock of housing in London over the period ofthis Study. London cannot meet all its own housing needs, and some part of thesolution must be found in the outer metropolitan region. But this area in turn has its own problems of growth; and it contains the approved metropolitan green beltand the extensions to it which have been proposed by the local planning authorities.6.3. This Chapter deals particularly with the housing demands of London,and examines the ways in which they can, in part, be dealt with inside theconurbation. The balance represents overspill population who will need homeselsewhere.Some History6.4. People have been saying that something ought to be done about london for nearly 400 years the first legislation on the subject goes back to Elizabeth I.But London has not stood still; the spread of the built-up area over the last centuryand a half is shown in Fig. 13. Before the war, tentative steps were taken towardsthe preparation of a plan for London and the surrounding country, and the ideaof a green belt took shape.6.5. Towards the end of the thirties, with the double pressure ofunemployment and the approach of war, the economic and strategic dangers of allowing so much industry and population to silt up in the corner of Englandnearest Europe caused the Government to appoint a Royal Commission under sir Montague Barlow to investigate the problem.6.6. The Commission, which reported in 1940, recognised that the drift of population and industry to the South-East was a problem demanding attention.They recommended, among other things, that its effects should be mitigated by restricting industrial building in London and the Home Counties, redevelopinginner London and dispersing industry and population away from the London area.6.7. As a consequence, when Sir Patrick Abercrombie came to prepare hisPlan for Greater London, he made two assumptions and they were very reasonableones to make at the time which have since been falsified by events. He assumed that no new industry would be admitted to London and the Home Counties exceptin special circumstances, and that the population of the area would not only, not increase, but would be reduced.6.8. The first assumption went wrong because nobody then foresaw that,although a tight check would be maintained over the growth of manufacturing industry, the big employment growth in London during the &apos;fifties was to be informs of employment not subject to industrial location control in service industryand, in particular, in office employment. This change in emphasis from factory floorto white collar work is one of the most important features of post-war London. In1954, the number of factory workers in the County of London was actually wellbelow the pre-war figure about a quarter of a million less and little of the growththat has taken place since then has been in manufacturing industry. The turningpoint came in the mid-&apos;fifties, which saw the beginning of the office building boomin Central London. Over the last decade well over 150,000 more office jobs havebeen created in the central area alone. Over the three years 1959-62, nearly 200,000new jobs were created in the conurbation as a v/hole, and over four-fifths of these were in service employment (which includes offices).
6.9. The second assumption was overtaken by the unexpected surge in thjnational birthrate which started in 1955. It has also been affected by migration toLondon for work. Numerically, this element has not been large, and, in theconurbation itself, is balanced by the outward movement of other people goingto work elsewhere, looking for homes in the commuter belt, or retiring. But, as hasbeen shown in Chapter 5, the effect of migration turnover of this kind in london is to increase the rate of natural growth.The Green Belt6.10. Meanwhile, the London green belt was taking shape. The history of the green belt, the machinery for setting it up and extending it, and development controlpolicy within green belts are all fully described in the booklet &quot; The Green Belts &quot;*issued by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in 1962. The conception of a green belt around London owes much to this same idea of a static population.A green girdle could be flung round the capital, some of its population and industrymoved out to new towns beyond it, and the elbow room thus created used to improveliving conditions in the conurbation. Specific proposals for a green belt about fivemiles wide around London were made &quot;in the Abercrombie Plan. These wereembodied in the development plans of the local planning authorities, and, in theprocess, the belt was widened to between six and ten miles. This ring covers 840square miles and is known as the &quot; approved &quot; green belt, since it is incorporated in development plans approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government.The local planning authorities have, in addition, made proposals for the extensionand strengthening of the green belt. These proposals, some of which have beensubmitted to the Minister as formal amendments to development plans, but none of which has so far been approved, would add another 1,200 square miles to the green belt. (These areas are shown in Fig. 25, page     .)6.11. Within the green belt, there is a presumption against building that isnot tied to uses which belong to open countryside for example, agriculture, sportand recreation. Furthermore, the intention is that these restrictions should be permanent, and that a green belt, once its boundaries have been firmly fixed in an approved development plan, should remain for as long as can be foreseen. By thismeans, the physical growth of a large built-up area like London can be checked, and towns can be stopped from merging into one another.6.12. Thus, the early plans under-estimated the needs which were to arise and the establishment of the green belt prevented the satisfaction of these needsby the traditional and in many places highly damaging method of peripheralspread. Some of the deficiencies were made good, because, by the time the planning authorities in the Metropolitan Region started to make their plans, the doctrine ofstatic population had been modified a little. More important, however, Abercrombiehad demonstrated the need for a coherent policy of getting people and work out ofLondon. This part of the plan was implemented by the creation of eight new townsnear London, with an eventual population of over half a million, and by thesanctioning of schemes for the accommodation of nearly a quarter of a million people in expansions of existing towns (see Fig. 14); and there was also muchvoluntary movement out of London.More Households6.13. Other developments have added to the land needs of London and indeedof the country generally. One is the gradual change which has been taking place inthe average size of households requiring a separate home. This is a long term trend:and one reason for it is that most modern households consist simply of the married couple and their children. With greater prosperity and better housing, youngmarried couples are less likely to live with their in-laws; and more elderlypeople have their own homes, instead of living with married children. In 10 years,the average size of private households in the London conurbation fell from 3-02persons to 2 - 85. What this means is that now, and increasingly so in the future, moredwellings will be needed to house any given number of people than in the past.The Motor Car6.14. Equally important is the growth of motor traffic. More land will haveto be given up to the motor car. A garage for every new dwelling and two for* Published by H.M.S.O., price 4s. 6d.CONFIDENTIAL
/3jpie. More parking space. Above all, more and wider roads. All these requirements^fill eat into land allocations which 10 years ago could have been safely left forother purposes. The report of the Hall Group* forecast a doubling in the numberof cars by 1970 and a trebling by 1980; the impact on London will be considerable.Since then the Buchanan Report t has described the implications of this for the bigger towns; and how it might be provided for. This Study is not directly concernedwith the effect of this on London&apos;s internal problems of making the motor carcompatible with decent living conditions. The point here is that the motor car islikely to be a strong competitor for land in London itself.London&apos;s Housing Needs6.15. For many years now the resident population of the London conurbationhas been failing slowly but steadily. This happens in most, big cities. There comesa point in the history of a town when the pattern of development changes. Theresidential areas in the centre become worn-out and have to be replaced. If houses are put back on them, higher living standards usually demand a more spaciouslay-out, with wider streets, more schools, shops and open space. But very oftenthe valuable land on the fringes of the town centre goes over to commercial usesof one sort or another. People choose to live further and further away from thecentre, bartering a longer daily journey to work for fresh air and quietersurroundings in the evenings and at week-ends. This kind of thing has beenhappening on a massive scale in London, with the result that the City is desertedat night and residential uses have been pushed further and further out. Such is thescale of things in London that finding a home on the outskirts nowadays meansgoing beyond the suburbs, to the green belt and the countryside beyond. Fig. 15illustrates the pattern of change.6.16. During the period 1951-61 the London conurbation gained nearly400,000 by natural increase and the return of servicemen to civilian life; yet,during the same period, its population fell by 189,000 (from 8-321 million to-132 million). This is because there was a net outward migration of 583,000. Overa quarter of a million people went to new and expanded towns under plannedoverspill schemes. Some of the remainder no doubt were leaving London for retirement in the country or by the sea, but very many out of the balance of over300,000 moved out of London to the commuter ring and went on working inLondon. The population of the conurbation has been falling, even though thenumber of dwellings in it has increased.6.17. During this same period the number of jobs in London was increasing by nearly a quarter of a million in the six years 1955-61 alone. The combined effectof this decline in resident population and increase in employment is that London ishousing an even smaller proportion of the people who have to work there and,if present trends continue, will need to look more and more beyond its ownboundaries for houses and housing land. It is necessary to establish the likelysize of these demands; in fact to estimate the amount of overspill populationfor whom provision of one sort or another must be made.6.18.   More houses are needed for Londoners for three main purposes:(i) to replace the slums;(ii) to make good the existing shortage of housing; and(iii) to provide for the population growth of London.Replacement Housing6.19. While the first of these heads has an important place in the housing programme for London, it has less effect on the calculation of the size of theoverspill problem. The reason for this is that the problem is essentially one of replacement. The slum areas being cleared are mostly at high density; but theplanners and architects of the local authorities use all their skill to squeeze theutmost from these sites.* The Transport Needs of Great Britain in the next Twenty Years: H.M.S.O., price 2s. 6d.t Traffic in Towns: A Study of the Long-term Problems of Traffic in Urban Areas: Reports ofthe Steering Group and Working Party appointed by the Minister of Transport: H.M.S.O., price 2 10s.
Relief of Overcrowding fg6.20. But very many additional houses-requiring land will have to be built if every separate London family wanting its own home is to have one. Asthe London White Paper showed, much of the backlog has been overtaken. Since1951, 300,000 additional dwellings have been provided, and the gap between thenumber of houses and the number of families wanting them has been reduced to less than half. Nevertheless, much remains to be done. The 1961 census showed that there were 2\ million dwellings in London, and 2f million families as definedfor census purposes. For the purposes of assessing housing need, the gap is not as great as a quarter of a million, for the &quot; census &quot; household includes lodgersand others who do not require a separate home. The best estimate that can bemade suggests that the demand is of the order of 150,000, if doubling up andovercrowding in London are to be eliminated.Growth in Population and Households6.21. Even more houses will be needed to meet the growth in the populationof the capital. It was estimated in Chapter 5 that this would amount to about one million persons. But in calculating housing demand, it is not enough to knowthis; it is necessary to know how many extra families will have to be providedfor. This will be more than a simple division sum would suggest, for more andmore households are being formed every year out of the existing population; evenif the population of London did not grow at all, more houses would be neededeach year to accommodate the increasing number of smaller households which aresteadily being formed. &quot;One conclusion to be drawn from this is that a higherpercentage of small dwellings should be included in the London housing programme.6.22. The best estimate that can be made under this head is that, allowingboth for natural increase and for the declining average size of households, 400,000extra dwellings will be needed for population growth *.6.23. Thus if these two main needs are to be met (and there are others,as will be seen) 550,000 additional houses will be required during the 20-year period, over and above replacement building.London&apos;s Housing Capacity6.24. How far can these needs be met in London itself? An estimate of thiskind can only be a rough one without a very detailed study of the land use patternin the whole of the conurbation, and this is something which must await the setting up of the Greater London Council. The existing development plans of thelocal authorities are only of limited help, because only one of them Middlesex has so far undertaken a review which extends to 1981. Valuable help has, however,been received from all the planning authorities in the conurbation in thepreparation of an approximate estimate of future housing capacity.6.25. The outstanding fact is that the conurbation lying inside the green beltis virtually built over, and there is very little land indeed that can be released for house-building. This means that, to an ever-increasing extent, housing gains mustbe wrung out of redevelopment, a process which is slower, more difficult and more complicated than building on virgin land.Housing Densities in London6.26. The acute need for more housing for Londoners inevitably leads tothe suggestion that this should be provided by stepping up the housing densitiesin London itself. There are three main types of area that need to be considered.There are the closely packed residential areas of inner London, some of themslums and ripe for redevelopment. There are the outer suburbs, built at lowdensities between the wars. And in between, there are the older Victorian andEdwardian houses.* It may be asked why no separate allowance is made for migrants. The answer is that, althoughpeople do migrate to London for work, the London conurbation the unit examined in this chapter suffers a net loss by migration for the reasons that have been explained. But one effectof these migratory movements is to produce a &quot; young &quot; population in London, and this boosts therate of natural increase.
m 6.27. It is doubtful whether there can be much housing gain fromYedeyeloping the obsolescent residential areas of inner London at much higherdensities. Existing densities are very high, ranging up to 300 persons per acre and the environmental standards are low. When these areas are rebuilt, someland must be set aside for non-housing uses schools, shops, wider streets andsome open space in the interests of civilised living standards. High densities overa wide area-and particularly in the centre of a great city are likely to produceintolerable living conditions and social unease. It is an expensive process, too,for land and construction costs are high.6.28. In the low density outer suburbs, there is much more physical scope for redevelopment. There are thousands of acres of land built on at low densities,and even quite modest increases could add greatly to their capacity, if unifiedsites big enough to warrant comprehensive redevelopment could be obtained. Butthis will not be practicable for many years to come. Most of these houses were built less than 40 years ago, are owner-occupied and in sound condition. there could be no question of pulling them down during the period of this Study. Suchgains as may be possible here will come later.6.29. There are, on the other hand, big prospects of increasing London&apos;housing stock in the older suburbs. Many examples are already to be seen of thesuccessful redevelopment, by private builders, of the sites of Victorian housesstanding in large gardens. In some places, several adjoining houses have been bought,and the unified site redeveloped as a whole. Again, without a detailed survey, it isdifficult to estimate the further scope for this. Much will depend on the economicsof a particular scheme, and on the possibility of acquiring all the land needed todo a worth-while job. But as the supply of virgin land diminishes, builders will havean even greater incentive to turn to redevelopment. In recent years, applications for planning permission to carry out work of this kind in London have been running atthe rate of 30,000 dwellings annually, and about half of these have been approvedby the planning authorities.Sub-division of Dwellings6.30. In recent years, too, the number of separate dwellings has been increasedby the conversion of older, larger houses. This is a source, which, in the natureof things is bound to become exhausted as suitable properties are converted or are pulled down for redevelopment; but there should still be a substantial gainthrough this process during the period of the Study.General Redevelopment6.31. There is one other source of additional housing. Estimates derived froma survey carried out by local planning authorities in 1960 indicated that, in the short term, there might be a gain of about 25,000 dwellings consequential on generalredevelopment schemes, after allowance had been made for losses on slum clearanceredevelopment. For the future, the available evidence suggests that, while therewill be housing gains and losses in individual redevelopment schemes, these operations as a whole may not result in much net change in London&apos;s housingstocks in the period up to 1981. This is a provisional conclusion which will need tobe reviewed from time to time as more information becomes available.Other Sources of Housing Land6.32. Finally, there has been a continuing search for new sources of land for housing in London. This has met with some success. Valuable additions to thehousing stock can be expected from the development of Croydon Airport, theGovernment depots at Kidbrooke and Woolwich Arsenal; from the LondonCounty Councifs plans for Erith Marshes; and from the surplus land of theBritish Railways Board. No precise figures can be set against these, because insome instances, negotiations are still going on and there are other possibilitiestoo. But windfalls such as these do not represent a constant and reliable source of addition to London&apos;s housing stock, and will be harder to come by with thepassage of time.6.33. Moreover, there will be fortuitous losses as well as fortuitous gains. Itis inevitable that, over the 20-year period, there should be losses of houses and housing land for other essential uses new roads, road improvements, schools,technical colleges and many other purposes. The number cannot be estimated, but
In all the circumstances it would not be wise to assume for planning purposes that more than about 200,000 extra dwellings can be provided in the London conurbationitself over the period of the Study.Overspill from the London Conurbation6.35. This is the balance sheet for London over the Study period. Housingneed, 550,000 dwellings (150,000 to relieve existing shortages, 400,000 for population growth, including growth in the number of households). Housing capacity, about200,000. This means that 350,000 London families will need to find their homesoutside the conurbation; translated into terms of people, it means that London willhave an overspill of more than one million people by 1981.6.36. What this means is that the 200,000 extra houses which can be providedwould do little more than deal with present overcrowding. The equivalent of thewhole of the population growth of London will need to go out of the capital, either as commuters, returning to work there daily, or further afield. This rate of overspill one million in 20 years is in fact a little smaller than the rate experienced over thelast 10.6.37. This will leave London in 1981 with a population level little different from the present one just over 8 million for while a million people are movingout, natural increase will be adding another million. In fact, the figure is likely to fall a little over the next few years, and rise again, with the growing rate of natural increase, in the Seventies.6.38. The consequence for the rest of the South-East is that, since Londoncannot accommodate its own natural increase, the whole of the population growth of3\ million will have to be found homes elsewhere a population increase of well over a third for the area outside London.6.39. How an increase of this order can best be distributed forms the mainsubject of this Study. But, first, it is necessary to look at two special London problems the growth of employment, and commuting.CHAPTER 7.-LONDON EMPLOYMENT AND THE OFFICE PROBLEMEmployment Growth in London7.1. The total employment growth in London in recent years has beenlarge and the rate of growth has been accelerating. Over the seven years 1955-62the average annual increase in jobs in the London conurbation was 42.000; but forthe last three years for which figures are available (1959-62) the average increaseamounted to over 63,000. Over the seven-year period, nearly 300,000 extra jobs* See, for example, paragraph 40 of the London White Paper which estimated that about 150,000bouses would be required for replacement purposes. This included 40,000-50,000 for slum clearancewhere there should be little or no net loss in terms of land; but it covered only a ten-year period.it will certainly run into tens of thousands.* In these circumstances, it seems prude^fcto set off the uncertain gains against the uncertain losses to assume that enougfr&quot; windfall &quot; sites can be found to compensate for inevitable losses of housing land to other purposes.Extra Housing Capacity of London6.34.   On this basis, a very approximate measure of London&apos;s future housingcapacity is set out in the following table:Table IIIAdditional Housing CapacityLondon Conurbation, 1961-81HousesRemaining Vacant Land............      ... 30,000Private Redevelopment of Low Density Areas       ... 90,000Sub-division of Dwellings        ............ 45,000General Redevelopment............... 25,000Total ...............    190,000
Mere created in London, an increase of 6-6 per cent. This was close to the rateWf employment growth in England and Wales (6-8 per cent), but significantly below that for the South-East as a whole (10-1 per cent).Manufacturing Industry7.2. The pattern of employment growth in London has been very uneven, bothgeographically, and in the form of the additional employment provided. Growth in manufacturing industry, as might be expected in an area where Government policy has been to check and divert as much industrial growth as possible, has been slow.During the period 1955-58 there was actually a slight fall in the level of employmentin manufacturing industry, and the percentage increase between 1959 and 1962(2-1 per cent) was less than half of that experienced in England and Wales generally,and only a third of the rate for the South-East as a whole.7.3. These figures point to a relative decline in the importance of manufacturing industry in the economy of London. With growing congestion onthe roads and physical shortage of space for expansion, the future of Londonindustry lies more and more in the outer suburbs and in the ring around London particularly in the new towns and the towns housing the modern industries andthe new factories in the outer metropolitan region. It is in these places that much ofthe industrial growth restrained in London by controls, by labour shortage andby physical circumstances is taking place. During the period 1959-62, the numberof people employed in manufacturing industry in the outer metropolitan regionrose by 85,000, an increase of 14-6 per cent, nearly three times the national average.Service Employment7.4. In London itself, the big increases have been in service employment,including offices (see Appendix 2, Table 22). Over four-fifths of all the additionaljobs in recent years have been in service employment. Furthermore, more than halfof the total employment growth in the conurbation has been concentrated in thesmall central area. Two-thirds of this was in offices. In the congested heart ofLondon little more than the City and the West End 15,000 more office jobs havebeen created every year. Work in offices probably now makes up about 60 per cent of the total in the central area; in contrast, shops employ only about 4 per cent ofall workers in the same area.7.5. The problem is that more jobs mean more workers; and more workersmean more homes; and the possibilities of providing more homes in Londonitself and particularly in inner London are very limited. The growth of officeemployment is therefore particularly significant, both because of its size, and because of its concentration in the central area, where homes cannot be found, and where the transport services are becoming increasingly overloaded at peak hours.Office Growth7.6. Nearly 10 million square feet of office floor space in central London was lost through war damage, and some of what remained was in old-fashionedbuildings. For some years after the war, the construction industries were subjectto the building licensing system, and by the time these controls were relaxed in theearly &apos;fifties there was a pent up demand for offices in central London. The war had cleared many sites and, at first, planning permissions for office building werereadily forthcoming. Even when the consequences of extensive office building inthe small central area were realised, the planners&apos; freedom of action was severelylimited by compensation liabilities. Broadly speaking, the local planning authoritycould not, without risk of footing a heavy bill, refuse to allow an office block tobe built on sites where offices had stood before. Furthermore, because of anunforeseen effect of the law they had little choice but to allow developers to putmore floor space on a site than stood there before.* This applied not only to wardamaged sites. It soon became clear that it was worth while for a developer to pulldown standing offices many of which needed to be replaced anyway in order to gain this extra floor space for letting. This legislative loop-hole has now been stopped up.* The effects of the Third Schedule to the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, are explained in more detail in Appendix 2 of the London White Paper.CONFIDENTIAL3878 D
Future Prospects7.10. Whatever the economic necessity and value of this further growth,there can be no doubt of the magnitude of the housing and transport problems itwill present. How quickly will this growth come? What can be done to influence the rate of growth in the central area?7.11. The current rate of net increase has fallen from that of the peakyears 1955-59, in each of which there was a net increase of more than 4 million square feet; this is because most of the war-damaged sites have now been builton. It takes longer to clear a site of existing buildings and redevelop and, of course,not all of the floor space is net gain. But the rents being asked and obtained in central London offer no. evidence of slackening demand, and there is a possibility that the whole of the extra 25 million square feet may be built within a fewyears. This would add to the difficulty of finding homes and housing landfor the tens of thousands of extra commuters, to the cost of providing the transport to bring them in daily and to the congestion in the heart of London itself.7.12. It is becoming more and more apparent that the advantages of an office in central London are bought at high cost to the employer in terms of rent,rates, wages and fierce competition for staff, even though these do not representthe full social costs. There are signs of a growing awareness of this. Within a week* No other big city approaches these figures. For example, in 1962 Birmingham had about million square feet of offices in its central area; Liverpool, 6 million; and Manchester 7 million.7.7, The build up of offices in London has been supported by two long-terfjtrends. The first is the gradual shift of emphasis from making things to designingand marketing them. As growing mechanisation makes it possible for industryto produce more goods and more valuable goods with fewer workers, so morewhite-collar workers are needed in the drawing shop and in the managers office.A bigger selling organisation is required; advertising, for example, is one of thegrowth industries. The second is the tendency for industry to organise itself in larger units; when a certain point is reached, the chances are that the head office will be found in London, rather than in the provincial towns which saw the origin of the component parts of the organisation.7.8. Office building in London has been meeting an economic demand; and while it has been creating serious planning problems, it is well to recognise the sources of the demand. First, for many of those engaged in some kinds ofcommercial activity, there is value in a central London location. London isoustandingly important in the fields of banking, insurance and internationalcommerce and trade. For some firms, it is of value to be near Parliament andthe seat of Government, close to the Law Courts, the Port of London or theStock Exchange and to each other. For others, show-rooms and offices in Londongive an opening into the mass market of the South-East or into the internationalmarket. A City or West End address carries prestige for which a big concern isprepared to pay, and has to pay, heavily. The new offices in London are onereflection of economic development and growth.Amount of Office Growth7.9. What is troublesome is not just the amount of new office building but its concentration in a very restricted area. The war damage losses in the centralarea were quickly made up and by mid-1962 there was nearly 115 million square feet of office floor space in central London,* compared with the pre-war figureof 87 million square feet. This did not include another 18 million square feet whichwas at that time under construction, or had received planning permission(representing a net addition of perhaps 14 million square feet, allowing fordemolitions). Nor is that the end. There are still office sites ripe for redevelopmentwhere even the modified &quot; Third Schedule &quot; rights will allow some increase infloor space; and there are possibilities of some additional office building on sitesin commercial areas which cannot reasonably be put to other uses. In 1963 theLondon County Council estimated that they were committed to a net increase of25 million square feet of office floor space in the central area (including permissionsalready granted). At a generous estimate of 150 square feet of floor space peroffice worker this means an extra 170,000 office jobs still to come.
P&apos; opening its publicity campaign the Location of Offices Bureau had receivedover 100 enquiries from firms seeking information and advice aboutdecentralisation.7.13. For some firms a complete transfer of activities may be possible; butthere must be many more for whom the hiving off of routine work could representa saving of cost without loss of efficiency, leaving in the central area only those parts of their organisation for which the advantages of a London base outweigh the extra cost. Transfers of this kind are of real value, even if the vacated spaceis reoccupied by another firm, for the effect is to reduce the total demand forfloor space in the centre. If the policy of decentralisation is successful, it will slowdown and, coupled with the use of planning powers, perhaps eventually stop theprovision of additional offices in the central area.7.14. Until recently decentralisation was not easy, even for firms who could see the disadvantages and expense of remaining at the centre. One of the factors which nourished overgrowth in the central area was the absence of alternativesfor firms looking for new, modern offices. Massive development was going on inthe City and the West End and very little elsewhere. Now, many more planningpermissions are being sought and granted in the suburbs and further out, andmany planning authorities are making provision for offices in town centre schemes.7.15. It will greatly help to speed up the process if the development of newoffice centres is encouraged. These will need to be at varying distances from central London to meet the varying requirements of different firms. Proposals,which would need to be discussed with the local planning authorities, will be foundin Part II of this Study.7.16. The measures recently introduced by the Government are of a kind that need time to make their full effect felt. The restriction imposed by theamendment of the planning law, the campaign of persuasion by the Location of offices Bureau, the establishment of alternative first-class office centres on theperiphery and beyond, and the effect of congestion and costs on the decisions ofemployers to remain in Central London will all have a bearing on developments in the next few years. It may be that persuasion and the provision of alternativecentres will not, in themselves, be enough to offset what Central London has tooffer to employers. Two courses would then be open; either to slow down officegrowth by further restrictions, or to organise transport and housing on a scalecompatible with the growth in employment. Neither of these courses, unfortunately,presents a straightforward solution to this intractable problem.CHAPTER 8.-TRAVEL TO WORK IN LONDON8.1. In theory, commuting implies a deliberate choice by individuals of a daily journey to work in a city in order to have a home outside it. But for most people who work in Central London to-day, commuting is no longer a matter of choice; and, at its worst, can be one of the most wearing and unpleasant features of urban life.8.2. The history of the last half century shows a pattern of longer and longercommuting journeys, made practicable by transport improvements (notablyrailway electrification), which have cut travelling time. Higher wages, shorter hours and the five-day week have helped this trend; so have the wish for better living conditions and the desire to live in the country.8.3. It can be argued that commuting is a bad thing in itself; that it iswasteful of time and manpower; that it creates demands for transport which canonly be fully used at the morning and evening peaks; that it produces dormitorycommunities that form unsatisfactory societies; and that it is steadily eating upthe countryside around London. However much there may be in these socialarguments, the fact remains that the continued growth of employment in central london means not less travel to work but more.8.4. The crucial figures bear repeating. An average annual rate of increase injobs in the conurbation of 42,000 between 1955 and 1962, leaping to an average of63,000 in the last three years. In the central area, a growth of 15,000 office jobs ayear; probably about 20,000 when other forms of employment are allowed for.
The Present Scale of Commuting8.6. Anybody who works in London needs no figures to convince him thatthere has been an increase in commuting travel over the last decade. The evidence is there in the road congestion, in the crush on the Underground, and in theoverloading of some of the suburban rail services at peak hours.8.7. As well as an overall increase in commuting, there have been significantchanges in the proportions carried by different types of transport to the central area;and some changes in the future pattern are inevitable. In the last decade the loadcarried on the buses actually fell by 25 per cent while there was a sharp increase inthe share carried by British Railways and the Underground. These changes reflecta growing disinclination to use the buses as road congestion slowed up journeytimes; and, more important, a transfer to the forms of transport more suited tolonger journeys. The tendency for people to find their homes further out was alreadybecoming evident.8.8. The public service figures were also affected by a big upswing in the useof private vehicles. The volume of commuting by car and scooter doubled over the decade and without this, overcrowding on public transport would certainly havemade itself felt even more strongly. But even with this increase, private transportstill carries less than 10 per cent of all commuters. The limiting factors are the capacity of the roads to take more traffic in the rush hours, and the number of vehicles that can be parked in the centre of London. Parking policy is set againstthe commuter; it is becoming steadily more difficult and more expensive to leave a car in the central area all day. The introduction of parking meters in the City in1961 held traffic to the previous year&apos;s level; during the two years before, there hadbeen a rise of 11 per cent.8.9. The sharp increase in commuting by private vehicle over the last decadeis a phenomenon that is not likely to be repeated; public transport will have totake the lion&apos;s share of the big increases to come. The Buchanan Report emphasises the need to retain and improve public transport for the journey to work,particularly in large cities. It is clear that a solution to the overall transportproblems in London cannot be found through a further substantial increase incommuting by private vehicles.8.10. London Transports annual figures of people entering and leaving thecentral area by all forms of transport also reflect the growing rate of employmentincrease in London. The average annual rate of increase over the decade was13,000; but for the first five years it was only 7,000, rising to 20,000 in the last five.For the rail services, the figure was even higher 22,000 a year in the last five years because they have taken over some of the traffic lost by the buses.8.11. Thus there is a close relationship between the volume of commutingtraffic and the additional employment created in the central area. Indeed, it seems likely that the growth in traffic on the longer-range public services (rail andunderground) is a little higher than the rate of employment growth. This discrepancy-is probably due to the steady movement of white-collar workers to homes outsidethe conurbation.8.5. At the same time, the resident population of the conurbation has beeWfalling. Many of those who have gone have taken up fresh work in new townsand other places, and some will have retired; but it is thought that, in recent years,about 7,000 families a year have been moving into the ring around London wherelarge-scale private enterprise building has made it possible for the City workerto have a country or suburban home while keeping his job in London. This means that more travel to work is generated than the increase in employment by itself would require. This tendency will continue; although it is hoped that, by 1981 thepopulation of the conurbation will be back at its present level, for some years at least the steady outward movement of London white collar workers with their families, will continue. In the &apos;fifties, some part of this outward movement wasabsorbed in the outer parts of the conurbation itself, but with the virtualdisappearance of virgin building land, there will be less scope for this in the future.Even more of the burden will fall on the outer metropolitan region and the longer-range transport services.
(jjj^he Future of Commuting8.12. It is employment growth in the central area that sets the criticaltransport problems. Given that most of the net increase in the housing stock forLondoners has to be found outside the boundaries of the conurbation, most ofthe extra central area workers will have no choice but to come in to one of themain line termini on the suburban rail system. At this kind of range, the busescannot help, and the scope for more commuting by private vehicle is limited. the underground will have an important part to play, but one of its main functions,together with the buses, will be to provide an efficient distribution service in thecentre. The main weight of the extra commuting to the central area must fall onthe suburban railways. Employment growth in the outer parts of the conurbationwill produce a more complex transport pattern. Here too some extra load on therailways is inevitable; but there will be more scope for short-range journeys bybus and car, and rail passengers to places in the outer suburbs will leave vacantplaces on the vital last few miles where overcrowding is usually at its worst.8.13. For the future, there is likely to be a steadily increasing commutertraffic for the railways. They will have to carry workers for the new jobs created in the central area; and workers at present living and working in London who will,while keeping their jobs, go to live in the outer metropolitan region (commuteroverspill, in planners&apos; jargon). The current rate of increase in the central area isabout 20,000 new jobs a year; also there are enough new offices in the pipeline tokeep this rate going (allowing for increases in other employment) for several years ahead. The rate of increase will depend on the success of the measures being taken toget a better spread of office growth, but it will take time before their full effect is felt.Some of those moving out of London to live (average rate 7,000 workers a year)will have jobs outside the central area, and will to this extent reduce the potentialburden on the railways. On the other hand, there will be new jobs outside thecentral area, but near enough to the main line termini to make rail the mostattractive method of travelling to work.8.14. Any prediction of the future commuting rate is hazardous. But, onthese figures, and bearing in mind the current rate of increase, it seems unlikelythat the increasing load could come to less than an annual average of 20,000 inthe period up to 1971. This means that we must expect 200,000 more commuters,over and above the number travelling to central London in 1961; though not all of them will travel at the most congested hours. There may well be further heavy demands after 1971. But the pattern of transport needs after that date will dependvery much on the success enjoyed by the policy of office decentralisation.The Problems of More Capacity8.15. It is therefore a question of getting more trains, or trains with morecapacity, into the centre at the right time to provide for at least another 200,000people to travel into central London in 1971 over and above the number travellingin 1961; with a probable need for more in later years. There is some spare capacityon some services, and more will be provided by the rail improvement schemes already planned. But both the amount and the distribution of the extra capacityraises problems. One of the most important is the matching of housing land withrail capacity; it is no use having room in the trains if the houses cannot be builton the routes they serve.8.16. Extra capacity can be provided in various ways. In some placesimprovements to the present system and reshaping of services, without extensivework on the tracks, can allow more passengers to be carried. For instance, new,higher capacity, coaches can replace the existing ones; trains and platforms canbe lengthened; and new signalling systems can be introduced which allow moretrains to use the existing track. When everything possible has been done in thisway, the carrying capacity of the railways is controlled by the physical limitations of the tracks available. At this point, more expensive improvements come in the picture. There are the limitations imposed by particular bottlenecks: by the capacity of a terminus or of a big junction. All these measures are expensive andmay not be remunerative on particular services.Additional Capacity and its Distribution8.17. The possibilities of providing additional capacity for commuters havebeen explored with British Railways and London Transport. As was noted in theLondon White Paper, the pattern of spare capacity on the railways at the moment
f P&apos;he Future of Commuting8.12. It is employment growth in the central area that sets the criticaltransport problems. Given that most of the net increase in the housing stock forLondoners has to be found outside the boundaries of the conurbation, most ofthe extra central area workers will have no choice but to come in to one of themain line termini on the suburban rail system. At this kind of range, the busescannot help, and the scope for more commuting by private vehicle is limited. the underground will have an important part to play, but one of its main functions,together with the buses, will be to provide an efficient distribution service in thecentre. The main weight of the extra commuting to the central area must fall onthe suburban railways. Employment growth in the outer parts of the conurbationwill produce a more complex transport pattern. Here too some extra load on therailways is inevitable; but there will be more scope for short-range journeys bybus and car, and rail passengers to places in the outer suburbs will leave vacantplaces on the vital last few miles where overcrowding is usually at its worst.8.13. For the future, there is likely to be a steadily increasing commutertraffic for the railways. They will have to carry workers for the new jobs created in the central area; and workers at present living and working in London who will,while keeping their jobs, go to live in the outer metropolitan region (commuteroverspill, in planners&apos; jargon). The current rate of increase in the central area isabout 20,000 new jobs a year; also there are enough new offices in the pipeline tokeep this rate going (allowing for increases in other employment) for several years ahead. The rate of increase will depend on the success of the measures being taken toget a better spread of office growth, but it will take time before their full effect is felt.Some of those moving out of London to live (average rate 7,000 workers a year)will have jobs outside the central area, and will to this extent reduce the potentialburden on the railways. On the other hand, there will be new jobs outside thecentral area, but near enough to the main line termini to make rail the mostattractive method of travelling to work.8.14. Any prediction of the future commuting rate is hazardous. But, onthese figures, and bearing in mind the current rate of increase, it seems unlikelythat the increasing load could come to less than an annual average of 20,000 inthe period up to 1971. This means that we must expect 200,000 more commuters,over and above the number travelling to central London in 1961; though not all of them will travel at the most congested hours. There may well be further heavy demands after 1971. But the pattern of transport needs after that date will dependvery much on the success enjoyed by the policy of office decentralisation.The Problems of More Capacity8.15. It is therefore a question of getting more trains, or trains with morecapacity, into the centre at the right time to provide for at least another 200,000people to travel into central London in 1971 over and above the number travellingin 1961; with a probable need for more in later years. There is some spare capacityon some services, and more will be provided by the rail improvement schemes already planned. But both the amount and the distribution of the extra capacityraises problems. One of the most important is the matching of housing land withrail capacity; it is no use having room in the trains if the houses cannot be builton the routes they serve.8.16. Extra capacity can be provided in various ways. In some placesimprovements to the present system and reshaping of services, without extensivework on the tracks, can allow more passengers to be carried. For instance, new,higher capacity, coaches can replace the existing ones; trains and platforms canbe lengthened; and new signalling systems can be introduced which allow moretrains to use the existing track. When everything possible has been done in thisway, the carrying capacity of the railways is controlled by the physical limitations of the tracks available. At this point, more expensive improvements come in the picture. There are the limitations imposed by particular bottlenecks: by the capacity of a terminus or of a big junction. All these measures are expensive andmay not be remunerative on particular services.Additional Capacity and its Distribution8.17. The possibilities of providing additional capacity for commuters havebeen explored with British Railways and London Transport. As was noted in theLondon White Paper, the pattern of spare capacity on the railways at the moment
is uneven. There is comparatively little capacity on the services for longer distancefcommuters south of the river; to the north the peak hour services can absorb aconsiderable increase.8.18. Moreover, there is scope for further increases of capacity north of theriver. Necessary measures to renew rolling stock and equipment are alreadyproviding an opportunity to re-schedule services and increase train loadings here.South of the river, where re-equipment since the war has already added to the capacity of the services, further physical works to increase capacity with presentservice patterns would have to be of a major kind. They would involve large-scale and very costly investment which could almost certainly not be justified by therevenue potential of the extra peak-hour passengers that could be carried.8.19. This uneven distribution of spare capacity already existing or likely to beprovided raises problems of finding housing land. There would be little point inalocating more land in some sectors south of the river; in the counties north ofthe Thames, which have experienced heavy population increases in the last 10 yearsand where the land situation is already difficult there would be a need to find morehousing land, and to find it quickly.8.20. British Railways have, however, been re-examining the present pattern of services, particularly south of the river, to see whether a complete reshaping ofthe pattern of train movement would result in more efficient utilisation ofexisting track, and thus provide additional capacity. A great deal more workremains to be done before a detailed appreciation of potential capacity can beestablished. It already seems clear, however, that, given the necessary capital investment, the services south of the river might be able to cater physically foran increase of some 200,000 passengers in the peak hour of 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. alone.For the London area as a whole, it seems possible that the combination of modernisation where it is reasonably practicable, and general reshaping of the pattern of train movement, would allow the British Railways network to cater for another 450,000 peak hour commuters, enough to meet the demands for manyyears to come.8.21. An increase in capacity of this order, particularly on the complicatednetwork of the Southern Region, would mean a very considerable change inthe pattern of services. While the details have not yet been worked out it is clear thatthe provision of more fast trains for longer distance commuters would meansubstantial alterations in the services provided for other travellers, especially thoseliving nearer in. It might be necessary to eliminate some stopping services, perhap seven to close certain inner suburban stations on the critical approaches to theLondon termini, and to reduce the choice of London termini available to passengerson particular routes.8.22. If more commuters are brought in by rail, London Transport will face the problem of distributing them from the railway termini to their places of work.A reshaping of railway services on the lines now being studied by British railways would entail greater interchange between trains and perhaps a greater reliance onthe Underground network for distribution in this inner area. London transport are studying what development would be needed on their services. In their view,additions to the Underground network would be required in addition to the victoria Line which is already under construction.Cost of Improvements8.23. The cost of extra rolling stock, platform lengthening, signalling and other necessary measures to provide expansions of the order mentioned above would be heavy. British Railways estimate the order of cost to them at some  100 million, ofwhich some  30 million would be needed on the Southern Region. The capital costto London Transport might be even heavier.8.24. There are difficult questions of timing. Some spare rail capacity isalready available on lines serving the counties to the north of London, and british railways have made good progress with the planning of schemes of improvementof services in this area: but it may not be easy to allocate enough housing land for additional commuters in these counties. The position on housing land would bemade easier if additional capacity could be provided in other sectors; but,even allowing for the relief provided by the Victoria Line, congestion in the centralarea would be worsened if large numbers of extra commuters were brought in,particularly from the south, before London Transport were able to carry them from the main line stations to their work. This may prove to be a limiting factor.
f 8.25. The effect of all this on the finances of British Railways and of london transport needs to be examined before schemes of this kind could be entered into.For example, the cost of the Victoria Line will have to be met by users of theLondon Transport system as a whole. Whether further extensions of the underground system could be paid for in this way is a question that will requireseparate examination. A similar point arises in connection with the suburbanservices of British Railways.Land Allocations8.26. The next important step is to see to it that housing land is allocated inthose areas where the railways are able to provide capacity, and, in particular, inthose sectors where there is spare capacity or will be soon. This is a matter for detailed discussions with the local planning authorities; but the possible pattern of rail development in the future, as it now appears, has been taken intoconsideration in preparing the estimates of population growth for the counties in chapter 15.CHAPTER 9-SUMMARY OF THE PROBLEM9.1. These, then, are the problems the South-East has to face over the next20 years or so:A strong population increase.3^ million extra people, representing a growth of 20 per cent,over two-thirds of that increase coming from excess of birthsover deaths in the South-East.A strong employment growth.Much of this in service employment, especially, in the early years,in offices in London.Much of the industrial growth not in London itself, but in the ringsurrounding the capital.A big overspill problem-at least a million people from London.An acute land problem around London, where converging populationpressures meet the green belt.9.2. The problem is not merely one of the scale of growth that has to beexpected; equally important is the distribution of the growth. If present trends are left unaltered, the greater part of the population and employment increase will be concentrated in what is already the most densely populated, over-developed andcongested part of the South-East in London itself and in the outer metropolitan region.9.3. Whatever may be done in the South-East as a whole, the land problemof the ring around London will be the most difficult to solve. The whole of themetropolitan region has become so urbanised that the establishment of the greenbelt was a vital planning necessity and so is its retention now. But it was established on the assumption of a broadly static population and employment situation. Thedifficulty is to reconcile the concept of a completely restrictive green belt with avigorously growing population and a vigorously growing economy inside it and around it.9.4. There are three main approaches to these problems; they arecomplementary.9.5. The first is to ensure that everything possible is done to encourage growthoutside the South-East so that there is a more even spread of development over thecountry as a whole. The measures needed for this are receiving separate study,and the assumption is made that where necessary they will be taken and will be successful in their effect.9.6. The second is to ensure that no employment growth whether industrialor commercial takes place in the South-East which could be diverted to other partsof the country. This is a matter of continuing and, where possible, strengthening,existing policies.9.7. The third is to get the best possible distribution in the South-East of thepopulation growth that seems inevitable. This raises big questions of land use overthe region as a whole; and it is with these questions that Part II of the Study is mainly concerned.
0No Plan at all?10.2. The alternative to a plan deserves consideration, for there are plausiblearguments for doing nothing. If there were no positive efforts to guide themovement of population, and to control the growth of employment, london would become an even stronger and an even larger magnet than it is to-day. Evenmore offices would be built in the central area, calling for more housing and moretransport for the workers in them. A phenomenal rate of growth could be expected in the ring immediately surrounding London, which is already experiencing thefastest rate of population and employment growth in the whole country. Thisouter ring will in any event have to find land to house its own strong natural increase, for migrants drawn in by its own young and expanding industries, andfor London workers who cannot find homes in the capital.10.3. It is sometimes argued that the situation would be self-correcting; thatin such circumstances the cost of housing and travel would rise to such an extent that this would have to be reflected in wage increases; and that these wage increases in turn would damp down the demand for labour, which would becomeprogressively harder to get.10.4. Such a prospect would be intolerable, inefficient and expensive. In so faras homes for the extra population drawn to the London orbit had to be found onthe periphery, there would need to be very large cuts in the green belt. whatever may be the arguments against retaining the green belt in its present form, a continuous urban sprawl of this character would pose enormous problems of communications. It would not simply be a question of adding substantially to thecost of improving the suburban rail services; the road problems arising out of thisgrowth, when multiplied by the increase in traffic that has to be faced, would beenormous. One lesson of the Buchanan Report is that, as the continuous built-up area becomes larger, so does the traffic problem become more difficult and more expensive to solve.The Overspill Approach10.5. The practical arguments against allowing the growth of the South-east to spread where it will, or even encouraging more concentration in London, arevery strong; but simply to reject these philosophies does not produce a new one.Before the war, the growth manifested itself as a simple outv/ard sprawl from london. The revulsion against this produced the green belt and the first new towns. Great benefits have flowed from this double conception of containmentcoupled with planned overspill. Hundreds of square miles of countryside aroundLondon have been saved; and scores of thousands of London families have beengiven new homes in a better environment. If the problem were static, or one of only moderate growth, this would have been enough. London could remain muchas it is, and the new towns would provide the elbow room needed to get rid ofovercrowding in the capital. But London is not static.10.6. The present conception of new towns and town expansion schemes asreceptacles for London overspill is not adequate to deal with this situation. they receive the overflow; but do nothing to turn off the tap. If we go on as we are perhaps stepping up the programme a little to receive more overspill little will bedone to change the nature of the problem. London will continue to be the mostattractive centre in the whole of the South-East, and in the whole of the country.PART II.-PROPOSALSCHAPTER 10.-THE BROAD STRATEGY10.1. Over the next 20 years, land has got to be found for 3 - million people,and for a million of these, at least, it will mean moving out of London. Populationchange on this scale will make a heavy impact on the South-East; and the need is to plan it so that the result is better distribution of people and jobs and nothousing and land shortage, congestion and sprawl over the countryside.
P 10.7. More employment growth in London is likely. The consequences of thatgrowth must be planned for in and around London. But a big change in theeconomic balance within the South-East is needed to moderate the dominance ofLondon and to get a more even distribution of the growth. Employment is the key, but many firms are unwilling to go to places which they regard as unsuitable for the conduct of their business.Growth away from London10.8. What is needed is the creation of conditions in which expansion can take place well clear of London. One important need is to draw growth andparticularly commercial growth away from London. The places where this is done will, among other things, help to absorb London&apos;s overspill. But theirfunction would be wider than that of the existing new and expanded towns. Theyshould take a large part of the burden of growth in the South-East and so ease the intensity of the pressure on London and the outer metropolitan region. As centres of commerce and industry, they could make a large contribution to nationalprosperity and rising standards of living. They would generate new growth, someof which can be hived off to strengthen the economies of other regions. The biggestof them would rank as cities of the future.10.9. From the point of view of employers, these should be places whoseadvantages are comparable with those of London, and where business is likely toflourish. For people who must leave London and for migrants coming into theSouth-East, these places should offer the prospect of a good job, pleasantsurroundings and a better life than could be expected in the crowded capital.10.10. To be effective these centres would have to be large and strong.Obviously it would take time before their influence is felt. But they offer the best chance of dealing with London&apos;s continual growth.Normal Growth, in the South-East10.11. All this implies a policy of planned schemes of expansion to providejobs and homes. But a large part of the population growth in the South-East willnot have to be dealt with in this fashion. For the greater part of the population growth, the ordinary planning machinery can function satisfactorily, as long asthe planning authorities are given warning in time of the size of the populationincreases to be dealt with in their land budget. Allocations of housing land canthen be made by them, for the most part in the form of the normal growth of townsand villages, and, as will be seen, this is the manner in which the greater part ofthe growth expected in the South-East is likely to be dealt with.10.12. The largest single element to be provided for in this way is thenatural increase of the local population. Every county in the South-East willhave its share of this. In Chapter 15, estimates of natural increase, county by county,are given which will help them to make the necessary allocations. The planning authority itself will know best how to distribute this increase within its area, havingregard to the local pattern of population movement and physical limitations. Theseare not the concern of this Study for they are local, rather than regional problems,although they will present their own difficulties in some places.10.13. Local allocations in development plans will have to be stepped up tomeet two particular needs. The first is migration for retirement. This will affect onlya few counties, and there is no reason to expect the-pattern of the past to change.Much of this type of migration has been concentrated on seaside towns, and its effect on the population structure of these places has been to alter the balance of births and deaths to a marked degree. Some seaside towns in fact, can expect a fall in population by natural change, rather than increase.10.14. The other big requirement will fall primarily on the planning authoritiesin the outer metropolitan region. This is to provide housing land for the workers who cannot find homes in the conurbation itself. Some of these will be people movingprivately out of London; others will be migrants drawn directly into the outer metropolitan region by the employment opportunities offered by London.Allocations of land for this purpose should be aligned with railway capacity (see chapter 8), and the extent of the provision that needs to be made is discussed later(Chapter 15).

Planned Expansion Programme v.10.15. But the normal development plan allocations of the local planning authorities will not deal with two important components in the population increase:these are a large part of the overspill from London and migrants for work.10.16. Under existing policies, planned expansions i.e., new towns and town expansion schemes would expect most of their intake to be overspill from london. But leaving migrants out of the reckoning merely assumes a continuation of the currents which draw people to London and draw them away again asoverspill. There are bound to be migrants; but if some of them can be broughtinto expansion schemes, they can be diverted from London altogether.10.17. It was estimated in Chapter 6 that there would be an overspill ofmore than a million people by 1981. It is difficult to say what proportion of these will make their own arrangements to move out many of them as commuters. Inthe short and medium term, it is not likely that there will be any great change from the current rate of movement of this kind, namely, about 7,000 households,or roughly 20,000 persons a year. There is still growth to come in London whichwill hold workers within commuting range. In the long run, the diversion ofemployment to new centres of expansion should reduce the flow; but their effect is unlikely to be strongly felt until the Seventies. For the moment, there is nosolid reason for assuming any radical change in the rate, and, on this basis, outof the million overspill about 400,000 would move under their own arrangements.- 10.18. In broad terms, therefore, and allowing for the fact that the calculation of one million overspill is probably an under-estimate, this would leaveat least 600,000 overspill from London to be provided for in planned expansion schemes during the period 1961-81.10.19. To these must be added migrants for work well over three-quarters of a million. This would give nearly 1% million as the total population to be accomodated in planned expansion schemes. But of these, over a quarter of amillion will be able to go into the existing new towns or into town expansionswhich are already under way or firmly planned (this figure does not allow for anyfurther expansion. of new towns beyond their present designated areas). new schemes, and extensions of existing ones, would therefore be needed to accommodate nearly 11 million people.10.20. It is not suggested that this should be taken as a firm target, and thatschemes should be put in hand to absorb that number. Many of the figures going into the calculation are tentative; trends may well be modified; and important new light may be thrown on the pattern of population growth before a lot ofmoney is spent on any scheme. There have been surprises in the past aboutpopulation changes, and there may be others in the future.10.21. Rather is it suggested that a broad figure of 1 million to H millionprovides a reasonable basis for considering the scale of operations that needs to be attempted, and can act as a guide in the preliminary sifting of placesthat offer prospects for expansion. The idea would be, after consultation with thelocal authorities concerned, to produce a list of schemes approximating to this total, and to put schemes in hand, and vary the pace of building, as needs are confirmed. Individual schemes would continue after 1981.10.22. Nor is it desirable, at this stage, to try to label too firmly the people who will come to live in these places, for the movements of population whichtake place are very complex. The main point is that there should be a coherentprogramme of planned growth, well away from London, broadly on this scale.CHAPTER 11.-PLANNED EXPANSION SCHEMES11.1. The planned schemes of expansion would have two main objectives: toget population and employment away from London, and to supplement thenormal land allocations of the local planning authorities by providing for about one-third of all the population growth expected in the South-East by 1981 (roughlvli million people).
W 112. For this, there is no need to stick rigidly to the artificial boundary ofthe Study area. As well as choice of places, there should be a choice of methods and machinery new towns, expansions of existing towns: starting new schemes and building up on ones already under way. There are the alternatives of a few bigdevelopments or a lot of small ones.11.3. In practice, the choice is sharply narrowed. It is not a question of dottingnew towns here and there on a blank map; much of the South-East is intensivelydeveloped and, even more important, it will have to accommodate a great deal of natural growth as well as these expansion schemes. It is essential to try to evenout the distribution of the growth, as far as the facts will allow.General Strategy11.4. Above all, the schemes must be successful. This sounds obvious, but itneeds to be said. If the new centres are to exert a genuine pull on London andare going to provide homes for over a million people by 1981, they cannot be chosen by negative criteria. This means places should be chosen for expansionwhich will have a firm prospect of rapid, sound and prosperous growth, and above all, the ability to attract commerce and offices from London. It is no use choosingplaces simply because they need rehabilitating or rejuvenating; or because there isdereliction to be cleared; or because the land is poor. That is not to say, on theother hand, that places which need it should not be brought up to date, or thatbad farmland should not be built on in preference to good, where there is a choice.Size11.5. The first and dominating factor then is a reasonable chance of success.The second is size, and the two things are closely linked.11.6. Practical limitations are very important here. The number of places where there is room for a big new town is small; the number of places where such a town could be expected to prosper is even smaller. There may also be some limitations on the speed at which any particular scheme can go. Theexperience of the current new towns suggests that it is difficult to sustain a buildingrate of more than about 1,500 houses a year. There are some indications thatbeyond this they might run into trouble. This is not just a question of buildingcapacity although availability of labour is important; indeed, an ambitious new scheme, providing a large site for operations, might give industrialised buildingtechniques the opportunity to build houses faster than ever before in this country.The difficulties have lain more in planning a properly balanced programme of investment for growth on such a rapid scale. In theory, it should be easy; butin practice, things may get out of hand. Housing must keep in balance with jobsand the rate of industrial and commercial development may restrain theprogramme of housebuilding. Moreover there are social difficulties. A rapidbuild-up produces an unbalanced structure, with too many families of the sameage and background leading to a series of bulges that may take several generationsto even out.11.7. There is clearly no absolute limitation here. Improved managementtechniques may overcome many of these difficulties and where a big expansionscheme is based on a large existing town, this will provide the ballast of an existing, stable community. But there is clearly some limit to the pace of growth in any one scheme, and this, combined with the fact that it will take several years to get a big expansion planned and under way, means that homes for 1  million people cannot be provided by 1981 in a handful of very big schemes alone. Thisis a point of general application; it is not possible to define a single &quot; optimum &quot;form of solution (whether chosen by financial, economic or social criteria) and concentrate on that. Given the magnitude of the task, and the physical fact as they are, a variety of methods need to be used.11.8. Subject to this general reservation, big schemes are better than smallones. Large schemes have all the advantages when it comes to providing employment. Small expansions do not readily attract big firms; and the small oneswhich go to them are at best unlikely to grow fast in aggregate. Only a big towncan provide enough school-leavers to meet the recruitment needs of office firms.The bigger the town the more chance there is of finding local industrial or commercial employment that could grow, given the necessary freedom and the stimulus of an expansion scheme.
Communications in the South-East11.16. The whole of the South-East benefits from the key position of london in the national communications network (see Fig. 18). The roads and the main railway lines radiate from the capital on their way to the Channel ports; to wales and the West Country; to the Midlands and Lancashire; to Yorkshire, theNorth-East and Scotland. In doing so, they pass through practically every part ofthe South-East; and only East Anglia is less well served.11.9. There are other advantages. Generally speaking, the cost per headproviding basic services should fall with increasing size. And only bigger towns say 100,000 plus can support a first-class shopping centre, a full range of urbanservices, a complete educational system and a variety of entertainments; these things are necessary, not only in their own right, but also because they influence the decisions of employers.11.10. There is also the question of administrative and technical effort. Alot of small schemes are an extravagant way of using the very limited numbersof skilled staff who are qualified to plan operations of this kind. With the exceptionof one or two of the larger schemes the current town expansion programme has produced results, in terms of quantity, that do not adequately reward the effortthat has been put in by central Government and by local authorities at the sendingand receiving ends. The availability of qualified staff may well prove to be a biglimiting factor on the execution of the whole Study and it is essential that theirskill should be concentrated where it will produce most results.11.11. On the other hand, there must be some upper limit beyond which it isnot realistic to plan. Limits may be set by the physical capacity of the chosen sie and, over any given period of time, by the rate of growth that can be.achieved.Nobody can know what is to be the final size of any new town started over thenext few years; but the initial target should be large, so that something worth whileis produced. At the most promising sites allowance should be made in the initialplans for further long-term growth up to the scale of a major city.11.12. Rather different considerations arise with expansion of a large existingtown. Physical limitations may be much more important, and cost per head ofadditional population may change sharply as the scheme passes points at whichmajor additions to the public services become necessary. The stage at whicha big reconstruction of the town centre becomes necessary will also be critical.In this context the traffic needs are crucial.11.13. To sum up, the advantages lie with large schemes; but it is impossibleto put the whole expansion programme into, say, two or three new towns of half a million each. They would not produce nearly enough houses in time. Equally,a pepper-potting of small schemes is undesirable. It would be unworkableadministratively; and would not produce the strong concentrations needed to pullgrowth from London.11.14. So what is wanted (which is conditioned by what can be done) is a balanced programme with a few really big schemes and a number of large tomedium sized expansions also. Some should be new towns and some expandedtowns, because the two methods are to some extent complementary. New townsare a straightforward and well-tried method, particularly suited to settlement of population and industry within a limited period of years. But for some years theydo not provide the pool of labour for office work; and this should be looked forinitially in well-established large towns.Choice of Location11.15. The areas chosen for growth should lie in places where both industryand commerce can be expected to thrive and communications are a vital factor.Any employer will seek first-class links with London and other large markets and centres of industry. There must be easy access to the heads of internationalcommunication the ports and the airports. Primary importance attaches to roadcommunications, for experience in the new towns shows that these are whatemployers look for first. But rail may have a bigger part to play if the new formsof goods services now being developed prove to be attractive.
P 11.17. For rail, London is the centre of the national system (see Figs. 19 and20). Whatever difficulties there may be in finding enough places for the daily tide ofcommuters into the capital, there will be no shortage of medium and long-rangecapacity to serve London and the towns in the South-East lying on or near themain lines. It is true that some services and the rail network itself may be cutback; but if the cuts fall on commercially unprofitable lines or services, theprosperous and busy parts of the South-East are unlikely to suffer. The proposals in the Beeching Report* are unlikely to have more than a minimal effect on theexpansion programme suggested in this Study.11.18. In the present climate, it is not realistic to expect major new railwaydevelopments that might alter the pattern of growth in the South-East. an exception to this would, however, be the construction of a fixed Channel link, ifthis is decided upon.11.19. As with the railway system, the road network radiating from Londonlends strength to the whole of the South-East. There are over 1,500 miles of trunk road in the Study area. Since 1955, nearly 80 miles have been completelyreconstructed or been improved and 50 schemes, each costing over  100,000 havebeen carried through. 70 more schemes are planned and should be authorised overthe next five years some have already started and these will improve 116 moremiles of trunk road. These are concentrated on the most heavily used radial roadsfrom London, such as the Al (Great North Road), A3 (Portsmouth), Al2 (Ipswich)and A40 (Oxford and South Wales).11.20. Nearly 100 miles of motorway have been provided in the South-East,comprising part of the London-Birmingham motorway, the Medway motor road,by-passes at Maidstone and Stevenage, and sections of the London-South Walesmotorway (M4) at Slough and Maidenhead. In addition, a 13-mile length of theM4 is under construction between Chiswick and Langley and planning for the restof this motorway is well advanced. New motorways are planned from London toCrawley, to Basingstoke and to Bishop&apos;s Stortford, and more by-passes to motorwaystandard will be built.11.21. In selecting places for growth, these improvements in roadcommunications will be of the first importance. The Bishop&apos;s Stortford motorwayand the improvements to the A12 will give the south-eastern corner of East Angliamuch better access to London; while the South Wales motorway will bring addedeconomic strength to areas west of London, giving them easy and rapidcommunications with the port of Bristol, as well as with London and the coalfieldsand industries of South Wales.11.22. These are the prospects offered by present road plans; but in producing an overall pattern of future growth in the South-East it is necessaryto look further ahead still. The national motorway system, which will total1,000 miles by the early 1970s, is designed to provide the basic network for themain flows of long-distance commercial and industrial traffic in the country. Theroad programme is also planned to relieve and gradually renew existing mainroads where they are heavily overloaded. Traffic densities on trunk roads in theSouth-East are shown in Fig. 21.11.23. Since the war, it has so far been essential to deal first with those mainroutes which carry the greatest volume of industrial and commercial traffic onwhich the economy depends. But, since these main routes must serve the presentpattern of urban and industrial development, concentration on them inevitablytends to perpetuate that pattern. As the basic motorway network nears completion,and planning of another generation of new roads gets under way, it will bepossible, to an increasing extent, to shape new road plans to match future needs,for example, new proposals for major changes in the distribution of population and employment. A sense of proportion is needed in this; there is no case for building many miles of motorway for the sake of a remote new town. A single newtown even a big one would not produce the traffic that would justify all thedead mileage; nor, on the other hand, would the construction of a motorway temptemployers to go to a new town which had no other raison d&apos;etre.Roads*The Reshaping of British Railways: H.M.S.O., price  1.
11.24. What can be done, however, is to try to determine where likely futurKdevelopments in the South-East will make the case for better roads outside theorbit of London; and further, to consider how these new, or greatly improved,roads will intersect the London radial system to produce new focal points. Placessuch as these could be the most promising of all locations for the big newexpansions needed, for they will provide new opportunities for growth.11.25. One example of this can be seen from the developing need for bettercommunications between Southampton and the Midlands. If expansion takes placeon the scale suggested later in this Study at Southampton, and this is linked withthe development of Southampton as a port, there will be a growing volume oftraffic that will call for something much better than the existing road links, andpossibly something on the scale of a motorway. An improved link with theMidlands would intersect the London-South Wales motorway, and would produce a major cross-road in the Newbury-Hungerford area, which would be a naturalgrowing point.Ports and Airports11.26. Ease of access to ports and airports is obviously a factor of first importance when it comes to selecting growth points and Fig. 22 shows the broaddistribution of traffic in 1961. With ports, London and Southampton stand out,though the presence of Bristol will add to the attraction of growing points to thewest of London, especially when the South Wales motorway is built. This patternis not likely to change much; although there may be scope for some developmentelsewhere. Major port development in the South-East is bound to be concentrated on the Thames and Southampton.11.27. London has the country&apos;s main airport at Heathrow. Gatwicksupplements Heathrow by handling short-haul and medium-haul services in thesouthern sector. The combined capacity of these two airports will be too small inthe Seventies and a third London airport will be needed. This may be established at Stansted, in Essex. This is close to the line of the Bishop&apos;s Stortford motorway,and the two together would provide a powerful stimulus for development in this area. Local airports offering a direct passenger and freight service to the continentcan also be of great value to commercial employers or manufacturers willing toleave London. Southend, whose airport offers quick and easy journeys to belgium and Holland in particular, is very well equipped in this respect.Distance from London11.28. There is one other general consideration governing the choice of places for expansion. This is the paramount need to channel as much growth as possiblewell away from London right outside the South-East, where this can be done.Even within the South-East, distance from London is an important consideration.There are many attractive places in the outer metropolitan region, with excellentcommunications, a fine industrial record, and the ability to attract commercialemployment. But this is an area with planning problems arising from the growththat is already built in by reason of its population structure and the strength ofits economy.11.29. It is the outer metropolitan region which has taken the brunt of the planning policies deriving from Abercrombie. It contains all the first generation of London new towns, with their young and fertile population, and their new andflourishing industries. It contains many of the first generation of town expansion schemes, too. It has found homes for the London &quot; commuter overspill&quot; for whom there was no room in the conurbation, and it will have to find homes for many more,as well as for others drawn towards London by the new jobs created there, but whonever find a place to live in the capital at all. At the same time, the metropolitangreen belt has been established, and big extensions to it planned, thus reducing theamount of land available for development.11.30. In the last decade, the outer metropolitan region experienced a population growth of almost a million an increase of 30 per cent. No other partof the country approached this rate of change; and the assimilation of growth onthis scale imposes a real strain on local services. Over the period of the Study, the outer metropolitan area is likely to gain over 850,000 by natural increase alone,without allowing for movement into the area from London and elsewhere.
f 11.31. In these circumstances, there are strong arguments for keeping furtherplanned expansion schemes out of this area. In practice, this will not be possible,because it will be necessary to look to a handful of places in the outer metropolitan region if enough viable schemes are to be got going. But it may be possible to confine these to the outer part of the area.CHAPTER 12.-PLANNED EXPANSION-THE LOCAL FACTORS12.1. So far, only broad strategic considerations in the selection of places for expansion have been discussed. When it comes down to places, a great deal morehas to be looked at.New Towns12.2. In some ways, it is easier to set out the requirements for a good newtown site than for a town expansion. It goes without saying that the prerequisitesmust be met first-class communications, or the prospect of them, and reasonabledistance from London or other major centres of population. The site has to be physically suitable for development; the contours should not be too severe, andthe land should not be liable to flooding. Good agricultural land has to be avoidedas far as possible. It must be possible to supply enough water to meet the needsof the town, including its industries, and there must be adequate means of disposing of the sewage effluent.12.3. For a large new town of the type contemplated in this Study the aim should be to find sites capable of accommodating 150,000 people 8,000 acres atleast. For the biggest schemes, there should be elbow room for later expansioneven beyond this figure physical scope for the growth of a major city.12.4. There are few sites in the South-East that can pass these exacting tests.If the site stands on good communications and has economic potential, there will almost certainly be a big town on it already. If there are hundreds of acres ofempty land suitable for building, the site is likely to be off the beaten track. Tofind the sites needed, it has been necessary to take account of likely new developments in communications. The results are given in the next chapter.Town Expansions12.5. Where an existing town is to be expanded, other considerations arise.Again, the prerequisites of good communications and reasonable distance from london must be met; there must be physical space for growth and water supply and sewerage must not present insurmountable problems. But a great deal depends onthe size and economic potential of the town itself, and on its character. one important reason for the slow pace of the present generation of town expansion schemes is the selection of small places for growth on a small scale; even if all had succeeded better, the total result would not have been great.12.6 For the reasons already given, the need is for large schemes now. this implies large towns to base them on, for the attempt to mount a big expansion onto a small town would, in practice, require new town machinery. The large townhas the advantage of a stronger administrative machinery which may either beable to undertake expansion (with suitable reinforcement) or which can co-operate effectively with another agency in doing the job. The presence of all the public services and a good shopping centre makes it possible to embark quickly on a bigprogramme of house-building. If there is industry in the town which can expand,given the labour there will be less need for mobile industry. The populationstructure (unlike that of a new town in its early years) will include the schoolleavers needed by office employers and one of the big needs is to find places where offices can go to from London. Above all, it is likely to become an effectivegrowing point more quickly than a small town being expanded, or a new town.12.7. The search has, therefore, been concentrated on towns which couldsupport a growth of at least 30,000 over and above the natural growth that could beexpected in the town. This has been taken to mean that the likely places are thoseof present population of 50,000 and over (bigger towns can of course be looked to for more than 30,000 growth-perhaps 50 per cent of current population). Smaller
places which seemed prima facie to offer special advantages have not been ignon^;(e.g., the small ports), but by and large, these offer little prospect of rapid large-scalegrowth.12.8. Nor has the search overlooked the possibility of schemes outside the boundary of the Study area; and there are indeed three important proposals which do fall outside. Others were looked at but they failed on physical or economic grounds or were ruled out because of sheer distance from London. Big and successfuldevelopments may indeed take place at some in the latter category and may help to bring about a better national balance of population. But such schemes fall ratherunder the description of efforts to retain population in other parts of the country.12.9. There are various ways of measuring the character and potential of a town, some subjective, some objective. As a practical matter, subjective tests arenot to be despised, for they may greatly influence employers&apos; choices when it comes to making a move. Right or wrong, this is something that has to be allowed for.12.10. A more objective test is provided by the rateable value of the town,and of the different elements in it. This gives a measure of the industrial or commercial strength of a town, of the size and attractiveness of its shopping, andof the entertainments it can offer. One important feature thrown up by an analysis of this kind is an indication of the extent to which the town has proved attractive to office employers in the past.12.11. Another test is the amount of industrial employment offered by thetown, and the extent to which this employment falls within industrial groups which are expanding quickly, slowly or not at all.12.12. This kind of analysis does not and should not lead to a blue-print of a standard type of town labelled suitable for expansion. Different towns can justify their selection in different ways, and play a different part in the scheme of things.For example, towns that can attract from London industry which, for one reason or another, is tied to the south; towns with strong indigenous potential for growth,which need the labour offered by a forced growth scheme and will not draw onthe limited pool of mobile industrial employment; towns with little industrialpotential but which may be especially attractive to office workers and employers.12.13. Moreover, however strongly a theoretical analysis may point to aparticular place, there may be overriding reasons against it. There are clearlysome towns in the South-East which, though otherwise attractive, already haveproblems to which it would be unwise to add by means of a forced growth scheme.Oxford, Cambridge and Brighton are three examples.12.14. In a later chapter, details are given of a number of towns in theSouth-East which seem, prima facie, to offer possibilities of large-scale growth.Just how much growth, at any one of these places, must depend on detailedphysical surveys and discussions, which must be undertaken as soon as it is agreed in principle that a scheme should be started. These will have to cover such questions as the availability of land for housing and industry, the burden placed by population growth on the services of the town as a whole, and the cost of expanding these to meet a rapid rise in population and traffic. The demands which this growth will place on the communications system will need to be examined with great care. Schemes for the development of these towns will haveto be planned to deal adequately with the problems arising from the great increasein the number of cars dealt with in the Buchanan Report. It may not be a questionof adding new developments to the periphery of existing towns laid out on the traditional pattern. It may instead be necessary to create new forms of townstructure which make full provision for transport needs.Studies by Consultants12.15. Some pilot studies have been carried out. In the autumn of 1962, theGovernment commissioned three firms of planning consultants to investigate the planning and financial problems likely to be encountered in the rapid large scaleexpansion of big towns. Three towns were chosen for this exercise, two (Ipswichand Peterborough) which figure in this Study and one (Worcester) which hasbeen regarded as a possible candidate for the reception of overspill fromBirmingham.
p 12.16. None of the three studies, made independently by the three firms,which took a town each for theoretical study, discloses insuperable practicaldifficulties in expansion on the scales envisaged 50 per cent and 100 per cent,spread over 15 years or 25 years. The estimates of total costs vary considerably. Inpart this can be accounted for by the differing degree to which the town centres and existing road networks of the towns were judged to be capable of coping with100 per cent more people and up to 200 per cent more cars; but the variationsalso arise from differences among the consultants on the extent of the measures recommended to cope with such growth. All disclosed that central arearedevelopment was a very significant element in the cost of expansion.12.17. As might have been expected, variations in the difficulty and costof expanding these towns stem from physical considerations peculiar to theparticular town: on such factors as the relative ripeness for redevelopment ofthe existing town centre, on the extent to which works on improving public services,the main road network and the town centre would have to be undertaken even if no steps were taken to bring about forced growth, on the room for manoeuvre in selecting areas for residential and town centre expansion which can be economicallydeveloped.12.18. The particular solutions chosen also have a bearing on cost. Forexample, in one case the consultant proposes that an entirely new town centreshould be built with the road network at a different level from the present one.12.19. Certain broad conclusions can, however, be drawn from the studies.Variations in physical considerations and in the choices available in providing fortown expansion, between one town and another, suggest caution in attempting togeneralise about costs of achieving forced growth of this type. All three studiesindicate that the cost per person of doubling the size of the town is less than thecost of expanding it by only 50 per cent. The critical factor in cost variation isthe extent to which forced growth makes it necessary to undertake town centreredevelopment and improvement of the town&apos;s main road network, on an extensive scale, well before this would occur if the town were left to grow naturally. Theneed to adapt our towns to a very great increase in car ownership and usage, inthe next decade or two, will call for some fundamental and unconventional thinkingon the design of large towns and this will be particularly necessary where forcedgrowth of such towns is envisaged, as in this Study.Water Supply12.20. In all these schemes water supply will be of particular importance, anda separate water supply study is being made in parallel with this planning Study.While there is no reason to fear that enough water cannot be provided to meetthe needs of the growing population of the South-East, present sources of supply,as now developed, will not be adequate; major new schemes will be required. Insome areas (notably South Essex) the supply is already short. The need for morewater will affect the timing of new expansion schemes in some parts of theSouth-East and, in some areas, may limit the number of schemes or scale of expansion that can be undertaken in the short term. The question of water supply is examined in more detail in Appendix 1.Agricultural Land12.21. The South-East has an unusually large proportion of good agricultural land. Some of the best of it, e.g., the Fenland soils, is not particularly attractiveas a site for urban expansion; but in many parts of the region the areas most desirable for development are those of particularly high agricultural quality.Good farmland can often be saved by diverting expansion to one side of a townrather than another, but sometimes there is no easy way of reconciling agricultural and other planning interests and it may then be necessary to avoid or deferlarge-scale growth if the programme can be made up elsewhere.Local Participation12.22. These then are the pointers and the limiting factors that govern the choice of places for expansion. Perhaps the most important has been left untiliast the willingness of the local people and of the local authorities to undertake
or collaborate in a scheme of this kind. That is why an examination of this kinJcan be neither exhaustive nor decisive. It is merely the first stage in a process of consultation and discussion in the course of which many additional factors willhave to be taken into account, of which one will be the views of people who wouldbe affected by the schemes. Chapter 13 tries to convert the ideas into places. Itmay well be that expansion may not prove possible at some of these places either on the scale suggested or at all. It may be that other places will be proposedby the local planning authorities for large-scale growth. But the essential point is that if the population increase in the South-East by 1981 is to be dealt with,and if growth is to be drawn away from London, something of this order is needed.CHAPTER 13.-PLACES FOR EXPANSION13.1. Chapter 11 set out the main principles that have been followed in the selection of places for expansion. Before these generalisations can be followed up with specific suggestions, some reservations must be made.13.2. First, in order to be sure that major schemes of development could becarried out on the scale suggested in this Study, detailed examinations of all thepossible places would have to be carried out. This means more than a physicalsurvey. Particularly where an existing town is to be expanded, a thorough analysis of the consequences of planned growth must be undertaken which would includenot only a straightforward planning survey, but a close examination of thefinancial effects.13.3. With the agreement of the local authorities concerned (who, in givingtheir agreement, did not commit themselves to the idea of expansion) pilot studies of Ipswich and Peterborough have been carried out, and equally thoroughinvestigations will need to be made of other places before it can be decided whetherthey offer a firm base for large expansion and, if so, on what scale. The other placesmentioned in this Chapter have not been subjected to such a detailed examination.But each of them is a probable candidate in the sense that there are considerableopportunities of one sort or another, and that there are no obvious physicallimitations to growth or insurmountable difficulties in the way of providing thenecessary public services.13.4. Secondly, the success of any expansion scheme must owe a great deal to the co-operation of the local authorities and the good will of the local inhabitants,and this implies full discussion and consultation before final decisions are taken. Itmay be asked why this Study, after so long a period of investigation, does not lay down &quot; solutions &quot;. That is the answer. Each one of the proposals made must be fully discussed with the local authorities and other bodies concerned.13.5. The Study avoids suggesting the direction which expansion might take in the neighbourhood of any of the places mentioned. In all cases, this wouldhave to be considered in relation to many factors, of which one would be thewhereabouts of the best agricultural land.13.6. It cannot be over-emphasised that the mention of a place in this chapter does not imply a firm view that large-scale expansion is necessarilypracticable, or even, when the full facts are known, necessarily desirable. The listwhich follows is intended simply to offer a starting point for discussion and consultation. In it, very tentative estimates are given of the scale of expansion thatmay be possible, over and above growth which will take place in any event by excessof births over deaths. Estimates are also given of the amount of growth that maybe possible by the end of the Study period; but this estimate is dependent not onlyon the physical and economic scope for expansion that may be revealed by more detailed examination, but also on the starting date for any particular scheme andits programming.

At some of the places mentioned town expansion (mainly on a small scale) is already proceeding.They are Ashford, Aylesbury, Bletchley and Swindon.3.   The estimates of natural change are provisional, and are made on the assumption that these places will continue to receive the same share of the total natural growth as they have received in recent years.13.7. The list of places is broken down into three sections. The first covers the biggest schemes which offer the best prospects of producing self-generatinggrowth well away from London, and where, in the course of time well after theend of the period of this Study the development may grow to the scale of a newcity. The second group consists of places where the prospects for growth, though not on the same scale, are still considerable; they, too, should exert a powerful pullon population and employment that might otherwise gravitate towards London.The third group comprises the remainder; places where the economic potential is lessclear, or where there may be other difficulties, but where it should nevertheless bepossible to mount expansion schemes substantially larger than those of the current programme.The New Cities13.8. The Southampton-Portsmouth area already has a population ofJ million, with a strong natural growth, and an economic potential centring onthe port. It has excellent deep water facilities, and the Rochdale Committee* onPorts has recommended that it should be built up as a major cargo port.13.9. Whether or not the port is deliberately expanded in this way (andthe recommendations of the Rochdale Committee are still being considered bythe Government), there is little doubt of the  area&apos;s economic potential.* Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Major Ports of Great Britain (Cmnd. 1824).Published by H.M.S.O., price 15s.
Development of the port would allow expansion to take place more easily, burfeven without this, the area should be capable of growth on a scale sufficient tomake a significant contribution to the solution of the South-East problem.13.10. The form of development would require careful consideration. BothPortsmouth and Southampton have populations of over 200,000 already;Portsmouth has its own overspill problems. But, by looking at the whole beltof country from the north of Southampton to the north of Portsmouth, it shouldbe possible to find room for ample expansion at more than one point. A detailed study will be required to produce a further assessment, but there seems no reason why the area should not eventually have a population increase of   million overand above its own natural growth, and 150,000 of this might be achieved by 1981if two or three centres can be developed simultaneously.13.11. Apart from purely economic considerations, the whole area is the onlyone in the South-East which can at present compare with the Greater Londonconurbation. Portsmouth and Southampton are the leading towns outside london in both total population and total rateable value. Both have excellent shoppingcentres, and are well provided with hotels; there is a university at Southampton.In terms of rateable value, Southampton has more offices than any town in theSouth-East, outside Greater London.13.12. Southampton is 77 miles from London, and communications will be considerably improved by the building of the M3 which is already planned as far asBasingstoke, .30 miles from Southampton. It should be possible, in due course,to provide an excellent link between the Southampton-Portsmouth complex and london by means of this road.13.13. Birmingham is 128 miles from Southampton, and development of theport would enable it to serve the West Midlands as well as the South-East. Thiswould call for improvement of the communications between the two areas.13.14. The Bletchley area is near the main line of communication(including Ml and the main railway line, which is being electrified) between theWest Midlands and London. It would be difficult to find an area which would bemore attractive to industrialists. There should be no trouble in finding enoughemployment for a new town here, and a large and successful development shouldbe possible. There is plenty of room for building, and, in the very long term, a newcity of a quarter of a million might arise. By 1981, a growth of 75,000 might beachieved.13.15. The existing town of Bletchley had a population of only 16,900 in1961, and there is not a sufficient base for building up the area by means of expansion of the existing town. The growth potential of the area&apos;s existing industryis only moderate, but the natural economic advantages of the location should ensure the success of a new town.13.16. Bletchley already has an agreement with London under the town development Act for the reception of over 10,000 people, and has received a population increase of over 5,500 under this scheme.13.17. The Newbury-Hungerford area lies on the main line of roadcommunication between London and Bristol, and is roughly equi-distant from thesetwo centres. Its communications will be still further improved when the M4 is completed. The M4 will also provide an excellent link with the South Walesindustrial complex.13.18. The advantages of the area are further increased by its strategic position on the main link between the West Midlands and Southampton (A34).Newbury is only 40 miles from Southampton, and a major development therewould obviously tie in well with expansion at Newbury. If, in time, developmentof the port at Southampton led to the improvement of communications betweenthe port and the West Midlands, the cross roads with the M4 would be in theNewbury area. These developments could give Newbury an even larger potentialthan Bletchley. It should be possible to plan initially for a population increase of something like 150,000, with hope of growth to a quarter of a million later- andto achieve 75,000 of this by 1981.
Hp 13.19. As with Bletchley, the existing nucleus of development is small-20,000 at Newbury itself. There is no great existing industrial potential in the area,but the natural advantages of its position should make up for this; again, for thisreason, any major development would have to take the form of a new town. Onedrawback is that much of the surrounding area contains farmland of high quality.Other Large Expansions13.20. In addition to these three new cities, there are six places which might provide scope for expansion on a considerable scale of the order of 50,000 to100,000 over and above the natural growth of each area.13.21. Four of these are based on big towns well away from London. One isIpswich, 72 miles from London and in an area which has not so far experiencedthe exceptionally large population and employment increases which have takenplace to the west and north-west of London. The others Northampton,Peterborough and SvAndon are all over 65 miles from London, and outside theSouth-East Region. Northampton and Peterborough enjoy excellent road and rail communications with the Midlands and the North, as well as with London. Swindonis the outstanding example of a successful town development scheme. The fact thatit has been able to do this, at a distance of 80 miles from London, and with its ownproblems of declining employment in the railway workshops, is an indication of its economic potential.13.22. Two other big schemes are largely dependent on the carrying outof other development. If the Government should decide to establish a thirdinternational airport for London at Stansted, in Essex, the employment directly and indirectly generated would provide the initial impetus for a new town in this general area, and its development would be further stimulated by the constructionof the Bishop&apos;s Stortford motorway. Similarly, there would be big possibilities atAshford if it were decided to proceed with a cross-Channel link; if this took theform of a tunnel, the main railhead would be in the area south-east of the town.In that event, there would be scope for development on a scale far greater than thatof the present small town expansion scheme, and this might take the form of a newtown. At both Stansted and Ashford, the target population might be of the orderof 100,000.Other Expansions13.23. The other places mentioned in the Table are suggested as suitable bases for expansion judged by the criteria set out in Chapters 11 and 12. In varying degrees,they enjoy the advantages of good communications and potential for employmentgrowth of one kind or another. Several seem particularly well suited to attract officeemployment away from London, and three are university towns. At these places,it seems likely that there is both economic potential and physical scope for expansionsof the order of 30,000 by 1981 and at some of them perhaps a good deal more. at certain places and this applies also to those suggested for expansion on a larger scale it may well be that some of the housing land required could suitably be foundin neighbouring towns and villages. This will depend on physical circumstances,and on the communications.Further Growth of Existing New Towns13.24. So far, the establishment of a number of new towns, and the settingin motion of large-scale town expansion schemes have been suggested. At some ofthe places mentioned, town expansion schemes of the old type are in progress,but what is now proposed would involve virtually a fresh start.13.25. The situation is rather different with the current new towns. At someof these there are physical possibilities of further growth-though, in some instances, this will involve an extension of the designated area. The advantage of planning for further growth at a new town now being developed is that the scheme can get away to a quick start. The prospect of economic success is not in doubt at the London new towns and there is in being an organisation to plan and carry through the development, which can follow on from present targets withoutinterruption.13.26. At Stevenage and Harlow, the development corporations have madetechnical examinations of the possibility of further expansion. Both towns areplanned to take an eventual population of 80,000, but the corporations consider
that they could be expanded, without detriment to the structure of the town, 4accommodate an eventual population of 130,000-140,000 at Stevenage and120,000-130,000 at Harlow. If it is decided to go ahead, these two new townswould provide an additional capacity of about 100,000.13.27. There is also some scope for expansion at Basildon, Crawley andHemel Hempstead. The assets of the last two of these have already been handedover to the New Towns Commission. There is therefore no development corporation to carry through the further expansion although the Commission hascertain powers of development. If, however, the amount and the rate of growthat these two places is not too great there is no reason why they should not expandnaturally, like the other towns in the South-East not picked out for forced growth.Centres for Office Dispersal13.28. The whole strategy of decentralisation from London will be undermined if commercial employment cannot be got away from the capital. Thefirst aim must be to get offices a really long way away from London and the successof some of the Government^ own staff dispersal moves shows that some officescan be moved right out of the South-East.13.29. In the South-East itself, many of the places proposed for expansion in this Chapter will be very suitable for office dispersal, and have been chosenwith this in mind. A new town, in its early years, cannot easily provide thesurroundings and the type of labour needed by a commercial employer; for someyears, therefore, the town expansion schemes will have more to offer. Of the bigger ones, Southampton, Ipswich, Northampton and Peterborough should be particularly attractive to employers; and among the others, Aylesbury, Chelmsford,Hastings, Maidstone, Norwich, Reading and Southend. The comparative nearnessto London of the first generation of new towns will be useful to employers who cannot go further afield. Moreover, they are reaching a stage in their development at which they can support strong office growth. In the early years, their unbalancedage structure (illustrated in Fig. 24) made for a shortage of young people seekingoffice work; but from now on the school-leavers will be coming forward in largenumbers. There would be advantage in planning and presenting all these places as major office centres, to be preferred, in the long run, to those nearer London.13.30. But the scope for office development in the South-East is not limitedto places where forced growth is planned. Much office work is done by young people and by married women and for many firms, local recruitment will meetmost of their needs. The provision of a home with a job will be needed for only afew key workers, particularly if the move is of routine operations being hived off from a head office. There are many towns in the South-East that would fill this bill without the setting up of any formal arrangements. Many of the south coast towns fall into this category. Some of them have seasonal unemployment; andtheir character will be attractive to staff who are transferred from London. Somemoderate growth of office employment would also be reasonable at a handful of towns in and near the green belt; such work would offer an alternative tocommuting for those living in and near them. These places might include TunbridgeWells. Tonbridge, Sevenoaks, Reigate, Guildford and Maidenhead. The other sectors around London are well covered by the existing new towns and proposalsfor new expansions.13.31. Finally, there is the problem of the firm which can accept a locationon the periphery of London for some or all of its staff, but has a need for suchclose contacts with its own or other organisations in the City or the West End thatit is genuinely unable to go further afield. To argue that all new offices should bewell away from London and that no new ones should be allowed in any part ofthe capital or its immediate surroundings is to ignore the existence of this problem,and to risk slowing down the pace of decentralisation. Moreover, the growingimbalance between homes and jobs in London, and the high cost of providingmore transport capacity point to the need for some good office centres on theperiphery. To the extent that peripheral offices are needed, they should be concentrated in attractive centres so placed that they give as much relief as possibleto the transport services.13.32. Ideally, these centres should have a fast, preferably non-stop service to a London terminus; good local road and rail communications so that staff canbe drawn from people living in the neighbourhood; and a good shopping centre
ipose by. Peripheral centres of this sort can help in easing congestion in the centralarea and on the last few overcrowded miles on the suburban railways. Theyshould reduce the pressure on the heart of London and, in the long run, help tobring demand down to a point at which central area redevelopment schemes are held back, and some perhaps abandoned altogether.13.33. Where such peripheral office centres should be provided, and their number, must be a matter for consideration by the planning authorities in the firstplace; but, by way of example, suitable towns might include Ilford, Romford,Dartford, Bromley, Croydon, Surbiton, Kingston, Uxbridge and Watford.Summary13.34. In short, this Study suggests that, subject to detailed examination and full local consultation, the need to draw people and jobs away from London, andto provide homes and work for about 1  million people (over and above localgrowth) should be met by a programme consisting of:(a) 3 new cities (Southampton/Portsmouth, Bletchley and Newbury);(b) 6 big new expansions (Ashford, Ipswich, Northampton, Peterborough,Swindon and Stansted);(c) 12 other schemes on a substantial scale; and(d) growth beyond the present population targets at some of the presentLondon new towns.Of the new schemes, those at Bletchley, Newbury, Ashford and Stansted wouldbe new towns, and the others town expansions. In addition, certain other townsshould consciously be built up as office centres.13.35. It is hazardous to try to assess whether all these schemes, coupled with developments already under way, will provide for 1^ million people by 1981.At this stage, nobody can tell how many of the new schemes will survive the processes of detailed examination and consultation; there are likely to be casualties.It is difficult also to try to estimate how much progress might be madewith each scheme by 1981; this can be little better than guesswork. A lot of workwill need to be done on timing and programming after decisions in principle havebeen taken. But even on the assumptions that all the schemes went ahead and didwell; that all the present new towns and town expansions proceeded successfully;and that additions to the population targets of some of the existing new towns were approved the total capacity that would be realised by 1981 does not amount to more than \\ million. This is too narrow a margin for comfort; and if any of the bigger new schemes should meet with difficulty, there would have to be a search forsubstitutes.Timing13.36. For practical reasons, it is unlikely that the greater part of thedevelopment envisaged in this Study could take place until the Seventies, and it isduring that decade that the rate of progress in the expansion schemes would reachits peak. First the schemes must be discussed and provisionally agreed subjectto full examination by local enquiry; outline and then detailed plans must bedrawn up; and the statutory processes of designation and land acquisition must begone through. After all that, it will take time before the building rate touches its maximum.13.37. Nevertheless, not all the problems of the South-East will wait untilthe Seventies. The population growth is happening now; and, above all, the rapidrate of employment increase in London is presenting ever widening problems. Itwill take time to check this increase, and it will help if an early start can be madeat one or two places for example, those which might draw commercialemployment from London to reinforce the effect of the current programme for new and expanded towns.13.38. Two candidates are the existing new towns of Stevenage and Harlowwhich might well be increased in size; the machinery is there, and the preliminaryplanning has been done. There are also possibilities of early action at Swindon.Peterborough and Ipswich would also have a head start because of the detailedsurveys that have been carried out at these towns.
3 8  *o5CHAPTER 14.-EXPANSION SCHEMES AND EMPLOYMENT14.1. These suggested schemes of planned expansion will not work unlessenough employment is available-at the right time, and of the right kind-forthe people for whom houses are being provided. With the first generation ofnew and expanded towns, the emphasis was on providing the employment needed by the transfer from London of manufacturing industry. There will still be a needfor this; but in the future there should be less emphasis on mobile industrial employment and much more on other sources of work.14.2. An important question is whether enough jobs can be provided in theSouth-East without prejudice to the development of other parts of the country.The build-up in those parts will depend on the continued diversion to them of allpossible mobile employment, through industrial location control and through the fiscal and other financial benefits provided. In the competition for miobileemployment, these areas must continue to have priority over the South-East not only for their own sake but also because failure to stimulate growth in theless flourishing parts of the country will lead to more southward migration andconsequently a bigger problem in the South-East.Manufacturing Employment14.3. What was said in Chapter 4 about the industrial structure and the geographical advantages of the South-East suggests strongly that, on present trends,there is unlikely to be any Overall shortage of jobs. As far as the South-East isconcerned, therefore, the problem is likely to be the redistribution of employmentgrowth from the congested areas in and around London to the new expandingcentres. The magnitude of this task of redistribution must not be under-estimated.14.4. The scale of employment that would be needed for the schemessuggested in the Study is greater than that required for the existing new and expanded towns, and there is little mobile expanding industry in London itself.There may be more possibilities in the outer metropolitan area, where there hasbeen rapid growth in industrial employment in recent years. But the prior claim for any mobile industry lies outside the South-East altogether.14.5. One weakness of the present situation is that there are very fewattractive alternatives for a firm wishing to expand in the London conurbationand unable to move out of the South-East altogether. There are possibilities inthe existing new towns and in expanded towns; but most of the current expansion schemes are on too small a scale to attract some employers. There are some firms who can satisfy the Board of Trade that there are genuine reasons unusuallyclose links with particular suppliers or markets, for example which prevent them from going further afield. In such cases, there is an unenviable choice betweenallowing the growth to take place in London and preventing it altogether.14.6. Given a wider selection of places to go to, it seems likely that morefirms could remove some of their operations from the conurbation, thus adding tothe total pool of employment on the move. Experience in the new and expandedtowns suggests that a transfer yields more jobs, over and above those that might havebeen created had the firm been allowed to stay in London, because the combination of new premises and housing for workers acts as a stimulus to productivity and because there is room in the physical sense to expand. With a wider choice ofdestinations too, it should be easier to persuade whole firms not merely expandingbranches to leave the conurbation and to take a tougher line with managementswho can show good reason for opposing longer range moves. The stimulus to growthprovided by the expansion of strongly growing centres of the kind envisaged in this study should therefore add to the total amount of mobile industry, and make it easier to find the employment required for the increasing population of the South-East there without doing this at the expense of other parts of the country.14.7. If much of the planned expansion takes place by means of expansionof existing towns rather than new towns, there will be some stimulus to localeconomies. Analysis of the experience of some of the smaller expanded townssuggests that there is considerable growth of local jobs from small expansions insuch towns; for every nine jobs imported into the towns concerned, four have been created by the growth of local industries. Experience with larger town expansion
P^hemes might not be the same, but this gives some measure of the pool of localgrowth which might be released by expansion schemes. The selection of towns withpotential for growth by reason of their industrial structure will reduce the need to introduce industry from outside.Growth of Service Industry14.8. Over and above this stimulated growth of local manufacturing industry,town expansions and new towns will create a considerable growth in serviceemployment. There are some purely local services which grow with the populationof an area. To this extent, town expansion helps to provide its own employment.In England and Wales, over two-fifths of all jobs came from such local services,in the South-East outside London the share is almost a half. Secondly, there arenational and regional services many of which are tied to the areas of greatestpopulation, in that the increase is in ratio to the population growth. The growth ofthe South-East from natural increase alone is therefore likely to stimulate thecreation of jobs in service industry, which cannot be moved away to help the areasof unemployment.Decentralisation of Offices14.9. There is the further aim of getting a lot of office employment outof London. This subject has been discussed in other Chapters and it is sufficientto repeat here that there should be more long-range transfers to big centres of expansion outside London.Timing14.10. It must be emphasised that it would take years to negotiate, plan andstart to build the large expansions suggested in this Study. As compared withcommitments elsewhere, notably in Central Scotland and the North-East, theproposals in the Study will not start to make significant demands on employmentuntil the Seventies.Conclusion14.11. A good deal of the employment needed can be found in serviceindustries, including office employment, where there is little clash of interestbetween north and south; by the development of latent industrial potential intowns chosen for expansion; and by taking advantage of any growth held backunder existing circumstances because firms cannot transfer their activities outsidethe South-East. Even so, a considerable effort will be needed.CHAPTER 15.-LAND ALLOCATIONS15.1. This part of the Study has so far concentrated on the big new expansion schemes. But these would deal with only about a third of the total populationincrease expected in the South-East.15.2. This leaves the greater part of the growth to be dealt with by normalplanning processes by the allocation of more land in the development plans oflocal planning authorities.15.3. Since the London conurbation is unlikely to house more than its presentpopulation over the period of the Study and will in fact have an overspill of about1 million, the rest of the South-East will have to accommodate 3  million extrapeople. The total is made up as follows:Table VPopulation Growth Outside London, 1961-81MillionsLondon Overspill..................       10Net Migration Gain      ...............       11Natural Increase Outside London      .........       1-4Total      ...............       3-5CONFIDENTIAL3878 - g
* Including additions to the population targets of the existing new towns.15.4. Of this total, l-  million should be accounted for in planned expansioljschemes of one kind or another-l-lj million in the new schemes* suggested inthis Study, and over i million in the current new and expanded towns. The totalgrowth is, of course significant for the local authorities of the South-East, for public services of every kind must be provided. But when it comes to making landallocations, the new and expanded towns fall into a special category; they will call for the preparation of separate master plans or town maps when each expansionscheme is agreed. For that reason, they stand a little to one side of the normalprocess of development plan reviews.15.5. Leaving aside this l^-li million which requires separate treatment andwhich covers much of the overspill and migration, the local planning authoritiesoutside the London conurbation need to allocate, as part of their review of their development plans for the period ending in 1981, land for over 2 million people.15.6. This total of about 2 million is made up of three elements, and its composition to some extent governs the areas where the land should be madeavailable for development. The first consists of the natural increase of the populationliving outside London, and is spread over the whole of the South-East. The second is migration for retirement; this is localised and the effects are felt most strongly insome towns on the South Coast. The third is voluntary overspill from London; theLondoners who move out privately, rather than in planned overspill schemes,many of them&apos; continuing to work in London. The main brunt of this type of movement falls on the counties immediately surrounding London in the outer metropolitan region. Over and above this, some allowance must be made for contingencies.Natural Increase15.7. In calculating the natural increase to be expected in the area of eachlocal planning authority in the South-East, the method adopted in Chapter 5 for regional population projections has been used. The rate of future increase has been based on the rate of growth experienced in each area over the period 1956-62. this method makes allowance for the change in population structure caused bymigration, and is particularly useful in giving warning of areas where a bigturnover of population may lead to unexpectedly heavy rates of natural increase.Conversely, this type of calculation brings out those areas where inward migrationof elderly people for retirement has resulted in a population structure which gives a very small rate of natural increase, and very often an excess of deaths overbirths. A word of warning is necessary however. While this technique can beapplied with confidence to large units of population, such as the South-East as awhole, the results must be treated cautiously in their application to smaller areas for example, to a single town or a small county.Voluntary Overspill15.8. Of the other elements of population growth for which land must be allocated, spontaneous movement out of London represents a demand mainly onthe inner parts of the Home Counties adjoining the conurbation, because a large part of it is commuter overspill. Though some people working in London areprepared to face longer daily journeys, the greater number of the commuters will seek homes in the outer metropolitan region. Allocations of land for this purpose will, above all, need to match the transport services; extra land will be needed wherethere is at present spare capacity on the railways and more will have to be allocated in those sectors where rail improvements are decided upon.Retirement15.9. The main weight of migration for retirement falls elsewhere in theSouth-East. The heaviest provision of land for this purpose will have to be madeby the coastal counties and county boroughs.Contingency Allowance15.10. While a primary aim of the expansion schemes is to divert migrantsfrom London, and while the estimated rate of migration for work to the South-East
Allocations to the Planning Authorities15.13. Table VI makes a provisional allocation of these land demands inthe South-East outside the London conurbation, county by county. The Tableexcludes the proposals for new expansion schemes and for additions to existing schemes, which will have to be considered individually and separately, and whichmight account for about \\ million of the total population increase. This allocation,which falls to be dealt with in normal development plan reviews, covers the balanceof just over 2 million people, plus the contingency allowance of   million.15.14. The Table distinguishes between the two main sources of populationincrease which the local planning authorities may expect. The first is natural increase; the second is population movement voluntary overspill from London,and migration for retirement. The contingency allowance is also included underthis second head, and the figures have been rounded; for the allocation, area byarea, of particular types of population movement must, outside planned expansion schemes, necessarily be speculative.15.15. The allocation of population targets to county boroughs presentsspecial difficulty for two reasons. In the first place, some of the county boroughs inthe South-East have comparatively small populations, and the calculation of naturalchange is particularly vulnerable to error with small units. Secondly, some county boroughs may be physically unable to provide the land needed for their natural increase or for any newcomers; and this may give rise to local overspill problems.Has been taken as one pointer in arriving at the size of the expansion programme,it would be naive to expect that every migrant from outside the region will findhis home in a new or expanded town. Movement is going on all the time; andthe possibility has to be faced that because of planning or investment difficulties,the full programme may not be realised by 1981.15.11. For all these reasons, allowance must be made in development plans for the fact that there is likely to be some migration for work in those areas where employment is growing strongly. This is very important in the outer metropolitan area, where the pull of London is likely in the shorter term at anyrate to create an additional demand for housing land. Some flourishing towns inthe South-East which are not suggested for expansion will also continue to drawin migrants. In the South-East as a whole, an allowance of about \ million might reasonably be made under this head.15.12. There are more general reasons for making land allocations on a generous basis. Errors are inevitable in estimating needs over a 20-year period;if they are under-estimated, artificial land shortages are created and land prices are forced up unnecessarily. Builders, seeing that their needs are not being met,are tempted to hoard land against future needs, and there is a risk of startinga vicious circle of rising prices and shortages in the very areas where buildingland is most needed. Even where the situation is easier, some margin of choiceis needed; it is poor planning to attempt to equate demand and supply exactly.The risk of over-provision is very slight, as population trends are now going;the worst that might happen is that the land might come to be developed a fewyears later than was expected when it was allocated.

is situation is not a new one, and it should normally be possible for neighbouringplanning authorities to settle the matter by direct discussion. The estimates of naturalchange given in Table VI should not be taken to mean that a particular countyborough disposes of enough land to meet any increase that may be mentioned. the changes from other causes have been grouped together on a county basis; again,the local allocations of land to meet them may be governed by physical factors.15.16. Local planning authorities in the outer metropolitan area may find itdifficult, within the context of present policies, to find enough land. They have toprovide for strong natural increase; for commuter overspill; for migrants drawn in by employment growth in London; for the continuation and for the extensionof the existing new towns; and, in the outer part of the area, for a few of the newexpansion schemes. All this in an area which contains over 800 square miles ofgreen belt, and proposed extensions to it that would take in another 1,200 square miles. The implications of all this growth for the green belt are discussed in chapter 16.15.17. While the finding of enough land to meet the totals suggested inTable VI will be difficult enough in some places, it must be remembered that the totals would be even higher if it were not assumed that the new planned expansion schemes would cater for a third of all the growth in the South-East. If for practicalor other reasons it does not prove possible to mount a programme of the ordersuggested in Chapter 10, it will be necessary to increase the scale of provision in development plans.CHAPTER 16.-THE LONDON GREEN BELTGreen Belts and Population Growth16.1. The main problem in the South-East is that of accommodating growth.Green belts, on the other hand, are instruments primarily of restriction. Moreover,it is of the essence of green belt policy that the restriction should be permanent. Butpermanent restriction sits uneasily with the knowledge that steady populationincrease is likely in the South-East, not only during the period covered by this Study,but for as long afterwards as anyone can foresee. Whatever may be achieved byde-centralisation, the pressures arising from current growth in and around Londonare falling in areas which are critical for the future of the green belt. Over the periodof the Study, there is likely to be a natural increase of one million people in theLondon conurbation the area surrounded by the green belt and a natural increasenearly as great (870,000) in the outer metropolitan region, the ring of mingled townand country in which the green belt and the proposed extensions are situated.16.2. There is a real conflict here which will not be solved on the one handby crying &quot; inviolable &quot;; or, on the other hand, by scrapping one of the mainachievements of post war planning, which still has a vital role to play.16.3. This conflict has led to much public discussion of the purpose andfunction of the London green belt, and to some criticism of its boundaries. Criticsargue (with some force) that the popular idea of the green belt as a playground forLondoners is belied by the facts; that much of it consists of airfields, hospitalgrounds, water reservoirs and agricultural land to which the public have no access.They can say, too, that a large part of the green belt is far from being fine landscape gravel pits, some of the smallholdings and market gardens and the indeterminate andcharacterless type of land on the fringes of London. Some maintain that partsof the green belt have lost their original purpose and are little more than high-classresidential areas defended for property reasons.16.4. There are good answers to many of these arguments. Nobody need beashamed of a green belt that includes the Chilterns, the Surrey Hills and the thames Valley; and the existence of semi-urban uses in the green belt is no reasonfor building on it. Land is needed for the sports grounds and the hospitals and the water reservoirs. The green belt must meet not only these current needs,but must provide a future reserve for uses of this kind. Quite apart fromthe preservationist reasons for defending the green belt, positive planning requires that a large part of its area should not be built on.
* (House of Commons Hansard, 26th February, 1963, Col. 1160.)CONFIDENTIAL16.5. But it is less easy to explain the value of some parts of the green beljjNot all green belt land need be of high landscape value; any undeveloped landcan provide a barrier to prevent coalescence, and open land of any sort can forma useful part of a larger whole. But some of the green belt close to London isnot only characterless but ugly for example, some of the derelict glasshouses inthe Lea Valley, which were described by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment as &quot; no adornment to the green belt &quot;.*16.6. There is also the argument that since the essence of a green belt isinviolability it should be untouchable; that once properly defined, there shouldbe no alterations in its boundaries, no matter how circumstances may change; andthat after the first nibble, there would be no end to encroachment.A New Approach?16.7. The advocates of change have put forward two main proposals. Thefirst is to push back the boundary half a mile or so from the edge of the conurbationall the way round. The argument is that this would release a lot of land for development, and make it possible to build homes for hundreds of thousands of people. Even if this were so, the objection to this approach is that a detailedprocess of selection would inevitably have to be carried out; the exercise couldnot be done with a pair of dividers. If the half-mile belt contained a common, a valuable gravel reserve and land within the approach to London airport (to takethree random examples) excisions would have to be made. It might well be that other green belt land, which did not happen to fall within the half mile, could be released for building with far less harm if any is to go at all. In short, the problem will not yield to blanket treatment. If something of this sort were to be done,it should be based on detailed surveys by the local planning authorities.16.8. The other idea is more radical; it involves abandoning the green beltin its present form, and constructing an entirely new one. This would not takethe form of a constricting girdle. Instead, development would be allowed to radiatefrom London along the main lines of communication in roughly star-shapedfashion; in between, wedges of green would be carried right into the built-up area.This pattern would have two advantages. It would keep town and country separate,but close together, and it would have a flexibility which the present system lacks,for radial development could proceed to meet the demands of the growingpopulation, without destroying the green wedges. The main difficulty about this idea is that it has come too late. If the green belt had first been defined at a timewhen the facts of population and employment growth in London were fullyknown, this might have been the chosen pattern. But meanwhile, publicfaith has been pledged to the defence of a different type of green belt, and itsboundaries have been defined and approved. Development has been planned and carried through against the background of a green belt, rather than green wedges,and much property has changed hands in the belief that there would be no radicalalteration.Demands on the Green Belt16.9. Even in the past, the green belt has never been literally inviolable.Both the local planning authorities, and the Minister on appeal, have found itnecessary to authorise development in the green belt from time to time, either because the facts made an irresistible case for an exception to policy, or because, onclose examination, the green belt boundary proved to be indefensible at a particularpoint. For the future, it seems impossible to accommodate the whole of thepopulation growth that must be expected, and in particular to deal with the concentration of growth that is inevitable in the outer metropolitan region, withoutreleasing a limited amount of green belt land for development. On the other hand,there can be no question of going to the other extreme and abandoning the conception of a green belt around London. This was made clear in the LondonWhite Paper:&quot; The Government believe that the green belt should remain a permanent feature of the planning policy for London. They will maintain the approvedgreen belt without substantial change, and they will make extensive additions to it.&quot; (Paragraph 64.)
16.10. Table VI provides a broad estimate of the housing demand whichis likely to arise in the outer metropolitan region over the Study period (excludingdemands arising from existing or new schemes of planned expansion). If this demand could be met by building anywhere in the 40-mile ring around London,there would be no great problem; but much of it is tied to particular places. the green belt and the proposed extensions contain some of the most thriving townsin South-East England. These towns and the green belt ring generally can expectstrong natural growth and, on present trends, employment growth that will retain the consequent increase in their labour force and call for more. Even in the smallertowns and settlements in the green belt many of the young people growing up will want local homes. Allocations of land in other parts of the South-East will not meet these local needs.16.11. Then there are the needs generated by London. Earlier Chapters haveshown that some part of London&apos;s housing needs will be met by a continuation of the process whereby people move out of the capital and find their own homesin the outer metropolitan region. Further, increasing employment in Londonwill continue to make a call for more workers than can live in theconurbation. Some of these will be commuters moving out of London; somewill be drawn from the existing population of the outer metropolitan area;and others will be migrants drawn from elsewhere but driven, by lack of space in London, to find their homes outside. For these people too, allocations of land at long distances from London will not serve. Their homes must be within reasonable reach of a railway line to London and one which has, or can produce,capacity to spare and the journey to London should not be excessively long.It is true that some people commute long distances daily, notably from the townson the South Coast. It is one thing to do this as a matter of choice; quite anotherto be compelled to do so because houses and housing land are not to be foundwithin reasonable travelling distance of London. Moreover, long distancecommuting is expensive and it cannot be expected that the ordinary Londonworker will wish to pay for a daily round trip of 60 to 100 miles. In 1961, well over a million people were entering and leaving the central area daily; but ofthese, only 17,000 held season tickets from places outside the outer metropolitan region.16.12. The nature of the housing demand therefore calls for the allocation of some land close to London, in the ring which contains the approved green belt.In this part of the green belt, the presumption is strongly against change, and givenall the other possibilities, there should be no need to take extensive areas for development. A great deal can be done within the framework of existing planningpolicies. Local planning authorities were invited by the Minister of Housing andLocal Government in 1960* to reconsider their practice on densities, and manyare now applying new standards. The planning bulletin on residential densities that shown how modest increases in densities at the lower end of the range,combined with good housing lay-outs, can produce homes for many more peopleper acre of land. In the towns themselves, opportunities will arise for the redevelopment of older residential areas; in green belt towns experiencing strongpopulation growth, it is particularly important to secure the highest density thatis reasonable in the circumstances of the site being redeveloped in order to reducethe demand for new land.16.13. A good deal could also be done by modest adjustment of town mapareas, even in the approved green belt. There must be few places where it canconvincingly be argued that it is impossible to allow any peripheral extension, no matter how small, to the area allocated for development. Where there is no dangerof one country town running in to another, a small extension of this kind can produce land for many houses without making any serious impact on the generalshape of the green belt and without damaging its main functions.16.14. In areas outside the towns and other large settlements, there is much less scope for change. In the countryside, there should be no relaxation ofthe general presumption against development; otherwise there would be no pointin having a green belt. But in some villages, there is scope for infilling and* Circular No. 37/60 (H.M.S.O., price 3d.).f Planning Bulletin No. 2 &quot; Residential Areas-Higher Densities &quot;, issued by the Ministry of housing and Local Government (H.M.S.O., price 2s.).
rounding-off terms which are notoriously difficult to define and to apply &apos;Mparticular places. What may be permissible is influenced by the shape anacomposition of the village, the road pattern, the contours and features of thelandscape, and the facilities and public services which are available. The design and visual quality of the development proposed will also be of the first importance.16.15. None of the methods suggested so far for providing more homes inthe green belt ring involves taking- land out of the green belt, except perhapsmarginally on the fringe of existing towns. But there is also the problem ofland on the fringe of London, the character of which has changed since the greenbelt boundaries were first drawn. Some of this land might make a most valuable contribution towards meeting the land shortage. There are strong arguments forsuggesting that it would be better to allow building on land of this sort insteadof taking open country further out. The London County Council, with Essex andHertfordshire, are already examining the possibilities offered by the Lea Valley;and there may be other areas of this kind which should be considered similarly.Summary on the Approved Green Belt16.16. In the ring immediately surrounding London, therefore, there will be heavy demands for housing land of a character that cannot all be shiftedelsewhere. It should be possible to meet most of this demand within existingplanning policies by reviewing towns maps, increasing densities, and encouragingresidential redevelopment. Some modest extensions of town map areas may alsobe called for, on a scale which would neither affect the general size or shape ofthe approved green belt, nor interfere with its functions of containing the mainbuilt up mass of London, keeping separate the country towns outside, andpreserving the fine countryside of the Home Counties. A positive examinationof villages in the green belt might also yield useful results. Finally, some of thefringe land on the edge of London might be developed with advantage; but onlyin a limited number of places where the character of the land justifies this. any changes that may be necessary in the green belt will be small, and should be planned as a whole with regard to the final result. As was made plain in theLondon White Paper, it should be for the local planning authorities themselvesto consider initially what areas might be suitable for housing, and to make proposals which can be examined by public local inquiry, bearing in mind thescale of the demand that has to be met and the likely continuance of that demandafter the end of the period covered by this Study.The Green Belt Extensions16.17. In the outer ring, covered by the proposed extensions to the greenbelt, there is much greater freedom for manoeuvre, for the boundaries have notbeen firmly fixed.16.18. Many of the problems are similar. The area will have to meet its share of the general population growth in the outer metropolitan region. There willbe strong local growth, and some parts are close enough to London to take someof the growing numbers of commuters. At the same time, there are very strong arguments for strengthening the present green belt around London by makingvery extensive additions to it. Population increases on the scale contemplated inthis Study will be no bar to this; but the boundaries of the extensions that are needed should be settled with proper regard to long-term needs, for there is clearly a limit to the amount of land that can be and ought to be allocated for development in the ring which lies closer to London.16.19. The danger of spreading the green belt extensions too far afield, andof drawing them tightly round existing development is that, in the long run,population pressures will make it impossible to hold the line. The green beltbecomes of less value if each new reassessment makes it necessary to re-draw the boundaries. If the green belt is to be strongly maintained, and if it is to enjoypopular support and respect, its boundaries must be such that they can withstandall foreseeable pressures. This means that land should be allocated for development on a scale that is fully adequate to meet the needs set out in this Study; and further,that some margin of unallocated land should be left in town map areas to meetlong-term needs without cutting into approved areas of green belt.
HP1 16.20. There is therefore a case for a critical examination of the proposedextensions. The first step is to make the land allocations that are needed and, where this can be done, leave a margin of undeveloped land for later needs. The next stepis to consider the shape of the green belt area which can and should be protectedin the long term. The approved green belt will hold the physical expansion ofLondon in check. In the extensions the two main aims should be to maintain the separate identity and the physical separation of communities like St. Albansand Hemel Hempstead, or Guildford and Woking; and to avoid building on finelandscape.16.21. The amount of countryside which needs to be retained to make an effective break between towns depends to some extent on the local topography.In many places, quite a narrow gap may be sufficient, provided that the townshave direct access to a wider sweep of open country in some other direction.Similarly, there is no rule of thumb for defining valuable landscape. There are some areas of outstanding national scenic value like parts of the Chilterns which are obvious candidates for permanent protection: other less well-knownfeatures of great local importance, like Sharpenhoe Beacon, or Luton Hoo; andstretches of attractive country which need permanent protection, not so muchbecause of their appearance but because their proximity to a big town makesthem both valuable and vulnerable.16.22. In other words, in the areas at some distance from London a positivereason should be shown if it is intended to bring land into the rigidity of the green belt system. There should be a case for acting now; for example, where two towns are close together or where a stretch of good countryside is threatened with urban encroachment that would destroy its scale or diminish its value as a rural lung for town-dwellers.Use of the Green Belt16.23. Finally, there should be more emphasis on the positive functions ofthe green belt. The initial aim namely to halt the indiscriminate urban sprawl ofLondon has been achieved by the establishment of the green belt as part of theplan for Greater London. A study of the plans for towns and smaller settlementswithin the green belt ring and of planning permissions granted for buildingdevelopment outside these urban areas shows that in general the green belt hasbeen firmly held with relatively little encroachment over the last 15 years or so,notwithstanding the very strong pressures for building.16.24. Ail land in the green belt should have a positive purpose; whether it beits quality as farmland, its mineral resources, its special scenic value, its suitabilityfor public open space or playing fields for Londoners, or for those land usesgenerated by the main built-up area but which cannot suitably be located within it such as reservoirs and institutions needing large areas of open land around,them. Most of the approved green belt passes one or more of these tests withoutargument; but there are in it some areas without character or quality whichat present cannot be seen to serve any positive function.16.25. There is a need to survey and plan the green belt in a thorough and positive way so that the land in it is effectively used, so that the worthwhilecountryside can not only be preserved but enhanced for the enjoyment of Londoners,and so that the opportunities for active recreation, which are increasingly in demand, can be fully exploited. The worked-out gravel pits in the river valleysare a good example of opportunity to reconcile the demands for mineral working and disposing of London&apos;s rubble and other waste material with positive landscapingand imaginative comprehensive development of areas for recreation in the openair sailing, fishing, water sports of all kinds, and playing fields. More publicaccess to enable people to walk through the countryside; more provision of carparks in suitable places to allow the motorist to stretch his legs or picnic, are other objectives for consideration.The Green Belt of the Future16.26. A re-examination of the green belt and its extensions on the lines suggested in the Chapter should lead to a stronger and larger green belt; onewhich it will be easier to hold secure against the population pressures of the future;and one which will contribute more positively to the health and well-being of8 million Londoners.
16.27. There may be understandable anxiety at the thought that some grtfljbelt land may be allocated for housing after the counties have reviewed the position.But, so far as the approved green belt is concerned, any changes are likely to bevery small. Much will depend on the ingenuity and determination of the local planning authorities in finding the land needed in other ways, in particular, byreviewing their town maps and increasing densities. Some idea of the scale ofthings can be given by the fact that even if the planning authorities were to decide that they wanted to find homes for as many as 150,000 people in the approvedgreen belt, this would take only 1 per cent of the whole, leaving the other 99 percent intact.CHAPTER 17.-INVESTMENT17.1. It was made clear at the start that this Study was primarily concernedwith land-thQ problem of getting enough land allocated and brought intodevelopment to provide for the large population increase which the South-Easthas to face over the next 20 years or so. The Study is not concerned with investment as such. Though the strategy outlined in it would clearly have implications amongst other things for the pattern of investment, it would not of itself make important new calls on national resources. It is much more concerned with the questionwhere necessary development could be carried through to the best advantage.17.2. Nevertheless it is clear that in order to meet population growth a lot of money, both public and private, will have to be spent in building houses,schools, shops, offices, factories and roads and on public services of all kinds.Money will also have to be spent in remedying existing deficiencies in the socialfabric and in carrying through normal renewal. Broadly speaking this is money which will be spent sooner or later, but there are bound to be priorities.17.3. So far as public service investment is concerned, the Study does not inany way imply either increasing it or bringing it forward at the expense of other programmes.Local Costs17.4. The main proposal in the Study is that there should be a programmeof new and expanded towns with the object of decentralising growth from London.Land and development costs are higher in London than elsewhere in the South-East.There is a further advantage from steering growth away from London sincereduction in the number of commuters reduces and delays the demand for improvements in the transport services.17.5. For the reasons explained earlier it is desirable to concentrate thisgrowth into a number of large expansions. Studies of the cost of expansion oflarge towns and the further enlargement of some new towns show that the unitcost of development falls as the size of the town is increased to a quarter of amillion (studies have not yet been made of larger towns). In other words, one town of 150,000 costs less than three of 50,000, besides having many other advantages.Regional Costs17.6. The local savings from concentrated development are unlikely to be offset by higher regional costs on basic services-water, electricity and gas sincethe towns proposed for growth are conveniently situated and expenditure mustbe made on these services simply to meet the growth in population however it is distributed.17.7. Water supplies require special explanation. Until now, water supplieshave been locally planned but in South-East England in the future they must be planned on a regional basis. (Details are given in Appendix 1.) It would be desirableto initiate the works required soon since they will take several years to plan andexecute, but their cost would be relatively small.17.8. The strategy of the Study has been based very largely on the roadcommunications that already exist in the South-East, and on improvements and additions already firmly planned. The most important of these are the motorwaysto South Wales, Bishop&apos;s Stortford and Basingstoke. Little addition to existingplans will be required (or can be expected) during the present decade. In the longer term, as was made clear earlier, there may be a case for improvingSouthampton&apos;s communications with the Midlands.
w 17.9. Many of the places suggested for expansion will need good feeder roadsto the motorways; where existing towns are to be expanded, such roads would be needed in any event, but it may be necessary to plan them in such a way that theycan take more traffic.London17.10. The total transport requirements of London itself will be seen in betterperspective when the results of the London Traffic Survey are available. The Surveywill provide an invaluable basis for working out developments to London&apos;s road system, but the policy of easing central area congestion by the decentralisation of office employment may increase the need for improved lateral communications inthe outer areas.17.11. On the railways, the main need would be for improvement of thesuburban services. Fairly heavy capital expenditure would probably be needed,but the amount would be less if it proves practicable to provide extra capacity bythe rearrangement of services. London Transport might also have to undertakecostly improvements.17.12. The suggested policy of dispersal from London would probably tendto reduce investment on road and rail together.CHAPTER 18.-SUMMARY AND GENERAL CONCLUSIONSummary18.1.   These are the main points arising out of the Study:(i) Population. There is likely to be a population increase of about1\ million in the South-East over the period 1961-81, of whichnearly 2\ million will be excess of births over deaths in theSouth-East, and just over one million net inward migration fromall sources. Further growth probably at a higher rate so far asnatural increase is concerned is likely after 1981.(ii) London. The heart of the South-East problem lies in the strongpopulation and employment growth of the London conurbationand the area immediately surrounding it. During the period of the study an overspill of about one million from London must beexpected. About 400,000 of these will find their own homes outside london, many of them in the outer metropolitan region, thebreadwinners travelling to work in London daily. The remaining600,000 will need homes and work in towns well beyond the Londongreen belt. But, because of natural increase in the conurbation,the population at the end of the period is expected to be close toits present level of 8 million. The number of jobs particularlyoffice jobs in London is likely to go on rising for some time.(iii) Local Population Growth. Most of the population growth in theSouth-East can be looked after by normal planning processes; butlocal planning authorities will have to allocate much more land.Their development plans will have to provide land to accommodatewell over 2 million people by 1981.(iv) Expansion Schemes. There should be a second generation of new and expanded towns, conceived on a larger scale than those nowbeing built. The need is for big schemes in locations favourable for growth. They should accommodate London overspill, andshould pull away some of the migrant population and employmentgrowth that might otherwise be drawn into the London orbit. the biggest of these schemes should, in time, grow into major citiesof the future, and act as strong counter-attractions to London. a programme for l-l  million people is required.(v) Places for Expansion. Major cities could be developed for exampleby expansion in the Southampton / Portsmouth area and by thebuilding of big new towns at Bletchley and Newbury. New townsmight also be built at Ashford (Kent) and Stansted (Essex); and large-scale town expansion schemes could be based on Ipswich,Northampton, Peterborough and Swindon. Smaller, but stillsubstantial, additions could be made to some of the existing new towns and to a dozen other towns in the South-East. Some of

But if a handful of attractive schemes can be got goingquickly it will ease the pressure on London.(vii) Investment. This Study makes no specific proposals for capital investment. So far as public service investment is concerned, whatis done in the South-East and its timing must depend on nationalpriorities.(viii) Transport. Substantial improvements to the London suburban railservices and the London Transport network will be needed. Inthe rest of the South-East, the big expansion schemes rest on theexisting pattern of main roads, and on firm proposals to buildnew motorways. But, in addition, Southampton may need greatly improved links with the Midlands,(ix) The Green Belt. The London green belt is vital and must stay. Butthere are strong arguments for finding a limited amount of housingland in the green belt, and it seems likely that this can be done without any serious loss. The proposals for extending themetropolitan green belt should be critically re-examined before they are confirmed, but substantial parts of them should be approved.General Conclusion18.2. So far as the basic problem is concerned, there is little choice; large population increases in the South-East are inevitable. Twenty-year forecasts can gobadly wrong; but present evidence suggests that if the estimates made in this Studyprove to be inaccurate, they will be shown to be under-estimates.18.3. Where the choice does lie is in the type of plan to deal with thepopulation increase. The Study, while recognising the strength of the economicforces which are leading to more and more growth in the London area, takes as its main principle the decentralisation of population and employment. The aimis to break the vicious circle of growth generating more growth in the most crowdedand congested part of the South-East not only the London conurbation itself, butthe ring around it, which has been experiencing the fastest population growth ofany part of the country.18.4. At this stage, it is difficult to make any reliable forecast of the distributionof the population growth over the South-East; much depends on the number of the planned expansions which can be got under way, and the speed at which they canbe developed. But the policy suggested in the Study would produce the kind ofpattern shown in the following Table, which makes certain assumptions forillustrative purposes.Table VTIDistribution of Population Growth in the South-East, 1951-61 and 1961-81
i^PThis Table shows that, in spite of the greater total growth to be accommodated inthe South-East, a much smaller share of this total would, under the proposals inthis Study, be concentrated in the belt around London. The amount of increasethere, over the 20-year period of the Study, would be at a slightly lower rate than over the last 10; and the proportion of the total growth which would go tothe outer metropolitan region would fall sharply.18.5. This would make a start on the road towards a more even distributionof population growth in the South-East; and, as the new big cities build up, thechange in the pattern of population growth would be reinforced by a gradual shiftin the economic balance within the South-East.18.6. The starting point of the Study was an estimate of the amount of population growth that is likely to take place in the South-East. This madeallowance for improvements in other regions; but a great deal of the growth inthe South-East is unconnected with anything that might or might not happen inother places. Given this estimate there is an urgent need to make plans now forthe accommodation of this large and inescapable population increase in the best way and to make sure that enough land, is brought forward to provide for it.The Need for Review18.7. Nobody who has examined the history of planning in London and theSouth-East since the days before the war can fail to be conscious of the possibilityof error and of the possibility of social and economic changes that may overturnbasic assumptions. There is no way of avoiding mistakes when planning for a long period ahead; but regular and frequent reviews can give early warning if eventsare falsifying predictions. These should be provided for.
APPENDIX 1WATER SUPPLIES IN SOUTH-EAST ENGLANDSummary of the Water SituationALL A critical factor for the carrying through of the big new schemes of expansion, and, indeed, in the accommodation of the population increase in theSouth-East generally, is the provision of adequate supplies of water. an examination of the water supply situation in South-East England is being made in parallel with this planning study.A1.2. The broad conclusion on water is that, given the necessary expenditureon schemes to develop sources of supply, and given statutory powers to undertake the works, where these are required, there is no overriding obstacle to the provisionof enough water to meet the needs of the population of the Study area, whichwill have grown to well over 21 million by 1981.A1.3. But it takes time to plan and execute a major water scheme, and insome areas where new towns and town expansions are proposed, and where heavynatural increase of the population is likely, the present sources of supply arestrained. In some water catchment areas too, different big expansions are competingfor the same water supplies. This will affect the timing of some schemes, and maymean that, at any rate over a given period, the pace of growth at one town maybe influenced by the rate of development at another. It might indeed provedesirable to defer the start of some until water supplies have been improved.A1.4. These questions are, of course, inter-dependent on other factors whichmay govern the target for expansion and the speed of development at any givenplace, and the availability of water will be one of the matters for detailed investigation at each place. But certain problem areas stand out.A1.5. Natural increase alone will produce problems in South Essex andwould, in time, require expensive schemes to bring more water into the area. Thefurther increases considered in the Study, both of commuters and in planned expansion schemes (e.g., Chelmsford, Colchester and Southend) will make theprovision of more water an urgent matter. This might be done through a tunnelpassing water from the Thames catchment to Essex. There is already one suchtunnel-it cost  5 million to build but it may not have sufficient capacity to meet all the demands expected in Essex by 1981.A1.6. The situation in Kent is similar. Here too there will be a large natural increase, and expansion at Ashford and Maidstone will make the problem more urgent. The solution might be the exploitation of the resources of the River MedwayBasin, or perhaps ultimately another tunnel from the Thames.A1.7. The other area of difficulty is the Great Ouse and Nene water areas.Four expansion schemes which might be among the largest (Bletchley,Northampton, Peterborough and Stansted) may have to look to these areas fortheir supplies. There may be enough water available locally, but expensive schemesmight be required to obtain this. Expansion at Stansted, unless it were designedto drain northwards to the Great Ouse basin, might have unfortunate effects on existing water supplies from the River Lee.A1.8. The Thames Basin is likely to be the key to water supply in the region.On present population estimates it should be able to meet all demands made on it up to 1981. Thereafter, it may be that the flow in the Thames will have to be augmented by bringing water from other catchments to the west. This would bea direct result of the total population increase in the region, and not of theparticular distribution of that population suggested in the Study.A1.9. The size and urgency of the problems in the South-East are such that a preliminary investigation of the possibilities of various major regional waterschemes should be set on foot at once. This could be one of the first problems towhich the Water Resources Board (to be established under the Water ResourcesAct, 1963) will wish to turn its attention.A1.10. A fuller analysis of the water supply problem in the South-East isgiven in the following paragraphs.
Pghe Water Supply StudyAl.ll. The area included in the water supply investigation is not quite thesame as that of the planning study, for physical and hydrological reasons.Northamptonshire and the Soke of Peterborough are included and Dorset isomitted. Otherwise the boundaries are generally conterminous.A1.12. The area is bounded on the landward side by the NorthamptonUplands, the Cotswolds, the Berkshire Downs, the Hampshire Downs, SalisburyPlain and Cranborne Chase, and on the seaward side by the North Sea, the Straitof Dover and the English Channel. Apart from the low coastal belts in the Fensand in Hampshire, the relatively high ridge boundary is interrupted by the ThamesValley in the Vale of White Horse and in the Kennet Valley.A1.13. The principal river systems are those of the Nene, the Great Ouse andthe Thames; and there are some relatively small river systems discharging to thesea around the coastline.A1.14. The sedimentary geological formations in the area range from theLower Lias of the Jurassic to the Norwich Crag of the Pleistocene measures. Theprincipal measures of importance to underground water supplies are the Chalk and lower Greensand and the Oolitic Limestones. Many useful supplies are alsoobtained from other pervious formations, although in much smaller quantities.A1.15. At the end of 1963 there were 130 water undertakings in the area, ofwhich 81 were local authorities, 19 water boards and 30 water companies. this number will continue to be reduced by amalgamations and regroupings. There are10 river or catchment boards in the area who will, in due course, be superseded nine river authorities to be established under the Water Resources Act, 1963.Present ConditionsA1.16. The basis for ascertaining present conditions was the information contained in returns for 1961 made to the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment by statutory water undertakings.A1.17. In that year, the population in the area which was directly suppliedwas about 18 million. This population was supplied with 909 million gallons per day of which 615 were unmetered (domestic) and 294 were metered (trade, etc.).This total figure is equivalent to 50.3 gallons per head per day.A1.18. The area is supplied with water from surface sources and fromunderground sources in the Chalk, Lower Greensand, the Oolites and lesser supplies from other pervious strata. In 1961, of the total of 909 million gallons per daysupplied, 433 were from underground sources and 470 from surface supplies, thebalance being accounted for by bulk supplies. Of 470 million gallons per dayobtained from surface supplies, 306 million gallons per day were obtained by theMetropolitan Water Board from their intakes in the rivers Thames and Lee. Thenext largest surface water supplies were 34 million gallons daily from the RiverStour for the South Essex Waterworks Company.A 1.19. Surface supplies generally are either by direct abstraction of rawwater from the river or by pumped storage. Upland impounded supplies are rarein the South-East, the only example of note being the impounding reservoirs inthe Nene catchment of the Mid-Northamptonshire Water Board.Future ConditionsA1.20. It is estimated in the planning study that the population of South-east england will increase by 3-5 million by 1981 of which U- million would be accomodated in new and expanded towns.A1.21. In the water supply study, consideration has to be given to the waterdemands for the whole increase in population of 3-5 million, in addition to the increasing demands of the present population. The provision made for plannedexpansions of H million is only a part of the whole problem.A1.22. The demand for water per head of population is showing a tendency to increase considerably because of the introduction of domestic appliances suchas washing machines, the provision of waterborne sanitation and fixed baths inmore private houses, the general raising of the levels of standards of personal
hygiene, the more general use of inexpensive hoses and sprayers for gardeiiwatering and the development of spray irrigation for agricultural purposes. a statistical examination of trends in the past, as far as comprehensive records areavailable, shows that for England and Wales as a whole, if present trends continue,the demand per head per day, including both domestic and trade supplies, mayby 1981 have increased from the present 50-4 gallons per head per day to at least65 gallons per head per day. This figure does not include industrial and other supplies drawn from privately-owned sources.A1.23. On the basis of these figures and the expected population increase,the 1961 consumption of 909 million gallons daily will rise by 1981 to 1,372 million gallons daily and as the reliable yields of existing headworks and sources are littlemore than adequate to meet present demands, further developments will benecessary to produce the additional 463 million gallons daily.Availability of WaterA1.24. The area has been divided into eight units which correspondapproximately to the hydrometric areas used by the Surface Water Survey unit of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. In some cases those areas have been grouped together.A1.25. It must be emphasised that the schemes outlined below are merelysuggestions put forward as a possible means of meeting the demand, and their finaladoption must depend upon the results of considerable exploratory work, theconsideration of other interests such as agricultural use of land, riparian interestsand the interest of other water users, and the obtaining of the necessary powers toenable them to be carried out. The Minister of Housing and Local Governmentis in no way committed to any of the schemes.A1.26. Until it is known with more certainty which of the planned expansion schemes will go forward, it is not possible to go into the water schemes in any detail and the pattern and timing of the rate of building development will influence theirphasing. Up to 10 years may elapse between the first inception of a scheme involvingmajor works and the time when it first produces water in useful quantities.East AngliaA 1.27. In this area there is a surplus of underground water in the Chalk andsome supplies can be made available by utilising surface water from reservoirs ofthe pumped storage type. The balance of surface and ground water should beintegrated to make the best use of each.A1.28. The construction of a barrage at Great Yarmouth to exclude sea waterfrom the Rivers Bure and Yare could produce a considerable quantity of water butit would interfere with other interests and, at this stage, it can be considered as no more than a possibility.Nene and Great OuseA1.29. It is doubtful if there would be sufficient ground water reserves to meet any large additional demands in the Nene catchment area but surface water mightbe exploited in limited quantities by the use of pumped storage such as may beavailable in the disused clay pits in the Peterborough area.A1.30. The surface water resources of the Great Ouse Basin are already being exploited and works are now in progress for the construction of a pumped storagereservoir at Diddington and trunk mains for distribution. This first phase shouldbe producing water by 1967 and later phases are timed to be completed before 1990.A later phase of the Great Ouse scheme, which cannot, however, be started for someyears to come, and for which powers have not yet been obtained, would include anintake at Kempston, near Bedford, and would use pumped storage in disused claypits near Bedford. Surface water resources might be augmented by using somesmaller and less economical sites for reservoirs, but these proposals would probablyfully develop the available surface water resources of the Great Ouse Valley. Withthe accelerated building development proposed in the Great Ouse Valley and in theareas served by the Great Ouse scheme which are dependent upon it for water supplies, it is probable that the development of the Great Ouse Water Supply schemeto its ultimate capacity will have to be accelerated considerably.
vip A 1.31. There are large reserves of water in the Chalk on the eastern side ofme Great Ouse Basin. This Chalk is in a belt extending from an area east of king&apos;s Lynn to the neighbourhood of Cambridge. The resources of this Chalk belthave not been fully explored as a whole and the ability of the Chalk to yield up itsstored water has not been fully proved. It is, however, regarded as a potential source of future supplies, some of which may well be available for export to other areas such as the Lee Basin and north Essex.EssexA 1.32. In the planning study several large and important developments aresuggested in Essex, an area in which the unexploited resources of both ground and surface water are extremely limited. It will be necessary to import water fromother areas to meet the large demands for major expansions and development inEssex.A1.33. For supplies in north Essex, additional water could be drawn fromSuffolk and East Anglia, and from the Chalk in the Great Ouse Basin. TheMetropolitan Water Board have completed the Thames-Lee Tunnel main whichis to convey untreated Thames water from Hampton to the Lee Valley in eastLondon and an arrangement already exists for supplying a considerable quantityof this water into south Essex. To increase this supply the discharge capacity ofthe Thames-Lee Tunnel could be augmented and ultimately it may be necessaryto duplicate the tunnel. There is a potential site for a reservoir for storage ofThames water on the Cobbins Brook in the Lee Basin, which could be used for supplies to south Essex.The Lee BasinA 1.34. This is a critical area, as it contains the new towns of Harlow andStevenage and places in Hertfordshire which would be affected by the spread ofcommuter population from London.A1.35. No major additional abstraction of ground water can be relied upon in the future and the surface water resources are already more than fully exploited.Therefore, to meet the large development expected in this area, water will haveto be imported from outside the basin. This could be done by importation of ground and surface water from the Great Ouse Basin and by water from the thames catchment.KentA1.36. There are certain ground water reserves in east Kent and with proper regulation of the flows in the rivers, particular the Medway, the localresources may be able to meet the expected demands for some years to come.However, if the developments in mid and south Kent envisaged in the planningstudy materialise, it is unlikely that local water resources will prove to be adequate. In the long term, the supplies in north Kent could be augmented byThames water, possibly conveyed into the area by a tunnel like the Thames-LeeTunnel.ThamesA1.37. The Thames Basin is the most important unit in the system of water supplies for South-East England. In addition to the many important suppliesgiven within the basin, both of ground and surface water, most of which isreturned to the River Thames in the form of sewage effluents, the river forms thelifeline of surface water supplies to the London area and, in the future, may wellserve to augment local supplies in south Essex and north Kent.A1.38. In addition to natural increases in population in the basin, majorplanned developments may take place at Aylesbury, Banbury, Reading andSwindon as well as a big new town in the Newbury area.A1.39. The water resources of the Thames Basin should be sufficient tosupport supplies to the future population within the upper basin, most of thewater so used being returned to the river for re-use.
A1.40. Water flowing in the Thames channel above Teddington Lock &amp;abstracted during the wetter periods of the year and stored for use in the drierperiods and by this method supplies are maintained throughout the year to thepopulation needing them. This method is being extended by the MetropolitanWater Board by the construction of more storage reservoirs in the ThamesValley and they have had under consideration the construction of morereservoirs in the Thames Basin. The possibility has also been considered ofutilising the underground storage available in the Chalk and Oolites under the thames Basin and augmenting the flow in the Thames channel in dry periods bypumping into it water from underground. By such means as these, the wateravailable in the Thames catchment area could be utilised to the full.A 1.41. There are further possibilities of augmenting the flow in the Thameswhich may well merit consideration either as additional or as alternative measures.One is that water might be pumped northwards from the basins of the RiversAvon and Stour in Hampshire to discharge into the Kennet. Another suggestionis that water might be pumped into the upper reaches of the Thames from further west.A1.42. It is therefore considered that the Thames, possibly augmented byimportation of water from neighbouring catchment areas, should be capable of meeting the demands for the Thames Basin, London and the areas of south Essexand north Kent for many years to come.A 1.43. Development of the potentialities of the Thames would entail majorengineering work such - as the construction of large storage reservoirs, the exploration and construction of numerous boreholes for the abstraction of ground water to augment the river flows, the possible duplication of the Thames-Lee tunnel for conveying Thames water into south Essex and a similar tunnelfor conveying water into north Kent.SussexA. 1.44. Where rivers are fed from chalk springs, the ground and surfacewaters are interdependent, and for optimum exploitation, must be developed as one. There are reserves of ground water in the county especially in the chalk ofthe South Downs and surface water in the rivers is capable of development ifadequate storage can be provided.A1.45. There need be no great anxiety about water supplies in Sussex, ifthe exploitation of ground and surface resources is properly co-ordinated.HampshireA1.46. The principal planned expansion suggested in Hampshire is in theSouthampton-Portsmouth area. The main sources of water supplies are the Chalkfor ground water and direct abstractions from rivers. Southampton draws supplies from both, but Portsmouth relies mainly upon the Chalk. The rivers are mainlychalk-fed so that the ground and surface water cannot be treated independently;large-scale exploitation of the ground water may affect the flow in the rivers.The effect of this on fishing, particularly in the Itchen and the Test, will need tobe considered.A 1.47. It is probable that large-scale exploitation of the water reserves would be from the rivers. This would entail providing adequate storage to regulate the flow, when suitable sites can be found. In general, storage sites as far downstreamas possible and near to the tidal waters would probably be least open to objectionfrom the point of view of riparian interests.A1.48. Poole, in Dorset, is included in the towns proposed for development.This area depends at present upon ground water for its supplies and there is alimited reserve of water which could be exploited. If this proves inadequate,consideration could be given to the development of river supplies in theneighbourhood, provided suitable storage sites could be found.Capital InvestmentA 1.49. At the present stage of the development proposals for South-east england it is very difficult to estimate what will be the total capital cost of watersupply. This is largely due to unavoidably incomplete knowledge of the finallocation of the future centres of population and the phasing of major schemes which will be necessary.
Wr: A 1.50. Approximate broad and comprehensive figures are suggested, basedupon major works which have been or are being carried out in the post-war period and adjusted to give some indication of present-day costs. These include headworksand treatment works for major schemes and what is thought to be a reasonableallowance for trunk mains for conveying water from sources to the points fromwhich supplies would be distributed. No allowance is made in these figures for distribution systems within the towns.A1.51. On that basis the cost of major water supply schemes for an additionalpopulation of 3^ million would be of the order of  65 million. This figure canonly be taken as a broad indication of the order of the capital cost involved.No indication of the probable phasing of expenditure can be attempted at present.ConclusionA1.52. To provide for the expected increase in population in South-east england over the next 20 years it will be necessary to develop a number of major new water supply schemes. This will call for careful co-ordination on a much larger scale than has been necessary in the past, not only to provide for the delivery of additional water into areas with inadequate local resources, but to ensure thatavailable resources are exploited to the best advantage and that the phasing ofthe programme of exploitation is geared to the pattern of increasing demand for water.A1.53. In the next decade, water undertakings will be faced with increasing demands for water both from the increase in demand per capita and from increasing population and industry. They will undoubtedly have to develop fullytheir existing sources of supply and seek to exploit many local potential sources.At the same time and in parallel with this, the authorities responsible for waterconservation and the allocation of available water resources will need to considerthe major schemes, such as those involving the transference of water between thevarious river basins. In addition to this, exploratory and preparatory work shouldbe carried out as soon as possible to prove the practicability of certain of the major schemes which will become necessary in the not very distant future.A 1.54. As a general guide, it is suggested that the following steps might betaken:(i) A more detailed investigation of the suitability of sites for storageof surface water in East Anglia than was possible by the SurfaceWater Survey.(ii) Consideration of the possibility of accelerating the present programmeof the Great Ouse Water Authority and the possibility of developing the Kempston Intake and the Stewartby storage scheme at an earlier date than was expected.(iii) The field exploration of the potentialities of the Chalk in the GreatOuse Basin, by the appropriate authority.(iv) The immediate acceleration of all projects for full development ofall the available resources in Essex. This should include thepossibility of augmenting the present arrangement for the supplyof Thames water in south Essex and the possible need for additional storage for this purpose.(v) The immediate acceleration of a more detailed field exploration ofthe available sites for regulating and pumped storage reservoirs in kent, especially on the Medway, any necessary further explorationof the Chalk reserves and the elimination of saline contaminationin the mining areas.(vi) Proposals for seeking additional storage sites in the Thames Valleyand for exploring the possibilities of exploiting the undergroundstorage in the Thames Basin should be encouraged.(vii) The possibilities of further connections between the Thames andLee basins and of such a connection between the Thamescatchment area and the area of the Kent river board should beconsidered.(viii) Transfers of water into the Thames catchment area from the west and south should be given preliminary investigation,(ix) A start should be made on detailed exploratory work for exploitingthe ground and surface water resources of Hampshire, in particular the field exploration of sites for regulating or pumped storagereservoir sites for surface water.
APPENDIX 2TABLES1. This Appendix brings together some of the detailed material on which the argument in the text is based. Most of the tables are related to figures in the text.2. The tables are divided into three main sections. The first section contains the definitions of the major divisions of England and Wales and the subdivisionsof South-East England used in the Study; the second deals with population; andthe third with employment.I. Definition of Areas3. For the purposes of the Study five major divisions of England and wales have been defined; and South-East England has been further subdivided. Thesetables give the composition and the estimated civilian populations of each of these divisions in 1961.4. Table 1 gives the composition of the five major divisions of England andWales used in the Study (see Fig. 2).5. These major divisions are, with one exception, made up of the standardregions defined by the Registrar-General for the 1961 census. The only departure from standard regional boundaries is Dorset, the whole of which is included inthe South-East as defined in the Study. (For comparison with the regionalboundaries used by other Government Departments, see footnotes 1 and 2 toTable 1.)6. Table 2 shows the subdivisions of South-East England used in the Study,and Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 give the composition of them (see Fig. 3).7. The main subdivisions of the South-East are the Greater Londonconurbation, as defined for the 1961 census, which comprises the built-up area ofLondon lying inside the metropolitan green belt (Table 3); and the metropolitan region, which is the area within about 40 miles of the centre of London, wherethe influence of London is most strongly felt. The outer metropolitan region (i.e.,that part of the metropolitan region that falls outside the conurbation) has been further divided into two rings the inner country ring (Table 4) and the outercountry ring (Table 5).n

Population StatisticsPopulation Distribution and Changes8. The chief source of population statistics is the census, which has beenheld every 10 years (with the exception of 1941) since 1801. The Registrar-GeneraPspublished estimates of Home Population, based on the Census, include, however,members of the British Commonwealth and foreign armed forces in the area, andit is more appropriate for the purposes of land use planning to use his speciallyprepared mid-year estimates of civilian population.9. Table 7 shows the distribution of population in 1951 and 1961 and the changes occurring between these dates, principally by natural change andmigration. These changes are illustrated in Figs. 4, 5 and 6.10. Table 8 shows the growth of the population of South-East Englandsince 1801, and how the area&apos;s percentage share of the total population of Englandand Wales has varied.11. Table 9 deals with changes in population distribution within themetropolitan region. It shows how, in a cross-section of the region from Readingto Southend, the balance of population has shifted both within the conurbationand between the conurbation and the outer metropolitan region over the period1901-61. These changes are shown in Fig. 15.The Birth Rate12. Table 10 gives the number of live births recorded in each year from 1946to 1962 in England and Wales as a whole and in the divisions of South-east england. For each area, the post-war low is shown in heavy type. The Table alsogives the figures for each area on a ratio basis related to 1955 which was the lowpoint for the birth rate trend in England and Wales as a whole. These changes intrend are illustrated in Fig. 7, and the birth rate trend for England and Wales asa whole over the period is shown in Fig. 8.m

The figures are for civilian population only and allowance has, therefore, to be made for reduction in the size of the armed forces over the period.In the absence of information on the destinations of demobilised personnel, the net gain to the civilian population of the country as a whole from this source hasbeen allocated to areas (column 8) pro rata to their 1951 populations.2. The estimates of net migration (column 9) have been calculated by deducting from the total change (column 4) the estimates of natural change (column 6)and the allowances made for gains from the armed forces (column 8).

xisting Planned Overspill Schemes13. Tables 11 and 12 deal with the provision already made under the new towns Act 1946 and the Town Development Act 1952 for the housing of overspillpopulation from local authority areas in London which have been recognised asexporting areas for the purposes of Section 9 of the Housing Subsidies Act 1956.The major schemes are shown in Fig. 14.14. One purpose of the Tables is to show the remaining capacity in existing schemes in 1961 as a basis for calculating how much of London&apos;s future overspillwill remain to be dealt with elsewhere (Chapter 10, paragraph 19). For this purpose,schemes which have been agreed since 1961 are relevant, and capacity to be provided in them has been shown as existing in 1961, which is the base date for the overspillcalculation.15. Table 13 compares the age-structure of the population of the Londonnew towns in 1961 with that of England and Wales as a whole. This comparison is illustrated in Fig. 24.

This table relates only to the planned population growth in the development period of the new towns, during which they are administered by development corporations. In the second stage of the development of the existing new towns there will be no further planned inward movements from London although the population will continue to grow, mainly by natural increase. Crawley and Hemel Hempstead have now reached this stage and the assets of the development corporation were transferred to the Commission for the New Towns on 1st April, 1962.2. The Bracknell designated area has been extended since mid-1961 thus enabling the population at which planned growth is expected to cease (column 5) to beraised from 40,000 to 50,000. The figure in column 7 therefore represents the difference between 50,000 and the estimated population at mid-1961.RECEPTION CAPACITY IN EXISTING NEW TOWNSMID-1961

The eight London new towns are listed in Table 11.2. The age structure of their population (column 2) is based on the 1961 Census enumeratedpopulation. The figures for England and Wales (column 4) are the Registrar-GeneraFs estimates forthe civilian population as at 30th June, 1961.III. Employment Statistics: Areas16. The geographical divisions of England and Wales and of South-east england used in the Study (Tables 1-6) are made up of local authority areas. Someboundaries of Ministry of Labour local office areas (which are the basic units for employment data) do not correspond with those of local authority areas and the divisions in the Tables relating to employment therefore differ slightly from the divisions used in the population Tables.17. Two of the major divisions Midlands and Northern England were affected by changes in Ministry of Labour regional boundaries made in 1962 whenthree regions Midland, North Midlands and East and West Ridings werecombined to form two new regions Midlands, and Yorkshire and Lancashire. Thefigures used here are for the regions as constituted up to 1962.18. For most of the Tables the figures for South-East and South-WestEngland have been adjusted so as to include in the South-East the part of Dorset(i.e., the whole of the county except Poole) which falls in Ministry of Labour South-Western Region. In Tables 16, 19, 20 and 23, however, South-East England doesnot include the whole of Dorset.
0)ipe of the Statistics19. The employment statistics are derived from the Ministry of Labour&apos;annual (June) estimates of employees (employed and unemployed). For GreatBritain as a whole these estimates account for 92 per cent of the total working population (i.e., people of working age who either work for pay or gain or whoregister themselves as available for such work). The balance is made up . ofemployers and people working on their own account (6 per cent) and members ofHer Majesty&apos;s Forces and Women&apos;s Services (2 per cent).Industrial Classification20. In some Tables the total number of employees is analysed by groups toprovide a picture of the structure of employment.21. The Standard Industrial Classification, issued by the Central StatisticalOffice in 1958* groups industries in 24 Orders. The classification is based onindustries and not on occupations, and administrative, technical, clerical and ancillary staff are included in the figures of employment for the industry concerned.Thus the head office of a firm operating in the United Kingdom is classified as faras possible according to the major activity of the firm.22. These Orders are further sub-divided into Minimum List Headings; theparticular industries included under each heading are set out in the StandardIndustrial Classification. In most of the tables dealing with employment structurethe analysis is in terms of either Orders or Minimum List Headings, but for some general tables the Orders have been grouped, for the purpose of the Study, into three broad categories Primary, Manufacturing and Service Industries. the composition of these categories is shown in Table 16.Periods Covered23. Detailed employment statistics cannot be produced on a comparablebasis for the period taken for population statistics, 1951-61. A broad regionalanalysis of changes in the distribution of employees for the period 1952-62 has been specially prepared by the Ministry of Labour and is given in Table 14. In general,however, comparable employment statistics are not available for years earlier than1955 because the figures before that date are not corrected for &quot; bulk exchanges&quot;i.e., to allow for the fact that some large firms may exchange the national insurancecards of some of their employees in a region other than that in which they work.Regional analysis of employment on a comparable basis is, therefore, possible only for the period 1955-62 and this is the method adopted in Table 15.24. Changes in classification were introduced when the Standard IndustrialClassification was revised in 1958; for this reason most of the tables analysingemployment structure cover the period 1959-62 only. In Table 18 figures for thethree broad categories have been compiled for an earlier period 1955-58 on thebasis of the 1948 Edition of the Standard Industrial Classification. These figures,however, are not fully comparable with those given for 1959-62.Number and Distribution of Employees25. Table 14 shows the distribution of employees, by major divisions ofEngland and Wales, in 1952 and 1962, and the changes that took place between thesedates. These figures for a 10-year period have been specially prepared by theMinistry of Labour; figures are not available for the subdivisions of South-east england used in the Study.26. Table 15 is a similar analysis for the period 1955-62. Comparable figuresof total employees are available over this period, and figures are given for thesubdivisions of South-East England (see Fig. 9).Industrial Structure27. Table 16 lists the 24 Industrial Orders in the three broad categories usedin the Study and shows how the structure of employment in South-East england in 1962 differed from the structure for England and Wales as a whole. The Tablealso indicates the changes in the numbers in employment in each Industrial Order* Standard Industrial Classification, 1958. Consolidated edition, 1963, H.M.S.O., Price 2s 6d.CONFIDENTIAL3878 L 2
in Great Britain over the period 1952-62. These figures have been specially provi^f)by the Ministry of Labour; no breakdown for the subdivisions of South-east england is available in terms of Industrial Orders.28. Table 17 is an analysis of employment structure in 1962 in terms of thethree broad categories only, but with a breakdown for the subdivisions of South-east england. The differences in structure are illustrated in Fig. 11.29. Table 18 illustrates the differential changes that have taken place in thedistribution of employment in the three broad categories in each of the divisions and subdivisions of the country. The anaysis covers two three-year periods 1955-58and 1959-62. No estimates of change are available for the year 1958-59 duringwhich changes in classification were introduced.30. Table 19 is based on an analysis of the changes in the numbers employedin each of the 24 Industrial Orders in Great Britain as a whole over the period1952-62.31. Table 20 is based on a similar analysis, relating only to manufacturing industries, and in terms of Minimum List Headings, not Industrial Orders. Forthis more detailed analysis the standard of comparison has to be the comparatively short period, 1959-62, and not the 10-year period used in Table 19 (see Fig. 10).32. Table 21 sets out the industries (in terms of Minimum List Headings)which have had employment increases of over 3,000 in South-East England in theperiod 1959-62. Table 22 contains a similar analysis for the London conurbationonly.Table 14CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF EMPLOYEESENGLAND AND WALES1952-62(Thousands)	* Distribution		Change		Distribution		1952		1952-62		1962	Area							No.	Per cent	No.	Per cent	No.	Per cent(1)	(2)	(3) -	(4)	(5)	(6)	(7)England and Wales......	18,684	100 0	1,933	10-3	20,617	100 south-East England	7,262	38-9	1,083	14-9	8,345	40-5Midlands.........	3,435	18-4	426	12-4	3,861	18-south-West England	1,072	5-7	143	13-3	1,215	5-northern England	5,981	32-0	240	4-0	6,221	30-2Wales      ......      ...	934	5-0	41	4-4	975	4-7

Examples of &quot; other miscellaneous services &quot; are service of Commonwealth and foreign governments and international organisations; trade associations and tradeunions; business services; head offices of firms operating abroad; and head offices of firms which are concerned with more than one activity and which cannot, therefore,be classified in any other heading.INDUSTRIES WITH INCREASES IN EMPLOYMENT OF 3,000 OR MORE
Factory and Office Building33. Table 23 gives figures of industrial buildings completed in the years1952-61 (inclusive) and the estimated employment provided, in each of the majordivisions of England and Wales and of South-East England (see Fig. 12).34. These figures are based on information available to the Board of trade as a result of applications for industrial development certificates. They relate tocompleted buildings known to the Board of Trade by 30th June, 1963. Theestimates of employment provided are those accepted when the applications were decided. They relate only to labour requirements which could be attributed to theproposed building or extension itself.35. The Table also relates the estimated employment provided in each area to its total insured population in 1952; no figures are available for the sub-divisions of South-East England, except for the London conurbation.36. Table 24 illustrates the growth in office floor space in central London(see Fig. 17).37. The estimates of office floor space have been provided by the LondonCounty Council; they relate to buildings for which the principal use is offices,for the purposes of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1963(S.I. 1963 No. 708). The Table also includes the Councils estimates of further commitments.

In this table South East England is defined in terms of Board of Trade (cols. 2-5) or Ministry of Labour (col. 6) regions, and does not include Dorset.2 The statistics of industrial building relate only to those new buildings and extensions for which Board of Trade locational approval has had to be obtained. Inrespect of such schemes approved up to 31st March, 1960, only those completed projects which involved more than 5,000 sq. ft. of floor space and which were forapplicants engaged in the manufacturing industries have been included. All completed projects for which approvals were given since that date are included. In thesecases the figures cover only those parts of buildings for which an Industrial Development Certificate, as provided for in the Local Employment Act, 1960, was required.
