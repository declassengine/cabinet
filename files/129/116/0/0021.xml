CONFIDENTIAL(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. P. (64) 2122nd January, 1964THE SCHOOL.LEAVING AGSMemorandutai by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster-General and the Minister of EducationWe were asked to prepare a memorandum describing the implications-tions of a decision to raise the school leaving age to 16 from 1969, 1970,1971 and 1972 respectively,2.     Definitions.   In this memorandum references to raising the again a particular year mean that that is the year in which the first pupilsaccepted will be actually starting their extra year at school.    Forexample, raising the age in 1970 means bringing the change into effect in the school year 1969-70 so that (in England and Wales) the firstpupils affected will have their extra year from Easter 1970 to Easter1971.    The need for additional accommodation will not, however, ariseuntil September, since the 11-year old age group is admitted to secondary schools only once a year, in September.3,     All figures include Scotland and are at March, 1963 prices.Current Expenditure. As explained in the Annex to C.P, (64) 1,the theoretical additional current educational expenditure is estimated at 65 million per annum.      This however includes  33. 5 million for teachers&apos; salaries, which would be incurred in the years under con-sideration only to the extent that additional teachers were somehowbrought into the schools in those years as a result of raising the age.The actual increase in current educational expenditure, starting in thefinancial year in which the age is raised, would therefore fall between a minimum of  31, 5 million and a maximum of  65 million;  inC,P. (64) 1 it was put at  45 million.    Non-educational costs (due to theeffect on income tax, family allowances and national insurance) are put at between  30 million and  35 million a year.    These figures are not affected by the date chosen,5.     Capital Sx^endjtnrgj    As explained in paragraph (b) of the annex to C. P. (64) 1 capital expenditure of  115 million is required for buildingv/ork.    Including sites, fees and equipment the total approaches 150 million.    The size of school building programmes has not been settled beyond 1967.    Provision for increases in school population andfor movements of population cannot be avoided.    This will take upabout two-thirds of the building programmes for 1965-67;  the remainingone-third will be for improvements.    The view of the Minister of-1-copy no.   . 58CABINET
Education is that a continuation of at least the present rate of schoolimprovement is highly desirable, but that if, and only if, the school leaving age is to be raised it would be defensible to make a substantial reduction to help accommodate the capital cost of raising the age.The Chief Secretary&apos;s view is that either the &quot;improvements&quot; arenecessary, in which case it would not be possible to forego them inorder to accommodate raising the school age, or they are not necessary, in which case it is not to be assumed that it would in any event have been possible to include them in building programme s ata time when pressure on resources will be very highj and that there-fore it is not possible to claim the saving from not doing this as a realset-off against the cost of raising the school leaving age.    In his view the extra capital costs in the three years preceding raising the agemust be regarded as of the order of  150 million.6,      On the Minister of Education&apos;s assumption that part of thecapital cost can be met by deferring improvements to schools,additional building starts of  20 million,  20 million and  10 million,beginning two clear years before the school leaving age was raised,would be required.    The resulting capital expenditure (includingbuilding work, sites, fees and equipment) would be phased as in the table below: -Year of   millionraisingfee-age     1967-68  19SC-S9  1969-70  1970-71   1971-72  1972-73  Total1969 8             19           37 641970 8          19 37 641971 8 19 37                         641972 8 19 37           647.     On the Chief Secretary&apos;s view that pressure of other claims on resources at the time might be such that it would in any event have been necessary to defer such school improvements, the additional capital cost of raising the school leaving age would be not  64 million but about 150 million, and the figures in the table above would read as follows:-Year of   millionraisingthe&quot;age     1967-68  1968-69  1969-70  1970-71   1971-72  1972-73  Total1969 19            44           87 1501970 19           44 87 1501971 19 44 87                        1501972 19 44 87          1508.     GrpwtK-pf other public expenditure during the period.    Thememorandum CP. (64) 19 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theChief Secretary to the Treasury shows that expenditure on all the major programmes is likely to be rising rapidly in the late 1960s.    Inparticular there will be pressure as a result of the Buchanan report and regional redevelopment to increase investment in roads even more-2-
rapidly man at present; we are already committed to an ultimatetotal of 400, 000 houses annually, and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government has proposed that this target shall be increasedto 500, 000.    Defence expenditure is likely to increase rapidly in thelate 1960s when the bulk of the cost of the new aircraft carrier will fall to be met and we may be expected to provide a new generation of aircraft.    Expenditure on the Concord will also be at a peak at this time.    In the field of Health there is already great pressure on theannual growth rate of 2j per cent in current expenditure and thecapital programmes will not begin to flatten off ttntil   1970 or later.The bulk of the cost of the Channel Tunnel, if it were approved, wouldbe likely to fall in the two years 1968-70.9.     In the Chief Secretary&apos;s view it is clear from the above thatthe pressure on public expenditure will be such that it will beimpossible to find room in any event for the additional expenditure involved in raising the school leaving age, unless at the same timecuts are decided on in other proposals; and that in view of thedifficulty involved in making cuts that will take substantial effectbefore 1972, the difficulty in raising the age would be accentuatedeven further by the choice of any earlier date.J.A.
