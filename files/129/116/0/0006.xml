THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;69CP. (64) 6 COPY NO. ^_^3rd January, 1964CABINETCOMMONWEALTH policy memorandum by the Prime minister the Cabinet will remember that in paragraph 3 of The Queenrsspeech we stated: -&quot;They believe that the Commonwealth has a significant part to play in ensuring stability and peace in the world, andthey will continue to take all possible steps to strengthen the links between the governments and peoples of theCommonwealth.    In their effort to expand world trade my Government will continue to attach great importanceto the maintenance and development of commerce between commonwealth countries. &quot;As yet we could be charged with having given too little indication of what we propose to do to carry out that declaration of purpose which,incidentally, was very well received by many of our most loyalsupporters in the Party.    I sense that we shall be hard pressed by theOpposition and our own supporters in the debate on commonwealth trade on 15th January unless we can say something positive.2. I set out below the various suggestions which have beencanvassed: -(1)  We might announce a decision to test out commonwealth governments again on the proposal for a Commonwealth economic development Council.    Such a Council could be organised on the linesof our own National Economic Development Council.    Its tasks mightbe:-(a) to examine the economic performance of members;(b) to consider obstacles to quicker growth; whetherthe best uses of resources are being made;  andwhether members can help one another more;(c) if so requested, to consider national development plans;  whether any co-ordination is possible;whether aid and technical assistance is beingeffi ciently deployed;(d) to promote common policies with regard, forexample, to:-(i)  security of investment;(ii)  currency problems.
It is true that the Commonwealth Economic Conference at montreal turned down the idea of machinery on the economic sidewhich was more than advisory.    But the N. E.D. C. has stimulatedwidespread interest and the new initiative might now receive morebacking.The Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; Meeting must havehad some such idea when they said in September:-&quot;The Council considered a proposal that a more systematicstudy of world economic trends in general and those ofthe Commonwealth in particular would enable them to appreciate more fully each other&apos;s economic problems and prospects, particularly those of the developing countries.    It was suggested that a collation of theeconomic and trade prospects of individual countries and of their development plans would throw light onthe future pattern of demand for, and supply of,primary products and manufactured goods within theCommonwealth, and might well reveal new opportunities for the expansion of Commonwealth trade on a mutuallysatisfactory basis within the existing world trade system.It was agreed that this proposal should be examined further. 11The Commonwealth Economic Committee exists but it dealsbroadly in statistics and a standing body with a more active rolemight supplant, or be added to, it.(2)  We could take an immediate initiative in calling for aconference of finance and/or economic planning Ministers todiscuss the attitudes that Commonwealth Governments should takeat the United Nations Trade and Development Conference whichstarts at the end of March.    And to the &apos;2 ennedy Round&apos; which comes a little later.    Topics which might be discussed are:-(a) treatment of exports of developing countries;(b) the effects of the present GATT regulations upondeveloping countries;(c) possibilities with regard to price stabilisation schemes and long-term bulk agreements;(d) possibilities as to &apos;agreed specialisation&apos; by developing countries;(e) attitude to the &quot;Kennedy Round&apos;.&apos; The Conference could agree to set up working parties todiscuss some of the above topics. Out of this some permanent machinery might grow.-2-
(3) A decision could be taken to set up a CommonwealthExport Council to cover those countries of the Commonwealth not within the scope of existing export councils.    We still export over 1,200 million worth of goods a year to Commonwealth countries,but in spite of their increased trade our share of their total importshas been steadily falling and seems likely to continue so to do.Canada and the Caribbean are already covered by the We sternHemisphere Exports Council;  Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar arenow covered by the Export Council for Europe.    A third exportcouncil could be- set up with three sub-committees - one for theIndian sub-continent, another for the Far Eastern commonwealth countries, including Malaysia, and a third for Africa.    I see the objection which can be made to such a proposal, but even if itfailed we should have been seen to have tried.3. In the information and cultural field, the following suggestions have been put to me by the Commonwealth Secretary: -(a) the expansion of information and British Council work;(b) an increase in the number of volunteers to be sent abroad under the Voluntary Service OverseasScheme;(c) better provision for Commonwealth students in Britain;(d) arrangements for Commonwealth universities to findplaces for British students;(e) ensuring the success of the Commonwealth ArtsFestival;(f) a new initiative with regard to fairs and exhibitions;(g) an increase in the work of the CommonwealthParliamentary Association.4.     In the financial field, the ideas of a commonwealth development Bank or Fund, a Commonwealth incomes guaranteescheme and a protection for Commonwealth investment have, Ibelieve, received some preliminary consideration by Departments.5.     Lord Casey in his book &apos;The Future of the Commonwealth&apos;has made some suggestions which are a miscellaneous bag butworth consideration:-(a) further development of the work of the CommonwealthScientific Committee;(b) creation of regional Commonwealth universities and technical colleges in Asia, Africa and elsewhere;-3-
(c) strengthening of links between professional associationsin Commonwealth countries, e.g. law, medical,surgical, engineering, arthitecture, accountancy;(d) appointment of senior liaison officers on staffs ofBritish High Commissions;(e) more frequent visits by politicians and journalists;(f) use of documentary films;(g) continuing support for the Commonwealth Games.6.     I have it in mind that many of our supporters are looking for a programme composed of such ideas.    A number of theproposals will be shot down.    I doubt if that matters because the others will do the shooting.    If they take a negative attitude thatis better than that we should do so.    I have it in mind too thatwe shall have much more difficulty in getting into the common market than at one time seemed likely.    We have already made it clear that new Commonwealth arrangements cannot be aneconomic substitute for members ership of the Treaty of Rome butanything gained in the field of Commonwealth trade must beworthwhile.7.     I know that some of these suggestions have been undera.ctive consideration and that much progress has already beenmade on them.    But I would see advantage in trying to get themain issues, particularly those relating to possible trade orecoxaomic initiatives, as clear as possible before the debate on15th January;  and to consider the timing of any approach thatmay be needed to Commonwealth Governments,    I suggest,therefore, that the Cabinet should consider this at their meetingon 9th January.A.
