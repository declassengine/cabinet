Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1964CP. (64) 42 Copy No.    6 311th February, 1964CABINETAGRICULTURAL POLICY: MEATMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the multilateral discussions with our principal overseas meat suppliersadjourned on Friday, 7th February, without it having been possible to reach agreement on the lines which my colleagues had approved (CM. (64) 9tbConclusions, Minute 3). The outstanding points of difference are described in the annex; but the real breaking point came on the most we thought the marketcould reasonably take and the lowest figure the exporters would come down to for their quotas to our market.2. While the gaps for both beef and lamb were only a few thousand tons,I felt unable to authorise officials to go any higher. For beef, the difficulty is thatwe expect only a small increase in production next year and our farmers willoppose a much larger increase in imports. For example, beef imports of380,000 tons would be some 5% per cent higher than in the current financial year,whereas home production is estimated to be only 1 per cent higher. Moreover,total supplies of beef would be up by some 2\ per cent, whereas we regard thegrowth in the market as no more than \\ per cent. Comparisons with the averageof the last two financial years would look much more favourable but theacceptance of such a high figure for total imports would have made it difficult tonegotiate a satisfactory indicator price with the Farmers&apos; Unions.3. For lamb, total supplies including home produced on the basis of our offer to exporters of 360,000 tons would have been 622,000 tons in 1964-65compared with 585,000 tons in the current year and a previous maximum of617,000 tons in 1961-62 when prices were disastrously low. Bearing in mind thevery small natural growth in the lamb market, these figures would at least havemade it very difficult to negotiate a satisfactory indicator price for homeproducers.Should a further attempt be made to negotiate an agreement?4. My colleagues will now wish to decide whether we should accept that weshould have no agreement on meat for 1964-65 or whether they would be preparedto authorise further concessions, particularly in regard to the level of imports, inthe hope that agreement could then be reached.5. In favour of going ahead there is the fact that very small concessions now would probably be sufficient and we could then say that all our major immediateobjectives in this field, as outlined in my speech in the House on 22nd May, 1963,had been achieved. If the opportunity is allowed to slip, it will undoubtedly bemore difficult to negotiate the same terms in a year&apos;s time. Moreover, it will besaid that in the coming year the market will be exposed to greater risks since weshall no longer be able to hold Argentina to the type of arrangement we had thisyear and the restrictions now imposed by the United States Government maydivert Australian and New Zealand beef back to this market. Moreover in theabsence of agreement we could face difficulties in limiting supplies from countrieslike France which are now free of animal health restrictions.3926IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W.1,11th February, 1964.6.  In fact, however, the likelihood is that there will be a shortage of beef^$the coming months with a strong demand continuing in the Continent of Europe.If we do go ahead with an agreement, we shall certainly be blamed for any shortagesand high prices that could occur.7. Moreover, although we would have the support of Mr. Woolley and theEnglish Farmers Union, we know that the Scottish Farmers Union with their great interest in livestock production are strongly opposed to standard quantities. Eventhe support of the English Farmers Union may be dependent on our settling detailsof the standard quantity/indicator price scheme at figures acceptable to them whichmay not be easy if they are at the same time to be acceptable to exporters. TheUnions&apos; support will also be dependent on the total figure agreed for imports inrelation to home production, and here I feel we have gone far enough.8. Finally there is the question of timetable. The Annual Review has already started and we must now know within the next week or so whether or not we arelikely to have a standard quantity in operation in 1964-65. The practical difficultiesof reaching agreement in time are very great.9. I have, therefore, come to the conclusion that we should not make anyfurther attempt to get a meat agreement this year involving control of the level ofimports and standard quantity arrangements at home.An alternative plan10. At the conclusion of the multilateral meeting last week officialssuggested that if agreement could not be reached the major exporters should decide to set up a joint body with the United Kingdom which would considerestimates of levels of home production and imports and discuss the implications of these estimates for each country&apos;s marketing policy having regard both tothe supplies likely to be absorbed by the market and to their phasing. It wasmade clear that under this alternative there would be no control over total supplies though we would hope that there would be improvements in phasing.Although the exporters were not prepared at that stage to discuss this proposal in any detail, it was received favourably, and it was agreed that discussions couldbe continued through diplomatic channels and possibly at a further meeting tobe held in about a month&apos;s time.11. A scheme on these lines would probably hold the position on theUnited Kingdom market for this year. We could continue discussions in the gatt Meat Group (which is due to meet again in a few weeks&apos; time) for a wider international agreement.Terms of public statement12. If my colleagues accept these suggestions, we need to agree on the termsof any public statement. This might be to the effect that, although considerable progress was made, we were not able to reach agreement on all points, includingthe levels of imports of beef and veal and mutton and lamb for 1964-65. Sincethe annual review has now begun, it is impossible to resolve the difference in timefor the introduction of standard quantities for the next fatstock year.13. The Government will continue to work for an international agreement on meat in the GATT Meat Group. In the meantime, it has suggested a looserform of arrangement which would not involve limitation either of imports or ofhome production but would provide for the constitution of an international body consisting of the United Kingdom and the major exporters which would discussthe levels and phasing of supplies in the hope that they could be better co-ordinatedon the United Kingdom market. Discussions about this alternative will be continuedthrough diplomatic channels.C. S.

The multilateral discussions which started on 27th January were adjournedon 7th February without agreement being reached. The main points of difficultywere :(a) the effectiveness of the proposed United Kingdom standard quantityscheme;(b) the nature of the obligations to be accepted by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin regard to the control of domestic production;(c) the treatment of new and minor suppliers;(d) the level of imports of beef and lamb.Effective standard quantity scheme2. Exporters did not object to our setting standard quantities at the expectedlevel of production in 1964-65. But they pointed out that the effectiveness of thescheme in restraining home production depended on the indicator prices fixed. Theprices they had in mind would have been very difficult to negotiate with the farmers Unions particularly at the level of supplies they proposed (paragraph 5).We had to say that if provisional agreement were reached it would be for exportersto judge after the annual review whether they felt able to complete in the light ofthe indicator prices and other details settled at the review.Nature of obligations to be accepted by United Kingdom3. A satisfactory provision was eventually negotiated which would have beenacceptable to the leaders of the English N.F.U. dealing with corrective action inthe event of the standard quantities being exceeded. The exporters also wanted theright to send additional supplies if the standard quantities were exceeded and themarket was strong and could be expected to remain so. A formula was worked outad referendum.Treatment of new and minor suppliers4. The exporters were reluctant to accept a reasonable figure for imports from new and minor suppliers (see below). Moreover they wanted a firm commitment that the United Kingdom would act to keep supplies within the appropriate level.The formula eventually reached ad referendum was that the United kingdom would take appropriate action if supplies from these suppliers were inconsistent with or imperilled the objectives of the agreement.Level of imports5. This was the point on which the negotiations foundered. The table belowshows the figures which officials, with the approval of Ministers (GEN 825,4th Meeting, Minute 2), put forward initially and a revised offer that I authorisedthem to make ad referendum to Ministers, together with the first and revised offers of the exporters (with the figures for earlier years for comparison).U.K. first1962-63   1963-64      offer as Exporters U.K. revised Exporters(forecast)   approved by      first offer revisedMinisters        offer (ad referendum) offer(&apos;000 tons)BeefImports from majorsuppliers......     - - 321 385 350 366Allowance  for  new and minor suppliers     - - 34 21 30 24Total imports ...    385        361 365 406 380 . 390Reserve......    &quot; - 25 Nil [25] Nil
6. Since the Board of Trade were insisting on a minimum of 30,000 tons rlfnew and minor suppliers, the final gap on beef was between the exporters&apos; figuresof 366,000 and our figure of 350,000 for the principal suppliers. In informal conversations conditional offers were made that would have covered 8,000 tonsof the gap, but it was impossible to bridge the remainder unless the United Kingdomcontributed. We should have needed to increase our offer to 354,000 to get-agreement.7. The corresponding gap on mutton and lamb was 8,000 tons, but the exporters were not willing to make any move towards us on that figure.
