CONFIDENTIAL nDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(8i) 30 COPY NO 8112 June 1981ECONOMIC STRATEGYNote by the Secretary of the Cabinet1. I attach, as background for the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on economicstrategy on Wednesday 17 June, two papers by the Chancellor of the Exchequer2. The first is a memorandum on the economic impact of North Sea oiland gas revenues prepared for the Ministerial Group on Energy Prices(MISC 56).3. The second is a memorandum on pay in the coming year beingprepared for circulation to the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy.Signed   ROBERT ARMSTRONGCabinet Office12 June 1981CONFIDENTIAL
(confidential)*Note by the Chancellor of the ExchequerIntroductionProduction of gas from the North Sea began  in the mid 1960&apos;s.Oil began to  flow in the mid  1970&apos;s.    The OK is now the world&apos;seighth largest producer.2.      Broadly speaking the North Sea adds directly to the nation&apos;sincome an amount which is equal to government tax revenues plusthe pi&apos;ofits of British owned companies operating in the North Sea(over and above what they might have earned elsewhere by usingthe same resources).    The table below shows recorded and forecastproduction.    It also  shows the direct contribution of the NorthSea to GNP and government revenues.- 1 -(confidential)

It  is  important to get these revenues  into perspective:a. the North Sea will make a contribution of only about5 per cent to GNP  in  1984.    The North Sea will not transformthe whole economy as  it does for OPEC producers.b. North Sea revenues will represent only about 6 per cent oftotal revenue of central and  local government in  1983-84. Andwe cannot  look forward to an enormous increase  in future. Therevenue would be sufficient to finance under half the defenceprogramme or about half of public sector investment. ,4-      The value of the North Sea has to be seen against the seven-foldincrease in real oil prices  in the  1970&apos;s.    North Sea oil  is not acheap source of supply.    Producing it has a  high resource cost.We are clearly better off with it than without  it.    But we arescarcely better off than we should have been without the oil,  and withthe oil price where it was at the beginning of the 1970&apos;s. North^ea oil has  not made Britain better off in any absolute sense.2 -(confidential)
(confidential)5. North Sea revenues  have protected our standard of living fromthe direct effects of the sharp increase in oil prices which hashit living standards  in other countries.    But  it cannot immuniseus from the effects of the oil price rise in slowing down thegrowth of world trade and output.The Structure of the Economy6. There are bound to be some structural changes in the economyas it adjusts to higher oil prices and the rising output of NorthSea oil.    Oil  is entirely tradeable.    So the relative importanceof the non-oil part of the tradeable goods sector (mainly manufacturing&apos;will be  less than  it would  have been before we produced oil. Thisneed not  involve an absolute contraction.    But these structuralchanges have come at the same time as the present recession andhave undoubtedly accentuated industry&apos;s difficulties.7. Other mature economies,  such as Norway and the Netherlandsthat have developed domestic oil or gas production have also hadto face adjustments  to  the  structure of output.    Australia,   and toa lesser extent Canada,   have also recently begun to analyse thechanges they are facing.    The nature of the adjustment for anyeconomy of course depends on the particular circumstances  in whichit finds  itself,   including the size of its reserves of fuel, thelength and shape of its production profile,  the size and healthof the traditional traded goods sector.8.      In the United Kingdom,  the  impact of North Sea oil on thestructure of the economy is mainly felt through its effect on thebalance of payments and the exchange rate.    Part of sterling&apos;srise in the past three years is probably attributable to North Seaoil, which has made sterling more attractive to foreigners as a[currency to  hold.    One consequence is that industry&apos;s competitivenessI has worsened,  at  least  in the short run  - though most of the loss f competitiveness which has occurred can be attributed to other3 -(confidential)
(confidential)causes such as an excessive growth  in labour costs.    But by improvingthe terms of trade,  the rise in the exchange rate has  increased realincomes and helped in reducing the rate of inflation.    The relativelysmall fall  in the nation&apos;s real disposable income  in  1980, comparedwith the fall  in GDP,  can be attributed largely to the impact ofNorth Sea oil,  and this has played a part  in sustaining final expenditure during the recession.9. The impact of oil on the balance of payments  has had otherbeneficial effects.    The strengthening of the current account enabledexchange controls to be abolished,  so allowing the private sectorto invest overseas and to finance such investment in the cheapestand most profitable way.    It has also allowed the foreign exchangereserves to be rebuilt and the most expensive public sector overseasdebt to be repaid.    Increased investment overseas helps the traditionaltraded goods sector by keeping the real exchange rate lower than itwould otherwise have been.    The associated improvements  in the UK&apos;snet overseas asset position will provide against the day when theoil begins to run down.The Use of Government Revenues from the North Sea10. While the Government&apos;s commitment to reduce  inflation isindependent of the existence of North Sea oil and gas,   its monetaryand fiscal policies have been framed with full  knowledge of boththe impact of and the opportunities afforded by the North Seawealth.     In other words the Government has consciously sought touse North Sea revenues in ways that reinforce its overall strategy.The Government&apos;s monetary and fiscal plans take full account ofthe existence of North Sea oil and the revenues  it provides (seefor example the fiscal projections  in the Financial Statement andBudget Report).    There are no huge government  revenues still to^allocated.4 -(confidential)
(confidential)11. In principle the Government can use  its part of the nationalincome benefits of oil - the North Sea revenues -  in any of thefollowing ways.     They are  not mutually exclusive:a. to reduce other taxes  (lower personal taxes helpmaintain  living standards);b. to increase public expenditure;c.     to reduce the PSBR while keeping to its medium termstrategy  -  this would reduce interest rates;d. to purchase foreign assets,  for example by interveningin the foreign exchange markets.Options c and d may lead to a  lower real exchange rate,  and thusreduce the relative contraction of the traditional traded goodssector.    Options a and b can  in principle be operated in a waythat leads to  lower domestic energy prices.12. The Government has used North Sea revenues  in most of theways outlined above.    Thus,  compared with what policies might havebeen in the absence of North Sea oil,  North Sea revenues have ineffect been used to reduce other taxes,  to reduce public sectorborrowing and to reduce  interest rates.    In this way - and by usingthe revenues to reduce  interest rates and thereby encouragedomestic  investment -  the current benefits of oil are being usedto generate higher income than would otherwise have been the casewhen the oil runs out.    If North Sea revenues did not exist theexisting  level of public  investment could only take place if taxationgenerally went  up,  of if borrowing and interest rates  increased orif other public expenditure went down.13.    It  is also clear that without the oil revenues  it would notbe possible to provide support and financial assistance for industryand employment from public funds on the scale we have,  or tomaintain public sector pay and pensions.
(confidential)Energy Prices14. Some sections of industry which are particularly hard hitwhen energy prices rise claim that North Sea oil should enablethem to be protected from high energy prices.    North Sea revenuesare,  however,  already fully allocated and cannot be used twiceover.    To use the benefits of North Sea oil to reduce energyprices for industry would mean that other taxes would have tobe higher or public expenditure be lower. Quite apart from thedifficulties that this would involve there are strong argumentsagainst using the benefits of North Sea oil  in this way.15. The fact that we have oil which costs  less to produce thanits value  in world markets  is a piece of national good fortuneon which energy users  have no prior claim.    But the economic costof using oil  in the UK remains the world price.    To sell cheaplyin home markets  implies committing oil to  low value uses andforegoing the higher value we could get in world markets. Thiswastes national resources exactly as  if we subsidised the use ofoil which we had  to  import.    Subsidising prices distorts themarket signals on which decisions about energy   use   and conservationare based,  with the result that our real  income is lower than itneed be.     In any case it would be impossible  in practice to operatea two-tier pricing system - subsidising the price  in the UK butexporting at world price.    The subsidised oil would quickly find itsway into the higher priced world market with large profits to bemade at the taxpayers&apos; expense.16.    By contrast,  where there  is no world market  in a particularform of energy  - electricity is the best example -  prices dependon conditions  in the domestic market.    Countries such as Francewith cheap non-tradeable sources   (hydro,  nuclear)  can have cheaperelectricity than those without and this will affect their competitivetrading position  in electricity intensive products.    There  is nogeneral economic case for subsidising our own energy prices tooffset such comparative advantages.-  6 -(confidential)
(confidential)17. This does not,  of course,  mean that revenues from the NorthSea cannot be used to help  industry,  while selling oil at worldprices and pricing in  line with costs  in the domestic market.If this  is done,  as has been the case,   by reducing governmentborrowing,   bringing down  interest rates and by making the fiscalregime as  helpful as possible to manufacturing,   industry can benefit&apos;without distorting the allocation of a scarce resource withinthe economy and encouraging wasteful consumption.    The huge billswe have already incurred  in supporting uneconomic industry (coal,steel etc)  make  it difficult enough to maintain our counterinflation strategy.    If North Sea revenues were diverted tosubsidising energy prices on a large scale,  the strategy could onlybe maintained,  as was explained in para  14,   by cutting expenditureor raising taxes elsewhere.Conclusion18. North Sea oil  has   benefited   the economy.    Inflation is lowerand living standards are higher than they would  have been  in theabsence of oil.    But oil has to-be kept  in perspective.    It contributesa relatively small proportion of total output and North Searevenues are relatively small compared to total tax revenues.19.    The oil revenue is all fully allocated.    It enables theGovernment to pursue  its counter-inflation strategy and relievethe strains on  industry by fiscal means and by bringing downinterest rates.    The benefits could not be passed on in the formof lower fuel prices without raising taxes or reducing expenditureelsewhere.    Moreover because of the need to avoid consuming energywastefully  it  is  not desirable to price the fuel  industry usesbelow cost.    The revenues are better used to help the economyadjust  in ways that do not squander a wasting asset.(G.H. )H-M. TREASURY5 June 1981(confidential)
(confidential)PAY IN THE COMING YEARNote by the Chancellor of the ExchequerThe level of pay settlements  is now averaging just under 10 per centin both public and private sectors.    This represents approximatelya halving of the rate of increase up to last summer.    The averagesconceal wide dispersions;    and the concept of a  &apos;pay round&apos;   is  in anycase artificial.    But a pattern has emerged over the past year ofsettlements  lower than in  the previous year.    It is now time to askwhat are the prospects for the coming year (broadly coincident withthe next session of Parliament)  and what the Government can do toimprove them and so help to restore competitiveness,  enable peopleto be priced back into jobs and hold back the increase  in publicexpenditure.2-      This note is  in three sections:-A. The past yearsB. Aims and expectations for the year ahead;C. Action required by the Government.^       The past year  (August  19 60 -  July 1981)^       Developments-  1 -(confidential)
(confidential)3.      After an average rise in earnings of 22 per cent in 1979-80,the period began with minor settlements of about  14 per cent or 15 percent,  though there was a wide scatter and no clear &quot;going rate&quot;.Thereafter the trend came down sharply,  helped by low settlementsat Vauxhalls  (8.4 per cent)  and British Leyland  (6.8 per cent) andby the agreement on minimum rates for engineering workers  (8.2 percent).    By October,  the average rate of settlements was around 10 percent.4. On 24 November 1980,  after some public indications of the direction]the Government was going,  it was announced that the pay factor forthe RSG cash  limit in  1981-82 would be 6 per cent and the non-payfactor 11 per cent,  and that broadly similar financial disciplineswould apply elsewhere in the public services.    After the earlysetback of the firemen&apos;s  18 per cent,  the  local authority manualssettled unexpectedly quickly for 7\  per cent;  and this was eventuallyfollowed by  school and university teachers and NHS ancillaries atcomparable or lower levels.    The Civil Service and most NHS grades,however,  have yet to settle.5. The public trading sector has divided into two broad groups.The pace for the monopoly utilities has been set by the miners&apos;settlement of 1 January 1981;    this produced an earnings increaseof 9.8 per cent,  but  it ran for only ten months and was widely regardedjas worth about  13 per cent.    This was broadly the subsequent levelin water,  gas and electricity.    Other industries have settled atlower levels,  down to 5 per cent in the case of the National FreightCorporation.6. Overall,  the average level of settlements in the period so faris just under 9 per cent  (public trading sector just under 10 percentj    public services 85 per cent;    private manufacturing just over9 per cent;    private non-manufacturing just under 9 per cent thoughsome important groups have yet to settle).    Settlements in the privatesector have covered a wide range - from little or nothing to asmuch as  15 per cent.(confidential)
(confidential)(ii) Likely outcome for 1980-81 as a whole7. By the third quarter of 1981 it is  likely that average earnings,allowing for drift, will be perhaps  10 per cent higher than a yearearlier;    retail prices up 11 per cent;    and the tax and price indexperhaps  14 per cent.    This implies a fall  in average real take-homepay of up to 5 per cent over a year earlier,  partly as a consequenceof tax and National  Insurance changes,  partly because of the  level ofwage settlements being rather below the rate of inflation.    This fallin real take-home pay follows a 12 per cent rise over the three yearsto 1980.(iii) Lessons to be learnt8. The halving of the rate of increase  (both settlements and totalearnings)  compared with the previous year, was no doubt the resultof a combination of economic factors and other influences onexpectations.    Monetary policy was acting as a national cash limitand contributing to the maintenance of a high real exchange rate,while the effects on costs and profits from previous excessive payincreases were still coming through.    The rise in unemployment inthe year to April 1981 was over a million, which will have weakenedpressure to maintain real take-home pay.    The exchange rate and thesqueeze on margins helped to curb price increases more sharply thanexpected so that the prospective  loss of purchasing power did notimmediately occur.    The rapid deceleration of pay increases in thepublic services may also have influenced the private sector result.The efforts of the Government and CBI  in the summer and autumn of 1980did much to create a public belief that  (a)  such a change could occurand  (b)  that the Government was determined to promote it.9       The following points emerge:-(a)    A substantial change in the  level of settlements can occurwith the first big clutch of settlements in the autumn.While those settlements are not decisive for the subsequentyear,  the possibility of getting them down from earlierlevels  is an opportunity to be grasped.-  3 -(confidential)
(confidential)(b) It has been demonstrated that such a downward change canoccur in the absence of a specific incomes policy and thatsettlements are not  necessarily determined by the year-on-year RPI figures.(c) Although the Government has been successful  in gettingreasonable settlements accepted in the public services(subject to the outcome of the Civil Service dispute),the monopoly nationalised industries remain a majorproblem with a tendency to be well above the average.B.      Aims  and expectations  for the year ahead( i )    Policy aims10. What general  level of pay settlements  is it desirable to aim forin  1981-82?    One approach  is to start from the monetary target (likelyto be in the region of 7 per cent next year)  and see what that impliesin terms of the growth of money GDP  (say  8 per cent -  9 per cent).This constitutes a sort of national cash limit,  combining both realgrowth and price changes.    Unless there is a better outcome than inthe  recent past cost and price increases will erode almost all thescope for real growth.    On the other hand,   lower wage  increases -associated within the national cash  limit with an  improvement inprofits - would,  after a short time  lag,  permit higher output andenable people to be priced back into employment.11. One can also look at competitiveness.    The  loss of competitivenessin manufacturing in the  last three years   (1978-1981),  as a result ofmovements  in the exchange rate on the one hand and relative unitlabour costs on the other,   is of the order of 60 per cent.    A hugereduction in  labour costs  (not just a reduction  in the rate of increase)would be needed to restore a significant part of the competitivenesslost over recent years.12. The conclusion is that pay increases need to be wall below therate of price inflation for two years or so in order to give theeconomy the best chance of substantial revival.    The need to reducerelative costs  in the public sector is also important.(confidential)
(confide ntIal)13. Recent experience shows that it is possible to see ten percentagepoints  knocked off the rate of pay increases  in a year.    If such a thingwere to happen again it would imply zero average increases, andtherefore in very many cases actual cuts  in money wages.    If thatcannot be regarded as realistic,  can we envisage halving the rate ofincrease of earnings,  i.e.  an average of less than 5 per cent,including increases obtained by higher productivity?    This would implyzero pay-increases in some cases.    Any implied fall in real take-hqmepay would depend also on the behaviour of prices and on budgetarydecisions next Spring;    but should be  less than over the previousyear.    The CBI are. working towards an objective of this kind.(ii) Prospects14. Pay settlements will continue to be affected by the tight profitand cash position of many companies,  the high level of unemploymentand the declining rate of price inflation.    Some early private sectorsettlements  (Vauxhalls,  BL,  Fords,  Road Haulage and the NationalEngineering Agreement)  are  in sectors under continuing financialpressure.15. On the other hand the reduction in real take-home pay may stiffenwage claims,-    company profitability may be recovering;    and, whileunemployment will be rising and price rises declining,  both will beoccurring more slowly than  in the  1980-81 round.    Moreover thepolice settlement  in September (linked to average earnings) will appearhigh;    political changes  in local authorities will make their actionsunpredictable;    and the tone for the Nationalised Industries willagain be set by the settlement for the miners  (now advanced to1 November 1981).16. In the light of all this,  a wide range of outcomes  is possible.But the assessment reflected in the assumptions for the FSBR and MTFSis for wage settlements averaging no more than 6 per cent (earnings7 per cent).    On this sort of basis there would be no further fall inreal take-home pay  (assuming tax allowances and rates are adjustedfor inflation in the  1982 Budget).-  5 -(confidential)
(confidential)C.      Action required by the Government( i)    Public presentation of objective17. There needs to be an early opening up of the case for gettingpay settlements down and creation of expectation that this is possibleand that the Government will play its part.    Although the Governmenthas used a 6 per cent factor for pay in the coming year  (for settingcash  limits  in the current financial year where the pay and financialyears do not coincide),  this was expressly stated to be provisional.The new 7 per cent general price/pay factor for use in the publicexpenditure survey has rightly been seen as  indicating lower ratesfor pay alonej    and the assumed further deceleration  in  later yearshas been noted.    When things are next said in public, we should tryto lead opinion in the direction of low single figures   (implying anaverage nearer to zero than to ten),  and the maximum coverage of anyincreases by productivity improvement.18. This carries the danger of confusion with an explicit pay policyIt  is  important,  therefore,  that the task of setting the scene, inwhich the  level of expectations steadily falls,   is shared by others.19. Deceleration  in the past year owes something to the CBI&apos;sconferences with employers in the middle of 1980 and speeches bySir Raymond Pennock.    They are planning similar conferences on  18 and25 June this year.     If they achieve consensus,  as they hope to do,on the sort of objective in paragraph   13,    this could form the basisof a valuable campaign,  as  last year.20. A plan therefore needs to be prepared for getting this messagedisseminated on the broadest front, through government, the NEDC ifpossible, and other channels. The theme would be the need to allowthe economy to grow within the national cash limit.( ii )  Public services21. The Government&apos;s approach to cash  limits has had a stiffeningeffect in the current round.    The Lord President&apos;s assurance to theCivil Service unions that the Government will next year enter-  6 -(confidential)
(confidential)negotiations without a predetermi ned cash  limit must not now be takenas indicating a more relaxed attitude.    On the contraryj comparisonswith average private sector trends will remain inappropriate so longas the  level of private sector pay deals  implies more unemployment.And,  if we do see a  lead towards  lower settlements coming from theprivate sector,   it  is vital that the public sector reinforces itwith disciplines at  least as strong.    Spending authorities must beencouraged to squeeze pay so as to get the best outcome in termsof volume.     If the aim is to finish up at  less that  5 per cent,starting points will need to be very low indeed to allow room fornegotiation.    A method of handling this will have to be worked outjthe best context  is probably the Ministerial Committee on PublicServices Pay.( i i i)  Nationalised industries22. The nationalised industries,  especially those with monopolypower,  pose exceptional difficulties,   in the  light of their above-average settlements,  the concessions made to the miners and thestrategic advancement of the miners&apos;  settlement date by two months.Financial pressure  is not holding down  labour costs as  in the privatesector (or even the public services).    The bargaining positions ofthe unions are strong,  and preventive measures  (eg coal stockpiling)difficult to take on a significant scale.    Nationalised industrysettlements are highly visible and influential.23. A plan is therefore needed for handling critical issues asthey arise  in the next nine months.    The Official Committee onNationalised Industry Policy  (NIP)  could provide an umbrella forwork on this.Coficlusion24. Further deceleration .of pay increases  is vital. Ifcompetitiveness is to be restored reasonably quickly - after yearsof increases that were far too high - then there should theoreticallybe no increases at all,  even  in money terms.    A programme of actionshould be worked out,   including the following elements:-(a)    Public opinion needs to be conditioned to increases7(confidential)
(confidential)substantially  lower than  in the current round. Withoutsuggesting a norm,  opinion should be focussed on &quot;lowsingle figures&quot;,  as necessary to allow the economy to grow.This  implies work by officials  to prepare for:(i)  a sequence of Ministerial speeches;(ii)  liaison with CBI;(iii)  other forms of publicity to emphasise theconsequences,  especially for employment, offailing to achieve a further deceleration.(b) A plan for handling public service pay negotiations inthe next round,  including the timing and nature ofstatements about cash  limits;    this might be handled bythe Ministerial  Committee  on Public Service Pay.(c) A review by officials of the prospects for pay settlementsin the nationalised industries and the means availablefor influencing them.(G.H. )H.M.
