CONFIDENTIALITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 3523 June 1981COPY NO81CABINETINTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTREMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. I regard the terms offered by the Pearl Assurance Company forfinancing the International Conference Centre (as set out in the Annex tothe memorandum by the Secretaries of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs and the Environment (C(81) 34)) as unacceptable.2. Cabinet decided last July (CC(80) 29th Conclusions, Minute 4) thatthis project was not of a sufficiently high priority to warrant finance frompublic funds and that the Conference Centre should only be built if financedby the private sector.    But the present offer has no more than theappearance of privatisation.    In the eyes of the world it would cleaily be aGovernment building.    The Government would remain the site landlord.The Propeity Services Agency wouid be solely responsible for construc-tion.     The building would be tailor-made to Government requirements andthe Government would have virtually exclusive use of it.    The site andbuilding would revert to Crown ownership at the end of the 125-year leaseduring which the rent would be indexed at five-year intervals.    We shouldnot escape the risk of having to find alternative accommodation if therewere delays, and if the cost of building overruns the maximum amountoffered by Pearl, we should have to find the extra money.    Any failure toproduce the building on time would be laid at our door.    By contrast thePearl carries practically no risk in return for providing the capital. TheCentre would in effect simply be a Government project financed with amortgage from the private sector.3. The finance for the project is available on terms which would be atleast two or thrre times more expensive than it would be if we obtained itby borrowing through the gilt-edged market.     The attached Annexexplains the calculations.    The reason for the difference is that the Pearlcan only borrow at higher rates than the Government and the paymentshave to make allowance for the private sector profits.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. The proposal will Inevitably be attacked as a sham and no morethan a device for evading our own controls on public expenditure.    It issomething we do not allow to happen in nationalised industries and localauthorities.    We shall be criticised by them and the Public AccountsCommittee if we allow it to happen in this case.    It will be said withjustice that if this project is regarded as one enjoying high priority as faras Government is concerned, it should be financed by the public sector inthe normal way, at very much lower cost.    If it does not enjoy suchpriority, it should not go ahead at all.5. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s recent memorandum toCabinet (C(81)Z9) demonstrated, there may be a case for productive publicsector investment.     The Government is already having to turn downinvestments which show a good rate of return in order to maintain down-ward pressure on public expenditure.    But the best way of financingprofitable public investment i s to cut out unprofitable public investment.   If weallow the Conference Centre to go ahead the finance could well prevent ox-make more expensive the finarcing of genuir^ely profitable schemes whetherin the private or public sectors.6. I invite colleagues to reject the proposed offer of finance fromPearl.L BTreasury Chambers23 June 19812CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEXINTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTRE:    THE COMPARATIVE FINANCINGCOSTS OF USING PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FINANCEThis note compares the cost of financing the construction of theConference Centre by means of the offer from Pearl Assurance, withthe cost if financed from public funds.     Essentially, under thefirst option, the Government would be committed to payments ofrent for 125 years.     Under the second, the construction costswould be financed from borrowing on the gilt-edged market. Theassessment involves bringing the two streams of payment to acommon basis of comparison on certain assumptions about the rateof inflation and the likely cost of Government borrowing.2      The assumptions are:(i)   The construction cost is  4-0.65 million (cash) spread inthe way indicated in the joint Memorandum by theSecretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and the Environ-ment (^0(81)3^).(ii)   The terms of the offer and the interest cost to PearlAssurance are as outlined in the Annex to that Memorandum.(iii) The initial rent is 6.123 per cent of the capital costwith five-year rent reviews linked to rental movementsfor offices in the Victoria area.(iv)   Increases in Victoria rents move on average(a) in line with the general movement of pricesor(b) 1 per cent faster than the general movementof prices.(v)   The Government can borrow on terms which are2 per cent per annum higher than the rate ofinflation
CONFIDENTIAL(vi)    Initial rent yield of 6.1&apos;23%, reviewed every five years,is equivalent to an initial annually reviewed rent of5 per cent.      This is because the real value of the rentdeclines over the period between reviews.     This assump-tion is sensitive to the rate of inflation used but thevariation is not more than 1 percentage point between0 and 15 per cent inflation.(vii)   The distribution of financing cost over time is the samefor public or private finance.3 The comparison between the costs is shown in the table below.This expresses the cost of the Pearl Assurance offer as a multipleof the public financing cost.Rents move in line Rents move 1% p.a.with inflation faster than rateof inflationCost of Pearl 2.6 times 4.0 timesAssurance offer asmultiple of publicsector financingThis shows that, on the assumptions given the cost to the Governmentof accepting the Pearl offer would be 2.6 - 4 times more expensivethan financing the construction by the sale of gilt edged securitiesjThe main factors are the real rate of Government borrowing and thereal rate of rental growth.      The private financing cost would beeven higher than the figures shown if the Government was able toborrow at a rate consistently lower than 2 per cent above the move&apos;ment of prices, and if rental growth was consistently higher than&apos;per cent in real terms.      Similarly the figures would be lower ifGovernment borrowing were more expensive or if rents moved moreslowly than prices.     The rate of inflation is not an importantfactor.      The Treasury believe that the assumptions used arerealistic.     In particular the assumption for Government borrowingreflects long-term historic trends.HM Treasury22 June 1981
