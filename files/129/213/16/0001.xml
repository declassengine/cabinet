CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81)41 COPY NO 8124 July 1981CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1981-82Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department1. At their meeting on 11 June (CC(81) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 4), theCabinet approved the legislative programme for the 1981-82 Session ofParliament recommended by The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future LegislationCommittee (QL), subject to the addition of a Bill dealing with trade unionimmunities, and to further consideration of the length of the proposedHousing Bill, the timing of the Gas (Industrial and Commercial Suppliep) Bill,and the need for an Insolvency Bill next Session.    On 23 June, the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy agieed that the British Gas Corporationshould be required to dispose of their domestic appliance retailing interestsover a five-year period, and invited QL Committee to consider thelegislative implications of adding any necessary provisions (includingprovisions on safety) to the Gas (Industrial and Commercial Supplies) Bill.2. This note reports the outcome of the Committee&apos;s further considerationof these outstanding issues.    The Committee noted that we may well have tocarry next Session&apos;s programme in an atmosphere of heightened politicaltension in Parliament and the country.    The main problem is likely to be lessthe number of Bills in the programme (which, if we stick to present plans,will be significantly smaller than in our first two Sessions) than the fact thatalmost al1 the 19 Bills in the main programme approved on 11 June will behighly controversial.    This programme will place a very heavy burden on oursupporters in both Houses, and the difficulties of managing it in an orderlyway will be increased by problems of timing.    It is very likely that theprogramme in the Commons for the first part of next Session will be affectedby the need to find time for a Canada Bill.    Royal Assent for eight of themain programme Dills by April 1982 is either essential or highly desirable.There is still a good deal of uncertainty about the timetable for the policyapproval and drafting of the two controversial measures on trade unionimmunities and local government finance.    It will be surprising if either isready for introduction until well into 1982.    They will dominate the secondhalf of next Session, and are almost certain to generate yet another substantialspillover in the House of Lords in the autumn of next year. These1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALuncertainties make it particularly important that Departments should honourthe commitments they have given about the timetable for the preparation ofother Bills.    So far, few of the main programme Bills have received completepolicy approval, let alone reached an advanced drafting stage.3. The Committee remained concerned about the wide range of controver-sial subjects which it is propcsed to include in the Housing Bill, in addition tothe unified housing benefit (UHB) provisions &apos;vhich were the main justificationfor giving it a place ir next Session&apos;s programme.     Even if we were to reachagreement on confining the Bill as introduced to a relatively small number ofsubjects in addition to UHB, it would be difficult to draft the Bill in a waywhich would effectively prevent our own supporters ao well as the Oppositionfrom tabling a large number of new clauses and schedules whose discussionwould occupy a great deal of Parliamentary time, and some of which we mightbe unable to resist.    Rather than set an arbitrary limit to the size of the Billat this stage, we agreed that it would be preferable to let drafting proceed onall those points which have received collective policy approval, and to reviewthe Bill when a complete draft is available.4. Cabinet noted on 11 Tune that the place of the Gas (IndustriaJ andCommercial Supplies) Bill in the programme would ha*&apos;e to be looked at againunless it could be read/ for introduction considerably earlier than February1982.    The business managers have alwayj made clear their seriousreservations about the ability of the Department of Energy to cope with thismeasure m addition to the three other major Bills to which they arecommitted.     The majority of QL Committee now think that the Bill would haveto be ready in time for introduction and S jcond Reading before Christmas if theprogramme as a whole is to be manageable.    The Secretary of State forEnergy had made considerable efforts to improve the timetable for thepreparation of the Bill in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, but theinformation given to the Committee suggested that it would be unrealistic tohope that the Bill as originally envisaged could be drafted before early inJanuary.     The addition of the gas appliance retailing and safety provisionscould delay its introduction until well into February.    In these circumstances,the Comrrrttee felt that they had to recommend that time could not now befound next Session for any legislation affecting the position of the British GasCorporation.5. The controversial Insolvency Bill would have run to some 2 50 clausesand a number of schedules, and the Committee were grateful to the Secretaryof State for Trade for agreeing to withdraw it from next Session&apos;s programme,on the understanding that the manpower implications would be furtherconsidered between his Department and the Civil Service Department.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. In accordance with the decision taken by Cabinet on 11 June, drafting ofthe proposed Water Bill, which is not at present included in the programme, isgoing ahead against the possibility that it might be added to the programme at alater stage.    The Committee took the view that it was highly unlikely thatadditional time would become available for this purpose.7. The Cabinet has alrealy decided against including a Duchy of CornwallManagement Bill in the main programme.    The Duchy authorities have beenpressing Ministers further to find time for this Bill, which would authorise anumber of desirable reforms in the administration of the Duchy, and thePrince of Wales has also been in touch with the Prime Minister on the samesubject.     The Committee agreed that room could be found for this Bill in theprogramme on condition that it was introduced in the Commons and notproceeded with unless the House agreed to deal with it under the SecondReading Committee procedure.8. I invite colleagues:i. To note the position reached on the Housing, Insolvency and WaterBiUs.ii. To agree that there should be no legislation next Session on eitherthe appliance retailing or gas supply activities of the British GasCorporation.iii. To approve the addition of the Duchy of Cornwall ManagementBill to the list of Bills for Second Reading Committee procedure nextSession.W WHome Office24 July 19813CONFIDENTIAL
