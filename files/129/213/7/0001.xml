FOURTH REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEEON THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONERFOR ADMINISTRATIONSESSION 1979-80Observations by the GovernmentIntroductory1. This White Paper contains the Government&apos;s response to the observationsand recommendations made in the Select Committee&apos;s Fourth Report forSession 1979-80*.Contractual and Commercial Matters2. Paragraph 9 of Schedule 3 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967excludes &quot;contractual or other commercial transactions&quot; from investigation bythe Commissioner. For the reasons given in paragraph 8 of their Report, theSelect Committee concluded that the continued exclusion of these transactionsfrom the Commissioner&apos;s jurisdiction would not be justified.3. The Government have given very careful consideration to the Committee&apos;sobservations but have, concluded that, for the reasons previously given inevidence, Parliament&apos;s decision to exclude this area of administration from theCommissioner&apos;s jurisdiction remains sound.Public Service Personnel Matters4. Paragraphs 9-18 of the Committee&apos;s Report discuss the exclusion fromthe Commissioner&apos;s jurisdiction of complaints about public service personnelmatters. The Committee concluded that this exclusion was justified in the caseof complaints from serving public employees and from members of the armedforces about matters of discipline, promotion, rates of pay and terms of service.They considered, however, that conclusive evidence had not been produced toshow that other purely administrative acts of government departments in theircapacity as employers should continue to be excluded from investigation bythe Commissioner.5. The Committee commented expressly on one of these matters: complaintsfrom specialists recruited for the service of overseas governments by theOverseas Development Administration. Recruitment and superannuationmatters are the other two main areas of administration which would becomesubject to investigation if the Committee&apos;s proposals were adopted.Overseas Specialists6. The Government have carefully considered the proposal that certain staffrecruited for the service of overseas governments by the Overseas Development*HC 593.2
Administration should not be excluded from investigation by the ParliamentaryCommissioner by the terms of paragraph 10(c) of Schedule 3 to the Act.7. The Government would have liked to accept the Committee&apos;s proposalwithout more ado. But its implementation could cause difficulties involvingCrown servants who work side by side with the overseas supplemented staff.The Government are examining these difficulties and, if they can be overcomesatisfactorily, will introduce legislation to enable the Commissioner to investigatecomplaints about purely administrative acts of the Overseas DevelopmentAdministration in the personnel management field where these apply tooverseas supplemented staff.Recruitment8. The Government have also considered very carefully the proposal thatthe Commissioner should be empowered to investigate complaints aboutrecruitment to the Home Civil Service and the Diplomatic Service.9. The Civil Service Commissioners are responsible for the selection on meritby fair and open competition of all candidates for posts in the Civil andDiplomatic Services. The Commissioners are appointed by Order in Councilto ensure their independence of Ministers, Parliament or anyone else. Recruit-ment is, therefore, already subject to rigorous scrutiny by an independentbody. The Government are not persuaded of the justification for subjectingthe activity of one independent body to oversight by another. Moreover, theybelieve that it would be inequitable to give applicants for jobs in the CivilService a channel for the investigation of complaints not available to thosewho seek employment elsewhere. For these reasons, the Government are unableto agree with the Committee that the Commissioner&apos;s jurisdiction should beextended to include complaints about recruitment.Superannuation10. The Government have given equally thorough consideration to the SelectCommittee&apos;s view that complaints from former public servants about theirsuperannuation should be open to investigation by the Commissioner.11. Public service pensioners already have the advantage that their grievancesmay be raised in either House of Parliament. If the Commissioner&apos;s terms ofreference were extended as recommended by the Committee, former publicservants would be granted a further preferential means of redress which is notavailable to other occupational pensioners. In addition, a serious inequitywould be created between retired public servants and those who are still inservice. Since the decisions or actions complained of are as likely to ariseduring a person&apos;s service as after it, no valid distinction can be drawn betweenpensioners and those who are still serving. It would be highly anomalous ifpublic service pensioners had access to the Commissioner, while serving officerswishing to raise similar or even identical complaints had not.12. The Government share the view of successive Administrations that theCommissioner was not established to investigate relations between the State
as employer and its employees. They also believe it would be wrong in principleto confer on public service pensioners a right, not available to others in similarcircumstances, to seek the assistance of the Commissioner. The Governmentregret that they are unable to agree with the Select Committee on this point.They consider, however, that these arguments of principle together constitutea compelling reason not to extend the Parliamentary Commissioner&apos;s terms ofreference to include matters raised by public service pensioners.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Harrison &amp; Sons (London) Ltd.34733   Dd 254817   C15 6/81ISBN 0 10 182740 7
