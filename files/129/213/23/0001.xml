CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 48 COPY NO &quot;22 September 1981CABINETLOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE 1982-83Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentINTRODUCTION1. Cabinet on 15 September invited me, in consultation with otherMinisters concomed, to circulate a memorandum on the case for cashadditions to local authority current expenditure in 1982-83 to compensate forpay and price increases in 1981-82 in excess of the cash limit set for that year.(CC(81) 31st Conclusions, Minute 4).    I have discussed the issues with theChief Secretary, Treasury, and with other colleagues principally concerned,and the proposals set out in this memorandum reflect the general agreementreached at out meeting.    Our proposals are not for relaxing our pressureon local government to keep its expenditure within reasonable limits but formaking that pressure effective.BACKGROUND2. In June we asked local authorities in England to submit revised budgetsfor 1981-82, and threatened to withhold up to  450 million of grant if theresponse were unsatisfactory.    Most authorities responded positively, andthe revised budgets showed a gross reduction of some  200 million (atNovember 1980 prices).    However, this was offset by increases of about thesame amount, largely because of Labour successes in the local electionsearlier in the year.    The revised budgets, therefore, continue to show avolume excess of nearly 6 per cent over our target for the year.    At outturnthis might come down to about 3J; per cent; it is unlikely to be lower.3. Our current plans assume that local government will not onlyeliminate this excess in 1982-83 but aloo make a further reduction of aboutf per cent (the I per cent reduction planned in Cmnd 8175, as modified by thebids already accepted for post-16 education and the police).4. The cash limits set for 1981-82 (11 per cent for prices, 6 per cent forpay) implied an overall inflation factor of 6. 74 per cent for local governmentcurrent expenditure this year.    Local authorities expect actual inflation tobe about 9.7 per cent.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. Our present plans, therefore, imply a real reduction of at least 7 percent between 1981-82 and 1982-83: 3f per cent to eliminate this year&apos;s volumeexcess, \ per cent to comply with Cmnd 8175 as modified, and 3 per cent toeliminate this year&apos;s excess inflation.    The cash factors for 1982-83 of 4 percent for pay and 9 per cent for prices may impose a further squeeze if localauthorities reach excessive pay increases.6. In my discussions with colleagues there was general agreement thatit would be totally unrealistic to look for reductions of this scale. Localauthorities overall have only ever managed to reduce expenditure in threeyears: between 1976-77 and 1977-78, by 2 per cent, between 1979-80 and1980-81, by 2% per cent to 3 per cent (Department of the Environment fore-cast); and between 1980-81 and 1981-82, by perhaps 1 per cent (Department ofthe Environment forecast).    A reduction of 7 per cent or more in 1982-83cannot conceivably be achieved, even with the help of the new legislation whichthe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (E) has agreed should bebrought into force for next year to deal with the exceptionally high spenders.7. Besides, the 7 per zent is an average.    Some authorities have alreadymade large reductions, or are spending at or below their Grant BelatedExpenditure Assessments, and so could not be expected to cut much further.Other authorities would, therefore, have to make much bigger cuts; theimplications for individual authorities are discussed in Annex A. Suchindividual targets are even mire unrealistic than the aggregate. Whilethere have been examples of individual local authorities reducing expenditureby large amounts (10 per cent or more), few of the larger spenders haveachieved much more than 5 per cent in any one year; and those that have, haveoften failed to sustain the reductions in the following year.8. I must stress thatxthis is not primarily a problem of controlling theirresponsible high spenders - for which the new legislation should give usadequate powers.    We must recognize that local authorities in general face abasic difficulty in reducing current expenditure: 70 per cent of their costsare manpower, and real reductions are, therefore, constrained by theunavoidable costs of redundancies.    In some circumstances a rapid run-downof staff can cost more than keeping them on.    A 7 per cent real reduction incurrent expenditure in 19G2-83 would imply a reduction in manpower of about150, 000 full time equivalents in one year, compared with a total reduction of60, 000 over the two year period June 1979-81, and an annual rate of reduction f 40, 000 implied by the figures for the most recent quarter.    (Annex B givesfurther information about manpower reductions, as requested by the Cabinet. )9. There is an argument that although a 7 per cent real reduction year onyear is unrealistic, we should maintain it as our declared objective in orderto exert maximum pressure on local government.    There is some force inthat argument, and I would not wish to rule out this option at this stage.There are, however a number of difficulties which we ought to considercarefully.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL10. First the practical difficulties.    We announced to the ConsultativeCouncil on 4 August that we were considering setting individual expendituretargets for each local authority.    But this approach, especially if the targetsare reinforced through the block grant machinery, will only work if they arcrealistic.11. As to the political difficulties, for success in reducing localgovernment expenditure we are vitally dependent on the co-operation of localauthorities.    A few, under Labcur control, will not co-operate with us inany circumstances; v e are taking powers to deal with these.    For the rest,we shall only secure their co-operation if we are seen to be pursuingobjectives which are both reasonable and practicable.12. Finally, if we are seen to include unrealistic figures in the RateSupport Grant (RSG) settlement and the Public Expenditure White Paper, weshall be offering ammunition to cur informed critics.ATTITUDE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT13. At a meeting of the Consultative Council on 17 September the localgovernment representatives argued very strongly that we should set a morerealistic objective for next year     I was not, of course, able to offer anyprospect of such an adjustment, but I made it clear that the prospectivelegislation to which I referred in my statements of 2 June and 3 Septemberwould be directed at a small number of high spending authorities, and thatthe Government would continue to look to the rest of local government forvoluntary co-operation in achieving our overall objective.    I invitedsuggestions for how we might proceed on this basis.14. I believe that there is a reasonable chance of a positive response, butthe difficulties for the local authority associations actually delivering apackage must not be underestimated.PROPOSALS15. Against this background, I have three proposals.16. First, in preparing for the RSG settlement we should, for internalpurposes, use three alternative assumptions about expenditure levels in1982-83: first, the 7 per cent real reduction implicit in our present plans;second, a real reduction of 4 per cent; and third, a real reduction of 3 percent.    These imply nominal increases in the cash provision for localauthority current expenditure in England of about nil,   500 million and 700 million respectively.17. Second, I should continue my discussions with local authority leadersabout the prospects for further reductions in current expenditure next year.By suggesting that there may be some scope for adjusting the present targetto a more realistic level, I would seek to secure their collective endorsementof an alternative aggregate figure.    I would not, however, propose to3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALindicate the scale of the adjustment which we are contemplating.    For thehigh spending authorities, which are anlikely to co-operate with us in anycircumstances, we shall need to use the interim measures under discussionin E Committee.18. Third, we should instruct officials to advise us urgently on how anyincrease in the cash provision for next year should be apportioned betweenprogrammes.    This has to be decided as a basis for our consideration ofthe options for the forthcoming RSG settlement.    We should aim to have theRSG settlement before Christmas because the targets and thresholds used init will also be the basis for the thresholds to be set under the new legislativemeasures, which will at that stage still be passing through Parliament. Thisrequires decisions on the service apportionment by mid-October.19. In discussing these proposals colleagues thought it important that anydecision to increase next year&apos;s cash provision - if that is what we decide inthe light of our further discussion with local government - should be defendedon its merits rather than as stemming from a need to &quot;validate&quot; this year&apos;sexcess inflation.    To base the argument on validation would risk damage tothe system of cash planning, and could prejudice pay negotiations in future.I support this view.20. It would also be important to stress that an increase in cash provisionwould be merely a recognition of reality, and would not represent a sub-stantive decision to increase public expenditure.    It would not provide anygrounds for increasing other public expenditure programmes.21. We shall need to consider th  implications for Scotland, Wales, andNorthern Ireland.    Annex C contains information, as requested by theCabinet, about differences in performance between the English localauthorities and others.    The problem of realism also arises on the presentScottish figures and the Secretary of State for Scotland proposes similaradjustments.    The Secretary of State for Wales endorses the approach thatI suggest, and proposes a matching adjustment in his programme.CONCLUSION22. I, therefore, invite colleagues to note that our present publicexpenditure plans imply a real reduction of local government currentexpenditure of at least 7 per cent between 1981-82 and 1982-33; and to agree:i. That in the next stages of our preparation for the 1982-83RSG settlement we should - for internal purpose only - considerthree alternative assumptions about the real reduction: 7 per cent(ie the present plans), 4 per cent, and 3 per cent.ii. That officials should be instructed to advise further on howany increase in cash provision might be apportioned betweenprogrammes.4CONFIDENTIAL

This was a crude approach, which should be avoidednext year.2.   A more sophisticated system of targets would seek largerreductions frc^J high spenders, and   lower reductions from others.Those spending at or below their GREs would have a strong claimto be treated as low spenders.    If authorities of this kind wereto be given less stringent targets - say 2% if the aggregatewere 1% - the high spenders would have to cut their expenditureby much&quot;more.    This could mean reductions of 15% or more fromauthorities such as the following (selected on the basis oftheir spending in relation to GRE in 1981-82):CamdenGreenwichLewishamSouthwarkTower HamletsSouth YorkshireGLCILEABristolLerwentsideBasildon
