CONFIDENTIALIIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 34 COPY NO    8 123 June 1981CABINETINTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs and the Secretary of State forthe Environment1. Cabinet decided last July that while they were in favour ofbuilding an International Conference Centre at Broad Sanctuary,Westminster, the project could go ahead only if it was financed from theprivate sector and invited the Secretary of State for the Environment toexplore how this could be achieved (CC(80) 29th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. We now seek agreement to the terms secured by the Secretary ofState for the Environment from the Pearl Assurance Company. Thedeadline for acceptance set by the Company is the end of June. Theterms of the offer are set out in the Annex.3. Unless colleagues decide that public funds should be used webelieve that the Pearl offer represents the only way of ensuring that aConference Centre meeting the Government&apos;s requirements of layout andsecurity is ready in time for the 1987 United Kingdom Presidency of theEuropean Community (EC).    Work on the substructure of the Centre is onschedule as a charge to public funds.4. The United Kingdom Government is unique in having to host majorconferences of the Commonwealth, EC, North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation and Economic Summits:   we must provide proper facilitiesfor Heads of State or Government and other Ministers.    We need - and donot have - meeting rooms of the right size and configuration for round tableconference work, with efficient simultaneous interpretation systems,delegation offices, first-class communications, effective administrativesupport, the right security arrangements and facilities for the Press.These are basic working necessities, not luxuries.    Our preparations forthis year&apos;s EC Presidency provide regular reminders of the inadequacy ofour present arrangements.    We must have the Centre ready by the time ofour third Presidency, when Lancaster House will be quite incapable ofmeeting the requirements of the enlarged Community.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. Colleagues accepted last yea_- that the Broad Sanctuary planrepresented the only practicable solution to the requirement. Noalteriative possibilities have presented themselves.    We have examinedagain other avilable facilities including the Barbican Centre, but none canaccommodate the type of intergovernmental meetings for which we need toprovide.6. We are satisfied the Pearl offer is the best we can obtain from theprivate sector.    Healey and Baker, who with the concurrence of the ChiefSecretary, Treasury were commissioned, approached 40 majorinstitutions and publicly invited offers;  they strongly recommend thisoffer as the best available.    Their advice is that we could not expect toimprove on it, and that they could not recommend any other form ofprivate sector funding.7. A Conference Centre of the kind we require would not be acommercial proposition for a private developer because there would be nosufficient demand from the private sector for all the facilities theGovernment reed.    We therefore see no prospect of a private developerproviding a building to let to us when we require it.    We intend howeverthat, if the scheme is carried out as proposed, it should be managed byprivate sector agents to maximise its return from private lettings.8. The project would use private resources to the fullest possibleextent.    It has been designed by private consultants and will provide over 30 million worth of work for the private construction industry, fundedfrom private sector sources on the advice of leading private estatesconsultants.9. The Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s view is contained in his paper(C(81) 35).10. While it can be shown, by taking a sufficiently low discount rate,that leasing costs more than Government borrowing, this is relevant onlyif there is to be a choice between the two methods.    If there is no pros-pect of Government funding, the only question is whether the termsoffered for leasing are acceptable.    The agents advise that they arereasonable and in line with market conditions.    There is nothing unusualin leasing or in lease-leaseback arrangements:   60 per cent of theGovernment Office estate is leased.    If it were thought preferable to usepublic funds, the spread of expenditure at cash prices, on the basis beingused for the current Public Expenditure Survey, would be as follows:1982-83      1983-84      1984-85 1985-86  million      8.78 15.20 13.34 3.33These sums cannot be found within existing public expenditure programmes,Under the offer by Pearl Assurance, on the other hand, no rent becomespayable until 1986 and the first rent review would not be due until 1991.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL11. We therefore invite colleagues to;a. agree that private sector funds should be used for theconstruction of the International Conference Centre; andb. authorise the Secretary of State for the Environment to acceptthe Pearl Assurance Company offer;c. or, in the event of Cabinet deciding against the proposals ata. and b. , to authorise the Secretary of State for the Environmentto put the Broad Sanctuary site on the market for immediate sale.CM HForeign and Commonwealth Office23 June 19813CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEX&apos;   The most favourable offer for private funding for the^rncfnaction of the International Conference Centre that hasve-n made is that proposed by the Pearl Assurance Company onthe following terms:a.a 125 year lease to Pearl Assurance of the BroadSanctuary site and a lease back to the Secretary ofState &apos;for the Environment of the completed building,both leases to run from the date of completion;b. a total capital requirement of L^km (including interestduring construction at 10% and taking account of inflationin building costs);c. &quot;   initial rent on completion set at 6.123% of the capitalcost (a sum of  3-.3m a yearrat present values this is 2.7m per annum);d. 5 year rent reviews linked to rental movements of officesin the Victoria area;f.   a contingency drawing availability of  6rn.i^ the eventof higher construction costs than those currently estimatedat 10% interest during construction but with an initialrent of 7.123% on any such drawing.
