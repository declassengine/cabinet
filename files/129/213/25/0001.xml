CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(8l)50COPY NO14 October 1981 82CABINETECONOMIC POLICY AND PUBLIC SPENDINGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerPART IINTRODUCTION1. We now need to take decisions about public expenditure for 1982-83and later years.    This paper describes the framework:  the Chief Secretary&apos;spaper C(8l) 51 gives detailed proposals for the main programmes.2. The background against which we have to take our decisions iscomplex, with political and social factors no less important than the economicconsiderations.    Unemployment is now at the centre of the stage.    And weare more than half way through the Parliament, and will face a generalelection within the next two years or so.    Various critics call for variouschanges of course.    I have tried in this paper to set our consideration ofpublic expenditure in this wider context3. Our objectives have not of course changed:  nor should they.We must continue to work to restore the health of the economy, with higherproductivity, greater competitiveness, lower inflation realistic pay-bargaining, and hence more jobs.    This is inevitably a long-run operation,and we must resist short-term expedients which would run counter to thelong-term aims.    But it would be equally short-sighted to miss any sensibleway of improving our chances of remaining in a position, in two or threeyears time, to ensure that these aims are still pursued.     In short, we must -continue to follow the treatment which alone can restore health in the long run,but try to strike the balance most likely to secure our chances of beingallowed to complete the treatment.4. We must also take account of the international context.    I havedescribed, in a minute of 8 October to the Prime Minister, how currentdevelopments in the United States economy affect our policies and prospects.The overall aim of the United States Administration is very similar to ourown.    The risk is that their uncertain performance so far - and particularlythe failure to get on top of their deficit - may not only add to our difficultiesbut tend in some quarters to discredit the policy instruments themselves.Yet in all essential respects, the fundamentals of United States policy, andours, are the same as those of virtually all our major Western partners.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn Annex A to this memorandum I describe how most countries - includingeven France under the Mitterrand Government - are having to tighten theirfiscal policies and cut their public expenditure plans.    It is quite wrong tosuggest that we are in some way out of step in attaching particular priorityto the long-term defeat of inflation, or in the methods we are using.PART IITHE UNITED KINGDOM ECONOMY(a)   The Present Position5. The latest indicators suggest that the fall in United Kingdom outputhas now come to an end.    Total output (Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) isnow expected to be about 2 per cent lower this year than in 1980, in line withthe forecast published at Budget-tirre, following a fall of about the sameamount in 1980.    Between the second half of 1979 and the first half of 1981GDP fell by about 5 per cent and manufacturing output by 16 per cent. Therecession has thus been the deepest since the 1930s.6. I described the reasons for this in my Cabinet paper in June (C(8l) 29).It is of course not a United Kingdom, but a world, recession.    But its depthhere springs largely from sharp increases in pay which, together with a highexchange rate, have reduced profits and competitiveness.   In each of thethree pay rounds from 1977-78 to 1979-80 money earnings increased by morethan 15 per cent while productivity showed little increase.    The resultingpressures on business finances contributed to substantial reducti  n3 in stocks,and export volumes declined.    Firms shed labour extensively to protect theirfinancial position.7. Virtually the whole burden of adjustment has so far been borne by theprivate sector, particularly manufacturing.    Output and employment in thepublic services showed little change between mid-1979 and mid-1981, outputin the private sector fell sharply, and employment there fell by almost1-| million.    This contrast in employment trends, together with higher publicsector pay increases, was reflected in a marked rise in the pay bill of thepublic sector in relation to the pay bill of the private sector.    Over the threeyears 1978-79 to 1981-82 the public services&apos; pay bill is likely to have risenby more than 60 per cent, or one-and-a-half times as fast as the privatesector&apos;s.    This has played a big part in the growth of public expenditure andin the consequent increases in the tax burden.    The figures are as follows:CONFIDENTIAL

Nonetheless, we have made progress this year towards a moresoundly based economy.    The growth of money national income and the rateof inflation have both been halved in the past eighteen months. Unemploy-ment, though much too high and still rising, is now rising more slowly. Paysettlements in the 1980-81 pay round averaged about 9 per cent, half the levelin the 1979-80 round.    There have also been  some impressive improvementsin productivity in both the public and private sectors, with considerableevidence of a change in attitudes to management and work practices, and a newreadiness to behave flexibly and realistically.    These developments,combined with the fall in the exchange rate, have eased the financialpressures on business.    The serious imbalance between the real disposableincome of persons and companies that developed in 1979 and 1980 as wagesraced ahead of prices has been partly corrected.    F robably more than halfthe loss of competitiveness between late 1979 and early 1981 has now beenregained.9. The general picture is thus of one of the economy adjusting to a lowerrate of inflation - but at a pace   that is frustratingly slow, especially inpolitical terms.(b)    Prospects for the Coming Year and Beyond10. The latest forecast suggests a slow recovery in output from mid-1981onwards, with GDP in 1982 about 1 per cent above the level expected this year.This should slow the rise in unemployment, but is unlikely to reverse it.The immediately dominant influence on output is likely to be the improvementin company finances, reflected in a slower run-down in stocks - though therecent increases in interest rates could have some adverse effect on this.Though personal real income is likely to fall, as pay increases keep belowthe rise in retail prices, consumption should be broadly maintained because3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof a further fall in the savings ratio from the exceptionally high levelsreached at the end of 1980.    Some recovery in investment could be seen asthe year goes on.11. There should be a lower rate of inflation before the end of 1982.However, mainly because of the fall in sterling, progress over the comingyear seems bound to be less rapid than had earlier been expected. Theprecise timing of this progress will obviously depend crucially on the comingpay round, and on the avoidance of further sharp falls in sterling or furtherincreases in the mortgage rate.    The general outlook for inflation is thus alittle worse than was assumed in September, though the worsened prospectfor retail prices should not be reflected in full in the prices paid by the publicsector.    But in the key areas of productivity, pay, competitiveness andprofitability, 1982 should produce further movement in the right direction.12. Looking further ahead, this promises a better prospect for growthin 1983 and beyond.    There are, of course, serious risks.    We could beaffected by events overseas over which we have no control - eg in the UnitedStates, the Middle East, or even in Poland.    The prospect could also be putin jeopardy by events at home, in particular a failure to achieve a low enoughoutturn on pay, or a break in confidence that forced interest rates still higheror brought a further sharp fall in sterling.    These domestic risks we can, andmust, guard against.    In this context our decisions on public expenditure areof crucial importance.PART IIIThe Framework for Policies and the Level of the Public Sector BorrowingRequirement (PSBR)13. Clearly we must do all we can to maintain the momentum towardslower inflation and to assist the adjustment of the economy.    We need to holddown the money supply and the growth of money incomes.    To ease domesticpressures on the financial markets, this will entail a further reduction in thePSBR next year.    But the adjustment of the economy would be much easier ifpublic expenditure were held to a total that not only permitted a low PSBRand thus lower interest rates, but also provided room for tax cuts which wouldreduce the upward pressures on costs and prices.    The faster inflation can bebrought down within the growth of nominal income, the greater the scope forincreases in real output and employment.14. If money supply is to be controlled without excessive interest rates,and if productive private sector investment is not to be squeezed out, theGovernment must borrow less.    This is why a reduction in the PSBR (as aproportion of GDP) must remain a central part of our strategy. Moreimmediately the strength of personal demand for credit, and the pressuresimposed on our own interest rates by high rates overseas, provide furthercompelling reasons for seeking a significantly lower PSBR next year.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL15. Recent figures for this year&apos;s PSBR have been distorted by the civilservants strike.    Both expenditure and tax revenues are higher thanexpected, the latter in part due to factors that are unlikely to be repeated.Adjusting for the strike effect, it would appear that overall the PSBR hasbeen broadly on the course expected at Budget time, ie about  10-| billionor 4^ per cent of GDP.    Some people argued at that time that this FSBR wasunduly restrictive;  though it in fact included an upward adjustment to takeaccount of the recession;  all that has happened since shows that ourdifficulties with money supply and interest rates would have been evengreater had I adopted a higher figure.16. In March 1980 a PSBR for 1982-83 of some  6 billion in current prices,or about 2^ per cent of GDP, looked right.    We have to adjust for the factthat economic activity is lower than we had expected when the path forreducing the PSBR over the medium-term was first set out.    To take accountof this, at the last Budget in March 1981 we raised the figure by 2. 5/ 3 billion.    I cannot sensibly justify a further increase.    There hassince been no further deterioration in the prospective level of output and ifwe were to pretend that there had been and make an adjustment larger thanthe facts demand, the upward pressures on interest rates could be serious.Not until the time of the next Budget will I be able to take a final view as towhat we should aim for.    But, particularly in view of the risks on interestrates and the effect on market confidence, I am convinced that we cannot atthis stage plan for a 1982-83 PSBR larger than some  9 billion (at currentprices), or about 3^ per cent of GDP, in line with what we have announced;indeed the possibility cannot be  excluded that when final decisions have to bemade, interest rate pressures will call for something lower.PART IVUne mpl o yment17.       Unemployment is clearly the most important political problem whichwe face.    Our firm belief on taking office, and drawing on the experience ofthe most successful industrial countries, was that sustainable growth inemployment could only come about through sustainable growth in output,which in turn depended on defeating inflation and improving the performanceof our industries - our two basic policy aims.    But progress towards ourobjectives has been slower than we hoped, partly because the world recessionhas been so sharp.    Some, understandably, now seek speedier remedies andshort-term solutions.    I wish there were one that made sense, but I don&apos;tbelieve there is.    I discuss below the two main suggestions that are now made.(a)    Spend More and Borrow More18.        It is frequently argued that a higher PSBR would help ernployrrent.But any such help would be marginal and temporary.   It is possible in theshort-run to increase employment by higher Government spending or lowertaxes, but only at the cost of sharply higher interest rates or worsenedinflation prospects that would before long cancel out the additional employment5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRecent Treasury estimates - and others have done similar analyses, andreached similar conclusions - suggest that additional spending on Governmentpurchases that raised the PSBR by  1 billion in 1982-83 would increase GDPby about \ per cent in 1983 and reduce unemployment by about 30, 000 by end1982 and 50, 000 by end 1983.    Interest rates, however, would rise by| - 1 percentage point and the prospect for inflation would be worsened.These adverse effects would become greater over time.    Largely for thesereasons, the gains to output and employment would be eliminated by the endof 1985.    These figures assume that market confidence would not be seriouslyshaken; if, a s is more likely, the markets reacted badly, the effects oninterest rates, inflation and perhaps the exchange rate could be substantiallybigger.    Fiscal reflation would bring no lasting political or social gains interms of unemployment.    It would damage the prospects for sustainablegrowth and put at risk the benefit of the efforts we have already made. Itwould, in short, be a high risk policy with a very uncertain and very short-term possible reward.19. The above calculations take account of the &quot;second round&quot; effectsincluding indirect effects on social security payments, tax receipts, etc.For any change in fiscal policy the relationship between the gross cost of themeasures, its PSBR cost and the effects on interest rates is complex.    As ageneral rule the PSBR might be expected to rise less than the gross amountof the additional expenditure, because of savings in unemployment benefit andadditional receipts of taxes as a result of the expenditure.    However theadditional expenditure would also raise costs and prices and the cost of debtservicing.    This increased debt servicing cost would reflect both the highervolume of public sector debt outstanding and the higher level of interest ratesneeded to keep the growth of money supply on track.    When all this is takeninto account it substantially reduces, and will in time probably outweigh, thebeneficial secondary effects of expenditure on the PSBR.    I include a moredetailed analysis of this point at Annex B to this memorandum.20. When account is taken of these indirect effects on the PSBR and theirimplications for future years, the notion that extra public expenditure canlargely be self-financing would appear unfounded.    Similarly a cut in publicexpenditure, even in a labour intensive category, will usually significantlyreduce the PSBR or within a given PSBR leave room for tax savings. Theassertion frequently made that the Government could create more employment,or protect existing employment, at relatively small cost is unhappily notsupported by the facts.(b)   Spend More and Tax More21. Within a given PSBR there is of course scope for a trade-off betweentax and expenditure.    Given our limited room for manoeuvre this trade-offis of critical importance.    In present circumstances there is particularadvantage in tax cuts that lower prices or costs.    In the short-run these wouldbe likely to have much the same effect on employment as equivalent increasesin public spending on goods and services (unless that spending were concentra-ted on increasing public service manpower, which is the reverse of our policy).In neither case would the addition to employment be more than marginal.But the tax route would bring quick and lasting benefits to inflation and industry.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL22. Recent Treasury analysis of policy options implies that an increaseof   1 billion in expenditure would generally require an increase of more thanf 1 billion in tax to neutralise its effects on interest rates.    The precisetrade-off would depend on the type of expenditure and ta?- being changed,since different types of taxes and expenditures have different economiceffects, especially in relation to nominal interest rates.    Conversely, areduction of   1 billion in public expenditure would generally permit a reductionof more than this amount in taxes.23. Our estimates suggest that extra Government spending on goods andservices or a cut in price-reducing taxes such as the National InsuranceSurcharge (NIS) having broadly the same effect on interest rates would bothreduce unemployment by about the same amount.    But the tax cuts routewould help to bring down prices whereas increases in public spending wouldtend to put them up.   This is because the effects of higher activity on payincreases and the exchange rate would not be compensated for by anyreduction in labour costs or retail prices of the sort that would be producedby the tax cuts.    For this reason, and because their prospective profitabilitywill be more carefully assessed, increases in employment generated by taxcuts should be more sustainable than those generated by higher publicspending.(c) Conclusion24. There are thus no quick or easy answers to the unemploymentproblem.   If we were to go for either (a) or (b) above, we would be creatingnew difficulties on inflation and interest rates, without making any significantimpact on the unemployment totals during the lifetime of this Parliament.That being so, the better course is to stick to policies aimed at long-termsolutions.    The root causes of unemployment lie in low productivity,competitiveness, and incentives.    I am sure that we have to continue toattack the problem at its roots.    Simply to throw money at it would not help,though we must take care to ensure that our reluctance here is not miscon-strued as unwillingness to help.PART VTax and Expenditure25. Against this background we have to balance tax and expenditureconsiderations.    Within a given PSBR more public expenditure means moretaxation and less public expenditure less taxation.    We came to office pledgedto reduce both, but we have found, like all our predecessors and allGovernments overseas, that progress this way is enormously difficult. Thetable in paragraph 7 above illustrates how we have been forced to go in thewrong direction on both, and how private sector employment has borne thebrunt of the recession.26. The rise in the tax burden can be illustrated in terms of its effects onindividuals:-7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALi. A married man on average earnings now pays 48^ per centof his income in taxes and contributions of all kinds compared with45 per cent when we took office.ii. The income tax : threshold for a married man has droppedto just over a quarter of average earnings;  at  41 per week it isonly  3 above the supplementary benefit rate.And we have done less than we hoped to ease the tax burden on companycosts and profits.27. Our starting point must be a determination not to increase the realburden of taxation;  to do so would be an obviously retrograde step, not leastin the context of unemployment.    My present forecasts assume that in mynext Budget income tax thresholds will be raised in line with inflation, aswill the excise duties;  and National Insurance contributions will rise tobalance the National Insurance Fund.    None of us would I think want to doless on the thresholds or more on the indirect taxes.    I naturally should alsolike on top of this to be able to make some reduction in the real burden oftaxation.    There are two areas which are particularly pressed upon me;the company sector, where a reduction in the National Insurance Surchargewould ease the strain on costs and prices and would make for greater outputand more jobs;  and income tax thresholds, where in my last Budget I wasunable to give any increase in line with inflation, and where action would alsohelp with unemployment, by increasing the incentive to work.28. Within a given PSBR the key lies in the public expenditure totals. Asexplained in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper C(81) 51 our present public expendi-ture plans, starting from the Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 8175) ofearlier this year, imply the following expenditure totals:-Planning totals   billion cash1982-83      1983-84 1984-85109.9 H3.9 U9.6If we were able to achieve these totals we could lighten the tax load onindustry, enterprise and endeavour.    Apart from that, we said in Cmnd 8175that the totals it set out were higher than we would wish:  any increase inthem would be politically difficult.    More important, it could well be damagingto confidence.    The economic and political imperatives point towards keepingour plans within these figures.29. Nevertheless, I recognise the pressures which spending colleaguesface.    I recognise too the difficulties posed by decisions we have alreadytaken and announced (such as the unemployment measures announced in thesummer) and the way certain programmes (eg Defence and parts of the SocialSecurity programme) have been regarded as substantially immune from thesearch for economies.    Elsewhere we are faced with problems not of ourmaking.    The problem with the local authorities, for example, is to containoverspend rather than to get spending lower than we had planned.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL30.       The Chief Secretc-ry has had discussions with spending Ministers.In the light of these discussions he and I are prepared to accept that thepolitical and other costs of getting back to the White Paper revalued wouldnot be tolerable.    On the other hand, I am sure that we cannot go forward ona basis which implies now a further real increase in the tax burden in mynext Budget.    We cannot, therefore, go anywhere near accepting all theadditional bids which spending colleagues have made - they would lead to anincrease of over  7 billion for 1982-83.    Balancing these tax and expenditureconsiderations, we therefore propose the following totals as the maximum towhich we could agree :-Planning totals   billion cash1982-83 1983-84113.5 118.1The figure for 1984-85 generated by carrying forward existing policies, aschanged by our proposals, is  124.8 billion.    For the reasons set out in theChief Secretary&apos;s paper, we suggest that officials should study further howto reduce it.31. We recognise that the decisions required to reach these totals willcause difficulty and some unpopularity.    But this has to be balanced againstthe adverse effects in the market and on confidence in our policies caused byan even greater excess over Cmnd 8175, and also by the unpopularity of theconsequent increases in taxes.    I should emphasise that, after allowing forhigher revenue than was expected at Budget time, in line with this year&apos;sbuoyancy, even these spending totals would leave us with some risk on theinterest and tax front, and certainly make it quite impossible for me at thisstage to hold out any reliable hope of tax reductions - for instance on the NISand a real increase in tax thresholds - in my next Budget.    We should haveto be a lot nearer Cmnd 8175 for us to have any confident expectation thatthese would be feasible.32. The implications of these totals for tax changes in 1983 and 1984 arenecessarily still less certain.    But, consistent with the overall improvementin economic prospects foreseen in paragraph 12 above, on present forecaststhese totals should leave room for useful tax reductions in those later years.If such scope materialises - and we cannot yet count on it - I would aim totake fiscal action of a type which would further assist our fight againstinflation and our efforts to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of ourindustries.PART VIConclusion33. I     This note seeks to set out the factors relevant to decisions aboutpublic expenditure in 1982-83 and later years.    Notably these must turn onour overall economic plans and prospects.    We must continue to maintain asound monetary and fiscal line, so as to contain inflation and interest rates.It is a delusion to think that any alternative economic strategy would, within9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe lifetime of this Parliament, lead to any substantially better outturn.Relaxing our policies would only harm confidence at home and abroad.The immediate economic prospects are for a slower improvement than wehad hoped, with inflation coming down more slowly than expected, andunemployment remaining disturbingly high.    There are, however, encourag-ing signs on output and the longer-term prospects give ground for guardedoptimism.    Immediately we should plan for a PSBR for 1982-83 not greaterthan the level we foresaw in this year&apos;s Budget.    We cannot go for publicexpenditure totals which imply a real rise in the tax burden in the nextBudget.    Although there will be some political damage in it, I reluctantlyaccept that s me increase in the public expenditure plans announced inCmnd8l75 is inevitable.    But the totals set out in paragraph 30 above arethe maximum we can afford if we are not on course for increases in taxesin the next Budget.    Indeed even figures as high as these leave some risk onthis score.    If we want to have a reasonable chance of being able to makesome useful reduction in real taxes - eg a cut in the NIS or real improvementin thresholds - we should need figures substantially nearer Cmnd 8175. ButI accept the serious problems this would give my spending colleagues.34.       I invite my colleagues to agree that the public expenditure planningtotals for 1982-83 and 1983-84 should be held to those set out inparagraph 30 above.G HTreasury Chambers14 October 198110CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALannex aThe International Background1. The United Kingdom is not alone in suffering stubborn inflation, sluggishoutput and rising unemployment.   It is also not alone in the hard decisions itis having to take on public spending in order to deal with them.2. Consumer prices in the major seven OECD economies continued 10 per centhigher in July than a year ago.   France and Italy suffered appreciably higherrates - 13 per cent and 19 per cent respectively.    The OECD Secretariat&apos;slatest forecasts suggest that all the major European economies will have loweroutput this year than last year with even such traditionally strong countriesas Germany showing a fall in GDP.   Unenployment, too, has been rising in allEurope&apos;s big economies and, after a short pause, there has also been afurther rise in unemployment in the United States.3. The world&apos;s money and currency markets have shown sharp fluctuations inrecent months with steep increases in interest rates and large movements inexchange rates.   Short-term interest rates in the United States which roseto over 18 per cent in the summer, have since eased back but remain histori-cally high at 15^ per cent, reflecting the conflicting pressures for fundsbetween the private sector and a Federal Budget deficit still apparently toohigh.   Prime industrial borrowers are paying 18-19 per cent.    Interest ratesin other countries which rose in the wake of American rates, have so fareased back only gradually and in many cases remain very high in real terms.4. There have been increasing signs of readiness on the part of most governmentsto persevere with firm policies to halt and then reverse these worrying trends.In particular, governments are continuing with their efforts to control monetarygrowth, curb their budget deficits and keep public spending in check to lay thebasis for renewed growth without inflation.5. It is not easy to reverse the trends of the 1950s and 1960s which saw anincreasing share of national income in many countries taken by public spending,ft is also not popular - though victories by parties committeed to curbingpublic spending in the United States, Sweden, Norway and Australia in the1.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpast two years suggest that electorates, too, are increasingly aware of theneed to curb public spending.   The French choice of a Socialist governmentwith radically different policies is the main exception, although even therean important group in the French Cabinet is arguing for prudence, and F Fr15 billion of public investment projects for next year have been frozen.6. In most industrial countries budgetary measures in the current year havereflected determination to prevent the recession adding to deficits. TheOECD Secretariat&apos;s analysis of the policies of 22 members shows that abouttwo-thirds have been trying to cut public spending plans this year. Onlya handful (5 including France) announced higher spending.7. Looking to next year and beyond many countries are seeking to secure alasting reduction in their budget deficdts.   President Reagan has repeatedhis determination to keep the federal government&apos;s deficit down to $43 billionin the 1982-83 fiscal year and to balance the budget by 1984.   The governmentsof Germany, and the Netherlands are seeking to reduce their budget deficitsnext year as a percentage of GNP.    The Irish and Swedish governments haveannounced plans to put their deficits on a declining trend over the medium-term.    The recent Australian budget introduced measures to eliminate thefederal deficit entirely next year.8. The drive to reduce budget deficits has involved many governments in harddecisions on public spending.   The US Administration is seeking furtherreductions of $13 billion next year in planned spending in addition to the$35 billion cuts already agreed by Congress in the summer.   The German govern-ment has announced cuts of DM 10 billion in spending plans.   The Italians areseeking cuts of 9,700 billion lire.   The Swedes have proposed budget savings ofKr 6 billion and the new coalition in the Netherlands is seeking cuts of 4.5billion guilders.9. Countries have of course chosen different priorities in seeking economies.However, in many countries programmes once considered sacrosanct have comeunder keen scrutiny in the new situation:Spending on social security is being curbed in a number ofcountries, with tougher eligibility rules for unemploymentpay, food stamps and other benefits in the United States,2.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrestrictions on child benefits in Germany and Belgium, andproposals for cuts in planned social security spending in theNetherlands.The US government is cutting planned spending on health andMedicaid, as well as the training of doctors and nurses.Hospital beds are being reduced in the Netherlands and Belgium,who are also raising prescription charges and cutting hospitalbuilding programmes.   Germany, too, is raising prescriptioncharges and seeking economies in other treatment costs. Italyis increasing charges, and has halted recruitment to thenational health service.   Ireland, too, is seeking savings onhealth programmes   with higher hospital and prescription charges.Planned spending on education is being lowered in the Netherlands,Belgium and Italy.    The US has placed tight ceilings on educationspending, including curbs on student loans and restrictions on thefunds available to subsidise school meals.   Ireland has increaseduniversity fees.Housing budgets are being cut back in Sweden and the Netherlands.Mortgage subsidies are being reduced in Ireland.Transfers from central government to local authorities are beingrestricted in a number of countries including the United Statesand Sweden.   In Sweden this is designed specifically to affectauthorities that fail to keep to spending targets.Staff savings in public administration are a common objectiveof many governments.   President Reagan is seeking to reducethe number of public employees by 75,000 in 19-82.   The Germangovernment is looking for a 1 per cent reduction in publicservants.   The Dutch are seeking a real reduction in publicsector salaries as well as changes to public pension arrangements.3-CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDefence spending, which is being given priority by manygovernments, has not been exempt from retrenchment plans.The ambitious US defence programme has been trimmed. Swedenis reducing its planned defence budget, and the Belgians haveproposed a moratorium on defence projects.   Germany hasabandoned the NATO 3 per cent target.10. Among countries which have announced their budgets for next year, onlythe Danes and the French have overtly adopted expansionary policies.   In boththese countries, this year&apos;s budget deficits already seem likely to be signifi-cantly greater than planned and next year&apos;s deficits are projected to increaseby around 25 per cent.    The French have in addition tacitly abandoned themonetary targets of the previous administration.11. The risks of these strategies are evident.   In both Denmark and France,inflation is running well above the OECD average.   The French have been forcedto devalue.   Price controls are being reintroduced in France.

CONF I Dl&apos;JIIT I AJjANNEX BTHE IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC FINANCES OF ADDITIONALPUBLIC EXPENDITURE ON MANPOWERB1 Because the cost to the government of unemployment isso high it is sometimes asserted that additional publicexpenditure that creates employment has a very low cost if theresulting savings on unemployment benefit etc. are taken intoaccount.    The converse has been asserted also, namely that cutsin public expenditure that involve an immediate and direct lossof employment produce little benefit for public finances. ThisAnnex therefore considers the implications for public financesof additional public expenditure.B2 Estimates of the total cost of additional publicexpenditure of a particular type will vary according to itsprecise nature and whether it is offset by an increase in taxes.Paragraph 22 of the above paper assessed the implications ifthere is an offsetting change to tax rates.    This Annex extendsthe analysis in paragraph 18 which assessed the consequencesto the economy if there is no such offsetting increase totax rates.BJ Expenditure on manpower has a greater initial impact onunemployment than the other main categories of public expenditure.To illustrate the implications of extra public expenditure thathas a favourable direct effect on unemployment, this Annextherefore examines the effects of additional expenditure onmanpower.     It should be remembered, however, that this is acategory of expenditure the government are committed to reduce.(It is claimed that certain categories of special employmentmeasures have lower net public expenditure and FSBR coststhan expenditure on wages and salaries, but there is considerableuncertainty as to the precise effects of these measures inreducing unemployment.    In addition most of them seriouslydistort the labour market in ways that it is not possible toquantify, but which reduce their attractiveness.)B4- The calculations summarised here assess the overalleconomic effects and the impact on public finances - especially- 1 -
CONFIDENTIAIthe effect on total public expenditure and the PSBR - of anadditional  1 billion of central government expenditure onmanpower (ie wages and salaries).    It is assumed that the extraexpenditure is, in the first instance, on extra employmentand not on higher pay, though, as paragraph B9 shows, one ofthe many possible side effects of the extra expenditure ishigher wages and prices.    It is assumed that the extra centralgovernment employment is maintained in later years.    In practicean increase in expenditure on employment would almost certainlyinvolve a related increase in public expenditure on procurementand possibly on capital expenditure as well.    The calculationsbelow assume that there is no such increase in publicexpenditure.    They   are therefore likely to overstate the directgain to employment of an extra  1 billion of public expenditure.B5 Host analysis of the costs of unemployment, and there-fore of the benefits of measures that reduce it, concentrateson certain easily identified direct consequences for publicfinances.    Thus the Treasury article &quot;Costing unemployment&quot;(Economic Progress Report, February 1981) presented estimatesof the effects of a change in unemployment on receipts of(i)    income tax,(ii)   National Insurance and other contributions,and(iii)   the National Insurance Surcharge,and expenditure on(i)   National Insurance and other social securitybenefits,(ii)   rent and rate rebates,and (iii)    other administrative costs.B6 As the article recognised, these readily identifieddirect effects do not give the full picture.    There are othercomponents of receipts and expenditure that vary with the stateof the economy.   An increase in public expenditure on manpowerwill have implications for the behaviour of the economy - eg oninterest rates, the levels of wages and prices, the exchangerate etc.   Not all these effects will be strong in the first- 2 -
year in which the additional public expenditure takes place,but will build up through successive years.   For this reasonestimates of the direct effects on public finances in the firstyear will not show the full consequences of additional publicexpenditure.    Table B1 summarises the effects of the assumedadditional public expenditure on interest rates, the EPI, GDPand total unemployment.B7 Table B2 compares the direct effects in the firstyear of an additional  1 billion of central government expenditureon manpower with estimates of the total effects over a fouryear period.    The estimates of the total effects assume:-(a) No change in the growth of the moneysupply; interest rates will therefore risein response to increases in the demand formoney;(b) A freely floating exchange rate;(c) Average earnings in the economy determinedby the supply of and demand for labour;and   (d)   Fixed real tax rates and allowances (ie nominaltax allowances and specific duties are raisedretrospectively in line with increases in the EPI).B8 Ther&lt;. are certain obvious differences between theestimates of the total and direct costs.(i)    the debt interest cost of the additionalexpenditure rises steadily over the four years,reflecting both the higher PSBR and the higherinterest rates.    &apos;    There is no allowances forthis in the direct costings;(1) If the calculations in Tables B1 and B2 were on the assumptionof fixed interest rates rather than fixed money supply the debtinterest cost of the extra public expenditure would not rise asmuch as in Table B2.   However, with unchanged interest ratesextra public expenditure would entail a higher money supply andtherefore higher inflation.- 3 -
(ii) By increasing activity and pressurein the labour market higher public expenditurewill tend to raise both prices and wages.Although this adds to tax and National Insurancereceipts, it also raises the price of publicexpenditure (and causes social security upratingsto be higher than they would otherwise have been);(iii) the calculations of the total effects ofhigher public expenditure assume that the receiptsand outgoings of the National Insurance fund arebalanced by varying rates of contribution. Lowerexpenditure on unemployment benefit will thereforelead to lower contribution rates than would otherwisehave been the case.    The alternative assumption ofunchanged contribution rates, which is made in thedirect costings in Table B2 and in the EconomicProgress Report, would lower the PSBR cost of extraemployment by  l80m in 1982-83, and by a similarabsolute amount in later years.    This alternativeassumption would imply an excess of receipts overexpenditure for the National Insurance Fund. Inpractice contribution rates would change to offsetthis, hence the conventional assumption.-(iv) Average earnings in central government areapproximately 11 per cent higher than in theprivate sector.    The   calculations in the tableassume that the additional central governmentemployees receive average central government pay.If the pay of the additional staff were lower anadditional  1 billion of expenditure would have a(1)greater initial effect on employment^    .    One consequencewould be greater savings on unemployment and socialsecurity benefits.   With lower than average central(1) At the extreme it has been suggested that public works j&apos;obscould be created paying wages equal to the benefit rate grossedup for tax flow backs. Whatever the political feasibility of thisproposal, it would not be possible to attract people to workunless some premium over their benefit rate was paid.    Indeed thepeople who would have most incentive to take these jobs would bethose with low entitlement to benefit.   Any feasible scheme wouldtherefore have a significant PSBR cost.- i\- -
CONFIDENTIALgovernment earnings for the additional manpower, andhence a larger fall in unemployment there could,however, he a stronger tendency for earnings -including those of public sector workers - to rise.B9- The estimates in the table clearly depend crucially onhow prices and wages react to higher public expenditure. Theassumption is that cash planning factors hold in the first year,but that thereafter they are set broadly to reflect the prospectsfor inflation in the economy.   Any increase in public expenditureon manpower will cause an immediate stimulus to output and areduction in unemployment.    Table B1 shows, however, thatthis effect will diminish over the four year period as a resultof higher interest rates on the one hand, and higher prices andearnings on the other.    While employment by the central governmentis, by hypothesis, higher and has an immediate impact or.unemployment this is offset, by an amount that increases throughthe period, by lower private sector output and employment whichreduces the fall in unemployment.    By the end of the period theaddition to GDP has almost disappeared.   Because employment andunemployment adjust with a lag to changes in output the table doesnot show the full extent to which the erosion of the increase inGDP would eventually have a similar effect on the fall inunemployment.    The estimates in Table B2 would be&apos; different if itcould be assumed that the extra public expenditure and borrowinghad no effect on the prices of the various categories of publicexpenditure.    The adverse effects on public finances of the extrapublic expenditure would be much reduced.    Such an assumptionwould, however, be unrealistic in the light of past experience.B10 Table B2 shows, on the assumptions set out above, theestimated direct and indirect effects on puiblic finances ofadditional public expenditure.    These estimates indicate thatafter taking account of all the consequences for public financesof the additional public expenditure,(a)    the increase to total public expenditure inthe first year is higher than the increase inexpenditure on manpower;- 5 -
CONFIDENTIAL(b)    the PSBR cost in the first year is lessthan the direct increase to public expenditure(though greater than the PSBR cost in the directestimate );and       (c)   both the total public expenditure cost andthe PSBR cost rise steadily through the fouryears; by the end of the period the PSBR cost(in cash) exceeds the initial direct increasein public expenditure.

In 1983-84 and subsequentyears,the initial increase in expenditure is raised in line withinflation to maintain the stimulus to Central Government employment.The general government wage and salary bill will however increaseby more than this, because higher wage inflation will increase cashexpenditure on existing manpower plans.    (For the first years,however, because cash limits hold this effect from higher wageinflation is offset by a squeeze on manpower.)Other Final Consumption   Higher costs and prices will lead toincreased cash expenditure on an unchanged volume of currentconsumption in years after 1982-83-    (See paragraphAs paragraph B4- makes clear there is no allowance for higherexpenditure on procurement or capital that an increase inexpenditure on manpower would probably involve.   Similarly thereis no allowance for saving on administrative costs that lowerexpenditure on unemployment and social security benefits wouldmake possible.    (This effect was included in the February EFRcostings.)Unemployment and social Security Benefits.   Over time the initialimprovement in unemployment tends to be offset by the adversesecond-round effects of higher interest rates and inflation, thusreducing the initial savings on these benefit payments.Cther Current Grants and Subsidies. Higher inflation increases thecosts of benefit upratings.Debt Interest Expenditure.    This increases because(a) the outstanding volume of government debtis growing due to the cumulative impact of higherPSBRs;(b) interest rates are higher to finance thehigher PSBR without expanding the money supply.

Savings on national insurance benefits to the unemployedare therefore passed on in the form of lower contribution rates.Income Tax and Indirect Taxes.    These increase due to increases inthe tax base from the higher numbers employed and increases inconsumers&apos;  expenditure and also because prices and wages arehigher.- 3 -
