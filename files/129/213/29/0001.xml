CONFIDENTIALD0CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 5410 November 1981CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT SETTLEMENT 1982-83Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department1. In order for my Ministerial Group, MISC 21, to reach conclusionson the Rate Support Grant (RSG) settlement for 1982-83 I have to ask theCabinet to decide now on three main questions:   the total of local authoritycurrent expenditure in 1982-83;   current and capital housing expenditure;and the RSG percentage.    This paper is primarily in terms of the Englishsettlement but, in the light of Cabinet&apos;s decisions, I believe that the Ministersdirectly concerned can settle the remaining detailed issues on the settlementand the implications for Scotland and for Wales.TOTAL LOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE, EXCEPT HOUSING2. At their meeting on 24 September (CC(81) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 4),the Cabinet agreed that further work on the RSG settlement for 1982-83should be on the three alternative assumptions of real reductions from1981-82 of 7 per cent, as implied by present plans, and of 4 and of 3 per cent;they agreed to take a final decision on the total when they considered the 1981Public Expenditure Survey.    Fending this decision, and the Secretary ofState for the Environment&apos;s advice on the attitude of the local authority leadersthe Chief Secretary, Treasury   allowed, in his memorandum (C(81) 51) onpublic expenditure, for the highest of the three options;   this impliesadditional cash expenditure in 1982-83 of  940 million for Great Britain, andan increase for England of  780 million, to about  17,800 million.Recognising that even with this increase for realism the local authoritieswould still probably overspend on their targets, the Chief Secretary, Treasuryallowed for a further expected overspend of  500 million (Great Britain),though not with the intention of revealing this figure to the local authorities.3. The local authority leaders have since told the Secretary of State forthe Environment that, although many individual authorities remain keen to stayin line with the Government&apos;s expenditure plans, the Associations do not havethe kind of control over their members that would enable them to enter intomeaningful commitments about any particular level of reduction of localauthority expenditure as a whole.    The Secretary of State for the Environmenthas now advised that the total of  17, 800 million for England would probablyrequire a volume reduction not of 3 per cent but of 5 to 7 per cent;   this isbecause further information on outturn in 1980-81 since 24 September suggests1COPY NOCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthat, contrary to expectation, there is unlikely to be significant shortfall onbudgeted expenditure in 1981-82, and, additionally, there could be volumesqueeze from the use of the general public sector cash factors. TheSecretary of State for the Environment considers that a reduction of this sizewould not be realistic, and that to propose targets for individual authoritiesbased on such unrealistic aggregates would be counter-productive. Heproposes that  350 million should be transferred from the Chief Secretary,Treasury&apos;s allowance for overspending of  500 million to give a total forEngland of  18, 150 million (and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and forWales would expect corresponding transfers to be mn.&apos;ie to their programmes).The Secretary of State for the Environment advises that even this total wouldrepresent a tough target, requiring local authorities to limit the increase intheir total (Block Grant and rate borne) expenditure in cash terms to1 per cent over its 1981-82 level.4. On the face of it, this transfer from the overspending allowance to theallocated local authority targets should not lead to any net increase in theplanned total of public expenditure.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury is,however, opposed to it.    He judges  that, in practice, there would be a netincrease because the pressure on the local authorities to control theirexpenditure would have been relaxed, as would the pressure on them to insiston reasonable pay settlements.    Moreover, in his view, the reasonssuggested by the Secretary of State for the Environment for expecting higherexpenditure mean that, unless the RSG percentage is significantly reducedfrom its present level, total local authority expenditure, including over-spending, will be higher than previously expected whatever the target is,Against that, some Ministers argue that, if the higher total is agreed, it canbe translated into realistic individual targets for each authority backed by asystem providing for substantial holdback of grant from authorities who chooseto overspend;  whereas on the lower expenditure total it would be impossibleto produce credible individual targets and so the holdoack scheme mightbackfire- in the sense that all authorities would be affected by it and thescheme might not be sustainable.    The local authority elections next year willfurther deter the authorities affected (mainly London boroughs) from spendingmore and rating higher.    Essentially, the question for Cabinet is which is themore realistic approach and the more likely to deter local authorities fromoverspending and rating high.HOUSING5. To arrive at the totals of Block Grant and of individual targets it isnecessary to decide on council house rent assumptions which in turn affect thetotal of housing subsidies and the level of the housing revenue accounts;eligibility for grant depends in part on compliance with these assumptions.6. The total housing expenditure in 1982-83 implied by the last PublicExpenditure White Paper is  3,869 million.    No distribution of this totalbetween subsidies and capital investment has been published or agreed. Tomaintain the 1981-82 volume of capital, management and inainte*a*ceexpenditure within this total would require an increase of around  4 * wook os.the prteent Average council house rent in England of  11. 50.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. The Chief Secretary, Treasury proposes savings of  93 million onthis total and he has suggested that these might be achieved by a combinationof rent increases of  4. 30 a week and a 2 per cent reduction in capitalexpenditure.    He would accept a judgment that rent increases should be lower,provided that net savings were then achieved by correspendingly biggerreductions in the capital programme.    Each lOp by which the average rentincrease is reduced adds  15 million to public expenditure;  and, if the totalof housing expenditure is not to increase, must be offset by a  15 million cutin housing investment.8. The Secretary of State for the Environment points out that an averageincrease in rents of  4 a week, or 35 per cent, would result in a 1 per centrise in the Retail Price Index which would have an impact on other publicexpenditure programmes.    An average  4 increase across English authoritiesas a whole would result in some smaller increases but in 66 individual .authorities increases would average over  5 and, in a few cases, wouldapproach  10.    The Secretary of State for the Environment considers that anincrease of about  l. 50, or 13 per cent, is the maximum that would bedefensible.9. Even increases of  1. 50 would lead to surpluses on the HousingRevenue Accounts (HRAs) of many authorities.    Tenants of these authoritieswill appear to be subsidising ratepayers in the provision of local services andthis will lead to strong criticism, by Conservative controlled authorities amongothers.    The Secretary of State for the Environment is accordingly proposingchanges in the treatment of these surpluses;   this is being discussedseparately with the Chief Secretary, Treasury.10. The Secretary of State for the Environment further argues that, by1981-82, provision for housing capital investment had already been reducedby 45 per cent, compared with outturn in 1979-80;   this represents most of theGovernment&apos;s total reductions in capital expenditure since 1979-80.    He pointsout that, in the meantime, the total number of households has been growing ata net rate of 150, 000 a year, that housing capital expenditure has a high job-generation benefit, and that the increase of housing capital from its presentlevel is essential to the Government&apos;s low-cost home-ownership and homeimprovement policies.    He considers that housing capital expenditure shouldbe increased, rather than reduced to accommodate lower rent increases.11. The Secretary of State for the Environment also advises that localauthority expenditure on management and maintenance in 1981-82 is likelysubstantially to exceed provision.    He recommends that provision for 1982-83should be based on the likely level of outturn in 1981-82, in the way he hasalready proposed for local authority current expenditure generally, with areduction of 3 per cent in real terms.12. To maintain the volume of capital at its 1981-82 level, with anaverage rent increase of  l. 50 a week,   would require an increase of 375 million on the present total of  3, 869 million with an additional 67 million if provision for management and maintenance is increased asproposed by the Secretary of State for the Environment.    Setting the total of3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL 442 million against the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s   proposal for a cut of 93 million leaves a gap of  535 million.    These figures take no account ofany further bid that may be required in the light of the Secretary of State forthe  Environment&apos;s discussion with the Chief Secretary, Treasury   of thetreatment of HRA surpluses, and are on the assumption of no volume increasein housing capital expenditure.    The questions for Cabinet are what should bethe total provision for housing and, within that, what should be assumed forincreases in council house rents and for housing capital and maintenanceexpenditure.RSG PERCENTAGE13. Once the total relevant expenditure has been calculated, a decisionhas to be taken on the percentage of it to be financed by the RSG.    In 1981-82it was 59. 1 per cent.    In view of the higher expenditure now planned for1982-83, and to reinforce the pressure on the local authorities to curb theirexpenditure, there is a case for a lower percentage this year.    A balance hasto be struck here:   a lower percentage should encourage all authorities tospend less but some authorities may not reduce their expenditure by the sameamount as the cash reduction in grant, so the reduced percentage could alsolead tfj substantial rate increases, even for authorities that spend on target.14. MISC 21 agreed that the alternative expenditure assumptions shouldeach by exemplified in detail by the Department of the Environment on thebasis of an RSG of 54 per cent.    I have agreed that these exemplificationsshould be circulated separately.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury wouldaccept 54 per cent only if the assumptions on local authority currentexpenditure and housing in C(8l) 51 were maintained;  otherwise he wouldrecommend 50 per cent.CONCLUSIONS15. If, as Cabinet have agreed, the RSG settlement is to be announcedbefore Christmas, it is essential to take decisions on these questions as soonas possible.    I invite the Cabinet to decide for the English RSG settlement in1982-83:-i. whether the total of local authority current expenditure inEngland should be  17,800 million allocated to individual localauthority targets with  500 million (Great Britain) as an allowancefor overspending, or  18, 150 million with a different allowance(paragraphs 2 to 4 above);ii. what should be the total for housing expenditure -  442 millionmore, or  93 million less, than the present provision of  3,869 million;what should be the average council house rent increase;  and whatshould be the planned expenditure on housing capital and maintenance;(paragraphs 5 to 12 above);CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALiii.       depending on the answers to the first two questions, whatshould be the RSG percentage (paragraphs 13 and 14);and to agree that MISC 21 should have authority to settle the remainingdetailed issues for England, and the implications for Scotland and for WaleW WHome Office10 November 19815CONFIDENTIAL
