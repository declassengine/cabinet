CONFIDENTIALIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 58 COPY NO7 December 1981CABINETINDEX-LINKED PENSIONS:  FOLLOW-UP TO THE SCOTT REPORTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerINTRODUCTION1. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy considered this on15 July and concluded that:a. The assumption should be that any changes made would apply toall public sector groups with index-linked pensions.b. Any legislation w uld have to be taken through Parliament in the1981-82 Session (with consideration being given to use of the 1982Finance Bill).c. The options to be examined for the final round should be;i. Option A;  a straight increase in contributions to a unifiedlevel of 9 per cent or 10 per cent.ii. Option B:  leaving the existing contribution structure broadlyunchanged but levying in addition a specific charge for index-linking related to its current cost and private sector practice.iii. Option C:   an automatic cut-off on the degree of indexing inany year.iv. Option D:   a discretionary power, subject to AffirmativeResolution, to increase pensions by less than inflation in any year.2. The report by the Official Committee on the Value of Pensions (attachedas Annex A) examines these options m the light of our earlier comments. Apublic statement is expected of us soon and we now need to reach agreement onwhat to do.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3. A table showing the numbers of pensioners in different parts of thepublic services and the relative costs, and the total numbers of pensioners inthe public services and nationalised industries, is attached an Annex B,GENERAL, APPROACH4. In deciding what to do it is important to lock at the problem in the widercontext of pensions generally - in the private as well as the public sector.There is serious doubt whether the present level of benefits in the privatesector can be funded without serious detriment to the financial position of manyof the companies concerned.     It is likely, too, that the cost of the earnings-related element in the National Insurance pension will impose very considerablefinancial problems in the years to come.    Public concern is already beingexpressed about these matters.     The forthcoming reports of the GovernmentActuary on the quinquennial review of the State scheme and on contracting outwill focus further attention on the matter.     It may be necessary to consider thestructure of benefits as well as of contributions and we should take &lt; are toensure that the action we took on public sector pensions should not appear to beinappropriate in the wider context.5. In the matter of pensions, as in other things, inflation has producedinjustice.     The effect of inflation has been to lighten the real burden on privatesector employers of providing pensions, because for the most part they do notgive full indexation; at the same time, it has reduced the value of thosepensions.     By contrast, the burden of maintaining pensions in the public sectorhas not changed in real terms - and has thus increased relatively;   but thisburden is carried by the community as a whole, mainly through taxation. Norhave public sector pensioners suffered from inflation in the way that mostprivate sector pensioners - and many others - have.6. In the private sector practice varies considerably.     At one extremethere are those who have pension rights in money terms and get little or noadjustment for inflation; at the other extreme, there are some who do get fullinflation-proofing in practice, though without any formal right to it. Themajority lies somewhere between these two extremes.     The most striking (andmost widely perceived) difference between the two sectors is the guarantee ofindex-linking in one and its virtual absence in the other.     Yet when we haveconsidered the issue in the past we have been driven (mainly, but not entirely,for political reasons) to the conclusion that this is the one thing that cannot Inchanged - that index-linking cannot be touched.     There may be no est ape fromthat conclusion.     But I believe we should at least consider the alternative,BENEFITS7. The Official Committee identified two broad approaches towards Limitinginflation-proofing.     The first (Option C) involves an automatic cut-off (theprecise formula could be defined in many ways).      The aim would be that, onceset, the formula might avoid the difficulty of an annual decision.     On the other2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhand, however it were devised, its automatic operation would be bound to seeminappropriate in some years, and pressure would mount for further ad hocincreases.    There is therefore a case for introducing an element of discretion.The alternative approach (Option D) would leave the existing legislation largelyunchanged but with a discretionary power to break the index-link in any year.This might seem less alarming to pensioners.    It would cause difficulty only inyears when the power was exercised, and it would be possible to deployspecific arguments about the circumstances then prevailing.8. However, if we decided to include a benefit option in the package, Imyself doubt whether Option D would go far enough and would prefer a clearceiling modified by discretion to go beyond that.    It would then be a matter ofdebate where the ceiling should be set.    Most private sector schemes guaran-tee as little as 3 per cent to 5 per cent.    At the other extreme, 10 per cent (asenvisaged in the official report) would seem little more than window-dressing ifwe genuinely expect to reduce inflation.    There would therefore be a case for,say, 7 per cent with discretion to go above that.    Such a provision would havelittle initial effect unless it applied to benefits for past as well as for futureservices:  there could be charges that we were acting retrospectively todeprive people of accrued contractual rights;  but, as I understand the position(Annex E to the official report), we would expect to be able to rebut this.CONTRIBUTIONS9. It is also necessary to decide what would be a reasonable contributionregime.    It is relevant that most public servants pay less for their pensionsthan civil servants, although they pay by actual contributions, whereas civilservants pay through adjustment of their salaries.    There is a correspondinglystrong case for increasing the generality of contributions;  and this will bringsubstantial benefits in terms of public expenditure.    What is needed is a sys-tem of contributions which is publicly defensible, demonstrably linked to thecost of pensions increase;  and applicable on broadly similar lines to all thepublic services.10. There is no objective way of establishing a right figure, particularly ona forward-looking actuarial basis (as discussed in the report&apos;s Option A). Inmy view, action on the lines of Option B best meets the criteria in paragraph 9.Under it existing levels of contribution for basic benefits would be leftunchanged and a special charge based on the cost of public service pensionsincrease in excess of the private sector average would be levied. TheGovernment&apos;s stance should be that there should be no offset to the new chargethrough higher pay.11. On current estimates, though these need refining, the result would bethat most public servants would pay a total pension contribution of 8^ per cent(6 per cent for basic benefits and a 2j per cent special charge for pensionsincrease).     The special charge, and hence the total, would vary with variations3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL in the relative generosity of pensions increase in the public and privatesectors.    How far the uniformed services could be fitted into such arrange-ments needs further consideration.FINANCIAL EFFECTS12.        The financial effects of acting on contributions and benefits aresignificantly different.    Increasing contributions as in Option B shouldproduce savings of between  300 million and  600 million a year depending onwhat is assumed about the effect of the change on pay negotiations.    Action onbenefits, on the other hand, would have to be severe to produce anything likecomparable figures - curtailment would yield about  30 million per annum foreach percentage point of shortfall below full indexation.     These figures cannotbe added together because curtailing benefits would also have the effect ofreducing the savings generated by Option B (which are calculated to equal thedifferences in inflation-proofing between public and private sectors).THE CIVIL SERVICE13.        At present the deduction from civil servants&apos; pay rates is regarded - atleast within the Service - as meeting the cost of their better inflation-proofing.To impose in addition a &quot;special charge&quot; of Z\ per cent or so for index-linkingcould lead to an immediate demand from the Civil Service unions that pay ratesshould be increased to offset it.    In that event, the Civil Service would con-tribute no more than it does at present.    Since much of the public criticismhas focused on the Civil Service this poses a problem.    There is a strongcase for making the Z\ per cent contribution specifically deductible topreserve uniformity throughout the public services.     On the question ofwhether or to what extent we should be prepared to accept a consequentialadjustment of pay rates, at one extreme we could argue that no adjustmentshould be made on the grounds that until Megaw reports there is no agreedbasis on which future pay rates should be set;  at the other extreme is fulladjustment.    In my view, if we accepted any adjustment at all, we shouldnegotiate for less than Z\ per cent on the grounds that the Civil Service iscurrently paying too little for its pensions.MAKING THE CIVIL SERVICE SCHEME FORMALLY CONTRIBUTORY14.        Under the proposal discussed in the previous paragraph, the CivilService would be paying actual contributions of only \\ per cent for familybenefits plus the Z\ per cent special charge, a total of 4 per cent while mostof the public services would be paying %\ per cent.    This would cause wide-spread public misunderstanding, even if a significant further adjustment topay rates were being made.     More important, if a looser form of paydetermination results from the Megaw Inquiry, a fully contributory schemewill be the most effective way of ensuring - and demonstrating - that civilservants are paying a proper pension contribution.    There is therefore a casefor making the Civil Service scheme specifically contributory.    Since pensionsCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwould then be based on the grossed-up salaries they would be somewhat higherin future; by itself this would result in a &quot;windfall&quot; lor those already in thescheme - this could be avoided by splitting pensions and making service beforethe change eligible only for pensions on the old basis, whereas future servicewould qualify for the new basis;  meanwhile civil servants would be paying forthe improvement through a continuing reduction in net pay, which in the earlyyears would more than offset any additional cost.GROUPS COVERED15. The earlier decision was that changes should apply to all public sectorgroups.     Effectively, however, we can enforce a decision directly only on thepublic services and even then there are difficulties.    Short of taking newstatutory powers, we cannot compel the nationalised industries to come intoline;   and even then there would be problems.    But we would hope that we couldpersuade them to do so, as suggested in the official report;  and the tax lawmight be amended to make them, and indeed the private sector, more willingto do so in respect of any change in pension benefits.LEGISLATION16. The provisions required to give these recommendations effect cannot beincluded in the Finance Bill.    Separate legislation will be needed.    It would beshort but probably contentious.    This will create difficulties for theParliamentary timetable.CONSULTATION17. We are committed to consultation with both employers&apos; and employees&apos;organisations.    This should be on the basis of clear proposals.    When wehave agreed on these, the consultation document should be drafted urgently witha view to early publication and legislation next year.CONCLUSIONS18. My conclusions are as follows:-a. We need to decide whether it would be right and politicallysensible to take action on benefits as well as on contributions. Onbenefits, there might be full inflation-proofing up to,  say, 7 per cent,with discretion to go further.     There would be little point in this if itdid not apply to benefits for past as well as for future service.b. Whatever we decide on benefits, I recommend Option B asapplying to contributions.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. The Civil Service should pay the &quot;special charge&quot; for pensionsincrease under Option B and we should resist claims for compensationthrough higher pay; we should aim to make the scheme fully contribu-tory and consult the unions (but without commitment at this stage).d. We should bring pressure on the nationalised industries to comeinto line;  if we change the indexation of benefits, the tax law might beamended with a view to increasing this pressure on nationalisedindustries and more generally.e. We should issue as soon as possible a consultative documentcontaining our proposals.f. We should introduce legislation in 1982 to take effect in 1983-84(or sooner if practicable).G HTreasury Chambers4 December 19816CONFIDENTIAL
SUMMARY OF REPORT BY THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE ON THE VALUE OF PENSIONSIn accordance with the decisions of Ministers on 15 duly ( (81)2^11 meeting),this report examines in detail   the courses of action described in paragraph71 of the Official Committee&apos;s Progress Report.    We have, as instructed,given priority to identifying action that could be taken quickly.   The coursesexamined are as follows.(a) Course A:    an increase in employee pension contributions fromtheir typical level of 5~7% in the public services to something significantlyhigher.(b) Course B:    a partial switch to &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; contributions,under which members of index-linked schemes would pay a separate special chargedirectly related to the emerging cost of pensions increase.(c) Course C:    the imposition, in one form or another, of an upper limiton post-award increases in pensions.(d) Course D:    a discretionary power to increase pensions by less than therate of inflation.All these courses would involve primary legislation (paragraphs1-&apos;f).(ii) Misunderstanding of the present Civil Service arrangements is probablya significant factor in much public criticism of index-linking.    It would bedesirable to make the Civil Service pension scheme formally contributory. Thiscould not be done before 1 April 198^;  but that need not be a bar to earlieraction on other aspects of the report (paragraphs 5 and 6).(iii) Courses A and B would both involve changes in contribution arrangements.As presented in the report, they could produce a substantial yield from highercontributions.    This could well, however, be eroded by pay increases.    It ispossible that Course A would yield higher maximum savings than Course B; butthis possible difference should not be overstated (paragraphs 7 a&apos;:d 8).(iv)       Both courses envisage harmonisation of pension contributions betweendifferent public services.    The Civil Service at present pays a higher effectivepension contribution than most other services; it is therefore likely to appear
CONFIDENTIALto be more favourably treated.    However, other groups of public servants willbe able to claim that their pay, like that of the Civil Service, has beendepressed to take account of the value of their pension benefits.   This reinforcesthe argument that savings are likely to be at least partially eroded by payincreases (paragraph 8).(v) Course A would generally entail an increase in employee contributionsthroughout the public services to 9 or 10&apos;6 - up to h% higher than now.    It wouldbe a natural response to the Scott Report; it would reduce the present illogicaldistinction between basic benefits and pensions increase; and it would producea yield of  600 to  800 million a year (ignoring any offset through pay increases).But it would entail difficult and complicated negotiations; and, because therewould be no way of demonstrating that the contribution levels under it wereobjectively justified, it might not be a stable solution.    It would raisecomplicated technical problems over the financing of the local government andteachers schemes.    The difficulties are too great for action to be possible in1981-82 - and even in the longer term there would be serious problems (paragraphs9-20).(vi) Course B would leave most public service pension schemes undisturbedin respect of basic benefits and contributions.    It would superimpose on thema separate contribution, or charge, specifically for pensions increase. Thiswould be calculated as a percentage of the emerging cost of pensions increase;it would cover that proportion of the cost which the Government Actuary advisedwas in excess of typical private sec.     x_u.;.,iye.   ine calculations would beaveraged across all public services.    The legislation could be ready in timefor enactment in the 1981-82 Session.    This course would produce a yield ofnearly  500 million a year (ignoring any offset through pay increases); andsince it would leave existing arrangements largely undisturbed, it would beeasier than Course A to negotiate.    It would be easier to present publicly andto staff interests.    It would shift much of the financial risk of index-linkingfrom the taxpayer to the staff.   But there would be no better theoreticaljustification for the overall level of contributions than under Course A; andit would perpetuate the existing artificial distinction between basic benefitsand pensions increase (paragraphs 21-53).(vii) a variant of Course B which would avoid the artificial distinction betweenbasic benefits and pension increase could be devised.    It would involve extensiveuse of notional funding.    It would raise many negotiating problems; and we
CONFIDENTIALdoubt whether it offers the basis of a solution, even in the longer term. Itis certainly not a possibility for action in 1981-82 (paragraphs 3^-36).(viii) Under either Course A or Course B it will be necessary to consider theposition of the uniformed services (prison officers, armed forces, policeand firemen).    Members of these services receive better basic pension benefitsthan the generality of the public services, and derive more benefit frompensions increase.    There is therefore a case for requiring them to pay highercontributions than members of other services, as some do already.    The positionof the Armed Forces, however will need special consideration; and the whole rangeof issues should be considered further when Ministers have reached decisionsof principle (paragraphs 37-^2).(ix) Overseas pensioners raise special problems, but can be excluded onde minimis grounds (paragraph kj&gt;).0(x) Courses C and D would involve changes in benefits.    Course C would setan upper limit to inflation-proofing:    it is likely to be more welcome to outsidecritics of index-linking.    Course D would continue the existing presumption ofinflation-proofing, but confer on Ministers discretion to give less:    it islikely to be more flexible, and more readily accepted by staff and pensionerinterests.    There is no technical reason why the legislation required to applyeither course to the public services could not be ready in time for enactmentin the 1981-82 Session (paragraphs kh-kG).(xi)       If either Course C or Course D is to produce significant immediate savings,and satisfy the critics of index-linking, it would have to be applied to pastas well as to future service.    This would be attacked as retrospectively affectingpeople&apos;s rights, and invalidating irrevocable decisions which individuals hadtaken in the past.    For the Civil Service at least (the position of other publicservices is being urgently examined), the Attorney General has advised that thelegislation would not affect contractual rights.    However there is a risk ofa successful case against the Government under the European Convention on HumanHights.    The Government&apos;s defence could be strengthened by allowing those affectedto reopen certain past decisions.    But this is not a complete solution to thedifficulties; and its details would certainly both take time to work out andbe costly to implement.    The choice therefore seems to lie between taking the- 3 -
CONFIDENTIALrisk inherent in immediate legislation covering past as well as &apos; futureservice; confining immediate legislation to future service; and deciding againstmediate legislation and instructing officials to work out possible ways of(xii)     Course C could take various forms.    The most promising variant seemsto be full inflation-proofing up to a stated figure (say,  10%) with half orlirds protection thereafter.    The exact figures could be studied further(xiii)    Course D could also take various forms.    The most promising variant seemsto be guaranteed inflation-proofing up to a stated figure (say, 10%) with discretiorto abate thereafter.   Again, moaixnations and refinements could be studied furtherif Ministers wished to pursue this general approach (paragraphs 62-70).(xiv)     We do not recommend any &quot;mixed&quot; course, involving action on bothbenefits and contributions.    There is a case, if Ministers favoured Course Cor D,for action to align contribution levels in the public services, and ata higher rate than is now typical.    But the negotiating difficulties would besevere.    There may, however, be advantage in keeping open the possibility ofaction on benefits in order to encourage acceptance of action on contributions,(xv) We do not think it would be possible to impose Course A or Course B onthe nationalised industries (the most important part of the public sector outsidethe public services).    It would be a large incursion by Government into thesettlement of terms and conditions of service of nationalised industry workers.And the industries could always negate the essential purpose of the two courses -to make staff pay more for existing benefits - by improving other pension benefit;or conceding pay increases (paragraphs 77-80).(xvi) There is a better prospect of applying Course C or Course D to thenationalised industries:    these courses would, in fact, apply automaticallyto many schemes, since these provide inflation-proofing through a link with thepublic service pension increase system.    However, there are some importantexceptions; and there would be nothing to prevent schemes from creating a directlink with the retail price index (RPI), which some already have (paragraphs81 and 82).- k -
confidential(xvii)    Direct legislation to require existing links with the RPI to be brokenwould expose the Government to the risk of a successful action under theEuropean Convention on Human Rights.    Nor would it be satisfactory to makewithdrawal of index-linking a condition of Government financial assistance tonationalised industries (paragraphs 83 and 8^).(xviii) An alternative would be to operate through the tax system, so as towithdraw Inland Revenue approval from schemes which permitted pensions increaseto exceed what was provided by public service schemes.    This would affect theprivate sector, which would be likely to protest.    But there are good argumentsin principle in favour of a limitation on these lines if Ministers favoured CourseC or D for the public services.    Legislation would not be possible before 1983(though it could then be contained in a Finance Bill); and a transitional periodof several years would be required in which schemes could amend their rules(paragraphs 85-9^) (xix) It is therefore not possible to ensure the application of Course A orB directly to the nationalised industries.    If Ministers wished to apply CourseC or 1), the choice lies between use of the tax system; and relying on theexisting links with the public service pensions increase code and the assuranceof best endeavours offered by the Nationalised Industries&apos; Chairmen&apos;s Group.The recently instituted arrangements for monitoring nationalised industry pensionschemes would provide a mechanism for maintaining pressure bn the industriesto make any necessary changes.(xx) We do not offer Ministers a recommended course of action.    Our conclusionis that, in pension terms, there is a good case for harmonising contributionsbetween different public services, and at a higher level than the generalityof public services now pay.    We regard Course B as the more practical way ofachieving this result.    Like Course A it offers    the prospect of substantialinitial savings; as with Course A these could be eroded by pay increases; butthe prospects of minimising this are better under Course B.    The argumentsrelevant to Courses C and D involve a more political choice.    Any savings underCourse C - and any variant of Course D which seemed likely to curtail benefitsseverely - could immediately be more than offset by higher pay or lower pensioncontributions.   Both courses would raise the problem of retrospection if appliedto past service.    No approach to the problem of the wider public sector is freefrom difficulty:    we think that Ministers&apos; decisions on the public services- 5
CONFIDENTIALshould be taken on their own merits and not be determined by the positionregarding the nationalised industries (paragraphs 97-lOk).(xxi)     It will be essential to begin consultations with the interestsaffected as soon as possible.    These would be best conducted on the basis ofa published document setting out the Government&apos;s views (paragraph 109).- 6 -
y CONFIDENTIALOFFICIAL COMMITTEE ON THE VALUE OF PENSIONS: SECOND REPORT1. At its meeting on 15 July, E Committee invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe then Lord President of the Council to arrange for us to submit a further report by theend of September, examining in more detail the courses of action described in paragraph 71of our progress report. We were instructed to give priority to identifying action that couldbe taken quickly.2. This report accordingly:i. examines in detail the courses of action described in paragraph 71 of our progressreport, as they might apply in the public services, with particular reference tothe legislative and other action which each of them would require and the timescale on which it seems realistic to expect such action;ii. discusses the position of index-linked pension schemes in the public sectoroutside the public services, and the ways in which any decisions regarding publicservice schemes might be applied more widely;iii. suggests how Ministers&apos; decisions could best be presented to interested partiesand the general public.3. It would overburden this report to repeat at length the material in our progress report.For convenience, however, we attach at Annex A summary details of the main public sectorpension schemes (previously circulated as Annex B to our progress report), and a glossary ofthe main technical terms used in our report.THE COURSES OF ACTION4. The courses to be examined in this report are as follows.Course A:  an increase in employee pension contributions from their typical level of5-7 per cent in the public services to something significantly higher.Course B:   a partial switch to &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot;  (PAYG) contributions, under whichmembers of index-linked schemes would pay a separate special charge directly relatedto the emerging cost of pensions increase.Course C: the imposition, in one form or another, of an upper limit on post-awardincreases in pensions.Course D: a discretionary power to increase pensions by less than the rate of inflation,All these courses would involve primary legislation.
CONFIDENTIALAnnex B summarises the effects of each course on the main public service schemes. Ourinitial discussion is confined to the public services. Paragraphs 77 to 96 below consider thewider public sector.A contributory Civil Service scheme5. Experience in the Civil Service suggests - and Scott pointed out - that levyingcontributions by adjusting the level of gross salary is not well understood; and itpresupposes, among other things, an agreed method of determining gross pay, from which adeduction is then made. Misunderstanding of the present Civil Service arrangements - abelief that civil servants &quot;pay nothing for their pensions&quot; - is probably at the root of much ofthe criticism of index-linking. Whatever approach Ministers may decide to adopt to thegeneral question of index-linking, we think the process would be clearer - and public opinionreassured -if a contribution were simply levied from gross pay and the scheme madeexplicitly contributory.6. The implications of making the Civil Service scheme contributory are discussed inAnnex C. In brief, there could be problems of presentation in the raising of gross pay levelsit would entail - though a good deal would depend on the vigour and coherence with whichthe case was put. A lot would also depend on the actual figures used for the adjustment. Onpresent thinking there would be a small (about 1 per cent) reduction in net pay, reflectingthe fact that pensions would in future be based on a higher rate of pay. But becauseadministrative complications would in any case preclude making the change before1 April 1984 it would be possible simply to announce acceptance of the principle of thechange now, leaving precise figures for settlement nearer the time, following the necessarydiscussions with staff interests. We have no reason to think this would give rise to difficultyin the context of the Megaw Inquiry.I - CONTRIBUTION OPTIONS7. Although Courses A and B are conceptually different, and would raise very differentnegotiating and technical problems, they both set out to achieve an increase in thecontribution from employees for the present level of benefits. They present a number ofcommon features which we draw to the attention of Ministers.a. It is possible to attach figures to the yield from higher contributions. Whetherthat results in a net saving will depend on the extent to which higher pensioncontributions are offset by higher pay. In the extreme case of the Armed Forces,the size of whose total remuneration package is largely determined by a formalprocess of comparability, changes in contribution arrangements are likely to havenegligible effects on total expenditure. The position for other services is lesscertain.
CONFIDENTIALb. Although there are important differences in the underlying rationales ofCourses A and B the contribution levels that could be justified under them neednot be very different. This report suggests a level of 9 or 10 per cent underCourse A; but a lower rate would also be possible. Course B implies a level of8i per cent; but a slightly higher rate might be justified (see paragraph 27below). Not too much should be made of apparent differences in the financialeffects of the two courses.Implications for pay negotiations8. Courses A and B both concentrate on pension aspects and leave any adjustment in totalremuneration which may be thought appropriate to be handled as a separate pay matter.The long-term effects on pay of an increase in pension contributions are hard to predict.Even in the short term, the effects will depend on the nature of future pay arrangements(the eventual Megaw recommendations will clearly have important implications for the CivilService), on Government policy for pay in the public services, and on relative negotiatingstrengths. However, we must draw the attention of Ministers to the following points.a. Because civil servants are currently making a higher effective pensioncontribution than most other groups of public servants, the general harmonisationof pension contribution required by either course will appear to bear less heavilyon them than on others. (Course B, indeed, would imply, on current figures,noincrease in Civil Service contributions beyond those implied in the 1980 payresearch settlement). This is unavoidable under any course involving changes incontributions affecting the whole of the public services: to attempt to applyeither course differently to different public service schemes, for examplebecause of the past history of pay negotiations, would be quite impractical.b. However, other groups of public servants - notably the Armed Forces, teachersand certain NHS groups - will also be able to claim that their existing levels ofpay take appropriate account of the value of index-linking because these havebeen determined by a formal comparability exercise in the recent past, underwhich specific adjustments were made in respect of pension benefits (seeAnnex A).It is clear that these facts will make both for presentational difficulties and for difficult paynegotiations.COURSE A: STRAIGHT INCREASE IN CONTRIBUTIONS9. Under this option, the pensions increase legislation would remain unchanged, butscheme members would be required to pay higher contributions based on an estimate ofaccruing costs.   These contributions would not be divided between contributions for basic
CONFIDENTIALbenefits and contributions for pensions increase.10. A general increase in contributions would be a natural response to the Scott Report.Events since our progress report, in particular the fact that index-linked gilts are stillyielding over 2} per cent in the (restricted) market in which they are available, mean thateven within the context of the old Civil Service pay research arrangements it would havebeen difficult to justify on actuarial grounds a contribution of more than about 9 per cent.11. As we also pointed out in our progress report, it would be possible to adduce otherarguments in support of a contribution rate of 10 per cent; but these would be of a fairlypragmatic kind. They are mainly the value of the implicit guarantee of full protectionagainst inflation; and the fact that pensions comparability exercises have not taken fullaccount of some features of private sector practice.12. It would then be reasonable to bring contributions for non-manual staff in other publicservices (other than the &quot;uniformed services&quot;*) into line with the Civil Service from theirtypical current level of 6 per cent. The argument would be that since benefits in the variousschemes were broadly equivalent, so should the contributions be.13. The negotiating difficulties would be formidable. Even within the context of the oldCivil Service pay arrangements the arguments in favour of an increase by more than abouti per cent would not be decisive. Other groups of public servants would argue strongly thatthere is no generally accepted relationship between pension benefits  and employeecontributions; that pay and pensions must be considered together; and that their pay hadhistorically been negotiated in the light of their actual pension contribution. Hence anyincrease in pension contributions should be offset by an increase in pay.14. A general increase in employee contributions to 10 per cent could yield approaching 800 million a year; an increase to 9 per cent would yield nearly  600 million. However, forthe reasons outlined above, the unions would be under pressure from their members torecover the resulting worsening in conditions, particularly where it can be claimed thatcurrent pay levels reflect a specific adjustment on account of pensions; and in servicesoutside direct Government control it is possible that the employers would themselvessympathise with the unions&apos; case. It is improbable therefore that this saving could be fullymaintained.Technical aspects15. For public service schemes, with some exceptions, the Government could impose anincrease in contributions without primary legislation, though it would be necessary to consult*The &quot;uniformed services&quot; (prison officers, armed forces, police and firemen) need specialconsideration. They are discussed in paragraphs 37 to 42 below.
CONFIDENTIALrepresentatives of both staff and employers beforehand. There would, however, besignificant technical problems over the financing of some schemes, discussed inparagraph 17. Primary legislation would be needed to make the amendments referred to inparagraph 16 below.16. The main exceptions involving primary legislation are as follows.a. Local Government and other local servicesSchedule 3 to the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 provides that the cost of pensionsincrease to former local government employees shall be met by the employers.The same provision applies to the former employees of a wide range of otherlocal services, including firemen, courts&apos; staffs, civilian employees of policeauthorities, traffic wardens, probation service staff and certain teachers possiblyreceiving local authority pensions. It would be necessary to amend the Scheduleto provide for employees to meet part of the cost of pensions increaseb. NHS and teachersA similar point arises on these schemes. Schedule 3 to the Superannuation Act1972 provides that contributions must be related to benefits under the schemes(which exclude pensions increase); this affects local government as well. Ahigher contribution would almost certainly have to be presented in terms ofpensions increase, so that amending regulations to increase contributions couldbe ultra vires without primary legislation to amend the Schedule.c. Parliamentary PensionsThe present contribution rates (6 per cent for MPs, 5 per Gent for Ministers) arelaid down by primary legislation. As the Government probably would not wish toput a specific new contribution rate in legislation presented to Parliament beforeit had concluded its consultations with staff interests in the public services (sincethat would imply that it had entered the consultations with a closed mind), thebest course would probably be to take power to set the contribution rates eitherby statutory instrument or, more likely, by resolution of the House of Commons.(This might also be an opportunity to put the Parliamentary pension scheme intosecondary legislation as a whole).Financing of schemes17. If employee contributions were raised it would be necessary to decide what to do withthe resulting increase in contribution income. There would be problems in two schemes.a. Local government pensions are financed by a mixture of actual funds (from whichbasic benefits are paid) and PAYG charges by employers on the rate fund tofinance pensions increase. It would be illogical to pay into the funds an increase
CONFIDENTIALin employee contributions designed explicitly to take account of the cost ofpensions increase (unless the funds were also to take on the cost of pensionsincrease). But if it were paid over to the employers, it would tend to be regardedas a PAYG contribution in all but name. There is no necessary relation betweenit and the PAYG cost of pensions increase: in 1980-81, for example, the cost ofindex-linking local authority pensions was less than 4 per cent of totalpensionable pay, so that an increase of 4 per cent in employee contributions, asdiscussed above, would mean that employees were more than meeting theemerging cost of pensions increase.An alternative course would be to abolish the existing funds and move to asystem of notional funding or to pure PAYG. This has been under considerationfor some time, and may perhaps be a possibility for the future, but is not astarter for action in 1981-82.The teachers&apos; scheme is notionally funded. Contributions from employees andemployers are deemed to be paid into a fund, and the level of employers&apos;contribution is assessed by reference to the notional state of the fund. But thecost of pensions increase is not charged to the fund: instead it is borne by theExchequer. (This means that the Exchequer subsidises the employers -mainlylocal education authorities.) It would be possible for the Exchequer simply toappropriate the increase in employee contributions; but this would raise similarproblems to those discussed in a. above; and there would be complaints fromemployers to the effect that the notional fund was being unfairly deprived ofincome and that they would have to pay higher contributions in consequence.More logically, it would be possible to charge pensions increase to the fund, towhich the extra contributions would be credited; but again, this would requirecomplicated negotiations between Government and employers, whosecontributions would stand to be increased.18. Essentially, there are two approaches to these problems. One would be to divide thenew level of contribution between basic benefits and pensions increase. This would runcontrary to the logic of Course A: it is more in keeping with Course B. The other approachis to recast the financial arrangements of the local government and teachers&apos; schemes.While this has attractions on general grounds, it would broaden the discussion considerably,and would not be feasible for legislation in 1981-82.Course A: Summary Assessment19. The advantages of Course A are:(a) It is a natural response to the Scott Report.(b) It would reduce the extent of the present illogical distinction between basic
CONFIDENTIALbenefits and pensions increase,(c)     The potential saving in public expenditure.ZO.    The disadvantages are:(a) Since the increases in contributions would represent an important change in theconstruction of pension schemes and have implications for the way in which theyare financed, there would need to be negotiation both about the contributionsthemselves (controversial especially with employees) and their allocation(controversial especially with employers). Even if this did not affect theoutcome, changes could not be negotiated in time for legislation in 1981-82.(b) There is no objective way of justifying an employees&apos; contribution rate as high as10 per cent; a figure of 9 per cent would be more easily justified, but in thatcase the potential savings would be correspondingly less.(c) If implemented, there would be a danger of savings leaking back into higher basicpay.COURSE B: PARTIAL SWITCH TO PAYG CONTRIBUTIONS21. Under this course, there would be two tiers of employee contributions: one, based onaccruing cost, towards basic pensions benefits; and a second, based on emerging cost,towards the cost of pensions increase.22. The fact that basic pensions and pension increases are the subject of separatelegislation and are sometimes paid by different authorities can be regarded as anomalous.Nevertheless, this separation is at present the pattern; the proposal under Course B acceptsthe pattern, and can therefore be implemented with less disturbance to existing schemes andless need for negotiation than Course A.23. The present division of financial responsibility in the local government and teachersschemes effectively assumes that employees contribute nothing to the cost of pensionsincrease. One can, therefore, devise an approach which takes the present level of employeecontribution (6 per cent in most schemes) for granted as a contribution towards basicpensions (which are similar for all services except prison officers, Armed Forces, police andfiremen), and grafts on top of that a special charge towards the cost of pensions increase.24. Again, building on the present arrangements, and seeking maximum clarity, the newcharge could be related to (ie be a share of) the actual emerging cost of pensions increase,which has the advantage of being unambiguously knowable.
CONFIDENTIAL25. It would not, however, be appropriate to use emerging cost as the criterion inindividual schemes - averaging would be necessary. This is mainly because, with thedifferent degrees to which pension schemes are &quot;mature&quot; (and provide for a normalproportion of pensioners with full pensions), the cost of pensions increase as a proportion ofpensionable pay varies from, for instance, 6 per cent in the Civil Service to under 3 per centin the NHS. (The figure for the NHS will tend to increase as the scheme becomes moremature.) Averaging would have the additional advantage of reducing the fluctuations overtime inherent in a pay-as-you-go approach as a result of variations in the ratio of active toretired staff. No doubt staff in services in which the emerging cost of pensions increase wasbelow the average would complain; but the answer would be that the pensions increasesystem applied alike to all public servants (subject to the point discussed in paragraphs 37 to42 below), and it was reasonable that all should pay the same contribution.26. What proportion of the emerging cost of pensions increase should be covered bysupplementary contributions? Overall, public service pensions increases cost rather lessthan 5 per cent of the public service pay bill. Private sector employers used as analogues inthe 1980 pay research evidence gave post-award pensions increases providing about 50 percent protection against inflation. If the other 50 per cent of protection from which thepublic services benefit were to be charged entirely to employees, this would imply that therate of supplementary contribution should be 2J per cent of pensionable pay. This figurewould vary slowly over time, as public service pension schemes mature, with changes in thelevel of inflation, and with the practice of private sector pension schemes; and it wouldtend to be reduced, other things being equal, as guaranteed minimum pension entitlementsunder the State scheme built up, since the State scheme provides pension increase on thisentitlement.27. Further study may need to be given to the analogy with the private sector. On the onehand, the analogues used for the pay research evidence tend to be drawn from employerswho are likely to give more generous pensions increase than the private sector average. Onthe other, private sector pensions are typically based on 60 ths of final salary rather than80 ths plus lump sum, as in the public services; and this increases the relative cost.Implementation28. Legislation would be needed to provide the Minister for the Civil Service with power toprescribe a special charge related to the aggregate emerging cost of pensions increases, tobe paid by members of public service pension schemes; the proportion of cost to be coveredby the special charge would be variable from time to time in the light of advice from theGovernment Actuary based on surveys of private sector practice. The legislation wouldprovide that the special charge should be appropriated by the authorities responsible forfinancing  the pensions  (thus obviating the problems discussed in paragraph 17). The
CONFIDENTIALlegislative changes outlined in paragraph 16(a) and (c) above would also need to be made.29. In the case of the Civil Service there is in effect a combined contribution already forboth basic benefits and pensions increase. This would be increased under Course A.Course B would require the contribution towards basic benefits to be brought back into linewith the contributions of local government workers, teachers and NHS staff, ie 6 per cent;the 1980 Pay Research data indicated that an appropriate contribution for basic benefitswould have been 5.8 per cent. A 2$ per cent special charge on top would make the totalCivil Service contribution 8i per cent, broadly the same as would be charged on the existingbasis if the Civil Service scheme were contributory. If the special charge were levied beforethe Civil Service scheme became formally contributory (paragraph 6) it would be necessaryto make a separate reduction in pay for basic benefits. This would be untidy, but could bedefended as an interim measure.30. Manual workers in local government and the NHS at present pay a 5 per centcontribution towards basic benefits. A differential of 1 per cent or so between manual andnon-manual workers has been regarded as appropriate because the greater career progressionof non-manual workers makes their benefits, as related to salary, more expensive. Manualworkers&apos; basic contributions might therefore remain at 5 per cent, with the 2i per centcharge on top. While it would seem natural to apply the same rate of 5 per cent to theindustrial Civil Service, this would, on the basis of the comparability data used in 1980,amount to giving them a pay increase of 2.9 per cent; some additional adjustment to paywould probably be necessary to maintain the former equivalence of total remuneration withthat of the outside analogues.31. The gross yield from this course might be of the order of nearly  500 million a year.As with Course A (see paragraph 14 above), there would be some immediate offset throughpay adjustments; and even the remaining savings could in time be eroded by pay increases,though there is perhaps a better prospect that savings from a separate charge, related to aclearly identified benefit, and subject to variation in the light of future assessments ofprivate sector practice, would last longer than those from an undifferentiated increase inpension contributions to a level well out of line with private sector practice.Course B; Summary Assessment32. The advantages of Course B are as follows:(a) Pensions increase has traditionally been provided for by special legislation, andsometimes financed by authorities separate from those who pay basic pensions;Course B would be a further adjustment within this basic pattern and thereforerelatively straightforward to present and implement.(b) Benefits and contributions under individual public service schemes would not be
CONFIDENTIALaffected, and there would therefore be no need for negotiations about them. Thespecial charge for pensions increase would be regarded as part of the pensionsincrease system, on which it has never been the practice to negotiate; and anyconsultations could be handled as a general matter.(c) It would shift a large part of the financial risk of index-linking (high expendituredue to inflation, and not matched by private sector practice) from the taxpayeror ratepayer to the staff.(d) The savings it would produce, though initially smaller than under Course A, wouldbe more likely to last.33. The disadvantages are:(a) There is no actuarial basis for the resulting level of contributions (this criticismis bound to apply to some degree to any scheme in the absence of a formalcomparability arrangement).(b) Some public services may object to paying a charge for pensions increase relatedto the average.(c) It would be difficult presentationally to exempt from the new charge any servicewhich retained a non-contributory pension scheme (as the Armed Forces wellmay); but a pensions contribution which was partly explicit (the charge forpensions increase) and partly a reduction in gross pay could be confusing.(d) It preserves the existing artificial distinction between basic benefits and pensionsincrease.A Possible Variant: notional funding34. The main objection to Course B is that it would combine two very different approachesto the assessment of pension contributions (paragraph 33d above). This would tend toperpetuate the existing illogicalities in the financing of, particularly, the local governmentand teachers schemes (though it would also make it easier to take earlier action regardingthose schemes). The variant described in paragraph 43 of our progress report (under whichnotional funds would be set up and employee contributions would be adjusted to take accountof the past non-fulfillment of actuarial assumptions) would avoid this awkwardness; and wehave considered it further.35. A fuller note of the proposal and the arguments relating to it is at Annex D. Jr,practical terms, the complexities would be considerable. This is because an extension ofnotional funding would be involved, as a basis for determining employee rather thanemployer contributions; this would be a novel principle in pension practice, public orprivate.   The required changes in pension schemes would be substantial and contentious;
CONFIDENTIALmuch negotiation would be involved, and probably detailed legislation. Quickimplementation would not be possible. There would be additional costs in running thesystem.36. Apart from these administrative considerations, the Committee thought it doubtfulwhether such an approach, even if implemented, would fully achieve its object. It isquestionable whether a notional fund for each scheme (and especially two notional funds ifthis proved necessary - see Annex D) would provide a sufficiently authoritative basis forrequiring contributions from employees or for persuading the public that adequatecontributions had been paid. It is an interesting and potentially useful concept and is theonly way by which the adequacy of past contributions can be checked and adjustments made;but, in the light of their consideration, the Committee regard Course B as a more practical,if cruder, means of tying back to employees a substantial share of any unanticipatedincrease in the (money) cost of pensions. In any event, we are clear that the variant is not apossibility for action in the 1981-82 Session.THE UNIFORMED SERVICES37. It is necessary under any contribution option to consider the position of the uniformedservices (prison officers, Armed Forces, police and fire).38. Members of all these services enjoy better basic benefits (lower retiring age and fasteraccrual of pension) but these are partly in compensation for early termination of career.They also derive more benefit from pensions increase, since this is payable from age 55, and,in the case of police and fire, on a pension based on 60ths of final salary. In recognition ofthis fact they mostly pay higher contributions than the public services in general. TheArmed Forces pay 11 per cent through a reduction in gross pay; the police and fire servicecontribute directly 7 per cent and 6| per cent respectively. But prison officers in effect paythe same as other non-industrial civil servants, on whom their pay is based.39. The Armed Forces are in a special position, with a career pattern of variable lengthunlike any other public service. On average only 16 per cent serve long enough to receive animmediate pension; and of these the majority are obliged to leave before they can earn afull pension. Moreover, some 15,000 servicemen a year leave with less than 5 years&apos; service.The Armed Forces pay for their benefits by adjustment of their pay, taking all those factorsinto account. Last April, on the basis of a study by the Government Actuary, theGovernment agreed to a recommendation by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body that thereshould be an increase to 11 per cent in the indirect contribution paid by the Armed Forcesfor their pension benefits including index linking. Although this recommendation explicitlytook no account of the Scott Report, it might still be difficult to justify a further increaseas proposed in Course A;  and any such increase would, no doubt, be taken immediately into
CONFIDENTIALaccount in the annual earnings comparison exercise on which Armed Forces pay is stillbased. While in principle Course B could be applied to the Armed Forces, it would be asubstantial change in the approach adopted by the Review Body, to replace one element in acomprehensive comparability exercise by one differently and separately calculated. It is notimpossible that the total contribution from the Armed Forces would be reduced (a fall of1 per cent would be worth about  22\ million at current pay rates).40. There might, therefore, be no public expenditure saving, and perhaps extra cost, aswell as suspicion generated within the Armed Forces themselves, from imposing either ofthe contribution options on the formal system of comparability by which Armed Forces payis at present determined. On the other hand it would be presentationally difficult to appearto exempt one public service scheme from the treatment being applied to others. While theArmed Forces have so far not been criticised in this area, it is possible that much of thecriticism and misunderstanding currently directed against the Civil Service (paragraph 5above) could be transferred to them. The issue will need to be considered further ifMinisters favour a contribution option.41. For the other uniformed services an explicit contribution rate would certainly have tobe set. An essential step in the logic of Course A is that similar contributions should be paidfor similar benefits. Hence, as now, better benefits should entail higher contributions.Prison officers and members of the police and fire services should therefore pay acontribution in excess of the standard 9 or 10 per cent under this course.42. Under Course B, police and fire contributions could be left untouched; but prisonofficers should pay more than the basic 6 per cent envisaged for the rest of the CivilService. Subject to the points in paragraphs 39 and 40 above, there would be a good case forlevying the charge in respect of pensions increase at a higher rate for all uniformed servicesthan the public service average since members of those services derive significantly greaterbenefits from it. If the higher rate were, say, 3 I per cent (instead of 2i percent) - and thisis less than could be justified on grounds of comparative cost - the police would be paying atotal contribution of 10\ per cent, which would not be far out of line with the effectivecontribution in the Armed Forces. There are, however, other considerations; prisonofficers, in particular, who have only suspended their recent industrial action, could beexpected to oppose any suggestion that they should be treated differently from other civilservants. These issues would need further detailed investigation if Ministers favoured acontribution option.OVERSEAS PENSIONS43. Most of the overseas officers entitled to pensions increases from UK funds under thepension increase legislation have retired.   For the minimal numbers still in service and
CONFIDENTIALemployed by overseas governments, on terms which require no contribution for the UKpensions increase expectation, Courses A and B could not be enforced without concurrentoverseas legislation, which could not easily be obtained. But under either course, the verysmall consequential expenditure on UK pensions increase would justify excluding thesepotential pensioners from any contribution obligations.II      BENEFIT OPTIONS44. Courses C and D would involve limitations (or the possibility of limitations) onbenefits. Subject to the very important point discussed in paragraphs 47 to 56 below, neitherwould present technical difficulty. For the public services, all that would be required isfairly straightforward amendments to the pensions increase legislation (mainly section 59 ofthe Social Security Pensions Act 1975).45. Although it would be necessary to consult quite a wide variety of interests, therewould be no need for negotiations as such. This does not mean that all would bestraightforward: there would be many protests and representations to be dealt with, andcontinuing pressure from staff interests for compensation, whether in the form of lowerpension contributions or higher pay. What it does mean is that either benefit option couldundoubtedly be the subject of legislation in 1981-82, if a place could be found in thelegislative programme.46. The two options could take a number of different forms, discussed below; but theessential difference between them is that Course C sets an upper limit to inflation-proofingbeyond which Ministers may not go without new primary legislation, whereas Course Dcontinues the existing presumption of inflation-proofing but confers on Ministers discretionto give less. This difference has the following general implications for any choice betweenthe two courses.a. Course C will be more welcome to the critics of index-linking, Course D tocurrent and prospective beneficiaries.b. Course C, because of its inflexibility, gives Ministers more protection againstconflicting pressures in the operation of the system; by the same token, if itproduces results which Ministers think inappropriate, they cannot readily becorrected.c. It cannot be predicted in advance which Course would produce greater savings(this would depend on the design of the system, the pattern of inflation and theexercise of Ministerial discretion); but, in situations where the automaticCourse C was strongly restrictive, there would be difficult-to-resist demands forlower contributions or higher pay or discretionary topping-up of benefits.
CONFIDENTIALd.      Course D  is likely to raise fewer difficulties of retrospection (paragraphs 47to 56 below).The force of these general arguments will naturally vary with the precise nature of thepreferred version of each course.Problems of Retrospection and Reserved Rights47. Courses C and D would not produce significant savings for many years, or satisfypublic critics of inflation-proofing, unless they were applied to pensions already in paymentand to the whole of pensions awarded in future (ie to pensions in respect of service beforethe date of the change in the pensions increase system, and not only to pensions in respect ofservice after that date).48. Legislation to this effect could be attacked as retrospective; and we have accordinglyobtained the views of the Attorney General. These are set out in the letter of 24 Septemberfrom his office, reproduced at Annex E.49- This concludes that, at least in the case of civil servants, there is no legal right topensions increase. Pensions increases are governed by statutory provisions which may bechanged without giving rise to any claim in contract.50. It could, however, be argued that civil servants and pensioners have a moral right tocontinued inflation-proofing of benefits. This argument would be clearest in the case ofstaff who have transferred service to the Civil Service scheme from previous pensionableemployment, or who have bought added years. Such staff have paid a price for a definedbenefit; and it could well be argued that to reduce the value of the benefit wasretrospectively to change the terms of a bargain. An aggrieved civil servant or pensionermight take action under the European Convention of Human Rights. The Government wouldhave a defence; and the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty; but there is a risk thatthe Court would find against the Government.51. The Attorney General has advised that the Government&apos;s defence would bestrengthened if it were prepared to offer those who had transferred in service or boughtadded years either compensation or an option to reopen the agreement into which they hadentered where additional index-linked benefits have been acquired at an agreed price ofexchange. Examples are additional contributions for higher widows&apos; benefits and the partialallocation of pensions to provide or increase the pension of a dependant. We do not thinkthat the offer of compensation would be an entirely satisfactory solution.(a) The categories of staff just mentioned are not always clearly distinguishablefrom other categories. Moreover, the practical effect would be different fortransfers   from   schemes   participating   on   the   transfer   club   (where the
CONFIDENTIALarrangements are essentially year-for-year reckoning) on the one hand andprivate sector schemes on the other. The argument is much weaker in theformer case, where the position of staff would be little different if they hadserved wholly in the Civil Service,(b) Since a precise deduction has for many years been made from Civil Service payrates to take account of the inflation-proofing of pension benefits, it will beargued that reckonable service earned in the ordinary way is just as much part ofa specific bargain as reckonable service gained by purchase.52. It is more likely that a solution could be devised by allowing pensioners and schememembers to reopen past decisions, such as a decision to buy in added years. But this coulditself create problems; and most of the difficulties outlined in paragraph 51 above wouldremain. It would be impossible to solve them in time for legislation in 1981-82; and, even ifthey could eventually be solved, the solutions would be certain to entail a formidableadministrative cost.53. What is said in paragraphs 49-52 above applies only to the Civil Service. It is likely tohold good for the other public services as well; but it is possible that members of someservices (and nationalised industry schemes) have a contractual right to inflation-proofing.If so, the chances of the Government losing a case under the European Convention of HumanRights would be much higher. Departments are discussing the position urgently with theirlegal advisers.54. If Ministers concluded that full inflation-proofing could not be removed from pensionentitlements earned in the past, all existing pensioners would continue to receive it, andthose retiring within a few years of the change would continue to have most of their pensionfully inflation-proofed. The financial savings in the first few years would therefore benegligible; and it might be 20 years or so before significant inroads were made into pensioncosts. There could also be considerable administrative complicatons. In thesecircumstances, it is open to doubt whether it would be worth pursuing Course C or Course D.55. There is no compromise or half-way house in which to avoid the difficulties. Forinstance, leaving existing pensioners with full inflation-proofing, but not guaranteeing it onthe pensions of those yet to retire would be of doubtful equity, and would lead to manyanomalies. The only possible way of reducing the difficulties would be on the lines indicatedin paragraph 52 above; and, as that paragraph makes clear, even if a solution could bedevised, it would take time and be expensive to put into effect.56. If Ministers favour Course C or D in principle, the choice seems to lie between:(a)     immediate legislation in respect of all service, with a risk of losing a case underthe European Convention of Human Rights;
CONFIDENTIAL(b) immediate legislation in respect of future service only, although this will meanthat no significant inroads into the cost of pensions increase can be made forperhaps 20 years;(c) deciding against immediate legislation, and instructing officials to considerpossible ways of reducing the difficulties outlined in paragraph 51 above.COURSE C: A CUT-OFF POINT57. The imposition of a cut-off point could take one of various different forms. The maintypes are as follows.(i) A fixed percentage figure, say 10 per cent58. Full inflation proofing would be given in any year in which the rate of inflation wasless than the cut-off point; protection would be given up to but not beyond the chosen figureif inflation exceeded that figure in any year. For each percentage point by which inflationexceeded 10 per cent in November 1982, the full-year saving for the public services would be 28 million; the saving in 1982-83 would be around  10 million*. This variant would have theadvantage of being apparently based on those private sector schemes which provide forautomatic stated increases, typically 3 or 5 per cent, provided they do not exceed the rateof inflation; but the similarity would be more superficial than genuine since most privatesector schemes have discretion, normally exercised to a considerable extent, to providehigher increases. The change would limit the cost of pensions increase. The drawbacksseem to be:a. it would be a clear worsening of existing terms of service, and so be certain tolead to pressure for compensation - eg through reductions in pensioncontributions - and raise the problem of retrospection in an acute form;b. it would be difficult to choose and defend a figure; any figure could be renderedinappropriate by circumstances which could not be predicted in advance.c. if inflation exceeded the cut-off figure for any length of time, there would bestrong pressure for further ad hoc pensions increase.(ii) Pensions increase of a fixed proportion (say two thirds or four fifths) of the annual rateof inflation59. This would automatically create, even when inflation was low, a permanent andgrowing erosion of the real value of pension benefits. This would be hard to defend on anyground of principle, and would not be in line with private sector practice. If inflation ran athigh rates for very long, the reduction in the real value of benefits would quickly becomeserious; again this would lead to pressure for ad hoc additional increases.   If inflation were?These figures are discussed more fully in Annex B. The discussion there is also relevant toparagraphs 59, 60, 67, 68, 69 and 70.
CONFIDENTIAL10 per cent in November 1982, the saving would be  20-30 million in 1982-83,  60-90 millionin a full year.(iii)    Full inflation-proofing up to a stated figure (say 10 per cent) with half or two thirdsprotection thereafter60. This, effectively a combination of (i) and (ii), would link their advantages, but noteliminate their disadvantages. It would provide full protection when inflation was low, butkeep increases down when inflation was high and public disquiet about inflation-proofingcould be expected to be greatest. There would be a good chance of avoiding ad hocsupplementation unless inflation continued at a high level for quite a long period. But thesystem would be rigid and there would be no means of predicting in advance how it wouldcompare with private sector practice. The saving would be up to  5 million in 1982-83, 15 million in a full year, for each percentage point by which inflation exceeded 10 per centin November 1982.61. If Course C were felt to be attractive, we would regard the approach at (iii) above asbeing defensible in more situations than either (i) or (ii). If Ministers wished to pursue itfurther, more work could be done on the relevant figures (the level up to which fullprotection would be given and the degree of protection thereafter).COURSE D: POWER TO INCREASE PENSIONS BY LESS THAN INFLATION62. Under this course, the presumption would be that full inflation-proofing would be givenunless, in any particular year, Ministers chose to give less.Parliamentary procedure63. On this basis, it would be consistent with normal practice for any Order in line withthe statutory presumption (ie full inflation-proofing) to be subject to negative resolution,whereas any involving use of the exceptional power would be subject to affirmativeresolution.Use of the power64. If Ministers decided to take a relatively open-ended power of this sort, they would heexpected to give an indication of how they intended to use it. They might say, for example,that it might sometimes be necessary to abate pensions increases to match public servicepay increases when these were held below the rate of inflation. However, there could becomplications if the pay of different public services were being treated in significantlydifferent ways.
CONFIDENTIAL65. Alternatively, it might be indicated that pensions increases would be abated incircumstances where output or earnings in the economy as a whole were declining in realterms. This would be a more stringent condition, so that the power would be exercised lessfrequently than under the approach outlined in the previous paragraph. It would be readilydefensible at the time in terms of equity between different groups in the economy; but therewould also be arguments that the power should be used symmetrically to allow for catchingup when, after a period of constraint, real incomes were rising.66. Against this background, a number of different approaches would be feasible.(i) Unlimited discretion to abate increases67. This would leave pensioners and staff interests uncertain of their position and wouldmake it harder to maintain contribution levels. It would stir up the controversy about thewhole principle of index-linking in an acute form. It might not be easy to square with thesort of approach outlined in paragraphs 64 and 65 above.   The scope for savings is large -the1981 increase will cost  23Z million in a full year - but it is most unlikely that substantialde-indexation could be maintained very long without pressure for ad hoc increases orreduced employee contributions.(ii) Power to abate by up to, say, 5 percentage points68. This would limit the amount of real income which pensioners could lose in a singleyear, and in practice a decline in the real value of pensions by 5 per cent in any one yearmight be as much as Ministers would wish to contemplate. But it could still be representedas unfair and give rise to hostility on the part of staff and pensioners, since it could be usedto procure regular reductions in real income even when inflation was low and when privatepensions were being more fully protected. Full use of such a power at the 1982 upratingwould yield  140 million in a full year, and approaching  50 million in 1982-83.(iii) Power to abate by up to a stated proportion (say, one third or one half) of the rate ofinflation69. This version, by contrast, could lead to unpredictably large reductions in the real valueof pensions if there were a resurgence of inflation.   If inflation were 10 per cent, its use in1982 could yield  30-50 million in 1982-83 and  90-140 million in a full year.(iv) Guaranteed inflation-proofing up to, say, 10 per cent, but discretion to abate increasesabove that level70. In our view, this combined approach is more likely than (i) - (iii) above to provideMinisters with the discretion to act in particular circumstances without generating needlessalarm on the part of employees and pensioners because of the unpredictable way in which
CONFIDENTIALthe provisions could work. Pensioners might indeed still improve their relative position ifthere were a combination of low inflation and falling real earnings; conversely, high inflationand rising real incomes would leave pensioners relatively worse off. If Ministers wished topursue an option on the broad lines of this approach, further work could be done on the levelof the limit, and further refinements could be considered. It would, for example, be possibleto include limitations on the exercise of discretion, perhaps on the lines of variant (ii)discussed in paragraph 68 above. For each percentage point by which inflation exceeded10 per cent in November 1982, a maximum saving of  28 million in a full year,  10 million in1982-83, would be possible.A &quot;MIXED&quot; COURSE71. In the light of the emphasis on early legislation and implementation, we think &quot;mixed&quot;courses should be avoided as far as possible.72. If the main response to this report is to take action on contributions, this wouldpresumably be related specifically to the benefit of index-linking, and a change in benefitsat the same time would make those higher contributions more difficult to achieve.73. The same arguments do not, however, apply precisely in reverse. The application ofeither Course C or Course D would still leave a wide disparity in contribution rates (CivilService effective rate of 8i per cent; many other services 6 per cent) for comparablebenefits; and the benefits would still include a substantial degree of index-linking.74. Under Course C or D, therefore, there would still be a case for aligning contributionsin the public services, and there might be grounds for arguing that this should be at the levelof Civil Service contributions rather than the lower level of other services.75. There would, however, be substantial negotiating difficulties, since the propositionwould be higher contributions for worse benefits. Similar considerations would apply on thecontributions side, therefore, to those discussed in relation to Course A.76. There is one other respect in which possible action on benefits and contributions mayneed to be handled simultaneously. Our Progress Report suggested that negotiatingadvantage might be obtained by the presentation of alternatives. For instance, the actual orimplied threat of Course D could help towards obtaining rapid acquiescence to Course B.
CONFIDENTIALPOSITION OF THE WIDER PUBLIC SECTOR77. The discussion so far in this report has concerned itself solely with the position of thepublic services (ie schemes in the first section of Annex A). E Committee took the viewthat in principle the assumption should be that any change would be applied to all publicsector schemes. It is therefore necessary to consider the wider public sector, and inparticular the nationalised industries.78. All the nationalised industry schemes are funded. The operations of the funds, whichare controlled by trustees, are independent of both Government and industry (in 1971 theGovernment revoked the orders requiring Ministerial consent to changes in the terms of thepension schemes). Pension arrangements have hitherto been a matter for negotiationbetween the industry and its employees; action by the Government to influence thesearrangements would be an unprecedented direct intervention by Government in thebargaining process.79. Some nationalised industries are to move to the private sector shortly, and it might bedifficult to explain why their funds, which are index-linked and similar to funds of industrieswhich will remain in the public sector, should be free from any controls proposed for fundswhich remain in the public sector. This difficulty is greater in the cases where parts of anationalised industry have moved into the private sector and new funds, with rules modelledon those of the parent industry&apos;s scheme have been set up and were acceptable to theinvesting institutions.I - COURSES A AND B80. The only way of applying Course A or Course B directly to the nationalised industrieswould be to legislate so as to require the imposition of the relevant level of employeecontributions. Such legislation might be hybrid; but we have not investigated this aspect,since other objections seem decisive. These are as follows:.a. It would be a large incursion by the Government into the settlement of the termsand conditions of service of nationalised industry workers. It is the Government&apos;sgeneral policy, which it has recently reaffirmed, not to intervene in the pensionarrangements of nationalised industries.b. The underlying purpose of Courses A and B is to make employees pay more forthe same benefits. It would not be possible to ensure that this purpose wasfulfilled unless Ministers were prepared to take power also to control benefits innationalised industry pension schemes: without such a power, the increase inemployee contributions could be used to finance increases in basic benefits
CONFIDENTIALbeyond what is provided by public service schemes. This would take Ministersstraight back into the detailed control of nationalised industries pension termswhich was abandoned in the early 1970&apos;s. Alternatively (and perhaps morelikely), higher contributions might be immediately offset by pay increases.It could be added that Course B, with its mixture of accruing cost and PAYG contributions,would be hard to reconcile with the genuinely funded nature of nationalised industry pensionschemes.II - COURSES C AND D81. An objection on the lines of that in paragraph 80(a) above could also be made againstan attempt to apply Course C or D to nationalised industries. However, it would have lessforce, since it would be possible to reply on the following lines.(a) The cost of inflation-proofing is particularly difficult to forecast, and hence tofund with confidence.(b) Hence, if the nationalised industries offer inflation-proofed benefits, they areimplicitly relying on the fact that the Exchequer ultimately guarantees theircontinued existence.(c) The resulting contingent liability is as a matter of principle unacceptable to theGovernment, which will therefore require the industries not to go further thanpublic service practice, which it endorses.82. Course C or Course D would, in fact, apply automatically to the majority ofnationalised industry pension schemes, since they provide inflation-proofing through a linkwith the public service pensions increase system. The Nationalised Industries&apos; Chairmen&apos;sGroup (NICG) has drawn attention to this fact in its observations to the Government(attached at Annex F). However, it might be thought unsatisfactory to take no furtheraction. First, a number of important nationalised industry schemes (including those of gas,electricity and coal) would be unaffected. Secondly, there would be nothing to preventindustries from amending their schemes so as to provide inflation-proofing by a direct linkwith the retail price index (RPI), as some already do.83. Legislation directly to require nationalised industry schemes to break an existing linkwith the RPI would almost certainly involve the abrogation of contractual rights andtherefore expose the Government to the risk of a successful action under the EuropeanConvention of Human Rights. This risk could be avoided by limiting the effects of thelegislation to future entrants, or to schemes which do not already have a direct link with theRPI; but the resulting solution would be bound to be criticised as unfair and anomalous.
CONFIDENTIALCertainly it would fall short of meeting the wish of Ministers for broad uniformity across thepublic sector.84. Another approach would be to make the withdrawal of index-linking a condition ofGovernment financial assistance to meet operating losses or enable a capital reconstruction.This would suffer from serious disadvantages.a. It would affect only some industries; the monopoly industries could always passthe burden of index-linking to the consumer.b. Those industries which were caught would be affected at different times and indifferent circumstances: the upshot would be a long drawn out series of battles,no doubt including strikes and the threats of strikes.We do not think this approach would be satisfactory.Use of the tax system85. A quite different approach would be to act through the tax system. It could be made acondition of Inland Revenue approval for pension schemes that increases in benefits afteraward should not exceed those payable under the pensions increase legislation in force fromtime to time. The new condition would apply to existing as well as to newly created ormodified schemes.86. This might avoid the potential difficulties under the European Convention of HumanRights mentioned earlier in this report, since the legislation would not itself abrogate, orrequire the abrogation of, existing contractual rights. But, since the loss of Inland Revenueapproval has severe financial consequences for a pension scheme, there would be a strongincentive to both employers and employees to renegotiate pension terms so as to come intoline.87. This approach would inevitably affect the private as well as the public sector, sincethe same tax rules apply to both. However, this could be justified on the grounds that thereis no reason why the taxpayer should assist private sector schemes, through tax concessions,to provide levels of pensions increase which, ex hypothesi Parliament had decided to be soobjectionable in the public services as to require legislation to defeat current expectationsof index-linking.88. The Inland Revenue are clear that a limitation of this sort could not be imposed by theexercise of their discretion under the existing law: fresh primary legislation would berequired. In broad terms, this would require pension schemes so to arrange their rules as toprevent the payment of pensions increase which, on a cumulative basis, was more generous
CONFIDENTIALthan that paid in public service schemes. Unlike other legislative changes discussed in thisreport, it could be included in a Finance Bill.89. This would be a departure from previous practice in that it would require schemesalready in existence and enjoying Revenue approval to include new restrictions in their rules:many pension schemes permit increases in line with increases in the RPI (even if in practicethey are unable to be so generous), and their rules would have to be amended to prevent thisif it were more generous than public service practice. In the circumstances, it might bethought excessive to expose such schemes to the full consequences of loss of Revenueapproval (principally, assessment of employees to tax on both their own and their employer&apos;scontributions, and assessment to tax of the pension fund on both its income and its capitalgains); and some less severe penalty might be devised, such as partial or completewithdrawal of relief on the income and capital gains of the fund.90. If Ministers favoured this approach, the details would need to be considered furtherand discussed with the pension industry. Legislation could not be ready for enactmentearlier than the 1983 Finance Bill; and it would be necessary to allow a transitional period ofseveral years thereafter in which schemes would adapt themselves to the new requirements.91. This approach has attractions as a way of applying Course C or Course D to the widerpublic sector without appearing to single public sector schemes out for unfavourabletreatment; and there is an argument of equity in favour of limiting tax relief to privatesector schemes in line with what can be afforded in the public services. It would not beconsistent for private sector pension interests, which have so strongly criticised index-linking in the public services, to object to the imposition of limitations on post-awardincreases in both public and private sectors.92. Nevertheless, the approach would be likely to be heavily criticised by the pensionsindustry. The main lines of attack would probably be as follows:(a) the approach was unnecessary, because few private sector schemes in practiceprovided full inflation-proofing;(b) it was unreasonable, since those private sector schemes which could afford toprovide full inflation-proofing should be allowed to do so;(c) it was simply an indirect way of forcing employers to go back on contractualobligations freely entered into or to pay a price in the loss of tax benefits forsomething which they cannot now go back on, and which at the time they enteredinto the agreement was perfectly lawful;(d) particularly under Course D, decisions taken by Ministers about the pensionsincrease which could be afforded in the public services could affect much of theprivate sector, which might be in quite different circumstances.
CONFIDENTIAL93. There would be a reasonable defence to these arguments. The fewer the schemesaffected, the less objection there should be to the changes; schemes that can afford fullindex-linking can do so, in large measure, only because of tax concessions; and if thecriticism at paragraph 92(c) were thought to be damaging, it could be met by exemptingschemes which had an explicit link with the RPI (though this would mean exempting anumber of nationalised industry schemes at which the exercise was in large measuredirected).94. The Committee believes that the arguments of principle favour use of the tax route ifMinisters select Course C or D. But Ministers will wish to balance against these argumentsthe likelihood of strong objections from the pensions industry.WIDER PUBLIC SECTOR: CONCLUSION95. In our view, the following conclusion may be drawn.(a) If Ministers were to act on contributions for public service schemes, this mightbe reflected in nationalised industry practice; but it would be pointless toattempt to enforce such a result in the absence of detailed control overnationalised industry pension benefits and the extent to which highercontributions might be offset by higher pay.(b) If Ministers were to act on benefits, their lead would be more likely to befollowed; the terms of many nationalised industry schemes are directly linked tothe pensions increase legislation. But there are important exceptions; andschemes could always link their pension increase explicitly to the RPI.96. An attempt to solve the problem outlined in paragraph 95b by direct legislation wouldexpose the Government to the risk of a successful action under the European Convention ofHuman Rights. The alternatives are:(a) relying on the automatic effects outlined in paragraph 82 above and encouragingthe NICG to use their best endeavours to withdraw index-linking where it exists:the recently instituted arrangements for monitoring nationalised industry pensionschemes would provide a mechanism for maintaining pressure on the industries tomake the necessary changes (or for resisting the reintroduction of index-linkingin schemes automatically affected by Courses C or D); and(b) use of the tax system on the lines described in paragraphs 85 to 94 above: thereare good arguments in favour of this; but it would be strongly resisted by thepensions industry.
CONFIDENTIALGENERAL ASSESSMENT97. The options considered in this report have been discussed in terms of all theirimplications as far as we have been able to identify them. On such a contentious issue, andone in which our own interests are involved, we refrain from presenting a recommendedcourse. There are, however, some conclusions we would tentatively draw.98. On contributions, we think there is a good case for action to harmonise contributionlevels. Those schemes in which the contributions take the form of a reduction in grosssalary (civil service and armed forces) are the only ones in which the cost of inflation-proofing has been systematically taken into account in fixing the contribution level. In othercases the (lower) contribution levels were determined on other grounds; and it can be arguedthat they do not take full account of index-linking. At least, therefore, increasingcontributions in these cases would be justified in terms of pensions policy, since similarbenefits should be accompanied by similar contributions.99- Secondly, if one takes the present level of Civil Service contributions as the datumpoint, there would be justification for raising this, within the context of the system that hasexisted hitherto, simply on actuarial grounds - the Government Actuary has already used,for the Pay Review Bodies, a lower assumption for the real rate of interest than that whichwas used for the 1980 Civil Service pay settlement. There are, however, three argumentsagainst this:a. The actuarial argument would support only a very small increase (about i percent) for the Civil Service; a bigger increase would have to be argued on moregeneral grounds.b. The actuarial assessment was part of a comprehensive comparison of totalremuneration that is no longer made.c. An assessment which was valid for the Civil Service would not necessarily be sofor other services.100. Ideally, arrangements for pensions increase should not be financially segregated fromthe arrangements for &quot;basic&quot; pensions. The total contributions required to maintain basicpensions are likely to vary inversely in relation to those necessary to finance pensionsincrease: it therefore makes sense to run the two together if possible. If one wereembarking on a substantial reconstruction of public service pension schemes to achieve this,one might well be led in the direction of Course A.101. But it would involve substantial changes, which would take time to negotiate andimplement. Furthermore, the outcome would be uncertain, particularly since the suspension
CONFIDENTIALof comparability has knocked away even the possibly contentious datum point of the CivilService. We therefore think that the supplementary charge envisage in Course B would be amore practicable means of obtaining higher contributions in respect of the generality ofpublic services. Under Course B the degree of inflation-proofing in the private sector is thedatum, and anything above that in the public sector is to be paid for by public servantsdirectly on a pay-as-you-go basis; the level of basic contribution for most services wouldremain as now. Thus there would be no new objective justification for basic contributions;but there would be an objective means of determining the supplementary charge. Technicaland negotiating issues are more straightforward than under Course A; and, in this context,the fact that pensions increase is (in the main) separately financed from basic pensionsbecomes a convenience.102. As argued in paragraphs 5 and 6 above, it is anyway desirable to make the Civil Servicepension scheme formally contributory. Course B would leave the Civil Service at leastinitially paying an effective rate of contribution (after adjusting for making the schemecontributory) very little different from at present. Actual contributions would, however, behigher than now (and net pay lower) as the converse of the bigger pensions based on grosspay under a formally contributory scheme.103. Under either Course A or Course B the maximum potential savings would be large,running into hundreds of millions of pounds a year. There would, however, be dangers oferosion through higher pay. These would be somewhat easier to resist under Course B thanCourse A though, ultimately, market considerations put a floor under the value of the totalreward package (pay plus pensions) and so constrain the extent to which contributions can beraised without affecting pay.104. On benefits, the arguments go both ways and involve a more political choice. It can berepresented as unfair, on the one hand, that public service pensioners should have the realvalue of their pensions protected, while private sector schemes do not give suchundertakings. On the other hand, it can be argued that the State should not use inflation toreduce the real value of obligations forming part of implicit bargains with its employees.(Some general considerations were discussed in paragraphs 8-18 of our Progress Report).105. The first of the arguments in the above paragraph again introduces comparison withthe private sector. However, neither Course C nor Course D (which reduce benefits) aredirectly aimed at imitating private sector practice. Course C involves an automatic formula(with the advantages and disadvantages of that); Course D involves Ministerial discretion - inthat case, interest would centre on how the discretion should be exercised and how far itshould be curtailed in the legislation itself. Any argument for a similar degree of inflation-proofing in the public services as in the private sector needs to take account of the fact
CONFIDENTIALthat, at least in the case of the civil service and armed forces, the effective contributions,much higher than those in the private sector, have specifically provided for inflation-proofing at a price accepted by the Government at the time. A curtailment of benefits inline with the degree of inflation-proofing historically offered by the private sector wouldtherefore entail a reduction in civil service contributions, and thus in respect of thoseservices an initial cost to the Government probably greater than the savings of pensions.Course D is designed to minimise this repercussion as far as practicable by maintaining thepresumption of index-linking.106. Under Courses C and D there would also be the problem of retrospection. The adviceof the Attorney-General is that, at least in the case of the Civil Service, legislationaffecting pensions increase would not interfere with previously existing contractual rights.But some legal risk is involved, particularly if there were to be a challenge in the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights. The issue of retrospection would not arise on Courses A or B.107. Finally, there is the position of the wider public sector, chiefly the nationalisedindustries. There is no way of imposing Courses A or B on the industries. Courses C or Dwould apply automatically to many of the industries, but not to all; and, unless furtheraction were taken, schemes could always change their rules so as to avoid their effects. IfMinisters wished to avoid these consequences, the most promising approach would be to actthrough the tax system on the lines described in paragraphs 85 to 94 above. That would haveto cover the private sector as well as nationalised industries; and there are good argumentsof principle for this. However, it would not be free from difficulties; and it would bestrongly criticised by the pensions industry.108. There is no doubt that failure to apply whatever Ministers may decide for the publicservices to the wider public sector will be heavily criticised by public service staff interests.Nevertheless, in view of the complications, which would need to be considered further ifCourse C or D were to be followed, we think that Ministers&apos; decisions on the public servicesshould be taken on their own merits and not be determined by the position relating tonationalised industries.109. The arguments on both sides of the contributions/benefits issue can thus besummarised as follows:(i)     In favour of action on contributions:(a) This is the most natural response to the Scott Report; the arguments for someincreases in public service contributions are difficult to refute.(b) It is easier to reconcile with the Government&apos;s political commitments.(c) It avoids the problem of retrospection.   It cannot be argued to be inconsistent
CONFIDENTIALwith moral obligations.(d) In the form of Course B, it is based to a larger degree on objective evidence anddoes not involve the exercise of discretion. If it is accepted at the outset, itshould prove a stable solution.(e) It should yield larger savings, certainly in the first instance, and probably in thelonger term. Course B, for example, in effect charges employees with half thecost of pensions increase; but it is very unlikely that any of the variants ofCourse C or Course D could be operated so as over time to halve the rate ofpensions increase.(ii)    In favour of action on benefits:(f) It would make public service pension benefits more comparable with those on theprivate sector.(g) The general approach could be applied to at least a substantial part of the publicsector outside the public services (though, for the reasons indicated inparagraphs 107 and 108 we do not regard this as decisive since the only way ofensuring reasonably general application would be to operate through the taxsystem in a way which might prove contentious).(h) In the form of Course D it would give Ministers greater flexibility.CONSULTATIONS110. Whatever course is preferred, Ministers are committed to consulting a wide variety ofinterests (in particular, by the Prime Minister&apos;s announcement of the terms of reference ofthe Scott Committee): trade unions, and other employers in the public sector as a minimum;and possibly, in addition, representatives of public service pensioners and, particularly ifMinisters were to decide on an approach involving changes in the tax regime, private sectorpension interests. It seems desirable to arrange for the early issue of a document setting outthe Government&apos;s views as a basis for consultation.

CONFIDENTIALANNEX BEFFECT OF EACH COUl&amp;E ON THE MAIN PUBLIC SERVICE SCHEMESCourse A (a general increase in contributions)1. Table 1 sets out how Course A would affect each of the main public servicepension schemes, on the assumption of a general increase in contributions toaround 10% of pay.   The gross savings, in terms of employee contribution incometo the schemes would be approaching  o00 million.    As explained in the report,however, this may considerably overstate the likely savings to the Exchequer,both because 10% may not be attainable and because the saving may be erodedby offsetting pay increases.    If a contribution rate of 9% had to be settledfor, the gross savings would come down to nearly  600 million, even before theeffects of any offsetting pay increase.Course B (partial pay-as-you-go contributions)2. Under this course, existing contributions would remain unchanged, exceptthat the Civil Service would be charged 6% by deduction from gross pay ratherthan, as now, by reducing pay rates themselves .p0 A. jfA^her charge would belevied of 2-% for the non-uniformed services and^3l% for the uniformed services(except possibly the aimed forces).    If such a charge were levied on the armedforces, the existing pay reduction made by the AFPRB would probably be less.3. The effects on each service are summarised in Table 2.   The gross savingsamount to nearly  500 million and public servants as a whole would be meetingaround half the current cost of index-linking.k.     These estimates depend in part on assumptions about the immediate effecton pay of any change in contribution arrangements.    It is, for example, assumedin Table 2 that because the total contribution from the Civil Service wouldbe little different from that in the 1980 pay research settlement, the net gainfrom Course B would be small - ie, that there would have to be virtually full/immediate offset through higher pay.   But there would be an argument for takingthe line that:(a) the change to a contributory scheme charging 6% for basic benefitsshould be precisely offset through higher pay (but allowing for the highervalue of pension benefits); but(b) any further offset on account of the special charge for pensionsincrease was a matter for negotiation.The gross savings from Course B in respect of the Civil Service would then beabout  1^0 million.5.     On the other hand, as pointed out in the body of the report, there areother groups of staff in the public services (eg in the NHS) who could claimthat their pay had been determined by recent comparability exercises which hadallowed for the value of index-linking, and that they should therefore receivean increase in pay to offset the higher level of pension contributions.6. And, of course, even if there were no immediate offset, the savings wouldstill be eroded by later pay increases.
CONFIDENTIAL7. These arguments apply in a broadly similar way to both Course A and CourseB.    It follows that too much weight should not be placed on apparent differences,in the yield of the two courses.Courses C and D (limitation of index-linking)8. Pensions increases apply in the same way to all public services. Thereforethe consequences of changing these benefits do not vary from service to service,as do the effects of Courses A and B, which tackle contributions.9. It is impossible to say how much each of the variants of the two coursesmight save without specifying its precise form and making assumptions aboutthe future course of inflation and the use that Ministers might make of anydiscretion under each variant.    However, as an indication of the possibilities,the savings from increasing pensions at the 1982 uprating by 1?i&gt; less than therate of inflation would be distributed approximately as follows:	  millionCivil Service	Local government	Teachers	rtNHS	rt .Armed Forces	5Police and fire	2Overseas	12810.     The savings from holding pension increases below the rate of inflationfrom year to year v;ould be cumulative.    However, there would presumably be apractical limit on the total reduction that could be imposed on the real valueof pensions.   And a substantial reduction in the real value of pensions wouldgenerate pressure for reductions in contributions, higher pay, or other improve-ments in conditions of service.

CONFIDENTIALANNEX CA CONTRIBUTORY CIVIL SERVICE PENSION SCHEME?IntroductionThis paper discusses some of the main implications of making thePrincipal Civil Service Pension Scheme fully contributory. Atpresent male civil servants pay direct contributions of Ifyfo ofsalary towards the Widows Pension Scheme (WPS); basic pensionbenefits and pension increases are paid for by means of adjust-ments to gross pay.   Under a fully contributory scheme the separatepay adjustments and WPS contributions would be replaced by a con-tribution from gross pay covering all benefits.Effects on Pay and Pensions2. It would be broadly consistent with the Government Actuary&apos;scalculations in the 1930 pay research exercise to increasesalaries by 6.5$ and to levy contributions of 8.5$ for men and 7$for women (the difference reflecting the fact that most women donot pay contributions for dependants* benefits).   As is usual in acontributory scheme, pensions would be based on the higher grosspensionable pay and would therefore be bigger than at present. Non-pensionable emoluments based on pensionable pay, such as overtime,would also increase.    Higher pensions would, however, be paid forby a cut of about 1$ in net pay: there would be no increase in publicexpenditure or central government borrowing.3. One major advantage of such a change is that it would removethe need for complex pension adjustments under a pay comparabilitysystem, while ensuring that a proper contribution was actually beingpaid.    It remains for consideration whether pensions should betotally separated from pay determination by the setting up of a free-standing system for determining and adjusting pension contributions.The Megaw Inquiry will no doubt be considering this as part of itswider examination of the system of determining civil service pay.Contribution Levels4. The precise level of contribution would need to be determinedin the light of Ministers&apos; decisions on the options discussed in thisReport.    If it is decided that men and women should pay the samecontribution, there would undoubtedly be pressure for pensions to bepaid as of right to the widowers of all women civil servants, or forcontributions to be lower for women than for men.    Either changecould have important repercussions in other schemes, in particular,the teachers&apos;  NHS and local government schemes when the same contributions arepaid by all, but dependants&apos; benefits, except in very restricted circumstancesare paid only to men&apos;s dependants.-1-CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALInland Revenue Limits5. The Inland Revenue limit for the receipt of tax relief onpension contributions is 15$ of salary.    A move to a fully contri-butory scheme, particularly if it were at a high contribution level,would therefore require special arrangements for some civilservants who pay additional contributions out of gross salary towardsadded years or enhancement of widows* pensions in respect of pre-1972 service.    The Inland Revenue are being consulted about this.Union Reactions6. It is likely that more senior staff would welcome a fullycontributory scheme while more junior staff would be concerned atthe cut   in net pay. This difference of view would be reflected inthe views of individual unions, though the majority would probablyfavour the change.    They would, however, all be likely to resistany increase in contributions much above 8-g$.   Under section 1(3)of the Superannuation Act 1972, the unions would have to be consultedabout such a change.    It might, however, be helpful presentationallyif the proposal for the change came initially from the Unionsthemselves.Timing7. A number of technical matters, raising important questionsof superannuation policy, would need to be considered and discussedwith the unions.   None of these are insoluble, but it would taketime to study them and negotiate the necessary amendments to thescheme.   It would also be necessary to adjust administrative payrolland computer systems.    It is unlikely, therefore, that the changecould be introduced before April 1984.    If decisions were dependenton the results of the Megaw Inquiry into civil service pay the changecould take longer.Financial Effects8. An increase in pay of 6.5$ and the levy of contributionsat 8.5$ (men) and 7$(women) should be financially neutral in the longrun, lower net pay being offset by higher pensions.   For severalyears, however, there would be a net saving because higher pensionswould take time to work through.   Against these savings, refunds ofcontributions could increase, as could overtime rates.   The longerterm effect of this could, however, be to a great extent offset bymaking London Weighting non-pensionable.   The financial implicationswould then be as follows:CONFIDENTIAL

The Scott report drew attention to the complexity of thearrangements under which civil servants now pay for their pensions,and the misunderstanding to which this gives rise.   The introductionof a fully contributory scheme would have important presentationaladvantages.    The public confusion surrounding the present arrangementswould be dispelled, and civil servants would be clearly seen to bepaying a pension contribution about twice the private sector average.In the short term, however, the change would need to be carefullypresented, for though it would not involve an increase in publicexpenditure, the higher gross pay could be misrepresented as a payincrease and pensions would be seen to be bigger.    It might appear, therefore, that civil servants were paying with one hand and receivingback rather more with the other.    The likely effect on nationalearnings statistics would also need careful consideration.10. It might therefore be advisable not to make such a changeat the same time as an annual pay settlement, to avoid theimpression that pay was being further increased.   However, foradministrative simplicity a pay settlement date might be preferable,in particular the first which followed the introduction of a new paysystem arising out of the Megaw Inquiry.   At such a time it wouldalso be easier for serving civil servants to accept the cut in netpay that would result from changing to a fully contributory scheme.Decisions on such matters would not, however, be required for someCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtime after a decision in principle had been taken to make thechange.   That decision would imply willingness to face the shortterm presentational problem for the sake of the long term gain andthe secure knowledge that proper payment was being made for pensionbenefits.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEX DSCHEME FOR EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE VARIABLE TO REFLECTNON-FULFILMENT OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONSThe actuarial approach which underlies Course A is forward-looking:    it uses assumptions for the future in order todetermine a contribution, appropriate to a &quot;new entrant&quot;,which is then applied to all currently in service. Anysystematic under - or over - provision (if it is believedto be a continuing one) can be corrected in the case of futurenew entrants, and partially corrected in the case of thosewith some time still to serve.    But, in general, by-gonesare by-gones and any miscalculation eventually affects theemployer.    Course B, on the other hand, ties the cost ofpensions (at least in so far as inflation is concerned) backto the reality of emerging costs and adds a consequentialcharge to contributions - but that leaves each generationpaying on behalf of its predecessor   a contribution whichmight be inappropriate for its own pensions.2.     There would be attraction, if it could be worked, inan actuarially-based scheme in which the fulfilment orotherwise of assumptions is regularly and automaticallychecked and inadequate or excessive employee contributionsare corrected on a basis which adjusts for the past as wellas provides for the future.    There would still be some roughjustice between past and present employees;    but such a systemwould come as close as practicable to ensuring that individualspay a proper share (however that may be determined) of thevalue of their pension rights.J.     The simplest route to this broad result is notionalfunding, with deficits being recovered (or surpluses remitted)over a short period of years through changes in contributionrates.4. The NHS and teachers schemes are notionally funded, buton a different basis. They are deemed to be invested solelyin fixed interest securities, and the funds do not bear thecost of pensions increase. The funds determine contributionsfrom employers but not from employees. The local governmentscheme is actually funded but, again, the fund does not bearthe cost of pension increases.5-      It would be possible to change the way in which thesethree schemes operate-, so as to approximate to what isdescribed in paragraph 2, and to constitute other public sector
CONFIDENTIAL- 2 -schemes on this basis.    But in administrative terms it wouldbe a bigger undertaking than other courses discussed in thereport.   And various aspects of the reform would be contentious,difficult to negotiate and probably complex in terms oflegislation.    Some particular difficulties are discussed below:-(a) In order to assess the existing and accruingliabilities of a pension scheme, data are requiredabout the scheme&apos;s members and pensioners, particular!statistical breakdowns by age, marital status andsex.      In addition, for scheme members only, detailswould be needed of length of service and, at leastinitially, contributions paid.    It would also benecessary to know about entitlements under thestate scheme.    Some of this information is notcurrently available;    some of it is available only ininappropriate form.(b) Decisions would be needed on the notional investmentportfolios.    This has caused controversy in theteachers&apos;  scheme, which would be intensified whenpensions increase became a liability of the notionalfund and employee contributions made dependent onfund performance.   To invest notionally in fixedinterest Government stock, as with the existingnotional funds, would be untenable.    Staff mightexpect investment exclusively in index-linked stock;but this would imply notional investment exceeding thetotal quantity of index-linked stock available toother investors.    It would be practicable, andmore realistic, to base performance on that of actualpension funds;    but unions might not be satisfiedwith this.(c) When the scheme was working, there would still beproblems in deciding the allocation of surpluses/deficiencies as between employers and employees. Itwould be difficult to treat differentiallydivergencies which arose from changed assumptionson inflation or real interest rates as against thoserelated to, say, withdrawal rates;    any attemptto do so might require the operation of two notionalfunds for each scheme, one reflecting actualexperience and the other &quot;normalised&quot; in relationto any factors not to be reflected in changedcontributions.    Probably it would be necessary toagree in advance with staff interests on a standarddivision of pension costs and to apply this tothe treatment of surpluses and deficiencies inthe notional fund.   Agreement would not be easyto reach or maintain.(d) It would be necessary to decide how rapidlycorrections should be made.    The actuarial
CONFIDENTIAL-3 -assumptions to be used would be applied to a longrange of future years.    Quite small changes in, forinstance, the postulated real rate of return couldthrow up deficits or surpluses which, if corrected overa short run of years, would result in sharplyvarying contributions;    if the correction were spreadover longer periods, a bigger discrepancy would arisebetween the expected value of benefits and thecontributions made towards them, and to that extent thescheme would fail to meet its object.(e) It would be difficult to start any new notional fundon any basis other than wiping the slate clean inrespect of any possible surplus/deficit derived fromthe past;    we are advised that it would be impossibleto create a fund retrospectively.    The presentationalproblem would be greatest in the case of existingnotional funds:    additional notional assets would haveto be credited to them in order to balance the newliabilities for pensions increase which the fundswould be taking on.(f) A scheme of this kind is more appropriate to a system ofpay comparability than standing on its own. Allsystems need a starting point, which for the civilservice has been provided by the pay researchanalogues.   For other services (and perhaps for thecivil service in future) contributions to free-standing pension schemes are more arbitrarilydetermined, whereas an actuarial approach towardsvarying contributions presupposes more objectivejustification for the basic level.(g) In the case of the teachers and local authorities, theincorporation into funds and notional funds ofliabilities for pensions increase and contributionstowards these would shift the financial balancebetween the employers and the Exchequer.    The generalreconstruction of public service pension schemeswould need to take account of this.6.     A refinement intended to reduce the rough justice inCourse B, and create an employee pension contributionwhich is variable on an actuarial basis in relation to pastexperience as well as to future expectations, would thusnot be a simple one.    It would be a novel principle inpension practice (private or public) and require substantialchanges in the constitution of all public service pensionschemes.

As a matter of general principle, whilst Parliament iscompetent to do it, no Government should take away from itsemployees without adequate compensation any legal rights whichhave vested in them and bear a monetary value.   There are twoperspectives from which any proposal which mipht in fringe thi[;principle must be viewed.    The first is that of UK domesticlaw, namely whether there are any existing legal rights whichcould now be enforced in the UK Courts.    Secondly, there arethe obligations of a High Contracting Party to the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights, which may be the subject ofproceedings first in the European Commission of Human Rightsand subsequently in the Court.4. The Attorney General has been able to study the pensionarrangements for civil servants under the legislation and thePrincipal Civil Service Pension Scheme.    lie advises thatwhether or not there is any contractual entitlement to apension (upon which it is not necessary for him to express aview) civil servants have&apos; no contractual right to pensionincreases.    Pension increases are governed by statutoryprovisions which may be changed without giving rise to anyclaim in contract.

Accordingly, in relation to the Civil Service, thereis no legal right recognised in the UK Courts which shouldrestrain the Government from proposing legislation to removeor reduce the index-linking of benefits-   However, in theAttorney General&apos;s view Ministers should give seriousconsideration before formulating their policy to whether oneparticular class of civil servant or pensioner has a validmoral claim to be safeguarded against its effects.   This isthe class of those who have purchased added years at a pricewhich includes an element in respect of the index-linkingof benefits, if those benefits are to be materially worsened,in his view:-(1) such persons should be compensated by the returnof a proportion of the amount they have alreadyoaid, in making a specific election to buy addedyears, for a benefit which will have fallen invalue owing to the policy - this despite the factthere will be an element of arbitrariness in anyscheme for determining the amount payable ascompensation;(2) those still paying on a periodical basis at thetime the legislation comes into force should havethe right to cease participating and be creditedwith years of service by reference to the amountof their contributions to date: and(3) for those who elect to continue, there should be areassessment of the level of their payment for theadded years which would reflect the alteration inthe value of their pension.(1) above applies equally to those who have transferredprevious pension entitlements into the PCSPS, and for whomthe number of years to be credited has been assessed byreference to the index-linked nature of civil service benefits.6.     Article 1 of the 1st Protocol to the European Conventionon Human Rights provides that &quot;no one shall be deprived ofhis possessions except in the public interest and subject tothe conditions provided by law and by the general principlesof international law&quot;.

The Attorney General considers that there is a realrisk of proceedings under this Article being instituted byan aggrieved civil servant or pensioner.    If it were, ourpossible defences would include the arguments that the&quot;right&quot; to pensions increases, being non-contractual, didnot fall within the Article at all;    that the Government&apos;sdecision that the action was required &quot;in the publicinterest&quot; was within its legitimate margin of appreciation;and that the obligation to pay compensation, deriving fromthe reference to &quot;the general principles of internationallaw&quot;, does not bind a State in respect of its own nationals.The Attorney General considers that the first of these  arguments stands a reasonable chance of being successfuland that the second is even more likely (though not certain)to succeed:    but the third, which we are already advancingin other current cases, may well be rejected.8. On balance, the Attorney General considers that ourchances of eventually deflecting a challenge under theConvention are better than even but that the risk of anadverse finding is not negligible.    Naturally, the degreeof risk will be affected by the severity of the optionchosen.    The Attorney General also wishes to point out that,in the two &quot;special cases&quot; referred to in paragraph 5above, the existence of safeguards on the lines he hasproposed would tend to strengthen the Government&apos;s positionbefore the Court.9. Since he has not been provided with any information theAttorney General has not been able to consider the detailsof any other public sector pension arrangements (all thesewere within the terms of reference of the Scott Committee andof VP).     Where other groups of public servants have nocontractual right to pensions increase (either because thisdepends entirely on Statute or upon the terms of a schemewhich is freely amendable), the same principles as above arelikely to apply.10. However, the Attorney General notes from Table 5 inAppendix 3 to the Scott Committee Report that in relation tovarious public sector pension schemes (including, for example,those of the Post Office, British Steel and London Transport,a total of 622,000 employees) benefits are inflation-proofed/underCONFIDENTIAL

Legislation which sought to extend to theseschemes would be highly complex and different in naturefrom a straightforward amendment to the pensions increaseLegislation such as would be needed for the civil service.Moreover, if there are contractual rights in any of thesecases to pensions increases (and the rules may containprovision against worsening) the Attorney General considersthat legislation designed to override these rights withoutadequate compensation would carry a greater risk of theGovernment&apos;s being held to be in breach of the provisionsof the European Convention referred to above.11. Finally, the Attorney General wishes to re-emphasisethat the problem must be seen in the broad context of all.   public sector schemes, whereas his legal advice is necessarilyrestricted to the civil service scheme.    Presumably anydecision by Ministers to change the position adverseley wouldhave to be &quot;across the board&quot; of the public sector in orderto be acceptable politically.   But Ministers must, in theAttorney General&apos;s view, be made aware that (a) thelegislation would be extremely complex and take some timeto prepare: and (b) in respect of other parts of the publicsector could involve more substantial difficulties of legalprinciple, and in proceedings before the European Court.This in turn might suggest that a fully comprehensive schemeshould not be embarked upon.12.

---------- ^ A-NNCX- p/  s ctt &quot; &apos; r re -&gt; 1 -NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES&apos;  CHAIRMEN&apos;S GROUPObservations on the Scott Reporton Index-Linked Pensions1.   The Nationalised Industries&apos; Chairmen&apos;s Group wishes to present itsobservations on the Report of the Scott Inquiry into the value of index-linked pensions, (Cmnd 8147).SUMMARY2. The whole complex of pension-cum-pay arrangements existing in the publicsector industries differs very substantially from the overall patternexisting elsewhere in the public sector (paras 3-9 below).   As a resultit would neither be desirable, nor indeed practicable, to include thepublic sector businesses directly within the scope of any legislativeaction which the Government may take regarding changes in index-linkingarrangements in the public services (para 10 below).   However, theChairmen&apos;s Group accepts that individual Corporations could reasonably berequested to examine their present index-linking provisions if theGovernment and Parliament were to alter the arrangements currentlyoperating in the rest   of the public sector, (see para 13 below). Indeed,for the majority of the Corporations, there could be an automatic impact ifthe Pensions (Increase) Acts were to be amended in certain ways, (para 12below).DIFFERENCES IN PENSION AND PAY ARRANGEMENTS3. NICG submitted a substantial memorandum of evidence to the Scott Inquiryproviding information and comment on aspects of the pension arrangementsin the public sector industries of common concern to all or mostCorporations.   In addition, further detailed information was provided byIndividual Corporations, either directly to the Scott Inquiry or throughtheir sponsor Departments and the Civil Service Department. Forconvenience, a copy of the factual Appendix to the NICG evidence isattached to this submission.4. Two main features stood out from this evidence:--a. the Corporations&apos; pension arrangements differ considerably from thosein the public services, in a number of major respects; andb. pension arrangements differ appreciably from Corporation toCorporation.5. With regard to the general shape of pension arrangements, there are twofundamental differences between the position in the public sectorindustries and that in the public services:-a.   The Corporation&apos;s schemes are almost all   operated on a contributorybasis, whereas public service schemes are mostly operated on a non-contributory basis.
b.    The Corporation&apos;s schemes are almost always operated on a &quot;funded&quot;basis and subject to actuarial valuations, (ie the expectation is thatpayments to their pensioners will be financed from the returns on theiraccumulated funds), whereas public services schemes are normallyoperated on a &quot;pay as you go&quot; basis, (ie the payments to theirpensioners are financed by calls on the public purse).In addition, there are a number of other technical differences In theoperation of the schemes which have a substantial impact on Individualpensioners: eg the public service schemes are more favourable both in termgof the nominal pensionable age and in relation to the account taken ofentitlement to the State pension.6. With regard to the arrangements for the index-linking of pension benefits,a further basic difference exists.   Whereas the public servicesarrangements are governed by Statute, such statutory guarantees exist inonly two cases In the public sector businesses.    In all other cases, theprovision made for some degree of index-linking stems, in effect, fromunderstandings of some sort between the Corporations concerned and theiremployees/Unions, which have subsequently been incorporated in the rulesof their pension schemes.   How far this process would be reversible ifa Corporation wished to reduce index-linking benefits will depend in parton whether the formal provisions governing the amendment of the rules ofits pension scheme allow the Corporation concerned to act unilaterally,or whether they require the agreement of the Trustees and/or members.Be that as it may, however, there is also the practical consideration that,whatever the rules may say, the Unions concerned would certainly expectto be consulted in advance about any reduction in benefits, and could beexpected to oppose them strongly.7. That point leads on to a still-wider difference between the public servicesand the public sector businesses, viz the ways in which pensions issuesare fitted into the whole complex of decisions about the &quot;totalremuneration package&quot; of employees.   The Civil Service has traditionallytended to determine pay levels on the basis of elaborate comparabilityexercises; and they have then worked out offsetting deductions foradvantages enjoyed in areas such as non-contributory pensions, guaranteedindex-linking, greater job security, etc by means of other highlyformalised procedures.   The public sector businesses, on the other hand,have traditionally determined the total remuneration package, and settledthe balance between pay, pensions and other elements in that total package,in much the same way as applies throughout industry as a whole, ie by meansof &quot;trade offs&quot; negotiated on an ad hoc basis.8. Thus, if the Government were to decide on a new method of appraising thevalue of index-linked pensions for public service employees, there is noway in which an exactly comparable adjustment could be made to theindividual Corporations&apos; pay/pension arrangemer -s,.   For reasons alreadyexposed, the two situations are entirely differeit.   At most, theCorporations could only attempt to follow suit indirectly, either byseeking to increase their employees&apos; pension contributions, or by seekingto restrain their next pay increase, or some combination of both. Whethersuch action would succeed would depend essentially on the Corporations&apos;negotiating strength vis^-a-vis their Unions at the particular point intime; and that issue would be unlikely to be influenced by nice actuarialcalculations of the value of index-linking.
9.10.11.12.POLICY IMPLICATIONSThe Chairmen&apos;s Group hopes that, when the Government comes to considerwhat stance it should take on the Scott Report,  two matters will be borneparticularly in mind with regard to the position of the Corporations:-a. Firstly,  it should be recognised that, whereas the Government is thedirect employer in the case of the public services, this is not thecase of the public sector businesses.b. Secondly, full account should be taken of the point demonstrated inparagraphs 3-8 above, viz,  that there are very considerable differencesbetween the public services and the Corporations, both as regards theirpension arrangements and as regards the ways in which those pensionarrangements impact on pay settlements.Accordingly,  the Chairmen&apos;s Group believes that the Government shouldconsider the position of the Corporations quite separately from that ofthe public services.    Such a course would be wholly in line with thestatement by the Scott Inquiry that Its findings were to be regarded asones applicable to &quot;all areas of the public sector where pay is determinedby comparability exercises&quot;, (Report, para 11) - a formulation whicheffectively left the Corporations aside.The Chairmen&apos;s Group recognises, however, that the provisions now madefor the index-linking of pensions in the public sector Corporations couldnot simply continue unquestioned if Parliament were to make significantchanges in the arrangements currently operating elsewhere in the publicsector.    Indeed, the sentence from the Scott Report quoted above asjustifying the exclusion of the Corporations from the direct scope of anyGovernment decisions goes on to recommend that, &quot;in areas of the publicsector where comparability exercises are not used, the pay negotiatorsought to draw on our findings to assess whether proper account is currentlybeing taken of differences in pensions in their arrangements&quot;, (Report,para 11).To a considerable degree, such a review would occur automatically in theevent of a significant change in the public services&apos;  index linkingarrangements.   Out of 31 pension schemes in 19 Corporations, 24 providefor increases in line with those guaranteed to retired public servantsunder the existing provisions of the Pensions (Increases) Acts, and sowould be directly affected by any amendment of those Acts which had theeffect of limiting the size of the Increases granted.   Most of the other7 schemes provide for increases calculated by direct reference to theRetail Price Index; and In these cases, revision would not be automatic.However, the Corporations concerned would naturally tend to review theirsituation if the benefits hitherto granted to other public sector employeeswere limited in a way which left their own pension benefits at anexceptionally favourable level In relative terms.Despite this assurance of more-or-less automatic action, it may be thatthe Government will still wish to draw its decisions on index-linkingarrangements In the public services to the attention of the Corporations.In this event, the responses of the Corporations would, of course, be amatter for individual decisions, and not for the NICG collectively. Forits part&quot;, however, the Chairmen&apos;s Group takes the view that Corporationscould reasonably be expected to agree to examine their  present index-
mlinking provisions if the Government and Parliament were to alter thearrangements currently operating in the rest of the public sector. Asalready noted in paragraph 6, however, any such reviews of pensionarrangements - and hence of the associated pay arrangements - would have tibe made in conjunction with the Trustees of the pension funds concerned,and with employees and their Unions.So far, this memorandum had focused on the possibility that the Governmentmay favour changes in the present arrangements for index-linking in thepublic services which would reduce the present benefits to some extent.It must be borne in mind, however, that this is not the main thrust ofthe Scott Report.    Its central conclusion favours a wider extension ofthe principle of index-1inking, with the Report declaring it to be &quot;ahighly desirable social objective that the standard of living of those inretirement should be protected&quot;, (para 6).   And as to the mode ofprogression towards that objective, the recommendations of the Report placless stress on &quot;levelling down&quot; the benefits currently provided in thepublic sector than on &quot;levelling up&quot; the benefits currently provided inthe private sector where, though about two-thirds of all the largeremployers are now awarding pension increases covering a significantproportion of the increases in living costs, the Scott Report statesroundly that, the general pattern is &quot;not good enough&quot;, (para 41).
