CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 27 COPY NO 815 June 1981CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1981-82Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department1. On 14 May (CC(81) \9th Conclusions, Minute 6), the Cabinet consideredthe recommendations of The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future LegislationCommittee (QL), as set out in C(81) 22 and 23, for the legislative programmefor the 1981-82 Session of Parliament.    Some concern was expressed that theproposed programme did not place sufficient emphasis on the Government&apos;smain strategic objectives, and QL were invited to review the programme withthe aim of including mere major policy Bills, if necessary at the expense ofsome of the more technical measures already recommended for the mainprogramme.    QL have now considered this remit, and have decided torecommend the modified programme set out in Annexes A to D.2. With the agreement of the Ministers concerned, QL propose that theCurrency and Banking, International Military Services (Financial Provisions),Teachers&apos; Remuneration and Conditions of Service, Territorial Sea, WirelessTelegraphy (Amendment) and Co-operative Development Agency (Amendment)Bills should all be dropped from the programme for 1981-82 which theCommittee originally proposed.     It was suggested at the last Cabinetdiscussion of thj s subject that the proposed Mental Health (Amendment) Billmight also be deferred, but the Committee felt strongly that this would be amistake ia terms of the overall balance of &quot;the programme, the likely reactionof our own supporters (including Lord Butler), and the probability that themore attractive provisions would be taken up by a Private Member.3. The six Bills now proposed for deferment are, by definition, of a lessdemanding character than the major programme Bills, and their postponementoffers only limitec. scope for additions to the programme.    Against this back-ground, QL considered the case for adding further Bills sponsored by theSecretaries of State for Energy, the Environment and Defence.4. The Cabinet has already decided that room should be found in theprogramme for the Gas (Industrial and Commercial Supplies) Bill. CLcontinue to have the gravest doubts about whether the Department of Energycan effectively manage four Bills, two of them substantial, and all potentially1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhighly controversial, in the 1981-82 Session.    If the Cabinet nevertheless con-firm their earlier decision, the Committee believe it to be essential that meansshould be found to improve on the timetable for preparation of the Bill. Thepresent estimate of policy approval in June, instructions to Counsel in October,and introduction in February 1982 makes it highly unlikely, in view of the natureof the Bill, that it could be close to completing its passage by the SummerRecess next year, and it would be very vulnerable in the spillover in theautumn of 1982.    The worst of all worlds would be to postpone a number ofother measures in favour of a Bill which it eventually proved impossible tocarry.5. The Secretary of State for the Environment proposed to drop his bid fora Public Bodies (Management) Bill, but to transfer tne building controlprovisions from that Bill to the Housing Bill already accepted by QL;  to putthe establishment of the Accounts Commission into a new Local GovernmentFinance Bill dealing primarily with interim action on rates;  and to deal withthe abolition of the National Water Council and the restructuring of regionalwater authorities in a separate Water Bill.6. The case for the inclusion of the Housing Bill in next Session&apos;slegislative programme largely depends on the very substantial staff savings forthe Department of Health and Social Security which would result from theintroduction of unified housing benefit.    The other measures proposed for theBill, though important, would not in the view of QL justify a place in thelegislative programme in their own right, and the Committee do not considerthat room can be found for all of them.    If the building control provisions areincluded, the private sector rent deregulation provisions or other provisions ofequivalent length and importance may have to be omitted.    The Home andSocial Affairs Committee have already agreed that the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster and Paymaster General should retain the right to propose someabridgement of the Bill when the policy on all the proposed provisions has beensettled.7. QL recognised the need for interim rating legislation next Session.There was some doubt about the need for including in the legislation provisionsabout an Accounts Commission (12 clauses, compared with five on ratingproper), but the Committee noted that the Secretary of State for theEnvironment accorded this a higher priority than the reform cf the waterindustry.    They therefore recommend the inclusion of a Local GovernmentFinance Bill in the form proposed by the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, but conclude that that would not leave room In the programmefor the less essential Water Bill.8. The Secretary of State for Defence, in response to the views expressedat the Cabinet&apos;s last discussion of the legislative programme, has put forwarda new proposal for a Bill to permit the sale of the Royal Ordnance Factories.QL acknowledged that legislation of this kind would meet the criteria set bythe Cabinet, be popular with our own supporters (though not necessarily amongCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthose with constituency interests), and make a contribution towards reducingpublic sector manpower figures.    The proposal has, however, come forwardvery late.    The policy has yet to be agreed, and the Bill would be highlycontroversial.     The Committee concluded that the Bill&apos;s claims were notstrong enough to justify substituting it for another major measure, and that itwould be preferable to defer it to next year, when there will have been time forfuller policy consideration.9. QL agreed that the provision:in the now deferred Currency and BankingBill permitting the word &quot;new&quot; to be omitted before the word &quot;pence&quot; on futureissues of the coinage should be transferred to a separate Coinage Bill of per-haps only one effective clause, on condition that the Bill proves acceptable forSecond Reading Committee procedure in the Commons.10. Although QL&apos;s revised recommendations would reduce the number ofmain programme Bills to 18 (compared with the 22 proposed in C(81) 22), theywould greatly increase both the overall weight of the programme and thedifficulties of Parliamentary handling.    All but three of the main programmeBills are now potentially highly controversial, and only six are likely to besuitable for Lords introduction.    Royal Assent for seven is essential ordesirable before the Whitsun Recess of 1982, and for another four by July 1982.Even if these demands can be met, it is likely that several other major Billswill not reach the Lords in time for their passage to be completed by theSummer Recess, and that there will again be a substantial spillover in theautumn of 1982.11. Against this background, it is clear that no major addition to theproposed programme - including a possible Canada Bill if it cannot be pe.ssedthis Session - should be contemplated, either now or after the beginning of nextSession, unless some other measure of comparable importance (such as theInsolvency Bill) is dropped.    It is imperative that the timings for thepreparation of Bills given in the Annexes to C(81) 23 should not be allowed toslip and should, wherever possible, be bettered.    Any difficulties should bereported to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster immediately.12. I invite my colleagues to:i. Approve the proposed revised legislative programme set out inAnnexes A to D.ii. Note the need for the timetable for the preparation of the Gas(Industrial and Commercial Supplies) Bill to be improved.iii. Note the position reached on the Housing Bill (paragraph 6).iv. Endorse the conclusions in paragraph 11 above.W WHeme Office5 June 19813CONFIDENTIAL
