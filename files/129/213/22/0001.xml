CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 4721 September 1981THE QUEEN&apos;S SPEECHES ON THE PROROGATION ANDOPENING OF PARLIAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department1. I attach drafts of The Queen&apos;s Speeches on the prorogation of thecurrent Session of Parliament and the opening of the 1981-82 Session.These have been prepared by The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future LegislationCommittee (QL) on the basis of texts suggested by colleagues and (in thecase of the draft opening speech) in the light of the legislative programmeapproved by the Cabinet on 30 July (CC(81) 30th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. The draft prorogation speech summarises the achievements of the1980  8l Session.     Prorogation speeches rarely attract much public orParliamentary attention, and QL agreed that we should keep the speech thisyear as short as possible.    The text as it now stands is less than two-thirdsthe length of last year&apos;s.3. The draft opening speech is only a little shorter than last year&apos;s, but,in view of the heavy legislative programme facing us next Session, it would bedifficult to compress it further without distorting its general balance. Ishould direct colleagues&apos; particular attention to three issues discussed by QLwhich have some policy implications:-i. The reference on page 2 to the close relationship between theUnited Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland has not appeared inprevious opening speeches.    It could be helpful in the context of thecontinuing Anglo-Irish talks, but it will be resented in some quarters,and, once included, will be difficult to omit from future speeches.ii. The economic affairs section (pages 2 and 3) has beenredrafted by the Treasury in the light of discussion in QL.Colleagues will wish to consider whether the tone and content ofthis crucial passage accurately reflect cur intended economicstrategy for the coming Session.COPY NOCABINET1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALiii. QL  were concerned that the first drafts of the NorthernIreland passage (page 4) and the corresponding passage in thedraft prorogation speech (page 5) did little more than repeat phrasesfrom previous years&apos; speeches,    Itis difficult, in the absence of anyconstructive response to our latest policy proposals, to make thesereferences much more positive ill tone, but the draft speeches nowincorporate revised texts prepared by the Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland at QL&apos;s request.4. The Royal Visits mentioned in the square bracketed passage on page 1of the draft opening speech have still to be confirmed.    Some other referencesmay require revision before the speech is delivered, and a passage on Canadamay have to be added if a formal request for legislation to patriate theconstitution is received from the Federal Parliament by then,5. Since QL discussed the two draft speeches, the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy (E) have agreed that the legislation to improve theaccountability of local authorities in the levying of rates should be givenpriority over the rest of the programme with the aim of securing Royal Assentby February 1982.    The Committee recognised that this might mean that othermain programme Bills for 1981-82 might have to be deferred or dropped inorder to free the additional Parliamentary time which would be required in theearly part of the Session to meet this accelerated timetable.    I have discussedthe new position with the business managers and with First Parliamentar/Counsel and we are agreed that bearing in mind the continuing uncertaintyabout the timing of the legislation on the Canadian constitution, we shall needto drop at least two main programme Bills.    We propose that the highlycontroversial Social Security Bill, which requires Royal Assent by April 1982,should be deleted from the programme together with either the Housing andBuilding Control Bill or the proposed legislation on the retailing of gasappliances.    To free resources for work on the Local Government FinanceBill, Parliamentary Counsel will have to delay the preparation of the MentalHealth (Amendment) Bill, but it should not be necessary to delete it from theprogramme altogether.    I should add that even with the deletion of two othermain programme Bills, the business managers have serious reservationsabout meeting the timetable envisaged by E Committee for the rating legislation,particularly in the Lords.    It would improve the chances of meeting the time-table of the Bill if it were confined to the question of rates, but the Secretaryof State for the Environment is opposed to this.6. Subject to the points mentioned in paragraphs 3 to 5 above, and to anylater revisions which may be necessary before the speeches are delivered, Iinvite the Cabinet to approve the attached drafts.W.
