CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 37COPY NO      n 417 July 1981CABINETTAX AMD PUELIC EXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerOUR GENERAL APPROACH1. At our meeting on 17 June (CC(8l) 23rd Conclusions) we endorsedthe objective of maintaining our present economic strategy.2. We aljo agreed to consider further in the context of the 1981Public Expenditure Survey the balance to be struck between taxation andpublis expenditure.    We noted that during our term of office so far theburdens of tax and public expenditure have both increased, directlycontrary to our expectations and our promises.TAXATION.3. The present burden of tax is far too high.    It is one of the mainfactors hindering the growth of new employment opportunities.    It ishigher as a percentage of output than it was in Labour&apos;s last year.Although the basic rate of income tax has been reduced, there has been asubstantial increase in indirect taxes, the starting point for income tax islower in real terms, and National Insurance contributions have beenincreased.    As a result, 48-| per cent of the income of a married man onaverage earnings is now taken in direct and indirect tax, contributions andrates; when we first took office it was 45 per cent.    Many more lower,paid people have been pulled into tax.    And although we have made soreuseful changes in the structure of company taxation, the real burden onindustry has not been appreciably reduced;  the rates of Corporation Taxand National Insurance Surcharge (NIS) are unchanged.4. To help reduce unemployment, and for other sound social andeconomic reasons we must do better.    A priority must be to raisesubstantially the starting point for income tax.    This is essential in orderto widen the gap between incomes in and out of work, to improve incentivesfor the lower paid and to ease the poverty trap.    Raising the income taxthreshold would also encourage greater restraint in pay bargaining. Wealso need to reduce the tax burden on business;  a cut in the NationalInsurance Surcharge would directly reduce labour costs, encourage firmsto take on more people, and improve profitability.    Tax reductions of thiskind are a better way of stimulating real employment, and likely to do soto greater effect and with better long term consequences, than additionalpublic expenditure which further increases the involvement of the publicsector.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. It follows that a reduction in the burden of taxation is central tothe achievement, of cur objectives and must have a very high priority.THE ECONOMY6. As explained when we discussed economic strategy on 17 June,the background against which \/e have to look at our tax and publicexpenditure strategies is one in which the world economy will be slowlyrecovering from the present recession and our own economy adjusting toa lower rate of inflation and the effects of North Sea oil.7. The fall in output appears now to have come to an end.    But thepace of recovery is uncertain, as the wide array of forecasts indicate.The crucial question is the speed at which inflation adjusts to decliningmonetary growth.    On this much will depend on what happens on paysettlements this autumn and winter.    Partly owing to the recent fall insterling, inflation may not fall as fast as previously expected this year,with something of a pause in coming months.8. Our policies for public expenditure, taxation and reducinginflation are not exempt from the judgment of the markets. Untilrecently that judgment, by raising the exchange rate, has been helping usto secure a rapid reduction of inflation;  and to shelter        interest ratesand hence British industry and employment from the full effect of UnitedStates interest rates, to which our Community partners have been moreexposed.    If however the view takes hold in the markets that our deter-mination is weakening, we could find ourselves increasingly exposed toUnited States interest rates and to damage to our efforts to reduceinflation.    This is something we must have in mind in taking ourexpenditure decisions.9. Provided expectations of lower inflation are maintained, thereshould be some increase in output in 1982, and a rather bigger increasein 1933 that should halt the rise in unemployment in that year.    But giventhe likely world environment, and with business profitability still underpressu.&apos;o, it would be unrealistic to expect any strong resurgence of theeconomy in the next tv/o years.10. In all the circumstances, and consistently with our decision on17 June, we must stick with the medium-term financial strategy and thepath of the declining Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (as a proportionof Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) set out there.    This should bringinflation down well into single figures and permit a fall in interest ratesover the medium-term.    But holding to that strategy will require sometough decisions.    The way we may be affected by factors we do not controlonly means we must make sure we stick to policies where we do.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPUBLIC EXPENDITURE11. The key to our chances of being able to make tax reductions lies inpublic expenditure.    The Government&apos;s record on this ir *o far a disappoint-ment, to ourselves and to our supporters.    We said in the March WhitePaper that the planned public expenditure totals there indicated are higherthan we should wish, and that tuis requires most serious attention in thecurrent Survey.    We must new implement that.12. Even just to make good the reduction in real personal tax allowancesimposed in the last two Budgets, and to provide some tax relief to ease thefinancial pressures on business requires that our total public expenditureplans are no higher than in the Match White Paper,,13. But expenditure at this level would still mean an overall tax burden -taxes plus National Insurance contributions plus local rates - higher thanwhen we came to office.    (At the moment, if we exclude the North Sea it is39^ per cent of GDPj it was 35 per cent when we came into office;  and theMarch White Paper plans would imply about 37 per cent by 1983-84). Abroad ready reckoner is that each  1 billion cash reduction in puhlicexpenditure (divided roughly equally between current expenditure on goodsand services and transfers) would enable us to reduce taxes by  l-| billion.To get the overall tax burden back by 1983-84 to the level at which it stoodwhen we came to office requires a substantial reduction in the White Fapeipublic expenditure plans.    But it would, for example, make possible a realstimulus to employment by enabling us to restore the starting point forincome tax to the 1979-80 level and ease substantially the burden of the NIS.We could also begin to make progress towards fulfilling other long-standingpledges such as an easing of the burden of the capital taxes.14. Yet it is clear from the Survey so far that there are going to beserious problems even holding to the March White Paper totals. Therewill be a slight increase from unemployment forecasts somewhat worse thanassumed in the White Paper.    But the main threat is from bids foradditions to programmes.    These are diverse in nature, and arise for awide variety of reasons of differing weight.    Discussion will no doubt leadto changes but the present crude total for next year, 1982-83, exceeds 6-| billion in cash.    Of this some  2|- billion is fur additions tonationalised Industrie s&apos;&quot;iCxternal Financing Limits*     There is a bid ofnearly  1^ billion for unemployment measures, much of which remains tobe  settled.    And there are bids for increases in the majority of otherprogrammes too.We have the problem of overspending by local authorities. Theoverspend in the current year will be substantial despite the counter actiontaken.    We should do all we can to contain this.    The Chief Secretary willbe suggesting timely guidance about plans for current expenditure in 1982-83111 a separate paper for discussion alongside this one (C(81) 38).3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL16. There are good arguments in favour of some shift within vprogrammes in favour of capital rather than current expenditure.    It isdisappointing that most of the bids for additions are for current expenditure,ox in the case of the nationalised industries to make good reduced internalfinance.17. Public services pay accounts for some 30 per cent of the publicexpenditure planning total.    The lower we can get pay, the better theservices we can provide.    Eut we must not be unrealistic.    It would bequite wrong to base our plans for other expenditure on an assumption aboutpay which we cannot fulfil.    This is the difficulty about the otherwiseattractive suggestion of linking pay with capital projects, which isdiscussed in the annex to this paper.    There may be some possibility ofdoing this in certain fields.    I should welcome, not later than September,any suggestions from colleagues responsible for particular paynegotiations and capital programmes how the idea might be developed intheir areas, e g the National Health Service, the armed forces.18. But our overwhelming concern must be with the totals. Forthese it is not neceesary at this stage to propose a precise objective,nor do I intend to do so.    Amongst other things I would expect that beforethis is done, the Chief Secretary will examine individual programmes,But the proposals now emerging would lead to higher totals than the cashequivalent of the March White Paper.    Within them the proportion ofcapital would be lower.    This is tne opposite of what both we and oursupporters think right.    Far from enabling us to reduce taxesf it wouldmean that we would have to increase taxes even further in the remainingBudgets of this Parliament.    To go down that road would be economicallydamaging and politically impossible.19. It is against this background of political, economic and socialconsiderations all pointing to restraint of public expenditure plans belowthose derived from the March White Paper that we must approach thepresent Survev and the current nationalised industries investment andfinancing review.    Whatever the case for increases in certain areas ofspecial priority, our overriding aim muit be to get the overall expendituretotals down below those derived from the White Paper.CONCLUSION20. I invite Cabinet to endorse the general approach to the publicexpenditure Survey indicated in this paper, and in particular theoverriding aim in paragraph 19 so as to make possible within our overalleconomic strategy the tax reductions necessary for fulfilling oureconomic and employment objectives.G HTreasury Chambers!7 July 1981 4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALannexPAY AND CAPITAL PROJECTSIt has been suggested that the provision for pay should be reduced tomake room for an increase for capital projects.2. It is possible to make this trade-off to some extent for publicexpenditure in total.   But we must not make plans for capital (or other)expenditure which depend on provision for pay which is unrealioticallylow.3. And it would be difficult to introduce the trade-off between pay andcapital investment into the negotiation of public sector pay at thislevel of aggregation.   The link between pay for, say, doctors andinvestment in, say, roads or in the public sector as a whole is tooindirect. h.     The best opportunity to link capital spending to the outcome of paynegotiations, and to make it an element in these&apos; negotiations, is where  all the following conditions are fulfilled:(a) there is a clearly defined cash limit within whichboth pay and capital expenditure have to be found, so thatthe trade-off is clear eg the EFL for a nationalised industry,the cash limit for the NHS;(b) the pay negotiations within that cash limit are self-contained, and within the control of the Minister or managerresponsible for the cash limit;(c) either the unions have a direct interest in a higherlevel of investment, because it means higher employment, or. the continued viability of the industry, or   moral andpolitical suasion can be applied by the Government saying&quot;we would have liked to have had more investment but the moneywent as pay instead&quot;;1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL(d) additional investment in that area is desirable onmerits;(e) it is practical to arrange that the capital expenditureis not committed until the savings on pay are secured.5. This approach has been used for some nationalised industries. Forexample the Government has linked investment with pay and productivityfor the railways.    It is for consideration whether it could be introducedfor other areas eg the National Health Service, the Armed Forces andDefence.6. But it would be difficult to apply to:(a) local authority pay.   V/hile the Rate Support Grant isa cash limit, local authority pay is not directly controlledwithin a cash limit.   How would the Central Government besure enough of savings on pay to increase the cash limit onlocal authority capital until too la^e in the year?   It wouldbe difficult to make the capital/pay trade-off an effectiveelement in a particular negotiation;(b) Civil Service pay.    The combination of central negotiationson pay and many cash limits including Civil Service pay wouldmake it difficult to establish a trade-off.7. Nevertheless we should not lose sight of the possibility over timeof achieving more on civil service and local authority pay, perhaps bydifferential treatment of different groups, the introduction of regionalpay variations, etc.
