RESTRICTEDHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 26?, Julie 1981CABINETCOPY NO81CONTROL OF EXPENDITURE:DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIESNote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord Fresident of the Council1. As the Ministers in charge of the two central Departments, viz theTreasury and the Civil Service Department (CSD), we have been consideringthe contribution which our Departments should make to the Government1 sobjectives of the restraint and control of public expenditure and CivilService manpower, and of the improvement of the efficiency of the publicservices.2. Successful prosecution of these policies, aiming as they do at theefficient use of resources, depends principally on;-i.        sound decisions by Ministers collectively on the totalof public expenditure and on its distribution between thedifferent programmes;ii.        sound management of the resources so allocated by theMinisters in charge of spending Departments and by theofficials responsible to them down the line of management.3. In the management of the resources allotted to each programme,the role of the responsible spending Department is critical.    It is here thatboth strengths and weaknesses will be chiefly manifest.    But the centralDepartments have also a role and responsibility, to co-ordinate, to encourageand to seek to spread good systems and good practice.4. As a Government, we seek to emphasise the personal responsibilityof departmental Ministers in these matters.    In practice much of the taskmust be and is devolved to the Civil Service.    As Ministers, we shouldcontinue to strive to foster and encourage the highest standards of manage-ment throughout the Civil Service.1RESTRICTED
RESTRICTED5. The attached memorandum summarises, as we see them, therespective roles of the central Departments and of the spending Departments.It is part of the programme which Sir Derek Rayner mapped out for us underthe heading &quot;lasting reforms&quot;.    It will be complemented by notes defining insimilar fashion the functions of Ministers,  Permanent Secretaries,Principal Finance Officers and Principal Establishment Officers.6. Much of the memorandum is a re-statement and a clearerdefinition of existing responsibilities and practice.    But it also reflects ourconclusion that, in order to strengthen our drive for economy and efficiencythroughout the public services, the Treasury and the CSD should berecognised to have a role in, and responsibility for, promoting the develop-ment and operation of the best possible systems in Departments.7. This is not novel in principle.    But in recent years the emphasishas been in decentralisation and on the responsibility of the spendingDepartments for their own efficiency.    We have no intention of detractingfrom, or in any way undermining, the responsibilities of the spendingDepartments.   But we believe that, in partnership with the spendingDepartments, and as a complement to their work, the central Departmentsshould be more active and more positive in setting standards aad seeing thatthey are observed,8. Major tasks to be pursued in the period ahead include the develop-ment of cash planning of public expenditure, which we are pursuing in the1981 public expenditure survey;  further development of managementaccounting, both to identify the full cost of Government operations and tointegrate it more effectively into expenditure control;   succession policy forsenior staff;   training and staffing policies to meet the needs foreseen;programme and project evaluation;   more effective development of internalaudit.9. The Public Accounts Committee, the Treasury and CSD Committee,and perhaps other Select Committees, are likely to become aware of theexistence of the memorandum, and may ask to see it.    There will be no harm,and may be some advantage, in volunteering copies;  which would in effectpublish it.    This would mean similarly releasing copies of the notes on theresponsibilities of the Principal Finance Officer and Principal EstablishmentOfficer referred to in paragraph 19 of the memorandum.    We so propose.10. We invite colleagues to endorse the attached memorandum onDepartmental responsibilities, and its release to Parliamentary Committees,and hence publicly.G HSTreasury Chambers2 June 1981 2RESTRICTED
CONTROL OF EXPENDITURE:DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIESThe allocation of financial and manpower resources to Governmentdepartments, and the control and efficient use of those resources,call for constructive partnership and co-operation between theTreasury and the Civil Service Department as central departmentson the one hand and the spending departments on the other.Effective co-operation requires understanding of the proper roleand responsibilities of each.2. The purpose of this memorandum is to summarise thoserespective responsibilities.     They are in each case responsibilitiesof departments as a whole.     For this purpose there is no distinctionbetween Ministers and officials;    the department is headed by theMinister in charge and the officials are responsible to the Minister.3. In this memorandum the term &quot;spending departments&quot; applies togovernment departments.     The &apos;arrangements are somewhat differentwhere the actual spending is the responsibility of nationalisedindustries, local authorities, or other fringe bodies, with a&quot;sponsor&quot; department between them and the central departmentconcerned.A.    Responsibilities of Spending Departments4. The primary     responsibility of e. spending department is toconduct its Minister&apos;s policy and its statutory functions to thebest effect within the financial and manpower limits determinedby the Government as&apos;a whole.     Each Minister, advised by hisdepartment, will have participated in deciding those limitscollectively.5. The department is responsible for ensuring that the resources,both financial and manpower, allocated to it are used efficiently.
6. The department is responsible for ensuring that the controltotals represented by any cash limits or other policies applyingto the whole or parts of the relevant programmes are strictlyobserved, and that the requirements of expenditure and manpowercontrol as laid down from time to time are respected.7. Within the department all levels of management carryresponsibility for the efficient use of the resources entrustedto them.     Certain special responsibilities of Principal FinanceOfficers (PFOs) and Principal Establishment Officers (PEOs) arediscussed below (paragraphs 17-20).B.    Responsibilities of the Treasury and the Civil ServiceDepartment8. The responsibilities of the Treasury and Civil ServiceDepartment include the following.9. The Treasury advises Ministers collectively on mattersconcerning the total of financial resources for the public sectorand its relationship both to the Government1s broad objectivesand to the economic and financial environment; and makes proposalsas to distribution of the total among departmental programmes,taking account of Government policies and commitments.     The CivilService Department performs a similar function in respect of CivilService manpower and related expenditure.&apos;10.    In their respective fields the Treasury and Civil ServiceDepartment are responsible for defining the essential elements ofan adequate system to monitor and control the use of resourcesallocated to departments.     It is their duty to verify that suchsystems are in operation, both within the central departments andwithin spending departments.     They should consult the departmentsconcerned to check that requirements proposed are apt to the functionsof the departments and to the needs of the public interest, inparticular as to their cost.11.    This duty includes:
(i) prescribing the basic elements of departmentalsystems which are needed to provide (a) reliable andcompatible information for the purpose of centralco-ordination and control;    (b) where central prescriptionis needed, satisfactory arrangements for monitoring andcontrol within departments;(ii) setting standards of adequacy for such systems(departments are then responsible for meeting thosestandards);(iii) checking that these systems are working reliablyand that corrective action is taken promptly and effectivelywhere they indicate the need;    and, if weaknesses of systembecome apparent, identifying, with the department, thechanges that are needed; and(iv) checking that each department is applying effectiveand adequate arrangements to promote efficiency bothgenerally and in individual cases in order to fulfil thatdepartment&apos;s responsibility for efficiency (paragraph 5) 12.   By long-established convention, expenditure must not beincurred without the approval of the Treasury or Civil ServiceDepartment.     In practice, in consultation with spending departments,the central departments determine categories of delegated authorityfor expenditure.     Outside the delegated categories the Treasuryand the CSD are to be consulted specifically.     This provides anopportunity of external check on how the department&apos;s ownprocedures are being applied in practice, and also for the Treasuryor CSD to examine a selection of the more important proposalsfor new expenditure which have a direct bearing on their responsi-bilities for overall allocation.     In addition the Treasury andthe CSD may from time to time examine with a department \tfhethera particular operation is being conducted with maximum efficiency.1-3    More generally, the Treasury has responsibility to advise
departments on economic and financial matters, includingParliamentary aspects,  and the Civil Service Department oncivil service staffing and staff-related matters.    Both theTreasury and the Civil Service Department have a responsibilityto define and,  in collaboration with departments,  to maintainproper practices in the handling and .expenditure of public money.14. The Treasury also has a number of other co-ordinatingresponsibilities,  for example for general aspects of publicpurchasing policy and of policies concerning pay in the publicservices.15. The Civil Service Department is responsible for:-(i) Central policies concerning the training and personnelmanagement of the civil service, and for ensuring that thetop ranks in departments are filled, and can continue tobe filled, by those regarded as the best available afterconsideration of candidates drawn from the service as awhole.(ii) Civil Service recruitment policy and such recruitmentas is carried out centrally.(iii) The settlement of pay, pensions and other conditionsof service, and of grading standards, throughout the civil  service.(iv) Computer policy and the procurement of computers foruse in Government departments.(v) The development of staff inspection and,  in consultationwith the Treasury, of management services throughout thecivil service, encouraging the introduction of new andimproved management techniques and spreading knowledge ofbest practice.
C.    Co-operation:  Finance and Establishment Divisions16. The interacting responsibilities described above call forco-operation between central and spending departments at alllevels.17. Departmental finance and establishments divisions havea key role in their departments&apos;  relationships with theTreasury expenditure divisions and CSD manpower divisionsrespectively.-   The responsibility of the Principal Finance Officerand Principal Establishment Officer will vary to some extentwith the circumstances of different departments.    But in broadterms the Principal Finance Officer is responsible to thePermanent Secretary for the general quality of the department&apos;ssystems for control and economy in the use of money, and foradvising the Permanent Secretary on the quality of those areasof financial management which fall within the responsibilityof line managers;  for ensuring that any limits which have beendecided upon are not exceeded;  for ensuring financial proprietyand regularity at all times;  and for monitoring the use by linemanagers of financial authority delegated to them by or onbehalf of the Permanent Secretary.18. The Principal Establishment Officer is responsible to thePermanent Secretary for the control and disposal of manpower;for the efficient administration of the department,  in particularthrough the operation of manpower planning and systems ofpersonnel management;  and for the conduct of industrial relations.19. More detailed notes prepared by the Treasury and the CSDdescribe in more detail    the respective responsibilities of thePFO and PEO.20. Within the normal framework of their responsibilities totheir Minister,  finance and establishment divisions should workwith the Treasury and the CSD to ensure that planned limitsare observed,  that their departments co-operate generally incarrying out the responsibilities indicated in Section B, andspecifically:
(a) that the Treasury or the CSD are consulted inadvance on any new proposals outside the categories ofdelegated authority, or which would commit the Governmentto find resources additional to the agreed programme; and(under the Cabinet Office rules) before a paper is circulatedto Cabinet or to a Cabinet Committee containing a proposalwith expenditure or manpower implications.(b) that the central departments are provided with anyinformation needed for fulfilment of their responsibilitiesfor allocation, control and central management.(c) more generally that central departments are consultedat a formative stage in policy discussions which could havesubstantial financial or manpower implications.HM TREASURYCIVIL SERVICE DEPARTMENT28 May 1981
