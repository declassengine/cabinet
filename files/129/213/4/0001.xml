CONFIDENTIAL.ECONOMIC STRATEGYNote by the  Chancellor of the ExchequerThis paper is  intended to help us to take stock of our first twoyears of office and to  identify the key  issues we need to face inthe remainder of this Parliament and  in preparation for the next.2. Our objectives are clear- We aim to break out of the circle of high inflation, lowproductivity,  poor market disciplines and responses, poormanagement and progressive devaluation.    These are allclosely], inked. - Success  in this  is essential for a sustainable growth ofoutput,  employment and living standards.This means   .. .- we must substantially improve the efficiency and thecompetitiveness of the economy.    And ...- we must bring inflation down and keep it down.3. As we made clear in our Manifesto,  bringing about the necessaryfundamental changes -  not  least changes  in attitude on the part ofmanagement and  labour towards the disciplines of competition andhonest money -  is not  easy.    This  is especially so given the yearsof neglect,  the tougher world setting and the competition we facefrom economies overseas which are much fitter than our own.    We havemade significant progress already.    We have to consider the next stageSet ting the scene4. Throughout the industrial world inflation accelerated and growthslowed down during the 1970s. Almost everywhere this was accompaniedby sluggish productivity and rising unemployment.5.      The second oil price shock  (oil price $17 a barrel on pollingday and about  $34 early this month)  has seriously worsened theprospects for the world economy over the next few years. GrowthProspects  for the  1980s have been scaled down markedly. Earlierhopes that,  once the first oil price shock had been absorbed, the- 1 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALworld economy would regain the growth rates enjoyed in the  1960s havlong since been abandoned.     In most  industrial countries there aredoubts whether growth  in the  1980s will reach even the  level recordedin the  1970s.     In short,  the world setting is much harsher thanexpected when we came into office.6.      The acceleration of inflation and slowdown in growth has beenespecially bad in Britain.    Chart A shows how,  through two decades,money incomes grew increasingly fast  - much faster in fact, thanin other industrial countries - while growth of real output sloweddown.    Between  1970 and 1980 output grew only  16 per cent. Butmoney incomes  increased by 335 per cent.    In other industrialcountries the increase in earnings over the period of the second oilshock was much more moderate than  in the UK.7. .    We are thus badly handicapped by a serious decline in our abilityto compete.    As  Chart B shows,  this  is because our wage costs haverisen much more steeply than those of our competitors and,  to a muchlesser extent,   because North Sea oil  has prevented them from beingaccommodated to the same extent as  in former years by a continuouslydeclining exchange rate.    Chart. C compares our performance on payand productivity  in manufacturing with that of other countries. Ifour productivity was  up to French or German standards,  we could havegetting on for twice the output from our existing labour force.As the decline in our ability to compete has gone on for a number: years,   its causes are plainly deep-seated.    We cannot thereforeexpect a speedy recovery from our industrial problems.Britain,   like other countries,  has  reacted to rising inflationby taking measures to  limit the growth of total money expenditure;and to reduce inflationary expectations by persuading people to acceptand adapt to the  lower growth of money,  especially in wage demands.This has included setting targets for the growth of the money supply.The effect is similar to establishing a cash limit for the whole economy,within which cash  limits for the public sector are a natural consequence.The object must be to reduce from year to year the rate at which thesecash limits grow until  inflation  is under control.    Within that frameworkthe total increases will be divided into the part taken by inflationand the part that represents real growth of output.    Our task must,course,  be to reduce the former and increase the latter.2 r
CONFIDENTIALInflation10. Control of inflation,  which was the first task in our Manifesto,must then remain first:-- Because,   if not controlled,   inflation tends to accelerateand lead to an economic &quot;stop&quot;.- Because the attitudes which go with high  inflation alsoproduce poor productivity,  poor management and loss ofcompetitiveness,  so reducing growth and employment.- Because inflation  is unjust and unpopular.- Because our success or failure  in reducing it is one of themain things by which we shall be -judged.11. Inflation was accelerating when we came in.    We have reversedthat trend.     Inflation  is now about  12 per cent,  compared with about22 per cent a year ago.12. As  Chart ? shows,   in the past year inflation has fallen much morequickly  in Britain than  in the rest of the OECD.    And productivityhas  improved in some industries. But- Our inflation  is still above the OECD average and far too high.- We must bring down our costs substantially,  to help reverseour loss of competitiveness.- The progress so far made will be hard to maintain.13. This  last point is important.    Although most projections showinflation continuing to fall,  there is a real  risk of some temporaryreversal,  even  if,  by firm control of the money supply,  we can preventthis from going too far.    This could corne about because of such factorsas : -- A faster rise  in some world prices,  as activity recovers.- Pressures when our economy picks up,  as profit marginsrecover and employers bid for skilled labour.&quot;  The recent fall  in the exchange rate and the possibilityof further falls.- 3 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL14. Some of these factors are inevitably beyond our control. Soit is all the more important not to ease up on what we can do.    We musttake the expenditure and tax decisions that are necessary if we areto achieve our monetary targets and be in a position to help industry,for example on interest rates.    We need also to lighten the burdenof rates and taxes and to  improve incentives.15. In addition we must:-- take,all possible steps to secure a reduction in unit labourcosts and in the cost of the public sector;- maintain and strengthen expectations that inflation willcontinue to fall,  despite short term difficulties.-   4 rCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALOutput16. To repeat,  over the past 10 years prices have risen by 275 percent and money  incomes by 335 per cent,  but real output by only16 per cent.    Since the first half of 19 7 9 output has actuallyfallen by 5 to 6 per cent.17. In part this recent  fall in output reflects world-widedevelopments,  as most major economies experienced recession followingthe oil price rises.    Output  in all the major countries of theEuro.pean Community,   for example,  has fallen during the past year andis expected to remain roughly flat for the rest of the year.18. But the recession has been deeper in Britain, reflecting:-- The underlying weakness of our economy,  much of it over-mannedand uncompetitive.- Excessive pay increases over many years.- An tmcomfortable side-effect of North Sea oil,  through theimpact  of the  high  exchange  rate on some manufacturing industry.- The need to bring down inflation by more than other countrieshave had to do.19. Chart E shows that real industrial profitability has fallen fromabout 14 per cent to virtually nil in the past 20 years.    The rate ofnew investment  (after allowing for the replacement of old plant) hasalso fallen.     Chart F shows the contrast  in recent years betweenfalling company incomes -  down by 25 per cent  - and rising personalincomes -  up by  18 per cent.20. There are signs that,  with the rundown  in stocks coming to anend,  and retail sales high so far this year,  we are nearing the endof the  recession;    a number of recent indicators suggest that thefall in output is  levelling off and that in some industries activityis increasing.    There are encouraging reports of improved productivityRecent CBI and other reports offer evidence of some  improvement inbusiness confidence.&gt;;5 ;CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL21. But as with our success on inflation the improvement  here isfragile.    If we are to have the basis  for sustainable growth we mustresist any temptation to relax.    The world economic setting isunfriendly and intensely competitive.22. In this difficult setting,   any upturn  in the economic cyclewill take us only a small part of the way.    Essentially it will beup to business and industry to create or win new markets and toincrease market share,  at home as well as abroad.    Government musthelp and not hinder this process.    We still  need much wider under-standing,  above all in the public sector where several effectivelabour monopolies exist,  of the  importance of combined effort inpurusit of better productivity.    There are still too many obstaclesto economic change and flexibility,  probably above all  in thelabour market.    But not only there.- 6 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEmployment23. Chart G shows the recent very sharp rise  in unemployment,following a  long upward trend.24. Most of the actions required to improve productivity andcompetitiveness  -  cost cutting,  removal of restrictive practices,increasing efficiency -  necessarily increase unemployment at first.We face the consequences of years of over-manning.     In the  longer runimproving productivity and so competitiveness  leads to faster growthand more jobs.     That is the clear lesson of,  for example, theJapanese experience.    It is  in fact confirmed by the record of somesuccessful parts of the British economy.    The need is to bring ouraverage performance nearer to what our most successful firms andindustries have shown to be possible and at the same time to promotethe expansion of real and sustainable new employment opportunities.25. Nevertheless,  we must recognise that,  because of the bigimprovements  needed in our competitiveness and of a growing labourforce,   unemployment  is  likely to continue to rise for some time yet,although at a slower pace.    It -will take a  long time for businessand industry to develop, and exploit new markets on a sufficient scale.26. There is another point.    As Chart G shows,   recorded unemploymenthas for some years been increasing out of line with other indicatorsof the pressure of demand for labour.    Chart G also shows  how overtime each cyclical peak of unemployment is higher than the last.This  implies that even when the economy recovers and the demand forlabour improves,   unemployment  is quite  likely to stabilise at ahigher level than  in earlier decades.    We need to do all we can,without provoking renewed inflation,  to speed the sustainableexpansion of productive activity and real output.    But we must alsoseek ways of containing unemployment meanwhile.27. We need to consider the needs of particular groups, such as theyoung. But any such action cannot be allowed to jeopardise the needto control total public expenditure. Once again we see the need formore flexibility within the labour market. The higher the cost andthe greater the difficulty of taking on new labour, the smaller willbe the number of new jobs.- 7 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTax and public expenditure28.    So far in our period of office the tax and public expenditureburdens  have both risen,  as Chart H shows.      We have reduced thePSBR as a proportion of GDP  - but only by covering higher publicexpenditure by even higher taxes.29.    Within the  limits of the very tight fiscal situation we havebeen facing,  we have made significant improvements in the tax systemso as to encourage growth and enterprise:    thus we have dramaticallyreduced the confiscatory top rates of income tax,  and we have intro-duced an array of new incentives to promote the establishment andgrowth of small businesses.      But nonetheless the tax burden has sharplyincreased since 1978-79:-Although some switch has been made from taxes on personalincome to taxes on expenditure,  both direct and indirecttaxes are heavier than when we came to power, Excludingthe effects of the North Sea,  this year taxes (includingNational Insurance and rates)  will take 39^  per cent ofthe nation&apos;s income compared with 35 per cent in Labour&apos;slast year.A married man on average earnings now pays 48|  per cent ofhis income in direct and indirect taxes and contributionscompared with 45j  per cent when we came to office.We have made only moderate progress in easing capital taxesand in  lightening company taxation.Moreover,  on the projections published at Budget time  (based on ourplans for declining public expenditure,  as set out in the White Paper)the tax burden  in  1983-84 would still be 38 per cent of GDP  - 3 pointsabove the  level we inherited.30.    This falls well short of what  is expected of us by our supportersand indeed by the country as a whole.      For economic as well aspolitical  reasons we have to do better,Jl*    On public expenditure we set out to reduce the total substantiallyas a proportion of GDP.      Business and  industry still rightly regard,- 8 -m__CONFIDENTIAL_
CONFIDENTIALthis as an essential objective.      We have had some success.      We heldthe ratio steady for our first year in office.      Expenditure duringthe current year is expected to be  5 billion  less than ourpredecessors were planning,  despite the additional costs ofunemployment benefit and employment support due to the recession, forwhich their plans  included no provision.      For next year,  our Marchplans represent expenditure nearly  10 billion less than they wereplanning.      In achieving these reductions from previously plannedlevels,  we have not shrunk from some very difficult decisions. But:--   .In  1980-81 the total as a proportion of GDP shot up -both because GDP fell and because expenditure was higherthan we intended  (less than half of this excess can be&quot;  explained by the fact that the recession was worse thanexpected).This year the ratio could approach the peak reached in theearly years of the  last Labour Government.      In cash termsexpenditure by central and local government  in  1981-82 isestimated to be about  6 billion higher than forecast ayear ago.This represents an increase of more than 60 per centbetween  1978-19 and  1981-82,  compared with an increase inretail prices of 49 per cent.32.    Public expenditure must be paid for by the private sector, eitherthrough taxes or through the high interest rates that accompanyhigher borrowing.      To improve the outlook for the private sector wehave to reverse the growth of the public sector.      Charts I and 3show the present breakdown of spending.      They demonstrate theprogrammes we shall have to  look to for this.      And because we wantto do this without adding to inflation,  the apparently easy optionof further increasing public sector,  particularly nationalisedindustry,  prices beyond the levels currently envisaged  is not opento us.33.    We have already recognised,  and said publicly in the last PublicExpenditure White Paper,  that the present expenditure programmes arehigher than we wish in relation to financial and economic objectives.
. CONFIDENTIALNothing has happened to invalidate that judgement,      The need isclear to reduce the puhlic expenditure totals for the years aheadbelow the equivalent of those in the  last White Paper,34. Yet there are already pressures for increases, in certainprogrammes,   notably for nationalised industries  (relatively littlefor investment),  for industry generally,  for unemployment relatedprogrammes,  and for defence.35. There is a case for changing the composition of our spendingprogrammes to create room for public sector investment which gives agood return and which would also improve the relative prospects forprivate sector output and employment.      Within the total  increase of60 per cent  in public expenditure between  1979-80 and 1981-82, fixedinvestment was static in cash terms.      We should certainly do all wecan to ensure that the public investments we undertake are thosewhich will contribute most to making the economy more productive andcompetitive.      The best way to finance profitable public investmentis to cut out unprofitable public investment.36. We could go further and  increase public investment at the costof current expenditure.      But to the extent that we Increase publicexpenditure on investment  (or indeed increase any other programme) wehave to forego the chances of lower taxes or lower interest rateswhich might otherwise result from cuts in other programmes. (Thisis discussed at more  length  in the note attached at Annex B.) Thereare already signs of a repetition of last year,  with difficultreductions being required simply to hold the total against increaseswhich we may find unavoidable,   let alone to reduce it as we need.37. As well as reducing the size of the public sector we must makeevery effort to contain costs.      This year pay in the public services -but not  in the nationalised industries  -  is in general rising lessrapidly than pay in the private sector.      We need to do better still -especially in the nationalised industries  - and at  least to ensurethat we hold the improvements so far made./ -  10 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL38.    To repeat,  on present spending plans,  even on optimisticassumptions about the growth of the economy,  we shall enter theelection with an overall tax burden much heavier than the one weinherited,      Not only politically,  but also economically, thatis not tolerable.-  11 -CONFIDENTIAL
The way ahead39. Recovery  is  bound to be slow,  unemployment will go on rising forsome time yet -  although more slowly - and the fight against inflationwill grow harder,  particularly since we may no  longer have thebenefit of an appreciating exchange rate.    A sustained expansion ofoutput and jobs will only be possible if we maintain progress againstthe deep-seated weaknesses of the economy - poor productivity andcompetitiveness,  resistance to difficult changes,  a  large publicsector and,  perhaps above all, monopolistic and selfishly usedpower in pay bargaining.40. What the Government can do directly is  limited.     It  is a jobfor everyone.  Government,  management,  unions and  individuals. Butwe must go further towards creating the right climate for bringingabout the needed changes.    The need for perseverance over a relativelyprotracted period poses a formidable political problem.41. What should we be doing?    There are plenty of blind alleys.Thus : -Relax our money stance?    An inappropriate cut in interestrates would  lead to excessive monetary growth and evenmore inflation,  and any effects on unemployment would besmall and short-lived.    And it would worsen the long-termproblem of securing a proper balance between output andinflation.Formal  incomes policy?    We certainly need to ensure thatthe rate of growth of money incomes continues to fall.But experience shows that any success achieved by  forma 1  control  is always short-lived and counter-productivewhen its distorting effects unwind.Import controls?    For a major trading nation likeBritain retaliation would be inevitable,  and anyshort-run benefits to output and employment wouldbe purchased at the expense of efficiency and so ofconsumers and  of higher inflation.Bring down the exchange rate?    It has recently movedsharply down against the dollar,  but remains muchhigher against the D-mark than when we came into office.-, 12 -CONFIDENTIAL
Although it will help sales of UK exports  in the US,the recent movement  is bound to cause some anxietyabout the effect of .higher.import prices on inflation.Putting North Sea revenues to  &quot;better&quot; use?    A NorthSea Oil Fund perhaps?    But North Sea revenues, whichby 1983-84 are expected to amount to only about 6 percent of general Government revenues  (about half of annual defence spending and  less than we are alreadyspending on investment by publicly owned industries). are already helping to keep down the PSBR,  and sointerest rates.    And in any individual yearuncertainties over output  levels,  oil prices and theexchange rate affect actual receipts.    Any newaccounting device would at best be cosmetic and, giventhe uncertainties,  could  constrain our freedom ofaction.A straight  increase in public expenditure?    In orderto prevent this  leading to higher inflation,   it wouldentail higher taxes or higher interest rates, neitherof which would help the recovery of the privatesector.    This would be so even  if  the extra publicspending took the form of capital investment. Theeffect would be to discourage private spending,including  investment.    Yet  in the  long run privatesector investment decisions would almost certainlycreate more wealth than extra public spending.42. Clearly we must avoid the mistakes of  the past and be willingto sustain the right policies for long enough to secure a lastingimprovement in underlying performance.    This certainly meansmaintaining firm control  on the amount of money available in theeconomy,  the national cash  limit.    By making clear our determinationto stick to this discipline we can sustain the change  in expectationsand attitudes within industry.    There are encouraging signs. Butwe need to build on them and not risk dissipating them.43. To repeat,  the vital need,   in economic terms,   is to go onreducing the share of the rising national cash  limit that isabsorbed by  inflation and to increase the share that represents- 13 -&apos;CONFIDENTIAL
real growth of output. I set out below some of the difficult areaswhere we need to concentrate our thinking.Changing the patterns of economic behaviour(a) How can we secure much wider understanding of thescale of our problems and of their real causes?(b) What more can we do to convince people of the need -and of our determination -  to maintain the fightagainst inflation,  if unemployment is to begin toyield?    And to secure a sustained change in theattitudes of pay bargainers,   in public and privatesectors alike?(c) In particular,  what more can we do to create theclimate for a moderate rate of pay increases, welldown in single figures,   especially in the publicsector,   in the coming autumn and winter?Improving the supply side of the economy(d) How should we continue  increasing and improvingopportunities for the private sector and,  most ofall,  for new and expanding businesses?(e) What more should be done to remove obstacles tomobility and efficiency,  for example in thehousing market and  in the  labour market?If) How do we handle the prospect of a continuedgrowth in unemployment, particularly amongstthe young?Cg)    Should we be doing more to tackle monopolies andrestrictive practices,  whether in private or stateindustry or in the  labour market?    In particular,what more could we contemplate doing to tackle theproblems of union power and union behaviour?The balance of fiscal policy(h)    How do we make faster progress in reducing the size -and      cost -  of the public sector and so ensuringfurther progress towards  lower interest rates andreducing the tax burden on the private sector?r 14 ^CONFIDENTIAL
(i)    How much  importance do we attach to securingsignificant cuts  in the present tax burden?And how important are other commitments if weare to make room for tax cuts?44.    These are difficult questions for difficult times. Popularexpectations remain high and people are  (understandably) impatientfor success.    Yet we can restore the economy to health only if weare determined,  for some time to come,  to sustain the policiesneeded to achieve a fundamental change in attitudes and institutionsr    15 rCONFIDENTIAL.

It is plotted in the chart with the scale inverted so that itcan be more readily compared with movements in unemployment.As paragraph 29 says the tax burden is calculated excluding the effectsof the North Sea.     More specifically, it embraces all taxes (includinglocal rates) and contributions except taxes on North Sea operations, andis expressed as a percentage of GDP excluding the contribution of NorthSea oil and gas.     The &quot;national income&quot; denominator for the tax burdenthus differs from that used for calculating the ratio of public expenditureto GDP.     For this reason the absolute levels of the two lines in thechart are not directly comparable.     The chart is designed to bring outthe movements of the tax burden and public expenditure over time.Total expenditure in this chart relates to general government (i.e. centraland local government) and is divided into the main economic categories.Total expenditure on goods and services comprises the three right handsegments.     &quot;Lending to nationalised industries etc&quot; is lending by generalgovernment only;   it excludes public corporations&apos; direct borrowing fromthe market and overseas. ,

CONFIDENTIALANNEX BCAPITAL AND CURRENT EXPENDITUREThere is a wide-spread feeling at present that capital expenditurein the public sector should be increased. This note examines someof the issues briefly.2.      First,  some facts.    The plans we published last March showthat the dramatic shift between capital and current spending occurredbetween  1975-76 and  1978-79,  when public capital spending (includingGovernment  loans to nationalised industries)  fell by over one-third - 6 billion in  1980 Survey prices - while current spending rose - byover  3 billion.    Between  1978-79 and 1980-81 capital expenditurewill have fallen by a further  lj  billion,  while current spendingincreases by a further  3 billion.3. It should be noted that some of this reduction has reflecteda decline in needs.    For example,  there is now less need for amajor road building programme than there was in the  late 1960s and70s,  so capital spending on Motorways has fallen from its previoushigh  level.     (In fact,  the need at present is to maintain theMotorways  in good order,  and this falls on current expenditure ratherthan capital.)    Similarly,  a decline in the numbers of schoolchildren has reduced the need for new school buildings.4. So far as nationalised industries go,  where pressure foradditional capital spending is greatest,  the position is that from1977-78 to  1980-81 capital.expenditure has been broadly maintainedin real terms at about   4|  billion per year;    and this  is alreadyexpected to rise to about   5.2 billion for each of the years  up to1983-84.    This is a level for investment  last attained in 1976-77.This is all  in marked contrast to the fall which has taken place,and may continue to take place,   in private sector investment.5&gt;      It is widely assumed that capital expenditure  is good becauseit builds up the long term productive capacity for the economy, whereascurrent expenditure  is wasteful and does not do so.    This is not-  1 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALalways the case,  because the categorisation of expenditure as capitalor current  is  not of course made on that basis.6. Not all capital expenditure produces a long term economicbenefit,  and some current expenditure does.    Research and developmentand industrial training,   for example,  are generally classified ascurrent expenditure but ought to be adding to the nation&apos;s productivecapacity.    Investment  in prisons and unemployment benefit offices,on the other hand,   however beneficial or necessary they may be onother grounds,   can hardly be regarded as adding to the nation&apos;sproductive capacity.    Over simplified application of commercialaccounting principles can mislead in the case of public spending.7. Moreover,   even in the case of capital investment whichundoubtedly adds to productive capacity,  its desirability, comparedwith alternative uses of the resources  involved,  must obviously dependon the quality of the  investment.    Public  investment is only worthundertaking if it yields a satisfactory return.    At present thetest which is  applied to nationalised industry investment is whether   it willenable the spending programme in question overall to yield 5 per centin real terms.    Worthwhile projects have to be identified.    But historyshows how difficult this  is.    There are numerous examples ofunprofitable,  misguided or wasteful public sector investment projectssuch as the Isle of Grain power station and British Steel&apos;s investmentprogramme of the early  1970&apos;s.    The return on nationalised industryinvestment since 1972 in the aggregate has been very poor - neversignificantly above zero -  and well below that of the private sector.8. The difficulties that arise are,   in part at  least,  a reflectionof the fact that the process by which the market appraises a privatesector invitation to investors  is trusted,  but the process by whichgovernment appraises a nationalised industries application for fundsfor capital investment  is  less clear cut,  dependent on administrativediscretion,  and therefore  less acceptable.9- Indeed, even the 5 per cent test applied in the public sectoris not really comparable to the market test faced by investment inthe private sector.    Some nationalised  industries can produce any given-  2 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrate of return by the exercise of monopoly powers,   regardless ofwhether the project genuinely  increases efficiency.     In other casesthe rate of return is met by reducing the cost of providing a servicewhich- already runs at a loss  (this is the meaning of the 11 per centclaim for electrification of rail,  for instance -  it would show an11 per cent return as compared with  investment in diesels).10. If investment proposals do pass appropriate tests,  the nextquestion  is how they should be financed.    If our central economicobjective is to defeat  inflation by controlling the growth of money,at any given time the total  level of money expenditure in the economymust be  limited.    This means that investment proposals can only befinanced at the expense of other expenditure.11. This  is true,  whether one.is speaking of public investment orprivate.     In the case of private investment proposals,  the generaleconomic climate within which they are put forward is of coursematerially  influenced by the Government&apos;s fiscal and monetary policies,but both the total  level of investment and its distribution betweenprojects are determined by the market.12. In the case of the nationalised industries,   if investment canonly be financed at the expense of other expenditure,  the way in whichthis can be done outside the governmental rationing system is forthe necessary funds  to be generated internally.    In other words,nationalised industries should primarily finance investment out oftheir trading surpluses - which may often only be attainable by takingquite radical steps,  such as substantial manpower reductions andsignificant cuts  in real  earnings  levels,  but not,  of course,unjustifiable price rises brought about through the exercise ofmonopoly power.13. But  in the case of public sector investment the competition forfunds is wholly distorted by the Government&apos;s own credit being behindthe borrowing,  quite apart from the existence  in many cases of monopolyPower.    Investors naturally  like the security of lending to publicsector bodies,  whether there is an explicit Government guarantee or not,- 3 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe power to borrow is in effect backed by the power to tax, andthis makes it radically different from private borrowing. Themore borrowing of this kind there is, within the monetary limitswe have set,  the more difficult or expensive it must be for theprivate sector to borrow.      Even if private investment is possibleinterest rates can be forced up and in that sense crowding outcan take place.      That is why the extent of public borrowing hashad to- be rationed by the Government,  just as it is  in otherWestern countries with both a public and a private sector. Theinvention of new methods of finance for the public sector doesnot alter this basic point.14.    The possibility of allowing nationalised industries to raisepart or all of this finance for capital projects direct from themarket has of course been carefully considered and finalconclusions on this question have not yet been reached and willbe taken in the light of the findings of the NEDC taskforce setup following the June Council under Treasury Chairmanship. Butit would only be worth doing if some genuine  link could be madebetween the performance and efficiency of the industry and thereturns on the bond - so that investors are able to put the samesort of pressures on to management as shareholders do in theprivate sector.      The effect of a direct relationship with themarkets,   including the issue of prospectuses,  could have a usefulimpact on performance in efficiency,  if this genuine link couldbe made.      Without the real prospect of savings through greaterefficiency the higher cost of private rather than Governmentfinance would not be justifiable.      Again the difficulties ofthe monopoly powers and protected competitive position of manyof the industries present themselvesj  but it may be that a limitedmove in this area would be possible.      This would not affect themain issue,  as it would not justify any increase in total expenditure.15,    The difficulties of determining the level,  distribution andfinancing of public investment all underline the conclusion thatwe have  long ago reached that,  whenever it  is at all attainable,by far the best course is privatisation.      But however vigorouslythat is pursued,  the problem of the distribution of capital andcurrent expenditure within a reduce public sector will remain.- 4 -
CONFIDENTIAL16. It may well be true that the present pattern of capital andcurrent expenditure within the public sector is not the best one.When total expenditure has to be cut,  it is often easier to cut thecapital,  both in Government and in nationalised industries.There may well be projects for capital expenditure in both theseareas which should be given some degree of preference.17. The best way to finance profitable public investment is tocut out unprofitable public investment,  or make offsettingreductions in current expenditure in the public sector whetherwithin Government or in the nationalised industries.    But ifadditional  investments adds to the totals,  either or both oftwo consequences must follow:-(i)    There must be more public sector borrowing and thushigher interest rates and less private investmentj or(ii)    taxes must be higher so as to reduce private consumption.H.M.
