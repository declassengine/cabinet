CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTR1C(81) 42 COPY NO27 July 1981CABINETPROPOSALS FOR HOUSING LEGISLATION - RENT DEREGULATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forIndustry, the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary ofState for Wales1. The Secretaries of State for the Environment and Wales have madeproposals for selective deregulation of private sector rents by area. Webelieve that these proposals would contribute to the availability of rentedaccommodation in the private sector and to labour mobility.    The Home andSocial Affairs Committee (H) have not been able to reach agreement on whetherthese proposals should be included in the Housing Bill planned for 1981-82, andhave referred the issue to Cabinet for decision.2. The private rented sector has declined from 35 per cent of all house-holds in 1961 to 14 per cent in 1977, and the trend continues apace. Landlordsare increasingly selling rather than reletting and lack of supply is drivinghouseholds to other tenures.    In view of the expenditure constraints in thepublic sector and the annual increase in net adult household formation expectedthroughout the 1980s, we consider it essential to create more opportunities torent in the private sector.    There are moreover direct implications for labourmobility, for which private renting has a quite disproportionate importance.About a third of movers who change jobs go into private rented accommodation,as do abou* a quarter of those moving with their employment.    With firmsincreasingly recruiting skilled labour from further afield, the sector isparticularly important for long-distance movers.    We need to avert its declineif the situation is not to be even worse when the recession ends and when aflexible labour force will be essential to revival of the economy.*  It is proposed that the Secretaries of State should be given a new powerto disapply the fair rent regime for new lettings only in areas specified by them.In the areas where the power was used, rents for new lettings would initially beagreed between landlord and tenant.    Subsequently, however, either landlord ortenant could apply at any time to the rent officer to fix a market rent. Thetenant would have full security of tenure (as do business tenants) but with theright to pass the tenancy to one successor only (eg spouse to widow(er) but notthen to a son too).    The deregulation power would be capable of use in respect1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof all dwellings in any area Jr for a particular class of dwelling (eg above acertain rateable value) in any area.    The initial intention however is to use itonly in non-metropolitan areas.    It would replace an existing power to lift fairrent regulation that was included in the original 1965 Labour Rent Act and isstill on the Statute Book but which on legal advice we consider is unusable inpractice.    This is because it requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied thatsupply and demand are in balaace in every part of the area he selects forderegulation and this would be wide open to challenge in the courts.4. Depending on the precise areas selected, market rents might be some50 per cent higher than fair rents.    It is not possible to quantify the effect thiswill have on supply of accommodation, but it can only be bei eficial.    It is clearthat the prime reason why landlords are disinvesting from the sector is the lowlevel of rental return.    The average fair rent paid in 1981 is expected to beabout  9. 50.    This is only 7.2 per cent of average male manual earnings, thelowest level since the introduction of fair rents and lower (for the first time)than the average local authority rent.    Our judgment is that most new tenantswould be quite prepared to pay market rents substantially above current fairrents.    Surveys show that very few tenants - including those paying well abovethe average rent - think their current rents too high, except at the very top ofthe market in London.    A practical demonstration that letting at market rentscan take place voluntarily on terms mutually acceptable to landlord and tenantwill do much to restore confidence in the viability of private renting, and thebenefits of deregulation will therefore go much wider than the immediateincrease in supply in the areas selected.5. The existence of a power to deregulate by area in Labour legislation willnot prevent our opponents mounting a scare campaign.    Some colleagues areconcerned that the resulting political controversy will outweigh any housingbenefit - especially as a Labour commitment to reimpose fair rents in thederegulated areas is predictable.    We believe that a robust defence can bemounted against scare-mongering as follows:i. No existing tenant would be affected in any way. They wouldcontinue to be subject to fair rents and have full security of tenure.ii. All new tenants in deregulated areas would have these importantprotections:a. Rent Act security of tenure for one generation (including awidow or widower).b. The right to apply to the independent rent officer service atany time to ensure that he was paying no more than a market rent.c. All the other safeguards under rent legislation, includingprotection from eviction and harassment and the right to rentallowance based on the actual rent paid.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALiii.     The purpose of deregulation is to make more rentedaccommodation available, for which there is a clear demandespecially among the young and mobile.    It will help firms to recruitthe skilled labour they need to survive and expand.Additionally we would make clear that as a matter of policy we do not intend touse the power in London, and other metropolitan areas.    The possibility wasraised in H Committee as to whether the deregulation power could itself becircumscribed so as to exclude London statutorily.6. On current evidence the private rented sector is about to drop beneath10 per cent of all households, with no sign of the decline abating.    It is ourjudgment that we need to begin to act now before further erosion takes place.We therefore ask colleagues:a. To agree that the proposal for deregulation by area should beincluded in the next Session&apos;s Housing Bill.b. To decide whether or not the power as contained in the primarylegislation should exclude London.G HK JM HN EDepartment of the Environment27 July 19813CONFIDENTIAL
