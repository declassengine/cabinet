CONFIDENTIALPUBLIC FJQ ENuITURENote by the Central Policy Review Staff1, The Chancellor&apos;s paper asks Cabinet to endorse the over-riding aimof getting public expenditure totals below those derived from the MarchWhite Paper.   This is to allow reductions in the tax burden. TreasuryMinisters will then discuss with colleagues bilaterally how programmescan contribute to the overall aim, and will make proposals in the Autumn,2. Cabinet on 17 June endorsed the objective of maintaining the presenteconomic strategy.   Within that framework, Ministers may find it useful tohave a brief note on the strategic public expenditure issues, even at thisstage in advance of the Autumn discussions.    Some of the issues cannot beresolved until then.(i)    Public expenditure and taxation.    The Chancellor argues the need toreduce the burden of taxation both as a political priority, and to improvesupply-side performance via incentives and company profits.   The comparisonof employment effects is difficult, e.g. because of market reactions (hisparagraph 8).   But the employment trade-off will depend heavily on theparticular tax and expenditure options being considered, and on the time-acale.Will Ministers need more information on the employment trade-off whenconsidering particular tax and expenditure options?(ll)   Public expenditure totals.   The attached table gives the figures agreedfor the last White Paper, in constant prices of late 1979.   They will be up-dated, and converted into cash, for discussion in the Autumn.   But the totalsshow that in these (volume) terms, the Government has not yet succeeded inreversing the upward trend of public spending.   Furthermore, only a small^crease of some 14- per cent would mean that the upward trend would continue1982/83.1.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL(III) Programmes.   The table shows the main programme totals. Theserepresent the outcome of past Ministerial decisions on priorities. Theyshow once again the large proportion of programmes protected by some foraof commitment - social security (28 per cent in 1982/83)i defence (13 percent on these figures, now higher), health (12 per cent), law and order(4 per cent).   Beyond these (well over half the total), there are tightconstraints on cutting back many other programmes - e.g. EEC,.agriculture,industry, employment, education.   Much of the rest is current spending by-local authorities, where there is the problem, of control.   In decidingwhether a reduction below the White Paper totals should be the over-riding aim, Ministers must in effect ask themselves:How in practice can they find further cuts in these programmes?(IV) Additional bids.   These are over  6bn. (cash) or 5 per cent of the total,The Treasury&apos;s aim implies either rejecting these or offsetting them by extracuts elsewhere.   But the additional bids are by no means all for optionalvolume additions.   They are of various kinds   as the Chancellor says :(i) Cash squeeze.   Under cash planning, any cash squeeze due tohigher prices or pay this year is carried forward into the base fornext year.   Perhaps  1 bn. (including      bn. for local authorities)more cash is needed now to buy the volume planned for 1982/83 inthe White Paper.(ii) Prices.   Nearly  1 bn, of bids is for expected pay and priceincreases higher than the average (provisionally 7 per cent).(iii) Nationalised Industries.   Bids for increased EFLs amount to 2 - bn. - mainly to offset the impact of recession.   If investmentis not to be cut, nor prices increased, reducing the bids requirescuts in current costs (i.e. greater efficiency).   In some industries,redundancy payments may make it impossible to do this at least in thefirst year.(iv) Local authorities.   If the Government cuts back on BSG,differentially or across the board, the main result will be higherrates.(v) Current vs. capital.   Ministers will want to hold back currentspending where possible to make room for productive capital investme^
CONFIDENTIALand other forms of &quot;spend to save&quot;.   The Chancellor&apos;s paper discussesa pay/capital trade-off.   Otherwise, central Government manpower isalready being squeezed.   Are there other forms of current spending(e.g. some social security payments) which could be held back?(vi)   Employment.   Ministers have asked for further work on the 1.4 bn. bid and other options.   A medium-term package which meetsthe Government&apos;s objectives will not be easy to find without addingsubstantially to present expenditure totals (even net).The question for Ministers is:Can the case for these additional bids be over-ridden in the interestsof achieving the tax objective?Conclusion3,      In summary, the question before Ministers is whether they are preparedto mount now a much more aggressive attack on current spending than theyhave found possible so far.   Otherwise the Government&apos;s taxation andpublic expenditure objective will not be achieved.   In the private sector,firms have had to find ways of meeting cash crises by drastic action tocut back, often by doing things they had previously regarded as unthinkable.Can the public sector be made to yield dramatic further cuts incurrent spending?20 July 19813CONFIDENTIAL
