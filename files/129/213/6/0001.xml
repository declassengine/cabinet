SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 3115 June 1981CABINETTHE DEFENCE PROGRAMMEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence1. I have carried out a major reappraisal of the defence programme.On 8 June the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee (OD) endorsed thebroad thrust of my proposals for reshaping it.2. The central assessment I put before OD is that we are at presenttrying to do too much, with the certainty of not doing it well enough. Nowis the time to face radical adjustment, and to settle a stable and realisticlong-run course.3. I need not recapitulate the facts of the Soviet military build-up, ofenormous scope in numbers and increasingly in quality also.    The UnitedStates under President Reagan is clearly determined upon renewed effort;but this can do little to affect the situation in the next few years.    At thesame time many of our European allies face sharp domestic politicaldifficulties over defence.    We can-iot count on consistent resolve from them.Great Britain has been a key bastion of freedom twice this century, and wecannot be wholly certain that the task will not fall to us again.    But thesurvival of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) remains vital tous, and we must be all the more wary of any action that might threaten itscohsffiorf in the years ahead.4. I estimate that to sustain our existing programme, conventional andnuclear, we would require at least  300 million a year above current NATOaims fcr a 3 per cent increase in real terms up to 1987-88.    Even then Icould not guarantee that rising equipment costs will not cause continuingand mounting difficulty.5. Unless we take hard political decisions now we shall be faced witha fudged compromise which sustains Service manpower and civilianemployment at the expense of realistic operational capability for the future,plus repeated re-runs of the past year&apos;s chaos in which short term cashsqueezes on a programme with no proper headroom led to indiscriminatefreezes on procurement, ships tied up in port, aircraft grounded, NATOexercise participation suddenly cancelled and stocks run down.    This wasour experience in 1980-81, and even with these expedients we overspentour cash limit, though we managed to hold the amount to  110 million.Similar difficulties are already indicated for 1981-82, as indicated inparagraph 12 below.1COPY NO Q,0 1SECRET
SECRET6. We must therefore restore greater stability to our long term planning,with seme margin for manoeuvre and for the unexpected.    We need moreflexibility between finarcial years, and a realistic assessment of defencecost movement against general inflation (the &quot;relative price effect&quot;) whencash limits are set.    We must also wring further substantial savings outof our overheads and support, for example in the Research and DevelopmentEstablishments and in staffs, and I am determined to achieve this. Butnone ot these things will meet the central problem.    We have to tacklebasic force structure;  all else flows from that.THE WAY AHEAD7. My view, endorsed by OD, on the balance between roles can besummarised thus.    Our nuclear role is unique within NATO Europe andoutstandingly cost-effective;  we must go on with it, and so with Trident.We must   sustain and where possible improve direct defence of the UnitedKingdom itself not least because it is the crucial reinforcement base forNATO.    We must also, in today&apos;s changing world, improve our flexibilityfor operatior s outside the NATO area (this need not mean great extraexpense).    Our land and air contribution in Germany is of high militaryimportance to NATO;  moreover, any major cut in it would be hugely dis-ruptive politically at a difficult and dangerous time.    We can make someadjustments at the margin, but we must stand by the Brussels Treatycommitment.    It is financially essential to alter the balance of our generalmaritime contribution.    We should enhance our submarine and maritimeair effort, but reduce the size and sophistication of the surface fleet (andthe dockyard structure which supports it).RESOURCES8  Resource allocation is cardinal, both politically and practically.Politically, I cannot hope to present the reshaping effectively - to the Party,in the country and with our key Allies - if our allocations are seen to breakaway from NATO&apos;s 3 per cent target.    Practically, I cannot sustain eventhe reduced force structure if the long term level is set too low;  and Icannot make the difficult transition to the new posture if the near-term levelis set too low.9. OD discussion of budget provision focussed on three options, twosuggested by me and one by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    The resourceimplications of these are set out in the columns of figures in Annex A. Myfirst option envisaged a firm move at brisk speed (substantially as describedin Annex B and its Appendices) to the new posture.    For this I would need3 per cent real annual growth assured to 1985-86, but would plan thereafteron only 1 per cent.    I should however need, for political reasons, to havespecial extra funding up to 1985-86 to meet Trident&apos;s early costs. Mysecond option would envisage a slower move to the new posture (though withunchanged long term goals) if my colleagues felt that the faster transitionwith the full consequences in the appendices to Annex B posed intolerablepolitical problems.    For this I would need 3 per cent growth to 1987-882SECRET
SECRETwith 1 per cent thereafter, but given the political easement I could forgothe Trident supplement.    The figures for the first option are in Column 1and for the second in Column II ol Annex A herewith.10. The Chancellor proposed a third option:   3 per cent real growth in1982-83 and 1983-84 (as we have already announced and confirmed) but nogrowth at all thereafter.    The resulting figures are in Column III ofAnnex A.    I recognise the concerns underlying this proposal;  but itsadoption would destroy the whole concept.    Politically it would bedisastrous, at home and abroad;  practically, it would compel evensharper structural cuts and many particular measures even more painfulin domestic, terms than those already envisaged.    It would give uspolitically the worst of both worlds - inescapably, do economic relief topublic expenditure in the life of this Parliament, yet major Alliance,military, industrial and employment penalties rapidly apparent.    I alsojudge that it would create intolerable strains in the Conservative Party.11. I recommend - as I believe was the preference in OD - my ownsecond option (Column II of Annex A).    I would present the new programmepublicly in as positively a manner as possible - provided it is underpinnedby the absolutely crucial 3 per cent decisions, there are numerousattractive features we can stress and I would do what I could in the finalworking out of details to soften some sharp edges.    But Cabinet shouldrecognise   that even at the slower pace of change   there will remain manyunpalatable measures, notably these:-a. The dockyards at Chatham and Gibraltar would close,,Portsmouth would be very severely contracted.    Numerous otherNaval shore establishments would close.b. There would be a substantial reduction in the surface fleetthrough the 1980s, with older ships disposed of rather thanmodernised.    The number of destroyers/frigates would dropfrom 59 now to about 45 in 1986 and about 40 thereafter beforerising again to about 45 by 1990 (the precise longer term numberwould depend in part on how quickly new cheaper ships could bebrought in).    We would operate only two of the three new carriers,and would seek to sell the third.c. Royal Navy numbers would drop from 68, 000 now to about57, 000 in 1986, and Army numbers from 142, 000 now to 135, 000(with uni*; disbandments) in 1986.    Redundancies of some 2, 300in the Royal Navy by 1986 (with perhaps a further 1, 700 later)and up to 3, 000 in the Army seem inevitable, and recruitingwould have to be held back in all three Services.d. Ministry of Defence civilians might be reduced by about afurther 20, 000 over and above the large reduction (nearly 50, 000)to which we are already committed;  there would be manyredundancies.3SECRET
SECRETe.       Job opportunities in industry might be reduced by 20, 000or more, mainly in labour-intensive areas like shipbuilding.12. There is also a short term resource problem (see paragraph 5above).    I must warn the Cabinet that we seem likely to face greatdifficulties this year, where initial forecasts suggest a possible cash over-spend as high as  500 million, mainly on the equipment programme. Thefall in the value of the pound against the dollar is adding to our problems.We shall have to take firm and early steps, notably by moving to impose cashrationing on industry, which will be highly unpopular and highly damaging toemployment in the industrial sector.    I regard it as politically essential toannounce these steps in my statement on the programme.    I must look to afair and realistic review of this year&apos;s cash limit since otherwise we shouldneed to take steps so drastic as to undermine the entire thrust of our plans.I am pursuing this urgently with, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.NEXT STEPS13. We must move ahead fast now.    I propose to explain our planspersonally to my United States and Federal Republic of Germany counter-parts and to the Secretary General of NATO in the early part of next week,and then to announce them publicly, if all goes well, on Thursday 25 June.I envisage making a statement in Parliament, backed by a supportingdocument.DECISIONS NEEDED14. I invite Cabinet:a*       to confirm OD&apos;s endorsement of the broad thrust of myproposals (paragraph 7 above);b.       to choose between the first and second resource optionsand reject the third (paragraphs 8-11);c-       to agree that their decision on resource volume at b.should be translated into cash terms on realistic assessmentsof defence prices;d.       to note that I may also have to announce the imposition ofcash rationing on industry to curb this year&apos;s programme, andthat there must be a fair review of this year&apos;s cash limit(paragraph 12).J NMinistry of Defence15 June 19814SECRET

ANNEX BTHE DEFENCE PROGRAMME1. The defence programme needs to be revised, for two reasons.Firstly, the latest Ministry of Defence Long Term Costing(LTC 81) has confirmed that even if the current programme wereideal in relation to the growing threat,  it is overfull by anyreasonable standard of what we can sustain.    The force structureis too large for the means likely to be available. Secondly,the rapid advance of military technology, exploited bymassive Soviet spending, calls for change in our priorities.2. The Government has already decided upon a successor systemin the strategic nuclear deterrent role, and upon revivedemphasis upon capability for out-of-area operations; and theneed for better defence of our home base is plain.    Any re-shapingof the programme must focus critically upon the two other majorcomponents of our current posture - our general maritimecapabilities and our land/air capabilities on the Central Front.Even if the only problems defence faced were economic ones, ageneral dilution of quality or of quantity would not be tolerable.Equally,  the financial problems cannot be solved simply bycutting out &quot;waste&quot;; in a Defence Budget of  12 billion theremust always be scope for better value for money, but it is notpossible to achieve an adequate match between the current forcestructure and likely resources in this way alone; change must betackled at a deeper level.An- 1SECRET
SECRET3. It is important however to recognise that the need forchange is not only or mainly a matter of mismatch betweenprogramme and resources.    There is a strong case forchange, especially as technological development affects thevulnerability of present systems.    Present investment plans forequipment are unbalanced; too much is envisaged for costlyweapons platforms (ships, aircraft, tanks) and not enough onmodern weapons themselves to give the most effective strikingpower.    A shift in the latter direction will improve realdeterrence.4. All these factors - operational, technical and financial -have played a part in a radical re-appraisal of the forwardprogramme.Basic Approach5. Work was commissioned on the basis, for study, of a deliber-ately severe reduction in resource assumptions.    Shaping a long-term defence programme raises an acute problem of uncertainty,since very large elements have to be committed ten years or morein advance - much further ahead than the precise defence budgetcan be forecast.    But it makes no sense to pitch our planned forcestructure at the limits of what could be supported on the mostoptimistic projection.    A basic structure needs to be set at alevel which could - indeed must - be sustained through theinevitable shifts as budget allocations move from projection tospecific decision in cash terms.An- 2SECRET
6. The basic structure must of course be accompanied by properprovision for logistic support, training, mobility and the like,since without these the forces will not have the readiness,staying power and standards of operational performance needed.These cannot safely be neglected.    And recurrent arbitraryshort-term measures like those which had to be taken last yearas a result of cash problems - ships kept in harbour, aircraftgrounded and so on - must be avoided7. The nuclear role is cardinal, and Trident must go on.It looks probable that it will be wise to switch to the TridentII system (which would be likely to slow down expenditure inthe next few years although costing more overall).    This isbeing explored non-committally with the Pentagon.    A furtherreport will be made separately in due course.8. Direct defence of the UK base should not be cut; ifanything more ought to be done.    Some more Hawk trainersshould be armed as supplementary fighters.    There would beattractions in bringing Phantom interceptors home from Germany,but this is not straightforward.    The size and role of thereserve forces, especially the Territorial Army, should beexpanded.An - 3SECRET
SECRET9. As regards the Central Front, it would make a lot of sensein purely UK military terms to have a slimmer BAOR of perhaps45,000, structured around two strong armoured divisions as amanoeuvre reserve for the Northern sector of the Central Regiowith someone else taking over the forward frontage for which theUnited Kingdom is responsible; but the military and politicaldifficulties in the Alliance would be formidable.    If thesedifficulties mean sticking to the current role and the BrusselsTreaty figure, it would be necessary to keep very tightly to anestablishment of 55,000 (organised around three armoured divisionsrather than four, to  save   overheads), and also to draw on BAORmore readily than hitherto customary, Northern Ireland aside, forcontingencies elsewhere.    On either option, if the Army is to bereasonably equipped its total manpower must be cut and from fiveto ten major units disbanded.    An enlarged TA would make thisslightly easier.10. Bigger savings in the land/air field could be made only bycutting BAOR much more sharply, with still more major unitsdisbanded and a still smaller Army left for all the varied callsmade on it at home and abroad; and by taking more squadrons outof the Royal Air Force&apos;s front line.    The NATO consequences wouldbe very grave.11. Substantial changes are inevitable in the structure of ourgeneral maritime contribution, though these will not be free frommilitary and political difficulti es in the Alliance.    The topAn- 4SECRET
SECRET-quality maritime effort, after the strategic deterrent and itsprotection, would be concentrated upon submarines and maritimeair.    There would be a smaller surface fleet, with fewer high-cost new ships, for peacetime and for periods of tension andgeneral deterrence.       This   would   imply beingengaged   in high-intensity operations against Soviet oppositiononly in circumstances where the US could provide the mostsophisticated elements, for example in organic maritime airdefence.    It would be important however to exploit vigorouslythe flexibility of the surface fleet for deployment outside theNATO area.12. Within a modified programme it will be all the more importantto shed the Belize stationing task.    In Gibraltar the dockyardwould close and the airfield be transferred to civil running;further savings might be considered if Spain joins NATO. Thereshould be a hard look at Cyprus, though the political difficultiesprevent assuming large savings at present.   Modest measures, asalready identified, to improve the general out-of-area flexibilityof UK ground forces should proceed.13. Appendices A-C set out the main features of revised basicstructures for each of the Service programmes, with alternativesfor BAOR as indicated in paragraph 9 above.    Appendices D-Fcompare &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; front lines; Appendix G lists themain specific decisions which would need to be faced this year;An- 5SECRET
SECRETAppendix H shows the effect on major equipment projects; andAppendix I notes some of the locations in the UK where effectswould be particularly felt.    All these Appendices at presentoffer broad indications; a good deal of adjustment is bound tobe needed as particular elements are further developed andscrutinised in the processes of detailed programme planning.Industry and Employment14. In total an increasing real amount would still be spent ondefence equipment.    Some particular expectations would, however,be disappointed, and partly through a shift away from certainlabour-intensive areas (most notably surface shipbuilding),partly through increased productivity and partly because ofoverseas purchases the estimated number of jobs directly sustainedin British industry would fall by about 20,000-30,000 from thepresent 235,000.    The drop would be less if defence sales increased.15. Specific features would include these:a. The vast majority of major future equipmentprojects would remain, as  Appendix I shows.b. In particular, the UK would proceed with AV8B(the UK/US improved Harrier purchase) and Sea Eagle(British Aerospace&apos;s air-launched anti-ship missile),but plans for a trilateral combat aircraft would beabandoned.    The British design capability for such combataircraft could not easily be preserved.An-6SECRET
SECRETc. Warship building would be hard hit, andsome yards would have to close.d. British Aerospace, Ferranti and Marconiwould lose prospective work in maritime guidedweapons and electronics.e. Employment at Short&apos;s would suffer.f. There seems no way of affording the Marconiheavyweight torpedo if the cost advantage of theUS alternative proves anything like the  400M nowsuggested; but a UK/US bargain on torpedoes,possibly involving elements of our Stingray light-weight torpedo, would be sought.g. The maritime helicopter to replace Sea Kingis a problem.    The concept&apos;s place in the newprogramme is not firmly established and the cost ishigh.    Given its importance to Westlands and thecivil commercial prospects claimed, it may bedesirable to sustain work into 1982 pending finaldecisions; but its long-term future must be amatter mainly for the Department of Industry andthe market.16.    Defence employment would be hit in other areas also.Re-shaping the whole support base would be a complex affair andAn -7SECRET
SECRETit is impossible to identify all the details now; but likelychanges would include these:a. As Appendix I illustrates, Gibraltar, Chathamand most of Portsmouth dockyards would close, aswell as various other depots and installations.b. The in-house R&amp;D base would be cut, reducingthe number of establishments.c. Training courses and establishments and othersupport would be pruned rigorously.d. Including transfers from the public to the privatesector (where, for example, as much as possible wouldbe done in relation to the Royal Ordnance Factories)the number of MOD-employed UK-based civilians -already cut from 248,000 in 1979 to 231,000 now, anddue to be 200,000 in 1984 - might come down eventuallyby about a further 20,000.e. Service recruitment would in most categorieshave to be sharply restrained.f. It would be impossible to avoid redundancies,both in the Services (where officer numbers,especially in staff and support posts, would reducesubstantially) and among civilian employees; theAn- 8SECRET
SECRETtotal redundancy in the Royal Navy would probablyrun to 6,000-7,000.    All these would affectnear-term costs.An - 9SECRET
SECRETAPPENDIX AROYAL NAVYThe Royal Navy&apos;s top priority task would remain the provisionof the UK strategic nuclear force, initially with the present foursubmarines (SSBNs) equipped with CHEVALINE-improved Polaris andeventually, by the middle 1990s, with the new TRIDENT force. Othernaval units (eg minesweepers, submarines, and ASW frigates andhelicopters) would continue to contribute as appropriate to protectingthe deployment of the strategic force.2. For general maritime warfare the Royal Navy would concentratefirst upon the provision of a powerful submarine force to exploitour position on the flank of the Soviet Navy&apos;s main exit to theAtlantic.    Our number of submarines (SSBNs apart) would fall from28 now to 25 in 1991, but within the total the nuclear-powered boatswould increase from 12 to 17 and some new diesel-powered boats would bebuilt.    An advanced new heavyweight torpedo would be provided, by meansof purchase from the US (if possible in some deal involving elementsof our own advanced lightweight anti-submarine torpedo STINGRAY).3. There would be a sharp contraction in the total size of thesuv-face fleet, though the proportion of newer ships would be highera     STINGRAY would go ahead.    The main changes would be these:a.     There would only be two of the new CVS(anti-submarine carrier) in service, and thethird would be disposed of abroad; and no moreSea Harriers would be bought.A - 1SECRET
SECRETb. The fleet of destroyers/frigates would be reducedfrom 59 now to 38 in 1986 and 36 in 1991 and reducefurther thereafter.    This would come about:(i) by undertaking no more mid-life modernisations; and(ii) by disposing earlier than planned of a considerablepart of the present fleet.    Six older destroyers (includingBRISTOL) and twenty-seven older frigates (of whichrespectively two and seventeen were due to be kept beyond1990) would be sold or scrapped, and three furtherfrigates would be placed in reserve.c. Early disposals would also include the ASW carrierHERMES and the amphibious assault ships FEARLESS and INTREPID.(This would bring forward to 1984 the date at which the RoyalMarines are to lose their specialist amphibious landingcapability.)   The Royal Marines themselves would continue atabout their present strength.4.     No more Type 42 (air-defence-optimised) ships would be ordered;planned improvements to their capability would be cut sharply; andthere would be no move to a new type in this role.    Only at most twomore of the Type 22 (anti-submarine-optimised) ships would be orderecand there would be a move to a smaller and simpler new ASW frigate, 1Type 23, which would be designed with an eye to sales overseas.A-2SECRET
5. The number of mine-counter-measure ships would riseslightly; that of fleet auxiliaries would be halved by 1991.The size of the hydrographic fleet would be halved and theice-patrol ship ENDURANCE phased out in 1982.6. The support organisation would need to be extensivelyreshaped to match the smaller surface fleet.    Gibraltar dockyardwould close by the end of 1982 and Chatham in 1984.    Most ofPortsmouth Dockyard would close by 1984.    Up to fourteen stores orother depots elsewhere in the UK would be closed (see Appendix I).7. Naval shore deployment and training capability would be sharplycut, with twelve fleet shore establishments eventually closed. Inall the Royal Navy&apos;s manpower establishment would reduce from69,000 now to 50,000 (entailing redundancies of about 1,500 officersand 5,000 ratings) by 1986, and to 47,000 by 1991.    Civilian manpowerwould reduce from 68,000 now to 48,500 by 1986.A - 3SECRET
APPENDIX BARMYThe Army would contract somewhat in total size, but themain elements of plans to improve its equipment would be maintained,with some modifications, and war stocks would be enhanced.There would be a substantial expansion in the Territorial Army.A major peacetime deployment in the FRG would be maintained in oneor other of two forms (paragraph 2 below).    Modest measures wouldgo ahead to improve flexibility for out-of-area operations.2. Two options for BAOR have been costed:-Option A.    Keep current task (the forward-defence of 65 kmfrontage).    Manpower to be held tightly to the BrusselsTreaty 55,000 (as compared with the present establishmentof 58,400).    Organisation to be three regular armoured divisions(from which one brigade would be held in UK) plus a UK-basedTerritorial Army division, instead of the current fourin-station regular armoured divisions of smaller size.Option B.    Give up forward-defence task and frontage,save for a &quot;token&quot; brigade group, and provide a BAOR of45,000 stationed troops centred on a strong armoured forceof two regular divisions as Northern Army Group reserve,plus a UK-based TA division.3. The total Regular Army trained establishment, now some42,300, would by 1988 be about 133,000 with Option A and&apos;29,000 with Option B.    Five major units would be disbanded intion A and ten in Option B.    Option B would be rather more expensivethan Option A in the 1980s because of the costs of change, butwould be up to  100M a year cheaper eventually.L-       The Territorial Army establishment would be increased fromt 2 present 74,000 to about 86,000 eventually.B-lSECRET
SECRET5.      One major Army equipment project (the Wave 11 data-handling system to help operational headquarters in 1 BritishCorps to deal rapidly with intelligence and other information)and some smaller projects would be abandoned.    Various plannedimprovement programmes would be slowed down or reduced. Thebuy of the new Challenger tank would be held at one division&apos;sworth.    There would be a substantial reduction in the buy ofthe new mechanised combat vehicle and many of the present FV432vehicles would be run on to the end of the century. ExtraMilan infantry anti-tank guided missiles would be bought(including more for the TA) and war stocks of most kinds ofammunition would be increased.B-2SECRET
APPENDIX CROYAL AIR FORCEThe size of the Royal Air Force would be substantiallymaintained.    There would be marked improvement in strike/attackcapability (Tornado with advanced weapons), in airborne earlywarning, and in certain other aspects of maritime air effort andof UK air defence.    Close air support capability would be improvedin quality, but plans to rectify the prospective lack of air combatcapability would be abandoned.2.     Overall, the RAF front line would decline from 649 aircraftto under 600 in 1983/84, and rise thereafter to 631 in 1986 and662 by 1991.    The Tornado programme (ncwdeeply committed, andmade very inflexible by the complex collaborative arrangements)would be kept, but the option would be held open of taking thelast 20 aircraft in the interceptor rather than the strike versionfor use in UK air defence.3.     An extra 36 Hawk trainers would be armed as supplementaryfighters for UK defence, but any replacement of the BloodhoundSAM system would be postponed well into the 1990s.   An examinationwould be carried out of bringing back the two Phantom squadronsfrom Germany for UK defence, putting Wildenrath airfield on careand maintenance but preserving the option of forward detachment.The last three Nimrod airframes would be brought into serviceln the maritime patrol role, and there would also be considerationuf converting to this role the three Nimrods currently used onspecial duties (for which other aircraft might be adapted). TheSea Eagle anti-ship missile programme would remain.    Buccaneers would^e run on in the maritime role, so relieving the (more expensive)T rnado front-line.C-lSECRET
SECRET5. The remaining Vulcans would be disbanded early, beforeTornado replaces them, and the start of the Jaguar run-down broughforward.    The direct Jaguar replacement (AST 403 - the TrilateralCombat Aircraft) would be abandoned and the lack of air combatcapability against future Soviet fighters accepted.    60 HarrierAV8Bs would be produced in collaboration with the US.   The JP233anti-airfield weapon project would continue and new weapons forsuppressing enemy air defences and for attack on armour would bebought.6. To save money, over the next three years flying hours inmost roles would be brought down close to the SHAPE minimum rate.7. VClOs would be converted for use as tankers or transportsand would progressively replace Victors in the former role.Replacement (eg by Jetstream) of present communications aircraftwould be postponed until the later 1980s.8. The RAF would cease to operate Gibraltar airfield.C-2SECRET
