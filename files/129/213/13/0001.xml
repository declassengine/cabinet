CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PP.OPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT8C(81) 38 COPY NO20 July 1981CABINETLOCAL AUTHORITIES&apos; CURRENT&apos; EXPENDITURE 1982-83Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paper C(81) 37 discusses ourgeneral approach to the Public Expenditure Survey.    This note is about animmediate decision concerning local authorities&apos; spending plans.2. It will be helpful to give local authorities early guidance as to ourintentions for their current spending next year 1982-83, which will be reflectedin the Rate Support Grant (RSG) negotiations later.    Guidance given beforethe summer holidays will have more influence on actual spending next yearthan would a statement delayed until the autumn.    For England and Walescoming meetings of the Consultative Councils are suitable opportunities.3. Despite the conditional reductions in RSG, local authorities are likelyto overspend the March White Paper plans for relevant current expenditurefor the current year 1981-82 by at least  1 billion.    Political opposition tofurther cuts is increasing.    The further powers to influence local authorityexpenditure which we have discussed in the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy will not take effect before 1983-84.4. We, therefore, have to recognise that total local authority expenditurenext year is likely to be higher than whatever we may decide to put into thecalculations of RSG and into the next White Paper.    The issue is how we canbest influence local authorities to bring their expenditure down towards thelevels which we want.5. If we say nothing now, local authorities will continue their prepar-ation of plans and budgets in many cases on the assumption that theGovernment&apos;s intentions are the volume plans in the last White Paper, whichshow a reduction of 1 per cent between 1981-82 and 1982-8 3.    In fact, ofcourse, the change to cash planning, and associated methods of revaluation,are designed to carry forward a cash squeeze from one year to the next,unless it is specifically decided to admit a bid to make it good.    We nowexpect a cash squeeze of 2-3 per cent for local authorities in the currentyear because actual increases between 1980-81 and 1981-82 in their pay andprices are proving to be more than the cash limit factors for this year.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. We should accept bids for making good ouch a cash squeeze only inexceptional cases, and not for the generality of local authority expenditure.The greater part of this year&apos;s squeeze for the authorities will result frompay settlements which they have made, accepting the consequences for thisyear.    In these circumstances it is right to carry this squeeze forward tonext year.7. My proposal is that we should inform local authorities now that thisyear&apos;s decisions on the cash programmes will not be taken before the autumn.The inflation factors for 1982-83 will be reviewed then, and the cash pro-grammes as a whole considered further by the Government.    Meanwhile inany planning currently taking place local authorities should work on theprovisional assumption that the cash total for current expenditure used forcalculating the RSG will be not more than the total cash equivalent of the pro-grammes in the March White Paper, revalued on the formula agreed byCabinet for starting this year&apos;s Survey.    The White Paper figures at autumn1980 prices are converted to 1981-82 prices using the factors (11 per centand 6 per cent) agreed for this year&apos;s RSG and cash limits, and then revaluedforward for 1982-83 using for the present the single 7 per cent factor whichwe have provisionally adopted and used in our Survey discussions with localauthorities.    The 7 per cent is subject to revision in the autumn to the extentof any general revision of inflation factors for 1982-83 which may then bedecided by Cabinet.    The present calculation would allow 6 per cent morecash for 1982-83 than the figure used in the RSG settlements for 1981-82.8. This guidance should give local authorities practical advice withoutprejudicing our September and October decisions, including those on bids,if any, to make good carry forward of the squeeze.9. There is a case for special allowance for the extra cost of the pro-spective 1981 police pay settlement (say  90 million) and of allowing policeforces to recruit up to complement ( 2 5 million).    To announce this nowwould recognise our priority for the police service without abandoning thediscipline of cash planning.10. The general stance indicated by rr.y proposal is designedly tough.Because of the overspend in the current year, if local authorities actuallykept their cash spend next year to the level proposed, they would spend nomore cash next year than this year.    This would imply that on presentestimates they should reduce their current spending next year in volumeterms by some 7 per cent, that is 3-4 per cent to eliminate the 3-4 per centvolume excess in 1981-82, the Government&apos;s already intended volumereduction of 1 per cent between 1981-82 and 1982-83 as shown in the WhitePaper, and 2-3 per cent for the carry forward of the cash squeeze.11. While in general we ought to be aiming below the March White Paperfigures, in the case of local authorities current spending I doubt whetherspecifying now a further cut in the White Paper figures beyond the carryforward of this year&apos;s squeeze would help to get actual spending down.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL12, The question of bids to modify the effect of carrying forward thesqueeze, and whether we can afford them in the context of our decisions as awhole, will be for further discussion in the autumn.CONCLUSION13. I, therefore, invite Cabinet to ask the Secretaries of State for theEnvironment, for Scotland and for Wales to give guidance to local authoritieson the basis set out in paragraphs 7 and 10.LBTreasury Chambers20 July 19813CONFIDENTIAL
