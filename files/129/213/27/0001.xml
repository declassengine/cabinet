CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 52 COFY NO 8222 October 1981CABINETUNITED KINGDOM RELATIONS WITH THE VATICANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs1. After discussion with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland andothers, I should like to recommend to colleagues that the Vatican be invited topromote their representative in London to the ambassadorial status of a PapalPro-Nuncio and that Her Majesty&apos;s Legation to the Holy See should simultaneouslybe raised to the status of an Embassy.    I am also making suggestions about thetiming of these steps.2. The case for establishing full diplomatic relations with the Vaticanrests on the following arguments:i. The present level of relations has become an anomaly:the historical British conflicts with the Papacy have lost mostof their legal and political significance.    The Pope&apos;s visit tothe United Kingdom in May/June 1982 will inevitably give riseto public discussion of all aspects of our relations with theHoly See, and it would be helpful to remove this anomaly inadvance.ii. The majority of States (95 in all) have full diplomaticrelations with the Holy See.    The list includes all our Communitypartners (except the Danes) and the Australians and Canadians.The United States are represented by a Personal Envoy. TheVatican itself is thought likely to welcome full relations with us.iii. Pope John Paul has influence in areas where importantBritish interests are at stake including Ireland, Eastern Europeand the Middle East.iv. The Vatican has consistently condemned violence inNorthern Ireland and avoided being drawn into unhelpful comment.v. In ecclesiastical as well as political terms the maintenanceof a barrier to full diplomatic relations with the Vatican isanachronistic in the light of the growing ecumenical mood betweenthe Churches in Britain.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3. It would need to be agreed in advance with the Vatican that thePro-Nuncio&apos;s diplomatic responsibilities covered the whole of the UnitedKingdom.    His pastoral responsibilities would probably not include NorthernIreland which has always been within the (-responsibilities of the Archbishop ofArmagh, Primate of All Ireland; but that would be for the Vatican to decide.4. A change in the level of United Kingdom/Vatican relations is unlikelyto cause much stir in Britain.    But there may be some hostile reaction inNorthern Ireland, particularly if an announcement were made around the timeof the Papal Visit.    Similar considerations suggest that we should avoid anyrisk of an apparent connection with the forthcoming Anglo-Irish Summit(although it might be convenient for the Prime Minister to mention herintentions to the Taoiseach then).    The best timing for an announcement mighttherefore be around the turn of the year.5. If this proposal, and the timing of the announcement, are agreed, Ipropose that the Prime Minister should inform The Queen at her next Audience.The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Moderator of the Church of Scotland, whohave already been discreetly sounded and reacted positively^ would then beformally notified and the other Churches informed.    After that the terms ofthe announcement and any necessary questions relating to jurisdiction would bediscussed with the Vatican.CForeign and Commonwealth Office22 October 19812CONFIDENTIAL
