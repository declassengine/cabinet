SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 5724 November 1981PUBLIC EXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department1. This memorandum:a. reports on progress so far towards agreeing plant for public-expenditure, following discussions under my Chairmanship in theMinisterial Group on Public Expenditure (MISC 62) or elsewhere;b. lists the remaining programmes which have not been reedand indicates the main questions still at issue between Tie ryMinisters and other colleagues.PROGRESS SO FAR2. In his memorandum to the Cabinet on public expenditure(C(81) 51) the Chief Secretary, Treasury proposed that planned publicexpenditure should be  113. 5 billion in 1982-83,   118. 1 billion in 1983-84 and 124.8 billion in 1984-85:  respectively  3. i billion,   4. 2 billion and 5.2 billion more than the c ash equivalent of the plans in the last PublicExpenditure White Paper (Cmnd 8175);  but   3. 6 billion, f.6. 4 billion and 6,8 billion less than the total of Departments&apos; proposals.   Cabinet agreedon 20 October that in further discussions on public expenditure the aim shouldbe to get as near as possible to the totals proposed by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (CC(81) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 5).3. Agreement has now been reached on most programmes, includingthe external financing limits for all nationalised industries and all localauthority current expenditure except housing.    Brief details are in table 2of Annex A:  for all &quot;other&quot; Departments except the Office of Arts andLibraries (OAL), table 2 includes the effects of the general 2 per cent cut incash limited expenditure which the Chief Secretary, Treasury proposed inC(81) 51;  in the case of the OAL a specific cut of  3 million per annum hasbeen agreed.    The present position is as follows.    Taking account of progi &gt;so far both on agreed programmes and on programmes not yet fully agreed,the lowest possible outcome is  114. 7 billion in 1982-83,   120. 3 billion in1983-84 and  125.9 billion in 1984-85.

Supplemeiila ry lieiielit for 1&lt;&gt; year- oldsIt i s proposed that from November 1982 I 6 year- olds should nolonger be permitted to draw suppl e men ta r y benefit;   instead theii-parents will be able to claim child benefit.     The net saving willI).-  12 million in 1982-83,   OS million in 198&apos;4-8-1 and  &apos;10 millionin 1984-8S.     An additional provision in the Social Security Mill willbe necessary.     E   Committee has already agreed that supplemental ybenefit will not be paid to 16 year olds from September 198 i,   but ilwould be possible to justify that decision as helping Lo pay lor- |hecompn;hchsive youth training scheme which is to l&gt;&lt;   introduced atthe same time.     That argument cannot be used lo just ly withdrawingsupplementary benefit from 16 yea r olds next November;   it will bonecessary to argue that uim -rrpl  yed 16 year olds must look to theirparents for support.     &apos;I&apos;he allowances p.ii&lt;l to those pa r tioipa ling inthe Youth Opportunities Programme (YOP)are such that fromNovember 1982 16 year old YOP trainee;; will be about  2S a weekbetter- off than their unemployed contemporaries il the latter e.annolobtain supplementary benefit.      In Ins letter ol J 6 November to theSecretary of State; for Employment,  the Chief Sec rota r y,  &apos;I&apos;re.i miryhas therefore proposed that YOP allowanced should be reduced no anto give YOP trainee tf an advantage of about, i 12. 7 S a v/y   !  uvnr theirunemployed conto mpo ra ri c/1; who are not on a  YOP :&gt;&lt; hemu,   i  - thfname advantage an that enjoyed by trainee  under the new trainingscheme.     In hie reply of 2 &gt; November the Secretary of2SECRET
SECRETState for Employment has argued that the YOP allowance should notbe reduced and that 16 year olds&apos; right to supplementary benefitshould not be withdrawn until the new comprehensive youth trainingscheme is Introduced in September 1983;  in his view either decisionwould be likely to prejudice the successful introducti on of the newscheme.d. Health Charges ;Our policy of keeping prescription charges in line with cost increaseswould imply that they should increase in April 1982 from  1. 00 to 1.15.    It is now proposed that they should rise instead to  1. 30.Increases are also proposed in the charges for dental treatment(up to a total of  13 for a course *f routine treatment and up to 100 for dentures and dental crowns)  and fcr spectacle lenses(uo to  40).    Altogether these increases will yield savings of 44 million in 1982-83,   46 million in 1983-84 and  39 million in1984-85.    All of these charges are set out in Regulations, subjectto negative resolution.e. Road Traffic AccidentsThe plans for health expenditure set out in Table 2 of Annex Ainclude savings of  6 million in 1982-83,   93 million in 1983-84 and 101 million in 1984-8 5 from charging motor vehicle insurers thecost to the National Health Service of treating casualties in roadtraffic accidents.    This is on the assumption, which may not beproved correct, that it would be feasible to include provisions withthis effect in the 1982 Finance Bill.    If legislation had to be intro-duced instead in the 1982-83 Session the savings would be nil in1982-83,   45 million in 1983-84 and  101 million in 1984-85. TheSecretary of State for Social Services will be putting forwarddetailed proposals in the near future for a scheme which involves alevy on motor insurers and avoids the problem of &quot;no fault liability&quot;which was a feature of earlier proposals.f. National Health Service (NHS) PayIn his memorandum C(81) 44 the then Secretary of State for SocialServices proposed increased expenditure to permit certain groupsof NHS staff to receive increases of more than 4 per cent in the nextpay round.    The totals for health expenditure set out in table 2 ofAnnex A make no extra provision for this purpose on the understand-ing that the Secretary of State will use his best endeavours to keepincreases to not more than 4 per cent;  but that he may need tore-open the matter in the light of developments.3SECRET
SECRETg.       Property Services Agency (PSA)MISC 62  agreed to a reduction of  20 million (about A\ per cent)per annum :n planned expenditure by the PSA.    The Secretary ofState for the Environment pointed out that, to the extent that the PSAare unable to find the required savings by speeding up disposals orincreasing efficiency, other Ministers&apos; plans and programmes willbe adversely affected.CONTINUING DISAGREEMENT5. Expenditure totals have not been agreed for housing and otherenvironmental cervices.    Annex B gives an outline of the points at issue onthese programmes.6. I invite my colleagues to decide on the public expenditure totals forthese programmes for the years 1982-83 and 1983-84, together with thecon sequential s for 1984-85; and to endorse the totals for agreed programmeslisted in table 2 of Annex A.W WHome Office24 November 19814SECRET

Cabinet agreed on 12 Novemberthat further work on the Rate Support Grant settlement in 1982-83 should be on theassumption of council house rent increases averaging  2.50 a week (CC(8l)36thConclusions, Item 5).2. To maintain in 1982-83 the 1981-82 volume of capital, management andmaintenance expenditure within the total Cmnd 8175 provision of  3,869 millionwould have required rent increases averaging about  4 a week.    The provisionaldecision that rent increases should average  2.50 means that if the housing totalis not to be increased there must be offsetting savings of  225 million in housingcapital expenditure.    The Secretary of State for the Environment is opposed to thisreduction.    He also recommends additional provision of  67 million for themanagement and maintenance of housing stock.3. The Chief Secretary suggested in C(8l)51 that the existing housing total shouldbe cut by  93 million.    This together with the  292 million addition recommended bythe Secretary of State for the Environment gives a gap of  385 million.4. The table shows the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals for 1983-84 and 1984-85. TheSecretary of State has not yet made proposals for these years.    Cabinet will needto decide on these in the light of their decisions on 1982-83.SECRET

The Secretary of State for the Environment points out that thesereductions involve substantial cuts in public sector investment and wouldhave an immediate and undesirable impact on the construction industry.Both water industry and local authority investment have, moreover, beendrastically cut over the past few years.3. MISC 62 recognises the force of the Secretary of State&apos;s objectionsto the cuts proposed.    Given the choice, they are not the sort of reductionswhich the Government should be making.    These reductions can however beeasily achieved and involve neither legislation nor the breaking of publiccommiements.    The Group recommends that the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposalsshould be accepted.SECRET
SECRETANNEX B(ii) contd4.     In discussion subsequent to MISC 62, the Secretary of State hassuggested that on these two items taken together the largest cuts towhich he might be able to agree are  80 million in 1982-83 and  100 millionin each of the two following years.2SECRET
