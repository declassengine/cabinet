CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81)44 1 COPY NO 8110 September 1981CABINETPAY AND CASH PLANNING IN THE NATIONAL HEALTHSERVICE, 1982-83Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services1. In our consideration of how to handle the next round of public servicespay, there are some particular problems in the National Health Service (NHS)which I wish tc bring to colleagues&apos; attention.2. In the present round, I have managed to hold the pay increases of allNHS staff groups to the bare 6 per cent.    This is the maximum that can beafforded without cuts in health services.    It is, so far as 1 am aware, thesmallest increase that has been secured during this pay round for so large ablock of staff in the public services, and compares with l\ per cent for theCivil Service and local government, and even higher increases for certainother groups.    It will not be possible to get away with holding NHS pay belowother public sector groups again;  moreover there is no economic logic thatstaff in a service to which we, as a Government, have attached high priority -so that there is little or no scope for the reductions in staff numbers whichhave elsewhere been used to finance higher pay increases - should because ofthe operation of cash limits, have their pay treated significantly less favourablythan staff working in services which are of lower priority and where staff cutsare therefore possible.3. I do not believe that we can allow this peculiarly unfavourable situationto continue.    It is, moreover, likely to be made even more unfavourablebecause of developments elsewhere in the public services.    I have particularlyin mind the important concessions which have been offered to the Civil Service -i. Negotiations before next year&apos;s cash limit is determined.ii. Right of access to independent arbitration, the outcome of whichcan be overturned only by a Parliamentary vote.J-t is going to be argued that similar arrangements should be available to theNHS. Clearly this is not cn; but it will not be too easy to produce logicallyconvincing arguments in rebuttal.    It will also be urged - and this again is a1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpoint which it is not easy to push aside - that it is quite wrong to give lessfavourable treatment to a service almost all of which has not taken industrialaction (and of which an important staff group has said that they will not do so)than to one which has recently been involved in long and very damaging action.4. While I therefore believe that there is a strong case for special treat-ment for the NHS, I am not seeking to argue for a special NHS pay factorgreater than the factor which applies to other parts of the public services.This is on the basis that there will be no settlements elsewhere in the publicservices in excess of the pay factor.     On this assumption, all that is requiredis, in my view, special treatment for a limited number of staff groups - itsjustification being that it is needed to ensure that a satisfactory service can beprovided to the public.    I am thinking in particular of the nurses, the doctorsand dentists, and a very small number of smaller staff groups.    We havealready agreed that some kind of favourable treatment for the nurses must becontemplated but it is not a practicable possibility unless money is availablespecifically for that purpose, so that nurses are not having their positionimproved at the expense of other staff groups.    Similarly I would hope that, iflimited additional funds were available for doctors and dentists, it would bepossible to agree on arrangements which would make possible the continuedfunctioning of the Doctors and Dentists Review Body, though with atemporarily circumscribed role which would oblige them to tailor theirrecommendations to the amount of extra money we were prepared to makeavailable.    If we lost the Review Body, we should, I believe, be at risk of beinglocked in more or less permanent confrontation with the two professions.5. I propose therefore that the NHS should be subject to the general payfactor, but that some additional money should be provided for the pay ofcertain crucial staff groups directly concerned with patient care whereparticular service problems arise.    Such a decision should not be announceduntil we are ready to announce the size of the overall cash provision for the NHS(probably in October/November).    On this basis, I consider that there is a goodchance that, unless there is concerted action by all trade unions against theGovernment&apos;s policy generally, it will be possible, as this year, to achieve paysettlements in the NHS which are in full conformity with the cash limit.Without a special arrangement such as I have outlined, the coming pay roundwill present severe and possibly insoluble difficulties.    No Government has everwon a confrontation with the nurses.P Jepartment of Health and Social Security&apos; September 19812CONFIDENTIAL
