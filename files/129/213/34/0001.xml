CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(8l) 599 December 1981COPY NOCABINETTHE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS:COMPENSATION FOR CLOSED SHOP VICTIMSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment1. My minute of 1 December to the Prime Minister and the noteattached to it explained my proposals for compensating closed shop victimsfrom the 1974-80 period and the background to them (Annex A).2. The subsequent minutes (Annex B) from the Lord Chancellor(7 December), the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (7 December), theChancellor of the Exchequer (8 December), the Secretary of State for theEnvironment (7 December), the Secretary of State for Trade (7 December)and the Attorney General (3 December) have not questioned the moraljustification for providing some compensation for these people but they haveemphasised the danger of creating a precedent for Human Rights cases onother subjects.    They have also drawn attention vo the danger that acompensation scliame might itself provide grounds for further complaints toStrasbourg.3. I believe that these dangers can be minimised (although I recognise,not entirely eliminated) by the way in which the compensation scheme ispresented.4. In the first place, I believe we can justify a compensation scheme onits own merits without linking it specifically to the judgment of the EuropeanCourt in the British Rail case.    We can draw attention to the fact that 1974-80was the only period since the concept of &quot;unfair dismissal&quot; was introduced intoour law in 1971 when there has been no protection (except on very narrowlydefined grounds) for people who lost their jobs for non-membership of a tradeunion and the only time in our history when the law has positively encouragedthe enforcement of the closed shop by declaring such dismissals &quot;fair&quot;. Wecan emphasis our consistently held view that the legislation of 1974 and 1976was unjust and our commitment to repealing it.    Moreover, we can claim thatthe criteria for the compensation scheme are substantially the same (but forthe balloting requirement for new agreements) as the grounds fur unfairdismissal laid down in the Employment Act and that they are not directly relate,to the European Court&apos;s judgment.    (In this respect it is ni course helpful thatthe Court confined itself almost entirely to the particular circumstances of theThree Railmen and did not address itself to the general issue of whether or notthe closed shop itself is a breach of the European Convention of Human Rights. )1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. We can therefore justify a compensation scheme &amp;n the groundsthat it will provide retrospective justice for those who have Buffered from aspecific piece of legislation, now repealed.    As I pointed out in paragraph 5of my minute to the Prime Minister, I believe that on these grounds we candistinguish closed shop victims from others who may seek to use this schemeas a precedent in order to claim compensation from, the Govei anient, in thelight of judgments of the European Court on other subjects.6. As the Lord Chancellor suggests in his minute, I propose to defineeligibility for compensation in detail (perhaps in a schedule to the Bill) onthe lines indicated in the note attached to my minute of 1 December.     It isparticularly important to exclude dismissals which occurred either beforethe 1974 Act came into operation or after the 1976 legislation was repealed.I also propose to make it clear that the criteria to be applied in assessingindividual cases will be exactly the same as those applied by industrialtribunals under the Employment Act and that the amount of compensationpaid will be subject to the maximum limits in force at the time of thedismissal.7. I acknowledge that it is essential to ensure that the compensationscheme does not itself provide grounds for further complaints to Strasbourg.I would hope that we could achieve this by making payments under the schemediscretionary and ensuring that we create no new statutory rights. Myofficials will of course consult the Law Officers Department in drawing updetails of the scheme and the necessary legislative provisions.8. Finally, I would emphasise that there are many practical advantagesin proceeding as I propose and many real dangers in doing nothing.    As Imentioned in my minute to the Prime Minister, there is already pressurefor such compensation from the Freedom Association and some of our back-benchers.    If we do not respond to this pressure, the Freedom Associationmay nonetheless try to take further cases to Strasbourg - they haveapparently been advised that such cases are not necessarily out of time -and even if they fail such cases would be bound to give rise to a great deal offurther unfavourable publicity.    In any case, I do not see how we can avoidpaying some compensation to the 40 other former British Rail employeeswho were dia$acii*sed under the Bame-el&amp;sfld qhop agreement in exactlycomparable circumstances.    Furthermore, I believe that - in contrast tothe likely reaction to some other recent, well publicised cases before theEuropean Court - there would be wide public support for compensatingclosed shop victims who lost;, their jobs without any compensation at thetime.    Finally, I see political advantages in including the necessary powersfor such a scheme in the forthcoming Bill from the outset:  the closed shopis an embarrassing issue for the Opposition (particularly since theirlegislation had been found to be in breach of the European Convention) andone on which we must not be outbid by the other parties.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL9. I believe I should be able to accommodate the cost of thecompensation scheme within the existing financial provisions for myDepartment for 1982-83 and 1983-84.10. I therefore seek agreement to a scheme on the lines proposed in myminute 61 1 December 1981.M TDepartment of Employment9 December 19813CONFIDENTIAL
PRIME MINISTERTHE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTSCOMPENSATION FOR CLOSED SHOP VICTIMS1. As you know the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourghave found that the dismissal of 3 Railmen in 1976 withoutcompensation in a closed shop under the last Government&apos;s legislationwas in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Thechanges in the law made in the Employment Act 1980 (soon to bereinforced by the proposals agreed at E on 10 November) ensure that,were such dismissals do occur now, there would be a legal right tocompensation.Under these circumstances, I am satisfied that nofurther closed shop cases could be successfully brought unless theCourt were to rule that the closed shop itself was in breach of theConvention.    The Court specifically declined to rule on this generalissue in the British Rail case.2. The urgent question now is that of compensation.    There aretwo aspects to this.    The first is the question of compensation forthe 3 Railmen and for the 6 former employees of Hull City Corporationwho were dismissed in 1977 in comparable circumstances and whosecase is before the European Commission of Human Rights.    We are nowendeavouring, through the Commission, to reach a friendly settlementwith the 3 Railmen.    This can then set the pattern for a settlementin the Hull City Corporation case.3-      The second and more difficult question is that of otherclosed shop victims who were dismissed in the same circumstancesunder the last Government&apos;s legislation but who have not takentheir case to Strasbourg.    To begin with there are some ^0 otherformer British Rail employees who were dismissed under the sameclosed shop agreement.    However, there are also an unknown number
of other people  (some estimates have put it as high as ^00 butthere is no way of knowing precisely how many there are) whowere dismissed in comparable circumstances in other occupationsbetween 197^ and the coming into force of the Employment Actin August 1980.    There is of course no legal obligation on theGovernment to compensate any of these other closed shop victims.Such a legal obligation could derive only from proceedings by themin Strasbourg and, while I understand that the Freedom Associationbelieve that such proceedings might still be possible, I amadvised that proceedings based on their dismissal are no longeropen to them.    However, I believe that in the light of theBritish Rail case and of our consistent opposition to the lastGovenment&apos;s closed shop legislation there is a moral obligationon us to offer some compensation to these people. Politicalconsiderations point to the same conclusion:  there is alreadysome pressure for this from our backbenchers and from theFreedom Association and this pressure is likely to grow oncea settlement of the 3 Railmen&apos;s claim is reached.k.      I have considered whether an offer of compensation could belimited to the other former British Rail employees dismissedunder the same closed shop agreement but my conclusion is thatwe could not justify this.    If we were to compensate otherformer British Rail employees on the grounds that the case broughtby the 3 Railmen was a &quot;representative action&quot;, we would have toconcede that the Hull City Corporation case constituted asimilar precedent.    There are bound to have been other dismissalsin strictly comparable circumstances under closed shop agreementsdrafted in terms very similar to the British Rail and Hullagreements  (modelled on the 1976 Act):    it would be difficultto defend a refusal of any compensation in other cases once wehad conceded it in these cases.    I see no alternative thereforeto offering compensation to a_nyone dismissed in a closed shop
(  . A&quot;v&apos;o &quot;  &apos;sin the same circumstances as the 3 Railmen between 197^ and 1980.5.      I am of course mindful of the danger of setting a precedentfor cases on other subjects which have or may in the futurecome before the Commission and Court at Strasbourg. Thereare about 100 individual applications against the UK Governmentcurrently before the Commission.    Some recent adverse judgementsof the Court (eg detention on grounds of mental disorder andhomosexuality in Northern Ireland) have received considerablepublicity and other cases likely to attract publicity (egcorporal punishment in schools, compensation for airport noiseand the effect of recent changes in the immigration rules) arein the pipeline and may also go against the Government. Clearlywe should take every possible step to ensure that the actionI propose in relation to the closed shop cannot be used tojustify claims for similar schemes of general compensation inother cases.    I believe that a distinction can be drawnbetween the British Rail and other Human Rights cases on thegrounds that this breach of the Convention resulted from aparticular piece of legislation, very recent in its enactmentand politically controversial in nature which, moreover, wasrepealed before the case was heard by the Court and well beforethe judgement was delivered.    The breach of the Conventionrelated to a specific six year period in the past and wouldnot have occurred under current legislation.    On this basis Ibelieve that we can make it clear that the action we areproposing in this case does not bind us to offer compensationin any other case where people claim that they have grievanceswhich are comparable with those which have been found by theCourt to constitute a breach of the Convention.6.      I realise that claims for comparable treatment in othercases may still be made if we proceed as I propose. Nevertheless,
I believe that the difficulty of resisting such claims, if theyare made, will be much less than the difficulty we would face ifwe were to refuse in this case to provide any compensation - onthe grounds that we were under no legal obligation - to a groupof people whom our supporters and many people in the countrywill see as highly deserving.7. The details of the compensation scheme I propose are setout in the attached note. The cost is unlikely to exceed 12mand in practice I would expect it to be a good deal less.I propose to seek legislative cover for the scheme in theforthcoming industrial relations legislation.    The necessaryprovisions should not be complex and need not delay introductionof the Bill.    I would, however, like to be able to ensure thatParliamentary Counsel receives instructions on this matterwithin two weeks and I would therefore be grateful to knowby the end of this week if you or colleagues consider that Ishould not proceed on the lines I propose so that the issuemight then be considered by E on 10 December.8. I am sending copies of this minute and the attached noteto the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor, the Foreign Secretary,the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland,  the Secretary of State for the Environment,the Secretary of State for Industry, the Secretary of Statefor Trade, the Secretary of State for Transport, the Secretaryof State for Social Services,  the Attorney General and toother members of E Committee.N TDecember 19-81
COMPENSATION FOR CLOSED SHOP VICTIMS 197^-1980EligibilityThe European Court, while not pronouncing on the general issueof dismissal for non-membership of a trade union in a closed shop,gave particular weight to the fact that the three railmen wereexisting employees when the closed shop agreement was introducedand that two of them had conscientious objections to unionmembership.    We clearly need to reflect these concerns in decidingwho should benefit from a wider compensation scheme.    I thereforepropose that compensation should be paid tc anyone dismissed fornon-membership of a trade union in a closed shop under the 197*4and 1976 legislation providing either that he or she:(1) was an existing employee when the closed shop agreementcame in and did not subsequently join a union in accor-dance with the agreement; or(2) had a conscientious objection to union membership (asdefined in the 1980 Act).I appreciate that there may be difficulty in some cases inestablishing whether or not there were genuine conscientiousobjections seme years after the event but there are advantagesin aligning the criteria with the two major grounds on whichdismissal in a closed shop is unfair under the Employment Act.Moreover, it would invite controversy about the implications ofthe judgement to exclude conscientious objection.The compensation scheme would exclude  (in addition to anyone whocould not meet the criteria above):(1) dismissals during the currency of the 1971 Act (improbable)or before 1971 when there was no statutory protection againstunfair dismissal;(2) the rare cases where closed shop dismissals were found tobe unfair  (eg on religious grounds) under the 197^ and 1976Acts since there has already been a remedy; and
(3) any dismissals since the 1980 Act came into force.Level of compensationAs far as the three ex-British Rail employees are concerned, thecompensation we offer will need to reflect various factors, whichIndustrial Tribunals are not always able to consider, eg the actualextent of subsequent unemployment.    However, as far as the compensationscheme is concerned, -I think it important to relate the rate ofcompensation as closely as possible to the structure of IndustrialTribunal awards since these would have provided the domestic remedyhad one been available.    Thus I propose that compensation shouldcomprise    (a) a basic award dependent on length of service and subjectto the appropriate tribunal maximum ( 2,400 in 1976)  and (b)a compensatory award calculated according to the actual loss of earnings,pensions etc suffered in the period since dismissal but similarly subjectto the appropriate upper limit on compensatory awards  ( 5,200 in 1976).Interest would be paid on both sums.    Total compensation in individualcases would range from a few hundred pounds for a short service employeewho found another equally good or better job Immediately after dismissal,to around  10,000 (including interest)  for a long-service employee whohas been unable to find other work.These amounts will be substantially lower than the sums of compensationwhich we are likely to pay to two of the three ex-British Rail employees.The distinction can, however, be defended on the basis that it Is onlythe three former railmen who have to face the costs and stresses offighting a case lasting several years through the Commission and theCourt.CostThe total cost of c cmp6ns s tion under my proposals depends crucially onthe number of cases of closed shop dismissals between 1974 and I98O.It has been suggested in the Press that there were over 400 such cases.However,  research recently carried out for my Department suggests thatthe actual figure is unlikely to exceed 400.    Assuming 400 cases and
an^verage compensation payment of  5,000 (possibly on the high side)&apos;,the total cost would be around 12 million.    To the extent that some ofthose eligible may in the event not come forward the final cost couldbe lower.ProcedureThe procedure which I have in mind for  &quot;ealing with these cases is toinvite people who think they may be eligible to apply for compensationby a given date.    The cases would then be considered by an assessorwith a legal background appointed by me who would advise on thepayments to be made in individual cases.    The payments themselves wouldbe at my discretion.While it would be possible to make payments of the order anticipatedwithout specific legislative cover,    I am advised that the normalpractice is to seek legislative authority.    I therefore propose toinclude the necessary provisions in the forthcoming industrial relationslegislation.    Some 5 clauses may be required.Department of Employment1 December 1981N T
Annex BHousi en Lords.SYV1A OPWPRIME MINISTEREUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS -COMPENSATION FOR CLOSED SHOP VICTIM  1. I have seen copies of the Secretary of State forEmployment&apos;s minute to you of ist December and the AttorneyGeneral&apos;s minute of 3rd December.      I think there are someimportant points that we  should bear in mind when discussingthe matter later this week.2. I have no doubt that the case for compensating thevictims of the closed shop legislation is very strong onmoral grounds.      We  should,  therefore,  be prepared to offercompensation not only to those who brought cases in Strasbourgbut also to those who can establish that they were dismissedin comparable circumstances.      Like the Attorney General, Ido not think that it would be possible to argue convincinglythat what we now propose cannot be taken as a precedent forthe payment of compensation in future human rights cases.It will certainly be taken as a precedent and this is theprice that we must pay for our adherence to the Conventionand our acceptance of the right of individual petition. Onthe other hand,   the situations which give rise to cases ofthis kind suggest that it will only be on .rare occasions thatsubstantial compensation would be appropriate.      In a majorityof instances,   applicants will have  suffered little or no lossfor which they can be compensated.3- With regard to the closed shop cases, we should beprepared to compensate all those who can establish that theyCONFIDENTIAL.../2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL-?-Housi: or Lords,SW1A OPWwere unfairly dismissed as a result of the legislation whichhas been held to be in breach of the European Convention.Tne category of case will have to be carefully defined inthe proposed legislation if we are to avoid paying compensationin cases which could have occurred before 1974. Moreover,1 do not think that it is necessary for the Government to goout of its way to discover possible instances of unfairdismissal which could qualify for coiopensation.      A publicannouncement of our intentions and the passage of the necessarylegislation will be  sufficient.      It should, however, be madeclear that cases will be carefully scrutinised because itwould be wrong to leave the impression that any dismissalwhich took place where a closed shop was in existence necessarilyfell within the terms of the European Court&apos;s ruling.4.

CONFIDENTIALPM/81/62PRIME MINISTEREuropean Court of Human Rights:Compensation for Closed Shop Victims1. The Secretary of State for Employment sent me acopy of his minute of 1 December to you.    I have since seena copy of the minute of 3 December from the Attorney-General.2. As you know, this Office deals, in the capacityof agent in the proceedings, with all cases against the UKGovernment before the Strasbourg Commission and Court. Weare therefore very much aware both of the large number ofsuch cases - around 100 pending at present,  as Normar Tebbitsays in his paragraph 5 - and of the wide range of issueswhich they cover.    We have also become very familiar with theextended interpretation which the Commission and Court giveto the term &quot;victim&quot; of a violation of the Convention (forexample, in the Northern Ireland case to which Norman Tebbitrefers, the applicant had not been prosecuted under thehomosexuality laws:    he was found by the Court to be a victimbecause, no doubt like many others, he was affected by themere existence of those laws).3. Given this extended interpretation, I think wemay create serious difficulties for ourselves in other cases -not only the Northern Ireland case but also cases relating toairport noise, immigration, detention on grounds of mentaldisorder and corporal punishment in schools - if, in thepresent case, we depart from the position that our duty tocompensate applies only to the limited category of those who  x /have:CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhave taken proceedings in Strasbourg and have actually beenfound to be &quot;victims&quot;.     I    of course    see the force of thedomestic political considerations to which Norman Tebbitrefers;    but unless there is a really convincing distinctionwhich we can rely on to block off this case from others infuture, we must in my view accept that by going beyond thatlimited category and compensating also people who might haveclaimed successfully to be victims, we may be creating whatcould be a very expensive precedent; indeed.    And I have to saythat,  like the Attorney-General,  I am not satisfied that thedistinction suggested here is anywhere near good enough forthe purpose.    Nor, I fear, do I see any other distinction onwhich we could safely rely.4. I also agree with what the Attorney-General saysin his paragraph 3 about the need to guard against the riskof further applications to Strasbourg on the basis of anycompensation scheme which might be established.5.

I entirely agree with the political arguments which NormanTebbit advances,  but I think that it would be worthwhile to havea short discussion of his proposals  in E Committee on 10 December.We need to be clear about possible repercussions,  and how costs areto be accommodated;    and  it might be sensible also to considerwhether there would be tactical advantage in our appearing to responto Parliamentary pressure,  rather than ourselves creating a newprinciple of ex gratia compensation to match judgements of theEuropean Court.3.

Trade is in the lead here but, if thecase goes badly, Transport&apos;s interests and the corresponding onesin the Scottish and Welsh Offices could also be seriously affected.My interest, which is less direct, is as custodian of the policy andlaw on land compensation and allied matters.The Commission have provisionally found the Government in breach inthe Gatwick case.   John Biffen is awaiting the Attorney General&apos;sadvice on the effects that might be set by the precedent of a friendlysettlement.    To legislate as you propose for the closed shop casesis at first sight likely to hazard greatly the prospects of contain-ing these effects.   At its worst the result would be very much morecostly than the settlements in your proposal.I think therefore we must discuss the issue with our colleagues.I am copying this to the Prime Minister and to copy addressees ofyour minute.MICHAEL HESELTINEThe Rt Hon Norman Tebbit Esq MPCONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL. . ^ e* .PRIME MINISTERTHE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTSCOMPENSATION FOR CLOSED SHOP VICTIMS1. I have seen a copy of the Secretary of State for Employment&apos;sminute to you of 1 December.    This is essentially a question ofpolicy rather than of law but there are two points on which I shoulfcomment.2. First, the clanger of setting a precedent for cases on othersubjects, which is discussed in paragraph 5j  is a very real one.Once we accept that a finding of a violation of the Conventionin a particular case carries with it a moral obligation to paycompensation not only in that case but in all comparable cases,, itwill be difficult indeed to resist demands for the payment out ofpublic funds of what may be quite large sums - and in cases thatwe ray find much less politically attractive than the present case,I have to say that the distinction which is suggested in the secondhalf of paragraph 5 of the Secretary of State&apos;s minute is one whichI find unconvincing.    I find it hard to see why there is a greatermoral obligation to pay compensation in respect of a defect in ourlav; which was of short dura13on end war, in fact removed from ourstatute book even before the Court&apos;s judgment than there is inrespect of a defect which we deliberately persisted in to the bitteend ana removed only under the compulsion of a finding by theEuropean Court.3. My second comment relates to the procedure for awardingcompensation which is described in the last section of the noteattached to the Secretary of State&apos;s minute.    In working out thedetails of that procedure and in formulating the terms in which itis prescribed, we shall need to be very careful that we do not/leaveCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALleave any scope for further complaints to the European Commissionof Human Rights asserting that what is involved amounts to aviolation either of Article 6.of the Convention (the right to afair adjudication in the determination of one&apos;s civil rights) orArticle 14 (no discrimination in the enjoyment of one&apos;s right-;).It is precisely because I agree with the assessment in paragraphs1 and 3 of the Secretary of State&apos;s minute that further complaintto the Commission based upon the original dismissal are no longerpossible that I think that the Freedom Association, if they aredissatisfied with the terms offered, may be astute to find groundsuch as this for taking their case once more to Strasbourg.4.
