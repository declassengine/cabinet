CONFIDENTIALIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 28 COPY NO g 9 June 1981CAE INETLOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE: PUBLICEXPENDITURE SURVEY OPTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment1. Colleagues will recall that when Cabinet discussed the 1981 PublicExpenditure Survey guidelines on 7 May (CC(81) 18th Conclusions, Minute 5),the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paper (C(81) 20, paragraph 19iv. ) proposedthat the &quot;provisional working assumption&quot; - the inflation factor - &quot;should begiven to local authority expenditure groups&quot;.    I am now being asked by anumber of colleagues to release to the local authority associations not only theinflation assumption - with which I am quite content - but also to seek localauthority views on the consequences of the 3 per cent and 5 per cent options forreductions in 1982-83 and the 5 per cent and 7j per cent for later years.2. I am firmly convinced that this would be quite wrong.    First, Cabinetdid not discuss the view that local authorities should be given the range ofoptions.    Second, following my announcement on 2 June, I believe that toinvite local authority reactions to options for further reductions in theircurrent spending, going as far as an additional l\ per cent, would provoke anexplosion, with our own supporters in local government in the vanguard. Itmust be clear that since local government is now 8 per cent over our currentexpenditure targets in cash terms for 1981-82, a further 5 per cent in 1982-83would imply a 13 per cent reduction between years.    We could not thereforeexpect a sensible response.    We would stir up the most immense opposition,for no useful purpose.    Third, the release of the options to local governmentwould enable the pressure groups to marshal their forces sooner rather thanlater:  any such special pleading would make realistic cuts that much moredifficult.3. I recognise that the fact that the Government is looking at these optionreductions across the board is already public knowledge.    But I believe that toask local government to consider these options now would actually make ourtask in reducing expenditure more difficult, since the fear of further cuts onthis scale could cause even our supporters in the shii e counties to give uptrying to meet our present targets.    In any event, we do not need the localauthorities to tell us that reductions on the scale envisaged would requireaction from the Government - almost certainly in the form of legislation whichreduces their duties.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTREASURY VIEW4. The Treasury point out that, as I have acknowledged, the option cutsexercise is already public knowledge;  the size of the cuts being studied is alsoknown.    Local authorities have taken part in similar exercises in previousyears, and are well aware that it is the practice to examine the effects forparticular services of cuts on a scale which will give Ministers scope forchanges in priorities as well as for overall reductions;  and that there is nonecessary implication that cuts of this size will be made in particular cases.In-house study would have little chance of remaining private.    Moreover, theresult would be unlikely to command the co-operation of local authorities ifthey had been denied their traditional part in planning.    Delay in issuing thisinformation is already imperilling the Survey timetable.    The Treasurybelieve it should now be given to local authority expenditure groups withoutfurther ado.CONCLUSION5. Although I accept that the Tieasury view represents what would havebeen acceptable in different circumstances, I believe that politically we shouldnot pursue it at this time.    I therefore seek colleagues&apos; agreement that,whilst the inflation assumptions should be issued to the local authorityassociations, we should not at this stage involve them in our examination ofthe option reductions.M HDepartment of the Environment9 June 19812CONFIDENTIAL
