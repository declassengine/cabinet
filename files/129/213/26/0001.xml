SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 5114 October 1981COPY NO82CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITUREMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryINTRODUCTION1. This paper contains specific proposals for the various expenditureprogrammes which would achieve the totals suggested in the parallel paperby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(81) 50).THE PROPOSAL2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I propose the public expenditureplanning total for 1982-83 and 1983-84 should be, compared with the WhitePaper revalued:1981 White Paper(revalued and adjustedfor Gas Levy, etc)Expected outturnProposalConsequential for 1984-8 51980-81 1981-82104. 5  billion1982-83     1983-84 1984-85109. 9113. 9119. 694. 2107. 3113. 5118.1124. 83. The relationship of these proposed totals to the White Paper, to thepresent position and to the additional bids is shown in Table 1 attached. Th&lt;proposals in general fall short of what is proposed by Departments but arestill substantially higher than those in the last White Paper.    The problemsthat even this proposed increase of spending would present are discussed inthe Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paper (C(81) 50).1SECRET
SECRETTHE ALLOCATION TO DEPARTMENTS4. I propose that the allocation to Departments should be as in Table 2.Table 3 shows these allocations in relation to cash gpent in 1978-79, to showthe relative growth of expenditure by different Departments.    Annex A setsout for each Department:i. How the proposed provision compares with that providedfor in the White Paper and that sought through the bids.ii. An explanation of the main considerations leading to myproposal for that Department.5. Departmental Ministers will be receiving details of how expenditurecould be kept to the level I propose.    In several cases the scale or significanceof the policy change will be such that it requires collective endorsement, andin some cases legislation.    We should need to give that endorsement beforeor as part of agreement to the figures.    The cases where such policy changesappear to be required are identified in the Annex.6. If departmental Ministers see such difficulty about my detailedproposals that they would prefer to adopt some other ways of keeping to thefigures I have proposed for them, with different changes in policy, it will ofcourse be open to them to suggest such ways.     But we shall need to satisfyourselves that the ways proposed will indeed achieve the required level ofexpenditure, and similarly endorse any major policy changes involved. Inany event, however, if the provision for local authority current expenditurein programmes is fixed this year on the basis of realism, and is apportionedon the basis agreed in the Ministerial Group on the Rate Support Grant(MISC 21), it would not be appropriate for departmental Ministers to switchto or from that provision within their programmes.GENERAL POINTS(a)        Status of the Figures7. The figures which we decide for 1982-83 are to be regarded as firmceilings, subject only to the adjustments to demand-led elements for changedeconomic assumptions (paragraph 2 5) below.    They will be translated directlyinto detailed Estimates and cash limits, subject to any further reductionswhich the Estimates scrutiny shows to be possible.    Any subsequent decisionsto add to them will be charged to the Contingency Reserve.8. The figures for 1983-84 will be subject to review next year.    But wemust avoid repeating then what has happened last year and this - namelyincreasing substantially the amount provided.    The regular repetition ofsubstantial upward revision to our published public expenditure plans bringsdiscredit on our administration of public expenditure.    In so doing itcontributes to a loss of confidence - particularly in financial markets - in theGovernment&apos;s economic policy.    We need to ensure that the figures are2SECRET
SECRETrealistic, and that Departments take the necessary action during the comingyear so that they can live within them in 1983-84, rather than make additionalbids next year.9. The figure in paragraph 2 for 1984-85 is the product of carrying throughto that year the programmes, Departments&apos; bids and my proposals far theprevious years.    It implies a slight increase in real terms in spending for1984-8 5, compared with 1983-84.    I do not think this is satisfactory. Ipropose that we should ask officials (ie the Public Expenditure SurveyCommittee) to produce a further report on the policy, or other, initiativeswhich will be required on that longer time scale to achieve a substantialreduction in the level of expenditure compared with the figure for 1984-85 inparagraph 2.    We can decide on the basis of that report the proper level ofspending in that year to be published in the White Paper.(b)        Nationalised Industries External Finance10. The industries originally bid in total for some  2, 500 million for1982-83, in addition to the  1, 470 million provided for in the White Paper(revalued and adjusted to take account of the Gas Levy).    The increasessought were even larger in later years.    The Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy agreed in July to aim to restrict extra provision to 750 million a year.    The further series of consultations since then havesecured reductions in the bids for 1982-83 of  775 million, leaving an excessof  910 million over the previously agreed increase of  750 million. Ipropose that we should make a further reduction of  480 million, and that theExternal Financing Limits (EFLs) in 1982-83 should be  1,180 million over theprovision in the White Paper revalued.    My proposals for individual industriesare set out in Annex B.11. The further consultations between Departments and industries to reducethe larger excesses in the two later years have not yet been completed, eothat I cannot yet make a proposal for these years.    But in considering ourplans for other programmes and the total, it would be prudent to proceed onthe basis that some of the further excess in the later years will have to beaccepted, say one third.     That would add respectively  600 million and 550 million in those years bringing the total increase over the White Paperprovision to  1,350 million and  1,300 million respectively.    This temporaryprovision is without prejudice to what I will propose when the examination iscomplete.(c)        Capital and Current Expenditure12. We agreed in our discussions this summer that it would be desirableto increase the proportion of capital expenditure in the total.    The last WhitePaper provided for central and local government capital expenditure for1982-83 and 1983-84 which was only 10. 2 per cent and 9. 7 per cent respec-tively of total public expenditure (excluding finance for nationalisedindustries throughout).    Although that statistic is of limited significance(since capital, as conventionally defined in public expenditure statistics, is bySECRET
SECRETno means the same as eitner expenditure on productive investment orprocurement from the private sector), I would nevertheless have wished toimprove the proportion.13. However, on the same basis, only some 5 per cent of the bidsoriginally put forward by Departments were for central and local governmentcapital.    The bids agreed so far, such as for employment measures, theincreased provision for local authorities and the various estimating changeshave all been for current expenditure.    I am having to reject more than halfof the outstanding bids of  2\ billion for 1982-83 and  3| billion for 1983-84:18 per cent and 10 per cent respectively of those are for capital expenditure.As a result, in putting forward proposals to bring the prospective excess overthe White Paper back from S.l\ billion and  10^ billion in the two years to halfthese figures, I have inevitably not been able to make the desired shift. Thenet outcome is that central and local government capital expenditure will be9. 5 per cent and 8. 9 per cent of total expenditure in 1982-83 and 1983-84respectively.14. The relationship between the changes in finance provided to nationalisedindustries (EFLs) and the level of their capital investment is of course by nomeans a direct one.    In terms of fixed investment, my proposals to limit theincrease in the nationalised industry EFLs to  1,180 million in 1982-83 willprobably mean that such investment will be little different in total that yearfrom what was provided for in the last White Paper.(d) &quot;Validation of Inflation&quot;15. We have already decided not to attribute any of the increases which maybe made in the provision in local authority current expenditure to the continuingeffect of price increases above 11 per cent during the current year or payincreases above 6 per cent, except in the case of the police.    For them Ipropose adding to the programmes provision for the continuing cost in lateryears of this year&apos;s settlement over the 6 per cent factor.    The ArmedForces pay increase should be treated in the same way.    But we should notallow for the carry forward of any other pay settlements in excess of the 6 percent factor.    The experience of price movements during the current year doesnot justify carrying forward any extra costs on that account.(e) Future Relative Price Movements16. The only case where there is sufficient evidence so far that futureprice movements affecting a particular block of expenditure are likely to beso significantly higher than average as to warrant our deciding now to makeincreased provision for them is health.     But I am proposing a policy reductionthat more than offsets this.17. The Secretary of State for Social Services is bidding for additionalcash for National Health Service pay.    I propose that the Implication of thisfor pay policy should be considered by the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy, Sub-Committee on Public Sector Pay before we take a view on4SECRET
SECRETwhether to allow extra, and if so at what stage.    I have allowed  100 millionfor it provisionally in the totals.18. Where pay increases are recommended by Pay Review Boards orarbitration, we shall have to consider at the time both how far suchrecommendations can be accepted and how far excess increases which areagreed can be absorbed within existing programmes or should be financed byadditional cash allocation, which would be a charge on the contingency reserve.(f)        General Cut In Administrative Expenditure and Other Cash Limits19. The prospect for inflation has worsened since the inflation factorswere chosen in September.    Their effect is now likely to be a volume squeezein 1982-83 on non-pay elements of 1 per cent or a little more.    The factorswere put forward in good faith on the information available at the time, andwere not thus designed to have that effect.     But in the present circumstances,I must draw the changed prospects to my colleagues&apos; attention and specificallyask them not to se k a cash adjustment.20. In addition, as will be apparent from Annex A, I propose cashreductions, compared with the White Paper as revalued, in virtually all cash-limited programmes, except defence, universities and prisons.    I proposecutting all staff and general administrative expenditure by 2 per cent from theWhite Paper revalued.    In the case of programmes involving other types ofexpenditure, I propose a variety of specific and general cuts (included in thedetails given to individual Ministers) amounting to at least 2 per cent in thecase of each programme.21. I think it is right that we should bear severely on central governmentsalaries and general administrative expenditure, and encourage the NationalHealth Service and local authorities to do the same.    In this connection I drawthe attention of colleagues to the report published by the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) in September on ways of reducing Governmentexpenditure, particularly costs of manpower.    The CBI study supports theGovernment&apos;s own policy of reducing the costs of public administration;especially relevant is the evidence of the experience of private sectorcompanies that force of circumstances has often brought about manpowersavings previously judged by those concerned to be impracticable, and thatthose savings have subsequently been seen to be tolerable.OTHER POINTS(a)        Local Authorities22. We decided on 24 September that the Secretary of State for theEnvironment should have authority to discuss with local authority leaders themeans of securing the maximum feasible reduction in real expenditure nextyear; (CC(81) 32 Conclusions, Item 4).    He will shortly be reporting to us.Meanwhile, for internal purposes Departments are working on the basis of atotal addition to cash programmes, compared with the White Paper revalued,5SECRET
SECRETwhich implies total reductions in volume terms of 7 per cent, 4 per cent or3 per cent.     Pending our decision on whatever the Secretary of State may-propose, my proposals for Departments allow for the highest of these threelevels, a volume reduction of 3 per cent, implying cash expenditure in 1982-83some  850 million higher (GB) than allowed for in the White Paper revalued.The allocation to individual programmes is on the basis agreed in MISC 21.23. We must maintain the pressure on local authorities to reduceexpenditure, so that over a period of years they come back closer to the levelof expenditure earlier envisaged.    I propose that the provision for localauthority current expenditure in 1983-84 and 1984-85 should be increased fromthe White Paper revalued only to the extent necessary to allow for a 2 percent fall in real terms each year, if we decide on the highest level of the threeoptions for this year.24. Even allowing for a change in programme figures on grounds ofrealism, local authorities will still probably overspend them to some extent.This is partly because of the difficulty in cutting some types ofexpenditure quickly, partly because of the limited impact of the new legislation,important though that is, and partly because, unless we cut the Rate SupportGrant (RSG) percentage substantially, local authorities will have considerablescope for increasing expenditure in 1982-83 beyond what we provide for in ourpresent discussions without increasing their rates by more than the rate ofinflation.    I regard it as essential that the RSG percentage next year shouldbe reduced substantially to reinforce the effects of the forthcoming legislation,and prevent local authorities actually increasing spending further withoutmaking a significant increase in their rates.    My allowances for their over-spend are on the basis that the percentage of RSG will be cut in this way: if itis not the overspend could be considerably greater.(b)Economic Assumptions25. The proposals in this paper use the same economic assumptions forunemployment and interest rates as in the March White Paper.     The priceassumptions are in line with the inflation factors: 9 per cent (non-pay) for thechange to 1982-83, and 6 per cent and 5 per cent respectively for the followingtwo years.    The latest economic prospect is that we will have to allow, inestimating the costs for demand-led programmes, for slightly higherunemployment, higher interest rates and higher prices.    The programmesaffected will have to be adjusted for this on the best assumption which we canmake when we come to settle the White Paper.    It seems undesirable to adjustthe actual programmes now on this account, and again in a few months&apos; time.I have accordingly included in the totals, but not in the specific programmes,an &quot;estimating allowance&quot; for this and for the local authority overspendreferred to above of  2.1 billion in 1982-83 and  4. 0 billion in 1983-84.26. The substantially higher figure for 1983-84 is because of the November1982 social security uprating. It now seems certain that we will have to makegood then the under-provision this year: the Retail Price Index (RPI) will be1 to 2 per cent higher this November than the 10 per cent annual increaseallowed for in fixing the 1981 uprating.    Further, the annual increase in theSECRET
SECRETRPI to November 1982 will be higher than the 9 per cent factor allowed for inthe revaluation: as noted above the general level of price increases now appearslikely to be somewhat higher than 9 per cent, and the increase in the RPI willprobably be somewhat greater than that in prices generally.TIMING AND ANNOUNC EMENT27. If we are to get the RSG settlement made before Christmas, so that thenew legislation on local authority rates has a better chance of affecting localauthority expenditure next year, we need to decide the provision in programmesfor local authority current expenditure in 1982-83 on 29 October.    The timingof the disclosure of that decision to local authority associations, and itsannouncement, would then be for the Secretary of State for the Environment.28. For the rest we must complete our decisions, at least for 1982-83,by mid-November.    &quot;We need to tell nationalised industries their EFLs thenif they are to affect pay negotiation.    Departments and others need decisionsin order to prepare their Estimates and budgets for next year.    I propose that,as last year, the decisions for the coming year should be announced in broadterms, probably about 10 days after they are reached.    The full publicexpenditure White Paper would be published on Budget day.CONCLUSION29. I invite colleagues:i. to agree that the public expenditure allocation forDepartments for 1982-83 and 1983-84 should be as set out inTable 2, in order to keep the planning totals down to the levelsproposed in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paper C(81) 50;ii. to ask the Public Expenditure Survey Committee toproduce a report on the further policy or other initiativesrequired to achieve a substantial reduction in expenditurein 1984-85 compared with the figure in paragraph 2;iii. to agree that the EFLs for nationalised industries in1982-83 should be fixed as set out in paragraph 10 and Annex B;iv. to agree to the proposals for local authority currentexpenditure in later years in paragraph 23;v. to agree to the arrangements for announcements setout in paragraphs 27 and 28 above.L BTreasury Chambers14 October 19817SECRET

Smaller cuts are also possible on overseas representation and information and other externalservices ( 10 million in 1982-83). (These cuts aU imply a reduction in the cash limits.)

And I agree that we should accept the forecastcost of implementing the Common Fisher ies Policy ( 20 million in 1982 83). In the event of noagreement on the CFP, if there were any national measures of assistance to the fishing industry,these would have to be financed within the amount available for CFP measures.A significant offset to the substantial increases must be made, by cutting the rates of capitalgrant to farmers ( 30 million in 1982-83) by reducing expenditure on land drainage ( 8 million in982-83) and by cuts in research etc ( 9 million in 1982-83). This will mean some cuts in cash&apos;ttnted expenditure, possibly in the case of land drainage including a small element of localauthority capital.   The cuts in capital grants are mainly in respect of long-term schemes, soagricultural productivity should not be affected in the short-term.!j ain not prepared to accept the bid for hill livestock compensatory allowances ( 53 million in,  2-83). There is no clear evidence about the latest incomes of hill farmers, but following the&apos;Production of the EC sheepmeat regime, their position should be substantially eased byc mParison with the last two years, when it was necessary to provide exceptional increases in theowances. Nor can I accept the bids for additional provision for marketing and capital grantslt2 million and  30 million respectively in 1982-83).% Proposal to cut the rate and/or coverage of capital grants to farmers will require, for the mostP^t) affirmative resolution orders.

Some further increases seem justified, but not on thescale suggested by the Secretary of State: although the bids have been reduced, next year wouldbe nearly 26 per cent higher than this. We have to allow for increased costs of existing policies( 290 million next year). The only major further initiative should be the comprehensive YouthOpportunities Programme. But its introduction should be deferred; the rising cost of theProgramme should be limited by reducing the rate of allowance to  8 a week and by making therelevant age group ineligible for Supplementary Benefit from September 1983. We should alsomake further savings mainly by phasing out the Temporary Short-time Working CompensationScheme by April 1984 ( 67 million in 1984-85) and holding back increases in allowances as far aspossible ( 25 million in 1982-83). The cost of relieving overcrowding in unemployment benefitoffices ( 4 million in 1982-83) should be met by a transfer from this programme to the PSAProgramme.y proposal to make those who leave school at the minimum leaving age, and are within a year ofso, ineligible for supplementary benefit will require legislation.

We cannot accept furtherbids on top of this but should look for such offsets as seems feasible. An increase in parentalcontributions to student awards ( 40 million in 1982-83 and  100 million in 1983-84), and a 5%^auction in the 1982 uprating of those awards, would produce some savings ( 40 million in 1982-and  100 million in 1983-84), and a small cut could be made in cash limited expenditure otherthan for universities ( 19 million in 1982-83).

There is also provision in the baseline for 3 per cent a year volumegrowth in the Family Practitioner Services.We should be able to achieve net savings from increased efficiency ( 27 million in 1982-83 risingto  142 million in 1984-85) as offered by the Secretary of State, by raising existing NHS charges,by introducing some new charges. It also seems probable that demand determined expenditureon the Family Practitioner Services may grow by rather less than 3 per cent. I propose, inEdition, that we should provide cash which is expected to be sufficient to keep the volume ofexpenditure on the hospital services at its expected 1981-82 level, from 1982-83 onwards.The proposed introduction for health includes a maximum extra amount of  100 million in respectof NHS pay. This is subject to further discussion with colleagues.The introduction of new charges which I propose would require primary legislation.

(The Official Committee on the Value ofPensions has now reported on the possibility of changes in the value of our contributions to publicservice pensions, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster are considering its advice; this may lead to further public expenditure savings.)

This&quot;tight be achieved by a further reduction of, say,  50m in current costs (including pay&apos;&quot;here the industry is assuming an 8% increase in earnings in this pay round) and areduction of some  l50m in capital requirements to be split between lower working capita^d further reductions in the industry&apos;s  1.4 billion investment programme.
