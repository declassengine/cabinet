SECRET\DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 33 COPY NO      g 116 June 1981CABINETTHE DEFENCE PROGRAMMEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. I support the general appioach of the Secretary of State for Defence&apos;sReview.     It is unquestionably right to tackle the present massive over-commitment on the defence programme, and to develop more cost-effectiveforce structures.2. But the bill presented in C(81) 31 is still too high:  its proposals entailmassive increases in planned defence expenditure.    The/ contrast starkly withour overall economic policies, and specifically with their critical publicexpend!txir e c ompon ent.3. The modification which I suggest below, and which is also touched on inC(81) 31, would still involve allocating more resources to defence than I wouldwish rn economic grounds.    I should be prepared to accept it as a compro-mise, and with a view to achieving the stability in future defence planning atwhich, like the Secretary of State for Defence, I believe we should aim.BACKGROUND4. Defence spending has risen sharply since we took office.    Its burdenon national resources - as measured by volume expenditure derived fromgeneral indices - is already at a post-war peak.    The C(81) 31 proposals, castin volume terms (cash figures can be found at Appendix J), are for furthergrowth of either;-a. 3 per cent a year, plus  200 million (1979 prices) a year up to1985-86, iR over four years a volume increase of 16 per cent (in cashover 50 per cent, on present assumptions); orb. 3 per cent a year in volume terms up to 1987-88, a volumeincrease over six years of 19 per cent (in cash over 80 per cent, onpresent assumptions).1SECRET
SECRET5. On either option, defence&apos;s share of Gross Domestic Product wouldrise from 5.2 to 5. 9 per cent, a levsl not reached since the early &apos;60s, a timeof majOi- world-wide deployments, and United Kingdom bases in Malta, Aden,Bahrain and Singapore.     Even at 5. 2 per cent, it is notably higher than thoseof our major European Allies, ie France (4 per cent), Germany (3. 3 per cent)and Italy (2. 3 per cent).THE LONG TERM6. It is not realistic to plan now for continuing major increases in defencespending to or beyond the mid-80s.     This is simply to court a repetition of theover-commitment which the Secretary of State for Defence rightly hopes toeliminate.7. Defence cannot be insulated from all economic fluctuations in the nextdecade.    To plan on the basis of 3 per cent growth to 1987-88, or for evenmore rapid growth to 1985-86, would only guarantee that there will have to be afurther Defenre Review before then.8. I suggest that it would be prudent for the Secretary of State for Defenceto adjust the core defence programme to ensure that it can be sustained withoutfurther increases in resources in the mid-80s.THE SURVEY PERIOD9. Our most immediate concern must be for the Survey period. Beforeconsidering the C(81) 31 proposals, Cabinet will have discussed the prospectsfor achieving in this Parliament our financial and economic objectives,notably reductions in inflation, in the burden of taxation, in the size of thepublic sector, and in interest rates.    We shall have noted the criticalimportance of reductions in the total public expenditure plans we published inour last White Paper (Cmnd 8175), and the incompatibility of our tax andinterest rate objectives with increases in these plans.10. Defence represents 13 per cent of total public expenditure. Theexemption sought in C(81) 31 would increase by that amount the reductions inother planned programmes which we must achieve in the Survey.11. As I see it, our tax and interest rate objectives require that either: -a. we refuse the exemption sought for defence from Surveyreductions; orb. we grant it, but agree that it will mean correspondingly largerreductions in other programmes.2SECRET
SECRET12. Obvicusly I should prefer a. , but I could accept b. This would confirmthe published Cmnd 8175 defence figures which provide for 3 per cent growth in1982-83 and 1983-84, and would be consistent with our North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation (NATO) and other pledges. In fact it has always been accepted inNATO that national economic circumstances may necessitate shortfalls againstthe 3 per cent target - an escape clause of which other Allies have madefrequent use.13. The second choice is whether: -a. to refuse the increases sought for defence on the Cmnd 8175figures for the Survey period; orb. to allow them, but agree that still further reductions (ie beyondthose consequent upon maintaining the existing defence figures) mustfall on other programmes.14. Both or the Secretary of State for Defence&apos;s options call for a further3 per cent increase in 1984-85:  the first also apparently requires - forpolitical not financial reasons - an extra  200 million (1979 prices) in eachSurvey year.    I muct oppose these increases.    I question the politicaladvantage in demonstrating to those as yet agnostic about Trident that - con-trary to what we have so far said - its costs will not be contained within theplanned (Cmnd 8175) defence programme but will be at the expense of etherprogrammes.    Moreover, budgetary and other decisions affecting onespending programme in the last years of this Parliament cannot be madewithout regard to other public expenditure plans for 1984-85 and thereafter.If defence is to go up again in 1984-85, we shall have to have published plans toreduce other programmes at least commensurately.15. My view at the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee (OD) was thatCabinet colleagues might agree to meet the costs of exempting defence fromany reductions on the Cmnd 8175 figures, but would not countenance furtherincreases on them.    Hence the option which I put to OD and which isdescribed in C(81) 31:   3 per cent growth next year and in 1983-84, constantreal defence spending thereafter, and no additional Trident tranche.CASH PLANNING16. Cabinet has agreed that future public expenditure plans should be incash;  and so is my proposal, the substantive version of which is atAppendix J to C(81) 31.    We must take our decisions in cash subject only to thereview of the general inflation factors this autumn.    For 1982-83 we muststick to these decisions regardless of what happens to costs, as do our NATOpartners, and as we shall do for all other spending programmes.    The cashprovision for defence - as for all other programmes - for the later yearswould of course be open to discussion in future Surveys.3SECRET
SECRET17. In converting h; s volume proposals to cash the Secretary of State forDefence has assumed that defence costs will rise by 2 per cent a year morethan costs in the economy as a whole.    This could happen, if Forces pay wereto continue to rise steeply, or if the Relative Price Effect (RPE) on defenceprocurement were to revert to the pattern of the mid-70s.    But the costs ofdefence procurement have recently been rising more jlowly than other publicsector costs, while the patter_i. even in the mid-70s, was one of sharpfluctuations.    There is therefore no basis for assuming a 2 per cent positiveRPE throughout the &apos;80s.    It will be open to Cabinet to review the defencefigures, and the RPE prospects, in each successive Survey.18. We should also be clear about one important impHcetion of the move tocash planning as it affects defence.    Hitherto, as a consequence of volumeplanning, combined with our pledge to keep Service pay in line with that ofcivilian counterparts, we have adjusted defence cash limits to provide for theadditional costs of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) recommen-dations.     The Government&apos;s future stance on Armed Forces pay is a matterfor future decision in the light of the Secretary of State for Defence&apos;s view ofthe relative priority to be attached to different parts of the defenceprogramme.    We shall need in these circumstances to reconsider thepractice of recent years whereby the agreed cash provision for the defenceprogramme has been automatically adjusted to accommodate whatever payincreases the AFPRB have proposed.THE CURRENT YEAR19. Paragraphs 5 and 12 of C(81) 31 re&apos;er to difficulties with the defencecash limits in the current year.    It was from the outset envisaged that thelimits would be reviewed:  adjustments (in opposite directions but of similarsize) are required on account of Forces pay and the need to offset the 1980-81overspend.     The evidence on price and exchange rate movements is beingexamined at official level, and proposals for the revision or confirmation ofthe defence cash limrt will be put to Cabinet as soon as defence provides thenecessary dat?,.    We are not yet in a position to take decisions.20. But there can be no question of an inci ease commensurate with the 500 million potential cash overspend to which the Secretary of State forDefence has referred.    A threat on this scale must spring from an inflatedvolume programme, and as such must be countered at once.    I thereforeentirely agree with the Secretary of State for Defence that the necessarymeasures should Le announced forthwith.      Defence have yet to identify thefull volume reductions required by our autumn decisions on the 1980 Survey.CONCLUSIONS21. I accordingly invite Cabinet to agree:-4SECRET
SECRETa. That the core defence programme should be made consistent withconstant defence expenditure after the Survey period (paragraphs 6-8above).b. That within the Survey period, the costs of exempting defencefrom any reductions on the Cmnd 8175 figures should be met from otherprogrammes (paragraph 1Z above).c. That any increases above the Cmnd 8175 figures would similarlyentail commensurate reductions in other programmes (paragraph 13above).d. That such increases should not however be agreed (paragraphs 14and 15 above) e. That the planned future cash provision for defence should, in linewith Cmnd 8175, be as set out in Column 3 at Appendix J to C(81) 31, thefigurei for the years after 1982-83 being subject to review in futureSurveys (paragraphs 16-18 above).f. That the current review of the 1981-82 defence cash limits, andwhatever measures may be necessary to bring the volume of lQ81-82defence spending in line with Cabinet&apos;s decisions in November 1980,should be completed as soon as possible (paragraphs 19 and 20 above).G HTreasury Chambers16 June 19815SECRET
