CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(8x) 40 COPY NO 8 120 July 1981CABINETLOCAL AUTHORITIES&apos; CURRENT EXPENDITURE 1982-83 (ENGLAND)Note by the Secretary of State for the Environment1. The Chief Secretary&apos;s paper C(81) 38 proposes that the localauthorities should be given early advice on the level of current expenditurefor which to plan in 1982-83.    I agree that early advice is desirable as it isour best hope of influencing local authorities&apos; budget decisions for 1982-83.Such advice needs to be as clear as possible about what we expect as regardsboth the cash and volume of current expenditure and about including provisionfor past and future increases in pay and prices.    Advice could be given atthe 4 August meeting of the Consultative Council on Local GovernmentFinance.2. But I have serious reservations about the substance of the adviceproposed in C(81) 38.    Local government; has made significant reductions inthe volume of current expenditure since we came to power.    In real termsexpenditure may be 3-4 per cent less in 1981-82 than in 1979-80 (1 per cent isequivalent to about  150 million at November 1980 prices).    In 1982-83 weneed to eliminate a possible volume excess of about 3-4 per cent this yearand achieve the further 1 per cent volume reduction proposed in Cmnd 8175.The proposals in C(81) 38, however, go much further by seeking to carryforward the squeeze which comes from pay settlements and price inflationin 1981-82 turning out higher than originally predicted.    This squeeze isunlikely to be less than 3 per cent and would increase the real level ofreductions sought to some 7 per cent below the possible 1981-82 outturn, or -in the terms which local authorities would consider it - over 9 per cent belowtheir original budgets for 1981-82.    The volume of cuts required will ofcourse be increased, to the extent that inflation factors used for 1982-83 areset below the likely levels of inflation.3. I should emphasise a basic problem about trying to secure rapidreductions in local government expenditure.    With local government costsbeing 70 per cent manpower, a 7 per cent expenditure reduction would implya manpower reduction of 200, 000 full time equivalents by the end of 1982-83.This must mean redundancies on a large scale; and depending on theredundancy entitlements and their timing in the year it is likely that thiswould lead to an increased cost in the first year, which could wipe out a1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsubstantial part of the savings on the salaries bill.    This would makereductions on the scale envisaged unattainable in a single year,4. As the implications of cuts of this scale and magnitude become clearthere is every prospect of losing the support and cooperation of even thoseauthorities which have so far done all we asked by meeting their volumetargets (and in many cases spending below their grant-related expenditureas well).    By asking for more we might well get less.    We might forfeiteven the 4 per cent savings which I judge to be the most we can realisticallyseek, and local authorities would plan to finance the overspend by bigincreases in rates and increased borrowing.5. In view of all these points I believe that we must give local governmenta more realistic target for 1982-83, by recognising the pay and price move-ments that have already taken place in the baseline for 1982-83.    Indeed theLocal Government Planning and Land Act 1980 obliges me to take account ofthe current level ot prices, costs and remuneration when making the RateSupport Grant (RSG) settlement.    I do not think, however, this need endangerthe principles of cash planning which I fully support.    The squeeze imposedby the cash limit this year has already had a significant effectinthe currentyear.    In the transitional stage of moving to the new cash planning system iiis not necessary or desirable to comnound this effect by building in this year&apos;scash limit factors into next year&apos;s baseline.    Indeed to impose very steepvolume reductions under the guise of the move to cash planning can onlyendanger the cash planning system itself right at the outset.6. Our assumption about the appropriate level of cash expenditure bylocal authorities has important implications for the distribution of block grant.The nature of the block grant system - which relates grant to the actual levelof spending - is such that our decision on the politically important question ofthe distribution of grant as between authorities can be completely distorted ifwe consciously plan on a level of local government expenditure in 1982-83which we know cannot be achieved.    For example, last December weannounced that London would lose  107 million of grant on the basis of theRSG settlement assumptions about expenditure and pay and prices.    On theiractual badgets they stand to lose  216 miUion.    The problem gets worse thegreater the discrepancy between our plans and actual inflation.7. If we agree to acknowledge the existing level of pay and prices, I shallconsider further how best to achieve the 4 per cent volume saving alreadymentioned by applying the pressures available to us in the block grant system.I think it likely that we shall need to set targets for individual authorities.To be effective these must be set so that authorities with sufficient determin-ation can achieve them.    At the same time they should recognise the effortsmade by many authorities co achieve the savings sought.CONCLUSION8         I agree with the Chief Secretary that we should give early advice tolocal government on the implications of the Government&apos;s expenditure plansCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfor the volume of current expenditure for which they should be planning in1982-83.    The advice should point to the reduction in volume from 1981-82to 1982-83 needed to eliminate the volume excess in the current year, andallow lor the 1 per cent planned reduction contained in Cmnd 8175. Irecommend, however, that we should not go further to seek a further 3 percent reduction to offset the excess of pay and price increases in 1981-82 sincethis additional reduction could not be achieved, and would discredit cashplanning.    At the same time we should give as good guidance as possible atthis stage about future increases in pay and prices.9. If this recommendation is agreed I propose to make a generalannouncement on these lines to the Consultative Council on Local GovernmentFinance on 4 August.    I shall not at that stage be able to give them preciseservice figures in either volume or cash terms because bilaterals on localgovernment expenditure programmes will not by then have taken place. Itis, however, important that we shouldfollow up the impact of an earlyannouncement by taking detailed decisions on local authority programmes assoon as possible in the Public Expenditure Survey round, and sticking to ourtarget of a November RSG settlement, so that we can influence the ratingdecisions of local government in good time.    If we are to meet this timetabledetailed decisions on local authority programmes, current and capital, willbe needed in September.MHDepartment of the Environment20 July 19813CONFIDENTIAL
