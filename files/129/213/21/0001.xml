SECTION I: INTRODUCTION1.1 The period covered by this White Paper is that of the NetherlandsPresidency from 1 January to 30 June 1981. It also corresponds to thefirst six months of Greek membership; the Hellenic Republic became thetenth Member State on 1 January 1981. It was marked by solid achieve-ment in a number of areas of Community policy and steady progresstowards the attainment of the reforms which the Community last year setitself to bring about in the course of 1981.1.2 Two agreements attracted particular attention. One related tocommon agricultural prices and was concluded in April. It included anumber of measures of benefit to United Kingdom producers and consumers,as well as measures to assist in restraining the future costs of the CommonAgricultural Policy (CAP) and was notable for the speed with which itwas concluded.1.3 The other agreement concerned arrangements on steel productionand prices and was concluded in June. It represents a considerable ifhard won success for co-operation between the members of the Communityand the Commission in the face of difficult circumstances involving whatis still a major industry in many countries. Without the recognition thatit was only by determining upon painful measures in common that theindustry could be protected from the effects of declining prices and increasingcompetition for a limited market, the European steel industry wouldcertainly have been doomed to become a major burden on taxpayers inthe Community.1.4 The Government continued to seek a satisfactory overall settle-ment of the revised Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). However, progresswas limited, partly because of national elections in several Member States.1.5 The period was marked by two major preoccupations whichaffected all Member States and coloured many of the Council discussions.These were increasing unemployment throughout the Community and thethreat of certain forms of external competition to a number of industries.These questions were considered at both the European Councils held duringthe period at Maastricht on 23-24 March and Luxembourg on 29-30 June.A joint Council of Ministers chiefly involved was held in June to giveparticular attention to the problems of unemployment. On the trade side,relations with Japan continued to give serious concern, and the continueddeterioration in the Community&apos;s balance of trade with Japan was thesubject of a statement by the Foreign Affairs Council in May. Discussiontook place with the United States on the problems created for Communitytextile and chemical industries by increased imports from the United States.1.6 The Community continued to make progress towards achievementof its energy objectives of reduced dependence on oil and of energy savings.It examined the possibilities for mutual aid during a short-fall of oilsupplies, and for aid for energy investments; and re-emphasised theimportance of economic pricing principles.1.7 Although work on the major issues is at an early stage, progresscontinued towards negotiating the terms of entry for Spain and Portugal;agreement is close in some areas.4
1.8 Political cooperation between the Member States continued to bean important activity, and the Foreign Ministers of the Ten had a numberof meetings. Mr van der Klaauw as President of the Council of Ministersundertook a round of visits in the Middle East and reported to the EuropeanCouncil. The Community also launched an initiative for an Afghanistanconference.1.9 Towards the end of the period, attention in the Community wasagain turned towards change and reform, and the task which Ministershad set themselves and the Commission at the meeting of the ForeignAffairs Council on 30 May 1980. As agreed then, the Commissionproduced in June their report which now provides the basis for thenegotiation on the future shape of the Community budget. The report wasgiven preliminary consideration by the European Council at Luxembourgand a programme of work for the autumn was agreed. The report clearlyrecognises both that the UK&apos;s budgetary situation is inequitable and mustbe corrected and that changes must be made to improve the operation ofthe CAP. It proposes ways of accomplishing these two objectives as wellas for developing the Community&apos;s non-agricultural policies. The Govern-ment consider that the Community budget should be better balancedbetween the various policies and that a lasting method should be found toensure that no Member State again faces an unacceptable budgetary burden.The Commission report does not cover this ground as widely as theGovernment would have liked and in particular does not sufficientlyrecognise that the net contributions problem is one for the Communityas a whole and not just the United Kingdom. But the Government viewit as an important first step towards long term reform of the budget structure,and towards the early fulfilment of the pledges contained in the 30 Mayagreement.SECTION II:  POLITICAL CO-OPERATION2.1 The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, and other ForeignMinisters, have repeated their view that in an unstable world the machineryof Political Co-operation needs strengthening. Officials have been studyinghow this might be done. Suggestions put forward for consideration includerenewed political commitment, an improved emergency procedure, a smallpermanent staff, and the extension of Political Co-operation to includecultural matters and political aspects of security.Middle East2.2 Building on the earlier tour by M Thorn, Mr van der Klaauw,the Netherlands Foreign Minister (in his capacity as President of the Councilof Ministers) made a round of visits in the Middle East, on which hereported to the European Council on 29-30 June.   They concluded that513523 b*
the efforts of the Ten to promote a peaceful settlement should continue,and that Ministers should elaborate further the practical possibilitiesavailable.2.3 The Council endorsed the United Nations Security Council&apos;sunanimous resolution on the Israeli attack on the Iraqi nuclear plant.Afghanistan2.4 At its meeting on 29-30 June the European Council recalled thatthey had previously stressed the urgent need to bring about a solutionwhich would enable Afghanistan to return to its traditional independentand non-aligned status. As a fresh attempt to open the way to a politicalsolution, the Council formally put forward, as an initiative of the Ten, theBritish proposal for a two-stage international conference on Afghanistan.Stage One of the conference would be attended by the Permanent Membersof the Security Council, Pakistan, India, Iran, the United Nations Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the Islamic Conference; Stage Twowould in addition be attended by representatives of the Afghan people.2.5 The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary subsequently visitedMoscow to explain this proposal to the Soviet Government.Poland2.6 The Ten followed developments in and around Poland with dueattention. At the European Council meeting in Maastricht on 23-24 Marchthey recalled their earlier statement of 2 December 1980 and underlinedthe obligation of all states signatory to the Helsinki Final Act to basetheir relations with Poland on the strict application of the United NationsCharter and the principles of the Final Act. They noted that they weredisposed, within the limits of their means and in collaboration with others,to continue their contribution to the recovery of the Polish economy, andcalled upon the Commission and the Council, in agreement with partnercountries which were already taking part in the Paris discussions, to examinePolish needs for extra food as soon as possible (see paragraph 3.5.).The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)2.7 The Ten consulted closely on aims and tactics for the CSCEmeeting during the first half of the year, and were active both in ensuringa proper review of implementation in those areas of traditional interestto Europe, such as human rights and contacts, and in pressing for agree-ment on the French proposal for a Conference on Disarmament in Europe.Euro-Arab Dialogue2.8 Following the resumption of the Euro-Arab Dialogue at themeeting between representatives of the Nine and the Arab League on12-13 November 1980, the various working groups on economic, financialand cultural co-operation were reconvened and resumed work on a widerange of technical issues.6
Terrorism2.9 As part of the Community&apos;s programme for co-operation againstterrorism, senior officials met in The Hague in June to consider reportsfrom Working Groups.SECTION III: ENLARGEMENT, EXTERNAL RELATIONS,TRADE AND AIDEnlargement3.1 The Community welcomed Greece as its tenth member on 1 January1981. Negotiations on Portuguese and Spanish accession continued.Position papers have now been exchanged on almost all aspects of thenegotiations. In a number of the more technical dossiers provisionalagreement is close and a good start has been made on some of the moresubstantive issues.Textiles3.2 Under the terms of the Multifibre Arrangement bilateral agreementswith low-cost supplier countries, a further six new quotas on textile andclothing products were introduced. The Voluntary Restraint Arrangementswith Spain and Tunisia were extended to cover 1981. Preliminary discussionhas begun within the Community and with the low-cost supplier countries onthe renewal of the Multifibre Arrangement when the present Arrangementexpires at the end of 1981.Synthetic Textiles3.3 A series of discussions took place between the Community and theUnited States Administration on the problems caused by increased importsof textiles and certain chemicals; and the Council received a number ofreports from the Commission on these discussions. An important elementin the situation was the removal by the United States Administration ofthe controls on oil prices. The Community maintained pressure on theUnited States to accelerate the de-control of natural gas prices. In additionseven anti-dumping duties on United States chemicals and textiles wereimposed and a number of further products were under investigation.Japan3.4 During their visit to Europe in June, Mr Suzuki, the JapanesePrime Minister, and Mr Tanaka, the Minister for International Trade andIndustry, said that they would be issuing a declaration that Japan wouldexpand imports from the Community and would encourage the private sectorto co-operate in this. Mr Tanaka also announced that Japanese car exportsto the Community in 1981 would be moderate and that there would be nodiversion of Japanese cars to the Community as a result of measures takenby Japan regarding the United States and Canada.713523b*2
Poland3.5 On 1 April the Foreign Affairs Council agreed to make furthersupplies of Community foodstuffs, in particular barley, beef and butter,available to Poland at special prices (an average discount of 15 per cent fromworld prices). On 7 May, the Council agreed to a supplementary package,consisting largely of animal feedstuffs, on the same conditions.Romania3.6 On 1 January the Industrial Products Agreement (IPA) and theJoint Committee Agreement (JCA) between the Community and Romaniacame into force. The IPA is intended to develop trade and economicrelations between the Community and Romania, and recognises theimportance of industrial products in the expansion of trade. The JCAestablishes a Joint Committee which will meet, normally annually, to monitorand discuss the development of trade between the signatories.Second Lome Convention3.7 The Second Lome Convention came into force on 1 January. Workon implementation is now under way.Zimbabwe Accession to the Second Lome Convention3.8 On 1 January an Interim Agreement between the Community andZimbabwe, under which Zimbabwe benefits from all the trade provisions ofthe Second Lome Convention, came into force. Ratification procedures forthe agreement on the accession of Zimbabwe to the Second Lome Conventionare now under way.African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP)-EC Joint Council ofMinisters3.9 The annual meeting of the ACP-EC Joint Council of Ministers,provided for under the Lome Convention, was held in Luxembourg on9-10 April. The Council reviewed the progress made in the implementationof the Second Lome Convention and set guidelines for the further implemen-tation of the new Convention.EC-Gulf3.10 As part of the Community&apos;s policy of strengthening relations withthe Arab States, an informal and exploratory Community mission visitedthe Yemen Arab Republic in February to discuss possible future co-operation.EC/India Commercial and Economic Co-operation Agreement3.11 A new wide-ranging Co-operation Agreement was signed inLuxembourg between the Community and India on 23 June. It replaces theEC/India Commercial Co-operation Agreement of 1975, and will providea firm basis for the development of a closer relationship in the mutualinterest of both sides.8
Joint Committees3.12 Joint bilateral meetings as provided by the various CommercialCo-operation Agreements were held with senior representatives from India,Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. These meetings discussed tradeproblems, trade promotion, utilisation of the Community&apos;s GeneralisedScheme of Preferences (GSP), the Community aid programme and othermatters of bilateral concern.Latin American Dialogue3.13 A meeting between Permanent Representatives of CommunityMember States and Latin American Ambassadors accredited to theEuropean Communities, constituting the &quot; Group of Latin AmericanAmbassadors &quot; (GRULA), was held in Brussels on 17 June, continuing on26 June. This marked the resumption of the EC /Latin American Dialogue,which had been in abeyance for over a year. The meeting dealt in depthwith Community and Latin American concerns over energy (particularly thedevelopment of new and renewable forms), trade and textiles.Morocco3.14 On 17 June there was a meeting of the EC/Morocco Co-operationCommittee in Brussels to review recent developments in the implementationof the EC/Morocco Co-operation Agreement of 1976 and discuss theeffect of Spanish and Portuguese accession on Morocco&apos;s trade with theCommunity. The Community agreed that there should be further informedcontacts between the Moroccan authorities and the Commission aboutMoroccan concerns.Malta3.15 There was a meeting of the EC/Malta Association Council,provided for in the EC/Malta Association Agreement of 1970, inLuxembourg on 22 June. The Maltese delegation was led by the PrimeMinister, Mr Dom Mintoff. There was a wide ranging discussion of thefuture of EC/Malta relations and the Community committed itself to theprinciple of a second financial protocol with Malta to enter into force whenthe current financial protocol runs out at the end of 1983.Yugoslavia3.16 Discussions continued on the terms of the Commission&apos;s mandateto negotiate an adaptation protocol to the EC/Yugoslavia Agreement totake account of Greek accession to the Community. The Community wasunable by the end of the period to agree on the quantity of Yugoslavbaby beef exports to be provided for in that mandate.Turkey3.17 Agreement was reached with Turkey on the amounts to be madeavailable to Turkey in the form of European Investment Bank loans andbudgetary aid under a fourth financial protocol to replace the existingprotocol which expires on 31 October.9
North/South3.18 The European Council on 29-30 June endorsed general guide-lines for the Community&apos;s approach to global negotiations and to thevarious international meetings dealing with North/South issues in the secondhalf of this year.Agricultural Exports to the USSR3.19 The Community continued, for the first four months of the year,to implement the Council Decision of 15 January 1980 to support theUnited States partial grain embargo by not replacing on the Soviet marketdirectly or indirectly those goods denied to the Soviet Union by the UnitedStates embargo. Once President Reagan lifted the United States embargoon 24 April, the basis for the Community&apos;s action was removed. TheCommunity therefore concluded on 30 April that the Decision of 15 January1980 should no longer apply. The Commission have however made cleartheir intention to maintain the arrangements made following the January1980 Decision to monitor Community agricultural exports to the USSR.They have also confirmed that they do not intend in present circumstancesto put forward proposals for sales of Community butter to the USSR, whichwere suspended in 1980.Mediterranean Financial Protocols3.20 Discussion continued on the details of the mandate for theCommission to negotiate new financial protocols with the Maghreb andMashraq countries and Israel to replace the present protocols, whichexpire in October.Aid to Non-Associated Developing Countries3.21 In February, the Council agreed a Regulation establishing as apermanent feature of Community development policy, aid to countriesnot covered by the Lome Convention or the Agreements with Mediterraneancountries.Stock-taking of Community Aid3.22 The Development Council on 28 April agreed a proposal forperiodic evaluation by Development Ministers on the effectiveness ofCommunity aid.Food Aid3.23 The 28 April Development Council approved the Community&apos;sfood aid programme for 1981 comprising cereals (1-65 million tonnes),milk powder (150,000 tonnes), butteroil (45,000 tonnes) and sugar (6,086tonnes).Investment Protection and Promotion3.24 The Development Council on 22 June adopted a consultationprocedure to enable Member States to make the most effective use of thenon-discrimination clauses on investment in Community co-operationagreements with third countries.10
Infra-Community Trade The Role of Standards and CertificationProcedures3.25 The Council are currently considering a proposal from theCommission laying down a procedure for the provision of informationin the field of technical standards and regulations. This is aimed atpreventing the creation of new technical barriers to trade by requiringMember States to declare at an early stage their intentions to draftstandards or draw up technical regulations over the whole area of industrialproducts. Where a potential technical barrier to trade is detected MemberStates would be requested to suspend work for a limited period on theparticular document in question to enable efforts to be made to alleviatethe problem.SECTION IV:   AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESThe Common Agricultural Policy Price Fixing4.1 The Commission&apos;s proposals for common prices in 1981-82 werepresented in February and a settlement was reached at the AgricultureCouncil on 30 March to 2 April. The average increase in common priceswas between 9 and 9   5 per cent. The overall average increase in institutionalprices is broadly in line with the rate of inflation in the Community. Theeffect of the settlement on food prices in the United Kingdom will be anincrease of about 1 per cent in a full year. This is equivalent to an increaseof less than % of 1 per cent in the retail price index.4.2 For milk, a 9 per cent increase in target price was partly offset byan increase in the co-responsibility levy from 2 to 2-5 per cent. It wasagreed that the 1981 budget appropriation for milk should not be exceededand that measures would be taken, if necessary, to limit surplus productionand contain budgetary costs.4.3 It was also agreed that the United Kingdom should retain aconsumer subsidy on butter, financed entirely from the Community budget,equivalent to 7 pence per 250 gram pack on butter sold for direct con-sumption. The continuation of the subsidy is of benefit to all UnitedKingdom consumers.4.4 A Regulation was adopted which authorises the United Kingdomto import 94,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter in 1981 and 92,000 tonnesin 1982 under special terms including a reduced import levy. To qualifyfor this reduced levy the butter must meet certain quality requirements, mustbe used only for direct consumption within the United Kingdom and mustnot be re-exported. The Regulation also provides for the determinationby 1 October 1982 by the Agriculture Council of the quantity of NewZealand butter which may be imported into the United Kingdom in 1983;and for a decision by the Council, on the basis of a report and proposalfrom the Commission, before 1 August 1983 on the arrangements to applyfrom 1 January 1984. The measures are acceptable to the New ZealandGovernment.11
4.5 For beef, the guide price was raised by 10 per cent in two stagesand the variable premium in the United Kingdom was retained, althoughwithin the UK the separate calculation for Northern Ireland was discon-tinued. The suckler cow premium was retained unchanged in Great Britainwhile in Northern Ireland the Community will finance a supplement whichdoubles the premium. A Regulation setting the form of the Communitycarcase classification grid for adult bovine animals was adopted.4.6 For sheepmeat, a 7-5 per cent increase in the basic price wasagreed.4.7 For cereals, the support prices for feed grains were increased by6 per cent and for breadmaking wheat by 5-5 per cent. Agreement wasreached to bring in co-responsibility measures in 1982-83. Agreementwas also reached on Regulations laying down rules for according refundsunder the Cereals Regulation in respect of Community cereals used in theproduction of exported whisky and other spirit drinks.4.8 For sugar, the basic beet price was increased by 8-5 per cent andintervention prices increased by 8 5 per cent for white and by 7-5 percent for raw sugar. A new regime for sugar and isoglucose for theperiod 1981-82 to 1985-86 was also agreed. The regime includes quotaslimiting the amount of production eligible for Community support andprovisions for covering the costs of sugar exports, except on a tonnageequal to ACP imports, by a levy on all Community-produced sugar. Thereis provision for reviewing quota levels after three years.Monetary Arrangements4.9 The Agriculture Council on 30 March-2 April prolonged until31 December 1981 the provisions prescribing the use of the EuropeanCurrency Unit (ecu) for CAP purposes. They also agreed to devalue thegreen currencies of Italy (5-6 per cent), Ireland (3-8 per cent), Greece(2-8 per cent), Denmark (2-5 per cent), France (2-5 per cent), Belgium-Luxembourg (0-2 per cent) and the Netherlands (0 2 per cent). Thesechanges avoided the need to introduce or increase negative monetarycompensatory amounts (i.e. those arising from the depreciation of a MemberState&apos;s currency against the ecu) which would otherwise have resulted fromthe realignment of the currencies of the European Monetary System decidedon 22 March. At the same meeting the German green currency was revaluedby 3   6 per cent (4   7 per cent in the case of the milk sector).Mutton and Lamb4.10 On 28 April, the Council approved voluntary restraint agreementswith Austria, Iceland, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia as part of theimport arrangements under the sheepmeat regime. On 12 May theAgriculture Council approved a voluntary restraint agreement with Hungary.Poultrymeat4.11 The Agriculture Council on 23 and 24 February agreed in principleto increases in the standard amount element of the sluicegate prices forturkeys, ducks and geese.  These were applied from 1 May.12
Structural Measures4.12 The Agriculture Council on 30 March/2 April agreed a packageof measures to restrict aid to investment in dairying and pig produc-tion and to make minor changes in the structures Directives 72/159and 72/161. The package also contains programmes for the develop-ment of agriculture in the less favoured areas of Northern Irelandand the French Overseas Departments; aid to improve the storage,treatment and processing of animal feed in Northern Ireland; integrateddevelopment programmes for the Western Isles of Scotland andparts of France and Belgium; aid for livestock production in the hill areasof Italy, for the improvement of rural infrastructure in certain less favouredareas of the Federal Republic of Germany and for the development ofbeef cattle production in Ireland and Northern Ireland.European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)4.13 United Kingdom receipts from the Guidance section of theEAGGF amounted to  43-9 million in the first six months of 1981 andincluded  5-7 million for individual projects under Regulation 17/64,projects under Regulation 355/77 on marketing and processing and Regula-tion 1852/78 as amended. United Kingdom receipts from the Guaranteesection of EAGGF for the first half of 1981 were  270-5 million.Animal Health and Welfare4.14 In April, the Commission submitted proposals intended to correctdistortions resulting from the wide differences in inspection levels andcharging practices being applied by Member States in implementingDirective 71/118 on poultry meat hygiene.4.15 The Agriculture Council on 15 June agreed in principle to putthe Standing Veterinary Committee on a permanent footing, subject topossible revision of the arrangements in six years&apos; time.4.16 By the end of the period there had been some progress on thequestion of controlling the use of hormones in animal husbandry andmedicine.4.17 On 12 May the Agriculture Council adopted a Directive whichdevelops the existing safeguards to protect the welfare of farm animalsduring international transport. Work has continued in the Commissionon the preparation of proposals for minimum welfare standards for egglaying hens kept in cages.FisheriesInternal Regime4.18 The Fisheries Council noted that Member States would, pendinga final decision on a revised Common Fisheries Policy, take conservationmeasures similar to those of previous years.4.19 Pending a settlement of the Common Fisheries Policy the periodof the conservation regime, under Council Regulation 2527 / 80 of September1980, was extended five times. It is now due to expire on 31 October1981.1313523c*
4.20 Several meetings of officials were held to discuss (he outstandingpoints on the draft control and enforcement regulation on which theCouncil had reached agreement in principle in October 1980. Althoughprogress was made, certain important points remain to be agreed beforethe draft regulation can be reconsidered by the Fisheries Council.External Regime4.21 Agreement was reached in the Fisheries Council for interimarrangements to allow Spanish and Norwegian fishermen to fish in thewaters of Member States and to regulate their activities. These were laterconsolidated into Regulations operative to the end of 1981.SECTION V :   ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND BUDGETARYQUESTIONSFinance Council Business5.1 Finance Ministers continued their regular reviews of the economicsituation in the Community. At the 16 February meeting, the Councilreached agreement on the renewal of the Community Loan Mechanismwhich allows the Community to borrow in the markets for on-lending toMember States in balance of payments difficulties as a result of oil priceincreases. The ceiling on the facility was agreed at 6 billion ecus (about 3-2 billion).05.2 The 16 March Finance Council resumed earlier discussion of theeconomic and financial aspects of the agricultural price fixing and con-sidered a draft directive on non life insurance services which would giveinsurers freedom to operate across frontiers within the Community. Thedraft directive was discussed further at the 15 June meeting, which alsoconsidered a Commission proposal for renewing the New CommunityInstrument which allows the Community to borrow in the markets foron-lending to investment projects in Member States.European Investment Bank5.3 In May the Board of Governors of the European Investment Bankdecided that with effect from 1 January 1981 the European Currency Unitwould be adopted for the presentation of the Bank&apos;s accounts. The ecuthus replaced the &quot; unit of account&quot; previously used, which was identicalto the ecu in all but name.5.4 At its meeting on 15 June the Board of Governors decided toincrease the capital of the Bank from 7   2 billion ecus (about  3   8 billionX1)to 14-4 billion ecus (about  7-6 billion).(&apos;) Member States will pay in7-5 per cent of the amount of this increase in eight equal half-yearlyinstalments, the first instalment falling due on 30 April 1984. In the caseof the United Kingdom the payments will amount to about 29-5 millionecus (about  15-6 millionX1) in each of the financial years 1984-85, 1985-86,1986-87 and 1987-1988.(J) Converted at the June market rate of 1   89 ecu =  1.14
Budgetary QuestionsThe 1980 and 1981 Community Budgets5.5 On 23 December 1980 the President of the European Parliamentannounced that she had declared both the 1980 Supplementary BudgetNo 2 and the 1981 Budget adopted.5.6 Some Member States called in question the legality of the EuropeanParliament&apos;s adoption of increases to the 1980 Supplementary Budget No 2and indicated that they were going to withhold payment of part of theadditional own resources contributions which the Commission had requested.In the event Germany, France and Belgium withheld  111-5 million in totalof their own resources contributions due by 2 January in respect of the1980 Supplementary Budget No 2.5.7 France and Germany have also withheld a small part oftheir own resources contributions (totalling together about  0-7 million eachmonth) to the 1981 Budget which were necessitated by the small increasevoted by the European Parliament (which France and Germany believedwas illegal). All other Member States are paying in full and theCommission are implementing the Budget.5.8 As part of attempts to resolve the budget dispute with France andGermany the Commission presented an Amending Budget for 1981 inmid-June which would produce a net reduction in the 1981 Budget broadlyequivalent to the increase voted by the European Parliament on 18 December1980. The main changes proposed in the Amending Budget are a reductionof 520 million ecus (about  327 millionX1) in the provision for the EAGGFGuarantee Section due to changes in market conditions offset by increases inother areas, principally 250 million ecus (about  157 million)^) for theRegional Development Fund.The 1982 Community Budget5.9 The Commission presented their proposals (the Preliminary DraftBudget for 1982) in mid-June. This provides for a total of 23,921 millionecus (about  12,512 million(2) in commitments and 22,381 million ecus(about  11,707 million)(2) in payments, an increase of some 13 per centover 1981. Examination of these proposals by the Council at official levelbegan in the latter part of June in preparation for the first Budget Councilscheduled for 23 July at which Ministers would establish the Draft Budgetfor 1982.Restructuring the Community Budget: The Commission&apos;s 30 May MandateReport5.10 On 24 June, the Commission published its proposals for thedevelopment of Community policies and the restructuring of the Community0) Converted at the rate of 1-5889 ecu =  1 used by the Commission for the 1981Budget.(2) Converted at the rate of 1-9118 ecu =  1 used by the Commission for the1982 Budget.1513523 c*2
Budget. This was in response to the Mandate given to the Commissionon 30 May 1980, when interim budget arrangements were agreed forabating the United Kingdom contribution.5.11 The report covers three main areas improvements to the CommonAgricultural Policy, the development of non-agricultural policies and theproblem of excessive net contributions to the budget by Member States. Onthe Common Agricultural Policy, it puts forward a number of recommendedguidelines for future decisions aimed at ensuring that Community spendingon agriculture grows at a slower rate than the increase in budget revenue.These include a narrowing of the gap between Community prices and thoseof its main trading competitors; an active export policy; and the adjustmentof guarantees in relation to production targets for each sector. The reportalso makes recommendations on a wide range of non-agricultural policies, andpromises specific proposals in certain areas. It suggests a greater concen-tration of the Regional and Social Funds on areas of greatest need. Finally,the report concludes that the United Kingdom&apos;s relatively low receipts fromthe Common Agricultural Policy put it in an inequitable budget situationand suggests that a continuing mechanism be established to make somecorrection for this. The report does not put figures on this proposal.5.12 The European Council had a preliminary discussion on the reportat its meeting on 29-30 June. The Foreign Affairs Council were givengeneral responsibility for co-ordinating work on the Mandate in preparationfor discussion at the European Council in November 1981 where appropriatedecisions are expected to be taken.Budget Refunds5.13 The United Kingdom received a further  547 million of refundsunder the Community Budget Agreement of 30 May 1980, bringing thetotal of such receipts paid so far to  645 million. Of these amounts, 210-5 million has been paid under the Financial Mechanism Regulation,and the balance has taken the form of Community support under theSupplementary Measures Regulation. Further refund payments are expectedlater in the year in respect of the balance of the United Kingdom&apos;s entitle-ment for 1980 and advance payments for 1981.Customs Union5.14 After a period of slow progress on the legislation programme whenthe harmonisation of customs procedures appeared to have become blocked,the Council agreed in February a Regulation on the harmonisation ofprocedures for the export of Community goods. This was followed in Mayby the adoption of the Mutual Assistance Regulation. This provides forMember States to assist each other, principally by exchanging information, toensure the correct collection of customs duties, levies etc and the correctpayment of disbursements under the CAP, and to prevent or investigateirregularities in these fields. It also provides that the Commission mayreceive such information and may co-ordinate action against irregularities.16
Harmonisafion of Tobacco Duties5.15 As a result of the continuing lack of progress on the proposals fora third stage in the harmonisation of the excise duty on cigarettes, the Councilagreed a new Directive in June extending the present stage of harmonisationfor a further 6 months to 31 December 1981. The derogation allowing theUnited Kingdom to charge an additional duty on higher tar cigarettes wasnot extended. The surcharge levied under this derogation was abolished inthis year&apos;s Budget, having achieved its purpose by reducing consumption ofhigher tar cigarettes to minimal proportions.Harmonisation of Alcoholic Drinks Duties5.16 There was no Council discussion of the compromise proposalsprepared at the end of 1980 in an attempt to find a solution to the majorissues raised by the proposals to harmonise the structure of the exciseduties on alcoholic drinks. The Court of Justice has allowed the UnitedKingdom and the Commission a further extension of time in the infractionproceedings concerning the relative level of duty on wine and beer in theUnited Kingdom to allow consideration of the harmonisation proposals.The parties now have until 30 September to report back to the Court.Export Credit5.17 The inability of participant countries to reach agreement lastyear on possible changes to the international Arrangement on Guidelines forExport Credit (the Consensus) has led to a renewed effort to reach agreementbefore the end of 1981. Community discussion has concentrated on trying tofind a mutually agreeable solution for the revision of the interest rate struc-ture, in order to bring minimum interest rates closer to market interest rates.Apart from reaching agreement on a possible interim increase in rates(which was not in the event acceptable to other participants) progress inthe Community in reaching a common view has been hampered by theproblem caused by those low interest rate countries whose market rateswould be below the revised Consensus minimum rate.SECTION VI:   REGIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRSEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC): Loans6.1 Loans totalling  1-7 million were made by the ECSC under Article56 of the Treaty of Paris following applications from United Kingdom com-panies in respect of projects creating employment opportunities for steeland coal workers affected by restructuring of the industries. Further loansare under negotiation. The United Kingdom Government providedguarantees against possible loss of currency fluctuations over the period ofthe loans for projects in the Assisted Areas.17
European Regional Development Fund6.2 The size of the Fund for 1981 has been set at 1,540 million ecus(about  815 million)^) of which 95 per cent or 1,463 million ecus (about 774 million)^) is for the quota section. Following the accession of Greece,which was given a 13 per cent quota, the quotas of the other nine MemberStates were revised. The United Kingdom quota for 1981 is 23-8 percent or 348-19 million ecus (about  184 million)(1). So far this year grantsof  80-9 million have been allocated to 225 infrastructure and four industrialprojects in the United Kingdom.6.3 The first United Kingdom programme to benefit under the non-Quota section of the Fund was approved by the Commission on 10 June,and relates to the improvement of the economic and social situation inthe border areas of Northern Ireland. The amount of assistance grantedfrom the Fund is up to 8 million ecus (about  4-23 million)^) which willbe allocated for the development of certain economic activities in thefields of tourism, communications, small and medium sized undertakingsand craft industries.Integrated Operations on Regional Problems6.4 In carrying forward the concept of integrated operations, for whichBelfast was selected by the Commission as one of the two pilot areas, anInformation Document outlining the development of the Belfast Area,action needed to tackle its problems and proposed groups of projects, waspresented by the Government to the Commission on 12 May. There isno separate legal instrument or fund for integrated operations, and anyfinancial assistance which might be provided under existing funds wouldbe subject to current Regulations and arrangements.European Investment Bank (EIB): Loans6.5 The EIB continued to make foreign currency loans for UnitedKingdom investment projects. Loans for public sector infrastructure(primarily in the Assisted Areas) totalled about  75 million whilst loansto private sector manufacturing industry in the Assisted Areas totalledabout  16 million. Most recipients of loans were covered against exchangerisk by the Government.Science and Technology6.6 On 20 January the Council agreed to increase the duration of theconcerted action project in the field of registration of congenital abnormali-ties (medical and public health research) from three years to four years(1978-81) without increasing the upper limit of expenditure commitment,330,000 ecus (about  175,000)0). Research under this programme is beingdirected towards the registration of congenital malformations, twins andmultiple pregnancies in selected regions of the Community and methodo-logical studies to obtain co-ordination of national registers and registrationprocedures.0) Converted at the June market rate of 1-89 ecu =  1.18
6.7 On 3 March the Council adopted a sectoral research and develop-ment programme for the environment (Environmental Protection andClimatology) which is to be carried out over 5 years ending on 31 December1985. A total amount of 34 million ecus (about  18 million)C) has beenallocated to the Environment Protection Sub-programme. The sub-programme is to be implemented by indirect and concerted actions andcovers sources, effects, reduction and prevention of pollution and wastes; theprotection, conservation and management of the natural environment;environmental information management; and man-environment interactions.6.8 On 17 March the Council adopted a programme in the field ofspecial scientific and technical training to be implemented by means ofadvanced training courses and grants. The programme will be carried outover four years from 1 January 1981 and the upper limit for expenditurecommitments has been set at 8-8 million ecus (about  4-6 millionX1).Under the programme grants will be awarded for scientific work at variouslevels of training which must be carried out in a Community country otherthan the applicant&apos;s country of origin or the country in which he normallyworks, excepting the Joint Research Centre. Finance will also be providedfor advanced training courses in areas of particular importance to theCommunity&apos;s research and development policy.6.9 On 9 April the Council adopted a Decision concerning the conclusionof the agreement between the Community and the Swiss Confederationextending the agreement on a concerted action project in the field ofregistration of congenital abnormalities (Medical and Public HealthResearch) by one year until 31 December 1981.Steel6.10 The 24 June Steel Council produced agreement on four majorissues. It agreed to continue the mandatory production quotas underArticle 58 of the ECSC Treaty for those products for which there was novoluntary producer agreement. (Quotas had already been agreed forderived products of Hot Rolled Coil on 4 June.) It was decided to phaseout specific aids to the steel industry by the end of 1984, in the meantimelinking aids directly to the elimination of over capacity, and to introducesocial measures to provide Community finance for early retirement. Shorttime working is to be linked directly to restructuring to help ease its effects.It was also decided that the ECSC rules on transparent and non-discriminatory pricing to steel merchants will be extended.6.11 In support of the internal measures at the beginning of the yearthe Commission requested those countries with whom they were negotiatingvoluntary restraint arrangements to cut back their sendings in 1981 by 15per cent in line with the decline in the Community market. This cutback isbeing reviewed for the second half of this year.Shipbuilding6.12 The fifth Directive was agreed by the Council on 28 April and willbe valid until 31 December 1982.   It is slightly wider in scope than thef1) Converted at the June market rate of 1 -89 ecu =  1.19
previous Directive in that it extends the framework for control of subsidiesto general financing measures, and amongst the specific aids covered nowincludes aids to shipowners.New Information Technology (Telematics)6.13 Discussion continued on the consideration of proposals for supportof micro-electronics and greater harmonisation and increased competition intelecommunication. The draft micro-electronics regulation was substantiallyrevised to meet the reservations of the United Kingdom and other MemberStates on the funding arrangements and negotiations are ncaring completion.Company Law6.14 Negotiations continued on a number of draft directives and otherinstruments including those dealing with the accounts of groups of companies,scissions (the division of public companies), the qualifications of auditors,collective investment funds (unit trusts) and the regular disclosure of infor-mation about companies whose shares arc admitted to Stock Exchangelisting.6.15 The Commission put forward two draft directives on the annualaccounts of credit institutions and on prospectuses for unlisted securities.These have been sent to the European Parliament and the Economic andSocial Committee for their opinions. The draft fifth directive (on the struc-ture of public companies including worker participation) remained underdiscussion by the European Parliament.Insurance6.16 The draft directive to facilitate the freedom to provide non-life-insurance services throughout the Community was discussed by the FinanceCouncil in March and in June. Progress was made on a number ofissues.Industrial Property6.17 Work continued on problems in connection with a CommunityPatent Convention, particularly those involving the litigation arrangements.In connection with the proposed regulation to establish a Community TradeMark system and the Council directive to approximate trade mark law ofMember States, a first meeting of a Working Group under Council auspiceswas held on 29 June at which the programme of future work in the Groupwas discussed.SECTION VII:   ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORTEnvironmental Issues7.1. The Environment Council met on 11 June. The proposal for adirective setting up a marine oil pollution information system was agreed,subject to settling some points of detail.   Further discussion by the Council20
of the draft directives on major accident hazards and the discharge of mercuryinto the aquatic environment by the chlor-alkali industry failed to achieveagreement. Discussion of the mercury directive produced some progress, butit proved impossible to resolve issues concerning the treatment of newplant. The Council also devoted some time to preliminary discussion ofcertain key issues in the draft directive on environmental assessment whichis aimed at setting up a system for the assessment of the environmentaleffects of certain proposed development projects.Inland Transport7.2 The Transport Council met on 26 March. A Resolution setting outbroad priorities in the transport field for the period 1981-83 was adopted.Topics mentioned in the Resolution include improving the situation of therailways; harmonizing competition conditions; transport infrastructure; com-bined transport; frontier crossings; operation of the market, (particularly forinternational traffic); and improving social conditions in the field of transport.7.3 The Council also discussed Community railway policy; Communityaid for transport infrastructure projects; and the multilateral road haulagequota for 1981, on which it still proved impossible to reach agreement. TheCouncil asked the Commission to carry out a study of the causes of frontierdelays, and to report by the end of the year.Shipping7.4 In March, the Council agreed to extend a previous Decision tomonitor the activities of Eastern Bloc carriers in Central American andEast African trades for a further two years. From 1 July 1981, the exercisewill also include the Far East trades.7.5 Examination in Council Working Groups of various proposalsintended to promote marine safety and pollution prevention led to Councilapproval of a Decision establishing a marine oil pollution information system,including an up-to-date inventory of resources available to fight oil pollution.A Community role in relation to the enforcement of international standardsfor shipping safety and pollution prevention in respect of shipping usingCommunity ports is being discussed in parallel with a wider study involvingnon-Community countries.Civil Aviation7.6 Discussion continued in the Council on the draft regulation forthe liberalisation of intra-Community regional air services, which resultedfrom a United Kingdom initiative. Following a separate United Kingdominitiative and in response to a request from the Council to examine thequestion of air fares in the Community, the Commission continued theirconsultations with Member States&apos; experts and interested outside bodies inthe Community.21
SECTION VIII:   SOCIAL AFFAIRSEmployment8.1 An informal meeting of Employment Ministers took place on6-7 April. As with previous meetings of this kind, no formal conclusionswere issued but a useful exchange of views took place on income restraintand on the Commission&apos;s ideas for possible future work in the social affairsfield.8.2 The Standing Committee on Employment (which includes represen-tatives of employers and workers as well as Employment Ministers and theCommission) met on 19 May and discussed Commission papers on theproblems of unemployment. The Chairman&apos;s summary noted that on presentindications the general economic and social situation is likely to get worse,and called for an overall strategy at Community level designed to meeteconomic and social needs. The discussions at this meeting formed part ofthe preparations for the Joint Council of Employment, Economic andFinance Ministers (&quot; Jumbo Council &quot;) held on 11 June (see paragraph 8.4).8.3 At the Labour and Social Affairs Council on 10 June there was adiscussion of Commission papers on the employment problem. The Councilalso reached agreement on a higher rate of European Social Fund inter-vention for Greece (see paragraph 8.6) and on the need for a Commissioncommunication on the relationship between health and safety and removalof barriers to trade.8.4 On 11 June a Joint Council of Employment, Economic and FinanceMinisters met to discuss unemployment. It was generally agreed that co-ordinated action was necessary and that the principal weapon againstunemployment was a reduction in the level of inflation. Instruments such asthe Regional and Social Funds could make a significant contribution towardsimproving Community employment prospects, and the Government proposedthat the Social Fund should place more emphasis on measures to deal withsuch current urgent needs as declining employment in traditional manu-facturing industries and the training of young people. There might also bean important role for the Fund in supporting the training needs of newtechnology. The Government also made clear that there were no quickand easy solutions to the problem of unemployment and competitiveness andemployment could be endangered by inappropriate Community instrumentsimposing conditions normally determined by individual negotiations.European Social Fund8.5 In June, the Commission announced the first batch of Social Fundallocations for 1981. They included  40-3 million for the United Kingdom.The following table shows how the United Kingdom allocations weredistributed between different areas   mYoung people ............ 14-5Regions of high unemployment ...... 21-9Handicapped............... 2-4Technical progress    ...      ... ...... 1-522
The Fund is oversubscribed this year, so the Commission have decided notto make any decisions on grants to aid textile workers, migrant workers,women and groups of undertakings until the remaining 1981 applicationshave been considered.Greek Priority Regions8.6 On 10 June, the Social Affairs Council approved in principle witheffect from 1 January 1981 a Regulation extending special priority status ona temporary basis to the whole of Greece, which thereby qualified for ahigher rate of European Social Fund intervention (55 per cent) than non-priority regions (50 per cent). The Regulation when formally adopted willremain in force until new Regulations take effect following the forthcomingreview of the Fund (due to be completed by 1982), but will not constitute aprecedent for the review of the Social Fund or for the European RegionalDevelopment Fund.Social Security8.7 The 10 June Social Affairs Council agreed to the Commission&apos;sproposal for an amendment to the Regulations on social security for migrantworkers. The amendments were largely technical in nature and tookaccount of developments in social security legislation in Member States.8.8 However, one important amendment gives authorities in theMember States more control over the type of health treatment which maybe authorised for persons who seek permission to go to other MemberStates for treatment.8.9 The Council also discussed the implementation of its Decision inNovember 1980 to extend the cover of the Regulations on social securityto the self-employed and their families. The Commission agreed to bringforward their proposals with all speed.Anti-poverty Programme8.10 The programme of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty,set up in 1975, came to an end in November 1980. The Commission arerequired to submit to the Council a final evaluation of the five-yearprogramme.Consumer Affairs8.11 The Second Consumer Programme was adopted on 19 May. Itprovides a framework within which the Commission will over the next fiveyears continue the work commenced under the First Consumer Programme,adopted in 1975. It embodies the approach that consumers&apos; interests arebest served by a combination of Community and national action and thatthe Community should confine its action to problems with a genuineCommunity-wide dimension. The Commission will report periodically onthe progress of the Programme.23
Education8.12 Community Education Ministers met on 22 June. They discussededucation and training policies, in the context of the employment situationand the spread of new technologies, and asked the Education Committeeto put forward proposals on future co-operation in this area. Ministersalso compared experience on the impact of demographic change on schoolsystems; and asked for a report on the scope for Community action topromote the mutual recognition of diplomas.SECTION IX : ENERGY9.1 The 3 March Energy Council noted that achievement of theenergy guidelines for 1990 adopted last year would require several MemberStates to intensify their efforts, both in the field of power stations by morerapid substitution of solid fuel consumption for oil consumption and bystepping up nuclear programmes; and in the field of energy savings, whetherin the domestic sector, industry or transport.9.2 The Council also invited the Commission to examine the possibleneed to increase investment in order to achieve the common objectives;and confirmed the importance they attached to energy pricing, to opennessabout true prices and costs, and to the communication on pricing theCommission would submit to the next Energy Council. They noted alsothat there had been a significant improvement in Community oil marketssince the November 1980 Energy Council, and invited the Commission tostudy further the possibilities for mutual aid in oil stocks at times ofmarket tension and to report to the Council.9.3 The 24 June Energy Council agreed that the present easing of theworld oil market must not lead to a slackening of international efforts todevelop improved arrangements for handling a renewed tight market and torestructure the energy economies of Community countries in a way whichwould reduce dependence on imported oil. Any new arrangements must,to be effective, involve other major consuming countries, and shouldprovide for the use of some stocks even when the market was not sotight as to require formal international allocation of oil. The Commissionwere asked to continue work on this subject, including consultations withthe oil companies, taking into account continuing discussions in theInternational Energy Agency.9.4 The Council also stressed the need for an adequate level of invest-ment, particularly in the rational use of energy. The importance ofeconomic pricing and market mechanisms was recognised. Investment inenergy could provide new jobs but the possible inflationary effects shouldbe watched. The Commission will pursue a sectoral analysis of energyinvestment and submit proposals for the better co-ordination of nationalefforts and for the promotion of increased use of coal in general industry.24
9.5 The Commission reported on progress with the study of energyprices which they were asked to undertake by the Council on 3 March.The importance of economic pricing was again generally recognised as wasthe need for detailed work if this principle was to be effectively implemented.9.6 The Department of Energy and United Kingdom energy industriesreceived in grants  2-6 million from the European Coal and Steel Com-munity for coal research and re-adaplation aid for miners:  1-3 millionfrom Euratom for nuclear research and  4-9 million from the EuropeanRegional Development Fund for electricity and gas infrastructure. Fundswere also received for research into alternative energy sources and fordemonstration projects in alternative energy and energy savings.SECTION X:   THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITYThe European Parliament10.1 Some important activities of the European Parliament in relationto specific Community proposals are mentioned in the earlier sections ofthis White Paper. There was, moreover, discussion of its seat; at the23-24 March Maastricht European Council, the representatives of theMember States decided unanimously to confirm the status quo in regardto the provisional places of work of the European institutions.European Commission10.2 The four year term of office of a new Commission began on6 January under the Presidency of Mr Gaston Thorn. The British Commis-sioners are Mr Christopher Tugendhat, responsible for the budget portfolioand Mr Ivor Richard, responsible for employment and social affairs.European Court of Justice10.3 Agreement was reached on the enlargement of the Court. Underthe terms of the agreement the Court is to be composed of 11 Judges and5 Advocates-General. The eleventh Judgeship will rotate between thelarge Member States until the post is taken permanently by thenext State to accede to the Community and the fifth Advocate-Generalpost is to be held in turn by the small Member Slates. It is hoped thatthe increase in the size of the Court will overcome the increase in timebetween the introduction of a case and judgment.10.4 Three cases have been referred to the European Court of Justiceby United Kingdom Courts for preliminary rulings and the United Kingdomhas submitted written observations in two of these cases, as well as inseven other cases before the European Court. In addition two actionshave been brought against the United Kingdom by the Commission. Inone case the Commission allege a failure to implement adequately indomestic legislation the requirement that there should be equal pay forwork &quot; to which equal value is attributed &quot;; in the other the Commission25
allege infringement by the United Kingdom of Article 30 on the freemovement of goods by the requirement that UHT milk, whether homeproduced or imported, must be treated on United Kingdom licenced andcontrolled premises.10.5 The Court has given judgment in three cases of particularsignificance. In Commission v. United Kingdom (the second &quot; FisheriesCase &quot;) the Court held that the United Kingdom failed to fulfil its obligationsunder the EEC Treaty by adopting or maintaining a number of fisheryconservation measures without appropriate consultation with the Commissionand in spite of the Commission&apos;s objections. Two important judgments haveconcerned the interpretation of Article 119 of the EEC Treaty on equalpay. In Worringham and Humphreys v. Lloyds Bank Ltd the Court ruledthat a contribution to a retirement benefit scheme which is paid by anemployer in the name of employees by means of an addition to the grosssalary, and which therefore helps to determine the amount of that salary,constitutes &quot; pay &quot; within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article119 and that this Article may be relied upon, in the circumstances of thiscase, before the national courts who have a duty to ensure the protection ofthe rights which the Article vests in individuals. In Jenkins v. Kingsgatethe Court ruled that a difference in pay between full-time and part-timeworkers is not contrary to Article 119 unless it is indirectly a means ofdiscriminating against women workers. When the national court is able,using the criteria of equal work and equal pay, without the operation ofCommunity or national measures, to establish that the payment of lowerhourly rates of remuneration for part-time work represents discriminationbased on differences of sex, the provisions of Article 119 of the EEC Treatyapply directly.SECTION XI: PARLIAMENT11.1 Parliament was in session for 22 weeks from 1 January to 30 June1981. During that time the House of Commons Select Committee onEuropean Legislation etc considered 381 Community documents andrecommended 45 of these for further consideration by the House. TheHouse of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities considered373 documents, of which 11 were recommended for debate. Debates on 34documents were held in the House of Commons and on 15 in the Houseof Lords.26

ANNEX VUNITED KINGDOM VISIBLE TRADE WITH THEEUROPEAN COMMUNITYImportance of Trade with the European Community1. United Kingdom trade with the European Community accounts forover 40 per cent of our overseas trade. In 1980 our leading export marketwas the Federal Republic of Germany while all the countries then membersof the Community were in our top dozen export markets.Trade Performance with the European Community (See Table 1)2. In 1980 the United Kingdom had a visible trade surplus of  0-7billion with the European Community, a substantial improvement on thedeficits of  2- 2| billion in each of the years 1974 to 1979. The ratio ofour exports to the Community to our imports from the Community, whichmakes some allowance for inflation, recovered during that time and reached104 in 1980 the highest figure for a decade. Due to the industrial actionby Civil Servants figures for 1981 are not yet available.By Commodity (See Table 2)3. During the 1970s our trade performance in manufactures, whichaccount for about 70 per cent of our trade with the European Community,generally deteriorated, although there was some improvement in the crudebalance in 1980. However, in terms of the ratio of exports to imports thisperformance was similar to that with the rest of the developed world. TheUnited Kingdom share of the European Community import market formanufacturers in 1979 was maintained at about 7 per cent during 1980.4.
