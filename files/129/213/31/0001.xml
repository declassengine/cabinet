CONFIDENTIALHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 5610 November 1981COPY NO82CABINETOIL TANKER DRIVERS:  CONTINGENCY MEASURESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1. This paper reports on the current pay negotiations between the fourmajor oil companies (British Petroleum (BP), Shell, Esso and Texaco) and theirtanker drivers.     The Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) hascalled for an all-out strike from 16 November if the union pay claim of 11 percent is not met.    The paper also examines the options open to the Governmentin preparing to protect the essential needs of the community should a striketake place.2. The four companies have been conducting separate negotiations withthe union.    While their offer of 8.1 per cent has been notified to all the driven,only in the case of BP has there been a vote.    It is the view of the managementof BP that the outcome would have been a majority in favour of acceptance.However, at a meeting of shop stewards on Monday, this vote was declaredinvalid, apparently on the grounds that the union had not been able fully to puttheir arguments to their members.    The shop stewards are returning to con-sult the workforce on the basis of a vote to &quot;accept 8. 1 per cent or strike&quot; andthey will not report back until Friday afternoon.3. This ia a setback to hopes of a general move towards a settlementsince the attitude of the Shell drivers is uncertain and in Esso there is aconsiderable degree of militancy.     Management in these companies do notknow what soundings the union has been taking but they guess that it is moreprobably on a choice between the 11 per cent claim or a strike, rather than onthe 8.1 per cent offer.    There is considerable pressure from the top unionofficials, led by Mr Alex Kitson (TGWU), for strike action, even thoughmanagement believes that the majority of drivers are against this.4. By the time Cabinet meets I will have a clearer picture of the generalposition in the industry and in particular in Shell, whose shop stewards me elon Wednesday.     Esso shop stewards do not report until Thursday.    Given theBP shop stewards&apos; decision, we cannot be optimistic of an early settlementand we cannot dismiss the possibility of a strike next Monday.    The best hopeis that, when BP shop stewards return on Friday, they will produce a clear1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALacceptance of the 8.1 per cent offer.     This at least would break ranks in theunion position.    In that event we may see a partial strike or a variety oflesser forms of industrial action.    These would probably not require animmediate response from the Government but would need to be monitored bythe Civil Contingencies Unit (CCU).5. At a meeting of CCU on 4 November, Ministers decided to takepreliminary steps to bring forward plans to protect essential services fromfuel shortages.    If an all-out strike occurred, it would cut off two-thirds ofnormal supplies of oil products (the remaining one-third comprising pipeline,sea and rail deliveries) and would bring almost all road deliveries to a halt.The Services&apos; plan, LEADBURN, would restore about one-third of roadsupplies, thus protecting essential services, with some limited capacity tospare.    But at best, there would remain a shortfall of about 40 per cent inoverall supplies and large parts of industry and commerce, and the generalpublic, would get no new supplies at all.6. Shortages on this scale would have early and serious consequences forthe community and the economy.    Road transport for the general run ofindustry would become largely immobilised within about two weeks, preventingthe movement of raw materials aad products.     Parts of industry would begin tocome to a halt after two or three weeks when reserve stocks were exhausted.Although public transport would be kept going by Services action, there wouldbe increasing difficulties in getting people to work as motorists ran dry. Wehave no previous experience of this kind of situation and, although peoplegenerally would no doubt do their best to get round the difficulties, thepressures arising from fuel deprivation are bound to make themselves feltquite early on.7. Against this background 160 Service instructors were placed on noticeon 5 November to move to training locations on 12 November, and on10 November, the main body of 12, 500 men were placed on six days&apos; notice tomove.    This is the latest timetable on which we could be ready for thepossibility of an all-out strike on 16 November.8. The CCU plans to hold a further meeting this Friday.    The optionsavailable to it are as follows:a. to stand down the Services (if the situation has improvedsignificantly); orb. to confirm the implementation of LEADBURN on 16 November andseek a Privy Council to secure the Proclamation of a State ofEmergency on that day (if the situation has sharply deteriorated); orc. to place the main body of Servicemen on 24 hours&apos; standby fromSunday 15 November (if an all-out strike on 16 November looksuncertain).    In this case it may be convenient to authorise the Home2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSecretary, in consultation with the Frime Minister and otherMinisters immediately involved, to take any appropriate decision thatmay be needed over the weekend or in the early part of next week.9. If, in the light of developments between now and Thursday, we areunable to decide at Cabinet to relax existing measures, I invite my colleaguesto agree that CCU should choose as appropriate from the options inparagraph 8 above.N LDepartment of Energy10 November 19813CONFIDENTIAL
