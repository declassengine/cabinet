TWENTY FIRST REPORT FROM THE HOUSE OF LORDS SELECTCOMMITTEE ON THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, SESSION 1980-81DEVELOPMENT AID POLICYThe Government warmly welcomes the Report, which was discussed by theHouse of Lords on 3 June (Official Report Vol 420, no 89), and has thefollowing comments on the main recommendations summarised on pages xlivto xlvi:(i) The overall shape of the Community&apos;s aid programme should be substantiallymodified over time. Its regionally selective nature, moulded by past historicalcircumstances, should be converted into a worldwide programme responding to diedevelopment needs of the Third World in the 1980s and matching the Community&apos;sstatus in the world. The United Kingdom Government should press for such changesmore assertively than in the past.The Government reaffirms the UK&apos;s continuing objective to encourage theemergence of a global Community aid and development policy. The acceptancein 1975 of the first Lome Convention by all those Commonwealth countrieseligible under Protocol 22 to the Treaty of Accession, and the subsequentextension of these arrangements to other similar countries, was a considerableachievement. But the Lome pattern is not the only one for the Community. TheUK has consistently supported the development of relations between theCommunity and other countries (for instance through the EC/ASEAN agree-ment) and the establishment of a substantial programme of aid to other poorercountries together with the improvement of food aid distribution and adminis-tration. But the attainment of a development aid programme with bettergeographical balance is bound to be a matter of compromise and negotiation,a process of evolution rather than revolution; and the extent to which theGovernment can press for it must depend a good deal on its own policies aboutthe size and use of the whole British aid programme.(ii) In comparison with other Community policies, the present proportion of aidchannelled through the EEC is reasonable. Nevertheless, the need for moredevelopment aid, efficiently applied, is manifest. As more resources are madeavailable, the first priority should be to restore or increase Member States&apos;bilateral programmes and their contributions to other multilateral agencies.The Government agrees that the first priority for any resources becomingavailable for allocation under the aid programme must be bilateral aid.(iii) The present practice of imputing all EEC aid expenditure to the OverseasDevelopment Administration&apos;s vote is not justified; greater flexibility should bepermitted, especially in connection with food aid.The Government does not agree with this recommendation. Attribution of theUK share of Community aid expenditure to the Aid Programme enables closercontrol to be exercised over the total amount of UK resources devoted to aid.The Government recognises that attribution can give rise to certain practicalproblems in managing the Aid Programme; for example when the Commissionproposes to transfer unspent funds from other parts of the Community budget3
to one of its aid programmes; but possible solutions to these problems are beingexamined. There is no justification for treating expenditure on EC food aiddifferently from other forms of Community aid. On the valuation of dairyproducts for food aid, see Recommendation xi.(iv) EDF aid to the ACP countries will be unchanged until 1985, when thepresent Lome Convention expires. Its record would justify its continuation. Ifmore resources became available for Community aid, the Committee would expectsome increase in the size of the EDF. But there are no strong grounds for increasingaid to this relatively favoured group of recipients if increments would be at theexpense oj EEC aid programmes in Asia and Latin America, or at the expense ofMember States&apos; bilateral aid or their contributions to other multilateral aidagencies such as the World Bank&apos;s IDA.The Government agrees that arrangements similar to those under the LomeConvention, which covers a much wider range of policies than aid alone, canbe expected to continue after 1985; the ACP group contains many of thepoorest developing countries and over half the group are members of theCommonwealth. The total size of any further EDF will then be the subject ofnegotiation with the ACP countries, and at that stage the Government will haveto look very carefully at any proposals in the light of constraints upon publicspending and the aid programme in particular. In practice any increase in suchaid cannot but be at the expense of other bilateral or multilateral (includingEC) aid.(v) Initial allocations of aid to individual ACP countries appear to be made withsome flexibility and inconsistency. Although EDF disbursements do not appear tobe generally slower than those of other multilateral aid agencies, delays in dis-bursements erode the value of aid pledged to ACP countries under the LomeConventions. To improve the rate of disbursement, greater responsibility shouldbe given to EEC Delegates in recipient countries to approve projects, after shorterconsultation with Brussels.The allocation of EDF funds to individual ACP countries is entirely a matterfor the Commission, whose calculations reflect the Community political com-mitments and developmental criteria.In negotiating the present Lome Convention considerable efforts were made tostreamline procedures. These will be continuing through a new Committee ofthe joint ACP-EC Council of Ministers. The idea of devolving spending auth-ority to Commission Delegates is superficially attractive but would entaildisadvantages. Large sums of money are involved and the Government has aresponsibility to Parliament and taxpayers to ensure effective scrutiny of projectproposals. Present procedures provide the necessary safeguards for MemberStates. Delay in disbursements, as the Committee recognises, reflect not so muchfactors peculiar to the Community&apos;s aid administration as problems inherent ingetting aid projects (particularly those relating to rural development) onto theground. ^ (viii)   The Mediterranean developing countries do not rank among the poorer^ \ . developing countries. When the Maghreb and Mashreq financial protocols arerenewed later this year, Community aid will have to be maintained, but it should4
(vi)     The relatively poor performance of the United Kingdom inodfining contracts under the EPF can only be rectified by firms therr.-coIvrs.   Hoy/ever, they deserve the full and enthusiastic support ofGov eminent in their efforts, and recent improvements in the Goverr.&apos;rior.t&apos;services to firms, along with those of the clearing banks, should bemaintained.The Government accepts this recommendation.    Improving the British shareof EDF contracts is one of the Government&apos;s priorities.    In the end itis up to firms to decide whether or not to bid for EDF contracts basingtheir decisions on their own commercial judgement.    But the Governmenthas a role to play in increasing their awareness of the opportunitiesavailable.The World Aid Section of the Projects and Export Policy Division of theDepartments of Trade and Industry provides guidance and advice on how topursue opportunities under the EDF, disseminates information tosubscribers through the Export Intelligence Service, and makes projectdossiers available for inspection.    Leaflets about the EDF are madeavailable to visitors or enquirers.A joint industry/Government Working Group was set up in January 1981to examine the difficulties which firms face and to reach conclusionsabout improving their performance.    The Working Group report outlinesa number of initiatives which have been or are being taken by theGovernment, by industry and by the European Commission, mainly in theflow of information, system of payments and additional publicity.^V*^     The proportion of British nationals in key positions inElectorate-General VIII (Development) of the Commission is inadequate;the Government should seek to rectify it.The Government shares the Committee&apos;s concern about the inadequatenumber, of British personnel in senior positions in DGVIII; and hasraised this problem at a high level with the Commission.    The latter-ully accepts the need to improve the distribution of posts in Brussels.enough it may take time to achieve it. The UK now has, generallyspeaking, a reasonable share of posts in the Commission Delegations0Verseas. /(viii)
not be increased. More emphasis should be placed on using loan finance, includingEuropean Investment Bank loans, to assist development in the Mediterraneandeveloping countries.The Government agrees with this recommendation. The countries of theSouthern Mediterranean are relatively well-off, with the obvious exception ofEgypt and Morocco. There are strong political arguments for continuing aid tothis region, but the Government agrees that an increase in real terms would bevery difficult to justify. In Community discussions the UK has been amongthose who have consistently argued for a shift away from soft aid towards agreater concentration on EIB lending, and for such soft aid as there is to gochiefly to the poorer countries.(ix) The Community&apos;s food aid programme suffers from inefficiencies in planning,administration and delivery. The suitability for developing countries of some of theprogrammes (notably dairy foods) is questionable. A management regulation isnecessary to encourage multiannual planning and less haphazard execution anddelivery. The United Kingdom Government should press the Council of Ministersto adopt the Commission&apos;s draft management regulation.The Government agrees that there are defects in the administration of EC foodaid and has consistently pressed for adoption of the proposed ManagementRegulation. This will provide for greater control over administration by theCommission and enhance the developmental impact of EC food aid.The Council of Ministers (Development) has already decided that multi-yearfood aid commitments should be possible in certain circumstances, and thatallocations of EC food aid should be more closely associated where possiblewith other development aid, both from the Community and from MemberStates.The Government recognises the limited value of aid in the form of dairyproducts, although this has been particularly useful in supporting &quot;OperationDairy Flood&quot; in India. More generally, since expert views differ, the WorldFood Programme are about to carry out an in-depth evaluation of projects forfeeding vulnerable groups. Its outcome should provide valuable evidence ondifferent forms of food aid in various situations.(x) In the interest of administrative efficiency, the Community should concentrateits food aid on fewer countries, increase its collaboration with other aid agencies,and increase the number of staff in Directorate-General VIII of the Commissiondevoted to the food aid programme.The Government broadly accepts these recommendations. The Commission hastraditionally allocated food aid very widely and has responded positively to asmany food aid requests as seem to meet the Community&apos;s agreed criteria. TheUK has sought to exclude very small allocations and allocations to the betteroff developing countries. Since views among the ten Member States vary, andthere is some expectation among past recipients that they will continue to obtainallocations, a reduction in the number of recipients may not be easily agreed.EC food aid has always involved collaboration with international agencies.This should be stepped up in future especially in providing food aid to the smaller
needy countries. But increased collaboration on projects is more difficult sincethe World Food Programme, which is the obvious candidate, is already a sub-stantial recipient of EC food aid and the Commission&apos;s own staff are stretched.The EC is working with other agencies, eg UNHCR, Red Cross and somenon-governmental organisations.The Commission is aware of staffing constraints. The Government has en-couraged strengthening the Food Aid Division by transfer of staff from else-where in the Commission.(xi) The size of the food aid programme in dairy products should be reduced.Budgetary savings should be transferred into programmes of financial aid, par-ticularly for non-associated countries. Dairy food aid should no longer be valuedat world market prices or imputed to the British aid budget at this price.The House of Commons Committee on Agriculture concluded last year thatthere were serious limitations on dairy food aid and that local dairy industriesshould be encouraged but that there was some scope for an increase. Sincepresent levels were set in 1976, largely to accommodate &quot;Operation DairyFlood&quot;, the UK has consistently opposed any further increases in EC dairy foodaid, mainly on cost-effective grounds but also because of increasing doubtsabout the nutritional value of such aid. It would be difficult to secure a volumereduction since this would need to be fairly widely supported among MemberStates, but the Government is willing to explore this provided it does notjeopardise past commitments.There are no procedural obstacles to transferring savings on dairy food aid toother parts of the budget, such as non-associates aid. But the Governmentwould have to consider such a transfer against its policy of placing moreemphasis on bilateral aid.The Government agrees that the valuation of the EC dairy food aid at worldprices does not reflect the economic value of such aid. But the financial cost ofsuch aid to the Community Budget is the Community price, which is normallyhigher than the world price. This cost is divided between Chapter 6 (agri-cultural support) and Chapter 9 (development aid) with the latter carrying onlythe world market price in accordance with agreed international conventions.The workings of CAP make it difficult to devise any other system for obtainingfood aid from surplus stocks. The question of true cost and value is currentlyunder study by the Commission with the help of outside consultants. In thelight of their conclusions, Member States would have to consider whether anychanges should be made to the present arrangements.(xii) Contracts for transporting food aid should cease to be tied to contracts forsupplying the food.The Government agrees with this recommendation. The EC Commission isbound by regulation to supply that part of its food aid which is sent to ports ofunloading under single contracts, but would prefer contracts for transport to bea separate issue from procurement of commodities. A formal proposal to changethe food aid shipment regulation is expected after approval of the food aidManagement Regulation. One idea is to explore the possibility of appointing a
single agent to handle all EC food aid shipment past the procurement stage.Every effort will be made to secure equal opportunities for UK shippers. Therecan however be administrative advantages in retaining single freight inclusivecontracts for deliveries to land-locked countries.(xiii) Financial aid to non-associated developing countries in Asia and LatinAmerica should he expanded. Savings on reduced dairy food aid should he trans-ferred to the non-associates programme. The administration of the programmeshould be improved by strengthening the staff devoted to it in the Commission andby greater collaboration with Member States&apos; posts and aid divisions in non-associated countries.More progress has been made in the non-associates programme than the Reportsuggests. Including 1981, 533-5 mecu ( 330m) have been committed. Theprogramme concentrates on slow-spending kinds of rural aid, but disbursementsin 1980 picked up significantly to nearly 40 mecu ( 25m) more than in 1976 to1979 put together. The Government will wish to see that it remains substantial,but a quicker expansion of the non-associates programme by transferring anysavings from dairy food aid although procedurally possible, would be incon-sistent with the Government&apos;s aim of placing more emphasis on bilateral aid.The Government will continue to urge that more Commission staff should bemoved to this work now that there is a Management Regulation to set theprogramme on a permanent footing. The Council agreed in 1976 that Com-munity and bilateral aid should be co-ordinated and the Government will dowhat it can, so far as British aid is concerned, whenever this is possible. But mostproject preparation must fall to the Commission and the recipient country.(xiv) Co-financing with other donors should continue; to increase the rate ofdisbursement, the Community should relax its procedures for appraising andapproving individual projects itselfThe Management Regulation requires co-financing for a substantial part of theprogramme, but it has to operate within guidelines agreed by the Council ofMinisters, and in accordance with the legal requirements of EC financialregulations. Potential co-financing partners often have other priorities andrules. The Government will encourage a good working relationship between theCommission and co-financing partners so that the Commission can rely to theextent practicable upon project appraisal by the latter, without in effect simplyproviding an addition to their funds over which the Community exercises nocontrols.(xv) Non-associated countries should be enabled to use EEC aid to raise andservice loans from other sources for development projects, thus increasing the totalamount of resources available to them. The Community should establish thenecessary machinery to put together agreed financial packages in conjunction withthe recipient country and the potential lender. Contracts for projects financed withsuch loans should be open to international competitive bidding. If this new schemefor increasing the value of Community aid was successful in non-associatedcountries, it could be extended to a larger part of the Community&apos;s aid programme.The Government has noted the ideas in paragraphs 121-126 of the Report. Itsassessment is that, in the absence of new EC money, the sacrificing of annual7
grants to finance once for all loans would increase the recipients&apos; indebtednesswhile at the same time removing a source of servicing it. This in turn wouldmake the country less attractive to potential commercial creditors. There couldalso be the serious administrative and negotiating difficulties in operating thescheme which are common to many co-financing arrangements.(xvi) NGOs operating small-scale development projects achieve a valuable formof development assistance among the poorest sections of the population in ThirdWorld countries. They should be able to plan their co-financing operations with theCommunity over a longer period; commitment appropriations in the EEC budgetshould therefore be allocated to individual NGOs with suitable programmes, whoshould then be able to draw payment appropriations over an agreed number ofyears. Suitable indigenous NGOs in developing countries should be given accessto Community funds for co-financing.The Government shares the Committee&apos;s appreciation of NGOs&apos; work amongthe poorest. In principle commitment appropriations could already be allocatedto an NGO for disbursement over several years on agreed projects; but theremay be practical difficulties stemming from present Council guidelines for theprogramme. The Government will take up the problem of financial uncertaintywhen discussing new draft conditions this autumn. But to fund the NGOs ofrecipient countries directly would be likely to pose problems of financial andpolitical accountability which would place disproportionate demands on thesmall section of the Commission which administers the scheme.(xvii) The Community should increase efforts within its existing aid programmesto work with OPEC countries to recycle surpluses to developing countries throughco-financing and by attracting extra loan finance for developing countries.The Government supports continuing efforts by the Community to welcomeOPEC countries and development institutions as co-financing partners forprojects in ACP, Mediterranean and non-associated developing countries.Between 1976 and 1979 OPEC funds contributed 19 per cent, over  350m, tothe cost of projects co-financed under the last Lome Convention, whose totalvalue was nearly  2Q6rn; the EC contribution to these projects was 32 per centand 12 per cent came from the World Bank. OPEC funds also provided over 100m over the same period to projects co-financed with the European Invest-ment Bank. The Government fully expects such co-operation to continue andexpand under the second Lome Convention. The Community is continuingdiscussions with the OPEC countries and related institutions on the possibilitiesfor co-operation, but inevitably differing priorities set a limit on its extent.(xviii) 77;&lt;? positions of Member States in international gatherings on developmentissues during 1981, and in the UN Global Negotiations, must be co-ordinated.Member States should act together to accelerate acceptance of a more urgentapproach to the problem of global development and the expansion of world trade.The Government will seek to co-ordinate the positions of Member States, so faras practicable, as the Committee recommend. Like all EC member governments,the Government is conscious of the need to accelerate the pace of global eco-nomic recovery, and to take account of the special problems affecting thepoorer developing countries. We are consulting closely with our Community8
partners as the best means of achieving these objectives. The Community&apos;sNorth/South High-level Group meets regularly to review this range of subjects.In the first five months of 1981 Baron von Wechmar, the German President ofthe General Assembly, has, with the support of the UK and other MemberStates of the Community, held extensive consultations in an effort to agreeacceptable procedure to launch the Global Negotiations. But the US Adminis-tration has said that its review of North/South policy will not be completeduntil after the Ottawa and Mexico Summits. In view of the vital role of theUnited States in the Global Negotiations, there would be little value in con-tinuing preliminary consultations without them. We hope that the MexicoSummit will have a constructive influence on perceptions of major internationaleconomic issues. We will participate actively, and, as President of the Com-munity during the second half of 1981, will be willing to take account of anyviews expressed by Community partners who will not be present.(xix) If no significant progress is made in international meetings and negotiationsin which Member States are involved during 1981, the Community itself shouldtake an initiative to negotiate agreements which would stimulate the large-scalerecycling of OPEC surpluses to the poorer developing countries.The principal capital markets can be expected to continue to play a major rolein recycling the oil surpluses, but for the poorest countries there will still be aneed for significant official aid flows. EC Member States, including the UK, haveactively encouraged OPEC involvement. The Government has supported anenlarged role for the IMF and has agreed that its funds will need to be aug-mented correspondingly. Arrangements are being made for Saudi Arabia tomake available up to an additional SDR 8 billion to the Fund over the next twoyears, and negotiations are continuing with certain other OPEC countries.Virtually all the IMF&apos;s recent lending has been channelled towards developingcountries. Discussion of these matters will continue in relevant internationalbodies.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Royle City Ltd10952 Dd 0293879 CO 0/819
