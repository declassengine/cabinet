CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT0 iC(81) 36 COPY NO23 June 198iCABINETNORTHERN IRELAND:   PRISONS AND POLITICSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Northeru Ireland1. My colleagues will be broadly aware of the two interconnectedproblems which we face in Northern Ireland.2. Foui hanger strikers have died in the Maze prison, seven more arerefusing food ard the first of these is likely to die in the early days of July.Thereafter, every week or so will see another death, and the ProvisionalIrish Republican Army have said that this procession will continue ur.tiltheir demands are met.    For eight months we have stood firm againsttheir demands which, taken together, are a claim for &quot;political status&quot;.The last four deaths led to street violence in Belfast and Londonderry of akind not seen on such a scale for some years, thereby alienating theCatholic population of the Province.    I am clear that we cannot concedethe strikers&apos; demand for political status, but there is a real danger that weshall lose the support of world opinion (with all that means) if we do not tryto find some way forward in Northern Ireland.3. On the political front, we have for two years sought the agreementof the local parties to a form of devolved government.    It is now clear thatsuch agreement is not to be had.      We shall, therefore, continue withdirect rule unchanged, but we detect a widely-based belief that we should&quot;do something&quot; in the area of political development as the only durableresponse to the tensions revealed by the prison issue.     The Defence andOversea Policy Committee (OD) considered these two problems lastThursday and concluded as follows.4. On prisons, we should set up an independent and expert Committeeto consider the medium and longer-term problems of Northern Irelandprisons &apos;eg the need next year to move &quot;special category&quot; prisoners fromthe compounds in the Maze to a new cellular prison);  but it would have to bemade quite clear that the Committee would not be concerned with theimmediate problems of the hunger strikers and other protesters.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. However the Home Secretary and I have concluded that it would beprovocative to announce the setting up of such a Committee now (although Ishall still need to have it at a later stage).     Either we should be subjectedto intolerable public and Parliamentary pressure to let the Committeereport on the immediate problems - which it could scarcely do satisfac-torily under the duress of successive hunger strike deaths;   or we should beregarded as incredibly insensitive in deliberately ignoring those deaths andthe associated violence.    In my view we should exacerbate moderateopinion in the world generally, and increase the alienation of thoseCatholics in Northern Ireland who might otherwise be sympathetic to ourpresent stand.    I recommend therefore that the establishment of theCommittee should be deferred for the moment but that I should, as ODconcluded, continue with the necessary preparatory work on compositionand terms of reference.    We shall of course go on making it clear to ourfriends that we do mean what we say in committing ourselves to themaintenance and improvement of a humanitarian regime in the prisons.6. On politics, we should cease to look for the prior agreement of theNorthern Ireland parties on political development, and should set up aNorthern Ireland Advisory Council by administrative act (our legislativeprogrammo being c/er-full already), drawn from people already elected inother capacities (eg district councillors, Members of Parliament andMembers of the European Parliament), the purpose being to make at leasta first move towards involving Ulstermen in the governance of theProvince.    I attach at Annex A a note setting this proposal out in moredetail.7. Because we shall not be seeking the agreement of the NorthernIreland parties, who will find the absence of any directJy elected element inthe Council unattractive, it becomes of particular importance to get theapproval of Parliament for this course.    The annual debate on the renewalof the present constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland (due totake place in the Commons on 2 July and in the Lords about a week later)would be an appropriate occasion for this.    I would propose to include thesubstance of Annex A in my opening speech to the House of Commons andmake it clear that it was on this basis that the Government was asking theHouse to approve the Order renewing the existing statutory arrangementsfor 12 months.    A similar procedure would follow in the House of Lordsand thus Parliament would have given its approval in the light of what I andthe Lords spokesman had said.    I would proceed thereafter to discussdetailed arrangements with representatives of the Northern Ireland parties.We would then reaffirm our commitment in The Queen&apos;s Speech for the nextSession of Parliament, with an accompanying White Paper, Parliamentaryapproval then being obtained in the vote in the Debate on the Address. TheCouncil could be in business by the end of the year, a year earlier than ifwe proceeded by way of legislation and an election.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8. I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; agreement toi. the establishment of an independent Committee to advise meon the long-term problems of Northern Ireland prisons, on thebasis set out in paragraphs 4 and 5; andii. setting up administratively an Advisory Council for NorthernIreland, on the basis described in paragraphs 6 and 7 and inAnnex A and to my announcing this in the debate on the renewal ofpowers for direct rule.H ANorthern Ireland Office23 June 19813CONFIDENTIAL
Confidential)annex aPolitical Development1.     Since it came into   office two years ago the present Government has pursuedwith vigour the search for arrangements to give the people of Northern Irelanda greater say in the running of the Province.   Following exhaustive discussionsduring 1980 with Northern Ireland political leaders HMG has been driven to concludethat it is not at present possible to confer legislative or executive powers ofgovernment upon a representative Northern Ireland body on a basis acceptable toboth parts of the community.   Accordingly it is necessary to consider (as wasforeshadowed in paragraph 6&apos;i &apos;of Cmnd 7950) a more gradual approach, under whicha representative body would be set up which did not at the outset, possess suchpowers.?.     In HMG&apos;s view the sotting up of such a body should now&apos;be carried forwardas a- matter of urgency.   The legislative and other provisions needed in orderto establish a directly elected body would impose an excessive delay - possiblyof 18 months or more.   HMG therefore proposes setting up a representative AdvisoryCouncil. - which, at least initially, would be composed of persons elected by thevoters of Northern Ireland to other representative bodies: Parliament atWestminster, the European Parliament, and the 2(i Northern Ireland DistrictCouncils.    HMG envisages a Council composed of some     50 representativeschosen from these elected sources.3 The method of appointment would be that the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland would invite Northern Ireland political parties to nominate a specifiednumber of nersons to serve on the Advisory Council, the numbers from each p^rtybeing based upon the recent District Council Elections.t.     Members of the Advisory Council, invited to serve on the above basis, wouldbe paid an attendance allowance. The Secretary of State wouldprovide appropriate facilities for the Council to meet at Parliament Buildings,Stormont.   It would be for the Council, to decide upon its own proceduresincluding whether it should deliberate in public.   / The Secretary of State wouldRPPoint an independent chairman to chair the preliminary meetings of the Councilin which it would settle its own rules of procedure. /
(coni [ en1 al)5.     The Secretary of State would invite the Advisory Council:(a) to consider and report to the Secretary of State on theactivities of Northern Ireland government departments inthe &quot;transferred&quot; area (ie those aspects of governmentwhich were not &quot;excepted&quot; or &quot;reserved&quot; under the provisionsof the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973) and on anyother matters which the Secretary of State may refer to them; forthese purposes he would make relevant, information available to theCouncil; the Council would be expected to divide itself whenappropriate into representative committees;(b) to tender advice to the Secretary of State on proposals forlegislation affecting Northern Ireland;(c) to consider what proposals for the exercise of legislative andexecutive powers by elected representatives would commandwidespread acceptance in both parts of the community.6      Thus, in each case the Council would be advisory only.    Tne Secretaryof State would,when appropriate, report their advice to Parliament and in doingso,   would   indicate   whether   or   not that   advice was unanimous or,failing that, commanded widespread support from representatives of both partsof the community. The Advisory Council would be encouraged to adopt proceduresthat made it clear to what extent its views commanded such support.   While thesetting up of committees, distribution of chairmanships etc would (in a bodycreated by executive act and not by statute) be within the Council&apos;s owndiscretion, the Secretary of State would make it clear that he would expect themembership of those Committees broadly to reflect the strength of the partiesin the Advisory Council as a whole .HMG now intends to carry forward detailed arrangements for the settingUP 01 the new Advisory Council, with a view to its being able to meet in theautumn of 19S1.   As part of this process the Secretary of State will wish todiscuss these plans with representatives of the Northern Ireland politicalParties, and if necessary to adjust the details of its proposals in the lightof their comments..LP.
(confidential^8.     HMG sees the establishment of the Advisory Council as a first step along theroad to responsible representative government in Northern Ireland.The Government envisages that the next step would involve establishing anassembly on a directly elected basis, an&apos;? progressively conferring upon itexecutive and legislative powers.22 June 1981-3-
