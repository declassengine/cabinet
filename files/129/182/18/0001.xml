* The Prime Minister&apos;s statement has been published asCmnd.^&quot;   JMembership of the European Communities: Statement by thePrime Minister, the Right Honourable Harold Wilson MP, tothe House of Commons on 2 May 1967 (Cmnd 3269; May 1967).Treaty concerning the Accession of the Kingdom of Denmark,Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland to the European economic community and the European Atomic Energy Community, and decision of the Council of the European Communities concern-ing the Accession of the said States to the European Coal andSteel Community; Cmnd 4862, January 1972.1.  introduction.1.     On. 18 March 1975 the Prime Minister announced inParliament that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had decided torecommend the British people to vote in the referendum infavour of staying in the European Community*.1.2.     On 2 May 1967 the Labour Government of the dayapplied for membership of the Community.    The Prime Ministerset out the reasons which had led.   to the application in**the statement which he made on that day in Parliament1.3.      It was not until the Summit Conference of the sixHeads of Government of the Community in the Hague inDecember 1969 that the way was opened for consideration of theapplication.    The Labour Government began preparations for theforthcoming negotiations.    Following the General election in June 1970, a Conservative Government conducted the nego-tiations relating to British membership leadiaig to theTreaty of Accession     ,
The United Kingdom and the European Communities (Cmnd 4715:July 1971).Renegotiation of the terms of entry into the european economic Community: Text of a Statement delivered by theSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs inthe Council of Ministers of the European Communities in luxembourg on 1 April 1974 (Cmnd 5593: April 1974).1.4.     The terms which the Conservative Government obtainedwere presented to Parliament in July 1971 &apos; .    Throughoutthe debate which followed, the Labour Opposition made clearits view that they fell short in certain key respects of whata Labour Government would have been prepared to accept.    Inhis speech to the House of Commons on 27 October 1971,Mr Wilson, as Leader of the Opposition, stated that &quot; theterms .... involve an intolerable and disproportionate burden on every family in the land and equally, on Britain&apos;s balanceof payments&quot;.    He reaffirmed that &quot;we saw great advantage in getting into Europe if the terms were right, but that, if theterms were wrong ..... Britain was strong enough to standoutside and prosper&quot;.    On balance the terms were not accepta-ble and once Labour were returned to power, &quot;..... we would&apos;ask for negotiations to be reopened so as to get the right and acceptable terms&quot;,- - ii1.5..     The improvements which the Labour Party sought werespelled out in their Manifesto for the General Election inFebruary 1974.    On being returned to power on the basis ofthis Manifesto, the Labour Government immediately set in hand the process of renegotiation, making it clear that &quot;if we are successful in achieving the right terms, we shall put them toour people for approval&quot;.     The Labour Manifesto of October1974 confirmed the renegotiation objectives and committed the
Government to giving the British People the final say, throughthe ballot box, on whether we accept the terms and stay in orreject the terms and come out.1.6.      The Government decided to negotiate as far as possilbe within the Community Treaties and therefore to seek our objectives by securing agreement to changes in the policies and decisions of the Community provided that our essential interests could be met in that. way.    Regular reports on theprogress of renegotiation were made to Parliament.    The white paper &quot;Developments in the European Communities March to october 1974&apos;? recorded the main developments in renegotiationand other matters in the Community over that period.    our objectives were principally pursued in the course of theCommunity&apos;s normal programme of work.    They were also consid-ered in the meetings of Heads of Government in Paris inDecember 1974 and in Dublin in March 1975.    After the Dublinmeeting the Prime Minister announced in Parliament that thediscussions within the Community on renegotiation had beentaken as far as they could go.*   Cmnd 5790: November 197k
THE RENEGOTIATED TERMS2.1     This Chapter describes the outcome of renegotiation on eachof the seven objectives outlined in the Labour Party Manifestoof February 1974.-
2.2.       FOOD AND AGRICULTURERenegotiation Objective2.2.1.   The February Manifesto undertook to Becure:&quot;major changes in the common agricultural policy so thatit ceases to be a threat to world trade in food products,and so that low cost producers outside Europe can continueto have access to the British food market&quot;.Oat come2.2.2.   To Secure the supply of food at far prices, common agricultural Policy (CAP) price levels have been held down in real terms; they are being more closely related to the needs of efficient producers, and towards securing a better balance between supply and demand.2,2.3*   Greater flexibility to meet special circumstances and an improved marketing system for beef have been secured.   There hasbeen an increased willingness to adjust the price structure tothe varying needs of different parts of the Community, and in theuse of direct subsidies to producers in place of higher endprices.   For beef member states have the option of maintainingreturns to producers by means of deficiency payments, which allowconsumers to obtain their supplies at lower prices when supplies are plentiful, instead of maintaining producer prices by stockpilingbeef in cold stores.2.2.4t   Progress has been made in discouraging the creation of surplus stocks and further measures to discourage surplusproduction of milk products and cereals will be considered inthe stocktaking of the CAP which is being undertaken.   Theinterests of consumers have been given priority both in thedisposal of surpluses and in overcoming scarcities.   Consumersubsidies have been given by the Community for beef and increasedfor butter.   British consumers have also benefited from importsubsidies on a wide range of foodstuffs and from measures to keepCommunity prices below world prices.   In particular the Communityhas subsidised the importation of sugar into the UK.
2.2.5.   Financial control of Community expenditure is beingstrengthened.2.2.6.   Access to the Community has been secured for up to 1.4m tonsof sugar from the Commonwealth developing countries on favourable terms and for an indefinite period.   Progress has also been madeon improving the arrangements for continued access for New Zealanddairy products after 1977o   Improvements on access for otherfoodstuffs have been secured in a number of general trade negotiations.Further improvements in access, for example for hard wheat and lamb, will be pursued in current trade negotiations.2.2.7.   The stocktaking of the CAP,which is ourrently in hand willprovide the opportunity to secure further improvements.2,2.8.   As a result of changes in the world food situation and theprogress achieved in renegotiation the Government believe thatthe CAP can be operated flexibly in the enlarged Community andin a way which meets the needs of consumers and producers.   further improvements in the CAP are foreshadowed and it should bepossible to contain the net cost within reasonable limits,,   On   hbalance food prices in the UK have recently been no higher thanthey would have been had we remained outside the Community.   Futurefood price trends are uncertain but the prospect is for continuation of higher world prices, and membership of the Community, which isa major food producer, offers greater stability of price levels and security of supply in times of shortage.Details2.2.9.   The United Kingdom as a major food importer traditionallysought to obtain its imported supplies at low prices from commonwealth and other third countries.   In this way consumersbenefited from low market prices when world supplies wereplentiful, while our producers received deficiency payments tobring their returns from the market up to a higher guaranteedlevel needed to sustain home production.   We also protected our market by putting a floor in prices through quantitative restrictions, duties or levies on imports of some commoditiessuch as cereals, butter, bacon, beef and lamb, or through domesticsupport-buying for potatoes.
1    l &apos;   &quot;&apos;- :.2.2.10.   The original Community was much more self-sufficient.The benefit from cheap imports would therefore have been much lessthan for the United Kingdom and the cost of relying principally on direct subsidies would have been much higher.   Consequently the six relied primarily on duties and levies on imports and on supportbuying of domestic supplies to maintain producers&apos; returns.The price levels in the Community were high by comparison withthe prices guaranteed to our producers and still more by comparisonwith world prices.2.2.11.   Because of these differences, United Kingdom agricultural policy and the CAP have struck a different balance in assuringconsumers of adequate supplies at reasonable prices and assuringproducers of reasonable returns.   The previous Administrationsought to provide for the necessary adjustment to conditions ina more self-sufficient Community by means of a five-year transitional period in the Treaty of Accession.   The Labour Government took theview that this was inadequate without substantial changes in the cap itself.2.2.12.   Our main objection to the CAP was that it maintained high prices to domestic producers at the expense of consumers and over-seas suppliers.   As it happened, British entry into the Communitycoincided with a marked increase in the general level of world food prices and a serious scarcity of some commodities.   This was followed by accelerated world-wide inflation resulting from the oil crisis.   United Kingdom import prices more than doubled, andin some cases world prices rose above Community prices.   agricultural prices will always fluctuate, but it seems likely that the general level of world food prices will remain higher relative to otherprices than in the past.   Producers in all countries have to bearhigher costs; world demand for food is growing with risingpopulations and living standards; and exporting countries havelearned that they can insist on Higher export earnings.Objectives2.2.13. Against this background the Government formulated their detailed objectives in statements in the Council of Ministers on
4 and 18 June 1974*   They accepted that the aim of the community should be to produce as much of its food requirements as it could provide efficiently and economically, and that agricultural support should be maintained at realistic levels.   They recognisedthat the CAP could provide assured supplies for consumers at knownprices in a world where both price and availability could beunpredictable; and that world prices were likely to be more in line with Community prices than in the past.   They concluded thatthe interests of Britain as a large consumer could be met withinthe principles of Community preference, free circulation of goods and Community financing, provided that some major changes weremade in:(i)   the general operation of the CAP and of its support systems for particular commodities, and(ii)   arrangements for trade with third countries.These changes, and the results obtained, are set out in paragraphs.2.14-2.2.22 below.General operation of the CAP aad^f its support systems2.2.14.   The Government asked for the cost of the CAP to be restrainedby fixing farm prices on the basis of objective criteria designedto meet the needs of efficient farms and to maintain a properbalance between supply and demand.   In the determination of community farm prices during the renegotiation period the council has based its decisions on the Commissions proposals, which havetaken increasing account of the needs of efficient farms and thebalance of supply and demand for individual commodities.   Thisbenefits both consumers and taxpayers and reduces the risk of surplus production.   It has reinforced the tendency of some yearsstanding for e.c. prices to be reduced in real terms.   BetweenI968/9 and 1974/5. for instance, the Community price in real terms for soft wheat fell by 27 per cent?   for maize&apos;-.the price fellby-v.24&apos;per. -cent? for beeT otbe pride: fell !.;by&apos;7-:per. cent j for butterthe -$rite- - e L fty -34 &apos;P$J? &apos; canty ---and: fop sugar&apos; the. price fell by 29 percent.   For all these commodities except beef the world market pricesrose substantially&apos;in real terms over the same period.
2.2.15o   The Government sought greater flexibility in the operationof the CAP.   In particular they sought urgent changes in the beefregime.   These have now been secured and represent an importantstep in the reform of the CAP.   The Community had been buying uplarge quantities of surplus beef in order to maintain market prices for producers, and consumers were consequently being denied theopportunity of buying cheaper beef and increasing their consumption.   An alternative system has now been agreed, initiallyfor a year, under which member states are no longer obliged tomaintain high prices by support buying.   Instead they can allow consumersto buy their beef at lower market prices while paying direct subsidies to their producers to bring their returns from the market up to the desired level.   These subsidies are partly financed by theCommunity,,   Under this system, which is being applied in theUnited Kingdom, support buying is used only to prevent a completecollapse in the market.   It gives producers the assurance of the adequate returns they need to maintain supplies without forcingconsumers to pay unacceptably high prices; and it avoids excessivestockpiling of frozen beef.2.2.16.   The Government also asked that in fixing prices the community should take more account of the differences in market circumstances in different parts of the Community; that separate provision shouldbe made for assistance to the less viable farms; and that direcxaids to producers should be used more readily.   During the renegotiationprovision on these lines has been secured in the following ways:(a) There have been adjustments in monetary arrangementsallowing different percentage price increases in differentmember states.(b) Special encouragement to British sugar beet production has been given by means a? an exceptional increase in the producer price and a greatly enlarged production quota.(c) Provision has been made for direct aids in the UnitedKingdom and other countries partly financed by the Community.Arrangements have been made for Community assistance to less /viable farms by the introduction of a system of special aidsto less-favoured areas, including our own hill areas.   Inaddition the Community has aocepted the need on a numberof occasions for member states to give national aids in
various sectors including f^hgries and horticulture,and in the United Kingdom/pigmeat and beef sectors inparticular.2.2.17.   The Government asked that measures should be taken to discourage surplus production; that consumers should be given greaterpriority in the disposal of any surpluses that did arise; and that greater priority should be given to the interests of consumers in themanagement of the Community market generally.   During the renegotiationconsumers have benefitted from the downward pressure on real prices(paragraph 2.2.14 above); and where world prices have been higher thanCommunity prices, Community preference has operated to keep down prices to consumers at the expense of producers.   Moreover, in the followingspecific ways greater priority has been given to consumers1 interestsin the management of the Community markets-(a) The technique of holding down support buying prices at times of surplus has been applied in the beef sector, where the -need was most urgent.   The Community has subsidised the saleof beef to pensioners and contributes to the premiums whichallow beef to be sold for eonsumption instead of being boughtinto store by the Community.(b) In the milk products sector - the principal area inwhich there is a structural surplus problem - the commission has tabled suggestions for encouraging a better balance between production and consumption in time of surplus.   TheGovernment will also pursue similar improvements in the cereals sector.     The Community has increased its contributionto the consumer subsidy on butter.(c) United Kingdom consumers benefit from subsidies on food imports paid by the Community to countries withdepreciating currencies,(d) The payment of national consumer subsidies in the UK hasnot been questioned,(e) The Community has accepted the obligation to maintainsupplies of sugar for Community consumers by buying supplies on the world market and selling them to consumers at thelower Community price.   So far United Kingdom refiners and manufacturers have purchased 170,000 tons of sugar underthese arrangements with the aid of Community subsidiestotalling  36 million.
2.2.18.   The Government asked that financial control of Community-expenditure on agriculture should be strengthened.   Improved estimates of the costs and budgetary implications of new proposals are being provided and monitoring of actual expenditure has been tightened.Steps are also being taken to improve precautions against fraud.The Government also asked that more effective and economical support arrangements for olive oil and durum wheat should be introduced.The Community has not yet undertaken this revision but the matterwill be considered again shortly.   Meanwhile aids in these sectorshave been restricted to their existing levels.Trade with third countries.2.19.   The Government asked that there should be improvements inaccess to the Community market for food imports from third countries.In particular they asked for adequate and continuing access for commonwealth sugar linked to assurances of supply at prices fairly andrealistically related to Community prices.   The Community guaranteedaccess for the quantities offered upto 1.4m tons of sugar per annumfrom the Commonwealth developing countries for an indefinite period at prices which will be negotiated annually and will be related tothe prices paid to Community producers (see paragraph 2.7.5.).   these arrangements are at least as good for the Commonwealth producers asthose of the CSA, and they provide a valuable assurance of supplies for our consumers and cane refineries.2.2.20.   The Government also asked for satisfactory arrangements for continuing access for New Zealand dairy products after 1977*Protocol 18 of the Accession Treaty laid down arrangements for importsof New Zealand butter and cheese until the end of 1977&apos;   While notruling out special arrangements for imports of butter thereafter, it made no satisfactory provision for a continuing relationship betweenNew Zealand and the Community, and the price arrangements in the Protocolwere inadequate.   In the autumn of 1974, we secured an increase of18 per cent in the prices paid to New Zealand to ensure continuedsupplies.   In March 1975* &quot;the Heads of Government, meeting in Dublin,issued a Declaration of Principle which provides for the annualimports of butter for the next 3-year period 1978/1980 to remainclose to deliveries in 1974 and 1975o   It accepts the need for aperiodic review and, as necessary, adjustment of the prices received
by New Zealand.   The Dublin meeting invited the Commission to produceas soon as practicable, a proposal for special import arrangementsfor butter to apply after 1977.   It was agreed that the special problem relating to access after 1977 for cheese, which is not provided for in the Protocol, should be considered urgently.   all this represents a signficant improvement on the provision inProtocol 18.   The New Zealand Government has welcomed the progress made at the Dublin meeting.2.2.21.   The Government proposed various other improvements inaccess for third country foodstuffs, putting forward North Americanhard wheat, lard, palm oil and some processed foods, as examples of products which needed less protection.   Improvements have been secured on lard; and, in various trade negotiations, on a number ofother products (see paragraphs 2.7*7*1 2.7.8., 2,7.13. and 2,7.14below).   Nevertheless, further improvements are required.   Inparticular we shall seek improved access for certain other importantfoodstuffs such as lamb, hard wheat and bread flour.   For beef weshall seek new and more stable arrangements in order to allowreasonable access for imports from third countries whilst adequatelysafeguarding the position of our producers.   We can expect toobtain further improvements in access for third country foodstuffsin the course of current trade negotiations.Community stocktaking of the CAP2.2.22.   During the period of renegotiation agreement was reached between member states that a full-scale re-appraisal of the CAP was required.   This view was strongly supported by the United Kingdom andthe Commission has now submitted a report on which decisions will betaken during the coming months.   The report holds out prospectsboth of further progress on the lines already advocated by theUnited Kingdom and of other improvements which we can welcome.   Inparticular it confirms the importance of fixing prices related to theneeds of modern farms and the balance of supply and demanda   Thereis further recognition of the need for arrangements to discouragesurplus production, and the need tb&apos; control budgetary costs.   Thepi priorityreport also endorses the principle/cor consumers at time of surplusproduction, and advocates greater use of consumer subsidies.   The need to take more account of third country interests is recognised)particularly in relation to the GATT multilateral trade negotiations.
conclusion.2.23,   Our main objection to the CAP was that it maintained highmarket prices to Community producers at the expense of consumers and overseas suppliers, whereas we kept market prices down by obtainingour imports as cheaply as possible from overseas suppliers andsubsidising our producers.   But we can no longer rely on cheapoverseas supplies.   World prices have risen sharply and food prices in the UK have recently been no higher on balance that they would havebeen if we had remained outside the Community.   The future relationship between world prices and Community prices is uncertain.   But theyare likely to be much closer together than in the past and thereare likely to be sharp fluctuations both in price and in the availability of supplies on world markets.2,2.24.   In these circumstances the Government has concentrated onseeking specific changes in the operation of the CAP system, and substantial progress has been made.   Experience of negotiatingwithin the framework of the CAP has shown that it can be made to operate flexibly and to respond to changing conditions and the needsof both consumers and producers in the different parts of theerlarged Community.   In addition substantial progress has been madein improving the terms of access to the Community market for overseas suppliers.   These developments are in accordance with the aim ofthe October Manifesto:   &quot;to make sure shoppers get secure suppliesof food at fair prices&quot;.2,2,25.   The CAP still has some unsatisfactory features, but thestocktaking that is being undertaken offers the prospect of further improvements of the kind we want to see.   Because our agricultural industry is relatively small we are likely to remain net contributorsto the cost of the CAP, but we should now be able to contain thecost within reasonable limits.   And there will be benefits,  notablygreater^s^bility of price and&apos; security &quot;of-supply iffdr.. our. aonsumersand StabilPt^co-F^uplpOrt &quot;for our: Jprd^ceffs, ;oa whom we -rely. for.&quot;.tKe\o;v.major part of our supplies.
2.3     THE COMMUNITY BUDGETRenegotiation Objective2.3.1.     Tho February Manifesto stated that one object of the ronogo-fcia-tionwould he &quot;new and fairer methods&quot; of financing the Community budget.   Itsaid:   &quot;Neither the taxes that form the so-called &quot;own resources&quot; of the communities, nor tho purposes, mainly agricultural support, on which the funds are mainly to be spent, are acceptable to us.     We would be ready tocontribute to Community finances only such sums as were fair in relation towhat is paid and received by other countries.&quot;Outcome2.3.2.   a.     At the meeting of Community Heads of Government in Dublin on10-11 March, we secured agreement on a budget correcting mechanism which willprovide a refund to the United Kingdom if in any year our contribution to theCommunity budget goos significantly beyond what is fair in relation to our share of Community GNP.b.    Much has already been achieved, and further progress can beexpected, in containing Community expenditure on agricultural support andin the development of expenditure policies more beneficial to theUnited Kingdom.Details2.3.3.   The e.c. Treaty envisaged the establishment in due course of asystem under which the Community would control its own financial resources.This &quot;own resources&quot; system was adopted by the Council on 21 April 1970.It provided for the Community to draw a progressively greater proportion offinance directly from the revenue of customs duties and of levies on agricultural imports.     The original six member states already pay these
resources in full to the Community.     If the amounts aro not sufficientto moet the Community,s revenue requirements, it is entitled to call upona proportion (equivalent to a rate of up to 1 per cent) of the proceeds of a Value Added Tax, levied on a uniform basis.    However pendingagreement on a uniform VAT assessment base, tho shortfall is made upby member states1 contributions, determined according to thoir respectiveshares of the Gross National Product of tho whole Community.    The &quot;own resources&quot; system was approved by tho Parliaments of the member states.No further taxes can be transferred to the Community without a furtherformal agreement between tho member states which would require parliamentary approval.2.3.4.   The Conservative Government accepted these arrangements when theynegotiated for membership, subject to tho transitional arrangements setout in the 1971 White paper.    Under those terms, Britain contributed to the Community budget in accordance with a fixed percentage key startingat 8.78 per cent in 1973 and rising to 19.24 per cent in 1977.     This, itwas held, was &quot;broadly comparable to our proportion of the Gross national product of the enlarged Community.&quot;    Thoreafter, for two further years, thegrowth of the British contribution would be limited by correctives.    That isto say, in 1978 our contribution would not increase above- that for 1977 bymore than 2/5ths of any difference between what we would have paid in 1977under the full system of &quot;own resources&quot; and our actual contribution in thatyear.     In 1979 the increase over 1978 would be similarly limited.    TheWhite Paper estimated that these arrangements would result in a net United kingdom contribution of  200 million in 1977, at 1971 prices.    After that date,however, tho White Paper concluded that reliable forecasts were not possiblebecause of a large number of unpredictable factors.2,3.5* The Labour Party consistently took the view that application of thesystem to the United Kingdom would result in a growing drain on our balanceof payments which the country could not afford. This would happen becausecustoms duties and agricultural levies are chargeable on imports from third countries; and they would inevitably fall most heavily on those countries with a continuing high lovel of trade with the rest of the world, such ast&apos;Cmnd 4715:   July 1971, paragraphs 91-96
tho Unitod Kingdom.     Nor could the United Kingdom oxpoct to receive backreceipts commensurate with our contribution because of the high proportion of Community expenditure devoted to agriculture.     Thoagricultural sector in the United Kingdom is significantly smaller thanin othor member states of the Community.     Tho Labour Party saw no justification for the high degree of reliance which the conservative government placed on an early and extensive- diversification of Communityexpenditure towards technological, industrial and regional policies fromwhich, unliko agriculture, Britain could expect to receive money backcommensurate with her contribution to the budget.2.3.6.   On 1 April 1974 the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary made clear toother member governments in the Council of Ministers in the Council that&quot;fundamental changes are required.     Britainfs income per head and her rateof growth is lower than in many of your countries.     I take it you would agree that the out-turn of the Community budget should not in all justiceresult in massive subsidies across the exchanges from my -country to yours.This is not acceptable. &quot;*The New Budgetary Arrangements2.3.7*   The Government therefore sought an arrangement to ensure that theUnited Kingdom would not have to pay a disproportionate contribution to thoCommunity budget.     At tho mooting of Community Heads of Government in Dublinon 10/11 March agreement was reached on arrangements which, though complex,will result in a repayment to the United Kingdom if in any year our contributiongoos significantly beyond what is fair in relation to our sharo of totalCommunity GNP.     Tho arrangements will apply to any member state thatqualifies under the following criteria:-i. having gross national product per head less than 85 per cent of the Community average;ii. having a real rate of growth loss than 120 per cent of theCommunity average 5*Cmnd 5593, April 1974:   paragraph 11.
iii. having to contribute &quot;ovm resources&quot; amounting in total to ashare of the Community budget greater than 110 per cent of the member state&apos;s share of Community GNP;iv. having a &quot;net potential foreign exchange liability&quot; (ie an excessof contributions over direct receipts) as a result of the operation ofthe Community budget.The first two of these criteria will be calculated on the basis of a three-year moving average.2.3.8.   Mien these qualifications are met, reimbursement will be calculatedaccording to a sliding scale, under which there will be no reimbursement inrespect of any excess contributions between 100 and 105 per cent of the member state&apos;s GNP share, but thereafter an increasing proportion will be refunded, reaching 100 per cent for an excess contribution of over 130 per cent of GNP share.   The total reimbursement under the mechanism will be limited bythe lowest of three alternative ceilings -a. 250 million units of account (approximately  125 million at current market rates), orb. the &quot;net potential foreign exchange liability&quot;   of the member state as a result of its contributions to the budget, orc   the size of the member state&apos;s VAT contribution (or GNP-relatedfinancial contribution).The limitation at a. will be adjusted upwards if the total budget expenditurerises above 8,000 million units of account, being fixed at an amountrepresenting 3 per cent of total budget expenditure.   There is a furtherlimitation in that if, on a basis of a 3-year moving average, the balance on current account of the member state in question is in surplus, the correctionwill be related only to the difference between the share of VAT payments(or financial contribution) and the member state&apos;s share of Community GNP.
2.3.9.     There are two provisions for review:a. if a member state receives a refund for three successive years,the Community will consider what more needs to be done; and b. the working of the arrangements will be reviewed after an initial trial period of 7 years.2.3*10.   The United Kingdom is expected to qualify under the criteria outlined in paragraph 2.3.7 above in 1977 or 1978 and in subsequent years; and can therefore expect a refund on its contributions rising to a total figure ofabout  125 million a year.   The precise amounts are impossible to predictbecause they depend on a wide range of unknown factors.   But the assurance of a refund if our contribution goes significantly beyond our GNP sharerepresents, in the Government&apos;s view, a major improvement in the terms of our membership of the Community.Receipts2.3.11.   Membership of the Community involves receipts from its budget as wellas payments.   The following table shows the United kingdom&apos;s contributions,receipts and net contributions to the Community budget in 1973, 1974 and1975 as compared with the forward estimates made of our net contribution in1971.197319741975(estimated)CrossContributions181179305.  , NetRecexpts   Contllbutions77148230-2401043165-75  millions1971 estimates of Net iContributions145165205Receipts almost doubled between 1973 and 1974, mainly through an increase inUnited Kingdom receipts under the Community1s agricultural arrangements (FEOCA),For this reason, and because of some special factors on the contribution side,net contributions were reduced from over  100 million to only  31 million.
2.3.12.     The question of the purposes on which the Community budget is spent has to be considered against this background, and in the light ofthe agreement that contributions should be adjusted by reference to GNPshares.    It nonetheless remains important to contain the cost to theUnited Kingdom of Community expenditure on agricultural support withinacceptable limits.   Much has already been achieved in this area (see paragraphs 2.2.13-2.2.16 above) and further progress can be expected.Equally, should British membership of the Community be confirmed, theGovernment will continue to work for Community expenditure policies fromwhich this country could expect to benefit - for example, the arrangements forsubsidising British imports of sugar which were negotiated in 1975.   Theagreement on the Regional Development Fund represents another useful step inthis direction.2.3.13&quot;    In dealing with the impact of the budgetary system the Governmenthave concentrated on its practical effects on the United Kingdom and havenot insisted on changes in the type of contributions collected from member countries.   From the outset of the renegotiation the Government consideredthat the form&apos; of the original contributions would be much less importantonce an effective mechanism was superimposed on them to ensure that refundswould be available if Britain&apos;s contribution went significantly beyond whatis fair in relation to our share of Community GNP.   This is what has been achieved.
2.4.      ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNIONRenegotiation Objective2.4.1.   The February Manifesto said:   &quot;We would reject any kind of inter-national agreement which compelled us to accept increased unemployment forthe sake of maintaining a fixed parity, as is required by current proposalsfor a European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).   We believe that the monetary problems of the European countries can be resolved only in aworl d-wide f ramework.&quot;Outcome2.4.2,   a.     Events have shown that the programme for movement towards fullEMU by 1980, which was laid down in 1972 at the Community Heads of Governmentmeeting in Paris^ was over-ambitious and unattainable.   In practice othermembers of the Community accept this.if. Closer co-operation between Communi-by countries in the economic and monetary fields is valuable and presents no threat to employment in theUnited Kingdom.Details2.4.3-   Before the accession of the United Kingdom to the Community, the six.,original Member States had paid much attention to tho possibility of moving towards EM.   In resolutions adopted in March 1971 and March 1972 they approvedan ambitious plan to achieve such a Union by 1980.   This programme was endorsed by the Summit Meeting in Paris in October 1972 attended by Mr Heath as :Prime Minister.2.4.4&apos;   In his statement to the Council of Ministers on 1 April 1974*, theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary expressed deep concern about the content of the resolutions of March 1971 and 1972.   He pointed out that they seemed to lay down a rigid programme under which EMU, including permanently fixed paritiesbetween the exchange rate of member states1 currencies, would be achieved by*Cmnd   5593, April 1974:   paragraphs 6-7.22
196*0.   He stated that this seemed to he dangerously over-ambitious: over-ambitious because the chances of achieving by 1980 the requisite degree ofconvergence in the rates of growth of productivity and wage rates, of investment and savings, seemed to us to bo very small: dangerous becauseof the impossibility in any country, particularly a country with a relatively low growth rate, to manage its own economy efficiently and provide for full employment if it accepted permanently fixed parities without such convergencehaving been achieved.    The Foreign Secretary referred to the new thinkingwhich was going on in the Community on the subject of EMU and noted that theproposals under consideration for a second stage of EMU did not providefor automatic movement towards permanently fixed parities.   He indicated that our objections would be very much lessoned if all could agree thatthere could be no question of trying to force the pace^ of compellingmember countries to accept permanently fixed parities if this meantaccepting massive unemployment or before their economies were ready.2.2f. 5.   Events, both in Europe and in the world as a whole, have clearly shown the unreality of the programme adopted in 1971 and 1972 for progress by stagesto full EMU by 198O.   One of the key elements in the programme was that thereshould be a limited margin of fluctuation bet?/een currencies of member states(the arrangement known as the &quot;snake&quot;).   Several member countries of theCommunity have withdrawn from this arrangement in the last two years.   Moreover,the resolution covering the second stage of EMU, which was due to have begun in January 1974, has never been formally adopted.   The goal of EMU is stillregarded in the Community as a valid, though distant objective, and was endorsed by the Paris Heads of Government meeting in December 1974; but there is growingawareness that the original blueprint for attaining EMU by 1980 is impracticableand Heads of Government in 1974 tacitly discarded the stages for progress towardsEMU which were endorsed by the Paris Summit in 1972.2,4.6.   The Government acknowledge the importance and value of close consultation and co-operation with other member states on economic and monetary questions.Such consultation has provided a good foundation for joint action by the member states on those questions in wider international groupings.   This is fully inaccordance with the Manifesto objective of seeking to deal with monetaryproblems in a world-wide framework, without excluding co-operation among themembers of the Community.   Any further discussions which may be held on progress&apos;towards closer economic and monetary unity in the Community will
take place in a changed situation now that the over-aribitious 1971 and 1972proposals are no longer being put into effect.   The Government will ho readyto consider any now proposals on their morits.   They do not accept anycomitmont to maintain a fixed parity other than in circumstances of theirchoosing.   Against this background, tho Government consider that the manifesto objectives have been not.
2.5    REGIONAL, INDUSTRIAL AND FISCAL POLICIESObjective2.5*1&apos;     The Government&apos;s objective, as set out in the February 1974Manifesto, was to ensure the &quot;retention by Parliament of those powers overthe British economy needed to pursue effective regional,:industrial andfiscal policies&quot;.Outcome2.5-2.     a.     Regional Policy.     New principles for the co-ordination of regional aids within the Community will allow the United Kingdom to continueto pursue affective regional policies adjusted to the particular needs of individual areas of the country.     The Communication setting out these principles acknowledges that national governments are the bestjudges of what is required in their own countries, and that changes in national aid sustems will not be regarded as incompatible with the common market when they are justified by problems of employment, unemployment,migration or other valid requirements, subject to the condition that amember state&apos;s actions do not damage the interests of other member states.They in their turn accept a similar obligation not to damage our interests.b.    Industrial policy.   The Government are satisfied that their policies foraid to industry generally, their nationalisation proposals, and the establishmentof the National Enterprise Board and of Planning Agreements will not be hampered by Treaty obligations.c*    Steel.     In tho particular case of steel, it has been established that neither the Commission nor the United Kingdom now has powers to control privatesoctor investment.     Tho Government consider that this situation is unsatisfactory,but the necessary study of means to secure control of private sector investmentcannot be completed within the renegotiation timetable.     They have informed the other member countries that if the United Kingdom remains a member of theCommunity, they will pursue this question in order to satisfy their practicalneed for control in this field.
Fiscal policy   The Government are satisfied that membership of theCommunity does not limit their powers to pursue effective fiscal policies.e.     The Government are satisfied that subject to the question of steel,which cannot bo completed yet, their renegotiation requirements have been met rDetailsRegional and Industrial Policies2.5.3.     The Government have been especially concerned about Articles 92-94of the SBC Treaty, which contain provisions about the admissibility ofstate assistance to industry.2.5.4.    Under Article 92 &quot;any aid ... which distorts ... competition byfavouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shallinsofar as it affects trade between Member States be incompatible with thecommon market&quot;.    However, the Article goes on to declare that certainforms of aid are compatible with the common market, for example, aid of a social character (including consumer subsidies) and aid to make good damage caused by natural disasters.     There are also four forms of aid which may be considered to be compatible:a, &quot;aid to promote the economic development of areas where thestandard of living is abnormally low or where there is seriousunder-employment&quot;,b, waid to promote the execution of an important project of commonEuropean interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State&quot;;c. &quot;aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activitiesor of certain economic areas, where such aid does not adversely affecttrading conditions to an extent contrary to ohe common interest&quot;;   and d. &quot;such other categories of aid as may be specified by the Council&quot;.
2.5.5    Member governments decide how they vri.ll give assistance to their industries and regions having regard to their Treaty obligations.Article 93 of the Treaty places on the Commission the duty in co-operation with member states to keep systems of aids under review and responsibility for deciding whether any particular forms of aid arecompatible with the common market having regard to the provisions of theTreaty.   In order to enable it to do this, member states have agreed inthe Treaty to inform the Commission in advance of their plans to grant oralter aid.   Decisions by the Commission may, at the instance of the member state concerned, be overruled by the CQuncil of Ministers actingunanimously and are also subject to review by the European Court of Justice.2.5.6    In his statement on 1 April to the Council of Hinisters*, theForeign and Commonwealth Seoretary said that the co-ordination of regionalaids within the - Community can usefully prevent overbidding for internationallyavailable funds.   The Government have no difficulty in accepting the needfor Community rules about the admissibility of state aids.   Such rules area feature of international agreements for customs unions and free tradeareas, for example, the European Free Trade Area Convention and the free trade agreements between the EFTA countries *jid tho Community.   Customsunions or free trade areas exist to enable goods to move freely between the member states in fair competition.   This competition could be distorted ifeach member state was free to give unlimited aids to its own firms, andthere would be a risk of a competitive bidding-up of aids between member states which would be contrary to the general interest.   Common rules canthus give a fairer deal to the less well off regions in the member states by preventing the more prosperous countries from attracting projects to themselves by offering higher aids, at the expense of the less prosperous.2.5.7    The Government also recognise the need for central administrative arrangements as described above to apply those rules.   The use of theCommission as a regulatory agency reflects the mod for a centraladministrative body in. an economic grouping of the size of the Community, inwhich there are many forms of state aid.   The powers entrusted to theCommission derive from and are to-be exercised in accordance with the Treaty,which lays down tho general rules.   The Government are satisfied that in operating these arrangements the institutions of the Community are responsoveto the essential needs of member-statesj indeed they must be so if theCommunity is to work effectively.*Cnnd 5593, April 1974:   paragraph 10.CONFIDENTIAL
Regional policy .5.8     In the case of regional aids tho formal position does not restsimply on the provisions of the Treaty.     Since 1957 there has &quot;been a fundamental evolution in Community thinking about the role which stateregional assistance should play in oach country.   It is now widely accepted that regional aids are a highly effective means of carrying outthe objective of the Treaty of &quot;roducing the differences existing betweentho various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions&quot;.Over the years, and following consultations between the Commission and the member governments, the impact of tho Treaty has been refined and clarified.2.5.9    In 1971, the Commission, in consultation with the member states,drew up principles setting out the way in which it proposed to apply the relevant provisions of the Treaty,   The member states passed a resolution in tho Council of ItLnistcrs approving tho Communication in which those principles wore set out.   The principles laid down the maximum amount of aid which might be granted to any project in the most prosperous areasof the Community and also defined what forms of aid were admissible inthose areas.   They wore extended to tho United Kingdom and the other new member countries under Article 154 of the Treaty of Accession, and inJune 1973, it was agroed that the Commission should prepare revisedprinciples for the whole of the enlarged Community,2.5.10   In his statement to tho Co^inoil of Ministers on 4 June 1974 theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary confirmed to the Community that theUnited Kingdom would play a full part in the work- of the working party which had boon sot up to study the now principles.   At the end of February 1975,following extensive consultations both in the working party and bilaterallywith the member governments, the Commission published a new communication which, like that of 1971, set out tho way in which the Commission proposefor the next three years to apply tho general provision of Article 92 oftho e.c. Treaty, that particular forms of regional aid may be consideredcompatible with the tommon market.   As in 1971, the Commission has invitodthe member governments to rocord their agreement to the principles sotout in the Communication by passing a Resolution in tho Council ofMinisters,
CONFIDENTIAL

2.5.11 The principal features of the new Communication are as follows-

a. The territory of the Community is divided into five categories, to each of which different detailed principles apply. The aim is that the least favoured areas of the Community should be eligible for the most help, and that they should be further protected by restricting the aid which Governments may give in the most prosperous areas. The hierarchy of assisted areas set out in the Communication takes in the United Kingdom&apos;s assisted areas without change. All present forms of United Kingdom regional aid are accepted under the communication; a derogation is being sought in respect of assistance given by the Highlands and Islands Development Board. No forms of national aid are ruled out in principle, and the Commission have given assurances that they will be ready where necessary, to authorise aids in excess of the general rules to deal with especially serious local problems.

b. The Commission acknowledge that national governments are the best judges of what is required in their own countries and that changes in national aid systems will not be regarded as incompatible with the common market when they are not against the general interest and are justified by problems of employment, unemployment, migration, or by other valid requirements of regional development policy which constitutes essential national problems.

c. The Commission further acknowledge that these regional problems may call for urgent action by Governments and that the Treaty procedures will not hold this up.

Industrial policy

2.5.12 The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary explained to the Council of Ministers on 4 June 1974, that the Government would be seeking from the Community assurances to set at rest fears that their plans for British industry, including the steel industry, might be hampered by unduly restrictive interpretations of the Treaties.


CONFIDENTIAL

2.5.13 Since that statement was made the Government have formulated in detail their plans for industry and these have now been published in the Industry Bill and in certain proposals for nationalisation. Article 222 of the EEC Treaty permits nationalisation; and we have established that Government participation in the equity of a firm does not in itself raise problems under the Treaty. The proposals for the National Enterprise Board and for Planning Agreements, which have much in common with arrangements in other Member States, are in no way incompatible with the Treaty provided that the government&apos;s powers are not exercised so as to damage the competitive position of undertakings in other member states. This accords with the Government&apos;s policy: the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary specifically recognised in his statement on 4 June 1974, the importance of having Community rules to ensure that none of the member states, in trying to solve their own problems, simply create problems for the others. The Government have discussed with the Commission our methods of offering financial assistance to individual firms and industries, having regard to the requirement emphasised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in his statement on 1 April* that in particular cases we must be able to give aid quickly and effectively where there is a need to sustain and develop valuable industrial capacity. We have reported significant cases of aid under the Industry Act. Our experience over the last year has shown that no difficulty need arise from emergency action in these cases. The Government would in any event have in mind that in rescue cases, a plan might be prepared for restoring firms, to viability; and they would discuss such plans with the Commission against the background of rules referred to above.

Steel industry

2.5.14 The coal and steel industries are covered by the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty signed at Paris in 1951, and not the EEC Treaty of 1957. The ECSC Treaty places on the Commission the task of

W0rk is also procooding within thoGonnrunity to establish, on a basis of unanimous agreement, harmonisedstructures of other forms of indirect taxation eg tho taxes onalcoholic drinks. - No proposals havo boon nado for harmonising ratesof indirect taxes.   Tho Government are satisfied that membership of thoCommunity in no way impairs tho retention by Parliament of the Powersnoodod to pursue effective fiscal policies.VA
2.6   CAPITAL MOVEMENTSRenegotiation Objective2.6.1     Tho February Manifesto said: &quot;Wo need an agreement on capital movements which protects our balance of payments and full employmentpolicios&quot;.Outcome2.6.2    Our own experience, and. that of other member states, confirmsthat in practice wo can act to control capital movements when necessary.This has already been-done, under the terms of the Treaties, withoutany special agreement.Details206.3    Articlo 104 of tho e.c. Treaty provides for member states to pursue the economic policy necessary to safeguard their balance-ofpayments while taking care to ensure a high level of employment.Provision is made in Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty for member states to take special measures on account of balance of payments difficulties.Article 109 permits member states faced with sudden crises in their balanceof payments to take the necessary protective measures themselves.   Articlo 108provides more generally for action to deal with balance of payments difficulties.2.6.4    These are flexible provisions, and the question Y/hich theGovernment had to consider was whether they operated satisfactorily inpractice.2.6.5    In his Budget of March 1974, the Chancellor of tho Exchequer tookaction to protect the balance of payments by withdrawing an earlierrelaxation of tho controls over direct outward investment in otherCommunity countries; and, in December 1974, Parliament was informed thattho balance of payments safeguards of the Treaty of Accession wore beinginvoked so that existing exchange controls could continue in full forcebeyond the-end of 1974, when under tho Treaty direct outward investment in other Community countries was due to bo liberalised.   The Commissionand the other-member states were duly informed under tho relevant provisionsof tho Treaty.
2.696    Derogations in respect of capital movements have boon allowedon similar grounds for individual neriber states on a nuribor.ofoccaeions.2,6.7    It is clear that action to control capital movements in ordorto protect tho balance of payments can ho taken whon necessary and thatthere is no question of the Connunity attempting to inpose rules whichwould force this country to ronove controls ovor capital movements when this would dana.ge our balance of payments or employment policies.   the renegotiation objective can bo secured undor the existing terns of the eec Treaty without any special agreement,;.
2.7   THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:    TRADE AND AIDRon ef ?ot i at i on Ob j e ct iye2.7.1   The February Manifesto said:   &quot;The economic interests of the commonwealth and the developing countries must be better safeguarded.   This involves securingcontinued access to the British market and, more generally, the adoption by an enlarged Community of trade and aid policies designed to benefit not just&quot;associated overseas territories&quot; in Africa, but developing countries throughoutthe world&quot;.Outcome2*7.2.   Substantial changes have been secured in Community policies on anumber of fronts.a. Continued access on fair terms has been secured for sugar from the developing countries of the Caribbean and elsewhere and improvements havebeen obtained in the arrangements for dairy products from New Zealand.b. Reductions in Community tariffs have been secured on a range of items,of particular interest to Commonwealth countries, in the GATT Article XXIV:6negotiations following the enlargement of the Community;   agreement has alsobeen secured on some important reductions in Community tariffs on foodstuffsimported from the Mediterranean countries with which the Community isnegotiating agreements.   The detailed mandate for the multi1ateral \radenegotiations agreed by the Community in February 1975 provides for the negotiation of further reductions in agricultural tariffs as well as forwide ranging negotiations on agricultural products in general;   for substantial reductions in industrial tariffs;   and for particular attention to be paid tothe needs of the developing countries.c. In relation to the developing countries a major step forward was taken with the signature on 28 February 1975 of the Lome Convention between the enlarged Community and forty-six developing countries including twenty-twoCommonwealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.   Under theConvention the developing countries are guaranteed free entry into theCommunity for their industrial exports, almost completely free entry fortheir agricultural exports and substantial aid.
Access for Imports from Third countries.7.5*     The first of the changes in Community policies listed in paragraph 2.7.2.above concerned ,sug&amp;r.   For over twenty years Commonwealth cane sugar, imported inguaranteed quantities and at guaranteed prices under the Commonwealth sugar agreement, has supplied two-thirds of our total domestic sugar requirements.   when we joined the Community no firm and precise arrangements were negotiated for continuing 5.mports of Commonwealth sugar in the British market:   and the Common-wealth Sugar Agreement was due to expire at the end of 1974.   So it was a majorand urgent aim in the renegotiation - an aim which had to be pursued against the background of an increasingly difficult short-term supply position - to securesatisfactory access into the enlarged Community, at a fair price, for up to1.4 million tons of sugar from the developing Commonwealth countries of the carribbean and elsewhere (including India) - the same quantity as they suppliedunder the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.-   This was achieved in February 1975 aspart of the Lome Convention.   Guaranteed access was offered indefinitely forquantities of sugar up to 1.4 million tons from the developing Commonwealthsuppliers at a price related to the Community&apos;^ beet sugar prices for its domestic producers, which in the past have normally been higher than the cane sugar price.Access has now been guaranteed on this basis for the quantities which theCommonwealth countries concerned have undertaken to supply.   From the stand-point of the Commonwealth countries the new arrangements as a whole are in many respects more favourable than those previously available under the commonwealth sugar Agreement;   and for ourselves as consumers and for our sugar refiningindustry there is now an assurance of continuing supplies of cane sugar at reasonable prices.2.7.6.     Similarly in the case of dairy products imported from Mew Zealand theTreaty of Accession, while it provided for a review in 1975 of arrangementsafter 1977* offered no certainty about quantities or price after that date.Satisfactory improvements (described in paragraph 2,2.20) have now been securedon these points. I2.7*7*     Improved access to Community markets for products imported from third countries has also been secured by means of reductions in Community tariffs.Following the enlargement of the Community in 1971* negotiations were necessary under Article XXIV:6 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in orderto compensate certain of the Community&apos;s trading partners for changes brought
about by the alignment of the new member states to its arrangements and tothe Common Agricultural Policy.   These negotiations, which were wide ranging,complex and difficult, have been successfully concluded and have led to a range of concessions of particular interest to Commonwealth producers includingtariff reductions on Community imports of wood and paper products, cannedpineapple, fresh and canned salmon and coffee, as well as improved access forfrozen beef and Canadian cheddar cheese.   The United Kingdom took a prominentpart within the Community in securing the success of those negotiations,without which the multilateral trade negotiations, now effectively in train,could not have started.2.7.0.   Some useful&apos; reductions in Community tariffs are also in prospect on imports from certain Mediterranean countries.   One of the provisions of the accession Treaty was that we should join, with necessary adjustments, theagreements which the Community had concluded with these countries, including in particular Spain and Israel which are major suppliers to the British foodmarket and provide important and growing markets for our industrial goods.The Government have successfully insisted in these negotiations that our most important food imports from the Mediterranean must be allowed continuingaccess to our market on significantly better terms than are available underthe CommunityTs existing tariff regime.   The Community has now offeredsubstantial reductions in certain of its present tariffs on imports from thecountries concerned - for example on orange juice, canned fruit salad andtomatoes.   An agreement has been initialled with Israel and negotiations with spain and several other countries are in progress.   When the Community^agreements with Israel and Spain are concluded, we will benefit both fromimproved access to certain of their food exports and from preferential access to their markets for our industrial goods,   (Our exports to Israel and Spainfor example in 1974 totalled  479 million.)2.7.9*   Further improvements in access to Community markets should also result from the GATT multilateral trade negotiations formally launched in Tokyo inSeptember 1973.   In February 1975 the Council of Ministers agreed on anegotiating directive which represents a considerable advance on the &quot;globalapproach&quot; adopted by the Community in June 1973,   The Community has now agreedto negotiate a substantial reduction in industrial tariffs.   On agriculture a detailed and comprehensive mandate has been agreed providing in particular
that for the hulk of world agricultural trade not covered by commodity agreements discussions should be entered into between importers and exporterswith a view to agreeing on conditions for orderly marketing.   The mandate also provides for negotiated reductions in tariffs on agricultural products.   Wehave made it clear to tho rest of the Community that some of these tariffs -particularly on canned fruit and canned fish - are higher than we considerdesirable and it will be one of the Government&apos;s objectives in the multilateral trade negotiations to negotiate reductions on a reciprocal basis with ourtrading partners.   In the case of New Zealand lamb we have given notice to other member states that we intend at the earliest appropriate time to seek the elimination or reduction of the Community tariff, at least for imports into theUnited Kingdom.2.7*10.   The mandate also attaches particular importance to dealing with theproblems of the developing countries,2,7.11.   Following the Community^ adoption of a new negotiating mandate the multilateral trade negotiations have got off to an effective start in Geneva.And although the negotiations will inevitably be long and complex the firm commitment to a liberal approach which we have received from the Communityaugurs well for their success.The Developing countries.7.12.   In so far as developing countries are concerned the Government wanted to go further than improved trading arrangements.   At the outset of the renegotiation we made it clear that the Community needed to adopt a betterbalanced and more broadly based approach to its relations with the developingworld.   A major step in this direction is represented by the Lome Conventionsigned on 28 February 1975*   Under this twenty-two developing commonwealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific together with twenty-fourother developing countries have entered into a special relationship with theCommunity,   The agreement has rightly been described as historic and the developing countries concerned have greeted it as a &quot;new model&quot; for relationsbetween the developed and developing worlds.
2.7.13*   The Convention provides for the free entry into the Community market for industrial products and almost completely free entry for agricultural products from the developing countries concerned.   Of the latter sugar is themost important;   the details of those arrangements are set out inparagraph 2.7.5.   Other important new elements in the Convention are -a. The Community has ceased to require the developing countries to offerreciprocal concessions in respect of its exports to them - &quot;reversepreferences&quot;, which were built into its previous arrangements with the&quot;associated&quot; states.   Instead a major step has been talc en towards the pattern of trade relations for which the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment has called.   The new Convention contains no requirement forreciprocity;   it simply ensures that Community exports to the markets of the developing countries concerned will be no worse treated than those of otherdeveloped countries.b. A substantial new aid fund - the European Development Fund - has been set up for the developing countries which are parties to the Lome Convention.Some  &apos;!.r5Q0 million will be provided over the next few years, a three-foldincrease over the Community&apos;s earlier aid arrangements for the &quot;associated&quot;states^   a substantial part of this will be available to the developing commonwealth countries.   The new Fund will assist a major part of the developingworld including nearly all the developing countries of Africa, and represents a significant move towards a more balanced distribution of the Community^ aid programme as a whole.c. A further important innovation is a new scheme which will help to stabilise the commodity export earnings of the developing countries.   It will cover such products as cocoa, coffee, cotton and copra and one mineral, iron ore.   Thescheme is one to which the developing countries attach very great importance.d. The term of &quot;association&quot; which described the Community^ previous relation-ship with certain developing countries under the Yaounde Convention, has been dropped.   The new Convention is known as the ACP/e.c. Convention of Lome.   To someextent this is a symbolic change, but it reflects a new relationship which placesthe member states of the Community and the developing countries concerned on abasis of free and equal co-operation.
207*14*   In parallel with the negotiations leading up to the Lomo Convention,we have pressed the Community to recognise its obligations to otherdeveloping countries including the Commonwealth countries of Asia.,   In thetrade field, the most important element is the CommunityVs Scheme ofGeneralised Preferences t which allows most of the manufactured exports andmany of tho processed agricultural exports of tho developing countries toenter the Community market duty free or at preferential duty rates.   ThisScheme has been unsatisfactory in several important respects.   In the renegotiation we have called for the progressive elimination over several years of its restrictive features and for an extension of its scope,particularly in respect of processed agricultural products.   Major improve-monts have been achieved in both theso areas in 1975, many of which will benefit the independent Asian Commonwealth countries.   The main improvement is a marked reduction - from 51 to 16 - in the list of sensitive products(other than textiles) where there are pre-set limits to preferential accessinto the member states.   Agreement   has also been secured to a significantextension of the coverage of the Scheme in respect of processed agricultural products;   Asian Commonwealth countries stand to gain particularly from theenlargement of tariff quotas for tobacco and plywood, zero United Kingdomduties for jute and coir products from India and Bangladesh, and agreement to include later this year a range of tropical oils of interest to SouthEast Asian developing countries.   Discrimination against Hong Kong in theScheme has been reduced through the extension to her of preferences on non-leather footwear, her major footwear export interest.   And the Community has undertaken to review Hong Kong*s exclusion from preferences on textiles whenthe Scheme for 1976 is considered.2.7.15^   On 3 March 1975 the Community reached agrooment in principle on thelong-term improvement of the Scheme,   In particular it has been agreed thatthe poorest developing countries - including those of the Indian sub-continent -will be kept specially in mind in future improvements&apos;   and that the scheme will be extended after 1930.   This was the first public declaration by any ofthe developed countries of an intention to extend generalised preferencesbeyond that date.
2.7.16.   A start has also been made in securing a. more balanced distributionof Community aid.   The new European Development Fund has already boonmentioned (paragraph 2.7.13.)..   Some of the poorest developing countries,like India and Bangladesh, are unable to call on this Fund.   Tho community is making substantial quantities of food aid available to them;   but they require financial and technical help as well, and in our view their sha.roof the Community^ total aid effort should more adequately reflect theirdevolopment needs0   Wo urged the Community to participate in the united nations Emergency Measures for the developing countries hardest hit by thorise in oil and other commodity prices;    and - in addition to $42 million of extra food aid - it is providing $250 million of financial aid.Additionally, in July 1974 we secured Community agreement for the first time to the principle of providing financial and technical aid for developing countries that were neither &quot;associated&quot; with the Community nore covered bythe offer of a special relationship with it.   We are pressing for earlyimplementation of this commitment, in the context of a planning frameworkwhich has been drawn up, at our request, for the Community1 s development programme as a whole.   The Commission have now made some useful proposalsfor a five year programme of financial and technical aid, starting in 1976,to be concentrated on tho largest and poorest developing countries.   Theseproposals are currently under study by the member states.
2.8   VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT)Renegotiation objective2.0.1.   The February Manifesto said that there should be &quot;no harmonisationof Value Added Tax which would require us to tax necessities&quot;.Outcome2.8.2.   The Government have established that they can resist any proposalsfor such harmonisation which are unacceptable to us.Details2.8.3*   No existing Community rules set the rates of VAT.   The government can prevent the adoption of any proposal which would run counter to theirstipulation that there should be no harmonisation of VAT which would requireus to tax necessities.2.8.4.   Under the &quot;own resources&quot; system the budgetary resources of theCommunity will include sums corresponding to the yield of Value Added Taxcharged at a rate of up to 1 per cent on a uniform base.   Discussion is continuing in the Community on the Commission&apos;s proposals which seek toestablish this uniform base.   The proposals are not concerned with the ratesat which the tax is levied and provide for the continuation of zero-rating.The Government have made it clear that any agreement on harmonisation of the tax base must include a provision for zero-rating.
3.   OTHER ASPECTS OF COMMUNITY development in addition to the changes and assurances which we have been able tosecure in the course of renegotiation, there are several other aspectsof Community development which are relevant to the general issue of membership.   In some of these we have been able to givo a more pragmaticand more realistic shape to the development of Community policies.   in others we stand to receive benefits, initially modest but laterpotentially substantial,3.1   COKMUlgTY FUITDSFor example othe^Community1a European Social Fund, adt up to improveemployment opportunities and to help raise the standard of living of theCommunity, brought a benefit to the United Kingdom in 1973 and 1974 ofouer  20 million annually, largely for industrial retraining to securecontinued employment for workers who had to change their jobs or wishedto take advantage of new employment opportunities.   The European InvestmentBank, set up to facilitate economic expansion, made loans to United Kingdomenterprises of  113 million in the years 1973-74.   The Regional development fund which it was agreed to set up at the end of 1974, should bring theUnited Kingdom up to  60 million net from its operation over the threeyears 1975-77 for whieh it has initially been established.3.2   THE REMOVAL OF BARRIERS TO trade.2,1   Gne of the objectives of the Community as set out in the e.c. treaty is to remove artificial barriers to trade and industry within itsboundaries so as to maximise the advantages for employment and living standards of a single market of 250 million people.   The Community is oneof our largest and fastest growing markets.   Access to this large market should lead to increased specialisation, standardisation, investment in new capacity and longer production runs0   The lack of these are important factors in explaining eur relatively poor economic performance compared with thatof other advanced industrial countries.
3.2.2   The trade of member states with ene another, as a proportion oftheir total trade, has risen from 36 per cent in 1957 to nearly53 per cent in 1973.   Within these totals, the growth of United kingdom trade with the Community, in both directitns, since entry has been substantial.3.2.3   The removal cf barriers to trade means removing not simplytariffs but all the legal, fiscal and other barriers which impede thefree flew of goods within the Community, the free movement of firms andcf industrial investment and the free movement of workers, includingthe self-employed.   It is inevitably a slow and laborious process Tsuttwe examples may be quoted **f areas in which work is going on and inwhich United Kingdom influenoe has been brought to bear; harnonisationof industrial and food standards and the freedom of citizens of member states to exercise their employment or profession anywhere in theCommunity,3.2,if   The Inited Kingdom has worked in the Community for a lessdoctrinaire approach to harmonisation.   The Ccmmiscion and the other member countries now aooept that its true aim should be to fix commonstandards where necessary under which any product may be traded freelywithin the Community without imposing restrictions on national tastesor preferences.   Uc Finn Gundelach, the Commissioner responsible for this work, said on 12 February 1974:&quot;It is not this Commission^ policy to harmonise for harmonisatisn&apos;ssake.,...It is not this Commission^ policy to force on the populations of the Member States a dra&quot;k uniformity which they have not expressed a wish for and which has, moreover, no basis in the Treaties....&quot;Many earlier plans fcr the introduction of compulsory common standardshave now teen scrapped: this is the case, for example, with both bread andbeer.   National variations will continue, and national tastes will continueto be met.
3*2.5   The Government will continue to he vigilant in securing asensible and selective approach towards harmonisation.   They seeadvantage in seeking to establish &quot;optional&quot; standards Which will ensure that a product conforming to them may bo exported freely to anyother member country.   Suoh measures will benefit our exporters and willnot limit the range of choice to consumers.   Common standards are beingformulated in such fields as the labelling and description of goods,common sizes and measures for containers and proprietary drugs.   work is also continuing on directives covering common standards, includingsafety aspects, for many other manufactured and fjood products so as toimprove protection for the consumer, for workers and for the environment.3.2.6   Community policies have often been regarded in the past asresponding primarily to the interests of producers.   But a CommunityConsumer Protection and Information Programme is now to be adopted whichrecognises explicitly the right of consumers to be represented andconsulted during the development of Community policies.3.2.7   Employed persons may already move freely to jobs in other(Sommunity countries, and work is continuing to enable self-employedpeople to do the same.   Employed persons taking up jobs in other member states preserve their entitlement to social security benefits.   Thereare no plans for the harmonisation of the systems or levels of social security benefits in the member countries of the Community.   The EECTreaty places no obligation on member states to alter their levels orPatterns of social security expenditure.5*2,8  Y/ork is also in hand on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications within the Community.   The Gouncil of Ministers agreed inprinciple on 11 February 1975 to two directives providing for the mutualrecognition of Community qualifications for doctors and for their freedomof establishment.  Y/hen these directives come into force 18 monthsafter their formal adoption, all doctors who are citizens of Communityoountries and possess nationally recognised qualifications will be free to practice In other Community countries, subject to the requirement thatthey should possess an adequate knowledge of the local language.
3.3   ENERGY3.3.1   Energy policy is of special interest to-the United Kingdom.   Ofell the gonmunity members, we alone, through the North -Sea reserves,are in sight of self-sufficiency in oil; we have maintained a strongeoal industry and we have natural gas.   Wo have been pioneers In thedevelopment of nuclear power.   No othor member can match these resources and experience.   But the Community1 s industrial strength depends upon its supplies of energy.   The Treaties setting up the other two communities, the Coal and Steel Community founded in 1951 9 and theEuropean Atomic Energy Community founded at the same time as thoEconomic Community in 1957* recognise the key importance attached by theoriginal six member countries at that period to trade in coal and steel products and to the future development of atomic energy for peacefulpurposes.3.3.2   The importance of energy policy for the members of the community is now even greater.   The flommunity as a whole is the greatest singleimporting area for oil, hard hit &quot;by the rapid rise in oil costs since1973, and it has a major role to play in meeting the crisis, both inco-operation with the other main consumers within the InternationalEnergy Agency and in the proposed dialogue between consumers and producers.The problem of oil is a worldwide one affecting producers and consumers,industrialised and developing countries at the same tine.   It is not susceptible of regional or partial solutions.   But within the 0immunitymember states can co-ordinate their positions for wider international discussions.   Tho influence of the Community in such discussions depends upon the ability of its members to agree together on common policies,3.3*3   The Community has also started to establish a common energypolicy.   We welcome this work provided that it is vonductod in arealistio fashion. We should never allow it to develop in ways whichcould threaten our ownership or oontrol over our own natural resources -North Sea oil and gas for example - and the Commission have made it quite clear that this is no part of their purpose.   Our aim is to co-operate in those measures which will help the Community towards its main goal of reducing dependence on imported energy, for example through conservationprogrammes and the research and development of new energy resources.
C O N F1DENTIAL3.4-        POLITICAL CO-OPERATION3.4.1.   The Nine Governments of the e.c. consult together on broad questions offoreign policy under arrangements they have made for European politicalco-operation.   The machinery was set up by the original six member states ofthe Community in 1970.   After our entry negotiations were completed, we began to participate as well in 1972.3.4.2.   The system of political co-operation stems from informal agreementsamong the nine member governments.   It i3 not governed by the e.c. Treaty,nor bound by its legal provisions.   There are regular meetings of the nine Foreign Ministers, a Political Committee manned by senior officials ofthe nine Foreign Ministries, and a structure of sub-committees and working groups which deal with different geographical areas and specificquestions.   In each of the nine capitals the &quot;host&quot; Foreign Ministry keepsthe other member states informed of all its own important meetings withother countries.   In countries outside the Community and in international organisations there is increasingly close co-operation between therepresentatives of the Nine.   The practical arrangements for all this work are the responsibility of the country having the Presidency of the Council  -of Ministers; the United Kingdom&apos;s turn as President will fall in the first half of 1977, if wo remain members of the Community.3.4.3.   The Nine now regularly discuss international events as they &quot;occur,and try to agree on a common line of action.   Some of the subjects on whichthere has been recent consultation were described in the White. Paper&quot;Developments in the European Community; March-October 1974&quot;*.   There has been close co-operation on many questions considered in the United Nations,the problems of the Middle East and in Cyprus, and developments in Portugal,Latin America and in Africa.   The development of a common position at theConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) is an effectiveexample of the results of political co-operation.   For nearly throe years the Nine, meeting together on an almost daily basis, have made a forcefuland constructive contribution to the Conference.   They have in effect becometho main driving force to use the Conference to create safer and morecivilised relations among all of the states of Europe, both East and West.* Comnd 5740:   November 1974, paragraphs 50-51.
3.4.4.   The underlying aim of this consultation is, whore possible, todraw up common positions on matters of foreign policy which arc of importanceto Western Europe.   This cannot be done overnight, and the beginnings are naturally modest.   Bilateral diplomacy by the individual European statescontinues to have the central role, and it is accepted that in the lastanalysis each member state must make its own judgement on matters of foreignpolicy.   Nevertheless, there is a growing wish to use the politicalco-operation machinery to work for common positions.   The member statesclearly feel increasingly that they are more likoly to attain their objectives on international problems if they do so together and in close co-operation with other countries and in particular their friends andallies.   In this connection the Government much welcomes the arrangementsagreed in 1974- for consultation between the United States and the Nine onforeign policy subjects.3.4.5.   Britain is able to obtain the benefits of this European co-operation on international foreign policy problems because it is a member of theCommunity.   Non-members of the Community do not participate.   Norway, forexample, took part with the United Kingdom for a brief period in politicalco-operation after her successful negotiations to join the Community.   but she has not participated since Autumn 1972.\
confidential/. SOVEREIGNTY AND MEMBERSHIP OP THE COMMUNITYOne of the Government&apos;s renegotiation objectives ^Tas con-concerned with the power of the united Kingdom Parliament over regionalindustrial and fiscal policies (section 2.&quot; above),   This chapter^eals with the general issue of soverei^nty0   An analysis ismade of the different aspects of sovereignty which are affectedby membership of the Community.    It emerges that membership of the Community   involves some change in the position of Parlia-ment and in its relationship with the Executive.   The questionwhether this change is acceptable has to be considered againstthe total background of the advantages and disadvantages of Com-munity membership.4.2.   NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY i.2,1.     No country nowadays has unqualified freedom of action.There are restraints even on the supers-powers.   The freedom ofaction of other countries is even more limited by political, mili-tary and economic realities outside their control.Z.2.2.     Countries are increasingly coming together in inter-dependent groupings in order to defend and advance their interests.Since 1945 we have found it necessary to combine with others toorganise our trade relations, our defence, our monetary interestsand economic policies.   We belong, for example, to&apos;the north atlantic Treaty Organisation, the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade, the International Monetary Fund and the organisation for European Co-operation and Development as well as the united nations itself.   Before we joined the Community, we played a leading part in the European Free Trade Association,4.2.3.   Each of these organisations imposes rights and duties onits members which match the purposes of the organisation.   Thepractical effect varies from one organisation to another.    Some -such as the United Nations - impose certain general politicalobligations.   Others govern their members1 actions in greater detail.   The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade lays down
general rules for trade relations between a large number of coun-tries.   The European Free Trade Association has effective rules,policed by the Council of the Association, to ensure fair corn-petition between its members.    These limit the right of member states to maintain or introduce certain forms of aid to public and private enterprises.   Under their .agreements with the Com-munity, the EFTA countries have also accepted obligations not toadopt public aid. policies which distort competition; and underthese agreements they are required to follow the pricing policies of the ECSC.4&apos;3     THE SPECIAL NATURE OF THE COMMUNITY4.3.1.   The Community has certain distinctive features which makeit unique among international groupings.^.3.2.     The Community is more than a free trade area and a customs union.   It brings together a number of neighbouring countries whose economies, cultures, and political development have inter-acted with each other throughout their history, and who now desireto pursue common aims (which are set out in the introductory sectionof the e.c. Treaty).   In pursuit of these aims the Community followscommon policies, for the benefit of all its members, over a wide range of commercial, economic and social matters.A.3.3.   As the Community goes beyond other international groupingsin the extent of its aims and common action, its institutionsare correspondingly more developed and entail a greater pooling of sovereignty than other organisations.   If the verdict of the referendum is, as the Government recommends, in favour of member-ship, then acceptance of the special institutional features ofthe Community is a necessary means to the achievement of effective and worthwhile co-operation and common action.4.3.4-     Four particular aspects of the Community1s distinctiveinstitutional framework have given rise to some misgivings andmisunde rstanding:
a.     The direct applicability of Community lav; in member coun-tries;bo     the power of member Governments;c. the role of the Commission;d. the future development of the Community,(a).     The direct applicability^ ojf;j?oipmunity law in member countries.3.        Because of the wide range of matters regulated on a community basis, directly applicable Community law is an essential part of the Community machinery.   On such matters as tariffs and agricultural prices, the collective agreements of the ninemember Governments sitting in the Coancil need to be implementedby means of common rules applying uniformly throughout the Com-munity and not depending on separate national legislation fortheir application.   The implications of this system of directlyapplicable law for the United Kingdom Parliament are discussed in Section 4s5 below,(b).   Power of Member Governments4,3,6,   It is clear that the power of political decision in the ,,Community rests with the member states.   Decisions on major policyquestions are taken by the Council of Ministers, on which eachof the member states is equally represented.   At each stage in discussions in the Council and its subordinate machinery, efforts are made to accommodate the views of the member states and tonarrow the differences between them.   The final decision is theresponsibility of the Council itself.   The system is flexibleenough to permit significant changes of approach by the community to meet changing circumstances.   Renegotiation has shown clearly the way in which the direction of Community policy can be alteredto take account of the essential requirements of a member state.4.3,7*   The importance of accommodating the interests of individual member states is recognised in the Council&apos;s practice, with certainvery limited exceptions, of taking decisions by consensus, so that each member state is in a position to block agreement unless interests
CONFIDENTIAL,to which it attaches importance are met.   This has been the prac-tice in the Community since the conclusions reached in Luxembourgon 28 January 19&apos;.&apos;6.   It has not been changed by the decision of heads of Government in December 1974 &quot;to renounce the practice which consists of making agreement on all questions conditional on the unanimous consent of the member states&quot;.*   The purpose ofthis decision is to encourage member states to be more flexible,and in particular not to obstruct agreement when the matters a tissue are not of the first importance to them.   It remains theunchallenged right of each member stats to decide   which issuesit does regard, as sufficiently important to require unanimous deci-sion..4.3.8.     The power oflbraber Governments is also exercised at regular meetings of Heads of Government.   The nine Heads ofGovernment at their meeting in Paris in December 1974, decidedto meet in future at least three times a year.     Their meeting in Dublin on 10-11 March 1975 dealt with1 the outstanding issues of renegotiation.(c).     The Role of the Commission^4.3.9.     The Commission^ responsibilities are those which the member states have delegated to it under the Treaties and undersubsequent legislative instruments made by the Council.    The Com-missioners are appointed by the Member Governments.   The Commission&apos;general duties are set out in Article 1 of the e.c. Treaty.4.3.10.   One of the Commission&apos;s responsibilities is to act asguardian of the Treaties and to supeirvise the enforcement of Com-munity obligations subject to the rulings of the European Courtof Justice.   Permanent institutional machinery for ensuring thatthe Treaties are observed is clearly in the interests of all the signatories.   An example of this aspect of the Commissionsfunctions is its powers over state aids under the fair competitionprovisions of the e.c. Treaty:    this is discussed in&quot;paragraphs.5.1-2.5.13 above in relation to one of the Governments rene-gotiation objectives.* Text of the Communique issued by the Heads of Government of the nine States of the European Community at their meeting in Paris on9 and 10 December 197&apos;! (cmnd 5830s   December 1974) p. 4.
/U3.11o     The Commission also issues in its own right some regu-lations which have the force of law.   This ability to create whatis technically a form of legislation is considered in the community to be essential to effective day-to-clay management in such fieldsas the operation of the CAP and the Customs Union.   But its scopeis relatively limited.   The Commission can issue regulations orinstruments only in the fields in which such powers have been expressly delegated to it, either by the Treaties or by legislativeact of the Council.   In practice Commission instruments are largelyconcerned with the detailed implementation of Council legislation.There can he no extension of the areas in which it is competent to act, except by decision of the Council.   The effective substance of control therefore restf with the Government of the member states.--5.3.12.   The Commission also has the role of putting forward ideas and making formal proposals to the Council.   It normally con-suits extensively with-member states and, as appropriate, withtrades unions, representatives of industry and other specially interested or qualified groups before putting forward suggestionsor proposals.   The ideas it puts forward often   form the basisof now decisions by the rember states.   The agreement reached byHeads of Government in Dublin on 10-11 March on a correctivemechanism to deal with potential unfairness to the United kingdom in the &quot;own resources&quot; system (see paragraphs 2.3.1.-2.3.13 above)was for example based on detailed suggestions which the Commissionput forward at the invitation of the Heads of Government at their meeting in December 1974.(d).     Future. Development of the CommunityA&apos;3.13   At the October 1972 Summit Conference the previous conservative government endorsed the target date of I98O for the achievement of &quot;the major objectives of transforming .... the whole complex ofthe relations of Member States into a Eurojpean JJnion1&apos;.   But theGovernment have established that there is no agreement in theCommunity on what European Union means beyond a general aspirationto closer co-operation.   They welcome the new and more realisticapproach adopted by Heads of Government in December 1974 when
M Tinderaans, Prime Minister of Belgium, was invited to prepare areport on the subject by the end of 1975-   This should enablemember Governments to define what their purpose is.   The Govern-ment&apos;s view, which is shared by a number of other member states,is that closer co-operation is desirable and must be pursued ina pragmatic way, but that there is no wide support elsewhere intho Community for moves towards a centralised federal state.4.3.14.   The Heads of Government of the Community countries, at their meeting in December 1974t expressed themselves in favour of theintroduction of direct elections to the European Assembly by universalsuffrage.*   It was however made absolutely clear by the United kingdom that &quot;Her Majesty^ Government could not themselves take up aposition on the proposal boforo the process of renegotiation hadbeen completed, and tho results of renegotiation submitted to the british people.&quot;   If British membership is confirmed, any schemefor direct elections to the European assembly or any revision ofthe powers of tho Assembly would require the specific approval oftho United Kingdom Parliament.4.3.15-    Tho Government do not accept any commitment to any sort offoderal structure in Europe.   Wo member Government has askod us forany such commitment in the course of renegotiation.   All member states agree that future institutional developments must conform to political decisions of the Governments and Parliaments of member states.The British Parliament will discuss any potential now development in good time,4.4.   THE ROLE OF PARLIAI1EKT4.4.1. Tho foregoing paragraphs of this Chapter provide the necessarybackground to consideration of the effect of membership of the Com-munity on tho position of Parliament,   In particular paragraph 4.3.5.above pointed out that one of the distinctive and fundamental features of tho Community was tho system of directly applicable Community law.This system of Community law, which provides an effective moans of implementing and enforcing tho collective agreements of Governments inthe Council, has immediate effect as law within the member statesand is held to prevail over any conflicting national legislation.* Cmnd 5830, December 1974: Page 4.
4.4.2.   Membership of the Community therefore raises for us the problemof reconciling this system of directly applicable law made by theCommunity with our tradition that Parliament is the sovereign legislatorand can make or unmake any law whatsoever.   The situation was fullyanalysed in the White Paper published by the Labour Government in May 1967*-*&apos;[lf this country became a member of the European Communities,]it would be necessary to pass legislation giving the force of law to those provisions of the Treaties and Community instruments whichare intended to take direct internal effect within the Member States.This legislation would be needed, because, under our consitutionallaw, adherence to a treaty does not of itself have the effect of changing our internal law even where provisions of the Treaty are intended to have direct internal effect as law within the participatingStates.   The legislation would have to cover both provisions inforce when we joined and those coming into force subsequently asa result of instruments issued by the Community institutions.   no new problem would be created by the provisions which were in force at the time we became a member of the Communities.   The constitutionalinnovation would lie in the acceptance in advance as part of the law of the United Kingdom of provisions to be made in the future byinstruments issued by the Community institutions - a situation forwhich there is no precedent in this country   However, theseinstruments, like ordinary delegated legislation, would derive their force under the law of the United Kingdom from the originalenactment passed by Parliament .....It would also follow that within the fields occupied by the Communitylaw Parliament would have to refrain from passing fresh legislationinconsistent with that law as for the time being in force.&quot;* Legal and Constitutional Implications of United Kingdom Membership of theEuropean Communities, (Cmnd 3301: May 1967) paragraph 22 and paragraph 23.
4,4,3.   The problem therefore has to be considered from two aspects: first the general issue of whether the ultimate sovereignty of Parliament hasbeen weakened, and secondly whether Parliament can play an effective role in the making of any particular new Community law.   On the general issue,Parliament by the European Communities Act 1972 authorised the application in this country of directly applicable Community law and to that extent hasdelegated its poxiiers.   Parliament has however the undoubted power to repealthat Act, on which our ability to fulfil our Treaty obligations stilldepends.   Thus our membership of the Community in the future depends on the continuing assent of Parliament.4.4.4..   At the level of the day-to-day legislative activity of the Communitythere is a range of legislative instruments, from the purely technical andregulatory to items of major policy significnace.   Apart from the instrumentsmade by the Commission in specific areas (see paragraph 4*3-11 above), the major items of Community haw are contained in instruments adopted by theCouncil, in whose discussions and decisions United Kingdom Ministersnecessarily take part.   Parliament, by passing the 1972 Act, in effectremitted to the Government responsibility for safeguarding United kingdom interests in the Council deliberations which result in directly applicableCommunity law.   United Kingdom Ministers remain directly answerable toParliament, since the continuance of any Government depends on Parliament&apos;ssupport.   Parliament thus operates in the Community law-making process byexercising its traditional role of controlling and restraining theGovernment against the background of the ultimate sanction of withdrawalof confidence.   This applies to Ministers when they are sitting in theCouncil in Brussels as much as when they are talcing decisions solely as members of the Government of the United Kingdom.4.4^5-   For Parliament to exercise this control and restraint it is ofcourse essential that it should have sufficient information and theopportunity to make its views known to Ministers.   The Government has been concerned since it took office in 1974 to ensure that these requirements are met. ji4*4*6-.   Following the recommendations of Select Committees of both houses of Parliament, and on the initiative of the Government, Scrutiny committees were set up with the status of Select Committees in both Houses in april and May 1974.   The Scrutiny Committees have the task of examining all
Commission proposals for Council legislation and other documents published by the Commission for submission to the Council, and of reporting inparticular on those which should be debated in Parliament because of thepolitical or legal issues which they raise.   The Government have undertaken to supply the Committees with the information which they need and to find time for debates which they recommend.   They have further undertaken toensure, consistently with the national interest,   that final decisions arenot taken in the Council of Ministers on proposals recommended for debate in Parliament until the debate has taken place.4.4.7.   Over the whole range of Council instruments the Community&apos;s practiceis to publish proposals so that they are available for public examination and discussion some time before they come up for discussion in the Councilof Ministers.   In many cases therefore Parliament is able to consider proposals at a much earlier stage in the policy-making process than if theproposals were for United Kingdom subordinate legislation.   Moreover, the supervision exercised by Parliament extends over a wider range of subjects,in greater detail, because the Community practice is to include in legalinstruments decisions which we might take administratively.4.4-8&apos;   Prom the date of their being set up to [21 March 1975] &quot;the Houseof Commons Scrutiny Committee considered and reported on [36$] Communitydocuments and the House of Lords Committee on [397] documents.   Of these the Commons Committee identified [58] documents as raising issues of sufficient importance to warrant their being debated by the House, and the lords Committee similarly identified [2l] documents.   Up to the same date[35] of these documents were debated in the Commons and [ll] in the Lords;the remainder will be debated in due course..   In these debates Members haveexpressed their views on Community proposals.   On a number of occasionsthe debates in the House of Commons have led to resolutions committing theGovernment to a particular course of action in subsequent negotiations inthe Council of Ministers.
4.4*9*   The Government intend to continue to develop these arrangementsso as to enable Parliament to express its view on the right issues in theright form at the right time.   The House of Commons Select Committee on procedure has been asked to consider the despatch of business relating to european secondary legislation, which brings additional pressure to analready crowded Parliamentary timetable.   The Government propose toimprove the arrangements in the light of the Procedure Committee*s report which is expected shortly.1
5.   WIDER CONSIDERATIONS5.1   The issue of Community membership is of fundamental importance for britain&apos;s place and role in the world.   In his Parliamentary statement on 2 May (see paragraph 1.3) the Prime Minister said -&quot;We do not see European unity as something narrow or inward-looking.Britain has her own vital links through the Commonwealth, and inother ways, with other continents.   So have other European countries.Together we can ensure that Europe plays in world affairs the part whichthe Europe of today is not at present playing.   For a Europe thatfails to put forward its full economic strength will never have thepolitical influence which I believe it could and should exert withinthe United Nations, within the Western Alliance, and as a means for effecting a lasting detente between East and Westj and equallycontributing in ever fuller measure to the solution of the world&apos;sNorth-South problem, to the needs of the developing world.&quot;5o2   This remains the Government&apos;s approach.   The last year has shown thatEuropean policies towards the outside world can be decisively modified to take account of our views.5.3   A coherent Europe is an essential pillar of the Atlantic partnership,and a more co-operative relationship has now been established between the nine and the United States.   There is now a more liberal Communityattitude towards the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations.. Amore even-handed policy is being developed towards all the countries of the developing world&quot;,   this will help to avoid confrontation- between them and lthe developed countries, particularly on commodity matters and rawmaterials.   CorcflSonwealth Governments have^had&amp; clear theSi? view that-theywrsh Britain to remain&apos;in- the Community.   &apos;   -     :
5.4.   The member states of the Community have closely related andinterdependent economies and what any of them decides in the field ofeconomic policy can affect other member states.   Last year we were able,as a member of the Community, to argue the need for reflationary action bymember states with substantial balance of payments surpluses,.   economic co-operation between member governments within the Community takes placein an interdependent world in whioh the role of regional groupings has grown steadily in recent years.   Increasingly the Wine Governments aretaking common positions in international trade and monetary discussions.Other countries look to the Community for a European view.   The United kingdom is more dependent on international trade than most countries and theGovernment have been able to ensure that positions taken by the Community,which are of great importance for our trading and financial interests,reflect United Kingdom views.5.5 In the Governments view the consequences of BritainS withdrawal from the Community would be adverse - and uncertain. This uncertaintycould be protracted and would itself be damaging.5.6   There could be a significant effect on confidence, affecting bothinvestment- in the United Kingdom and our ability to finance our balanceof payments deficit.   There would be a risk of a deterioration, for a time at least, both in the level of employment and in the rate of inflation.5.7   We would have to engage in the negotiation of a new tradingrelationship with the Community and with the rest of the world; this wouldbe bound to be difficult.   If we were unable to secure special tradingarrangements with the Community, our exports would face a high Communitytariff on such products as chemicals, commercial vehicles and textiles.Even if an acceptable free trade arrangement could be negotiated, thiswould be accompanied by conditions which would be likely to limit theGovernments, freedom to give assistance to British industry.
5.8   We would no longer participate in the Communities institutions, orin the political co-operation machinery.   The Community and its member states would still be our closest neighbour and.our largest market, and community policies would remain of direct concern to us.   But there wouldbe the difficulties of pursuing our interests, and of applying our influence, from outside rather than inside the Community.   Our withdrawal would limit the potential benefits of interdependence.   It would be. a seriousset-back to the development of closer and more co-operative relationswithin the Community, and between the Community and the wider world.   Itwould threaten the political cohesion of Western Europe.5.9   The Government have always believed that, provided the terms of membership were right and fair, it is in the interests of Britain andof Europe that we should be a member of the Community.   The wider considerations set out in this Chapter confirm the Government&apos;s judgementthat membership of the Community is in Britain&apos;s interest on the basis ofthe renegotiated terms.5.10   Through membership of the Community we are better able to advance and protect those national interests which are the essence of sovereignty.We are only at the start of our relationship with the Community: we cannow begin to play a full part in its construction and development.   TheCommunity has shown that it is a flexible organisation, which is ready to adapt to the changing circumstances of the world and to respond to the differing needs of member states.5*11   As the Prime Minister summed up in his Parliamentary statement on18 March.&quot;A fundamental change not in the treaty, but in the practice,has been brought about by the new system of Heads of Governmentsummits started with that convened by President Giscard d&apos;Estaingin Paris last September and continued by the December meeting and now the Dublin meeting.&quot;This system has already de facto reasserted a degree of politicalpower at the top level, not only for the month by month decisions,but over the general method of operation of the Market.   This doesnot mean it has become a Europe des patries.     It is a Community.&quot;
THE DECISION5.12   The decision is now for the British people.   The Government will accept their verdict.   If the people so decide, we shall confirm our place inEurope and work together to build a better Britain, a better europe and a better world.
