IMS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government a 9C(75) 27 COPY NO       0 &amp;10 March 1975CABINETPHASING OUT PRIVATE PRACTICE FROM THE national health service memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. We are committed by the Manifesto to &quot;phase out private pay bedsfrom National Health Service hospitals&quot;.    It had been my hope that a programme of phasing out could be achieved in a calm atmosphere and byagreement with the medical profession and other staff in the National health service (NHS).    But events have proved otherwise.    Since June and July1974 when some non-medical staff at Charing Cross and other hospitals firstrefused to service private patients sporadic industrial action against private patients has continued and, in the continued absence of agreement with themedical profession on a programme of phasing out over a reasonable period the introduction of common waiting lists from 1 January 1975 and a reductionin underutilised pay beds it is likely to escalate.    Proposals were put tothe medical profession in the Minister of State&apos;s Working Party in Octoberbut no agreement had been reached when the Working Party ceased.Further discussion of these proposals with the profession however desirableis not likely to be practicable so long as consultants are taking industrial action.    The consultants&apos; actions have also exacerbated the feelings of staffwithin the NHS over the continued existence of pay beds.2. Sporadic but nonetheless highly damaging action by members of theNational Union of Public Employees (NUPE) and other trade unions withinthe hospital service has already led to the enforced closure of some paybeds.   Responsible trade union leaders whom I have met now tell me that unless a firm statement of the Government timetable to honour its Manifestocommitments on phasing out is made soon they cannot continue to hold backtheir members.    We will then be faced with a situation of anarchy whereindustrial action against pay beds will be greatly intensified and relationsbetween medical, ancillary and nursing staffs embittered in consequence.The Government will be powerless to prevent action and will be attacked onall sides,   I am advised by the trade union leaders that with the promise oflegislation they can hold the situation for 18 months.   In addition some of theprivate medical schemes (eg the British United Provident Association) are quite legitimately laying plans for expansion and health authorities, and someof the members of health authorities who support our views, are pressing me1
for guidance on the observations they should make if they are asked by localauthorities to comment on planning applications for new premises for theprivate sector.    In view of all these considerations I believe it is essential in the long term interests of the National Health Service and of patients thatthe Government should now establish and make an early announcement of a firm programme for phasing out and for exercising some degree of supervision over any consequential developments in the private sector.As such supervisory powers could affect the conditions in which the private sector operates, some announcement of our intention to activate existing powers more fully is essential if we are not to be accused of bad faith.    the timing of any statement, however, is inevitably complicated, or. the on,ehand by the effect that it might have on the progress of negotiations on the consultants&apos; contract and the resolution of the present industrial action by many senior hospital doctors, and on the other by the need to demonstrateto the trade unions and the Trades Union Congress that the government intends to take positive steps to implement its Manifesto commitment tophase out pay beds from the National Health Service.    I am satisfied thata Government statement of intent cannot long be delayed and I am anxiousto secure my colleagues agreement to my making one on the lines indicatedin Annex 1 when I judge the time to be right,3. The Law Officers have advised (in an Opinion dated September 1974)that it would be prudent to legislate on phasing out since, in their opinion,the existing power to authorise the use of pay beds must be exercised, asin practice it has been, after consideration of the position in individualhospitals;  and that it is likely that the courts would hold that to withdrawall gristing authorisations, not by reference to local conditions but pursuant to a general policy to bring an end to private practice in the NHS, would notbe within the intention of the Act.4. To avoid the possibility of litigation which is raised by the LawOfficers&apos; Opinion (see paragraph 3) I therefore seek axithority for theimmediate preparation of a short Bill which would abolish all pay beds from1 November 1976.    This would be two years after I first announced our intentions in The Queen&apos;s Speech Debate.    I would propose to discuss withthe Lord President when this Bill might be introduced.5. When Cabinet discussed consultants contracts they concluded that&quot;in terms of public expenditure the phasing out of pay beds should be leftaside for the time being, as the timing of that measure would need to beconsidered by the Cabinet in the light of the progress on the new contracts&quot;.(CC(74) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 4).    I accepted at that time that becauseof the constraints on public expenditure, pay beds might have to be phasedout over a longer period than would otherwise be desirable, so that the costof using pay beds for NHS patients would only be felt gradually.    It was thought that this would amount ultimately to  20 million (at 1974 survey prices) - the equivalent of the present revenue from pay beds.    Since thenas a result of continuing industrial action against pay beds and the likelihood that such action will increase, the use of pay beds by private patients is2
falling, and is likely to fall still further in the coming months.    As Iindicated in my earlier memorandum (C(74) 143) I could not absorb theadditional cost by reducing the provision made for other parts of the NHS.In a situation in which because of militant action by ancillary and nursingstaff it is no longer practicable to contemplate a carefully phasedprogramme of phasing out spread over several years, the additional costof using pay beds for NHS patients will need to be made good by anincrease in my programme to be met from the contingency reserve.6. A background note on pay beds and private practice is at Annex 2.7. There are a number of issues on which I would have to take actionfollowing phasing out.    These issues - supervision of the private sector,the treatment of overseas patients, and the use of NHS supportingfacilities - are discussed in Annex 3.8. In the interim period before phasing-out is completed I would propose to embark upon an exercise to reduce the authorisation of under-utilised pay bods (a similar and successful exercise was conducted in 1967)and to take steps to comabt &quot;queue-jumping&quot; by private patients.CONCLUSION9o I invite my colleagues -i. to authorise the preparation of legislation as set out inparagraph 4 above;ii, to agree that I should make a statement in the House on thelines indicated in Annex 1.B A department of Health and Social Security10 March 19753
ANNEX 1DRAFT STATEMENT ON PAY BEDSWith permission Mr Speaker I wish to make a statement to the Houseahout the phasing out of private medicine from within National health service hospitals.    The House will be aware that I stated on1 November 1974 in the queen s Speech that the Government intended tocarry out   its commitment to phase out private pay &quot;beds from national health Service hospitals.    This is a policy to ensure that the skillsand resources of the MS are allocated and used on the basis of medicalneed alone.    It is a policy designed to end the unfairness of queue-jumping within NHS hospitals.This policy affects all those who work in the NHS but the staff of the nhs are themselves divided over the issue.    Most of the trade unionswho represent NHS staff support this policy.    The British medical association however do not as they made clear in discussions on theJoint Working Party with the medical profession, which was chaired by my honourable Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport.    The Govern-ment has now decided to introduce a Short Bill before the end of this session to abolish all pay beds within NHS hospitals by a set date.-i v: . UK:.:.; .L.;.!.;.K :^i-r.s !.:.:a.u v-      v.-,t.    uoy  v.v t ,:. ..-,;:*v - fi&apos;As Secretary of State I have a general responsibility for public healthwhich includes aspects of the care given in the private sector as wellas that in the NHS.     In the short term my existing powers are justadequate to discharge my responsibilities to all patients whether privateor not and to the NHS itself, but it is clear that control over standardsmay need to be exercised more extensively than they  have been to-date.In the longer term, should developments in the private sector suggestthat it would grow much beyond its present size, to the detriment ofthe NES, then the Government would need to consider asking parliament for additional powers to regulate such growth.Concern has been expressed to me that our phasing out policy might under-mine Britain&apos;s reputation as an international centre for specialisedmedical treatment.    Many of the overseas patients coming into Britain,especially for medical treatment, already go to the wholly private sectoroutside the National Health Service.   But some wanting specialised1
services involving new techniques go to MS hospitals, particularly to specialist academic units in our teaching hospitals.   I can see noobjection to MS hospitals continuing to treat such foreigners needingspecialised skills provided there is no &quot;queue-jumping&quot; by them, thatthey are admitted as MS and not private patients and that any fees theypay go to the hospital and not to the consultant.     I already have powerto charge aliens who receive treatment as MS patients and I would intend to review the level of charges to take account of the new situation.   Theprivate sector at present relies heavily on the MS for certain facilities,including blood, radiography and laboratory testing.     I am reviewingwhat facilities, if any, should continue to be made available to theprivate sector and for which I would ensure that realistic charges aremade.   In the main, I believe that separation should be as complete aspossible.   I would not however propose to make any charge for blood, otherthan the costs of services such as cross-matching.One reason, I know, why individuals sometimes &quot;go private&quot; is becausethey wish for greater privacy than they think is available in the MS,In fact, Aneurin Bevan himself established a system of &quot;amenity beds&quot;under which, for a small fee (now up to  2 a day), a patient receivingMS treatment could be accommodated in a single or small ward.   I have every intention of maintaining this system, and indeed of building on it.     To date, this &quot;amenity bed&quot; facility has not been well used, partly,at least, because it has been given so little publicity;   and we are now considering ways as to how we might re6tify this.    As will be apparentfrom our designs for new hospitals, the Government is committed firmlyto providing every patient with the maximum privacy possible.At present, on average only 52 per cent of pay beds in MS hospitals inEngland are occupied by paying patients at any one time compared with81 per cent for MS beds.     There is also continuing concern about thefact that some patients are admitted to pay beds with less delay thanMS patients with similar medical conditions.     Separately from theprogramme of phasing out I am therefore proposing to reduce theauthorisations of pay beds in areas where these are under-utilised.   i will also approach the medical profession again to see if they could agree to introduce common waiting list procedures for both paying and non-paying patients.    Provided these steps can be taken soon I would intend to abolish all pay beds and most other private facilities within MS
hospitals by 1 November 1976.    This would be two years after I firstannounced the policy in the Debate on the Queen&apos;s Speech.Within this broad framework I am anxious fully to consult with themedical profession and the other staff of the MS about the mostsensible way of carrying out this programme, including the target date to be incorporated in the Bill.3
CC*NRDE&apos;NT.&amp;LANNEX pay BEDS AND PRIVATE PRACTICEThere are 4*500 pay beds in 720 NHS hospitals in England.   All but a few ofthem are in acute, non-psychiatric hospitals and form two per cent of all beds in those hospitals.   Legally, any part-time doctor on the staff of a NHShospital by arrangement with the AHA may treat a patient privately in one ofthese authorised pay beds.   Whole-time doctors are prohibited by their contractfrom engaging in private practice.2. About 6,000 general medical practitioners (family doctors) work part-time as hospital medical staff. Apart from these, NHS hospitals have 19,000 whole-time medical staff, including 5*900 consultants, 1,500 honorary staff including,000 consultants and 6,000 part-time including 5*400 consultants many of whom have &quot;maximum part-time&quot; contracts, ie are required by their contracts to give&quot;substantially the whole of their time&quot; to the NHS. The total &quot;whole-timeequivalent&quot; of consultants is 9*000.Charges5.    Under existing legislation the charges for each &quot;class&quot; of hospitals(there are five including teaching, non-teaching and psychiatric) have to bedetermined by the Secretary of State for a period of 12 months beginning on1 April in any year and have to have regard to the total estimated cost of treating in-patients in hospitals of that class during the period.   In additionthey include such contribution to capital expenditure as the Secretary of Stateconsiders reasonable.4.    All but a few private patients pay fees to their private doctor and paythe hospital a charge from which the coBt of consultant services has been excluded.   A higher charge is in any case made to patients treated in a singleroom instead of other accommodation.   The current weekly charge for patients in a single room treated by a private doctor is  172.90 in a London teachinghospital and  123.90 in a non-teaching acute hospital.Aliens etc5.    Among patients treated in authorised pay beds are some not ordinarily resident in this country and consequently not entitled to NHS treatment.   Theactual number or proportion of aliens among private patients nationally at
any one time is not known but in some hospitals of high international reputethe proportion in a single specialty has at times reached 20-35 per cent.Because the number of pay beds in each hospital is strictly limited a fewwell-known consultants and hospitals are said to have longer waiting listsfor private than for NHS patients.Government proposals to the professions6.     The Government is committed by its manifestos for the February and october elections in 1974 to a programme of phasing out pay beds from NHShospitals.   In March 1974 the Secretary of State announced the setting upof a joint working party with the medical and dental professions to considerthe contracts of senior hospital medical and dental staff and the arrangementsfor private practice.   The following Government proposals were put forward inNovember 1974 for discussion in the Private Practice Panel of the joint working party (and were published the same month):a. that all in-patient admissions should in future be made on thebasis of parity between the NHS and the private sector, so thatany delays in admission will apply equally in both sectors;b. that a review of pay beds should be undertaken and authorisationsreduced where beds are not very intensively used;c. that phasing out should commence thereafter, further measuresstarting on an agreed date in 1975 and continuing over areasonable period.The proposals also covered the cessation of the use for private patients ofNHS facilities in hospital X-ray and pathological departments.7.     The Panel had not begun to discuss the implementation of these proposalswhen the joint working party ceased to function as a result of the consultants&apos;action.
Annex 3There are a number of issues on which action would be requiredfollowing phasing out:(a) SupervisionWith phasing out,   the private sector outside the National health service would take on a new role.    I have a general and continuingpublic health responsibility for the standard and quality of servicesgiven privately.    In addition I am anxious that the private sectorshould not operate in such a way as to damage the National health service by for instance the diversion of scarce manpower resources,aggressive and unrestrictive advertising which &quot;knocks&quot; the NHS orthe excessive use of certain NHS testing facilities.    I am thereforeurgently considering what supervision will be needed over the private sector.    My powers of supervision over standards of health are probably adequate.   Bearing in mind, however, the strong opposition of certain sections of the Labour Party (some local authorities are alleged to be refusing planning permission for the development ofprivate nursing homes primarily on political grounds) and the TradeUnion Congress to uncontrolled development of private medicalfacilities, I cannot rule out the possibility that in the long termit may be necessary for me to seek additional powers enabling meto regulate the overall size of the private sector,  to controladvertising or to reg&quot;late the use of trained staff.    It is too soon to make specific provision for this especially as the needfor such additional powers could well be affected by the extentto which the private sector continues to benefit from various taxadvantages  (eg BUPA group subscriptions,  tax exemption of benefitsreceived by BUPA subscribers) on which I have already approached the Chancellor in correspondence.(b) Treatment of overseas patientsConcern has been expressed to me that our phasing out policy might undermine Britain&apos;s reputation as an international centre for specialised medical treatment.   Many of the overseas patientscoming into Britain especially for medical treatment already goto the wholly private sector outside the National Health Service.But some wanting specialised services involving new techniques1
go to NHS hospitals,  particularly to specialist academic units in our teaching hospitals.    I can see no objection to NHS hospitals!continuing to treat such foreigners needing specialised skillsprovided there is no &quot;queue jumping&quot; by them,  that they are admitteilas paying patients of the NHS and not as private patients of theconsultant so that any fees they pay accrue to the NHS and not the Iconsultant.    I already have power to charge aliens who receivetreatment as NHS patients and I would intend to review the levelof charges to take account of the new situation,  so as to increase Ithe revenue from this source.(c)    Supporting facilities the private sector at present relies heavily on the NHS forcertain facilities including blood,  radiography,  and laboratorytesting.    I am reviewing what facilities if any should continueto be made available to the private sector,  and for which I would    1ensure that realistic charges are ma-de; in the main I believe that 1separation should be as complete as possible.    I would not howeverpropose to make any charge for blood, other than the costs of services such as cross-matching.
