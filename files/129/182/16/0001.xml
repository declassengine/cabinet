By direction of the Prime Minister I am circulating herewith acopy of the proposed guidelines which were handed round at the meetingof the Cabinet this morning.2. These will be discussed at the meeting of the Cabinet on 20 March,In the meantime the Prime Minister has asked that members of theGovernment should conform to them.JOHN hunt cabinet Office18 March 1975
GUIDANCE ON PROCEDURE BETWEEN ANNOUNCEMENT OFGOVERNMENT RECOMMENDATION AND REFERENDUM ,&apos;aNote by the Prime minister the Government has now made its recommendation on theresults of the renegotiation of our terms of membership of theEuropean Community.      The Cabinet could not however reach unanimous agreement on this and, given the unique circumstances of a referendum on this long-standing issue which cuts across Party lines,has agreed that those Ministers - whether members of the Cabinet ornot - who do not agree with the Government&apos;s recommendation should be free to advocate a different view during the referendum campaign.?,,      This derogation from the normal principle of collective responsibility is only justified by the unique circumstances ofthe, referendum,  and it is essential that all Ministers - whethersupporting the Government recommendation or not - should avoidpersonalising,  trivialising, or sensationalising the argument, in away which could, all too easily impair the current unity of theGovernment en other matters, and leave lasting scars.      A situationwhere members of the Government are publicly ranged on differentsides of the public debate will impose great strains upon loyaltyamong colleagues,  and we must all do everything in our power toensure that those strains are kept within the bounds of toleranceand do not damage the Government&apos;s basic cohesion.      We shallsucceed in this only if all Ministers make their contributions tothe debate strictly in terms of issues, without seeking to identifyparticular arguments or issues with particular colleagues.  In particular(1)   No Minister should make any speech or statement as an answer to or an atttack upon a speech by. another Minister,and there should be no private or unattributabje briefingwhich criticises or comments directly on something whichhas been said by another Minister.
(2)    No Minister should allow himself to beput into a situation in which he appears&apos; in direct confrontation, on the sameplatform or programme, with another minister or Government backbencherwho takes a different view on this issue.(3)   No Minister should appear on a platform orprogramme in association with or support ofa Member of Parliament, of a&apos;different political party,  or with a representative of any organisation he would not in other circumstancebe seen dead with.    Each Minister has the personal responsibility of ensuring that anyone appearing on bis platform is acceptable.(4)   No Minister should accept an invitation to speak on this issue in a constituencyrepresented by a Labour Member of Parliamentwithout the express prior agreement of that member.3. t There are certain other matters arising from &quot;anagreement to differ&quot; on which I should give guidance tomy colleagues.
4.      The purpose of the &quot;agreement to differ&quot; is to enable ministers who differ from the Government&apos;s recommendation to be free to speak openly against it in the referendum campaign inthe country.      In the light of this,  and given the need to preserve the cohesion of the Government,  I do not think it would be right for a regiment of Ministers who differ to express views contraryto the Government&apos;s recommendation in the debates that take placein Parliament on the Government&apos; s recommendation,, &apos;    And of courseMinisters should not speak against the Government recommendation invisits abroad.   , We need to establish a regime for parlimentary debates - and Party meetings - and this must cover non-cabinet ministers.5.      This situation also raises important issues in regard to the responsibilities of Ministers who differ from the Government&apos;recommendation for work in their Departments on European matters.This will arise mainly in connection with attendance at Councilmeetings in Brussels or sending instructions for meetings whichwill be attended by officials,  in answering Parliamentary questions and in dealing with the work of,  and debates arising from reports othe Scrutiny Committee.      So long as the Government1s posture was oof - renegotiation for success on the basis of our Manifesto, all ministers were able to take responsibility for the European work of&quot;their Departments, &apos; no matter how sceptical they might have been ofthe eventual results,      It would however,  be a different matter for ministers who are openly campaigning against our continued membership of the European Community to be personally responsibleeither for ongoing Community business or for defending an aspect ofthe Government1s policy with which they disagree.6.      I have decided therefore that,  to avoid both damage to our external relations and personal embarrassment to Ministers, wemust make a temporary change in the normal arrangements, and that ministers who dissent from the Government&apos;s recommendation shouldnot themselves handle ongoing -Community business during the periodof the referendum campaign either in Brussels or in Parliament,,
7.    The Government1 s work has however got to be carried on, -andthe following arrangements should therefore apply in relation to business which would normally be handled in the course of hisordinary departmental responsibilities by a Minister who hasdecided to differ from the Government&apos;s recommendation:-(a) Ministerial&apos;   meetings in   Brussels must be attended by a Minister who supports the Government&apos;s recommend-ations or, failing that, by Sir Michael Palliser,supported by officials from London as necessary.(b) In dealing with Parliamentary&quot; Questions and ScrutinyCommittee work Ministers who are differing/ fromthe Government&apos;s recommendation will have,  in con-sulta.ti.on with their Permanent Secretaries and withthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and me as necessary, to exercise restraint and good sense.    Itwould clearly not be appropriate for them to answer. Questions themselves which are relevant to renegotiatioror the referendum campaign, and it will be necessaryto make arrangements during this period for such questions to be answered by Ministers who supportthe Governments recommendation.(c) Permanent Secretaries should be responsible for seeing that any instructions sent to Sir Michael Palliseror briefing for Whitehall officials going to Brusselsare in line with Government policy:  and civilservants in every department should co-operate fully in this.I am asking the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to accept responsibility for the general oversight of these arrangements,and specifically for approving arrangements on Ministerialattendance in Brussels and on answering Parliamentary Questions.
S.    The fact that the Government has made a recommendation    /also has certain implications for the conduct of civilservants during the referendum campaign.9.    Civil servants may provide factual information on Europeanmatters on request to the Ministers who differ from theGovernments recommendation, but they should not be askedto provide briefing or draft speeches contrary to the government&apos;s recommendation.    Copies of all material providedby civil servants for campaigning Ministers (whether they arecampaigning for or against the Government&apos;s recommendation),should be sent to the Cabinet Office.10.    The question of civil servants campaigning in the referendum is to be discussed with the National Staff Side.Our initial line will be that civil servants in the&quot;politically free&quot; and &quot;intermediate&quot; groups will be free to campaign in the referendum, if they so wish.    Civilservants in the &quot;politically restricted&quot; group who are ialready debarred from engaging in national political activities should avoid taking any public part in the referendum campaign.  -11-.    Special Advisers are in a different position.    As temp or a civil servants they are required to resign before playing apublic role in a general election.    They should similarlyresign if they wish to play a public role in the referendumcampaign: but as the personal advisers to their Ministersthey are naturally free to help him on his research,  speeches.,etc., even if that Minister is exercising his right to differ.18   March 1975
