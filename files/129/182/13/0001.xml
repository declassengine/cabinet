DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTy - &quot; r. &apos; \ Iilil rj&apos;C(75) 38 COPY NO       8218 March 1975CABINETREPORT ON TOP SALARIES: TOP SALARIES review body &quot;CONSEQUENTIALS&quot;Memorandum by the Lord Chancellorlc At itB meeting on 13 March the Ministerial Committee on economic policy decided that for the time being no increases in salary should be givento the holders of appointments not directly covered by the Top salaries review Body&apos;s (TSRB!s) recent Report on Top Salaries (Cmnd 5846) eventhough the salaries of those concerned would normally be adjusted as aresult of the TSRB&apos;s recommendations.    The Committee accepted theLord Privy Seal&apos;s argument that because some of the so-called&quot;consequentials&quot; had a clear link with the nationalised industry posts forwhich we refused increases last December, all other &quot;consequentials&quot;, eventhose which had no such link, ehotild equally be refused on the ground thatit would be anomalous in this context to attempt to distinguish between oneappointment and another.    I cannot believe that this was right and I shouldbe grateful if my Cabinet colleagues would consider the matter afresh.2.        The appointments in question bear little relation to one another.Some have a direct link with the judiciary and of these some are in factjudicial posts which are in practice indistinguishable from comparable postsdealt with in the TSRB Report.    I set out in the annex to this memoranduma list of the appointments directly linked with the judiciary where increases in salary have hitherto always followed increases in judicial salaries.Other appointments where consequential increases in salary might now beexpected following on the TSRB Report are more closely linked with thehigher Civil Service and their salaries cannot in any sense be said to havebeen fixed by reference to salaries in the nationalised industries or theprivate sector.3,        There was no good reason - apart, in some cases, from theaccidental date of creation of the post - why the appointments I am most directly concerned with should not have been mentioned in the TSRB report but have been left to be dealt with as &quot;consequentials&quot;.    To take only oneexample, no possible distinction can be drawn for this purpose between thePresident of the Industrial Tribunals, who was included in the TSRB Report,
and the President of the Value-Added Tax Tribunals, who was not, exceptthat the last-mentioned post was presumably created just too late for it tobe specifically referred to in the list of appointments which the TSRB was asked to consider.40 The complete inappropriateness of the Economic Policy Committee1 decision is strikingly illustrated by considering the position of the LawCommissioner ss for whom I have a special responsibility.    Mypredecessors and I have always sought to appoint lawyers of particulardistinction in their own fields to the Law Commission and a labour government does not need to be reminded of the outstanding importance ofthe work done by the Commission,    Ever since it was set up it has beenaccepted that the Commissioners&apos; salaries would exceed those payable to the Circuit Judges.    To allow the Commissioners now to fall substantiallybehind those Judges while at the same time giving the Chairman of theCommission a large increase in his salary as a High Court Judge - to say nothing of the fact that the Secretary of the Commission, as an Under-Secretary in the Civil Service, is at present receiving a larger salary thanthe Commissioners do - would create an anomaly worse than any of those to which the Lord Privy Seal drew the Economic Policy Committeelsattention.5. I recognise that, whatever we do, some anomalies are inevitable,but we should surely keep these to the minimum.    In view of bur earlier decision about the chairmen and board members of nationalised industriesit may not now be practicable to give consequential increases to those whoseposts have firm or generally understood links either with the nationalised industries or with the private sector.    I do not think it would be undulydifficult to identify the posts concerned.    Such a decision could not be attacked as illogical, whatever else might be said of it.    But to go further and refuse increases to holders of the posts I have mentioned merely because they do not happen to have been referred to in the TSRB Report,could not, in my view be defended in logic, justice or common sense andI do not think we ought to allow ourselves to be forced into this position.E lord Chancellor^ Office18 March 1975
