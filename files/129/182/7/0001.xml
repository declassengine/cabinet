IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PR. OPE P. TY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 32 COPY NO g 214 March 1975CABINETPARLIAMENT AND e.c. legislation memorandum by the Lord President of the council. Legislation Committee were given a remit to study the role ofParliament in relation to Community legislation in the context of ourrenegotiation objectives.    The Committee have held five meetings inconnection with this study and have taken 11 papers on its    Cabinet on27 February (CC(75) 10th Conclusions^ Minute 4) decided that theCommittee&apos;s conclusions should be considered in the context of the generalstocktaking on renegotiation.    The Committee have reached no agreed conclusions, and they agreed that for the purpose of our stocktaking I should submit a report to Cabinet setting out the basic issues as seen by theCommittee, the options considered, and the Committee&apos;s views on them.My report is attached in the Annex.- 112. In my view we now have a clear choice before us:a. We could, against the view of the majority of legislation committee, seek some form of amendment to or derogation fromArticle 189s in order to remove or limit the concept of directlyapplicable Community legislation.    But this concept is so centralto the operation of the Community that the other members are likelyto look upon such a proposal as a &quot;wrecking amendment&quot; whichcannot succeed; orb. We can accept that remaining in the Community necessarilyresults in some limitation on Parliaments direct control overlegislation in those fields which relate to the work of the community and that it must therefore be the Governments responsibility toprotect the United Kingdom interest in the Council.    Procedures canhowever be developed to enable Parliament to exercise a realinfluence on the Community law-making process through its general political control over the Government, by making the scrutinyarrangements more effective and by enabling Parliament to expressits views on the right issues in the right form at the right time;  and
c. As an extension of b.. we could amend the european communities Act 1972 to enact a statutory declaration of the sovereignty of Parliament;  or to require the prior approval by affirmative Resolution of Parliament before the Government commitsthe United Kingdom in the Council on matters of exceptionalimportance; or to embody the scrutiny and related procedures instatutory form.3. Our White Paper on Renegotiation must make clear what the positionis on the sovereignty issue, and it ought to include a statement of our general Intentions.    Work developing these Parliamentary proceduresshould be urgently pursued so that we are ready to respond positively to theProcedure Committee!s Report and able to take appropriate early actionafter the referendum.E privy Council Office14 March 19752
CONFIDENTLYANNEXPARLIAMENT AND e.c. LEGISLATIONREPORT ON DISCUSSIONS IN LE&amp;Legislation COMMITTEEThe issues1.     The Committee has considered to what extent membership of the. Communityentails limitations on the sovereignty of Parliament and, to the extent thatit does, how far those limitations may be removed or lessened, consistently with continued membership.   The fundamental question whether those limi-tations, such as they are, are acceptable will have to be weighed in thebalance with the other advantages and disadvantages of membership of theCommunity, and will form an element in the Governments overall judgement on whether or not to recommend continued membership.2.    Any treaty we sign with other countries involves some limitation of our national sovereignty in return for some advantage.   The fulfilment of treaty obligations often depends on legislative action by Parliament.   Inthe case of the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities the legis-lative action took the form of the European Communities Act 1972.3.     The particular issue for Parliament in this case arises from the uniquecharacter of the Treaties of Rome and Paris which involve the acceptanceof certain types of Community instrument as directly applicable atlaw in the member states.   The concept of directly applicable Community &apos;law is essential to the way the Community operates in practice:   without itimplementation of agreed common policies would be uncertain and protracted.By passing the European Communities Act 1972 Parliament has provided thatdirectly applicable Community instruments will have the force of law in the uk.   Parliament can undoubtedly exercise its ultimate sovereignty by re-pealing the 1972 Act, thus in effect talcing us out of the Community:   the referendum demonstrates this.   The continuance of direct applicability of community law in the UK therefore depends ultimately on Parliament&apos;s con-tinuing assent to our membership of the Community.   But, as members, we arein a situation -   unprecedented in this country - of accepting aspart of our law provisions to be made in the future by instruments issuedby the Community institutions.1
4.     Within the Community^ legislative process however there exists apotent safeguard for national sovereignty in the form of the LuxembourgCommunique on unanimity in matters of vital national interest.   This isa safeguard which can only be exercised by the Government.   The extentto which the Government should allow its exercise of the &quot;veto&quot; to besubject to Parliament&apos;s instructions has been relevant to much of theCommittee1s discussion.5.     The Committee identified a further aspect of the sovereignty question,that of conflict between Parliament&apos;s powers of legislation and those ofthe Community institutions.   In the jurisprudence of the Community court -which, in conformity with the Treaties, is acknowledged in Sction 3(1) ofthe 1972 Act - directly applicable Community law prevails over conflictingnational legislation.   This is a logical consequence of the concept of a community law which is directly applicable in all member states:   the merits of this universality of application would be lost if the Communityprovision could be overridden, perhaps even inadvertently, by a nationalenactment.   The Attorney General has advised the Committee that there isno doubt of Parliaments power to legislate, contrary to the 1972 Act, toremove the direct applicability of particular Community provisions -although this would be a fundamental breach of the Treaty, which parliament has no right unilaterally to amend.   The established constitutionalprinciple that no Parliament can bind its successors, would require the UKcourts to uphold the later enactment, although the possibility cannot be ruled out that with the passage of years the courts might come to regard the established constitutional principle as no longer valid and accept the supremacy of the Community court.    Whichever way the conflict developed,
the resultant breach of the Treaty must lead to our either going to theextreme of seceding from the Community or effecting a political solutionwith the Community to deal with the particular matter in cmestion.   thus the issue of conflict of law would in the end adopt a political not ajuridical character.Options6.     The Committee agree that it is essential not to obscure the undisputedfact that Parliament&apos;s control of day-to-day legislation in some areas has&quot;been diminished by accession to the Community.    They have identified twobasic options for dealing with this situation:-(i) to eliminate directly applicable Community legislation for thefuture by - amendment or derogation from the relevant Treaty provisions orby the renunciation of their use:i&apos;(ii) to strengthen the arrangements for Parliamentary scrutiny anddebate of legislative proposals before their adoption by the Council.7.     In addition the Committee considered or asked officials to study threesupplementary options (which, like (ii), do not involve challenging theprinciple of direct applicability):(iii) to enact a statutory declaration of the ultimate sovereignty of11Parliament;(iv) to amend the 1972 Act so as to give Parliament; a greater degreeof control without raising the cuestion of Treaty amendment or derogation;(v) to put the Parliamentary scrutiny procedures into statutory form.Elimination of directly applicable Community legislation8.     The first option would have the effect of restoring full control oflegislation to Parliament.    It embraces a range of possibilities fromseeking amendment of Article 169 of the e.c. Treaty and Article 14 of theECSC Treaty to seeking a derogation from the application of these articles in the UK, or a formal agreement by the Council and the Commission not tomake directly applicable instruments in future.   A minority of the Committeebelieve that to eliminate directly applicable Community legislation andrestore full control of legislation to Parliament is the only acceptableway of dealing with the effect of the Community on Parliament&apos;s sovereignty.3
They consider that we should pursue this objective as a condition of continue!membership of the Community.   The  ^iprit^ do not favour an attempt tosecure amendment of or derogation from the relevant treaty provisions.They consider that it would represent a major departure from the established way the Community works; would hinder the rapid and effective implementation of agreements arrived at in the Council, incertain cases jeopardising the continuance of common policies; and would amount to a new renegotiation demand by the UK of a nature likely to he regarded by our Community partners as inconsistent with membership, solaying the Government open to charges of bad faith.   For these reasons they &amp;no prospect of a favourable response from the Community.   They see the same 1objections to an attempt to seek a general renunciation of directlyapplicable instruments although it may be possible in some areas to make more use of directives and less of regulations.   Provided that adequatearrangements are made for Parliamentary scrutiney and debate (see paras to 13 below)., they do not consider that the problems raised for parliament by the concept of direct applicability are unacceptable.   They considerthat since the existence of directly applicable lav; as an essential partof the Community8s operation must be made clear to the electorate beforethe Referendum, the decision on this point will bo in effect taken bythe Referendum decision.Strengthening of arrangements for Parliamentary scrutiny&apos;; and debate .9.     There is a general agreement on the desirability of strengtheningParliamentary procedures for scrutiny and debate of proposals for Councillegislation, (although a minority of the Committee would regard this as nosubstitute for the restoration to Parliament of full legislative control).These procedures do not and cannot apply to directly applicableCommunity legislation already adopted nor to the exercise of theCommission&apos;s delegated powers.   These procedures would be in additionto the power which Parliament will continue to enjoy to censureMinisters or the Government in respect of their concurrence in
CONFIDENTIAL JCommunity decisions which Parliament may regard as contrary to theinterests of the United Kingdom or part of it.10.   The system we introduced in April and Kay 1974 is now well underway.   Following the Committee&apos;s decision on 19 November 1974 the commons Scrutiny Committee has been provided with special administrativesupport and it has now largely mastered the problems associated with its initial backlog of instruments to be considered..   Despite earlier diffi-culties of Parliamentary handling, recent scrutiny debates have shownthat the system is capable of developing into an effective and flexibleinstrument of Parliamentary control, given adequate consultation throughthe usual channels on timing, form of motion etc.11.   As part of its consideration of options for the future the Committeecommissioned&apos; studies by officials of the relevant parliamentary proceduresin other Member States, in particular West Germany, Denmark and the irish republic.    It has become clear that the practice in these countries-is not relevant to our own constitutional situation and that the adoption of their .procedures would not help us.12.   The Committee has considered ways of improving our&apos;own Parliamentary -procedures.   As a result I submitted evidence to the Select Committee on procedure suggesting that debates recommended by the Scrutiny Committeeon SEC proposals of second-line importance should be referred to a newStanding Committee or Committees.    I also suggested that such Committeesmight consider &quot;prayers&quot; against items not recommended for debate by the scrutiny Committee.   If the suggestion of Standing Committees is taken up this would reduce the pressure of business on the Floor of the house and might leave the way open for a two-stage procedure for the mostimportant Community proposals; one stage in Standing Committee and one onthe Floor of the House.   The first debate, might be held while the proposal isstill at en early stage in the Council, so allowing Parliament to influence theGovernment&apos;s conduct of further negotiations, with a second debate when the detailed Council negotiations are hearing completion (there were two such debatesboth on the Floor - on the draft regulation on the Regional Development Fund).These debates would be analogous to &quot;Green Paper and &quot;white Paperdebates respectively.    It has also been suggested that afn&apos;i 11 i iiiiiiiw I tit 11111 am 1 iwi 111......111 TWMiiMiimi 11111 iiimiii iiiUi -mi wn.......
category of the most important proposals might he defined on which the Governmentwould accept the need to obtain a more positive form of approval from Parliament -eg under something  like the affirmation resolution procedure for UK subordinate legislation - before giving final approval in Brussels.     Much more radically,it has been suggested that in some cases proposals might be made subject to full primary legislation procedure before UK Ministers could agree to their adoption in the Council, although this did not command general support in theCommitt ee.13.   To the extent that adoption of any of these alternative procedures increasedParliament&apos;s detailed control it would of course correspondingly limit Ministers&apos;freedom to negotiate in the Council in the national interest.   Any requirement that Parliament should debate the final text of proposals before they are formallyadopted by the Council would entail changes in the Council&apos;s normal workingprocedure of such magnitude that agreement could not be expected.     Bearing inmind these cautions however there is general agreement that the Parliamentaryprocedures for scrutiny and debate of proposed Council legislation should be strengthened.     Detailed decisions must await consideration of the report ofthe Select Committee on Procedure.     In the meantime further work should becarried out on possible improvements.     It might- be worth while for the Governmentto make an early, statement that they are considering ways of strengtheningParliament&apos;s procedures in this area and indicating some of the directions inwhich changes might be made.Supplementary opt ions14.    Statutory declaration of ultimate sovereignty of Parliament;    This wouldnot increase Parliament&apos;s day-tc-day control of Community legislation.     Itwould give the status of statute law to Parliaments inherent power to repealor amend the 1972 Act.     This power has not hitherto been questioned.     a minority of the Committee consider that a statutory declaration of the ultimatesovereignty of Parliament could help avoid a possible: constitutional crisesbetween Parliament and the UK ,courts if Parliament exercised its power to override directly applicable Community law.     They think it would be a helpfullong-term safeguard which given careful presentation need not give rise toi 1 &apos;misconceptions.     The n^joritv, consider that such a declaration would be amisleading nullity which would have no effect even in a future situation of constitutional conflict;   would be contrary to normal constitutional practice;and would give rise to suspicion among our Community partners -as well as misconceptat home. ^
15*   Amendments to 1972 Act compatible with Treaty:   Officials have studied the amendments tabled during the passage of the 1972 Act.    It is clear that noamendment which restores control to Parliament by infringing the principle ofdirectly applicable Community lav/ can be made without raising the question of treaty amendment or derogation.   There is scope for tightening up the conditions set out in Schedule 2 of the Act for the use of subordinate legislation under theAct to implement non-directly-applicable Community obligations.    This would meanmore primary legislation, with a consequent increase in detailed parliamentary control.    It is of course open to the Government by administrative decision tomake greater use, of primary legislation in this area without amending the 1972Act &apos;  The Committee have not discussed this option in detail, but it appears thatamendments to Schedule 2 of the 1972 Act to tighten up the conditions for use of subordinate legislation under the Act would he of only marginal-value in relationto the main debate on sovereignty and could not, of themselves, provide an amendment Bill of any substance.   They would also lead to a continuing additionto the number of essential Bills in the legislative programmes of future sessions.16.   Puttingiscrutiny,procedures in statxitory form:   This option has been studied by officials.   To embody the existing or&apos;modified scrutinyvprocedures instatute would not increase their effectiveness since there can be no sanctionagainst the Executive other than the withdrawal of confidence, which is possibleeven if the procedures are not made statutory.   Nor could a. failure by theGovernment to observe a statutory Parliamentary procedure before agreeing to legislation in the Council of Ministers invalidate that legislation, provided thatthe Council&apos;s own procedure had been correctly observed.   Finally, to embody the scrutiny procedures in statute would not be to entrench them for the future sinceeach House would doubtless wish to insist on its ability to continue to regulateits own procedures by Resolution.   While the Committee have not discussed thisoption in detail, it seems clear that it would have little practical effect andwould be a questionable departure from&apos;Parliamentary convention.
