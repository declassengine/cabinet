DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 36 COPY NO  \18 March 1975CABINETPHASING OUT PRIVATE PRACTICE FROM THE national health service note by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesParagraph 5 of C(75) 27 has been discussed with the Treasury since thepaper was circulated to colleagues.    I should make it clear that the figureof  20 million referred to in that paragraph is based on the assumptionthat the former pay beds would not be vised more intensively by national health Service patients.    If they were used more intensively the cost ofphasing could rise to  25 million in a full year but the timing of this would depend on the timetable for the necessary legislation for phasing out.There is unlikely to be any additional cost in 1975-76; in 1976-77 it could beas much as S.lZj million.    Thereafter the full cost would be incurred.B A department of Health and Social Security18 March 1975
