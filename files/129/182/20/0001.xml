Paragraphs41 to 43 of that White Paper explained that the legislation would take theform of an enabling Act containing power to adapt the existing machinery byan Order and that a draft of that Order would be published as soon as possible after the Bill had been introduced.2. The Referendum Bill was introduced on 26 March.
