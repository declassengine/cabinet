CONFIDENTIAL-FINAL REVISE[to be published as Command 6020 by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery office price 22p net]Food from our Own Resources
FOOD FROM OUR OWN RESOURCES/ introduction. This White Paper examines the prospects and policies for food pro-duction from our own resources of land and labour over the next five toten years. It does not deal with production from the resources of the sea.It concerns directly those who work or invest in the agricultural industryand in food processing and distribution. But the whole nation has an interest in the best use of our resources and in a reliable and fairly pricedsupply of food to our tables.2. The Government have held discussions with representatives of farmers,workers, landowners and the food and drink industries on the longer termprospects and objectives for United Kingdom agriculture and have alsoconsulted representatives of consumers on the outcome. The Governmenthave reached their own conclusions in the light of these discussions and of official studies but in many important respects the Government and theindustry are in agreement on the objectives for our own agriculture to1980.3. This is an appropriate time to re-examine the prospects for UnitedKingdom agriculture and to restate the objectives of agricultural policy.World prices for some important food and feed commodities rose verysteeply in the last two or three years, thus reversing some of the earlierprice relationships between domestic and imported products. Among these commodities are cereals and protein feeds which, as major raw materials of livestock production, influence the cost of production of milk, pigs,poultry, eggs and other livestock products. At the same time the higher prices of energy and other inputs have raised the costs of food production to new levels. Forecasting commodity prices is always difficult but, although some prices have now fallen back, a return to a period of low food priceslike that of the 1960s is not regarded as likely.4. The Government take the view that a continuing expansion of foodproduction in Britain will be in the national interest. It is mainly the costin sterling terms of alternative supplies from abroad which determineswhether expansion of home production is economically worthwhile and,if so, to what extent; and the expectation now is that the cost of importingfood and feed will be higher, relative to other prices, than over most of thepast two decades. On this view, price trends will themselves provide an incentive for higher output; but the objective of Government policy will beto provide farmers with a prospect of stability in their returns at levelsencouraging the greater home production which would give the countryan insurance against periods of shortage and higher prices. The basicconclusion that a continuing increase in the output of our own agricultureover the next five years will be economically worthwhile is drawn froman assessment of the price and availability of imported food and feed and,in the view of the Government, would remain economically valid, whetheror not the United Kingdom decided to stay within the European Com-munity. , (
THE FOOD SUPPLY TO 19805. The starting point for the determination of priorities for our ownagricultural industry is an assessment of changes in the availability and cost of our food supplies. Consumers&apos; expenditure on food, which accounts for just under a quarter of all consumers&apos; expenditure, is estimated to beabout  11,400 million in 1974. Over the decade to 1972 expenditure on food rose at an average rate of about 5 per cent a year. Between 1972and 1974, however, expenditure rose at the rate of 15 per cent a year as a result of the exceptional increases in the prices of basic food materials.The movements in imported food, farmgate and retail prices have been:Table united KINGDOM FOOD PRICESFood import        Farmgate       Consumer pricesprices prices for foodo/ 0/ 0//o &apos;        /o /oAnnual percentagechange1962 to 1972   ......       4.2 3.5 4.51972 to 1974    ...      ...      31.2 22.5 14.36. The effect of the rapid increases in world food prices on the UnitedKingdom&apos;s food and total trade deficit has been considerable. Between1972, when the prices of cereals and protein feeds on world markets rosesharply, and 1974 the United Kingdom&apos;s net deficit in trade in food andbeverages rose from  1,750 million to nearly  3,000 million (Annex I).The import bill for food and feed rose by some  1,500 million; the increasedue to higher prices was about  1,700 million but this was offset to someextent by a decline in the volume of imports. In comparison, the increasein our oil trade deficit since the recent oil price rise has been some  2,500million.7. Recently world cereal prices have fallen back from peak levels, asthe number of livestock in some important consuming countries has beenreduced. Nevertheless, the changes in the world prices for important foodcommodities and their effect on our import bill have been so great thatit is essential to try to judge whether high price levels will be maintainedor increased or whether a return to much lower levels is likely. This judg-ment is difficult. There are, however, some general considerations whichbear directly on it. They point to the conclusion that over the next fiveto ten years there will not be a return to the situation in which foodstuffsare available for long periods on world markets at prices below the costof production in the producing country. Supply and demand are expectedto be more nearly in balance. The amount of food traded on world marketsis small in relation to total demand and small changes in supply or demandare likely to have a large effect on the price of foods traded internationally.Supply and price fluctuations are more likely and world food prices moreuncertain.
8. A projection of world demand for food made by the United nations for the period to 1985 assumes a growth of world population of 2 per cent a year. If an assumed rate of growth of per caput incomes only half ofthat achieved in recent years is added, the growth in world food demandimplied over the ten year period is 25 per cent. In developed countries,where population growth is less rapid, the rise in food demand would beabout 13 per cent but in developing countries it could be as high as 33per cent. Increases in world food demand of this magnitude would be bound to place severe strains on the world&apos;s food producing resources.In the short term many countries will be unable to raise their agricultural production to meet these demands. The World Food Conference recom-mended that at least 10 million tons of grain should be provided as food aid each year from 1975 to meet pressing needs. It is also possible that countries such as the USSR and China, where there is a rising demandfor meat and livestock products, may again wish to make large purchasesabroad of cereals and other animal feedingstuffs. Heavy pressure on world production is likely, at the same time as attempts are being made to rebuildheavily depleted stocks. There can hardly fail to be an increasing world demand over the next few years for cereals and protein feeds.9. Food supply prospects are not easy to assess. Cereals and animalfeedingstuffs are the most important indicators. The United States and canada account for two thirds of world cereal exports and the UnitedStates for 90 per cent of world exports of soya beans, the most importantsource of concentrated protein. At the end of this season the stocks ofcereals held by the main exporting countries are expected to be only about one third of the level in 1972. Changes in supply and demand now havea more direct effect on prices since the cushion provided by stocks is much reduced. If supplies increase, stocks will be replenished. It will take timeand a series of good harvests to rebuild them, and possibly also someinternational action on co-ordinated stockholding in the interests of world security in food grains. They may not, however, be reconstituted to their former size. In the short term there are also some specific restraints onthe expansion of production. World supplies of nitrogenous fertiliser maybe short over the next two to three years until manufacturing capacity hasbeen increased. The higher prices for energy, fertilisers and machineryare raising agricultural production costs directly. For some countries this may mean lower food output because they cannot meet the foreign ex-change cost of importing the materials at the new higher prices.10. The influence of the United Kingdom as a buyer in world marketsis also changing. In 1960 United Kingdom imports of wheat and of coarse grains represented about 12 and 20 per cent respectively of world trade.In 1974 our imports are likely to represent only about 5 per cent of world trade. The influence which the United Kingdom can exercise on world price levels for primary commodities is now substantially less than in the1960s. Our slow economic growth of recent years has also meant that ourbuying power has continued to decline relative to that of other countries.11. The effects of a depreciating currency on our food import bill are considerable. Each one per cent change in the value of the   sterling when
worked through into prices could add some  35 million to our food importbill. So far we have been partly protected from the effects of recent depreci-ation by our membership of the European Community. In particular, theCommunity finances certain food import subsidies (monetary compensatoryamounts) reflecting the difference between the market value of the  sterling and a fixed representative rate (the Green  ). In considering possiblelevels of higher production from our own resources, however, we need tovalue that production at the market rate.12. Some 70 per cent of food consumed in the United Kingdom has beenprocessed to a greater or lesser extent, much of it in the United Kingdomitself. The value of this processing to the national economy is considerable;in 1973 it contributed some 2 per cent to gross domestic product in additionto the 2.7 per cent contributed by agriculture. For many commodities,however, the size of the processing industry is limited by the level of domestic production of the basic food raw materials. An expanding home agriculture would also provide the basis for a bigger United Kingdom foodprocessing industry. Not only would some agricultural imports be replacedbut there would also be a benefit to the economy and to employment fromthe value added by United Kingdom processors. Similarly, a continuinghigh level of agricultural activity would be of benefit to United Kingdomsupplying industries, particularly agricultural machinery production.13. In considering the contribution which United Kingdom agriculture can make to the domestic economy the Government have also been mindful ofthe world food situation and the interests of the developing countries, both as consumers and producers. Where we can organise our productionpatterns so as to reduce our demand on the world availability of food grains,for example by making the most of our grassland production, this can be helpful; and perhaps in appropriate cases we may be able to make a contri-bution from home production towards the requirements of food aidprogrammes. In the total development of world trade in agricultural products it is important to frame our policies with regard to the interestsof developing countries as producers, particularly of those commodities which we do not grow ourselves. For these commodities, what is now required is a new initiative with the aim of producing international agree-ment on individual commodities directed to stability of trade at reasonable prices so as to give consumers an assured supply and producers assuredmarkets and returns. The Government intend to press ahead on these issues, commodity by commodity, and to discuss them with all the otherGovernments concerned.UNITED KINGDOM AGRICULTURE : performance and PROSPECTS14. Over the last quarter of a century domestic agricultural production has more than kept pace with the growth in population. United Kingdomfarmers have increased their contribution to the nation&apos;s food supply toabout two-thirds of the total supply of the commodities which can beproduced here. This has been achieved with a much reduced work force,
a declining acreage and a level of support which bears comparison withthat given to some other major industries. The trends of output, netagricultural product and of employment in agriculture are in Annex II.15. The last year has been a difficult period for some sectors of UnitedKingdom agriculture, particularly livestock production. In 1974/75 theindex of the net product of United Kingdom agriculture is expected to beunchanged. Labour productivity continued to improve; over the decade1964/65 to 1974/75 it improved by about 6 per cent annually, about twice the average of industry generally, but the rate of improvement has tended to slow down. The aggregate net income of the agricultural industry, afterrising steeply in 1973/74, fell in 1974/75 by 12 per cent. In real terms theaggregate net income fell by 26 per cent. At the 1975 Annual Review cost increases since the previous Review were assessed at  692 million, not far below the record  712 million for the preceding year and substantially above any other annual cost increases recorded. The cereal crop of about16 million tons was a record but production of some major livestock pro-ducts, particularly milk and pigs, fell back. It is realistic to acknowledge the difficulties of 1974 and the effect on confidence. In view of the greatlyincreased costs both of running a farm business and of further investmentfarmers have adopted a cautious approach. But the underlying structure and potential of United Kingdom agriculture remain strong.16. The present pattern and level of output United Kingdom self-sufficiency in the major food products is shown in Annex III is the product of different factors. In assessing the possibility of higher output,the Government and the industry have to take account of the limits set by these factors of production, particularly land and labour.The area of agricultural land, currently about 47 million acres, is steadilydeclining. Precise information on land transfers between different uses isnot available but over the five years to 1972/73 the average loss of agri-cultural land in the United Kingdom was about 144 thousand acres a year.Of this, 69 thousand acres a year was transferred to forest and woodland,whilst most of the remainder was permanently lost to urban, industrial and recreational uses. Much of the latter was good quality land and, if this rateof loss were to continue, this would imply a substantial reduction in theavailable agricultural land over the period 1975 to 1980. Government policyis to ensure that, wherever possible, agricultural land of a higher qualityis not taken for, development where land of lower quality is available. but clearly the loss of productive farmland at this rate is of great importancewhen considering the scope for higher output.17. Agricultural workers will have a key part to play if higher output is to be achieved. Looking to the future and to continuing advances intechnology, the level of skills within the work force will assume increasing importance; and workers will need adequate incentives and facilities toacquire and sustain the necessary standard of skills. Incentives are amatter for the industry itself, whether on the part of individual employersand employees or nationally through the medium of the agricultural wages Board, which has paved the way with its premium structure forcraftsmen and graded workers. In addition, the industry needs young re-
emits. In 1974 there was a record level of recruits to the Agricultural Train-ing Board&apos;s training scheme for new entrants. The Government are con-cerned that the Training Board should have the resources necessary to fulfil its part in equipping the industry with a sufficiently large and skilledwork force.18. The realisation of potentially higher output depends also on theefficiency of research, development and the dissemination to farmers ofthe latest information and techniques. The rapid growth in agriculturalproductivity over the last two decades has been materially helped by thesuccessful application of research findings. The yields of cereals, potatoes,field vegetables and fruit, the growth rates of beef cattle, the yields of milk cows and the feed conversion ratio of pigs and poultry have all bene-fited directly from research findings. Quality of produce has benefitedfrom scientific advances in the control of pests and diseases. National re-organisation in line with Lord Rothschild&apos;s recommendations is already taking effect in the closer integration of research and development with agricultural progress. A continuing investment in the scientific improve-ment of agricultural technology will be essential to obtain more food from our own resources.19. There is considerable scope for higher production not only throughthe development and eventual uptake of research findings but also throughthe more widespread application of the proven techniques already beingpractised by leading farmers. The agricultural advisory services in theUnited Kingdom are second to none and through them the Governmentgives important backing to farming progress. The advisory services continueto have a major contribution to make in testing and demonstrating therelevance of new technical and scientific knowledge to a wide range ofcommercial farming situations. Experimental stations and specialist advisershave an important part to play in developing and evaluating new methods toa point where they can be recommended with confidence to advisers andfarmers. By continuously seeking to identify the main impediments toimproved productivity, the Agricultural Development and Advisory service has directed its efforts towards promoting the technology most - suitablefor practising farmers. In so doing it has recognised the problems of indi-vidual producers. At the same time as, for example, in the current cam-paign to improve the management and use of grassland it is directingspecially co-ordinated efforts towards the more important general problemsrestricting agricultural output.HIGHER OUTPUT: THE PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES20. Against this background the Government have examined, in con-sultation with the industry, the technical possibilities for higher output andthe case for the use of resources. The Farmers&apos; Unions have publishedseparately the details of their estimates of potentially higher production,commodity by commodity. They have set out two assessments of the pos-sible pattern of production in 1979/80. Recognising the competition be-tween arable crops and grass-fed livestock for the available land at the
margin, the Unions have set out one projection which envisages a sub-stantially bigger cattle herd (16.3 million by June 1979 compared with15.2 million at June 1974) with a small increase in the cereal acreage (9.5 million acres by June 1979 compared with 9.26 million acres at June 1974).The other projection envisages a small increase in the cattle herd (15.4 million by June 1979) with a large increase in the acreage of cereals (10million acres by June 1979) and sugar beet (700 thousand acres by June1979). The two projections do not otherwise differ. Some expansion ofthe sheep flock is looked for. For pork, poultry and eggs the projectionsare mainly directed to meeting additional demand. For horticulture theUnions foresee changes in the output of certain products but, taking horticulture-culture as a whole, they expect only a small increase in the volume oftotal output in this period. On either projection the total increase in output,compared with the average of 1973/74 and 1974/75, would be worth some 770-815 million by 1979/80 and the net import saving would be of theorder of  555-570 million.The case for expansion21. The Government are in broad agreement with the Farmers&apos; unions on the order of magnitude of the increase in output which it is feasible toobtain by 1980. But agricultural expansion requires resources. The twobasic questions that have to be answered are whether expansion of this order represents the right use of the necessary resources; and, if so,what should be the priorities for expansion and what broad pattern ofagricultural production should be the objective.22. The assessment of the case for expansion turns on two considerations.The first is the comparative cost, in terms of resources, of importing from overseas the food and feed which under an expansion programme could beproduced at home. In economic terms, it is the expected level of prices in sterling terms at which alternative supplies will be available whichdetermines the extent to which the expansion of home production is worth-while. It is necessary to take a view on the prospects for some years inadvance. The second is the extent to which expansion is justified simply soas to reduce the risks to the economy, in terms both of import prices andthe reliability of supplies, involved in a relatively high level of dependence on imports.23. Decisions about expansion, for the Government as for the farmer,are generally long-term decisions. The prospect of higher market returnsshould in itself give farmers an incentive to plan for- greater output. Butit is not enough to rely on the expectation of future market price move-ments to bring about an expansion of production. If farmers are to investin expansion, they need a degree of assurance about their future returns.It is the function of agricultural support policy to provide sufficient assur-ance about the level and stability of these returns, particularly where largefluctuations in market prices are likely, to enable the farmer to plan ahead with confidence.24. It is, therefore, necessary to form a view about prospects over aperiod of some years to help us in shaping and implementing our agricultural
policies. Earlier paragraphs have considered the factors affecting world food and feed prices over the next five years. Over the last two or threeyears world food prices have increased much more than those of manu-factured goods (Annex IV). The Government regard it as likely that over the next five years world food prices, while possibly fluctuatingconsiderably, will do so about a level higher, in relation to the price of manufactured goods, than that experienced in the 1960s. This means thatthe relationship between the cost of importing foodstuffs of the kind whichwe can produce here and the cost of increasing our own production ofthem has changed materially in favour of increasing home production. Thecost of our food imports will vary according to whether or not the UnitedKingdom remains a member of the European Community. But on eitherhypothesis the Government have concluded that a continuing expansion ofagricultural production of the order set out in later paragraphs is justified by the likely resource cost of alternative imports of food and feed.25. There are greater risks than in the past of wide fluctuations in price and of world shortages. These risks threaten both our balance of payments and the cost of food to the consumer. Agricultural expansion represents a partial insurance against them.26. The case for expansion is sustained by the industry&apos;s record ofincreasing efficiency. Agriculture^ productivity record is good and it doesnot rely intensively on imported materials. From the mid 1950s to 1970 thetotal agricultural labour force declined on average at the rate of 3 per cent a year. This rate clearly could not be maintained indefinitely and since 1970has fallen to about 2 per cent a year. In future the growth in labour produc-tivity will depend more on higher output rather than on a combination of this and a declining labour force. The finite area of good quality land decliningwith the annual loss to other uses imposes a constraint on increased output. The increases in energy and fertiliser costs are an additional handi-cap. Nonetheless, the Government are satisfied that the net product of theagricultural industry, which has increased at the rate of some 2i per cent a year over the last decade, is capable of continued growth at a rate atleast equal to this; and that growth at about this rate is likely to be economically worthwhile.27. The case for expansion varies from commodity to commodity. TheGovernment have examined the case for higher production of individual commodities and have sought to assess priorities as between some importantproducts which compete with each other for land and resources. On thebasis of this assessment they have sought to construct a revised projectionof the higher level of output which is likely to be economically justifiablebetween now and the early 1980s. The projection does not constitute ahard and fast programme. It is intended rather as defining a framework within which the Government will decide their own policies -including,if the United Kingdom remains a member of the European Community,their approach to the development of the common agricultural policy; andas an indication of what the Government believe the industry can achieve.
Cereals28. The United Kingdom imports annually about 7-8 million tons ofcereals out of a total requirement of about 22-23 million tons. Of these imports about 3-4 million tons are wheat (some 2 million tons of north american hard wheats for milling and about H million tons of feed wheat from other e.c. countries) and about 2i-31 million tons are maize used inanimal feed and in food manufacturing. Since 1969 the proportion of home-grown wheat in all wheat milled to produce flour has risen from about a third to almost half, partly in response to the higher prices of north american wheats. But we could not substitute much more without some changes in baking technology or in the kind of bread we eat or without some switch of home production to lower-yielding bread-making wheats.Similarly, because of the needs of the distilling, starch, glucose and foodindustries and the efficiency of maize as a feed for certain livestock, thereis only limited scope for substituting home-grown cereals for importedmaize. The immediate prospect for higher output may therefore be mainly in feed grains, while research, development and other practical measuresto raise the proportion of home-grown wheat in the bread grist should be pressed forward.29. In world trade cereals are the most important group of products.Directly and indirectly, as animal feed they provide most of the world&apos;sstaple food requirements. The state of the world cereal market largelydetermines the state of the temperate food market. Since 1972 world cerealmarkets have been dramatically changed, as stocks have been run downin response to bad harvests in some major producing countries and to higherdemand. In mid-1971 stocks of wheat held by major exporting countriesamounted to about 52 million tons, broadly equivalent to the volume of,world wheat exports. By the end of the current season the international wheat Council is forecasting that stocks held by major exporting countries will be down to 19-21 million tons, about one third of present world trade.Cereal prices rose sharply, although more recently they have fallen backsome way.&quot;  &apos; &apos; i i      &apos; -       \30. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nationsestimates that by 1980 the developing countries may increase their depend-ence on imported cereals, so that these imports represent about 6 per cent of their demand (in 1969-1971 imported cereals represented 1 per cent oftheir demand). It is not clear how far the developing countries will be ableto finance the desired level of cereal imports. But some increase in their imports of cereals by 1980 is certainly to be expected. Technically the developed world should be able to meet these demands and to avoid ashortage of cereals. Recent changes in the prices of energy, fertilisers andother inputs have established a new floor in farmers&apos; costs of producingcereals in the major exporting countries. The costs of North Americanwheat growers will clearly have a greater importance in establishing theprice of cereals as long as stocks remain at a low level. In the past, becauseof higher yields, the greater use of fertilisers and increased mechanisation,costs have risen more slowly than the increase in the general price level.It seems unlikely, however, after taking account of productivity, yields,fertiliser prices and land quality, that these unit costs of cereal production
will decline as fast as they did in the years before 1973, and they may rise.North American cereals destined for the world market in the late 1970sare not expected, except perhaps intermittently, to be sold at below thecurrent level of United States&apos; farmers&apos; costs projected forward at today&apos;sprices. This means that, averaging the fluctuations over a number of seasons,prices of grain sold on world markets, including transport and other handlingcosts, are unlikely to fall markedly.31. The floor set by North American growers&apos; costs indicates that someexpansion of cereal production in the United Kingdom by 1980 shouldbe worthwhile and should be competitive with imported supplies.Sugar32. In recent years only about a third of our sugar supplies have comefrom home beet production. Since 1970 there have been only modest in-creases in world sugar production in the face of steadily rising demand.Stock levels were run down and in 1974 world prices rose to excessivelevels. Some of the sugar which we expected under the commonwealth sugar Agreement was not made available and short supplies and difficulties have persisted on our market. More recently the United Kingdom hasbenefited from the substantial subsidies made available by the european community for the purchase of sugar on world markets.33. The European Community, subject to its undertaking on access forsugar from developing countries, is encouraging the production of beetsugar. The United Kingdom quota has recently been raised substantially.In the immediate future increased production from domestic beet sugarshould easily find a market in the United Kingdom. The first task is toraise the acreage sufficiently to produce 1,040,000 tonnes (1.02 million tons)of sugar (the A quota). Thereafter we should aim for production of some.3 million tonnes (1.28 million tons) which should be capable of being produced in existing factories of the British Sugar Corporation, following further reconstruction and expansion, with the present average campaignlength of 120 days. In this event the United Kingdom would be about 50per cent self-sufficient in sugar and about 600,000 acres would be sown tosugar beet. The economic case for more sugar from home production is strong. But an increase above 1.3 million tonnes of sugar would probablyrequire new factory capacity. This would need to be considered duringthe period under review.Other arable crops34. There should be a continuing increase in the volume of oilseed rapeproduced in the United Kingdom. This crop has been generally profitableand market demand is expected to be strong. For potatoes the aim willcontinue to be for self-sufficiency in the main crop. For field vegetableschanges in output should be related to, the needs of the market; some increase in specialisation and in contract farming is likely, in order tomeet the needs of the consumer.
Milk and beef35. Although milk and beef use some imported feed, the potential fromgreater use of home-produced grass is still very great. Measures to im-prove the production and conservation of grass were proposed in a recent report by the Economic Development Committee for Agriculture. TheGovernment announced on 25 February an intensified programme of work by the advisory services and have also set up a study of ways in whichincentives might be adjusted or improved. This year has shown that the livestock industry is vulnerable to the effect of the weather on foddersupplies. It is important that the size of our national herd and flocks shouldnot outrun the pace of improvement in the use of grassland and the conservation of grass. The Government, however, endorse the Unions&apos; viewthat an increase in the stocking rate from 0.64 livestock units per acre in1974 to about 0.72 units per acre in 1979/80 could be achieved. Both theadvisory effort and the study of incentives will be directed to this end. Onthis basis the prospect for milk and beef is as follows.36. Only a small percentage of total world production of milk entersinto international trade, mainly in the form of milk products. New Zealandis the main exporter of butter fat, followed by the surplus exporting countries within the European Community, namely, Denmark, the Nether-lands, the Irish Republic and France. Although there has been a develop-ment of new milk product markets in recent years, particularly in latin america and Asia, the United Kingdom, which imported  327 million of milk products in 1974, remains the dominant import market for butter fat.37. Since international trade involves only a small part of world produc-tion, prices on commercial world markets are sensitive to relatively smallchanges in total supplies. This has been underlined by the reduction in new Zealand&apos;s export surplus in the last three years. The development ofthe world market for butter fat over the next few years will depend bothon the development of production in the main surplus areas, including thecountries of the European Community, and on the import requirements ofthe main consumption areas, particularly North America and the developingmarkets in Asia and Latin America. Over the next few years world market prices could tend to increase relative to price levels in the domestic markets of Western Europe and North America.38. The European Community as a whole is self-sufficient in milk pro-duction (Table 2 in Annex V) and some restraint in common price in-creases over the next few years is to be expected. However, because ofthe transitional arrangements United Kingdom producers of milk and milk products are not yet receiving these prices and could expect improvementin their returns relative to other Community producers. There is scopeduring the period to 1980 for increased output of milk in this country with only a moderate increase in the acreage devoted to dairying. The favour-able climate for the growth of grass makes this country particularly suited to milk production. The industry is efficiently organised with an averageherd size well above that in other countries of the European community and a relatively high yield per cow (Table 1 in Annex V). With the widerapplication of better methods of grassland production and the more general
use of well-known and tried conservation techniques for grass, a higherdensity of dairy cows could be supported without increasing the amountof imported feed required per cow. This will require a sustained effort by government advisory services and by the farming community itself.39. An improvement in productivity from the available land area ofsome 2 per cent per annum is considered to be attainable. A rise in theaverage yield per cow from genetic improvement and the improved health of the dairy herd (for example through better control of mastitis) shouldcontinue to contribute a substantial part of this improvement as in the past.40. Expansion will require new investments (including investments inimproved drainage) and an efficient use of fertilisers, feedingstuffs andother inputs. In order to secure a sustained increase in milk production to1980, dairy farmers will need to have sufficient confidence of a remunera-tive return from their milk and from beef from the dairy herd. while continuing to meet the demand for liquid milk increased home production would supply more butter, cheese and other milk products includingskimmed milk powder which can be a valuable protein food for developing countries. There would be a bigger turnover in our processing plants andmore value added within the United Kingdom. The major milk productmanufacturers have already invested in extra plant, particularly for cheeseproduction, and it would be advantageous to use this as economically aspossible.41. While demand does not seem likely to represent any significantcheck to the prospects for higher milk output in the United Kingdom inthe period to 1980, this is less clear for beef. The common price for beefwithin the European Community is fairly high in relation to world prices,and in 1975/76 the Community as a whole is likely to be almost self-sufficient in beef. The beef producer in the United Kingdom will have to judge whether, on the basis of his own costs, he is able to compete againstproducers within the European Community and the rest of the world. Forthe United Kingdom, which imported some  225 million worth of livecattle and beef in 1974, there may be some scope for the displacement ofimports by home production but there is a continuing need in normal circumstances for some imported specialist cuts for the catering and manu-facturing trades. In the period to 1980 the prospects for the United King-dom&apos;s own exports are limited.42. The Government have established a floor in beef producers&apos; returnsthrough the variable premium system, with intervention buying only asa market support measure at a low level. The beef breeding herd rose very quickly in recent years; between June 1973 and June 1974 it rose by 13per cent. This increase has now levelled off and there were heavy slaughter-ings and low prices in the second half of 1974. There is a good continuingmarket for beef from the specialist beef herd. The analysis of priorities(paragraph 46 below), however, points to the advantage of obtaining more
beef from an expanding dairy herd rather than from a bigger lowlandpure beef herd in the period to 1980.Sheepmeat43. Consumption of mutton and lamb has been falling but imports, whichcost  106 million in 1974, still represent a significant part (43 per cent)of total United Kingdom consumption. The United Kingdom breedingflock has been expanding since 1972. There is scope for some increase in productivity, notably from improvement in flock management and a re-duction in lamb mortality. The Government expect that in the period to 1980 home production can meet a larger share of domestic demand.There could also be some further development of United Kingdom exportsto other member states of the European Community. Moreover, sheep fit in well with traditional patterns of United Kingdom farming, particularly on the hills and uplands.Pigs, poultry and eggs44. Output of these products represented about 20 per cent of theoutput of the United Kingdom agricultural industry in 1974/75. The pigherd has been seriously cut back in 1974. While the United Kingdom isalmost self-sufficient in eggs, poultry and pork, imports of bacon and pig-meat products cost about  300 million in 1974. The expansion of produc-tion in this sector reflects a high and increasing level of efficiency in feedconversion. Continuing improvements in efficiency would reduce the rela-tive price of these products in, real terms. Higher output of bacon andpigmeat products is limited by the competition from imported supplies, par-ticularly from Denmark. In the period to 1980 United Kingdom producers of pork, poultry meat and eggs can satisfy the entire growth in demandforecast for these products. This is a reasonable objective for the industry.ASSESSING THE PRIORITIES45. The considerations in the preceding paragraphs point to the con-clusion that the higher domestic output of a number of products is likelyto be economically worthwhile. It is in the national interest, however, to concentrate on those commodities which seem capable of yielding thegreatest economic return to the nation. An examination has been madeof the relative economic benefits of expanding the production of fourenterprises which are competitors for the use of land dairying, lowlandbeef production, cereals and sugar beet. The margin in 1980 of output per acre (valued at the price of alternative, namely, imported supplies) overthe resources needed for the extra production has been estimated for these products. The potential net import savings per acre by 1980 were alsoestimated. Both estimates are of value, the margin of output over resourcesproviding an important yardstick, since it can be said to indicate thesurplus accruing to the economy from a particular enterprise.
46. A comparison was made between (a) an average herd with the milkgoing for manufacture and surplus calves raised for beef and (b) a lowlandpure beef herd. The assessment for 1980 indicates that dairying, togetherwith the beef from the calves produced, would be likely to offer the UnitedKingdom as a member of the European Community a greater margin overresources used and a larger import saving per acre than lowland beef. Ifthe United Kingdom were outside the European Community, the advantageof one enterprise over the other would be small. It is also necessary totake account of the likely returns over resources used in the processingwhich takes place beyond the farm gate. This also points in favour of the dairy enterprise.47. Although the national economic interest points to a greater emphasis on dairying, together with beef from the dairy herd, rather than pure beefherds in the period to 1980, there will of course be areas or individual cases where the land, financial resources or the preference of the producerpoint to a beef herd rather than dairying in order to make the best use ofthe land available. In particular, in upland areas beef production will oftenmake better use of resources. The quality and export markets may also beexpected to continue to offer a premium to this type of beef production.48. A similar comparison of the relative benefits of cereal productionand sugar beet production has also been made. Sugar beet is forecast to offer the United Kingdom, as a member of the European Community, both ahigher margin of output over inputs and a larger net import saving per acre than cereals. The advantage of sugar beet production in terms of netimport saving is particularly clear-cut, given the likely high cost of imported supplies of processed sugar. If the United Kingdom were outside theEuropean Community, the relative advantage of sugar beet would probablybe no less pronounced.49. This comparison of,output and costs gives a fairly reliable measureof the relative merits, from the national point of view, of expansion of alternative enterprises at the margin. It is also necessary to take account,however, of other factors such as possible quota restraint on sugar beetproduction, commitments to developing countries or the availability of pro-cessing capacity. The Government have done this in setting out below theirprojection of possible higher output by 1980.A PROJECTION OF HIGHER OUTPUT BY 198050. The Governments assessment of the best use of resources and ofthe needs of consumers, processors and traders, as well as of farmers, results in the projection of possible output increases by 1980 which is given inTable 2 below. This would be in line with a continued growth in the netproduct of the agricultural industry of about 2\ per cent a year.

51. Circumstances can change considerably between now and the early1980s and it would be wrong to regard this set of projections as a fixed set of targets. But it does indicate what, on the basis of the estimated trend of import prices, looks likely to be the most profitable pattern of higheroutput and the most worthwhile in terms of resource gains. The commoditypriorities which underlie the projections will help to shape the Governmenfsapproach to agricultural support policy.RESOURCES AND POSSIBLE RESTRAINT ON OUTPUT52. The growth in the agricultural industry in recent years has beenstimulated by bigger capital investment in response to the prospect of higherprofitability within the European Community. Higher rates of capital grantencouraged further fixed capital investment. The agricultural industry reliesto a greater extent than most other industries on funds generated from itsown income. The Farmers&apos; Unions have estimated the extra capital costs for their projected level of output at  425- 500 million at current pricesbetween now and 1980. This represents an annual level of net capital forma-tion rather below that of recent years and, given reasonable profitability,it should be within the industry&apos;s capacity to finance this.53. It is necessary also to consider what physical restraints there maybe on the achievement of higher output in the period to 1980. Somefertilisers are now in short supply. Potash will soon be available fromdomestic production. Phosphates are likely to be available in adequatequantity, although there has been a very substantial price increase recently.The principal problem in the first part of the period will be nitrogenousfertiliser. In the near future United Kingdom production may not be fully adequate to meet the anticipated extra demand for ammonia for industrialuse and production of nitrogenous fertiliser. By 1980, however, nitrogenousfertiliser prices may fall in real terms, as additional world capacity is brought into operation, particularly in countries with good resources of natural gas. \54. The Government are aware of concern in the agricultural industrylest investment and higher output from our farms might be prejudiced bynew and proposed forms of capital taxation; and by other developments suchas pressure for more rigorous control of effluents and agrochemicals andfor the preservation of the traditional appearance of the countryside. the projected increases in the output of British agriculture should not resultin any undesirable changes in the environment; the continuing improvementof grazing land and of hill land can contribute to a better-looking as wellas to a more productive countryside. The Governmenfs conclusions in this white Paper can be reconciled with their commitment to proper safeguards for the environment.55. In the light of the output projection in paragraph 50, the Govern-ment undertake to keep under close review the level of capital investment in home agriculture and the availability of credit facilities. They welcome the decision of the Economic Development Committee for Agriculture, on
which all sides of the industry are represented, to review the resources ofland, labour and finance available to the agricultural industry up to 1980.In addition, the Government are setting up certain specific studies on issues which could be important to the achievement of the potential growth in agricultural net output and to potential import saving. These studies includefurther work on hard wheat production in the United Kingdom; and review of the effect of capital taxation on agricultural production.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS56. The Government have discussed the long term prospects for british agriculture with representatives of farmers, workers, landowners and thefood and drink industries. They have taken account of likely future levels of world and European Community food prices in sterling terms, and ofthe competing claims on our national resources. They have reached thefollowing conclusions (i) the likely levels of world and Community prices for major food-stuffs between now and the early 1980s, and the risks of possibleshortage and sharp price fluctuation, justify a policy of expansion offood production in the United Kingdom;(ii) the net product of the agricultural industry should be capable of a continuing expansion of about 2i per cent a year on average, andthis is the objective at which the Government and industry should aim;(iii) within this overall objective most benefit is likely to come fromhigher output of milk (with its by-product, the beef from the dairy herd) and sugar beet. Cereals and sheepmeat should also make a significant contribution. A projection of the possible pattern of higher output in the early 1980s is set out in paragraph 50.57. The Government will frame their agricultural policies in the light ofthese conclusions. They propose to continue discussions with the interests concerned during the coming months so as to determine whether there arespecific measures which it would be right and practicable to take in further-ance of these aims. They look to the agricultural and food industries, withtheir fine record of past achievement, to work with them in bringing about an expansion of economic agricultural production in the interests of thenation.      j
