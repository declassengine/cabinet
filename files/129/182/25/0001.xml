DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government(75) 50 COPY NO18 April 1975CABINETBRITISH LEY LAND:  THE RYDER report memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerINTRODUCTION1. The British Leyland Motor Corporation (BL) provides direct employment for over 170, 000 people (and indirect employment for 800, 000)in this country;  it accounted last year for nearly  500 million of exports.Last December BL appealed to the Government for financial aid; weguaranteed  50 million of bank borrowing (which is expected to run out next month) and we set up a team under Sii Don Ryder to conduct, in consultationwith BL and the trades unions, an overall assessment of BL&apos;s presentsituation and future prospects, covering corporate strategy, investments,markets, organisation, employment, productivity, management/labour relations, profitability and finance.    The team reported on 27 March;  a group of Ministers, comprising the Secretaries of State for Employment,Industry and Trade, the Attorney General and myself have been consideringtheir conclusions.THE RYDER report.        The main conclusions of the report are:-a. BL should be retained at roughly its present size as amanufacturer of a wide range of motor vehicles (including massproduction and specialist cars, buses and trucks).b. The present chairman (Lord Stokes) and Managing Director(Mr J Barber) should resign; the company should be reorganised intofour main divisions under a new chairman and there should be other changes in the BL Board.c. There should be a capital investment programme leading tothe introduction of new models and an immediate and massiveprogramme to modernise plant and equipment.    Over  1, 500 million at constant prices ( 2, 800 million in inflated terms) will be neededover the next 7 years.    The Ryder team consider that half of this1
money can be generated from within the company, but 1, 400 million (in inflated terms) will have to come from outsidesources,     900 million of this is required up to 1978 and shouldbe found by increased bank overdraft ( 200 million), a new equitysubscription ( 200 million) and long term loans ( 500 million).    an estimated further  500 million in long term loans would be needed in the period 1978-82. jid. The team consider that, with this investment, the company should achieve a positive cash flow by 1982.    This will dependhowever not only on market penetration, but on a substantial improvement in productivity arising from the investment programme, rationalisation of the range of vehicles produced,improved management performance, the reduction of over-manningand the co-operation of the workforce in avoiding industrial disputes.e. A new structure of joint mianagement/union councils,committees and conferences should be set up, in which the shop stewards would play an important part.    The aim would be to involve the workers fully in a new approach to the company^ future.f. The Government should provide, as an interim measure,a further guarantee of some  35 million for bank borrowing (allguarantees would lapse with the provision of new equity).g. The financial structure of BL should be reorganised; theGovernment should underwrite a  200 million rights issue andshould offer to buy out the existing shareholders at the same priceas the proposed rights issue - lOp a share.    If all the existingshareholders took up the offer to purchase, and the Governmentsubscribed all the rights issue, the total cost would be  260 million.The team estimate that though not all the shareholders will acceptthe Governmenfs offer, the Governments eventual shareholdingwould exceed 65 per cent and might exceed 75 per cent of the enlarged capital.    As part of the financial reconstruction, theGovernment should offer to lend up to   500 million to BL between1976 and 1978, each tranche being made conditional upon a satisfactoryrecord of industrial relations and improved productivity.    Thequestion of the source of the  500 million required beyond 1978would be left open for the time being, but the Government shouldbe prepared to make the funds available.h. To enable the programme proposed by the team to be met,the Government decision should be made and announced by30 April 1975.2
COMMENTS ON THE recommendations.        We have looked at these proposals, as they relate to the future ofBL and in the light of broader economic implications for the country as awhole and we are of the view that the Report should be accepted as a basis for the Government&apos;s policy towards British Leyland.    We have not reached this view lightly.    Large issues are at stake - there are important implications for employment, the balance of payments, public expenditure and industrial efficiency.    The scale of the investment needed is immense,and raises the fundamental question of whether the resources involvedcould not be deployed to better advantage elsewhere.    The forecast return on investment for the next 7 years is low, and this forecast is dependent on british Leyland&apos;s maintaining its share of the home market and increasingits share of the overseas - particularly the European - market, over aperiod of increasingly intense competition.    Success is criticallydependent upon greatly improved management and the full co-operation ofthe workforce.4. Having said all this, we still consider that there is no practical alternative to following the general line suggested in the Ryder Report.Not to do so would be to allow the largest British motor manufacturer,and a major exporter, to go out of business, affecting the livelihood of approaching one million people.    The case for deploying the resourceselsewhere may be strong, but the transitional loss to output and the balanceof payments would be severe, and not such as we could contemplate withoutgrave disquiet.    We accept therefore that there is no practical alternative to setting out along the road signposted by the Ryder Report.    But wesuggest that the precise formulation of the Government&apos;s commitment toback British Leyland requires great care.    On the one hand it has to carryimmediate conviction with the companyrs customers and to secure the effective and continuing co-operation of management and workforce.    Onthe other it has to allow for adequate checkpoints and flexibility as circumstances develop.    We must moreover prevent any expectation thatthe Government will finance any wage bill irrespective of performance and productivity.5.        We therefore recommend that:-i. The Ryder Report should be accepted as the basis for future policy towards BJL,ii. The Government should announce their intention to take amajority shareholding in the company;  should agree to underwritethe equity subscription of  200 million and should offer to buy outthe existing shareholders on the terms recommended in the RyderReport.3
iii. The Government should stand ready to provide 500 of additional capital up to 1978, in the form of eitherlong-term loan or additional equity.    The exact amount andphasing of this contribution would be subject to review on thelines suggested in the Secretary of State&apos;s draft statement (at Annex).iv. No commitments should be made at the present time forthe provision of finance for the period after 1978.v. An Affirmative Resolution of Parliament should be sought to give a further guarantee of up to  50 million of bank borrowing;but no commitment should be given to BL until the Board acquiesce in the Government1 s proposals.vi. The Secretary of State for Industry should make a statement to Parliament on Thursday 24 April on the lines of the draft at the annex;  and should simultaneously publish the edited version of theRyder Report as a Parliamentary paper.vii. The Secretary of State for Industry and Sir Don Ryder?should, on Wednesday 23 April, see the Chairman and the managing Director of BL; the Board of the company;  and then theTrades Union Congress and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and engineering Unions;  to explain the Governments decision and to seek their co-operation in achieving a successful implementation of their proposals,6.        In addition to these specific recommendations there are two questions for Cabinet decision.    The first concerns discussions with the Commissionof the European Economic Community (e.c.), on which the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary has submitted a paper.    The second is the formof legislation on which the Attorney General has also submitted a paper.conclusion.        I invite the Cabinet toa. Endorse the recommendations at 5i. to vii. above.b. Decide the line to be taken with the e.c. Commission.c. Decide the form of legislation,D W treasury Chambers18 April 19754
DRAFT   ^TATHlELfT-BRITISH LETLAITD -With permission, I should li^a&quot;&apos;tb.&apos;.make a statement about British Leyland.     Is the House will be aware,following the decision in December 1974 to guaranteeadditional bank borrowings needed to meet the company&apos;sworking capital requirements, the Government set up ateam, under   the leadership of Sir Don Ryder, theGovernment&apos;s Industrial Adviser, to help in framing a longer term scheme of support for British Leyland&apos;sinvestment programme.       They have made recommendationsboth on the reconstruction of British Leyland, involving a substantial degree of public ownership, and on the strategy and measures to he adopted over the ensuing periodof years.       Copies of their Report are available in the vote Office.     As I told the House at the time of the debate on the guarantee, it has been necessary to delete some sections containing commercially confidential information.2      I shall be laying before the House a draft Order seekingsanction for an increase of up to  50 million in guaranteedworking capital which will be required immediately.   Thiswill be followed later by an injection of  200 million of equity capital.       I shall, in due course, be introducing a Bill to provide the necessary powers to implement theGovernment&apos;s decisions.
3 .     The report&quot; estimates that, on top   of the continuation of existing short term bank facilities of around  200million, and the injection of  200 million of equity, the strategy put forward would require capital financing to theextent of a further  500 million of loans up to the end ofSeptember 1978-       These loans would have to come wholly orlargely from Government funds, while an additional requirement of  500 million is provisionally estimated in the period up to the end of 1982 - a total requirement of exbemalfinance amounting to  1,400 million.     The report envisagesthat, following the initial injection of equity capital in1975? there will be review points in each subsequentyear before a further tranche of funds is provided, to assess the contribution being made to the reduction ofindustrial disputes and the improvement in productivity.This is a condition to which the Government attach greatimportance c4-      On these figures British Leyland would be receivingcapital finance from public funds on a scale comparable tothe Government financing of various existing nationalised industries.   The Government accept that in principle theyshould be prepared to see that the requirement of  500million of loan funds by 1978 is met; it is our intentionto have a majority shareholding in British Leyland and, ifnecessary, some of these further funds will be in the formof equity.
5      In addition to the designation- of review points beforethe injection of successive tranches of funds, it willbe appropriate in the first instance for the Company,after the new management has taken stock of its situationand prospects, to put forward in consultation with theunions more specific investment and operating programmes which would require Government clearance.   These would berolled forward in an annual review, under arrangementsbroadly analogous to those in operation for the nationalised industries and taking account of the new system of planning agreements.   It is planned that the publicly owned majorityshareholding in British Leyland should come under theNational Enterprise Board, once this new body has been setup, along with various other existing Government shareholdingsin companies.       The specific arrangements for scrutiny ofBritish Leyland&apos;s plans and budgets, including approval ofits capital&apos; financing year by year and for monitoring its performance and profitability will, therefore, have to be worked out with the National Enterprise Board in a mannerdesigned both to satisfy the criteria for the provisionof public funds on such a large scale and at the same timeto enable the Company to operate on an effective commercial basis moving towards real industrial democracy but without day to day Government intervention.&apos;   These planswould in due course be embodied in a planning agreementwith the Government.
6      In talcing these decisions, the Government endorse theview that British Leyland will remain a magor vehicle producerwhich can compete commercially in world markets if urgentaction is taken to remedy weaknesses disclosed in the report*Act5.on on the financial reconstruction of the company must be initiated by the company itself and, following decisions in principle by the Government,, urgent discussions are nowin train with the company,,7      Bringing about improvement in the Companyrs performancewill require the full co-operation of the work-force.     TheTrades Unions have already been consulted in the preparationof the report and the Government will expect the management of the company to undertake consultation with the workers onimplementation of the report and to set up con.sulta.tivemachinery as recommended In it.   It will be the Government5sobjective to secure the joint effort of everyone involvedin. making a success of this new departure In the field ofpublic ownership in manufacturing industry as part oftheir broad industrial strategy.      With this in. mind further discussions will be held with those concerned and I shallreport to the House more fully when the&apos;draft orderseeking authority for further guarantees is tsbled-.&quot;.&apos; for debateo18 APRIL 1975
