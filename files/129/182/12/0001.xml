S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 37 COPY NO18 March 1975CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  HEALTH CAPITAL programme for 1975-76Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. Last week I was asked to withhold the issue of letters to the chairmen of Regional Health Authorities informing them of their allocationsunder the Health Capital Programme for 1975-76 (CC(75) 12th Conclusions,Minute 7)0    Annexed are the terms in which I proposed to announce this programme in Parliament,2. The postponement of an announcement is giving rise to considerableunrest and speculation within the National Health Service (NHS), because it is so long overdue.    These allocations have already been much delayedbecause of the difficulties in settling public expenditure for 1975-76;  andthe beginning of the financial year to which they relate is less than two weeks away.    We have already offended against every canon of sensibleplanning and good management by delaying the announcement this far.To procrastinate further is intolerable, and will serve only to disruptplanning^, waste money and lower morale.3. I can understand why the Chancellor is asking Ministers to make no fresh announcements on public expenditure which will carry substantialcommitments beyond 1975-76 without prior reference to the Treasury.The Capital Programme that I wish to announce for 1975-76 is not ofcourse a new commitment.    The allocations are within the terms of theWhite Paper on Public Expenditure.    Inevitably the programme involvessome forward commitment of resources in the years after 1975-76.    Thisis unavoidable with a Health Capital Programme whose major projectstake so long to complete.    Successive Governments have found that withouta reasonable number of major starts in the Capital Programme they endup spending money on too many smaller projects of lesser value and makelittle impact on our ageing stock of hospitals - the average age of hospitalbuildings is now about 65 years;   some hospitals are over 200 years old.The only way we can avoid these forward commitments is to impose thekind of moratorium on major scheme starts for two or three years impliciton our predecessors1 Public Expenditure cuts in December 1973 and whichwe have eased.1
4. I have kept the forward commitments in this Capital Programme tothe bare minimum,  so that there is some flexibility of movement in theyears from 1976-77 onwards,    I have gone for a programme with a balancedblend of longer and shorter term projects,,    I appreciate that the HealthCapital Programme has to reflect our general strategy on public expenditure,but any tinkering with the 1975-76 programme will destroy the internalcoherence of the programme that we have devised.50 The programme has been drawn up after three months of consultationwith the Health Authorities.    My Department has been urging health authorities to demonstrate economic realism and make tough choices inidentifying their priorities.    The Health Authorities and my Departmenthave invested a great deal of time and effort in producing a balanced andrealistic programme.    To change the programme now would cause afurther precipitous drop in NHS morale, which is already at an all time lowfollowing reorganisation and nearly two years of industrial disputes.6, I must emphasise that this Capital Programme is far from being anextravagant one.    It excludes a great many new hospital projects for many parts of the country where these are long overdue.    As soon as it isannounced, I fully expect a storm of protests from the many parts of thecountry who will be disappointed because their long awaited priority scheme shave been excluded from the programme yet again eg Leeds, Sheffield,Chesterfield, West^n Super Mare, Nexvh&amp;m,    I shall of course continue tosee if these important excluded projects can be incorporated into theprogramme, but usually the only way of doing this is by phasing the buildingover a longer period thereby increasing the forward commitment and reducing the room for manoeuvre in the future.    Any amendment of thisalready pared-down programme can only put off the start of these excludedprojects even further into the future, and cause an even greater outcry, not least from the medical profession who will cite this as another example ofGovernment neglect of the NHS.    Any further delay in the announcement ofthe programme for 1975-76 will cause more pent-up frustration and makethe task even more difficult.7.        In the circumstances I must ask my colleagues to agree that Ishould proceed with the announcement of the 1975-76 Capital allocations to Health Authorities in the terms set out in the Annex.B A department of Health and Social Security18 March 19752
To ask  the Secretary of  State for Social  Services whethershe  is   in a position to announce the content  of  the healthcapital programme for 1975/76 and  if  she will make astatement.SUGGESTED reply  informed the House on 2 December of  the financial constraintswithin which I have had  to work in formulating the healthcapital programme for 1975/76,  and also of   the developments in the NHS  to which I attach particular priority.    We facedthe prospect when we took office  in March 1974 that  if wecould not restore  some of the 20% cut  announced  in December 1 973by the previous administration, we would have faced a completemoratorium on all major  scheme starts for 2 or 3 years.     in deciding  the  capital programme for next  year  the Governmenthas been able to lift  this moratorium 1-i b-l  even so many highly desirable schemes have had to be postponed and some will haveto be redesigned.    The programme wi 11^ however ,  provide  for continuing expansion of  health centre construction,  asatisfactory level  of work on essential minor  schemes,   maint-maintenance of  our medical  student   intake targets and of  thepsychiatric  and geriatric programmes,  and also for  the  first time a substantial attack on those aspects of reducingwaiting lists which can be resolved by capital provision.I am notifying Regional Health Authorities of  their allocations.These are listed  in the following  table which indicates,subject  to the approval  of estimates by Parliament,  the total capital  expenditure which I  estimate will  be  incurred  in eachRegion in 1975/76:Regional Health Authority Capital Expenditure  millionNorthern 18.8Yorkshire 26.2Trent 35.6East Anglia 12.north West  Thames 19.5CONFIDENTIALI/cont continued
